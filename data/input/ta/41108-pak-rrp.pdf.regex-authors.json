No adverse environmental impact was identified.  \nAssessment   \nSocial Safeguard  Involuntary resettlement: Category C \nAssessment  Impact on indigenous people: Category C \nNo involuntary resettlement or impact on indigenous people is expected \nfrom implementation of the Program. \n \nRationale  The  growth  and  development  of  well-functioning  capital  markets, \nparticularly  equity  and  long-term  debt  (bonds),  generates  significant \nbenefits. Capital markets facilitate the mobilization of financial resources \nand  their  efficient  allocation  into  productive  investments  by  providing \nefficient  savings  vehicles  for  retail  and  institutional  investors  and \ndiversifying funding sources for enterprises. Diversification also makes the \ncorporate and financial sectors more robust to shocks, which enhances \nthe sustainability of economic development.  \n \nPakistan has made progress with capital market reforms since the 1990s. \nThe enabling legal, regulatory, and institutional framework for the capital \nmarket has been strengthened; the financial health of most ailing financial \ninstitutions restored; a large number of state-owned institutions have been \nprivatized;  and  competition  invigorated.  However,  domestic  capital \nmarkets do not yet play a significant role in financial intermediation and \nresource mobilization.  \n \nBuilding on achievements thus far, the Government is planning to launch a \nsecond generation of capital market reforms to facilitate mobilization of \nfinancial resources for productive investment and employment generation. \nThese reforms also aim at a balanced development of the financial sector, \nwhich will reduce systemic vulnerabilities in a bank-dominated financial \nsystem.  ", "ii   \nThe  Government  plans  to  put  special  emphasis  on  strengthening  the \nenabling  environment  for  pension  funds  and  other  nonbank  financial \ninstitutions,  given  the  strong  causal  relationship  between  the  level  of \ndevelopment  of  institutional  investors  and  the  deepening  of  capital \nmarkets. While limited supply of suitable assets, including corporate equity \nand debt, clearly hampers the development of institutional investors, the \nrelative  underdevelopment  of  contractual  savings  schemes  offered  by \ninstitutional investors limits the demand for securities.  \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  supported  financial  sector \nreforms in Pakistan since mid-1990s through two significant programs. \nThe Government has requested ADB\u2019s support for its renewed capital \nmarket development initiative in continuation of past assistance. A quick-\ndisbursing program will help leverage the Government\u2019s policy reforms \nand provide necessary financial resources. \n \nImpact and  The impact of the Program will be enhanced economic growth through a \nOutcome  more efficient and balanced financial system. The Program\u2019s outcome will \n  be  increased  resource  mobilization  through  the  capital  markets  for \nproductive investment and employment generation by providing efficient \nsavings  vehicles  for  retail  and  institutional  investors,  and  diversified \nfunding sources for enterprises. Such diversification will also make the \ncorporate and financial sectors more resilient to shocks.  \n \nThe Program will (i) support the development of institutional investors to \nfacilitate  long-term  capital  formation  and  increase  the  demand  for \nsecurities, (ii) improve the efficiency of securities markets to increase the \nsupply  of  corporate  securities  and  optimize  the  allocation  of  financial \nresources into productive investment, and (iii) strengthen the governance \nof capital markets to improve market transparency and protect investors. \n \nFinancing Plan  ADB will support the Government\u2019s second generation of capital market \nreforms under the Program by providing a program loan of $400 million \nfrom the ordinary capital resources of ADB under ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 15-year \nterm, including a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment \ncharge of 0.75% per year, and such other terms and conditions as set \nforth in the draft Loan Agreement.  \n \nProgram Period  The Program will be completed in 2 years, by 30 June 2009. The loan will \nand Tranching  be  released  in  two  tranches.  The  first  tranche  of  $200 million  will be \nreleased following satisfaction of the first tranche release conditions and \nafter loan effectiveness. The second tranche of $200 million is expected to \nbe released between 6 and 18 months after release of the first tranche \nsubject to the Government meeting the conditions specified for its release. \n \nExecuting  Ministry of Finance. \nAgency \n ", "  iii\nImplementation  The Government will establish a Program Coordination Unit in the Ministry \nArrangements  of Finance to coordinate program implementation. The unit will cooperate \nclosely with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan and \nMinistry of Privatization, which will act as the implementing agencies. \n   \nCounterpart  The Government will ensure that the local currency funds generated by \nFunds  the loan are used to (i) support the costs of reforms to be initiated and \nimplemented under the Program, and (ii) finance expenditures for  general \ndevelopment purposes of the country. \n \nProgram Benefits  The  Program  will  facilitate  the  mobilization  of  financial  resources  for \nand Beneficiaries  productive  investment  and  employment  generation  by  supporting  the \n  development of corporate bond and equity capital markets in Pakistan. It \nwill help to ensure balanced development of the financial sector, which will \nreduce systemic vulnerabilities in the bank-dominated financial system.  \n \nThe policy and regulatory reforms supported under the Program will help \nto significantly increase the number of corporate bond and equity issues, \nboth primary and secondary. This will facilitate the mobilization of financial \nresources for long-term private sector investment, including infrastructure \ninvestment. Further, the reforms will facilitate capital mobilization through \nstrengthening and increasing contractual savings. This is beneficial not \nonly from a social security point of view; it will also increase and stabilize \nthe  demand  for  securities  issued  by  the  private  sector  and  the \nGovernment. \n \nThe  Program  will  enhance  market  efficiency  and  transparency,  and \nimprove investor protection by strengthening governance of the capital \nmarket. Further, the program-supported reforms will help fight corruption \nby (i) strengthening the independence, accountability, and transparency of \nthe regulatory body in charge of securities markets; and (ii) increasing the \ntransparency  of  state-owned  enterprise  privatization  through  a  capital \nmarket oriented privatization policy. \n \nThe Program will increase the competitiveness of financial groups and the \neffectiveness of financial sector regulation and supervision in line with \ninternational best practices, which will in turn reduce systemic risks.  \n \nThe capital market-oriented privatization approach supported under the \nProgram will also (i) help increase budget revenues, since investors will \ntend  to  pay  more  for  shares  if  an  individual  offer  is  embedded  in  a \ntransparent and credible overall privatization strategy; (ii) support capital \nmarket  development  by  increasing  liquidity;  and  (iii)  improve  the \nperformance of enterprises by infusing greater market discipline amongst \ncompanies. \n \nRisks and  Macroeconomic  stability  is  essential  for  financial  sector  development. \nAssumptions  Macroeconomic risks are mitigated by prudent fiscal and monetary policies \nand  high  expected  economic  growth  rates.  Pakistan  has  made  good \nprogress on these fronts in recent years. Moving forward, the Program has \n ", "iv   \nto assume that (i) Pakistan will not suffer from any adverse geopolitical \nchanges  affecting  its  external  and  internal  stability,  and  (ii)  that  the \nsuccessive Governments will remain strongly committed to capital market \nreforms. The presidential elections scheduled for late 2007 may result in \npolicy changes in some areas. However, economic policies are unlikely to \nbe  fundamentally  changed,  given  the  high  degree  of  continuity  in \neconomic policy making in Pakistan over the last decade and the broad \nconsensus for economic reforms, including financial sector reform. \n \nAnother risk is that draft legislation will be enacted with substantial delays \nand/or may not be in line with international best practice due to vested \ninterest and lack of understanding by lawmakers. To minimize this risk, \nlegislative changes related to the Program were drafted during program \npreparation  or  will  be  drafted  under  the  TA  to  ensure  quality  of  the \nlegislation. Further, TA will be provided to support the Government in \nundertaking and sustaining stakeholder consultations. \n \nGood  regulatory  governance  cannot  be  sustained  without  good  public \nsector governance in general. The latter includes effective measures to \nreduce  corruption,  a  sound  approach  to  competition  policies,  effective \nlegal and judicial systems, and an arm\u2019s-length approach to government \nownership. A successful continuation of the Government\u2019s anticorruption \nand private sector development policies is therefore a critical pre-condition \nfor reaching the Program\u2019s objectives. \n \nTechnical  The accompanying TA for $1,000,000 will help the Government implement \nAssistance  the  reforms  under  the  Program.  The  TA  will  (i)  raise  professional \nstandards among market participants by supporting the Securities Institute \nof  Pakistan,  (ii)  strengthen  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for \ninstitutional investors, and (iii) enhance the strategic planning capacity of \nthe Ministry of Privatization. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nthe Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Second  Generation  of  Capital  Market  Reform \nProgram (the Program). The report also describes a proposed technical assistance (TA) grant \nfor Supporting the Second Generation of Capital Market Reform Program and, if the Board \napproves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will \napprove the TA. The design and monitoring framework for the Program is in Appendix 1. \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT1 \n2.  The Pakistan economy grew strongly over the past 4 years, at an average rate of 6.5%. \nPrivate  consumption,  boosted  by  rapid  expansion  in  consumer  credit  and  higher  worker\u2019s \nremittances, was a lead contributor to economic growth. The rise of investment spending to \n20%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP),  supported  by  improved  business  confidence  and \nincreasing  inflows  of  foreign  direct  investment  also  contributed.  However,  national  savings \ndeclined due to rising consumer demand, negative real interest rates on bank deposits, and \nscarcity of alternative savings vehicles. Strong macroeconomic policies, high GDP growth, \nincreases in pro-poor spending, and burgeoning workers\u2019 remittances all contributed to a steep \ndecline in the incidence of poverty and the unemployment rate. Since Fiscal Year (FY) 2005, the \nGovernment has pursued a pro-growth fiscal policy. Development outlays have risen sharply. \nSpending in pro-poor sectors increased from 4.8% of GDP in fiscal year (FY) 2005 to 5.6% the \nfollowing year. Alongside this, unplanned spending on relief and reconstruction in areas affected \nby  the  devastating  October  2005  earthquake  also  contributed  to  an  increase  in  public \nexpenditures. \n3.  Strong  demand  for  goods  and  services  has  outstripped  supply  and  generated \ninflationary pressures. However, after peaking in 2005 at above 11%, annual inflation declined \nto 6.6% in January 2007 as a result of tighter monetary policy. The exchange rate of the \nPakistan rupee was kept at parity with the US dollar. With higher domestic inflation, the real \nexchange  rate  has,  therefore,  increased.  This,  together  with  strong  domestic  demand, \ncontributed to a significant deterioration in the current account of the balance of payments. In \nFY2006, the current account deficit (excluding official transfers) more than tripled to $5.7 billion \nor 4.4% of GDP. The deficit was mainly financed through foreign direct investment inflows and \nconcessional  loans  from  multilateral  development  agencies.  The  current  account  deficit \ncontinued  to  widen  in  FY2007.  This  development  has  provided  strong  incentives  for  the \nGovernment  to  continue  structural  reforms,  including  privatization,  to  strengthen  the \ncompetitiveness of exports and attract foreign investment. However, it has also increased the \nshort-term need for balance of payment support. Pakistan\u2019s external debt increased by $1.6 \nbillion to $36.9 billion in the second half of 2006. As a percentage of GDP, external debt \nremained on a downward trajectory, declining to 25.4% in December 2006 from 31% in FY2005. \nThis trend is forecast to continue under the debt sustainability framework of the International \nMonetary Fund for Pakistan for the period from FY2001 to FY2010.2 \n                                                 \n1  This section should be read in conjunction with the country information provided in the following publications: Asian \nDevelopment Bank. 2007.

The growth and development of well-functioning capital markets, particularly markets for \nequity and long-term debt (bonds), generate significant economic benefits. Capital markets \nfacilitate the mobilization of financial resources and their efficient allocation into productive \ninvestments by providing efficient savings vehicles for retail and institutional investors, and \ndiversifying funding sources for enterprises. This diversification also makes the corporate and \nfinancial sectors more resilient to shocks, which enhances the sustainability of development. \n5.  Pakistan has made progress with capital market reforms since 1998, when a year-long \neconomic and financial crisis culminated in a breakdown of the capital market. Since then, with \nsupport  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  the  enabling  legal,  regulatory,  and \ninstitutional framework for the capital market has been strengthened; the financial health of most \nailing financial institutions restored; a large number of state-owned institutions privatized; and \ncompetition invigorated. Yet, domestic capital markets do not play a significant role in financial \nintermediation and resource mobilization.  \n6.  This is confirmed by macroeconomic data: In FY2005, national savings amounted to \n16.4% of GDP in Pakistan, i.e., the same level as in FY2000 (Table 1). The percentage of \nsavings intermediated by the financial system amounted to 7.5% of GDP (46% of national \nsavings) in FY2005, up from 4.8% of GDP (29% of national savings) in FY2000. However, this \nincrease  was  due  to  successful  banking  reforms,  which  resulted  in  enhanced  banking \nintermediation.  In  contrast,  intermediation  through  nonbank  financial  institutions  (NBFIs) \ndeclined over the last 6 years. \nTable 1: Trends and Structure of Financial Savings  \n(percent of gross domestic product) \nItem    FY2000  FY2001  FY2002  FY2003  FY2004  FY2005 \nNational Savings  16.5  16.5  18.6  20.6  18.7  16.4 \nFinancial Savings  4.8  4.4  5.9  10.0  7.8  7.5 \n  Bank Deposits  0.7  3.1  3.3  5.4  5.4  6.5 \n  Investments in NSS  2.4  1.1  1.9  2.8  0.0  (0.7) \n  Currency in Circulation   1.8  0.5  1.3  1.3  1.5  1.3 \n  Deposits of NBFIs  (0.3)  (0.3)  (0.9)  0.0  0.1  0.0 \n  Mutual Funds  0.2  0.0  0.2  0.5  0.7  0.3 \n  Government Funds  0.1  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0 \n( ) = negative, FY = fiscal year, NSS = national savings scheme, NBFI = nonbank financial institution. \nSource: State Bank of Pakistan. \n \n7.  Sector data support this view: Total financial sector assets amounted to 79% of GDP in \n2005 ($87 billion equivalent), up from 73% ($50 billion) in 2001. Over the same period, the \nshare of banking assets within the financial sector increased from 63.7% to 70.4%, while the \nshare of the state-owned Central Directorate of National Savings, i.e., the biggest institutional \ninvestor in the country, fell from 25.7% to 18.1% of total financial sector assets. All other NBFIs \ntogether accounted for 11.6% of total financial sector assets in FY2005, marginally up from \n10.5% in FY2001. In conclusion, Pakistan\u2019s financial sector is less balanced now than 6 years \nago. Banking has gained ground in relative as well as absolute terms. \n \n8.  In contrast, capital market instruments are not yet an important source of corporate \nfinance. Capital raised through equity and bond issues together was equivalent to only 0.3% of \nGDP in 2005. Banking products are still much more relevant for resource mobilization and ", "    3 \n   \ncapital formation than securities. While this is the case in many countries, banking system \ndevelopment in Pakistan is not out of touch with that of most comparable economies, whereas \ncapital market development lags (Table 2). \n9.

Structure and Institutions \n10.  Pakistan\u2019s  capital  market  comprises  three  stock  exchanges  based  in  Karachi, \nIslamabad, and Lahore; a National Clearing and Settlement System; a  Central Depositary \nCompany; about 300 brokers; and two rating agencies. All three exchanges are fully private and \nmutually owned by their broker members. However, preparations for the demutualization of all \nthree exchanges are under way. More than 700 of the approximately 2,800 registered public \ncompanies are listed at one or more stock exchanges. Only listed companies can make public \nissuance of securities in Pakistan. Further, there is a large number of NBFIs including 54 \ninsurance  companies,  40  mutual  funds,  5  development  financial  institutions,  8  investment \nbanks, 20 leasing companies, and others. Two state-owned institutions, the Central Directorate \nof National Savings and State Life Insurance Company, are the biggest institutional investors. \n11.  Since the 1990s the NBFI sector has transformed rapidly. The total number of NBFIs \nhas declined significantly and their financial soundness has improved. The share of state-owned \nNBFIs has declined, but is still substantial. In June 2006, insurance companies accounted for \nabout 34% of total NBFI assets, mutual funds 23%, and development financial institutions 18%. \nState-owned institutions account for about 77% of total insurance assets and 51% of total \nmutual  fund  assets.  Most  development  financial  institutions  are  foreign  sponsored.  Private \npension funds have yet to appear as a class of institutional investors in Pakistan. However, \nsome large private companies sponsor a variety of provident funds and pension schemes. \n12.  Banks are increasingly engaged in the capital market as issuer, investor, and provider of \ninvestment  banking  services.  A  number  of  banks  have  established  investment  banking \ndepartments  or  subsidiaries,  and  acquired  brokerage  houses.  Similarly,  some  NBFIs  and \nbrokers  have  acquired  commercial  banks.  Another  trend  is  the  formation  of  groups  of \ncompanies that include various financial institutions. Thus, a relatively complex web of corporate \nstructures is emerging in Pakistan, which calls for a sound policy and regulatory environment.    \n ", "4     \n   \n2.  Regulation and Supervision \n13.  The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) regulates and supervises \nthe activities of corporate entities and NBFIs under the 1984 Companies Ordinance, the 1969 \nSecurities Ordnance, and a number of other laws, including the 2000 Insurance Ordinance. \nSECP was set up in pursuance to the 1997 SECP Act. While SECP\u2019s mandate was initially \nrestricted to securities markets, responsibility for insurance and other NBFIs has been added \nover time. However, with regard to insurance, SECP shares its regulatory powers with the \nMinistry of Commerce. Commercial banks are regulated and supervised by the State Bank of \nPakistan (SBP). \n3.  Overall Market Development Trends \n14.  Since 2001, equity market capitalization and share prices have increased substantially in \nPakistan  with  annual  growth  rates  averaging  more  than  50%.  Equity  market  capitalization \nincreased from 9% of GDP in 2001 to 35% in 2006 ($45.5 billion equivalent). However, this was \nlower than in other Asian markets (Table 2). \n15.  The increase in market capitalization in Pakistan was largely the result of the listing of a \nnumber of large state-owned enterprises (SOEs) together with the growth in share prices rather \nthan  successful  capital  mobilization  through  equity  issues  (para.16).  Further,  the  market \nremains narrow. The 10 largest companies alone account for 55% of market capitalization. \nHowever, only an average of 20% of their shares has been floated. This, like in other countries \nin the region, is an important factor behind low market liquidity.  \n16.  While other countries in the region face similar problems with market outreach, Pakistan \nis clearly lagging in terms of resource mobilization through the capital market. In 2005, for \ninstance,  Pakistani  companies  issued  some  $68  million  equivalent  in  new  capital.  This \ncompares to $19.1 billion in India, $4 billion in the People\u2019s Republic of China, $3.7 in Thailand, \n$2 billion in Malaysia, $1 billion in Indonesia, and $900 million in the Philippines. The amounts \nof equity capital raised in Pakistan over the preceding years were even lower. Similarly, only \n$203 million equivalent of capital was raised through corporate bond issues in Pakistan in 2005. \nNevertheless, the number of bond issues has clearly increased as compared with the 1990s. \nWhile 9 corporate bonds were issued in 1995\u20131999, 68 corporate bonds were issued in 2000\u2013\n2005. \n17.  The market for government bonds is much larger than that for corporate bonds. Pakistan \ninvestment  bonds  (PIBs)  are  by  far  the  most  significant  type  of  securities  issued  by  the \nGovernment, with a 91% share of total outstanding federal government bonds (June 2005). In \nJune 2006, $5.1 billion equivalent (about 4% of GDP) of PIBs were in circulation. Maturities in \ncirculation are 3, 5, 10, 20, and 30 years. This compares to a maximum maturity period of \n7 years for corporate bonds.  \n18.  Derivative markets are almost nonexistent in Pakistan (with the exception of currency \nfutures and 1-month single-share futures) due to the underdevelopment of the underlying equity \nand bond markets. \n4.  Factors Driving the Market \n19.  Privatization  through  stock  exchanges  has  been  a  major  factor  driving  the  capital \nmarket,  together  with  macroeconomic  stabilization,  and\u2014to  a  lesser  degree\u2014international \ninvestor diversification, the development of domestic institutional investors, and other reforms. ", "    5 \n   \n20.  The Government has divested a large number of SOEs since the 1990s, some by listing \nand partial privatization through the stock exchange(s). This has clearly been the main driving \nforce  for  market  capitalization  and  share  prices.  Among  the  10  largest  listed  companies \n(para.15) are six SOEs, which together account for 42% of total market capitalization. Shares of \nSOEs offered for sale through the stock market are typically heavily oversubscribed, given the \nexpectation of subsequent increases in share prices which have frequently been substantial. \n21.  Undeniable progress has been made with other structural reforms that have led to \nsubstantial changes such as (i) a higher share of private enterprises in- and outside the financial \nsector; (ii) consolidation of the NBFI subsector, which now consists of a smaller number of \nbetter  capitalized  and  more  efficiently  managed  entities;  and  (iii)  a  better  regulatory  and \ninstitutional framework for capital markets. Further, efforts are under way to enhance corporate \ngovernance and disclosure, which is important because both figure prominently in investment \ndecisions. On the technical side, significant progress has been made in establishing electronic \nclearing  and  settlement  systems.  However,  that  has  yet  to  turn  the  capital  market  into  a \nsignificant source of capital formation. Moderate progress has, nevertheless, been made, as \nevidenced  by  the  increased  number  of  securities  issues.  SBP\u2019s  policy  to  increase  capital \nrequirements for banks has led a number of banks to raise capital through bond issues. \n22.  High  economic  growth,  consumer  demand,  and  higher  corporate  earnings  have \nfacilitated capital market development as compared with the 1990s. The same applies to the \nmonetary  environment.  The  exchange  rate  and  inflation  outlook  stabilized  after  1999, \nlengthening  time  horizons  and  reducing  the  cost  of  borrowing.  Interest  rates  declined \nsignificantly during 2001\u20132003. Since 2004, inflation has picked up again and its outlook is less \nstable. This had a negative impact on the market for government bonds, particularly in 2005. \nThe impact of higher and more volatile inflation and rising interest rates on the corporate bond \nmarket was mitigated by increasingly using floating rates for newly issued corporate bonds. \n23.  Domestic institutional investors such as mutual funds or insurance companies have \nemerged as a relatively new force in the financial sector. The mutual funds subsector remains \nsmall relative to other countries in the region. Individual investors account for the bulk of \nexchange trading. However, in 2005, total assets of mutual funds amounted to $2.3 billion. As \nsuch, they are a relevant player. Equity funds now account for 85% of total assets under \nmanagement of mutual funds. In contrast, most assets of insurance companies are invested in \ngovernment  bonds,  only  16%  in  equity.  Investment  of  the  Central  Directorate  of  National \nSavings and the Old Age Benefits Institution is also concentrated in government securities. \n24.  The investor base of Pakistan issuers of securities is not restricted to domestic investors. \nForeign portfolio investment rose to $334 million during FY2006, up from an aggregate inflow of \n$202 million over the preceding 3 years. The increasing inflow of portfolio investment is in line \nwith international and regional trends. One underlying factor is the explosion of resources \nmobilized by dedicated emerging market funds. Another is that controls on foreign investment in \nshares and bonds have been substantially loosened. Pakistani companies can also raise capital \ninternationally. Two Pakistani companies have taken this step so far by listing on the London \nStock Exchange in late-2006.  \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n1.  Government Strategy \n25.  Pakistan does not yet have an integrated financial sector development strategy, though \nSBP is currently drafting one. Key planning documents such as the Government\u2019s Medium-\n ", "6     \n   \nTerm Development Framework for 2005\u20132010,3 however, list private sector growth, capital \nmarket development, and private participation in infrastructure (which requires long-term debt \nfinancing through bonds) as important goals. These goals are likely to be achieved as the \nGovernment  remains  committed  to  a  next  generation  reform  agenda  in  banking  (further \nconsolidation,  introduction  of  risk-based  supervision)  and  capital  markets  (adding  depth  to \nmarket development).  \n26.  Following successful banking reforms, the Government intends to accelerate capital \nmarket reforms to turn corporate securities into a relevant source for long-term finance and \nensure a balanced development of the financial sector. Besides deepening capital markets and \nintroducing  new  financing  instruments,  the  Government  is  keen  to  promote  new  savings \ninstruments, in particular pension products, to increase low domestic savings\u2014a key constraint \nto mobilizing financial resources for higher investment. The Government also aims to strengthen \nthe  institutional  framework  for  sector  governance  by  establishing  a  financial  services \ncommission for the regulation and supervision of NBFIs and services. \n2.   Issues and Opportunities \n27.  Key issues, constraints, and opportunities facing the development of capital markets in \nPakistan include (i) weak enabling environment for nonbank financial companies4, (ii) lack of a \nregulatory  framework  for  private  pension  funds,  (iii)  policy  and  regulatory  constraints  for \ncorporate  bond  issues,  (iv)  high  equity  market  volatility  and  small  public  float,  (v)  weak \ninstitutional framework for capital market regulation and supervision, (vi) difficulties supervising \nfinancial groups, (vii) weak securities market legislation, and (viii) market fragmentation. \n28.  Figure  1  provides  a  schematic  illustration  of  these  issues  and  constraints  for  the \ndeveloping institutional investors, increasing the supply of securities, and establishing a sound \nframework for sector governance and investor protection.  \na.  Underdevelopment of Institutional Investors Constrains Long-Term \nCapital Formation and Demand for Securities \n29.  While lack of suitable assets, including corporate equity and debt (bonds), has clearly \nhampered  the  development  of  institutional  investors,  the  relative  underdevelopment  of \ncontractual savings inhibits, in turn, the development of equity and bond markets. Studies \nelsewhere show a particularly strong causal relationship between the level of development of \nfunded private pension schemes and life insurance, and the deepening of the capital market. \n \n30.  Weak Enabling Environment for Nonbank Financial Companies. The legal status of \nnonbank financial companies, including important classes of institutional investors such as \nmutual funds, investment banks, and others, is recognized in the 1984 Companies Ordinance. \nHowever, the Companies Ordinance does not provide a legal mandate for SECP for licensing, \nprudential regulation, and supervision of such companies. This is a serious constraint for the \nsound development of nonbank financial companies, since it limiting the scope for establishing \nand enforcing a sound regulatory framework. Typically, regulation and supervision of such \ncompanies would be covered under a substantive law such as exists in Pakistan for securities \nmarkets and the insurance industry. \n                                                 \n3  Planning Commission. 2005.

Nonbank financial companies are, as \nsuch, a subgroup of nonbank financial institutions.

Mutual funds are the single most important type of institutional investors in Pakistan. The \nstate-owned National Investment Trust (NIT) is by far the largest mutual fund, with assets of \n$1.4 billion under management, equivalent to 37% of total assets of the mutual fund industry (as \nof April 2007). NIT\u2019s dominating market position and implicit credit guarantee as a state-owned \ncompany constrain the development of private sector mutual funds by distorting competition. \n \n32.  Lack  of  Regulatory  Framework  for  Private  Pension  Funds.  The  introduction  of \nprivate pension schemes could have a significant positive impact on the development of equity \nand  bond  markets,  and  vice  versa.  However,  this  requires  such  schemes  to  be  properly \nregulated to protect the pension savings of individuals. In Pakistan, a regulatory framework for \nvoluntary contribution-funded private pension schemes has yet to be established. The same \napplies to employer-sponsored pension arrangements, for which SECP is assigned authority (as \nfor other private pension products). However, these schemes currently have no direct oversight \nor supervision other than by tax authorities. This constitutes a regulatory gap that is potentially \ndangerous as it leaves participants unprotected. \n \nb.   Underdeveloped Market for Corporate Securities Limits Securities \nSupply  \n33.  As in many other countries, Pakistan\u2019s financial sector is dominated by banks. However, \nunlike most other countries, bank dominance has increased over the last 5 years (para. 7). \nOverreliance on the limited range of banking services and products is not only a constraint for \nsavings mobilization and investment finance, it also poses considerable risks to the stability of \nthe financial sector and the economy in total as experienced during the Asian financial crisis. \n \n34.  Regulatory and Policy Constraints on Corporate Bond Issues. Corporate bonds are \nnormally priced at a premium over a risk-free rate of return (yield) on government bonds or other \nbenchmark debt instrument with comparable maturity. The Government issues a considerable \nvolume of debt instruments. However, these instruments are mostly not tradable (tradable \ngovernment  securities  such  as  PIBs  or  treasury  bills  together  accounted  for  only  32%  of \noutstanding debt in June 2006). Further, the terms of tradable government securities, including \nmaturity periods, and the volume of issues vary considerably. Both factors have undermined \nefforts to build a government benchmark yield curve. Consequently, the pricing of corporate \nbonds is very difficult, which in turn clearly impedes corporate bond market development. \n \n35.  The 1899 Stamp Duty Act gives provincial authorities the right to levy a stamp duty on \nterm finance certificates, i.e., corporate bonds. Until 2005, the rate was uniformly 0.15% of the \nissued volume or Rs1,000,000 ($17,000 equivalent), whichever is lower. In the Province of the \nPunjab this rate was reduced to 0.05% through the 2006 budget act. However, the Government \nof Punjab decided to levy the duty annually rather than just once. This means the rate is higher \nnow for bonds with a maturity longer than 2 years. The Sindh Provincial Government only \nmarginally reduced the duty for secondary issues. The Islamabad Capital Territory has not \nchanged the original rates from 0.15%. \n \n36.  Stamp duties are a serious policy distortion that undermines the Government\u2019s objective \nto  achieve  balanced  development  of  the  financial  sector.  The  duties  increase  the  cost  of \ncorporate bond issues and lower their competitiveness as compared with bank loans, which are \nnot taxed. This is a key reason why the average amount of public corporate bond issues has \nbeen at around $20 million for years, which appears very high as compared with the size of \ntypical investment projects in the country. Smaller volumes are not competitive financially due to ", "    9 \n   \nthe  stamp  duty  (and  other  regulatory  constraints  that  increase  the  cost  of  issuing  bonds; \nparas.37\u201338). Further, annual levies clearly act as a disincentive for the issuance of long-term \nbonds.  This  significantly  undermines  the  Government\u2019s  objective  to  attract  private  sector \nparticipation  in  infrastructure,  where  long-term  debt  finance  (through  bonds)  is  particularly \nimportant. From a fiscal revenue perspective, stamp duties on corporate bonds are insignificant, \ngiven the small number of bonds issued (only six public bond issues in FY2006, for instance). \n \n37.  SECP has not authorized trading in publicly offered corporate bonds outside the stock \nexchanges. Instead, corporate bonds are required to be listed and traded within an electronic \ntrading system established at the exchanges. This constrains bond market development, since it \nincreases the cost of issuing bonds (in the form of listing and rating fees) without generating \nbenefits. As debt instruments, corporate bonds are typically bought by institutional investors \nrather than retail investors. Further, even in mature financial markets, bonds are typically held \nuntil maturity and traded only infrequently (normally by phone through an informal over-the-\ncounter market). Therefore, forcing corporate bonds into listing and trading on a formal trading \nplatform, essentially designed for a listed share market with a large order flow from retail \ninvestors, makes little sense. \n \n38.  Issuing corporate bonds involves cost in the form of registration fees and other charges \nthat may be levied by the regulatory body. Further, the registration process takes time. The \nregulatory framework for bond issues should strike a balance between the public interest of \ninvestor protection, which is the key justification for regulation, and the need to make bonds a \ncompetitive instrument for investment finance. \u201cShelf-registration\u201d5 of bonds (and equity), which \nhelps to strike this balance, has been international practice for many years. However, securities \nmarket  regulation  in  Pakistan  does  not  support  the  concept  of  shelf  registration.  This \nsignificantly reduces the competitiveness of bonds as a means of investment finance. \n \n39.  High interest payments for instruments offered by the Government\u2019s National Savings \nScheme (NSS), which is administered by the Central Directorate of National Savings, hindered \nbond market development for years. As a step toward addressing the problem, the authorities \nintroduced a formula linking interest on NSS instruments to yields on PIBs. However, NSS \ninstruments  still  appear  attractive  since  their  pricing  fails  to  take  into  account  that  NSS \ninstruments  can  be  redeemed  any  time  without  redemption  charges,  whereas  selling \ninstruments with comparable yields involves such charges and/or other costs. Further, another \nstep taken (in March 2000) to provide equal opportunities for corporate bonds was a ban on \ninstitutional investment in NSS instruments. This ban helped to increase the number of public \ncorporate  bond  issues  significantly.  However,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  reversed  this \ndecision in late 2006 so that institutional investors are able to invest in NSS instruments again.  \n \n40.  Overall, given the large total volume of NSS instruments (which account for 41% of \ngovernment debt) and their pricing, institutional investment in NSS instruments crowds out long-\nterm investment in corporate bonds. Further, issuing a large percentage of government debt in \nthe form of NSS bonds undermines the Government\u2019s efforts to build a benchmark yield curve \nfor corporate debt by establishing a liquid market for treasury bills and PIBs. \n \n41.  High Equity Market Volatility and Small Public Float. The Pakistan stock market is \nhighly volatile. This is partly due to a high volume of speculative short-term individual investment \nin shares. Following the increase of the capital value tax on all stock market transactions at the \n                                                 \n5  It allows the issuer to go through the full registration process for a new issue once, and offer additional volumes of \nthe security (with the same terms) over a specified period of time, as needed and when market conditions allow, \nwithout being exposed to the same (costly and time-consuming) registration process. \n ", "10    \n   \nend of 2006, trading volumes reportedly dropped by about 30%. The capital value tax affects all \ntransactions: whether profitable or loss-making, short-term speculative or long-term oriented, or \nundertaken by retail or institutional investments. However, it is comparatively easy to levy and \nadminister. A capital gains tax is in place, but income from investment in shares is exempt. \n \n42.  Another factor explaining high stock market volatility is the thin public float (shares \navailable for trading) of the largest listed companies. This is mainly the result of the existing \nprivatization policy that foresees an initial public offering (IPO) of only a limited number of SOE \nshares, usually 5%\u201310% of the total, to establish a market price. This market price can then be \ntaken as a reference point for subsequent sales of larger share packages to strategic investors.  \n \n43.  However, in many cases, the subsequent privatization to a strategic investor occurs with \na substantial delay, if at all. This is primarily due to increasing public opposition against this \napproach,  which  is  perceived  as  not  sufficiently  transparent  and,  consequently  prone  to \ncorruption and often subject to public interest litigation.6 In fact, while the current approach to \nprivatization though an IPO and subsequent sale to a strategic investor may have merits with \nregard to some SOEs, it fails to acknowledge that well-prepared, sequenced sales of blocks of \nSOE shares to the public can increase the transparency of privatization, strengthen governance \nand performance of SOEs, and maximize the returns of the sales of state assets over the \nmedium and long term. The present approach also fails to take into account its negative impact \non market liquidity and volatility, and thus capital market development. While many IPOs of \nSOEs seem to be undertaken professionally, they are deal-driven and not embedded in a well-\ndesigned overall privatization strategy. \n \nc.  Weak  Capital  Market  Governance  Results  in  Poor  Market \nTransparency and Weak Investor Protection \n44.  Weak Institutional Framework for Regulation and Supervision. SECP has, over \ntime, been assigned responsibility for the regulation and supervision of the securities market \nand most categories of NBFIs. However, a number of weaknesses in the structural and legal \nframework affect effective prudential or market conduct regulation by the SECP. The overall \nenabling legislation, especially the 1997 SECP law, does not provide adequate independence \nand accountability required for SECP to effectively instill and oversee implementation of good \ngovernance for the large part of the financial sector for which it is in charge. More specifically, \nSECP\u2019s institutional independence is undermined by inadequate terms for the appointment and \ndismissal of senior personnel. Further, SECP\u2019s governance structure mixes executive powers \nwith responsibilities for policy making, and fails to assign responsibility for key aspects such as \naccounting, law, and policy making to distinct senior officials. Furthermore, SECP\u2019s supervisory \nindependence, i.e., its ability to exercise its judgment and powers in such matters as licensing, \ninspections,  sanctioning,  and  enforcement  of  sanctions  is  undermined  by  insufficient  legal \nprotection for its staff in the performance of their duties.  \n45.  With regard to proper accountability, without which independence cannot be effective, \nSECP primarily reports to MOF. This arrangement brings SECP under the direct control of the \nGovernment and undermines its independence, which is clearly inferior to one that creates a \nnetwork  of  complementary  and  overlapping  checking  mechanisms  through  the  executive, \nlegislative, and judicial branches of government, and the industry and public at large. Such a \nframework  would  ensure  that  none  of  these  stakeholders  control  SECP  entirely  (and \nundermines its independence), but SECP is nonetheless under public control.     \n                                                 \n6  An example would be the 2006 Supreme Court ruling against the (strategic) privatization of Pakistan Steel Mill.  ", "    11 \n   \n46.  Nontransparent Financial Groups. Holding companies are permitted under the 1984 \nCompanies Ordinance. However, the actual formation of holding companies is impeded by tax \npolicy distortions that can result in double taxation of corporate income of affiliated companies \nwithin a holding company.7 This is the main reason why only few of the approximately 60 groups \nof companies in Pakistan were established under a holding company. This is not only negative \nfor the competitiveness of these groups, but also for financial sector regulation and supervision. \nSECP and SBP find it often difficult, if not impossible, to discern the actual owners of financial \nentities in a complex financial group; monitor transactions between financial institutions within \nthe  group;  and  enforce  laws  and  regulations,  including  prudential  requirements.  This \nsignificantly increases systemic risks in the financial sector. \n47.  The structuring of groups that include banks and NBFIs under a holding company would \nallow  these  groups  to  attain  the  benefits  of  a  diversified  financial  services  provider  while \nstrengthening the ability of the group to engage in sound risk management practices. Further, it \nwould enable the regulatory body to require that prudential standards be calibrated with the risk \nof  undertaking  diversified  financial  business,  and  that  financial  and  operating  reporting \nrequirements be in line with international best practices for all types of financial institutions \nincluded in the group. This is especially important in an emerging financial services environment \nwhere risk management skills and supervision capacity are relatively weak.  \n48.  Weak  Securities  Market  Legislation.  The  1969  Securities  Ordinance  has  been \nfrequently amended over time, but is still outdated in some major areas. Among its many \nweaknesses, it fails to provide SECP with sufficient investigative and enforcement powers (not \naddressed by the 1997 SECP Law) and lacks provisions governing important areas and aspects \nof  modern  securities  markets,  such  as  collective  investment  schemes  or  various  levels  of \ncommitments for underwriting securities (\u201cbest efforts\u201d). \n49.  Currently securities market regulation requires investment banks and brokers (or such \ndivisions in commercial banks) to firmly commit to underwrite issues of securities they want to \nbring to the market for their clients. That means they guarantee to purchase by themselves the \namount that cannot be placed with other investors, despite their \u201cbest efforts\u201d to achieve this. \nThis harbors significant risks to investment banks and brokers, particularly in the case of an \nIPO, which entails the sale of securities for which a market price is not available. Underwriters, \ntherefore, tend to underprice IPOs, which lowers proceeds to the issuer. As a result, companies \nare very reluctant to raise capital through a stock exchange listing. \n50.  Further, the 1969 Securities Ordinance does not clearly define the concepts of private \nplacement and public offers, and focuses on the regulation and supervision of stock exchanges \nand listed companies rather than public companies and public securities (whether or not they \nare listed). SECP\u2019s legal powers over unlisted public companies and issues are, therefore, very \nlimited. Even the corporate governance and disclosure standards for listed companies flow out \nof (voluntary) listing standards established by stock exchanges rather than the Securities Law. \nThe law does not, as such, achieve a key objective of securities market legislation, i.e., to \nprovide an adequate legal basis for investor protection, and thereby facilitate capital formation. \n51.  Uneven corporate governance and disclosure requirements for listed and unlisted public \ncompanies create regulatory arbitrage and disincentives for listing, which undermines investor \nprotection. In Pakistan unlisted public companies can enjoy the benefits of being public (in the \nform  of  a  broader  investor  base),  while  avoiding  the  stricter  corporate  governance  and \n                                                 \n7  A detailed analysis of these tax distortions is in the Draft Report of the Task Force on Review of Tax Laws of \nHolding Companies, which was established by the Central Board of Revenue in August 2006, and comprises the \nCentral Board of Revenue, SECP, and Pakistan Business Council.       \n ", "12    \n   \ndisclosure standards that are normally required from public companies to protect investors. This \nis an important reason why the stock exchanges have not attracted more issuers in the past and \nlost a significant number of public companies though delisting. \n52.  Untested Competence of Professional Market Participants. A growing retail investor \nbase will require quality investor support services and better market information. At present, no \nmechanism is in place to increase professional standards and qualification of stock brokers, \nmutual  fund  sales  agents,  or  compliance  officers.  If  appropriate  training  and  certification \nprograms were implemented, this would enhance professionalism in the securities markets and \nimprove investor protection. In other jurisdictions, such training is normally provided by a private \ntraining  institute  or  a  self-regulatory  organization.  The  actual  tests  for  competence  are \nadministered by the securities market regulator or a self-regulatory organization, which is best \npractice  in  many  countries.  With  the  expected  privatization  of  NIT-managed  funds,  the \nstrengthening of the regulatory framework and establishment of a training and certification \nprogram for securities market professionals and other NBFI agents and intermediaries become \nespecially important. \n53.  Market Fragmentation. Although the vast majority of listed securities are traded on \nmore than one exchange in Pakistan, the market remains fragmented, which undermines its \nefficiency, particularly with regard to price discovery and investor confidence. This is mainly due \nto weak linkages between the exchanges. The three exchanges do not have any systematic \nexchange of price and other information. Self-regulation of the exchanges is weak, and no \nmechanism is in place to coordinate intermarket surveillance and development of a plan for \nsharing self-regulatory responsibilities. Brokers are not required to execute orders of their clients \nin  the  best  interests  of  the  latter  in  a  fair  and  transparent  manner.  Due  to  lack  of  price \ninformation from other exchanges, brokers are often not in the position to avail of quotations \nfrom other exchanges. Options for strengthening investor protection and efficiency of the market \nby  addressing  its  fragmentation  and  increasing  transparency  include  (i)  merge  the  three \nexchanges, or (ii) strengthen linkages between exchanges to achieve a unified national market \nsystem in securities, which would consist of several exchanges. The second is more realistic \nunder the present circumstances. \n \n3.  External Assistance  \n54.  ADB has been supporting financial sector development in Pakistan since 1995 when the \nFinancial Sector Intermediation Loan was approved.8 While this loan included a small capital \nmarket component (it focused on banking), only the Capital Market Development Program \n(CMDP),9  approved  in  1997  together  with  a  TA  loan  for  capacity  building,10  initiated \ncomprehensive capital market reforms.   \n55.  The CMDP was broad based and touched on all integral components of the capital \nmarket. According to its performance audit report, the CMDP was successfully implemented and \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 1995.

Manila (Loan 1577-PAK[SF], approved on 6 November, for $5 million).   ", "    13 \n   \nproduced  concrete  results.11  These  include  (i)  establishing  SECP;  (ii)  modernizing  the \ninfrastructure of stock exchanges; (iii) fully operationalizing automated trading and the central \ndepositary systems; (iv) establishing a national clearing and settlement system; (v) liberalizing \nmutual fund investment policies and harmonizing taxation of private and state-owned mutual \nfunds; (vi) disallowing institutional investment in NSS instruments to support corporate bond \nmarket development; and (vii) establishing basic regulatory frameworks for insurance, leasing, \nand asset-backed securities. \n56.  Building on the CMDP agenda, ADB approved the Financial (Nonbank) Markets and \nGovernance Program (FMGP) in 2002.12 The FMGP consisted of a program loan, a political risk \nguarantee facility, and two TA loans aimed at (i) strengthening pension, insurance, and savings \nsystems; and (ii) strengthening regulation, enforcement, and governance of nonbank financial \nmarkets. Key achievements of the FMGP include (i) SECP capacity building for on-site and off-\nsite inspections, (ii) establishment of regulatory frameworks for money markets and futures, \n(iii) strengthened disclosure and governance requirements for listed companies and NBFIs, \n(iv) establishment of professional standards for accountants and auditors, (v) establishment of \nan enabling environment for demutualization of stock exchanges, (vi) harmonization of tax \ntreatment of government and corporate bonds, and (vii) floatation of 10 SOEs through the stock \nexchange. However, the FMGP had a number of complex amendments to financial sector laws, \ncovering an array of issues in various subsectors. The legal process has been considerably \ndelayed  and  not  reached  a  closure  to  date.  Further,  the  financial  sector  has  changed \nsignificantly since FMGP\u2019s approval in 2002, which has necessitated a reprioritization of the \nsector reform agenda. The Government, therefore, proposed that (i) certain aspects of the \nreform measures under the FMGP (particularly those relating to capital market development) be \npursued and strengthened under the proposed Program, and (ii) other aspects of the reform \nmeasures under the FMGP (such as those relating to insurance and corporate governance) be \ncarried  out  more  comprehensively  over  the  course  of  2008-2010  through  more  focused \ninterventions such as a contractual savings reform program and an export competitiveness \ndevelopment program. Pursuant to this and a request from the Government to cancel the \nremaining amount under the second tranche of the FMGP following release of the incentive \ntranche in September 2005, ADB canceled the pending tranche of $80 million in May 2007.  \n \n57.  The proposed Program will support a second generation of capital market reforms, \nbuilding on the key achievements under the CMDP and FMGP. Table A3.1 in Appendix 3 sets \nout the policy areas under the FMGP that will be carried forward under the proposed Program. \nFigure A3  outlines how the achievements of previous  ADB-supported interventions will be \nsustained through the proposed Program. \n58.  ADB\u2019s support complements that of other external funding agencies, with whom ADB \nhas coordinated closely throughout. ADB\u2019s 1995 Financial Sector Intermediation Loan shared \nthe same purpose, scope, and policy requirements with the World Bank\u2019s Financial Sector \nDeepening  and  Intermediation  Project,  which  was  approved  in  1994.  Subsequently,  ADB \nembarked into capital market development support, while the World Bank has been focusing on \nbanking reforms.13 The World Bank approved the Banking Sector Adjustment Loan (for $250 \nmillion) in 1997, followed by the Banking Sector Restructuring and Privatization Project (for \n                                                 \n11  ADB. 2006.

The International \nFinance Corporation has undertaken debt and equity investments in a number of financial \ninstitutions, including Tameer Microfinance Bank (2005), International Housing Finance Limited \n(2005), and Habib Bank Limited (2006). It has also participated in establishing a mutual fund, \nABAMCO Composite Fund (2004), and a private equity fund, Jahangir Siddiqui Private Equity \nFund I (2005). \n4.   Lessons \n59.  Relevant lessons from ADB\u2019s experience with program lending in general, and with \nfinancial sector development in particular, have been incorporated in the design of the proposed \nProgram. An important lesson is that policy actions requiring comprehensive legal reforms can \nhamper program implementation, notwithstanding a government\u2019s strong support for a program. \nUnder the FMGP, the Government was required to draft or amend a total of nine laws.14 This \nwas  partly  the  response  to  a  previous  neglect  of  legal  reforms.  However,  while  strong \ncommitment of the Government\u2019s executive branch for legal reforms under the FMGP was \nhelpful  in  maintaining  implementing  agencies  and  the  Parliament  focused  on  proposed \nlegislation, this could not ensure the timely preparation of all recommended pieces of legislation \nand their subsequent passage by the legislature. The laws covered complex technical issues, \ndealt with a range of vested interests and required extensive stakeholder consultations. The \nproposed Program will focus on just two key pieces of legislation, namely a new securities law \nand a law that codifies a consolidated nonbank financial regulatory agency. Further, TA will be \nprovided  to  ensure  that  the  draft  laws  comply  with  international  standards,  and  provide \nassistance, as needed, throughout the legislative deliberation process. \n60.  Further, effective implementation of development initiatives requires strong Government \nownership.  Although  political  disruptions  delayed  CMDP  implementation  in  difficult \nmacroeconomic circumstances, strong commitment of MOF as the executing agency and solid \nsupport  from  SECP  as  the  implementing  agency  prevented  the  CMDP  from  derailing  and \nenabled  its  successful  completion.  Many  problems  that  could  not  be  foreseen  at  program \nformulation  were  thus  resolved  through  concerted  efforts  of  the  officials  concerned.15  The \nproposed Program generates the required Government ownership by taking into account the \nreform proposals formulated under a number of stakeholder initiatives that are, among others, \nsponsored  by  MOF  and  SECP.  This  particularly  relates  to  corporate  securities  market \ndevelopment and tax reforms. Further, while the new Securities Law and the Financial Services \nCommission  of  Pakistan  (FSCP)  law  were  drafted  with  ADB  support  in  2005,  they  have \nsubsequently been comprehensively adjusted by SECP staff to fit national conditions and are \nnow fully owned by SECP. \n61.  Furthermore, financial sector development takes place over time and require a series of \ninterventions in any environment. Financial market development in general, and prudential and \nmarket conduct regulation in particular, have taken decades of reforms even in advanced \ncountries. Governance of financial market intermediaries is constantly evolving in many parts of \n                                                 \n14  This includes (i) amending the 1984 Companies Ordinance or drafting and enacting a new company law, \n(ii) amending the 1888 Trust Act, (iii) replacing the 1997 SECP Act 1997 with a new law, (iv) replacing the 1969 \nSecurities and Exchange Ordinance with a new law, (v) amending the 1997 Central Depository Act, (vi) drafting \nand enacting a corporate rehabilitation act (bankruptcy law), (vii) enacting legislation on demutualization of \nexchanges, (viii) drafting and enacting the Anti-Money Laundering Act, and (ix) amending the 2000 Insurance \nOrdinance.   \n15  ADB. 2002. Program Completion Report on the Capital Market Development Program (Loan 1576-PAK) and \nCapacity Building of the Securities Market (TA Loan 1577-PAK) in Pakistan. Manila. ", "    15 \n   \nthe world. As such, financial sector reforms in developing countries such as Pakistan require \nlong-term commitment by development partners for continuous support to introduce and enforce \ndifficult and costly changes. A multitude of supportive policy, legal, regulatory, and institutional \nframeworks have to be established gradually over time in several rounds of reforms. Every new \nround has to advance the unfinished agenda while making necessary adjustments to past \nreforms to conform to changing economic and political developments. The CMDP successfully \nbuilt on the Financial Sector Intermediation Loan. The FMGP helped to address the unfinished \nagenda  of  the  CMDP.  Building  on  achievements  made  under  the  CMDP  and  FMGP,  the \nproposed Program will support a second round of comprehensive reforms in capital markets. \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n62.  The impact of the Program will be enhanced economic growth through a more efficient \nand  better  balanced  financial  system.  The  Program\u2019s  outcome  will  be  increased  resource \nmobilization through the capital market for productive investment and employment generation \nby  providing  efficient  savings  vehicles  for  retail  and  institutional  investors  and  diversifying \nfunding sources for enterprises. This diversification will also make the corporate and financial \nsector more resilient to shocks. More specifically, the Program will (i) support the development \nof institutional investors to facilitate long-term capital formation and increase the demand for \nsecurities, (ii) improve the efficiency of securities markets to increase the supply of corporate \nsecurities and optimize the allocation of financial resources into productive investment, and \n(iii) strengthen capital market governance to improve market transparency and protect investors.  \n63.  To achieve its objectives, the Program will (i) strengthen the enabling environment for \nprivate  pension  funds  and  other  institutional  investors;  (ii)  address  policy  and  regulatory \nconstraints to the development of corporate bond markets; (iii) increase equity market breadth \nand reduce its volatility; (vi) strengthen the institutional framework for sector supervision by \ntransforming  SECP  into  the  Financial  Services  Commission  of  Pakistan  (FSCP)  for  the \nregulation and supervision of NBFIs; and (v) strengthen the governance of securities markets, \nmarket professionals, and public issuers. \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions \n64.  The policy actions supported under the Program build on (i) international capital market \ndevelopment  experience;  (ii)  international  best  practice  in  securities  market  regulation  and \nsupervision as reflected in the objectives and principles of the International Organization of \nSecurities Commissions; (iii) ongoing or planned policy, legal, and regulatory reform initiatives of \nthe  Government;  and  (iv)  proposals  formulated  under  a  number  of  stakeholder  initiatives, \nincluding (a) the Working Group on Debt Market and Commercial Paper, (b) the Debt Capital \nMarket Committee, (c) the Task Force on Review of Tax Laws of Holding Companies, and \n(d) an ongoing private sector initiative to establish the Securities Institute of Pakistan (SIP). The \ndevelopment policy letter and policy matrix for the Program are in Appendix 4. A program of this \nnature  requires  sound  macroeconomic  underpinning.  On  ADB\u2019s  request,  the  International \nMonetary Fund has provided a summary assessment of recent macroeconomic developments, \nwhich is presented in Appendix 5. \n ", "16    \n   \n1.  Support the Development of Institutional Investors to Facilitate Long-Term \nCapital Formation \na.  Establish an Enabling Environment for Private Pension Funds \n65.  Under the Program, SECP is to (i) establish a regulatory framework, including prudential \nstandards and implementation guidelines, for a voluntary private pension scheme (VPS), and \n(ii) authorize  qualified  financial  companies  to  offer  VPS  to  their  clients.  The  regulatory \nframework will ensure investor protection. Further, the Government is to broaden the base of \neligible VPS participants to individuals beyond those with a national tax number (estimated at \n1.6 million) to enhance the outreach of the VPS. Making all national identity cardholders eligible, \nfor instance, could help to include individuals working outside the country (estimated at 6 \nmillion) or in areas that are tax exempt such as agriculture. Broadening the base of the VPS is \nnot only desirable from a social protection point of view; it would also significantly increase \ncapital mobilization and the business viability of the VPS. \n66.  Based on a review (with ADB TA) of existing employer-sponsored occupational pension \nschemes, SECP will issue best practice guidelines for such schemes under the Program. In \ndoing so, SECP will benefit from its experience in establishing the VPS framework.  \n67.  To expand the range of shares for investment by private pension funds, the Government \nis to offer SOE shares in the form of block sales to private pension funds, as is current practice \nwith  other  institutional  investors.  Making  SOE  shares,  which  are  typically  oversubscribed, \navailable for pension funds will provide additional incentives to the population for embarking into \nlong-term contractual saving through participation in private pension schemes, and help to \nreduce market volatility by facilitating long-term institutional investment in shares. \nb.  Support the Development of Domestic Institutional Investors \n68.  Under the Program, the Government is to clarify SECP\u2019s legal mandate for its powers, \nfunctions, and responsibilities over nonbank financial companies and their services. As an \nintermediate solution, the Government will make amendments to the Company Ordinance to \nempower SECP to regulate mutual funds and strengthen SECP\u2019s powers to establish prudential \nrequirements for nonbank financial companies. Subsequently, SECP will be able to actually \nstrengthen  prudential  requirements  by  amending  the  2005  rules  for  nonbank  financial \ncompanies. Amendments have already been drafted and discussed with the industry. \n69.  Further under the Program, the Government will draft (with ADB TA) and submit to \nParliament a distinct nonbank financial companies law. Provisions for mutual funds could be \nincluded in this law or, alternatively, in the Securities Law, given their importance for securities \nmarkets. Providing a solid legal foundation for the regulation and supervision of mutual funds is \nparticularly important given the planned privatization of NIT, which will substantially increase the \nassets managed by private mutual funds. NIT privatization is an important objective of the \nGovernment under the Program, since it will  significantly accelerate competition in the mutual \nfund industry. ", "    17 \n   \n2.  Improve the Efficiency of Securities Markets to Optimize the Allocation of \nFinancial Resources \na.  Facilitate the Development of Corporate Bond Markets \n70.  SECP established the Working Group on Debt Market and Commercial Paper in March \n2005  and  the  Debt  Capital  Market  Committee  in  June  2006,  both  with  broad  stakeholder \nparticipation.  The  objective  of  these  initiatives  was  to  identify  bond  market  development \nconstraints and formulate proposals to address them. Under the Program the Government is to \ndisseminate the report of the Debt Capital Market Committee, which includes key proposals \nmade by the Working Group on Debt Market and Commercial Paper. This will help to build \nbroad-based consensus about needed reforms. Subsequently, the Government is to implement \nkey proposals formulated by these stakeholder initiatives (paras. 71\u201376). \n71.  MOF and SBP are to build a benchmark yield curve for corporate bonds to include yields \nof treasury bills and PIBs by standardizing their terms and issuing them at regular intervals. The \namounts and maturities should be determined by market conditions and the Government\u2019s debt \nmanagement policy. The liquidity of the yield-curve should be enhanced over time by increasing \nthe amounts of individual issues. \n72.  The Government is also recommended to work with provincial authorities to reduce the \ncost of issuing corporate securities by lowering the stamp duties for corporate bonds. This will \nreduce (or even eliminate, if the duty is reduced to zero) a policy distortion that discriminates \ncorporate bonds against bank credits. Lowering stamp duties on corporate bonds will tend to \nincrease the number of corporate bond issues and lengthen their maturity. This will have a \nsignificant positive impact on economic development in general and private-sector-financed \ninfrastructure development in particular. \n73.  SECP is to abolish the regulatory requirement for public corporate bond issues to be \nlisted on a stock exchange. Abolishing the listing requirement reduces the cost of issuing bonds, \nand should significantly increase the number of issues. The policy action does not have any \nnegative implications: Despite the current requirement to list at the formal over-the-counter \nmarket, no corporate bonds are actually traded at this market. Abolishing the listing requirement \ndoes  not  suggest  that  greater  liquidity  of  a  secondary  market  for  corporate  bonds  is  not \ndesirable. However, greater liquidity cannot be artificially induced by policies that do not reflect \nmarket conditions and fail to acknowledge the characteristics of corporate bonds compared with \nequity: Corporate bonds normally are priced at a premium over a risk-free rate of return of \nbenchmark debt instruments with comparable maturities, while share prices are determined \nprimarily by company-specific information.  \n74.  Further, SECP is to introduce shelf-registration procedures for securities. Corporate \nbond issues should be allowed for registration for at least one year, during which issuers can \nobtain funds when market conditions are favorable.  \n75.  Finally, the Government is recommended to establish an enabling environment for the \ncreation of a limited secondary market among qualified institutional buyers for privately placed \ncorporate bonds. Given their lower cost of issue and regulatory requirement, the number and \ntotal volume of such private placements is estimated to be higher than those of publicly issued \nbonds.  Allowing  limited  trading  in  these  instruments  would  increase  the  amount  of  assets \navailable to institutional investors, which would reduce their dependence on investing in non-\ntradable NSS instruments. Trading should be limited to qualified institutional buyers with the \ncapacity and sophistication to assess the risks involved in investing in privately placed bonds. \n ", "18    \n   \n76.  As  a  second  step,  the  Government  is  asked  to  issue  tradable  Government  bonds \nthrough the NSS wide branch network, which will provide retail investors throughout the country \nwith  a  means  for  accumulating  long-term  savings  through  investment  in  higher-yielding \ngovernment bonds. The measure will have the additional benefit of increasing the volume of \ngovernment securities in circulation, which would, in turn, help to achieve the objective of \ndeveloping a benchmark yield curve. To provide incentives for institutional (and other) investors \nto invest into tradable instruments, the Government will ensure a lower rate of return for non-\ntradable NSS instruments as compared with that of tradable Government bonds.  \nb.  Increase Equity Market Breath and Reduce its Volatility \n77.  Under the Program, the Government is asked to continue the exemption from capital \ngains tax on income earned from individual investment in shares to facilitate long-term capital \nformation. To reduce the high volume of speculative short-term investment by individuals, the \nGovernment is to introduce a turnover tax on such investment.  \n78.  Further,  the  Government  is  asked  to  develop,  with  ADB  TA,  a  policy  for  SOE \nprivatization  through  stock  exchanges.  Such  privatization  should  take  into  account  market \nconditions and investor demand, and the need to achieve a balance between shares offered in \ninternational financial centers and shares offered domestically. The policy should be disclosed \nto the public to increase transparency. The potential benefits of a more capital market oriented \nprivatization approach include (i) higher prices for shares and, thus, higher budget revenues, \nsince  investors  will  tend  to  pay  more  for  shares  if  they  have  a  credible  expectation  that \nadditional packages will be offered in the foreseeable future up to a specified minimum total of \nshares; (ii) increased market liquidity and lower volatility through a significant increase in supply \nof shares, which should facilitate overall capital market development, (iii) improved performance \nof enterprise managers by introducing market discipline to companies even if they are still partly \nstate owned; and (iv) limiting the scope for corruption by increasing transparency of privatization \nand reducing discretion of civil servants involved. The policy will also allow the Privatization \nCommission to offer SOE shares through a book building process in line with international best \npractices to domestic institutional buyers and allow the use of shelf-registrations procedures, \nwhich will increase the efficiency of the process. \n79.  In developing a more stock-market-oriented privatization approach, the Government will \nbe assisted by ADB in taking the experience of other counties into account, specifically the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, Malaysia, and Viet Nam. \n3.  Strengthen  the  Governance  of  Capital  Markets  to  Improve  Market \nTransparency and Protect Investors \na.  Strengthen the Institutional Framework for Sector Supervision \n80.  Under the Program SECP is to be converted into the Financial Services Commission of \nPakistan (FSCP) in charge of regulation and supervision of NBFIs by clearly codifying its \npowers, functions, governance, and accountability in line with international best practices. In \nrecent years, financial sector regulatory bodies have been granted greater independence in \nmany countries to ensure that they can professionally perform their statutory functions in the \npublic  interest  and  be  largely  free  from  political  interference.  An  agency  responsible  for \nregulation and supervision of NBFIs and markets should, in general, have authority and capacity \ncomparable to that of the agency in charge of banking (and for similar reasons). ", "    19 \n   \n81.  The Government is asked to draft and submit to Parliament a law codifying the FSCP. \nThis law would establish FSCP, based on SECP, and strengthen its enforcement powers by \nenhancing its independence, governance, and accountability. The law should be a framework \nlaw that incorporates by reference to sector-specific laws (such as the laws governing securities \nmarkets  and  intermediaries,  insurance,  private  pension  funds,  and  nonbank  financial \ncompanies) FSCP\u2019s powers to administer those laws. The establishment of FSCP does not \npreclude  further  integration  of  responsibility  for  regulation  and  supervision  of  banking  and \nnonbanking financial services at a later date (for which the framework law would have to be \namended).  However,  given  the  substantive  capacity  building  needs  to  establish  a  fully \nconsolidated financial sector agency and the considerable transaction cost typically involved in \nmerging regulatory agencies with different cultures and capacity, this would be beyond the \nscope of the Program. \n82.  Given the urgency of a suitable governance arrangement for SECP, particularly for recruiting \nand  retaining  qualified  staff  and  senior  personnel,  the  Government  is  to  strengthen  SECP\u2019s \ngovernance in the short term under existing law. SECP is to move to competitive remuneration for \nsenior officers to fill all existing positions. Further, SECP is asked to designate specific positions for \ncommissioners responsible for law, and accounting and auditing, given the importance of these \nareas for effective financial sector regulation and supervision. Furthermore, another commissioner \nshould be charged with assessing the economic impact of regulatory initiatives.  \n83.  Toward the end of the Program, FSCP is recommended to undertake a self-assessment \nof compliance with international best practices in the regulation and supervision of securities \nmarkets and private pension funds. This assessment could provide the basis for formulating \nanother round of policy reforms to address remaining weaknesses, if any. \nb.  Strengthen the Governance of Securities Markets, Market \nProfessionals, and Public Issuers \ni.  Financial Groups \n84.  The  Program  recognizes  the  potential  use  of  a  holding  company  to  achieve  both \nbusiness and regulatory objectives. The Program also acknowledges the Government\u2019s initiative \nto establish a task force to review the enabling environment for holding companies with special \nemphasis on their taxation, undertake stakeholder consultations, and formulate proposals in line \nwith international best practices to facilitate the formation of holding companies. The Program \nsupports  a  sequenced  approach  to  facilitating  the  formation  of  holding  companies  and \nsubsequently  using  them  to  increase  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  financial  sector \nregulation  and  supervision.  This  will  increase  the  competitiveness  of  financial  groups  and \nreduce systemic risks in the financial sector of Pakistan.  \n85.  Under the Program, the Government is to address tax policies that impede the formation \nof holding companies, as proposed by the task force. This will encourage the establishment of \nholding companies, including financial institutions, to facilitate sound risk management practices \nand supervision. Further, SECP (FSCP) will adopt regulations on the reporting requirements of \nholding companies that own or control NBFIs. The reporting should comprise (i) ownership \nstructure and relationship of companies within the holding company group, (ii) disclosure of \nintercompany and related party transactions; and  (iii) public disclosure of audited financial \nreports in accordance with international accounting standards. \n ", "20    \n   \nii.  Securities Law \n86.  To facilitate investor protection and capital formation, the Securities Ordinance of 1969 \nneeds to be replaced with a new substantive law that provides a legal framework for modern \nsecurities markets. SECP has to be mandated with adequate legal powers and responsibilities \nfor  the  regulation  and  supervision  of  the  securities  markets  and  intermediaries,  private \nplacements, public offers of listed and unlisted securities, corporate governance practices, and \nrelated matters, in line with international best practices. \n87.  Further, the law would introduce the concept of \u201cbest efforts\u201d (para. 49) and other \nunderwriting commitment. This should substantially increase the number of IPOs. The concept \nof underwriting should be broadened to recognize that the modern capital market demands the \nflexibility to offer either firm commitment underwritings or \u201cbest efforts\u201d placements of securities. \nThe concept of \u201cbest efforts\u201d has been international best practice for many years. This concept \nsignificantly reduces the risk of investment banks in managing issues, particularly IPOs. With \n\u201cbest efforts\u201d, the pricing of IPOs in Pakistan would tend to strike a fair balance between the \ninterests of the issuer and the potential investor without being twisted by risk considerations of \nthe lead manager. Prices would tend to be higher, which should, in turn, make IPOs more \nattractive for a larger number of companies. \n88.  Furthermore, the law would introduce a class of publicly tradable companies and require \nall such companies, listed and unlisted, to comply with comparable governance and disclosure \nrequirements. This would eliminate the possibility of regulatory arbitrage and its harmful effects \nin the form of disincentives for listing and undermining investor protection. The class of publicly \ntradable  companies  would  include  all  companies  with  significant  public  shareholding  and \npotential to issue securities, i.e., those companies on which the regulation and supervision is to \nfocus. As a result of these legal (and supporting regulatory) reforms, a significant increase in the \nnumber of newly listed companies can be expected. \n89.  Further under the Program, SECP (FSCP) is to issue guidelines on obtaining information \nabout unlisted publicly tradable companies. Stock exchanges will continue to provide on their \nwebsites disclosed information of listed companies. Therefore, investors will have a better \naccess to annual reports and other disclosed information of both listed and unlisted publicly \ntradable companies, which will enhance transparency and efficiency of the capital market. \n90.  Finally, the Government is to grant SECP (FSCP) the power to approve or disapprove \naudit firms authorized to audit nonbank financial companies licensed by SECP (FSCP), listed \ncompanies, and publicly tradable companies. This will strengthen SECP\u2019s (FSCP\u2019s) capability to \nensure  quality  and  consistency  in  the  financial  information  available  to  investors  and  the \nregulator. \niii.  Securities Institute of Pakistan \n91.  The Government is to support the completion of a feasibility study for the creation of SIP, \nwhich  is  currently  being  undertaken  by  the  Center  for  International  Private  Enterprise  in \nPakistan. The study is to explore opportunities for establishing this institute as a nongovernment \ninstitution by industry associations and other private sector stakeholders. SIP would aim to \nincrease professional standards and qualifications among securities market professional. SECP \nis recommended to financially support SIP given SIP\u2019s potentially significant contribution in \nhelping to reduce violation of laws and regulations through certification of professionals, training, \nand other measures. ADB TA will also assist in building SIP capacity (para. 108). ", "    21 \n   \n92.  Further under the Program, SECP (FSCP) is also recommended to develop, together \nwith SIP, a certification system for professional market participants who have completed training \ncourses delivered by SIP. All securities brokers and mutual fund sales agents dealing with \npublic customers should ultimately be certified by examination. As a supportive measure, SECP \nis to publish for comment on its website a new code of conduct for brokers. This new code \nwould replace the existing code annexed to the Brokers and Agents Registration Rules (2001), \nand should be part of the SIP curriculum. \niv.  Governance of Stock Exchanges \n93.  The new Securities Law would grant SECP (FSCP) authority to require a unified national \nmarket system in securities that may include one or more securities exchanges and alternative \ntrading platforms. Such a national market system can be created through systematic exchange of \ninformation between various trading platforms in combination with legal and regulatory requirements \nfor brokers. The system would provide for the public exposure of customer orders for the purchase \nand sale of shares to provide maximum opportunity to achieve best execution of customer orders. \n94.  Under the Program, SECP is to enhance market transparency and best execution of \ncustomer orders by requiring the stock exchanges to establish an intermarket surveillance \ncommittee. The committee would meet regularly to coordinate stock market surveillance and \noversight of securities that are traded on more than one stock exchange and would, thus, \ninstitutionalize coordination (and potentially cooperation) between the exchanges. \n95.  Further, the stock exchanges are recommended to prepare plans for self-regulation for \nSECP (FSCP) approval. These plans would identify the functions to be performed by the \nexchanges in their capacity as self-regulatory organizations under the Securities Law, and \nclearly define subplans for areas such as listed companies, market surveillance, and on- and \noff-site inspections of professional market participants. These subplans should lead to the \nadherence to sound business practices and applicable laws and regulations, including financial \nresponsibility requirements and quality of execution of trades on behalf of customers. They \nshould also include budget estimates of the cost (and capacity) of regulatory compliance. \n96.  Toward the end of the Program, SECP (FSCP) is to conduct public consultations to \nidentify remaining anticompetitive rules and regulations that undermine the creation of a national \nmarket system.16  \nC.  Financing Plan \n97.  The Government has requested a loan of $400 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help undertake the reforms and meet the Government\u2019s financing requirements. \nThe loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate to be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such other terms and conditions as set \nforth in the draft loan agreement. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its \ndecision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n                                                 \n16  This would, for instance, comprise rules that prevent brokers of one exchange from making price information \navailable to participants of another exchange, which is a key constraint to the establishment of a transparent and \nefficient national market system. \n ", "22    \n   \n98.  The following factors were considered in determining the loan size: the importance of the \nsector for sustaining economic growth, the strength of the Program and the financial and political \ncosts  associated  with  implementing  it,  and  the  Government\u2019s  overall  development  financing \nneeds. Capital market development is a key element of the Government\u2019s reform agenda given its \nimportance for resource mobilization and intermediation, investment finance, and employment \ngeneration. The financial and political costs associated with program implementation are not \neasily quantifiable given the nature of the Program. These costs will, however, be substantial, \ngiven  the  scope  of  reforms  supported  under  the  Program,  including  (i)  tax  policy  reforms; \n(ii) comprehensive legal reforms; (iii) the need to achieve and sustain broad-based consensus on \nprivatization-related issues; (iv) step-by-step privatization through the stock exchange that may \nresult  in  lower  budget  revenues  from  privatization  in  the  short  and  medium  term,  despite \nmaximizing proceeds in the long term; and (v) comprehensive capacity building for the FSCP. The \nprivate sector will also incur substantial adjustment costs for complying with stricter regulatory \nrequirements, particularly with regard to prudential requirements, including capital requirements, \nand financial disclosure and governance requirements for NBFIs and issuers of securities. The \nGovernment\u2019s overall development needs are reflected in the Government\u2019s budget for FY2007\u2013\n2008 and its medium-term budgetary framework.17    \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Program Management \n99.  MOF will be the Executing Agency for the Program. SECP (FSCP) and the Ministry of \nPrivatization  will  be  implementing  agencies.  The  financial  management  arrangements  are \nassessed as adequate. Accumulated experience in implementing a large number of program \nloans demonstrates MOF\u2019s proven competence and capacity to effectively carry out financial \nmanagement of the Program.  \n100.  The Government will establish a program coordination unit in MOF, staffed with two or \nthree officials. ADB will closely monitor program implementation to ensure that the envisaged \noutputs are achieved.  \n2.  Implementation Period \n101.  The Program will be implemented over 2 years. It will be completed by 30 June 2009.  \n3.  Procurement and Withdrawal Procedures \n102.  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of items produced \nand procured in ADB member countries, other than the items specified in the negative list of \nineligible items (Appendix 6) and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. \nThe proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed to Pakistan as the Borrower in accordance \nwith the provisions of ADB\u2019s simplification of disbursement procedures and related requirements \nfor program loans. Loan proceeds will be disbursed for a broad range of imports on the basis of \na  certificate  provided  by  the  Government  stipulating  that  the  value  of  the  total  imports  of \nPakistan, minus its imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed \nunder other official development assistance, is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan \nexpected to be disbursed during a particular year. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of \nloan proceeds and verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n                                                 \n17  Government  of  Pakistan,  Central  Board  of  Revenues.  2006.

Anticorruption Policy and Measures \n103.  ADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Program. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB's Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and \nthe bidding documents for the Program. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection \nwith the Program will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the \nrecords and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Program. \n104.  The Program incorporates key elements of good governance and anticorruption policies \nby  increasing  transparency  of  decision  making,  improving  accountability  and  stakeholder \nrepresentation, and limiting opportunities for discretionary decision-making. The Program will \nhelp to fight corruption by (i) strengthening the independence, accountability, and transparency \nof the regulatory body in charge of securities markets; and (ii) increasing the transparency of \nSOE privatization through a capital market privatization policy.  \n \n5.  Counterpart Funds \n \n105.  The Government will ensure that the local currency funds generated by the program loan \nare used (i) first, to support the adjustment costs of reforms to be initiated and implemented \nunder the Program; and (ii) second, to finance expenditures for the Government\u2019s general \ndevelopment purposes. \n \n6.  Tranches \n106.  The loan will be released in two tranches. The first tranche of $200 million will become \navailable  following  satisfaction  of  the  first  tranche  release  conditions  and  after  loan \neffectiveness. The second tranche of $200 million will be released subject to the Government\u2019s \nsatisfaction of second tranche conditions (i.e., the bolded actions set forth in the policy matrix \n(Appendix 4); this release is expected to take place 6-18 months after first tranche release. In \naddition, the Government must complete all the actions to be monitored (listed in the policy \nmatrix) during the program period. While these actions are not conditions for the release of the \nfirst or second tranches, they are crucial steps toward achieving the program objectives. \n7.  Program Performance Monitoring and Reporting \n107.  MOF  will  (i)  establish  within  3  months  after  loan  effectiveness  and  maintain  a \nperformance evaluation system for the Program, which will include a database on the status of \npolicy  measures  and  program  indicators  based  on  the  policy  matrix;  (ii)  monitor  the \nimplementation of the Program and its impacts; and (iii) submit reports to ADB semiannually on \nprogram  implementation,  including  accomplishment  of  the  measures  set  forth  in  the \ndevelopment policy letter and policy matrix. ADB will monitor program implementation through \nregular reviews and progress reports throughout implementation. Based on these reviews, \nmodifications and improvements will be considered. To facilitate such reviews, the Government \nwill  assist  ADB  by  providing  relevant  data  and  information  in  such  detail  as  ADB  may \nreasonably request. Approximately 6 weeks before the anticipated withdrawal of the second \ntranche, ADB will undertake a review of progress made in implementing the policy reforms \nunder the Program.  \n ", "24    \n   \nV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n108.  The TA for Supporting the Second Generation of Capital Market Reform Program will \nhelp the Government implement the reforms called for under the Program. In particular, the TA \nwill focus on (i) raising professional standards among market participants by supporting the SIP, \n(ii)  strengthening  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  institutional  investors,  and  (iii) \nenhancing the strategic planning capacity of the Ministry of Privatization. \n109.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,340,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $1,000,000 on a \ngrant basis. The Government\u2019s contribution of $340,000 equivalent will cover training experts, \ntraining and workshop facilities, office accommodation, and counterpart support. Procurement of \ngoods  under  the  TA  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2006,  as \namended from time to time).  \n110.  SECP will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The Ministry of Privatization and SIP will \nbe the implementing agencies. The TA will be implemented over 2.5 years, starting in August \n2007. The TA is estimated to require 107 person-months of consulting services: 14 person-\nmonths  by  international  consultants  and  93  person-months  by  national  consultants.  All \nconsultants will be selected and engaged on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The key activities, \ncost estimates, and outline terms of reference for the TA are in Appendix 7. \nVI.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits \n111.  The  Program  will  facilitate  the  mobilization  of  financial  resources  for  productive \ninvestment and employment generation by supporting the development of corporate bond and \nequity capital markets in Pakistan. The Program will help to ensure a balanced development of \nthe financial sector, which will reduce systemic vulnerabilities in the bank-dominated financial \nsystem. Specific benefits are as follows: \n \n(i)  By  addressing  policy  and  regulatory  constraints  to  the  issues  of  corporate \nsecurities, the Program will help to significantly increase the number of corporate \nbond  and  equity  issues,  both  primary  and  secondary.  This  will  facilitate  the \nmobilization  of  financial  resources  for  long-term  private  sector  investment, \nincluding  infrastructure  investment,  which  requires  long-term  debt  finance \nthrough bonds.  \n(ii)  By strengthening the enabling environment for private pension funds and other \ninstitutional  investors,  the  Program  will  facilitate  capital  mobilization  through \ncontractual savings. This is not only beneficial with regard to increasing old age \nincome security. Pension reform is also a catalyst for increasing local institutional \ninvestment and asset diversification, resulting in improved allocation of financial \nsavings. \n(iii)  By promoting the development of corporate securities markets and institutional \ninvestors, thereby diversifying financial instruments and broadening the investor \nbase, the Program will reduce market volatility and improve the resilience of the \nfinancial and enterprise sectors to external shocks.   \n(iv)  By strengthening regulatory and market conduct governance in capital markets, \nthe  Program  will  enhance  market  efficiency  and  transparency,  and  improve \ninvestor protection. The establishment and institutional strengthening of FSCP ", "    25 \n   \nand SIP, and strengthening the self-regulatory function of stock exchanges, will \nprovide these benefits. \n(v)  By addressing tax policy constraints to the formation of holding companies that \ninclude financial institutions, the Program will increase the competitiveness of \nfinancial  groups  and  the  effectiveness  of  financial  sector  regulation  and \nsupervision in line with international best practices, which will, in turn, reduce \nsystemic risks.  \n(vi)  By supporting a more capital market-oriented privatization policy, the Program \nwill (a) help to increase budget revenues, since investors will tend to pay more \nfor shares if an individual offer is embedded in a transparent and credible overall \nprivatization strategy; (b) support capital market development by reducing market \nvolatility  through  increased  liquidity;  and  (c)  improve  the  performance  of \nenterprises by introducing market discipline to companies even if they are still \npartly state owned.  \n \nB.  Impacts \n112.  A summary poverty reduction and social strategy for the Program is in Appendix 8. The \nProgram is an integral component of ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for Pakistan18 whose \noverall objective is to reduce poverty by promoting private-sector-led economic growth. The \nProgram  supports  corporate  bond  market  development.  This  will  facilitate  the  financing  of \ninfrastructure projects, which require long-term finance in the form of bonds. Enhanced private \nsector  infrastructure  finance  supports  poverty  reduction  goals  by  helping  to  provide  the \npopulation with infrastructure services and freeing up public resources needed to provide social \nservices. Further, the Program supports the development of institutional investors. This will \nallow  low-income  groups  to  enter  into  well-regulated  and  protected  contractual  savings \nschemes. The outreach of the new contractual savings schemes, particularly the new pension \nproducts,  will  be  countrywide,  i.e.,  include  rural  areas  where  the  poor  are  concentrated. \nFurthermore, the Program helps to strengthen the governance of NBFIs and markets. This will \nincrease market transparency and improve the protection of investors against fraud, which is \nparticularly important for unsophisticated investors, including vulnerable parts of the population. \nAs such, the Program is pro-poor in its indirect impact in the short and medium term. No \ninvoluntary resettlement or impact on indigenous people is expected from implementation of the \nProgram (category C). The environmental implications of the Program were assessed, and no \nsignificant  adverse  impact  was  identified.  Both  fall  under  category  C  in  ADB\u2019s  environmental \nclassification system.  \nC.  Risks  \n113.  Macroeconomic stability is essential for financial sector development in general, and \nbond market development and contractual saving schemes in particular. Macroeconomic risks \nare mitigated by prudent fiscal and monetary policies and high expected economic growth rates. \nThe Program has to assume that Pakistan will not suffer from any adverse geopolitical changes \naffecting  its  external  and  internal  stability.  Furthermore,  the  Program  assumes  that  the \nGovernment will remain strongly committed to its second generation of capital market reform \nprogram, which is embedded in the Government\u2019s Medium-Term Development Framework for \n2005\u20132010. The presidential elections scheduled for late 2007 may result in policy changes in \nsome areas. However, economic policies are unlikely to be fundamentally changed, given the \nhigh degree of continuity in economic policy making in Pakistan over the last decade and a \nbroad consensus for economic reforms, including financial sector reform. \n                                                 \n18  ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program Update: Pakistan 2006\u20132008. Manila.  \n ", "26    \n   \n \n114.  Another risk is that draft legislation will be enacted with substantial delays and/or not in \nline  with  international  best  practice  due  to  vested  interest  and  lack  of  understanding  by \nlawmakers. To minimize this risk, legislative changes related to the Program were drafted during \nprogram preparation or will be drafted under the TA to ensure quality of the legislation. In \naddition,  TA  will  be  provided  to  support  the  Government  in  undertaking  and  sustaining \nstakeholder consultations. \n \n115.  The Program supports SECP (FSCP) in playing its primary role in instilling and overseeing \nthe  implementation  of  good  governance  practices  by  financial  institutions.  However,  good \nregulatory governance cannot be sustained without good public sector governance in general. \nThe latter includes the absence of corruption, a sound approach to competitions policies, effective \nlegal and judicial systems, and an arm\u2019s-length approach to government ownership. Successful \ncontinuation  of  the  Government\u2019s  anticorruption  and  private  sector  development  policies  is \ntherefore a critical assumption for accomplishing the Program\u2019s objectives. \n \nVII.  ASSURANCES \n \n116.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The policies adopted and actions described in the development policy letter and \ntaken prior to the date of the Loan Agreement will continue in effect for the \nduration of the Program and subsequently. \n \n(ii)  The Government will promptly adopt the other policies and take the other actions \nindicated in the Program as specified in the development policy letter and the \npolicy matrix, and ensure that such policies and actions continue in effect during \nand after the program period. \n \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n117.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$400,000,000 to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Second Generation of Capital Market \nReform  Program  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a term of 15 years, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \n      President \n \n \n \n9 July 2007 \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  27   \n   \n DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact  Increased money supply  Government economic  Assumption \nMore sustainable  (from 44% of gross  statistics and reports  \u2022  Continued \neconomic growth  domestic product [GDP] in    Government \nthrough improved  2005 to 65% in 2012)  Country reports of the  commitment to \nfinancial sector   Increased savings rate  International Monetary  financial sector \nintermediation  (from 16% of GDP in  Fund  reforms \n  FY2005 to 19% in FY2012)   \n  Risk \nIncreased financial savings \n\u2022  Endogenous or \n(from 7.5% of GDP in \nexogenous shock \nFY2005 to 12% in FY2013) \n(political and \n \neconomic) \nIncreased savings \n  \nmobilized by nonbank \nfinancial institutions (from \n0.9% in 2005 to 4% in \n2013) \nOutcome     Government economic and  Assumptions \nIncreased stock market \nA more efficient and  social statistics and reports,  \u2022  Political \ncapitalization (from 41.8% \nmore balanced financial  including Financial Sector  commitment to \nof GDP in 2005 to 60% in \nsector  Assessment of the State  undertake capital \n2009) \nBank of Pakistan  market reforms is \n \n  maintained \nIncreased volume of \nCountry reports of the  \u2022  Institutional \noutstanding corporate \nInternational Monetary  capacity to \nbonds (from 0.5% of GDP \nFund  undertake reforms \nin 2005 to 3% in 2009)   \n  exists \n  Asian Development Bank \nIncreased number of   \n(ADB) review missions \ncompanies listed at the   \nstock market (from 652 in   \n2006 to 700 in 2009)   \n   \nIncreased issuance of \nequity capital (from 12 \nissues in 2005 to 50 in \n2007\u20132009)  \n        \nIncreased issuance of \ncorporate bonds (from 10 \nissues in 2005 to 50 during \n2007\u20132009) \n \nIncreased longest available \nbond maturity (from 7 years \nin 2006 to 12 years in 2009) \n \nOutputs       \n1.

Efficiently working financial markets (especially money, foreign exchange, and capital \nmarkets) are integral parts of a vibrant financial system. While money markets provide financial \nintermediaries an avenue to borrow and lend short-term funds, foreign exchange markets are a \nkey element of the enabling environment for international trade. Capital markets provide long-\nterm finance for the corporate sector (and the government). The growth and development of \nwell-functioning capital markets, including markets for equity and long-term debt capital (bonds), \nconvey significant economic benefits. They provide efficient savings vehicles for retail and \ninstitutional  investors  that  help  to  diversify  their  financial  holdings  and  facilitate  resource \nmobilization for productive investments. Further, an increased diversity of funding sources for \ncorporations makes the corporate and financial sector more robust to shocks. \n \n2.  Pakistan has made progress with capital market reforms since 1998, when a year-long \neconomic and financial crisis culminated in a crash of the capital market. The regulatory and \ninstitutional framework for the capital market has been strengthened, the financial health of \nailing financial institutions restored, a large number of state-owned institutions privatized, and \ncompetition invigorated. In spite of this, domestic capital markets do not yet play a significant \nrole in resource mobilization. However, the basis has been laid for a second round of capital \nmarket reforms that aim at turning domestic equity and bond markets into a relevant source for \nlong-term finance. \n \nA.  Institutions and Structure \n \n3.  The capital market of Pakistan comprises three stock exchanges, National Clearing and \nSettlement System, Central Depositary Company, about 300 brokers, and two rating agencies. \nFurther, it has many nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs), including (as of June 2006) 40 \nmutual  funds;  8  investment  banks  (investment  financial  institutions),  which  also  engage  in \nbrokerage  activities;  3  venture  capital  companies;  5  development  financial  institutions;1  20 \nleasing companies; 31 moderabas, which offer shariah compliant financial services;2 3 housing \nfinance companies; and 3 discount houses. Furthermore, 54 insurance companies play an \nincreasing  role  as  institutional  investors.  The  state-owned  Central  Directorate  of  National \nSavings is the biggest institutional investor in the country, followed by State Life Insurance \nCompany and Employee\u2019s Old Age Benefits Institution. \n \n4.  Of the more than 44,000 registered companies, almost 2,800 are public, i.e., have more \nthan 50 shareholders, and more than 700 are listed at one or several stock exchanges. Only \nlisted companies can make public issues of securities. Listed debt securities must be rated. \n \n5.  All three stock exchanges are fully private and mutually owned by their members, who \nare brokers.3 However, in April 2005 the Islamabad and Lahore stock exchanges approved an \naction plan for demutualization and partial integration of their trading platforms. Karachi Stock \nExchange  also  decided  to  demutualize  but  does  not  plan  to  integrate  with  the  other  two \nexchanges. The various demutualization plans foresee establishing a ceiling for shareholding by \n                                                 \n1  All development financial institutions are foreign sponsored with the exception of the Pakistan Industrial Credit and \nInvestment Corporation.  \n2  The term modaraba implies a contract between two parties, whereby one party entrusts money to the other party to \nuse its management expertise and utilize the funds in an agreed manner. Profits of the modaraba are shared in a \npreagreed ratio and losses in the proportion of the capital invested. The majority of the modarabas are in the \nfinancial sector, although no restrictions are placed on the nature of business. \n3  Apart from individual brokers, Pakistan has a number of large brokerage houses. Investment banks also offer \nbrokerage services. ", "  Appendix 2  33 \n   \nbrokers  and  offering  shares  to  other  stakeholders,  including  banks.  The  target  date  for \ndemutualization is the end of 2007.4 Preparations are well under way. \n \n6.  Over the last 5 years, NBFIs in Pakistan have transformed rapidly through restructuring \nand improved supervision. Regulatory policies focusing on consolidating weak institutions have \nresulted  in  many  mergers  and  acquisitions.  Further,  some  companies  were  absorbed  by \ncommercial banks, others discontinued operations. As a result, the number of all types of NBFIs \ndeclined with the exception of mutual funds. Mutual funds and development financial institutions \ndominate the sector now with a combined share in total assets of 41% (Figure A2.1). Insurance \ncompanies account for about 34% of NBFI assets.  \n \nFigure A1.1: Relative Size of Nonbank Financial Institutions\n(in terms of assets, June 2006)\nInsurance, 34.2%  Mutual Funds, 23.1% \nVenture Capital, 0.5% \nDevelopment Financial  \nInstitutions, 18.2% \nDiscount Houses \n0.3% \nLeasing, 91% \nModerabas, 3.6%\nHousing  Investment Banks, 7.8%\nFinance, \n3.2%\n    Source: State Bank of Pakistan. \n \n7.  Government-owned NBFIs accounted for about 41% of NBFI total assets in June 2006, \ndown from 64% in June 2001. This decline was mainly caused by (i) the liquidation of state-\nowned development financial institutions or their merger with banks, and (ii) the privatization of \n(closed-end)  state-owned  mutual  funds.5  However,  the  Government  still  owns  a  significant \nproportion of (open-end) mutual funds, a large proportion of the insurance industry, and the \ndominating housing finance company. \n \n                                                 \n4  The 1996 Securities and Exchange Ordinance, as amended through the 2006 Finance Act, requires stock \nexchanges to corporatize and demutualize by 31 December 2006 or a later date as specified by the Securities and \nExchange Commission of Pakistan, which has extended the date for demutualization to 31 December 2007. \n5  The share of government-owned mutual funds in total assets of mutual funds declined from above 90% in June \n2001 to about 50% in June 2005. This was primarily the result of the privatization of funds managed by the \nInvestment Corporation of Pakistan in fiscal year 2003.  \n ", "34  Appendix 2 \n   \n8.  In June 2006, state-owned mutual funds accounted for 51% of total assets of the mutual \nfund industry, down from 91% in 2001. Although open-end mutual funds still dominate the \nmarket  (72%  of  assets),  closed-end  funds  have  gained  ground  since  2001.  The  National \nInvestment Trust Limited is the largest open-end mutual fund in Pakistan with assets of about \n$1.1 billion equivalent under management. The Government owns 8% of its shares directly and \nanother 33% indirectly through other government controlled entities. \n \n9.  As in many developing countries, the insurance subsector in Pakistan has remained \ndormant. Life insurance accounts for almost 66% of insurance assets. Insurance is dominated \nby state-owned companies, which account for 77% of total assets, down from 84% in 2001. \nState Life Insurance Company accounts for 75% of the insurance premiums in the country. \n \n10.  Banks are increasingly engaged in the capital market as issuer, investor, and provider of \ninvestment  banking  services.  A  number  of  banks  have  established  investment  banking \ndepartments  or  subsidiaries,  and  acquired  brokerage  houses.  Similarly,  some  NBFIs  and \nbrokers have acquired commercial banks; thereby further blurring the boundaries between the \nfinancial subsectors in Pakistan and intensifying interindustry competition. Another trend is the \nformation of groups of companies that include various financial companies. Some of these \ngroups have established informal holding companies.6 \n \n11.  Private pension funds have yet to appear as a class of institutional investors in Pakistan, \nalthough the Government has taken the first steps to allow private companies to offer private \npension products.7 Some large private companies sponsor a variety of provident funds and \npension schemes. However, their scope is not clear, as centralized reporting is not required  \n \n12.  The relative weight of various categories of financial institutions has also changed over \ntime. Total assets of the Pakistan financial sector amounted to $87 billion equivalent or 79% of \ngross domestic product (GDP) in 2005, up from $50 billion or 73% of GDP in 2001. Despite the \nintegration of NBFIs into commercial banks, overall assets of NBFIs kept increasing. However, \nas a percentage of GDP, NBFIs\u2019 assets rose only moderately from 4.9% in 2001 to 5.9% in \n2005,  which  was  7.5%  of  overall  financial  sector  assets.  Similarly,  assets  of  insurance \ncompanies, which were equivalent to 2.7% of GDP in 2001, increased to 3.1% of GDP or 3.9% \nof financial sector assets. Over the same period, banking assets increased from 46.7% of GDP \nto 55.6%, accounting for 70.4% of overall financial sector assets. As such, banking has gained \nground in absolute and relative terms. The bulk of the remaining financial sector assets were \nunder management of the state-owned Central Directorate of National Savings (18.1% of total); \nits assets as a percentage of GDP decreased from 18.8% in 2001 to 14.3% in 2005.8 \n \nB.  Regulation and Supervision \n \n13.  The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) regulates and supervises \nthe sector to enforce the 1984 Company Ordinance, the 1969 Securities Ordinance, and a \nnumber of other laws, including the 2000 Insurance Ordinance. SECP was set up in pursuance \nof the 1997 SECP Act and began operations in January 1999. It is a member of the International \nOrganization  of  Securities  Commissions  and,  as  such,  was  a  party  to  the  organization\u2019s \nresolution adopting the Statement of Objectives and Principles of Securities Regulation.  \n                                                 \n6  Pakistan has no holding company law. \n7  In 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan adopted voluntary pension system rules under which \nasset management companies and life insurance companies can act as pension fund managers. Life insurance \ncompanies can also offer annuity plans. \n8  Microfinance companies accounted for only 0.1% of overall financial sector assets. ", "  Appendix 2  35 \n   \n \n14.  While SECP\u2019s mandate was initially restricted to securities markets, responsibility for other \nNBFIs has been added. This was in line with a global tendency to move to integrated financial \nsector supervision. With regard to NBFIs (other than insurance), SECP introduced a regulatory \napproach allowing an NBFI to undertake a wide variety of financial services by increasing equity \ncapital.9 With regard to insurance, regulatory powers are shared with the Ministry of Commerce. \nBanks other than investment banks are regulated and supervised by the State Bank of Pakistan \n(SBP). SECP and SBP coordinate their supervisory activities, including of financial institutions \nunder their respective jurisdiction. \n \nC.  Overall Capital Market Development Trends \n \n15.  Since 2001, equity market capitalization and share prices have increased substantially in \nPakistan with growth rates averaging more than 50% each year. Equity market capitalization \nincreased from 9% of GDP or $5 billion equivalent in 2001, to 35% of GDP or $45.5 billion \nequivalent in 2006.10 Market capitalization is still lower than in other Asian markets such as \nMalaysia (155% of GDP), India (92%), or Thailand (68%), but this is mainly the result of slow \ndevelopment during the 1990s. More recently, Pakistan has been gaining ground (Figure A2.2). \n \nFigure A2.2: Change in Market Capitalization as Percent of GDP \n(percent change) \nThailand \nMalaysia \nIndonesia \nPakistan \nIndia \n0  200  400 600 800 1000  1200  1400 \n2000\u20132005 1990\u20132005\n    GDP = gross domestic product. \n    Source: International Monetary Fund, and World Exchange Federation.  \n \n16.  However, the increase of market capitalization in Pakistan was largely the result of listing \na number of large state-owned enterprises together with the growth in share prices rather than \nsuccessful capital mobilization through equity issues. \n \n                                                 \n9  The minimum paid-up capital required for an investment bank is PRs300 million. By adding an additional PRs200 \nmillion, the NBFI can obtain a license for leasing operations; an additional PRs200 million are required for a \ndiscount house, etc.     \n10  Figures related to equity market capitalization and listing refer to the Karachi Stock Exchange on which shares are \nmost actively traded. Most companies listed at the exchanges in Islamabad and Lahore are also listed in Karachi. \n ", "36  Appendix 2 \n   \n17.  With regard to market efficiency, liquidity (share turnover) increased by almost 400% in \nabsolute terms since 2000. In relation to GDP it increased from 36% in 2002 to 128% in 2005, \nwhich is high by regional standards (Table A2.1). The same applies to the ratio of share \nturnover to market capitalization. However, the market remains narrow with 95% of turnover \nconcentrated in the top 30 shares, and just over half in the top 10. Similarly, the 10 largest \ncompanies alone account for 55% of market capitalization.11 However, only an average of 20% \nof their shares has been floated.  \n \nTable A2.1: Capital Market Indicators, 2005 \n \n  Market  Market Capitalization     \n  Capitalization  of Top 10 Companies  Turnover  Turnover \nCountry  (% of GDP)  (%)  (% of GDP)  Ratioa \nPRC  25  25  26  1.04 \nIndia  137  35  55  0.40 \nIndonesia  30  53  15  0.50 \nMalaysia  141  37  38  0.27 \nPakistan  42  55  128  3.00 \nPhilippines  115  61  7  0.06 \nThailand  74  47  51  0.67 \nGDP = gross domestic product, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \na Defined as stock turnover to stock market capitalization. \nSources: International Monetary Fund, Federation of World Exchanges, and Asian Development Bank.  \n \n18.  Despite progress made with increasing market capitalization and comparatively high \nmarket turnover, Pakistan is clearly lagging other countries in the region in terms of resource \nmobilization through the capital market. In 2005, for instance, Pakistan companies tapped the \nequity market for some $68 million equivalent in new capital through initial ($14 million) and \nsecondary ($55 million) public offerings. This compares to $19.1 billion in India, $4 billion in the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  $3.7  billion  in  Thailand,  $2  billion  in  Malaysia,  $1  billion  in \nIndonesia, and $900 million in the Philippines. The amounts of equity capital raised in Pakistan \nover the preceding years were even lower than in 2005. The situation is the same for fixed-\nincome securities: only $203 million equivalent of capital was raised through corporate bond \nissues in Pakistan in 2005. \n \n19.  Capital raised through equity and bond issues together was equivalent to 0.3% of GDP \nin Pakistan. Banking products are still much more important for resource mobilization and \ncapital formation than the issuance of securities. While this is the case in many developed and \ndeveloping countries, banking system development in Pakistan is not out of touch with that of \nmost comparable economies, whereas capital market development is (Table 2 in main text). In \ncontrast to other countries in the region, Pakistan\u2019s capital market is not yet an important source \nof corporate finance.  \n \n20.  Nevertheless, the number of equity and bond issues in Pakistan has clearly increased as \ncompared with the 1990s. While 9 corporate bonds were issued in 1995\u20131999, 68 corporate \nbonds were issued in 2000\u20132005.12 During 2000\u20132005 banks accounted for 35% of total bond \nissues (by capital raised) and NBFIs 17% (Figure A2.3). Other corporate issuers represented \n                                                 \n11  Market capitalization is defined as the number of shares of listed companies multiplied by their market value. \nHowever, that does not mean that all shares of a company have been listed (floated). In 2005, listed capital \namounted to just 7.2% of GDP or 17.1% of market capitalization. \n12  The number and volume of privately placed bonds is not known, because official statistics only cover corporate \nbonds issued by listed companies under the Securities Law (1969).  ", "  Appendix 2  37 \n   \nthe remaining 48%, including about 20% of capital raised by two large oil and gas companies \nthat are still majority owned by the Government, namely Sui Southern Gas Company and Pak \nArab Refinery. Oil and gas companies were the major equity issuers accounting for 44% of \ncapital raised in 2000\u20132005 through a total of 39 equity issues. The financial sector represented \na mere 21% of total equity capital raised with 10% accounted for by banks and 11% by NBFIs.  \n \nFigure A2.3 Issuers of Securities (2000\u20132005, in percent) \n70\n60\n50\n35\n40 10 44\n30\n11\n20\n34\n30\n10 17 18\n0 \nNonbank Financial Commercial Banks Oil Gas and Power Other\nInstitutions Companies\nDebt Issues  Equity Issues \n    Source: State Bank of Pakistan. \n \n \n21.  The more recent issues of securities fit into this picture. In 2005, nonfinancial companies \naccounted  for  about  82%  of  equity  capital  raised  through  a  total  of  six  issues.  Pakistan \nPetroleum and Kot Addu Power Company predominated as they accounted for 68% of total \nissues. Both companies are majority owned by the Government.13 With regard to bond issues, \nbanks accounted for 68% of capital raised through a total of 10 bond issues in 2005, and NBFIs \nfor another 8%.  \n \n22.  Pakistan also has a market for government bonds. Pakistan investment bonds (PIBs) \nare by far the most significant type of securities issued by the Government with a share in total \noutstanding federal government bonds of 91% (June 2005). PIBs in circulation amounted to \n$5.1 billion equivalent (about 4% of GDP) in June 2006, down from $5.6 billion (about 4% of \nGDP) in June 2004. As such, the market for PIBs is much larger than that for corporate bonds \n(Figure A2.4). Maturities in circulation are 3, 5, 10, 20, and 30 years. PIBs are mostly held by \ncommercial banks; as of June 2005, 52% of bonds in circulation were held by banks, mainly \ndomestic private banks (70%), followed by state-owned banks (21%), and foreign banks (9%). \nWith regard to amount issued, $830 million equivalent (PRs49.23 billion) of bonds was raised in \n2004. This plummeted in 2005 to $2 million equivalent due to expectations of increasing interest \nrates, but increased again in 2006 to $750 million equivalent (PRs44.91 billion), approximately \n0.6% of GDP. \n \n                                                 \n13  The Government owns 78.4% of the capital of Pakistan Petroleum, while Water and Power Development Authority \nowns 46% of the capital of Kot Addu Power Company. \n ", "38  Appendix 2 \n   \nFigure A2.4: Bond Issues and Interest Rate Developments  \n1.60  14\n1.40  12\n1.20 \n10\n1.00 \n8\n0.80 \n6\n0.60 \n4\n0.40 \n0.20  2\n-  0\n2000 2001  2002 2003 2004 2005  2006\nPakistan investment bonds iIssued ($ billion, LHS) Corporate Bond Issues ($ billion, LHS) \n6 months Karachi interbank offered rate (June, RHS) Yield PIB 5 years - weighted average (June, RHS)\n    LHS = left hand side, RHS = right hand side.  \n    Source: State Bank of Pakistan. \n \n \n23.  Derivative markets are almost nonexistent in Pakistan (with the exception of currency \nfutures and 1-month single-stock futures) due to underdevelopment of the underlying equity and \nbond markets. High levels of derivative trading is usually associated with high equity or bond \ntrading volumes in deep and sufficiently wide cash markets, mainly because the development of \nderivatives necessitates sufficient liquidity of cash markets (including pricing benchmarks) to \nensure efficient price discovery. \n     \nD.  Factors Driving the Market \n \n24.  Privatization through the stock exchange has been a main factor driving the market, \ntogether  with  macroeconomic  stabilization,  and\u2014to  a  lesser  degree\u2014international  investor \ndiversification, development of domestic institutional investors, and other structural reforms. \n \n25.  Privatization. The Government has divested a large number of SOEs since the 1990s, \nsome of them by listing and partial privatization through the stock exchange(s). This has clearly \nbeen the main driving force for market capitalization and share prices. Among the 10 largest \nlisted companies are 6 SOEs, which together account for 42% of total market capitalization. \nThese SOEs are Oil and Gas Development Company (OGDCL), Pakistan Telecommunication \nCompany, National Bank of Pakistan, Pakistan Petroleum, Pakistan Oilfields, and Pakistan \nState  Oil  Company.  Most  of  these  companies  were  partially  privatized  through  the  stock \nexchange  over  the  last  5  years.  OGDCL\u2019s  initial  public  offering  (IPO),  for  instance,  was \nlaunched in 2003, when 5% of its shares were offered for sale through the stock exchange. A \ntotal of $114 million equivalent was raised. A subsequent secondary issue increased the share \nof floated OGDCL shares to 15% of total shares. As of January 2007, OGDCL accounted for \n18% of overall stock market capitalization. National Bank of Pakistan\u2019s IPO took place in 2002, \nwhen 10% of its shares were offered for sale. In 2002 and 2003, an additional 13.2% of its \nshares were sold through the stock exchange. A total of $29 million equivalent was raised \nthrough these three issues. National Bank of Pakistan accounted for 6.5% of total market \ncapitalization in January 2007. Pakistan Petroleum\u2019s IPO, which raised $18.1 million equivalent, \noccurred in 2004. This company accounted for another 6% of total market capitalization in ", "  Appendix 2  39 \n   \nJanuary 2007. Other large SOEs listed recently include United Bank (IPO in 2005, 15% of \nshares offered; $18.1 million equivalent raised) and Kot Addu Power Company (IPO in 2005; \n20% of shares offered; $80.2 million equivalent raised). Shares of SOEs offered for sale through \nthe stock market are typically heavily oversubscribed, given the expectation of subsequent \nsubstantial share price increases. \n \n26.  Structural  Reforms.  Undeniable  progress  has  been  made  in  Pakistan  with  other \nstructural reforms. These reforms have led to substantial changes such as a much higher share \nof private enterprises in- and outside the financial sector; consolidation of the NBFI subsector, \nwhich now consists of a smaller number of better capitalized and more efficiently managed \nentities; and a better regulatory and institutional framework for capital markets. Work is under \nway to enhance corporate governance and disclosure, which is important because both figure \nprominently in investment decisions. On the technical side, significant progress has been made \nin establishing electronic clearing and settlement systems. However, that has yet to turn the \ncapital  market  into  a  significant  source  of  capital  formation.  Moderate  progress  has, \nnevertheless, been made as evidenced by the increased number of securities issues. The policy \nof SBP to increase capital requirements for banks step-by-step has, for instance, motivated a \nnumber of commercial banks to raised capital through bond issues (paras. 20\u201321).   \n \n27.  Macroeconomic Environment. High economic growth, consumer demand, and higher \ncorporate earnings have certainly facilitated market development in Pakistan as compared with \nthe 1990s. The same applies to the monetary environment. The exchange rate and inflation \noutlook has stabilized since 1999, lengthening time horizons and reducing the cost of borrowing. \nInterest rates declined significantly during 2001\u20132003. Since 2004, inflation has picked up again \nand its outlook is less stable (Figure A2.5). This had a negative impact on the market for \ngovernment bonds, particularly in 2005 when only a small portion of the PIBs offered could be \nplaced (Figure A2.4). \n \n28.  The impact of higher and more volatile inflation and rising interest rates on the corporate \nbond market was mitigated by increasingly using floating rates for newly issued corporate \nbonds. Only two corporate bonds placed since 2004 had a fixed rate. Most other issues had a \nfloating rate anchored to the Karachi interbank offered rate (KIBOR) with a spread of 1.5 to 3.0 \npercentage points over KIBOR.14 In real terms, annual yields of such bonds were negative in \n2004 and early 2005, and subsequently increased over time to about 5%.  \n \n                                                 \n14  The anchor was mostly the 6-month Karachi interbank offered rate, since interest on these bonds is due every 6 \nmonths. \n ", "40  Appendix 2 \n   \n \nFigure A2.5: Interest Rate and Price Developments \n12 \n10 \nConsumer price inflation, year-on-year \n8 \n6 \n4  KIBOR  KK(6IIBB OOmRRo  ((n66th  mm),oo nnptthhe))r,,c  ppeeenrrtcc eennptte  ppr eerr  aaannnnnnuuummm   \n2 \n0 \nJUL 03  NOV03  MAR04  JUL 04  NOV04 MAR05 JUL 05 NOV05 MAR06  JUL 06  NOV06\nSource: State Bank of Pakistan. \n \nSource: State Bank of Pakistan. \n \n29.  Domestic Institutional Investors. Domestic institutional investors such as mutual funds \nor insurance companies have emerged as a relatively new force in Pakistan\u2019s financial sector. \nThe mutual funds subsector remains small relative to other countries in the region (Figure A2.6), \nand retail investors account for the bulk of exchange trading.15 However, assets of mutual funds \nand insurance companies have grown recently (para. 12). In 2006, total assets of mutual funds \namounted to $2.9 billion equivalent and insurance companies $3.4 billion. As such, they are \nrelevant forces in the market.  \n \n \n  Figure A2.6: Mutual Funds Assets under Management in 2006  \n  (as percent of GDP)\n \n  Philippines 1.4a \n \n  Indonesia  1.6 \n  Pakistan  2.2 \n \n  PRC  4.3 \n \nIndia 8.3\n \n  Thailand  14\n \nMalaysia  22.9\n \n \n0  5  10 15 20 25\n \n  Source: PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \n  a  2005 figure. \nSources: International Monetary Fund and Securities and Exchange Commission of\n                                                 \n15  About 40,000 individual investors have an account at Central Depository Company. Another 200,000 have \naccounts at Central Depository Company through brokers. An unknown number of individuals invest in securities \nthrough accounts of other individuals or brokers, although this is not permitted by law.  ", "  Appendix 2  41 \n   \n30.  Since the removal of controls on mutual fund activities, most funds focus on investment \nin equity. Equity funds accounted for 85% of total assets under management in 2005, debt \nfunds  for  only  1%.16  In  contrast,  insurance  companies  are  still  confronted  with  particular \nrestrictions on investments that can be made, although steps have been made to ease controls \non asset allocation. While 77% of the assets of life insurance companies were invested in \nsecurities in 2001\u20132005, these were mainly government securities. However, investment in \nequity  increased  from  10%  in  2001  to  16%  in  2005.  As  such,  insurance  companies  are \nincreasingly important as investors in corporate securities. \n \n31.  The increase in assets of mutual funds reflects higher prices of assets rather than \nadditional capital mobilized. Despite low deposit rates offered by banks, mutual funds still attract \na comparatively small proportion of national savings. The same applies to other institutional \ninvestors.  While  overall  national  savings  amounted  to  16.4%  of  GDP  in  FY2005,  savings \nmobilized by the financial sector amounted to only 7.5% of GDP. The bulk of financial savings is \naccounted for by banks (6.5% of GDP). Capital mobilized by mutual funds and other NBFIs \namounted to only 0.3 % of GDP (Table 1 in main text).   \n \n32.  In addition, the recent SBP decision to allow mutual funds to invest up to 30% of their \nassets  internationally  (with  a  cap  of  $15  million)  may  reduce  their  demand  for  domestic \nsecurities  in  the  short  term,  although  the  decision  is  certainly  beneficial  for  long-term \ndevelopment of the industry.  \n \n33.  Central Directorate of National Savings investments are concentrated in government \nsecurities. Despite the net outflow of its assets over recent years, this state-owned institution \nstill  had  an  estimated  $15.6  billon  under  management  in  2005.  Further,  the  state-owned \nEmployees\u2019 Old Age Benefits Institution,17 which provides mandatory defined benefit coverage \nfor workers of private enterprises with 10 or more employees, had another $1.6 billion under \nmanagement. Of these assets, 84% were invested in government securities, mainly low-yielding \ndefense  saving  certificates.  Investment  in  shares,  however,  increased  from  2%  of  total \ninvestment (June 2003) to 7% (June 2005).  \n   \n34.  International Investor Diversification. Inflow of portfolio investment into Pakistan has \nincreased recently, underlining the fact that the investor base of Pakistan companies is not \nrestricted  to  domestic  investors.  Foreign  portfolio  investment  rose  to  $334  million  during \nFY2006,  up  from  an  aggregated  inflow  of  $202  million  over  the  preceding  3  years.18 \nInternational investors now play a key role in Pakistan\u2019s capital market. While their accumulated \ninvestments are still relatively small, foreign investors own a significant share of the free float of \nequities, i.e., equity actually available for trading. The growing size of the capital market will \nmake Pakistan eligible for inclusion in an increasing number of international indices, which \nshould attract some renewed inflows from abroad and accelerate Pakistan\u2019s integration in global \ncapital markets. \n \n35.  The  increasing  inflow  of  foreign  portfolio  investment  in  Pakistan  is  in  line  with \ninternational and regional trends. One underlying factor is the dramatic increase of flows from \ndedicated emerging market funds; another is the loosening of controls on foreign investor \nparticipation.  \n \n                                                 \n16  The balance is accounted for by money market and mixed funds. \n17  The pension system in Pakistan also comprises civil servants pensions, which are unfunded, and a variety of \nprovident funds and pensions schemes sponsored and operated by large private employers.  \n18  This does not include investment into Eurobonds internationally issued by the Government of Pakistan.  \n ", "42  Appendix 2 \n   \n36.  Since 2002, foreign investors are no longer required to obtain prior SBP authorization to \ninvest in Pakistan securities on a repatriation basis. In particular, nonresidents, including foreign \nfirms, are free to (i) purchase and transfer shares issued by a public or private company in \nmanufacturing or in other sectors open to foreign investors as per the Government Investment \nPolicy (e.g., infrastructure and agriculture); (ii) transfer shares quoted on the stock exchanges \nirrespective of the business of the company; (iii) transfer Pakistan securities on a repatriable \nbasis to other eligible nonresidents on the same basis against payment outside Pakistan; (iv) \npurchase Government securities; and (v) purchase and transfer corporate debt instruments \ndenominated in local currency. Nonresidents are allowed to trade shares quoted on the stock \nexchanges  in  Pakistan,  provided  they  open  a  special  convertible  rupee  account  with  any \nauthorized dealer in Pakistan. The funds deposited in this account can be transferred outside \nPakistan or credited to a foreign currency account maintained in Pakistan at any time without \nany approval of SBP. These accounts can also be credited with dividend income. Listed stock in \nPakistan (except in life insurance companies) have no foreign investment ceiling. As such, \ncontrols on foreign investment in shares and bonds have been substantially loosened.19 Entry \nand exit of foreign investment is free. The resulting inflows of foreign portfolio investment have \nbeen taken on a rapidly increasing role in driving the market, and reflect Pakistan\u2019s significant \nprogress in integrating into global capital markets.  \n \n37.  Apart  from  foreign  portfolio  investments  into  securities  traded  in  Pakistan,  Pakistan \ncompanies can also raise capital abroad. This can, for instance, be in the form of cross-listing at \na foreign exchange. Cross-listing allows individual companies to achieve integration with global \ncapital markets and benefit from better market infrastructure and an expanded investor base. \nTwo Pakistan companies, MCB Bank and OGDCL, have taken this step so far. MCB Bank was \nlisted at the London Stock Exchange in October 2006 where it issued global depository receipts \nto increase its capital. A total of $155 million equivalent (\u00a379 million) was raised. OGDCL was \nlisted at the London Stock Exchange in December 2006 when the Government of Pakistan \ndivested an additional 10% of its shareholding in the company by issuing an equivalent amount \nof  global  depository  receipts.20  The  total  capital  raised  was  $934  million  equivalent  (\u00a3477 \nmillion), mainly from international institutional investors. Only 5% was reportedly absorbed by \nPakistan investors. \n \n38.  Table A2.2 provides key financial sector indicators for Pakistan. \n \n \n                                                 \n19  In 2005, SBP adopted additional measures to liberalize the foreign exchange regime, which include (i) the \npossibility for authorized dealers to provide foreign exchange up to a maximum of $100,000 or equivalent in other \ncurrencies to branches of foreign companies operating in Pakistan for payments for utilization of information \ntechnology services; and (ii) permission to Pakistan companies to purchase and sell foreign currency notes and \ncoins. \n20  See para. 25. After listing at the London Stock Exchange, the Government shareholding in OGCDL stands at \n85.02% of total paid-up capital of the company.

Description of the Financial (Nonbank) Markets and Governance Program \n \n1.  In  December  2002,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  the  Financial \n(Nonbank)  Markets  and  Governance  Program  (FMGP)  loan  for  $260  million  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources and two technical assistance (TA) loans,1 each for $3 million, from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to the Government of Pakistan. The overall goal of the FMGP \nwas to facilitate private-sector-led productivity growth and social protection. This was to be \nachieved by improving the framework for mobilization of long-term resources for saving and \ninvestment through market-based financial instruments and institutions.  \n \n2.  The  FMGP  was  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  financial  sector  reform  agenda,  and \ndevelopment of capital markets and other nonbank financial services. The FMGP aimed to \nachieve  this  by  (i)  strengthening  investor  confidence  through  improved  governance, \ntransparency,  and  investor  protection;  (ii)  increasing  the  depth  and  diversity  of  financial \nintermediation  through  new  capital  market  issues  to  mobilize  savings  and  investments; \n(iii) improving operating efficiency and risk management of intermediaries; and (iv) reducing \nfinancial sector vulnerabilities. \n \n3.  To achieve these objectives, reform measures were implemented, including for policy, \ngovernance, institutions, and market operations. The reform agenda was structured around five \ncomponents: (i) improvement of the fiscal, interest rate, and investment policy environment; \n(ii) improvement  of  governance  of  market  participants  and  transparency  in  information \ndisclosure;  (iii)  increase  in  supply  of  financial  instruments  and  improvements  in  market \ninfrastructure;  (iv)  increase  in  demand  for  financial  instruments  through  development  of \ncontractual  savings  and  institutional  investment;  and  (v)  development  of  related  financial \nservices and institutions. \n \nB.  Overall Program Performance  \n \n4.  The FMGP was a comprehensive reform effort, in that it focused on almost all aspects of \nnonbank financial sector development in Pakistan. Among others, it aimed to strengthen the \nlegal and regulatory framework for securities markets, facilitate privatization through the stock \nexchanges, enact legislation on financial transactions and corporate affairs, and revamp large \nGovernment controlled institutions in life insurance. The FMGP established a good environment \nfor change.  \n \n5.  However, accomplishment of many of the specific measures will need significantly more \ntime.  The  efforts  required,  the  complexity  of  reforms,  and  the  political  sensitivity  were \ndisproportionate to the time provided to achieve such reforms in any developing country. For \ninstance, the FMGP had 42 policy conditions (with 97 subconditions) at the outset. A program \nloan of $260 million was approved in December 2002 to provide financing for structural reforms, \ndesigned to be disbursed in three tranches. The first tranche of $100 million was released in \nMay 2003 against the fulfillment of 24 conditions (comprising 40 subconditions).  \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Loans and \nGuarantees to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Financial (Nonbank) Markets and Governance Program. \nManila (TA Loan 1956-PAK: Strengthening Pension, Insurance and Savings Systems, and TA Loan 1957-PAK: \nStrengthening Regulation, Enforcement, and Governance of Nonbank Financial Markets). ", "  Appendix 3  45   \n   \n6.  The remaining 18 conditions were divided into 57 subconditions. Symptomatic of the \ncomplexity is the delay in reaching full compliance. In September 2005, an incentive subtranche of \n$80 million was released against the fulfillment of 9 conditions (comprising 26 subconditions). This \ninvolved a delay of about 2 years, as the incentive tranche was planned to be disbursed in \nNovember 2003. The remaining tranche of $80 million has been pending since November 2004, \nwith 9 policy conditions (comprising 31 subconditions) to be complied with. However, to date, after \nabout 30 months, a number of these conditions remain only partly complied with. Such delays, \nwhile justifiable with hindsight, have reduced the reform momentum. More importantly, the rigidity \nof  certain  policy  conditions,  in  areas  such  as  enactment  of  legislation  or  privatization,  has \nintroduced a sense of trauma in the minds of Government officials championing the reforms.  \n \nC.  Proposed Approach for Carrying the Reforms Forward \n \n7.  In view of the difficulties entailed in implementing the FMGP, the Government has asked \nADB to cancel the pending FMPG tranche of $80 million. However, it remains committed to the \nreforms envisaged under the FMGP, but a longer time frame and a more targeted approach will \nbe needed. The Government has asked ADB to design a focused capital market reform agenda \nthrough the proposed Second Generation Capital Market Reform Program. Specifically, the \nGovernment has been particular that any legislative actions should be targeted. Reforms in the \ninsurance subsector and public pension system, while important for capital market reforms, will \nrequire greater consensus building within the Government. They should be pursued under a \ndedicated contractual savings reform initiative.  \n \n8.  On the basis of the request, the Second Generation Capital Market Reform Program \ntargets primarily those actions that are within the control of the Government, and specifically \nwithin  the  domain  of  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  of  Pakistan  (SECP).  The \ninvolvement and commitment of a single nodal agency such as SECP is vital for successful \nimplementation of the reforms. For instance, 8 of the 9 conditions that were fulfilled for the \nincentive tranche were within SECP\u2019s mandate. \n \n9.  Figure A3 presents a schematic view of how the reform agenda supported by ADB in the \nnonbank financial subsectors has emerged over the last 10 years, starting with the Capital \nMarket Development Program approved in 1997, to the FMGP approved in 2002, moving to the \nproposed Program. Table A3.1 aims to show the linkages between the policy reforms adopted \nin the FMGP, and how they will be pursued under the proposed Program, with specific focus on \nthe 9 policy conditions that have not been fully complied with.2 In contrast, Table A3.2 outlines \nthe status of compliance with the 9 policy conditions that were complied with by 2005, and \njustified the release of the incentive tranche under the FMGP. \n \n10.  Based on extensive consultations with the Government and assessments made by staff, \nthe proposed approach is prudent for supporting forward-looking reforms. It is targeted and \nrecognizes the time required to change mindsets to achieve consensus and fully implement \nreforms.  The  legislative  agenda  is  modest,  confined  to  securities  markets.  However,  the \nproposed legislation would enable Pakistan to form an integrated nonbank financial sector \nsupervisor  by  upgrading  SECP  to  the  Financial  Services  Commission  of  Pakistan.  The \nprivatization  agenda  is  targeted,  with  support  for  the  gradual  steps  to  be  taken  for  the \ndivestment  of  the  National  Investment  Trust.  ADB  will  undertake  other  more  complex \ninstitutional reform in the insurance and public pension subsectors separately under dedicated \nprograms after building adequate consensus. \n                                                 \n2  The Board paper on the incentive subtranche presents the full details on the compliance with the other 9 policy \nconditions  (comprising  26  subconditions).

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nIs the sector identified as a national priority in    Yes  Is the sector identified as a   Yes \ncountry poverty analysis?      national priority in country   \n      No  poverty partnership agreement?     No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Pakistan: \n \nThe Government\u2019s poverty reduction and strategy paper (PRSP), completed in December 2003, rests on four pillars: (i) \nachieving high and broad-based economic growth focusing particularly on the rural economy, while maintaining \nmacroeconomic stability; (ii) improving governance and consolidating devolution; (iii) investing in human capital with a \nrenewed emphasis on effective delivery of basic social services; and (iv) bringing the poor and vulnerable and \nbackward regions into the mainstream of development, and making marked progress in reducing existing inequalities.  \n \nThe first pillar comprises several policy and structural elements including reforming the financial sector, developing the capital \nmarket, streamlining the regulatory framework, providing supportive infrastructure, and developing a rural development \nstrategy. \n \nPoverty  reduction  is  an  encompassing  objective  of  Pakistan\u2019s  Medium-Term  Development  Framework  (MTDF)   \n2005\u20132010. The MTDF subsumes the Government\u2019s PRSP. The MTDF lists growth of the private sector, development \nof privatization in infrastructure (which requires long-term debt financing through corporate bonds), as well as capital \nmarket development as important goals. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                      Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe Pakistan Economic Survey 2005\u20132006, released in June 2006, reports that the percentage of the population living \nbelow the poverty line has fallen from 34.46% in 2001 to 23.90% in 2004/05, a decline of 10.6 percentage points. The \npercentage of population living below the poverty line in rural areas has declined from 39.26% to 28.10%, while that in \nurban areas has declined from 22.69% to 14.9%. Rural poverty declined by 11.16 percentage points and urban \npoverty by 7.79 percentage points. A strong economic growth (7.5% average) for 3 years in a row, a large inflow of \nremittances (over $4 billion per annum) in recent years, and many other interventions contributed to the decline in \npoverty. Notwithstanding this development, around 36.45 million people in Pakistan still live below the poverty line. \nFurther reduction in poverty is a major challenge for the Government. \n \nDespite the progress made in implementing capital market reforms, the contribution of the sector to private sector \ndevelopment has been as weak as its role in capital mobilization for productive investment. The Program will enhance \nthe capital markets\u2019 capacity to carry out its intermediation role effectively by deepening reforms, and strengthening the \nenabling policy, legal, regulatory, and institutional environment for nonbank financial institutions and markets. This will \nimprove companies\u2019 access to finance; facilitate people\u2019s access to financial services, particularly pension products; \nand help to protect vulnerable parts of the population against fraud:  \n \n(i)  The Program aims at removing the major constraints to the development of the corporate bond market by \nreducing the costs of issuing bonds, simplifying the underlying procedures, and supporting the development of a \nbenchmark yield curve for pricing corporate bonds. Corporate bond market development will facilitate the financing of \ninfrastructure projects, which requires long-term finance in the form of bonds (fixed-income securities). This will \nsupport poverty reduction goals by helping to provide the population with infrastructure services and freeing up public \nresources needed to provide social services. Further, the Program will support balanced development of the financial \nsector, which will make the financial sector less vulnerable to crisis, by which low-income groups of the population tend \nto be more seriously affected than high-income groups. \n \n(ii)  The limited availability of contractual savings (e.g., complementary pension schemes) has made the weakest \npart of the population more vulnerable to uncertain events. The Program will support development of institutional \ninvestors by improving the legal and regulatory framework of voluntary private pension and occupational saving \nschemes. This will allow low-income groups of the population to enter into well-regulated and protected contractual \nsavings schemes, access the capital market through these schemes, and benefit from higher returns of capital market \ninstruments. The outreach of new pension products, for which the Program will provide an enabling framework, will be \ncountrywide, i.e., include rural areas where the poor are concentrated. \n \n(iii)  The Program will help to strengthen the governance of nonbank financial institutions and markets. This will \nincrease market transparency and the protection of investors against fraud,  which is particularly important for \nunsophisticated investors, including vulnerable parts of the population.
