The IBAs will guide the new \nboards and management through a major program of operational \nrestructuring,  focusing  on  improved  governance  policies, \nprocedures for resolving nonperforming loans (NPLs), and cost \nreduction.  An  information technology (IT) upgrade will support \nthese new governance structures by enabling improved financial \nreporting to management, the shareholder, and the supervisory \nauthority through more efficient and reliable processing of, and \nreporting on, transactions throughout the nationwide systems. \n   \nRationale  The Government is embarking on a broad reform program aimed \nat macrostability, improved financial management throughout the \neconomy,  and  strengthened  private  sector  orientation.  The \nGovernment\u2019s program is supported by a number of instruments \nincluding an International Monetary Fund (IMF) poverty reduction \nand growth facility (PRGF), a World Bank financial management \nadjustment credit (FMAC) and capacity-building credit. In addition, \na Banking Sector Reform Program Loan has been proposed for \nconsideration by the Board of Directors of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) in November 2002. The goal of all intensive efforts is \nto reform the SOCBs. \n \n  The  Government  has  requested  technical  assistance  (TA)  to \ncompensate  for  and  strengthen  the  limited  capacity  of  SOCB \nmanagement and staff to apply and enforce good commercial \npractice and behavior.  The TA loan is an integral part of the \nbanking  sector  reform  effort  in  that  it  seeks  to  implement \nprinciples  of  good  governance  throughout  SOCB  operations. \nUnder the TA  loan, the consultants will support banking sector \nreform  by  introducing  sound  commercial  banking  policies  and \nprocedures, particularly in relation to the credit approval process \nand  NPL  collection.  On-the-job  experience  coupled  with \nsimultaneous formal and informal training by the IBAs will sustain \nthe impact of the restructuring program. IT upgrades and training \nwill  support  better  control  and  more  efficient  operations  and \nfacilitate a well-implemented restructuring effort. \n   ", "iii \nObjectives and Scope  The TA will foster improvements in governance of the SOCBs and \nin  their  financial  performance  by  introducing  modern  banking \npolicies and procedures. This objective will be achieved by (i) \nresolving NPLs through  a case-by-case focus on cash recovery \nand legal action; (ii) ensuring that new flows of credit are secured \nby cash flows; (iii) introducing a client-and-business orientation in \nbanking relationships, particularly in assisting small and medium \nenterprises  (SMEs)  to  present  bankable  projects;  and  (iv) \nreducing costs through better economies of scale. \n   \nCost Estimates  The total cost of the project is $4.83 million equivalent, comprising \nforeign exchange costs of $3.51 million and local currency costs \nof $1.32 million equivalent. \n   \nFinancing Plan  The  proposed  financing  is  for  an  ADB  TA  loan  of  $4  million \nequivalent, including $0.49 million equivalent of the local currency \ncost. The Government will finance a minimum of $0.83 million \nequivalent of local currency costs. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  The  loan  will  be  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  3.024 \nmillion from ADB's Special Funds resources, with a maturity of 32 \nyears including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest charge \nof 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter. The Borrower will be the Lao PDR.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2006 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2005 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  A bank restructuring implementation committee (BRIC), chaired \nArrangements  by  the  deputy  governor  of  Bank  of  Lao  PDR  (BOL),  will  be \nestablished to oversee the implementation of the TA loan. The \nBRIC will include the BOL director and deputy directors who were \nin charge of project design. The BRIC will coordinate with other \nGovernment departments and agencies and with all aid agencies \nparticipating in the banking reform program. A senior official from \nthe  BRIC  will  be  appointed  as  project  director  to  guide  TA \nimplementation. BOL will establish an implementation unit (PIU) to \ncoordinate the day-to-day implementation of the components; and \nwill  provide  adequate  office  space,  secretarial  support, \ninterpreters and translators, other qualified local counterpart staff \nas needed, and local transportation. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Bank of Lao PDR \n   ", "iv \nProcurement  The IT system, including training, will be procured as a single \npackage of $0.55 million to ensure compatibility of the customized \nIT  systems  training  for  the  staff.  Procurement  will  be  by \ninternational  competitive  bidding  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement, or any other procurement method \nacceptable to ADB. \n   \nConsulting Services  Consultants  will  provide  240  person-months  of  consulting \nservices: 108 person-months for international consultants and 132 \nperson-months  for  domestic  consultants.  The  international \nconsultants  will  have  expertise  in  bank  management  and \nturnaround,  credit  assessment,  asset/liability  management, \naccounting  and  auditing,  human  resources,  IT,  and  NPL \nresolution.  The  international  consultants  will  be  four  resident \nbanking advisors, each working 9 months per year for 3 years, \neach  supported  by  local  research  assistants.  The  domestic \nconsultants will be bilingual banking assistants, each assigned to \none  IBA.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  individually  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The principal benefit will be greater transparency, certainty, and \nBeneficiaries  predictability  in  commercial  bank  transactions,  particularly  the \ninitiation  of  loans  and  the  enforcement  of  loan  and  security \nobligations.  The  changes  will  foster  a  better  environment  for \ncommercial  transactions  and  will  allow  the  banks  to  attract  a \nstronger  set  of  borrowers.  A  second  benefit  is  support  for \nmacroeconomic stability and poverty reduction by reducing the \nrisk  of  banking  sector  instability.  The  lower  risk  premium  of \nlending  rates  will  allow  a  greater  range  of  borrowers  to  gain \naccess  to  loan  financing.  Moreover,  reduced  losses  in  SOCB \ncapital  will  enable  the  Government  to  reorient  its  expenditure \nframework  toward  higher  priority  social  expenditures.  Another \nimportant  long-term  benefit  will  be  the  capacity  for  future \ndevelopment  of  the  commercial  system  built  into  the  SOCB \nmanagement and staff. The project beneficiaries will include the \nSOCB management and staff, their potential clients, and the wider \nrange of the population, including the poor, who will benefit from \ngreater stability and economic growth. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  first  risk  is  the  potential  reemergence  of  macroeconomic \ninstability, which would undermine the banking sector reform. This \nmacroeconomic  risk  will  be  minimized  through  the  tightly \nmonitored fiscal and monetary framework under the IMF\u2019s PRGF, \nand the budget and state-owned enterprise reforms supported by \nthe World Bank\u2019s FMAC. \n ", "v \n  Second, resistance from defaulting borrowers and other former \nbeneficiaries of noncommercial banking activity, particularly in the \nprovinces, could erode the political will to sustain the medium-\nterm reform program. This risk is being mitigated by a program \ninitiated more than a year ago in which the Government achieved \na sense of ownership and facilitated strong coordination among \nthe  international  financial  institutions  (IFIs)  in  dialogue  and \ninstruments.  This  effort  will  continually  strengthen  throughout \nprogram implementation. \n \n  The  third  risk  is  that  restructuring  the  SOCBs  may  result  in \nredundancies and this could lead to resentment and grassroots \nresistance. Consultation and awareness building have begun and \nwill  continue  throughout  implementation.  The  Government,  in \nconsultation with the stakeholders and as agreed upon with ADB, \nhas also committed that a mitigation plan will be an integral part of \nthe  restructuring  program  should  the  program  have  adverse \neffects on vulnerable SOCB staff.  \n ", " \n \n ", "     \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) loan to  the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the \nBanking Sector Reform Project. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  Following high inflation and currency depreciation in 1998/99, the Government has been \nsuccessful in stabilizing the economy. In April 2001, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) \napproved a three-year arrangement under a poverty reduction and growth facility (PRGF). \nDuring the first year of the PRGF, inflation remained at around 7% and the economy expanded \nat 5.2%. However, stability is fragile and financial sector restructuring and reforms of state-\nowned enterprises are needed to ensure that problems in the banking sector do not contribute \nto macroeconomic instability. \n \n3.  The financial sector in the Lao PDR needs to become considerably deeper through \nimproved intermediation and outreach to promote the higher growth required for sustained \npoverty reduction. Currently the sector is dominated by three state-owned commercial banks \n(SOCBs) which collectively account for about 70% of the total assets of the banking system.1 \nBranches  of  several  foreign  banks  operate  in  Vientiane,  but  deficiencies  in  the  banking \nenvironment, particularly the legal and judicial framework in which they operate, and limitations \non their activities have so far limited their contribution to the domestic economy.  \n \n4.  In recent years nonperforming loans (NPLs) have risen significantly and other assets of \nquestionable quality have shown worrisome growth. This performance reflects factors external \nto  the  banks,  such  as  the  hangover  from  the  macroeconomic  instability  prior  to  2000, \ndeficiencies in the judicial and security system, and borrowers with limited capacity to present \nbankable projects. But there are also fundamental institutional weaknesses, including limited \nhuman  resource  capacity,  inadequate  information  technology  (IT),  overstaffing,  inadequate \nattention to prudent risk management, and poorly functioning governance structures (e.g., \nboards, committees, policies and procedures). As a result, losses in the SOCB sector totaled \naround $27 million in 1998-2001.  \n \n5.  The Government requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide financial and \ntechnical  support  for  its  program  to  address  the  policy  environment  for,  and  institutional \nweaknesses in, the banking and financial sector. A project preparatory technical assistance \n(PPTA) (i) conducted an operational and financial diagnosis of the SOCBs; (ii) gave additional \ninformation on SOCB classification and reporting of the credit portfolio; (iii) prepared operational \nand financial restructuring plans for the SOCBs, with special emphasis on strengthening credit \nculture through case-by-case NPL resolution; and (iv) proposed a legal and judicial framework \nto support good banking. The PPTA was completed in June, 2002 and the Government has \nprepared a program aimed at fostering efficient intermediation of depositor resources and \nensuring a sound banking sector. \n \n6.  The TA loan is a key instrument supporting Government\u2019s banking reform program. In \naddition, a proposed banking sector reform program loan has been prepared for consideration \nby the Board. The Government\u2019s program will foster efficient financial intermediation through the \n                                                 \n1  The SOCBs are currently Banque pour le Commerce Exterieur [BCEL], which has about 45% of banking sector \nassets; Lane Xang Bank, which holds about 13% of banking sector assets, and Lao May Bank, with about 12%.  ", "2   \ncreation  of  a  sound  banking  sector  capable  of  supporting  private-sector-led  growth  and \nextending  outreach  to  rural  areas.  The  program  would  involve  (i)  introducing  commercial \nprinciples  in  SOCB  operations;  (ii)  adopting  improved  internal  incentives  and  governance \nstructures in the SOCBs; (iii) setting up a legal judicial and prudential regulation system that \nbrings failed borrowers, strategic defaulters, and unsound banks to account; (iv) creating a \nrange of institutional models and methodologies for extending financial services; and (v) giving \ncreditworthy private sector firms a better access to commercial finance. \n \n7.  Under the program, the Government will reduce the number of SOCBs from three to two, \nand modern governance policies and procedures will be introduced to the principal risk areas of \nthe  banks:  credit  approvals,  asset/liability  management,  and  internal  audit.  Operational \nrestructuring will also involve downgrading or disposing of unprofitable branches accompanied \nby appropriate deployment of the best fixed assets and staff, with particular emphasis on top \nand middle management.  \n \n8.  The SOCB restructuring program will require complex skills and expertise not readily \navailable in the Lao PDR. The Government requested a TA loan to support 3 years of work of \ninternational banking advisors (IBAs) and an IT program to assist SOCBs\u2019 boards of directors \nand management teams achieve their objectives. The TA loan forms an integral part of the \nreform program by ensuring three key objectives are achieved: (i) implementation of the recently \nreiterated commercial mandate of the SOCBs, (ii) strengthened credit discipline in banks and \nborrowers through a case-by-case approach to NPL resolution, and (iii) a banking sector that is \nmore responsive to the needs of the private commercial sector. The project framework  is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objectives \n9.  The objective of the TA is to foster improvements in the governance of the SOCBs by \nintroducing modern banking policies and procedures and reversing the financial performance of \nthe SOCBs. The objective will be achieved by (i) resolving NPLs through a case-by-case focus \non cash recovery and legal action; (ii) ensuring that new flows of credit are secured by cash \nflows; (iii) introducing a client-and-business orientation in banking relationships, for example by \nassisting small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to present bankable projects; and (iv) reducing \ncosts through better economies of scale.  \n  \nB.  Components and Outputs \n10.  The TA loan will finance two resident IBAs in each of the two remaining SOCBs for 3 \nyears, to build capacity while helping to implement the specific restructuring activities. Detailed \nterms of reference for the advisors are in Appendix 2. To support the implementation of new \ngovernance policies and procedures, the TA will also finance IT systems that allow more \naccurate reporting to management, the shareholder, and the supervisor, and increase efficiency \nand control in processing transactions, particularly for the nationwide branch network. \n \n1.  Implementation of Operational Restructuring Modules \n11.  The SOCBs will undergo full governance reform as the centerpiece of the operational \nrestructuring. The reform will be initiated at the top with the installation of new board chairmen, \nboard members, and management teams willing and able to take on the challenge of managing \n ", "    3 \na restructuring effort while absorbing intensive training required to implement new policies and \nprocedures.  \n \n12.  The principles, terms and conditions associated with operational restructuring have been \nagreed upon in advance in memoranda of understanding between the owner represented by the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF), the Bank of the Lao PDR (BOL) as regulator, and the SOCB that \ncommit all parties to a specified program. Included are measurable targets and goals against \nwhich SOCB performance will be assessed. The Program will be closely supervised and will be \nupdated annually on the basis of current conditions and external audits that (i) report on \nperformance indicators, (ii) provide operational audits of key areas, and (iii) provide guidance in \nrevising the following year\u2019s program.  \n \n13.  The first year of operational restructuring will focus on a comprehensive program to \nintroduce, implement, and maintain new governance systems including board and management \ncommittees. Initially, there will be stringent interim operational policies2 that are to be gradually \nreplaced with full board-approved policies under the guidance of the IBAs covering the key \nareas of portfolio management, new credit extension, asset/liability management, and internal \naudit. These more effective operational policies and procedures, supported by better systems, \nIT,  and  reporting  methodology  will  be  implemented  throughout  the  SOCBs,  with  special \nemphasis on branches. As a result, decisions will be more transparent, based on commercial \nprinciples, and accurately recorded. \n \n14.  IBAs will play a critical role in the restructuring activities. Their principal duties will be to \n(i) help banks implement the governance reforms, particularly the board-approved operational \npolicies; (ii) oversee improvements in systems and procedures to support these policies; (iii) \nsupport the comprehensive program of NPL resolution; (iv) assist in downsizing the institutions; \nand (v) continuously monitor key activities, particularly credit origination and NPL resolution.  \n \n15.  A key aspect of the Government\u2019s reform program is the emphasis on development of \nhuman resource capacity within the SOCBs. The IBAs will play a critical role in training and \ncoaching the bank staff. The on-the-job training provided by the IBAs will complement and \nreinforce a formal human resource development program involving (i) an effort to match existing \nstaff skills to job requirements; and (ii) tailored training programs, including scholarships based \non the assessed needs in key areas such as accounting, auditing, and IT.3  \n \n16.  To strengthen credit discipline for the future, special emphasis will be given to the NPLs. \nA specific plan to address these NPLs has been prepared and will be implemented under the \nguidance of the IBAs. The plan will be based on a case-by-case analysis of each NPL account \nin the portfolio and will include a strategy and detailed implementation procedures, focusing on \ncash collection and court action. Active implementation will be facilitated through performance \ntargets  on  banks  and  on  the  judiciary,  which  is  being  strengthened  under  a  part  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s program.  \n \n                                                 \n2  Interim operational policies will include (i) interim credit policies to fully document and closely monitor any new loan \napprovals to curtail NPLs, (ii) interim portfolio policies to closely monitor portfolios and accelerate NPL cash \ncollection, (iii) interim asset/liability management policies to maximize returns from existing assets, and (iv) interim \ninternal audit policies to establish an internal audit function. \n3  A program sponsored by the European Union, Euro-TAL:Bank Training Program \u2013 will provide 2 years of formal \ntraining for all SOCB staff and scholarships for exceptional performers. The program will be coordinated with the \nhuman resource module of the restructuring program. ", "4   \n2.  Upgrade of Information Technology  \n17.  Currently all SOCBs in the Lao PDR use the same limited-function back office software \nconsisting of a simple general ledger and chart of accounts system. It was developed locally in \n1997, and is limited and outdated.4 The inability to generate accurate and timely management \nand  supervisory  information  hinders  any  ability  to  implement  good  oversight  and  control \nfunctions. \n \n18.  However, the skill level of IT staff in both BOL and SOCBs is low, and it would be difficult \nto  introduce  a  complex  international  standard  banking  software  system.  The  TA  loan  will \ntherefore  assist  the  SOCBs  to  implement  an  intermediate-level  software  package  for  the \nbanking system which integrates the front and back offices, provides a low-cost solution and is \naccompanied by an IT training program to ensure a cadre of some 20 well-trained IT staff \nthroughout BOL and the SOCBs.5  \n \n19.  The scope of the new system will allow SOCBs to \n \n(i)  improve customer service levels for current products and services \n(ii)  expand a range of products and services as the banks\u2019 develop and mature \n(iii)  target services through more efficient operations \n(iv)  improve management information and control processes, and \n(v)  manage cash flows more effectively. \n \nC.  Cost Estimates \n20.  The total cost of the project is $4.83 million equivalent, comprising foreign exchange \ncosts of $3.51 million and local currency costs of $1.32 million equivalent.  \n \nD.  Financing Plan \n21.  The proposed financing is for an ADB TA loan of $4.0 million equivalent, including $0.49 \nmillion equivalent of the local currency cost. The Government will finance the balance of $0.83 \nmillion equivalent of local currency costs. The TA loan will be from the Special Funds resources \nwith a maturity of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years. The annual interest charge will \nbe 1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. The loan will be utilized over a 42-month \nperiod from loan effectiveness. A summary of the costs and the financing plan is in Table 1, and \nthe detailed table of cost estimates and financing plan is in Appendix 3. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n22.  BOL will be the Executing Agency for the TA loan and will have overall responsibility for \nensuring timely project implementation and reporting to ADB on progress made, problems \nencountered, remedial actions taken during the previous quarter, and proposed activities and \nexpected  progress  during  the  next  quarter.  BOL  will  establish  a  bank  restructuring \n                                                 \n4  In particular, there is no real-time interface for transaction input to the back office system. Customer transactions \nare initiated and approved using standard paper documents. The bank staff then manually input the transaction to \nthe back office accounting system for record keeping. \n5  Comprehensive training will be organized for the IT staff in BOL and the SOCBs in the course of procurement so \nthat their IT skill can be elevated to undertake future support and development of banking system software. \n ", "    5 \nimplementation  committee  (BRIC),  chaired  by  the  deputy  governor  of  BOL,  to  oversee \nimplementation of the TA loan, and ensure that the proposed reforms and TA activities follow \nthe agreed-upon timetable. In particular, the BRIC will meet quarterly, establish performance \ncriteria  with  which  to  monitor  the  performance  of  IBAs,  and  lead  the  annual  tripartite \nperformance  reviews.  A  member  of  the  BRIC  will  be  appointed  as  TA  project  director. \nImplementing  agencies  for  the  TA  loan  will  include  the  SOCBs  and  BOL,  which  will  be \nresponsible for effective day-to-day implementation of the TA loan components. MOF will be \nresponsible for monitoring the use of the loan proceeds. \n \nTABLE 1: COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($\u2019000) \n \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost \nI.

The international \nconsultants  will  have  expertise  in  bank  management  and  turnaround,  credit  assessment, \nasset/liability management, accounting and auditing, human resources, IT, and NPL resolution. \nThe international consultants will be four resident banking advisors, each working 9 months per \nyear for 3 years, each supported by local research assistants. The domestic consultants will be \nbilingual banking assistants, each assigned to one IBA. The consultants will be recruited \nindividually in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n \n27.  To expedite project implementation, the Government is pursuing advance action in \nengaging consultants. Selection is expected to advance up to the ranking of candidates. The \nGovernment has been informed that approval of advance action does not in any way commit \nADB to finance the relevant expenditures under the Project or the Project itself. To enhance the \nperformance of the IBAs, contracts with each individual will be renewed annually, subject to \nsatisfactory  performance  measured  through  regular  comprehensive  tripartite  performance \nreviews. \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n28.  Eligible expenditures from the loan proceeds will be paid either through direct payment \nprocedure, commitment procedure, and/or imprest fund procedure in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan  Disbursement  Handbook,  January  2001,  as  amended  from  time  to  time.  Loan \ndisbursements  for  the  consulting  services  contracts  will  make  use  of  the  direct  payment \nprocedure, while IT equipment and software will be procured using the commitment procedure. \nThe Government will establish an imprest account for the PIU to manage, replenish, and \nliquidate  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and  any  detailed \narrangements between the Government and ADB. The initial amount to be advanced to the \nimprest  account  will  be  based  on  the  estimated  expenditures  for  3  months  or  $20,000, \nwhichever is less. The ceiling on the imprest account will be $50,000 and any individual \npayment will not exceed $10,000. The account will be established with BOL or a reputable \ncommercial bank acceptable to ADB. PIU will be responsible for ensuring proper accounting for \neligible expenditures incurred and paid out from the imprest account. PIU will also ensure that \nADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedure will be followed when liquidating and replenishing \nthe account. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n29.  BOL through the PIU will submit quarterly and semiannual progress reports to ADB to \nprovide information on the TA performance along with a review of bank performance targets. \nThe performance of IBAs will be closely monitored and specifically covered in the progress \nreports. BOL will ensure that the SOCBs have their accounts audited annually by independent \nand competent auditors acceptable to ADB, with signed audits submitted to ADB within 6 \nmonths of the end of the fiscal year. The audited financial statements will be in English and will \ninclude at a minimum income and expenditures, assets and liabilities, with the accompanying \nnotes to the accounts. BOL should also submit an audited financial report annually within 9 \nmonths of the end of the fiscal year. \n ", "    7 \n \n30.  When submission of audited financial statements is delayed by more than 12 months \nafter the due date, ADB can suspend loan disbursements. The PIU will submit to ADB, within 3 \nmonths of the Project's physical completion, a project completion report that will give the details \nof project implementation, costs, benefit monitoring and evaluation activities, and other relevant \ninformation. \n \n7.  Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n31.  The Government and ADB will closely monitor the implementation of the project through \nongoing review of the quarterly and semiannual progress reports and regular loan review \nmissions. ADB monitoring will include ongoing dialogue with the Government on the overall \neffectiveness of the Program and the TA loan in improving the financial sector. ADB will \nregularly review the progress of the proposed loan based on the Government\u2019s quarterly and \nsemiannual progress reports, participate in the regular reviews, and require agreement on any \nrevisions.  \n \n32.  ADB and the Government jointly will conduct a comprehensive midterm review within 18 \nmonths of the Project\u2019s start. The review will assess Government progress in implementing and \nadherence to procurement arrangements. From all the assessments, the midterm review will \nformulate, within the updated sector setting and other changing circumstances, the necessary \ncourses of action for the Government and ADB to ensure successful implementation and \neffectiveness in achieving the Project\u2019s objectives.  \n \n33.  The PIU will submit a detailed implementation plan for monitoring benefits and preparing \nbenchmark information for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence within 6 months of loan effectiveness. \nThe project performance monitoring system (PPMS) will be applied to each project component \nto ensure that project facilities are managed efficiently and benefits are realized. The PIU will \ndevelop a comprehensive set of indicators with a separate financed TA. The PIU will be \nresponsible for carrying out the PPMS activities, including establishing of benchmarks through \ninitial surveys, data collection, and analysis. Impacts to be measured are compliance with \nprocedures,  enhancement  of  governance  practices,  improved  cost  structures,  and  more \naccurate financial reporting and controls.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n34.  The  principal  benefit  of  the  Project  will  be  greater  transparency,  certainty,  and \npredictability  in  commercial  bank  transactions,  particularly  the  initiation  of  loans  and  the \nenforcement of loan and security obligations. Such a change will foster a better environment for \ncommercial transactions and support a stronger set of borrowers.  \n \n35.  A  second  benefit  is  support  for  macroeconomic  stability  and  poverty  reduction  by \nstrengthening the country\u2019s ability to grow without the attendant risk of banking-sector-instigated \nmacroinstability. The lower risk premium of lending rates will give a greater range of borrowers \naccess to loan financing. Moreover, reduced SOCB losses will enable the Government to focus \nits expenditures on reducing poverty. The channels for poverty reduction are described in \nAppendix 6. \n ", "8   \n36.  Another important long-term benefit will be the capacity for future development of the \ncommercial system built in to the SOCB management and staff. The project beneficiaries \ninclude  SOCB  management  and  staff,  their  potential  clients,  and  the  wider  range  of  the \npopulation, including the poor, who benefit from greater stability and economic growth. \n \nB.  Risks \n37.  The first risk is the potential re-emergence of macroeconomic instability, which would \nundermine the banking sector reform. These macroeconomic risks are being minimized through \nthe tightly monitored fiscal and monetary framework under the IMF\u2019s PRGF supported by \nbudget and state-owned enterprise reforms supported by the World Bank\u2019s FMAC. \n \n38.  Second,  resistance  from  defaulting  borrowers  and  other  former  beneficiaries  of \nnoncommercial banking activity, particularly in the provinces, could erode the political will to \nsustain the medium-term reform program. This risk is being mitigated by a program initiated \nmore than a year ago in which the Government achieved a sense of ownership and facilitated \nstrong  coordination  among  the  international  financial  institutions  (IFIs)  in  dialogue  and \ninstruments. This effort will continually strengthen throughout program implementation. \n \n39.  The third risk is that restructuring the SOCBs may result in redundancies and this could \nlead to resentment and grassroots resistance. Consultation and awareness building have begun \nand  will  continue  throughout  implementation.  The  Government,  in  consultation  with  the \nstakeholders and as agreed upon with ADB, has also committed that a mitigation plan will be an \nintegral  part  of  the  restructuring  program  should  the  program  have  adverse  effects  on \nvulnerable SOCB staff.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n40.  Within 30 days of loan effectiveness, the PIU will be established and its project director \nwill have been appointed. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n41.  I am satisfied that the proposed technical assistance loan would comply with the Articles \nof Agreement of ADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various currencies \nequivalent to Special Drawing Rights 3,024,000 to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for the \nBanking Sector Reform Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at \nthe rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 \nyears,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the \nBoard. \n \n \nTadao Chino \nPresident \n \n16 October 2002 \n ", "  Appendix 1  9 \n \nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nSummary  Indicators/Targets  and Risks \nGoal       \n       \nPromote sustainable  Increased depth in the  Official banking statistics  Political, MOF and BOL support \ngrowth through a sound  financial sector    for implementing SOCB \nfinancial sector    Quarterly SOCB financial  restructuring and NPL \n  Increased share of  statements verified through  resolution \nSubgoal  performing loans to  on-site examination reports   \n  private enterprises in loan    Stable macroeconomic \nTransform SOCBs into  portfolio  Annual audit covering  environment \nsustainable financial    operations and financial   \ninstitutions by ensuring  Improved operational and  statements  Improved framework and \noperations based on good  financial efficiency    environment for loan recoveries \ngovernance and the       \napplication of commercial  Improvement in CAMEL \nprinciples  based assessment of \n  financial soundness \nPurpose       \nStem recurring SOCB  Performance according to  Regular Banking Financial  Effective international banking \nlosses  commitments to be  Supervision Department on- advisors \n  agreed upon and the  site and off-site inspection   \nIntroduce and apply  governance agreement  reports   Full cooperation and support of \npolicies and procedures to      SOCB board, management and \nstrengthen governance  Agreed-upon qualitative  Annual audit covering  staff \nand accountability to all  performance indicators  operations and financial   \nlevels of the SOCB  relating to  statements   Cohesive management team \n  -

", "12  Appendix 2 \n \nTERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTING SERVICES \n \n1.  The TA loan will require 240 person-months of consulting services: 108 international and \n132 person-months of domestic consulting services. The international consultants will be two \nsenior international banking advisors (IBAs; 27 person-months each), and two operational IBAs \n(27 person-months each). The domestic Consultants (33 person-months each) will be a bi-\nlingual banking assistants assigned to the IBAs.  The IBAs will maintain, as a minimum, the \nsame working days and hours as the Lao bankers, but should be prepared to work on week-\nends, as needed to carryout their tasks effectively. The IBAs are expected to each spend nine-\nperson months a year. The schedule of residency in Lao PDR will be worked out in a manner \nthat, to the extent possible, there would always be at least an IBA in Vientiane, with the possible \nexception of the year-end holiday season. The Domestic Consultants will be in residence 12 \nmonths a year. Each team of 2 IBAs and 2 domestic consultants will be dedicated to one SOCB. \n \nA.  International Consultants  \n2.  The role of IBAs is to support the state-owned commercial bank (SOCB) restructuring \nprogram as outlined in the governance agreement for each SOCB agreed between the Ministry \nof Finance (MOF), the Bank of Lao PDR (BOL) and the board members and the managing \ndirector of each SOCB (both singularly and collectively). While the consultants will have neither \nline-management  responsibilities  nor  any  decision-making  rights,  they  will  have  mandated \nresponsibilities  to  develop  modern  banking  policies  and  implementation  systems  and \nprocedures that will allow Bank management to make commercially oriented banking decisions \nin the best interests of the bank. The governance agreement will be revised annually to reflect \nupdated performance targets and other factors, which may necessitate some minor refinements \nin the consultants\u2019 advisory responsibilities. \n \n3.  Initially, the SOCB will be operating under a restricted banking regime, codified in the \nInterim Operational Policies to be adopted on 1 January 2003. The IBAs\u2019 first tasks will be to (a) \nbecome familiar with key BOL regulations; (b) meet with and become familiar with the reporting \nand performance requirements for the banks and the BOL under the agreements entered into \nby the GOL; (c) conduct diagnostics of the Bank, which will build on diagnostics and audit \nreports already prepared; (d) put in place procedures to ensure early compliance with the \nInterim Operational Policies and checklists to document compliance that should enable the \nBank to meet its performance targets; and (e) assist the Bank to monitor and report on \ncompliance and performance to BOL. If diagnostics reveal specific activities necessary to \nachieve the performance targets, the consultants should recommend any required steps in \nwriting to the managing director and the board members with copies to BOL, MOF and the \ninternational financial institutions (IFIs). Once these early diagnostics are completed and the \ninterim policies are operational, the IBAs will develop a work plan for the remainder of the first \nyear that should encompass obtaining board approved policies for the principal banking areas \nand development of initial restructuring and business plans (RBPs). In the first year, the RBP \nshould focus on operational improvements, organizational and branch rationalization, human \nresource development (HRD) and upgrading, and information technology (IT).   \n \n4.  In the initial operational phase, the IBAs will concentrate on stopping loss making activity \nin two areas: the speed and quality of resolving nonperforming loans (NPLs) and the amount \nand quality of new risk activity (on and off balance sheet) under interim operational policies. This \ntask will require the IBAs to recommend policies, organizational structures and operational \nsystems, and procedures for a dedicated NPL collection unit. The unit will report monthly on its \nprogress in NPL collections and prepare a number of cases for mediation and court resolution in \n ", "  Appendix 2  13 \nthe first year. As part of the HRD program all bank officers should be required to have some \nexposure to the processes involved in NPL collection. \n \n1.  Scope of Advisory Services \n5.  As mandated under the governance agreement, the IBAs are to  provide commercial \nbank advisory services in major areas of banking activities in the Lao PDR. This will involve \ndeveloping policies for board approval and, providing the necessary policy implementation \nassistance in terms of (i) establishing the needed delegation of authority, (ii) formulating the \nrequired systems and procedures, (iii) confirming the assignment of responsibilities, (iv) training \nand  mentoring  in  applying  policies,  and  (v)  monitoring  policy  implementation.  Bank  officer \nresponsibility will be enhanced by having every officer acting on a file or other action to sign \nrelative  to  the  proposed  action  or  recommendation  and  making  all  those \nactions/recommendations and the full file with signatures subject to review by higher bank \nofficials and ultimately by the board members for decisions requiring board approval. \n \n6.  The IBAs will work directly with the SOCB, but cooperate fully with the BOL and MOF. A \nkey aspect of IBAs\u2019 tasks is monitoring key decision-making areas to ensure compliance with \ncommercial banking standards and procedures, particularly interim operational policies under \nthe restricted banking regime and with an initial focus on loss making activity. Specifically, in the \ncredit  approval  process  relative  to  all  large  loan  proposals,  the  IBAs  will,  prior  to  formal \nconsideration and approval by the SOCBs, review the files to ascertain that the procedural \naspects of the credit approval process are being fully respected relative to each proposed credit. \nWhen  the  loan  proposal  is  in  full  procedural  compliance  and  meets  sound  commercial \nunderwriting criteria, the IBA will issue a \u201ccompliance certification\u201d finding on the file relative to \nits further processing for approval. The underwriting criteria will include measures and analysis \ndemonstrating adequate cash flow to cover debt service and adequate collateral as a secondary \nsource of repayment. The compliance certification will distinguish clearly between a judgement \nregarding procedural compliance from the assessment of the underwriting criteria. Where there \nare deficiencies in either procedural compliance or underwriting criteria, written comments on \nthe shortcoming in each category are to be made available to all relevant parties and included in \nthe file for review by management or the board  of directors, should that loan proposal be \nbrought for approval.  \n \n7.  In  addition  to  developing,  implementing  and  monitoring  the  application  of  board \napproved banking policies, the international consultants will develop and revise annually the \nRBPs that will encompass (i) operational plans, (ii) NPL resolution, (iii) organizational and \nbranch rationalization plans, (iv) HRD plans, (v) fixed asset plans, (vi) technology plans, and (vii) \nfinancial and capital-build up plans.  \n \n8.  The IBAs will strongly emphasize the training and mentoring aspects of the assistance to \nmanagement.  On-the-job  training  will  be  complemented  with  formal  course  work  and \nscholarships. It is anticipated that the formal training and scholarships will take place in 2003/04 \nunder the European Union Bank Training Project and the study tour will begin in 2004. \n \n2.  Qualifications Scope of Advisory Services \n9.  The IBAs should have leadership, technical, and coaching skills, with a demonstrated \nprofessional  track  record  in  banking.  The  IBAs  are  expected  to  be  fully  equipped  with \ndocumented governance policies, systems and procedures obtained from previous experience \nor their affiliated firms. They will adapt these policies, systems, and procedures so as to assist in ", "14  Appendix 2 \n \nattaining performance indicators under this governance agreement. The IBAs will bring their \nown computer notebook for the engagement. \n \n10.  The senior IBA should have \n \ni.  at least 5 years of varied experience in top or senior management positions in a \nreputable international banks, of which 3 years were spend in an oversight role \nfor  major  banking  functions,  particularly  in  credit  approval  and  asset-liability \nmanagement functions; \nii.  professional experience of at least 5 years in emerging economies; \niii.  leadership skills including: (a) a clear vision of the Bank at the end of the \nrestructuring period; (b) an understanding of the key elements and processes \nrequired  for  the  successful  turnaround  of  the  Bank;  and  (c)  the  ability  to \novercome constraints posed by the local environment, as well as sensitivity to \ncultural and political considerations; \niv.  specialized skills in several of the major areas of bank management, including  \ncredit  risk  management,  asset/liability  management,  international  banking, \nbranch banking,  operations, legal practices, accounting or audit and human \nresource management; \nv.  demonstrated interpersonal skills, with the ability and interest to effectively coach \nLao PDR bank officers; \nvi.  appropriate university degree; \nvii.  ability to interface with high-level officials; and \nviii.  excellent command of written and spoken English. Knowledge of the Lao or Thai \nlanguage would be an advantage. \n11.  The operational IBA should have  \n \ni.  at least 10 years\u2019 experience in management for reputable international banks, of \nwhich at least 3 years were as a senior officer  supervising a major functional \narea;  \nii.  professional experience, with at least 5 years in emerging economies; \niii.  specialized skills in several of the major areas of bank management, including \ncredit  risk  management,  asset/liability  management,  international  banking, \nbranch  banking,  operations,  legal  practices,  accounting  or  audit  and  human \nresource management;  \niv.  demonstrated interpersonal skills with the ability and interest to effectively coach \nLao PDR bank officers; \nv.  skills that complement the skills of the senior IBA;  \nvi.  appropriate university degree; and \nvii.  excellent command of written and spoken English.  Knowledge of the Lao or Thai \nlanguage would be an advantage. \n \n3.  Collective Terms of Reference for the IBAs \n12.  The IBAs will work in teams of two, with each team comprising a senior and operational \nIBA. Collectively, they will assist Bank management to attain the objectives in the governance \nagreement of developing and implementing the Bank\u2019s operational policies and RBPs, thereby \n ", "  Appendix 2  15 \nturning  the  Bank  around  operationally  and  financially.  They  will  assist  and  advise  Bank \nmanagement to develop and implement the restructuring business plans (RBPs) relating to \noperations,  NPL  resolution,  organization  and  branch  rationalization,  human  resource \ndevelopment (HRD), fixed asset rationalization, technology development, and financial and \ncapital build-up. \n \n13.  The IBAs will prepare comprehensive operational policies for board approval in the \nareas of credit, asset/liability policies, portfolio management, accounting, foreign exchange \ntransactions, delegation of authority, and HRD policies. Priorities will be policies necessary to \nstop loss making activity (NPL resolution and new risk activity, on and off balance sheet).  \nAdditional consulting services in areas such as IT, NPLs and HRD policies and training under \nrelated programs will be available to assist the IBAs in these tasks and will need to be \ncoordinated by the IBAs.  While these comprehensive operational policies are being developed, \nthe IBAs will review, assist, and coach relative to the implementation of the interim policies. \nDuring the initial phase of Bank restructuring, the IBAs will also develop the details of the \nturnaround  plans  that  are  integral  parts  of  the  RBPs,  in  close  collaboration  with  Bank \nmanagement. The RBPs are the strategies or road maps, embodied in one single set of \ndocuments, which would enable the state-owned commercial banks to attain the objectives of \nbanking sector restructuring. The turnaround plans are components of the RBPs that will have \nto be separately fleshed out, depending on the turnaround plan. The major elements of the \nRBPs will also be subject to the approval of the Boards of the respective Bank, MOF, BOL, and \nIFIs. During the initial phase, the IBAs will be required to conduct bank-wide training and \nworkshops to explain the importance of the turnaround plans and the new operational policies, \nand how to effectively implement them. \n \n14.  With respect to the periodic performance targets, the IBAs will assist Bank management \nto ensure compliance  and to prepare the requisite data and the self-assessment required. \nSpecifically, in the assessment of senior staff members, including branch managers the IBAs \nwill provide the basic guidelines which will include observance of the approved operational \npolicies, effective implementation of the RBPs and the contribution in meeting the performance \ntargets.  \n \n15.  In the light of the limited commercial orientation and bank management skills in the Lao \nbanks, the IBAs will play a pro-active role in actively advising in relation to the business and \noperations of the Bank. In the process, on-the-job training will be offered and augmented to the \nextent possible through workshops on specialized banking topics and formal training  in related \nprograms - accounting processes and financial reports, internal auditing, and credit appraisal \nusing commercial criteria. The workshops will be extended to include the Bank\u2019s corporate \nclients, especially relative to the use of the standard financial reporting template that will be \nadopted. The key task of the IBAs is to coach their Lao counterparts in the banks while making \nclear recommendations and identifying deficiencies in operational procedures. Assisting bank \nstaff to eliminate such deficiencies is a key role of the IBAs and one that best enhances staff \ndevelopment. \n  \n16.  The  IBAs\u2019  advice  should  aim  to  encourage  the  Bank  to  maintain  high  commercial \nstandards in all key areas. As required in the governance agreement, the IBAs will: \n \ni.  provide bank-wide advice to the managing director and other member of senior \nmanagement to enable them to ", "16  Appendix 2 \n \na.  stop loss-making activity under the Interim Operational Policies and assist \nthe Bank monitor and report on compliance according to the reporting \nformats agreed with BOL; \n \nb.  continuously review the comprehensive operational policies and exercise \nproactive leadership in applying these policies; \nii.  apply the requisite technical, analytical and decision-making skills to effectively \nimplement the Bank\u2019s operational policies and the RBPs; \niii.  attend  the  meetings  of  the  board,  board  committees,  and  management \ncommittees; \niv.  guide the board/committee secretary in preparing meeting agenda and minutes \nof all meetings of the board, committees of the board, and Management;  \nv.  review all loan proposal files for the loan committee and the board of directors \nand,  where  the  recommended  policies  and  procedures  and  commercial \nunderwriting criteria have been fully complied, issue a signed \u201cno objection\u201d to \nfurther processing of the loan proposal.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national      Yes  Sector identified as a national priority               Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?  in country poverty partnership agreement?  \nPoverty in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (PDR), as in most neighboring countries, is concentrated in the \nrural areas. According to the most recently prepared estimates for 1997-98,1 22.1% of the urban population and \n42.5% of the rural population (39.1% of the total population) were poor. Since 83.3% of the population resided in rural \nareas in 1997-98, these estimates imply that 91% of the poor reside in the rural areas. Within the rural areas, the \npoor reside in relatively remote villages, tend to be illiterate or poorly educated, own or have access to limited land \nand other assets, depend largely on subsistence farming both for employment and as a source of income, and live in \nrelatively large households with relatively high dependency burdens. \n \nRecently prepared poverty estimates suggest that the poor have benefited from rapid economic growth taking place \nbefore the economic crises in 1997. Overall, the poor population declined at an annual rate of 3.1% between 1993 \nand 1998. However, reductions in poverty have been geographically uneven and urban-rural disparities are widening. \nIn particular, those who live outside the monetized economy (i.e., most of the rural poor) have not been able to \nparticipate in the benefits of economic growth. The banking sector\u2019s contribution to poverty reduction in Lao PDR. \n \nEstimates suggest that in order for the government to reach its poverty reduction goals, economic growth needs to be \nat least 7%.  A sound financial sector \u2013 in this case dominated by the state-owned banks \u2013 will be an indispensable \npart of this growth rate, as growth is directly linked to a deepening in the financial sector. Further, the soundness of \nbanks reflects the general confidence level in the system and can provide the needed price and exchange stability for \nthe real economy to expand in a sustainable and broad-based manner.     \n \nThe banking system is also an important channel through which domestic savings are allocated to support the good \nprojects in the private sector, particularly small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs). Currently, many businesses \nsuffer from limited access to commercial credit, and the development of the private sector will benefit from the \nincreased availability of appropriately priced financial products, which in turn, will encourage employment creation \nassociated with the expected growth of SMEs. \n \nOn a more fundamental level, an overall effective financial system can provide services that are equally available to \nthe urban and rural population, the financially well-off and the poor.  Expansion of the financial sector, particularly in \nthe Lao PDR, is a key requirement for a more equitable distribution of the benefits from rising growth rates and a \nmore robust business sector. Efforts to reach out to all regions and facilitate access to credit on commercial terms will \nbe critical to narrowing the gap in the Lao PDR. Improving access to financial services will boost widespread \nproductivity growth and employment creation. \n \nIn the Lao PDR, there are five main channels by which banking system reform can contribute to further poverty \nreduction: \nMacroeconomic stability and economic growth \nFiscal space \nDistribution of income and wealth \nEmployment creation \nExtension of sustainable financial services \n1   Nanak Kakwani, Gaurav Datt, Bounthavy Siousphanhthong, Phonesaly Souksavath, and Limin Wang. 2002. \n\u201cPoverty in Lao PDR During the 1990s,\u201d Revised May 31,2002.

Further, given the current lack of investments in areas such as rural infrastructure, education, and \nhealth, improvement in bank performance frees fiscal resources to provide a much-needed boost in the social portion \nof the budget. Lastly, increased confidence in the banking system and enhanced macrostability can be expected to \nlead, in turn, to a lower risk premium on domestic financial assets (lowering the costs of borrowing), increased \ndomestic savings, increased foreign investment, significantly diminished pressures on the Lao currency and a \nreduced risk of a fiscal and monetary crisis.

In the medium \nterm, with lower costs of financial services and price levels, the poor\u2019s access to credit and asset accumulation will \nalso improve.   \nImpact on rural areas \nAlong with the inaccessibility to credit to the poor, there is also a significant urban/rural divide.  Because the current \nbanking system is inefficient and biased toward urban areas, it creates substantial obstacles for the development of \nrural finance. Reform in the banking system may increase the supply of credit to rural households. The program\u2019s \nobjective is, among others, to develop a more diversified and commercial-oriented rural credit system. This should \nhelp accelerate economic growth and expand employment opportunities and thereby improve the distribution of \nincome and wealth in the rural areas. \nC.
