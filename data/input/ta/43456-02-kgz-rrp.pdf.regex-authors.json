THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Kyrgyz Republic for the Power Sector Improvement \nProject.1  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n2.  Years of neglect since independence have left the Kyrgyz power sector in a state of \ndisrepair. Facilities are dilapidated, losses are high, tariffs are below cost-recovery, and financial \nperformance is poor. The power sector needs an urgent overhaul before the functionality of the \nsystem is lost. It needs to improve energy efficiency, energy security, and regional power trade. \nThe proposed project is critical to attaining these goals. \n \n3.  The  Kyrgyz  Republic  has  abundant  hydropower  resources.  Over  95%  of  energy \ngenerated  comes  from  hydropower  plants  (HPPs).  Of  the  total  installed  capacity  of \n3,713 megawatts (MW), 2,950 MW (79.5%) is HPPs and 763 MW (20.5%) is combined heat \nand power plants. While the Kyrgyz Republic is the largest net power exporter of the Central \nAsian Power System (CAPS) by exporting surplus hydropower during summer, load shedding is \nfrequent during winter when the river discharge is low. Such a supply pattern calls for regional \npower trade. \n \n4.  Reliable supply is also hindered by (i) high system losses (6% transmission loss and \n26%  distribution  loss  in  2009),  (ii)  inefficient  system  operation  using  obsolete  technology, \n(iii) faults caused by dilapidated equipment used since the Soviet era, and (iv) poor governance \nand financial management. These factors also reduce power exports. Since export revenue is \nused to import costly fuel for combined heat and power plants in winter, reduced summer export \nleads to insufficient domestic supply in winter. \n \n5.  Since nearly 60% of electricity consumption is residential, the performance of the power \nsector directly affects the population. The people\u2019s uprising of April 2010 was partly fuelled by \npublic anger over the nontransparent manner in which the tariff was doubled in January 2010 \ndespite poor supply. Power sector reform that involved unbundling of the vertically integrated \nutility2 in 2001 was expected to boost transparency and efficiency. However, the sector remains \nin poor condition even after a decade. It is now perceived that the recommended industry \nstructure may not have been suitable for the Kyrgyz Republic. That there are four distribution \ncompanies to supply just over 1 million customers is seen as an obstacle to better sector \nperformance.  \n \n6.  While the entire power sector needs to be modernized, the government places top \npriority on loss reduction and more effective governance. This is not only necessary to improve \ncommercial  operations,  but  to  regain  people\u2019s  confidence  in  the  power  sector and  ensure \nstability. To achieve this, the government issued a presidential decree known as the \u201cFuel and \nEnergy Sector Transparency Initiative\u201d on 20 July 2010. Energy security through expansion of \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The vertically integrated power company, KyrgyzEnergo, was unbundled into (i) Electric Power Plant Company \n(generating company), (ii) National Electric Grid of Kyrgyzstan (transmission company), and (iii) four distribution \ncompanies each responsible for a geographic area. ", "2 \ngenerating  capacity  is  also  a  priority,  but  the  short-term  solutions  are  to  improve  system \nefficiency and reliability, and to increase regional power trade. The strategic vision of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for the Kyrgyz power sector is fully aligned with the government\u2019s \nown strategy. The proposed project has the following components: \n \n(i)  Automated metering and data acquisition system. The automated metering \nand  data  acquisition  system  (AMDA)  will  bring  transparency  to  wholesale \nelectricity transactions between the unbundled power companies, and to regional \npower trade. AMDA will eliminate errors and rampant manipulation of metering \ndata,  which  are  impossible  to  trace  with  the  current  archaic  technology. \nCommercial loss is estimated at 40% of total system loss. Loss reduction will \nmake more power available domestically and improve the financial performance \nof the utilities. Accurate data is crucial to improving commercial performance. \nAMDA will also support regional power trade through (a) meeting the CAPS \nmetering accuracy requirement, and (b) eliminating unauthorized exports. \n \n(ii)  Substation rehabilitation. Replacing dilapidated circuit breakers and instrument \ntransformers  that  have  reached  their  economic  lives,  are  technologically \nobsolete, or do not meet the accuracy requirement for regional power trade will \nimprove the reliability of the system. Since the Kyrgyz system is interconnected \nwith the CAPS, rehabilitation increases reliability of the regional system that \nunderpins regional power trade. \n \n(iii)  Communications and supervisory control and data acquisition system. This \ncomponent will link seven major substations (estimated) and the control centers \nvia optical fiber, enabling the system operator to dispatch more efficiently based \non real-time data. The supervisory control and data acquisition system (SCADA) \nwill reduce technical losses by avoiding overload, and enable faster detection \nand repair of faults. The system improves overall efficiency and reliability of \nKyrgyz power supply and the CAPS. \n \n(iv)  Study on the settlement mechanism for wholesale electricity transactions. \nThe objective is to look at the settlement system, and to recommend actions that \nadvance transparency and accountability, and to maximize the benefits of AMDA. \nThe component will devise mechanisms to improve the commercial performance \nof the utilities, and to streamline contractual and settlement arrangements for \nregional power trade.  \n \n(v)  Corporate  and  financial  management  capacity  building  for  the  National \nElectric Grid of Kyrgyzstan (NEGK).3 This will improve corporate management \nof the transmission company through the preparation of a corporate business \nplan,  including  the  review  of  investment  needs,  operation  and  maintenance \npractices, organizational reforms, internal control, asset revaluation, and cost of \ntransmission  service.  Financial  management  capacity  will  be  strengthened \nthrough the application of the International Financial Reporting Standards and \nappropriate corporate accounting software.  \n \n                                                 \n3  NEGK is an open joint stock company established under the laws of the Kyrgyz Republic. The government holds \n93.7% of the shares; the rest is traded on the Kyrgyz Stock Exchange and the Central Asian Stock Exchange. \n ", "3 \n7.  The project fits with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 and ADB\u2019s Energy Policy.4 The latter focuses \non  energy  efficiency,  cutting  fossil  fuel  use,  energy  security,  energy  access,  and  regional \ncooperation. The project also promotes capacity development and governance. It is aligned with \nthe government's Country Development Strategy 2009\u20132011,5 which places high priority on the \nenergy  sector.  The  Joint  Country  Support  Strategy  2007\u20132010, 6  prepared  by  major \ndevelopment partners and ADB, supports the Country Development Strategy. Although the \nenergy sector was initially assigned to other donors, ADB decided to reengage in the sector to \ncontribute to the large financing need. The project forms part of the energy strategy agreed \nunder the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The project will boost energy security, energy efficiency, and regional power trade. The \nimpact will be stronger reliability of the national and regional power systems in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic and Central Asia. The outcome will be higher operational efficiency of the utilities. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n  1.  Physical \n \n9.  The  AMDA  will  be  a main  output.  It  will  allow  obtaining  commercial  metering  data \nautomatically from (i) about 190 substations of NEGK, and (ii) facilities of the Electric Power \nPlant  Company 7  with  direct  supply  to  distribution  companies  and  interconnections  with \nneighboring countries. A second output will be the rehabilitation of circuit breakers, and current \nand voltage transformers in over 50 selected substations of NEGK. A third output will be the \nSCADA that links seven major NEGK substations (estimated) and control centers. \n \n  2.  Nonphysical \n \n10.  The  main  outputs  will  be:  (i)  project  management  of  physical  investments; \n(ii) recommendations  on  the  settlement  mechanism  for  wholesale  electricity  transactions \nincluding  the  industry  structure;  and  (iii)  development  of  NEGK's  corporate  and  financial \nmanagement capacities, and strategic business planning. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n11.  The project is estimated to cost $56 million (Table 1). \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2008.

The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR \n11,010,000 and a grant not exceeding $28.1 million, both from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \n(i.e., Asian Development Fund [ADF]), to help finance the project.  The loan will have a 32-year \nterm, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter; and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the \ndraft financing and project agreements. ADB will finance a total of $44.8 million equivalent. The \ngovernment will allocate $1.5 million to the Ministry of Energy (MOE) for advisory services on a \nwholesale settlement mechanism and NEGK\u2019s capacity building. The remaining $43.3 million \nwill be relent to NEGK to fund capital investment and project management. The relending is for \na 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, and an interest rate of 1.5% per annum. \nForeign exchange risk will be borne by NEGK. The government and NEGK will contribute $11.2 \nmillion to the project (Table 2). The government will either (i) allocate additional funds from the \nbudget to cover value-added tax and custom duties accrued on project expenditures, or (ii) \nexempt  the  project  from  such  taxes  and  duties,  in  which  case  the  amount  exempted  will \nconstitute  government  counterpart  financing.  Detailed  cost  estimates  are  in  the  project \nadministration manual (PAM).8  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of Total \nSource \n($ million)  (%) \nADB \u2013 ADF  44.8a  80.0 \nGovernment/NEGK  11.2  20.0 \nTotal  56.0  100.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund, NEGK = National Electric Grid of Kyrgyzstan. \na \n$28.1 million (62.7%) is ADF grant, and $16.7 million (37.3%) is ADF loan. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n                                                 \n8  Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  The project has two executing agencies: MOE and NEGK. MOE is responsible for \n(i) managing  the  study  on  a  settlement  mechanism  for  wholesale  electricity  transactions, \n(ii) managing the capacity-building advisory service for NEGK, and (iii) supervising NEGK's \nproject implementation performance.  \n \n14.  NEGK  is  responsible  for  managing  the  capital  investment.  A  procurement  capacity \nassessment revealed that the country procurement system is weak and NEGK\u2019s capacity is also \nlimited. The existing project implementation unit (PIU) will oversee the execution of the capital \ninvestment, but project management will be outsourced to an international consulting firm to \nassist  NEGK.  Its  task  will  include  outline  design,  preparation  of  bidding  documents,  bid \nevaluation, contract award, construction supervision, accounting, safeguard monitoring, and \nreporting to the government and ADB. Contractors\u2019 contracts will have fixed prices and fixed \ndelivery periods, with premiums and penalties on performance and quality. The implementation \narrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2010-December 2013 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2013 \nManagement   \n(i)   Executing agency \u2013 1  Ministry of Energy \n(ii)  Executing agency \u2013 2   National Electric Grid of Kyrgyzstan \n   \nAmount \nProcurement  Method  Contracts \n($ million) \n(i)  Plant \u2013 design, supply, and install contract for  ICB  1  17.0 \nAMDA and SCADA systems and \ncommunications \n(ii)  Goods for substation rehabilitation equipmenta  ICB  1  18.0 \n       \nAmount \nConsulting services  Method  Contracts \n($ million) \n(i)  Project management (firm; 196 person-months)  QCBS  1  2.8b \n(ii)  NEGK capacity development (firm; 54 person- QCBS  1  1.0c \nmonths) \n(iii) Settlement mechanism study (firm; 24 person- QCBS  1  0.5 \nmonths) \n       \nAdvance contracting  Consulting services \n   \nDisbursement  The loan and grant proceeds will be disbursed in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time) \nand detailed arrangements agreed upon between \nthe government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, AMDA = automated metering and data acquisition system, ICB = international \ncompetitive bidding, NEGK = National Electric Grid of Kyrgyzstan, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection, SCADA \n= supervisory control and data acquisition system. \na\n  Installation by NEGK. \nb\n  Including procurement of project management software.

ADB conducted technical due diligence on the proposed investments and is satisfied \nwith the rationale, technical specifications, quantities, and cost estimates. The AMDA is a critical \ntechnology that brings transparency to the wholesale electricity market, and helps reduce loss \nand boost efficiency in commercial operations. The SCADA is a standard modern utility practice \nconsidered appropriate to improve NEGK\u2019s system operations. The obsolete circuit breakers \nand instrument transformers need to be replaced with modern equipment to avoid collapse of \nthe power system. ADB has confirmed that NEGK has experience in successfully installing and \ncommissioning  similar  types  of  equipment  as  to  be  procured  under  the  project.  Stronger \nreliability will improve energy security and boost regional power trade. The AMDA and SCADA \nare a technological step change from the current practice. Training will be included in the project \nmanagement  consultants\u2019  terms  of  reference  and  contractors\u2019  contracts.  The  contracts  will \ninclude sufficient spare parts, support service, and quality and performance warranties. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n16.  A  financial  analysis  has  been  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Financial \nManagement and Analysis of Projects.9 All financial costs and benefits have been expressed at \nconstant 2009 prices. Cost streams used to determine the financial internal rate of return\u2014\ncapital investment and operations and maintenance\u2014reflect the cost of delivering the estimated \nbenefits. The financial internal rate of return is 7.83%, which compares favorably with the \nweighted average cost of capital (0.65%). Financial viability was gauged by comparing the \nincremental costs and benefits in \"with project\" and \"without project\" investment scenarios. The \nincremental benefits come from fewer outages, fewer technical and commercial losses, and \nmore domestic and international sales.  \n \n17.  The economic viability takes into account streams of costs and benefits resulting from \nthe project. Regional economic benefits are not included in the economic internal rate of return \ncalculations since they accrue to countries other than the Kyrgyz Republic.  Other unquantifiable \nbenefits are lower operation and maintenance costs, more efficient dispatch based on reliable \nreal-time data and historical data, better water management at Toktogul HPP through loss \nreduction. The economic internal rate of return is 24.41%, which compares favorably with the \n12% opportunity cost of capital.10  \n \nC.  Governance \n \n18.  ADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and NEGK. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. ADF grant and loan funds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \n19.  A  financial  management  assessment  including  risk  management  assessment  was \nprepared in accordance with ADB guidelines. A procurement capacity assessment was also \nconducted.  Similar  to  the  country\u2019s  weak  public  financial  management,  NEGK\u2019s  financial \nmanagement capabilities are also weak. Internal control is lacking, and adherence to accounting \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n10  Financial and Economic Analyses (Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nstandards,  disclosure,  and  auditing  requirement  is  insufficient.  Building  up  financial \nmanagement capabilities, corporate business planning, and development of human resources is \ncritical to improving corporate performance. \n \n20.  To bolster the corporate and financial management capacities of NEGK and to ensure \ngovernance in project-related activities, the project will include the following measures: \n \n(i)  strengthening the existing PIU and maintaining separate project accounts; \n(ii)  outsourcing project management to an international consulting firm; \n(iii)  establishing  a  direct  payment  procedure  and/or  commitment  procedure  for \ndisbursements to contractors and consultants; \n(iv)  having the project accounts audited by an external auditor; and    \n(v)  contracting consultants to develop NEGK's corporate and financial management \ncapacities,  introduce  the  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards,  and \nprepare a corporate business plan. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n21.  The general population will benefit from a transparent, accountable, and efficient power \nsector. Since the rural poor are the first to be cut off from supply during winter power shortages, \nsystem loss reduction and stronger supply reliability will particularly benefit the poor and the \nsocially  excluded.  Advisory  services  funded  by  the  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment will promote the establishment of an escrow account to ensure that revenue from \npower exports in summer will be used to purchase fuel for stable domestic power supply in \nwinter.  The  project\u2019s  advisory  service  on  a  settlement  mechanism  for  wholesale  electricity \ntransactions will support efforts by the United States Agency for International Development.  \n \n22.  The investments take place in existing substations and transmission lines. There are no \nadverse social impacts except nominal crop compensation during installation of optical ground \nwire (OPGW) at the existing transmission towers. Since the investments only require minimal \ncivil works, an influx of workers is not expected.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n23.  The geographic coverage is national. Physical investments are limited to (i) installing \nmeters  and  equipment  in  existing  substations,  and  (ii)  stringing  OPGW  over  existing \ntransmission towers and laying underground optical fiber cables under public roads in urban \nareas. An environmental and social safeguard specialist will be hired. \n \n24.  Environment category B. An initial environmental examination has been prepared in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).11 The major anticipated impact on \nthe  environment  will  come  from  the  disposal  of  electrical  equipment.  The  environmental \nmonitoring  and  management  plan  of  the  initial  environmental  examination  requires  the \ntransformer oils to be treated in NEGK's oil treatment facility and reused. An official inventory on \nusage of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) does not exist. The environmental monitoring and \nmanagement plan provides guidance on PCB testing, and handling and disposal procedures in \ncase it is identified. The project will work closely with the new \u201cManagement and Disposal of \nPCBs in Kyrgyzstan\u201d project of the United Nations Development Programme, which is the first of \nits kind in the Kyrgyz Republic. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF ), a potent greenhouse gas, will be used \n6\n                                                 \n11 Initial Environmental Examination (Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nin the new gas-insulated circuit breakers, but in small amounts. The contractor will be instructed \nto handle SF  in accordance with international best practice. \n6\n \n25.  Involuntary resettlement category B. Project investments will be implemented mostly \nin  existing  substations  where  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR)  impacts  are  not \nenvisaged. Work space and access is required only for stringing OPGW over the existing \ntransmission towers to develop a modern communication system. The towers are mostly on \nfarmland.  Very  limited  temporary  LAR  impact  such  as  crop  losses  during  installation  is \nexpected. Since the exact location of the work space can only be identified during detailed \ndesign and temporary works planning by the turnkey contractor, a LAR framework has been \nprepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  Operations  Manual \nF1/OP.12 The LAR framework has been disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. The turnkey contractor\u2019s \ncontract  will  explicitly  state  that  a LAR  plan  must  be  drafted  by  the  turnkey  contractor  in \naccordance with the LAR framework. The LAR plan will be finalized by the PIU and project \nmanagement consultants, and submitted to ADB for endorsement. On-site installation works \nshall not begin until the endorsed LAR plan is fully implemented. \n \n26.  Indigenous  peoples  category  C.  The project is not expected to affect indigenous \npeoples as defined under ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement. The project covers most of the \ncountry. The majority of the population is Kyrgyz; ethnic minorities comprise Kazakhs, Russians, \nand Uzbeks. These ethnic groups do not differ in their needs or levels of power supply, and all \nwill benefit equally from the project. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n27.  Technologies adopted under the project conform to international standards and best \npractices that are commercially proven and widely used across the world.
