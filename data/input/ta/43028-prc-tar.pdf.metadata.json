INTRODUCTION \n1.  At the request of the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) during the PRC \ncountry  programming  mission  in  December  2008,  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Strengthening \nEquitable Provision of Public Employment Services in Sichuan Province1 was included in the 2009 \nnonlending program of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). ADB undertook a TA fact-finding mission \nin November 2009. Agreement was reached with the government, including the Ministry of Finance \nand  Sichuan  provincial  bureaus,  on  the  TA\u2019s  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  costs  and  financing, \nimplementation arrangements, and outline terms of reference for consulting services. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  As a result of rapid socioeconomic development in the PRC, the profile of the country's labor \nmarket and employment has become more complex. Major challenges include integration of the \ncurrent urban\u2013rural dual system,2 increased numbers of migrant workers, surplus labor in rural areas, \nstrong demand for skilled labor, and provision of increased employment in the private sector. In the \n11th  Five-Year  Plan  2006\u20132010,  the  government  stresses  the  need  to  further  strengthen  the \nmanagement of social programs and the functions of various public services including the public \nemployment service (PES) in order to achieve related plan targets set for 2010.3 \n \n3.  Over the past two decades, an estimated 120 million workers in the PRC have migrated from \nrural to urban areas in search of better employment and income opportunities, and ADB has provided \nTA 4858 for Employment Services for Migrant Workers.4 However, rural\u2013urban migration is continuing \nat a fast pace, and an estimated 10 million workers are expected to migrate from the countryside each \nyear during the 11th five-year program period in search of employment in urban areas. While they \nhave made a significant contribution to economic growth in key urban areas, this massive influx of \nmigrant workers, most with limited employable skills and education, or even basic urban survival skills, \nhas raised a large number of employment-related and social issues. The PES system, which has \nexpanded nationwide, provides fundamental and comprehensive services to promote labor security. \nMore specifically, it (i) provides legal advice to laborers about their rights and benefits, (ii) brokers jobs, \n(iii)  provides  labor  market  information  and  analysis,  (iv)  administers  unemployment  benefits,  (v) \nprovides vocational and skills training, and (vi) offers special support to disadvantaged populations. \n \n4.  Since the late 1990s, the government has made significant efforts to develop a modernized \nPES system supported by a number of policy instruments.5 In response to strong socioeconomic \ndemand, as well as changing labor and employment environments in the PRC, the efficiency and \neffectiveness of the PES need to be improved. A better PES system is expected to facilitate a more \norderly and effective rural\u2013urban migration, which in turn will contribute to balanced development by \nbridging  the  gap  between  rural  and  urban  areas  and  between  more  affluent  coastal  and  less-\ndeveloped central and western regions. Challenges include strengthening institutional arrangements, \nand increasing capacity and resources at various levels. \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 18 November 2009. \n2  The PRC has been, for a long time, a dual society with an overt socioeconomic line drawn between the urban and rural \nsectors. This division was introduced under the planned economy to facilitate overall public administration, including areas \nsuch as policy setting, provision of social services, and access to employment opportunities. \n3 These include (i) new jobs created for urban residents reaching 45 million in 5 years, and (ii) the number of rural laborers \ntransferred to non-agriculture sectors reaching 45 million in 5 years.  \n4  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to the People's Republic of China for Employment Services for Migrant Workers. Manila \n(TA 4858\u2013PRC, for $300,000, approved on 27 October). \n5  Regulation of Labor Market Management 2000, Employment Promotion Law 2008, and Regulations on Employment \nService and Employment Management 2008. \n ", "2   \n5.  Located in the southwest of the PRC, Sichuan is the third most populated province with a \npopulation of 88 million (as of the end of 2007), of which around 4.2 million are ethnic minorities. It is a \nlarge agricultural province, with around 34 million rural employed laborers and almost 13 million urban \nemployed  laborers  (73%  and  27%  respectively).  Sichuan  was  one  of  the  most  heavily  affected \nprovinces by the Wenchuan earthquake that took place on 12 May 2008. The earthquake had a \ndevastating impact on the delivery of all social services in Sichuan, where it is reported that PES \nestablishments sustained significant damage. The urgent and most significant need is not only to \nrehabilitate the PES infrastructure, but also to strengthen the soft aspects (i.e., policies, institutional \ncapacity) of employment service delivery and to promote an equitable development of these services \nin rural and urban areas. The current global economic recession also emphasizes the need to develop \na  responsive  and  equitable  PES  system  that  supports  national  policies  of  shifting  to  a  more \nsustainable growth model. \n \n6.  Sichuan's  rural  migrant  workers  tend  to  engage  in  cyclic  migration  with  an  average \nemployment time of 8 months and an average monthly salary of CNY790. Further, findings of the \nADB-funded TA revealed that around 80% of migrant labor in Sichuan found their jobs through \ninformal networks (friends, family, and people from the same place). While much attention has been \ngiven to public employment services, the role of informal employment networks and local civil society \norganizations needs to be further understood and taken into consideration. The socioeconomic profile \nof Sichuan's rural migrant workers is changing, revealing generational differences in migrant labor. \nWhile previously farmers left for unskilled work, recent migrants have new aspirations given increased \neducational opportunities. According to the 2006 survey data, the average age of Sichuan's rural \nmigrant workers was 31.5 years, and about 80% were under 35. Among this group, about 10% had \nsenior high school education, 37.3% had junior high school education, and the rest had primary \neducation. Individuals with a basic educational level are becoming the mainstream of the rural labor \nforce.6 They are open to new ideas and are eager to improve their lives through migrant work. \n \n7.  Employment services and training for rural migrant workers. The PES system has well \nestablished arrangements in urban areas, but employment services are not necessarily available or \nappropriate for the needs of rural migrant workers. PES coverage is unbalanced, work systems are \nnot yet complete, service information channels are not efficient, service methods and procedures are \nrather inflexible, and service quality and results do not satisfactorily meet the needs of rural migrant \nworkers. The Sichuan provincial government has therefore accorded high priority to addressing the \nissue of surplus rural labor through strengthening the PES and increasing service efficiency to meet \nthe employment needs of rural migrant workers seeking work in urban areas. \n \n8.  The goals of strengthening the PES include (i) encouraging and helping rural migrant workers \nsecure urban employment more rapidly, (ii) reducing the cost of this transfer, and (iii) safeguarding \ntheir legal rights and interests. To achieve this, the Sichuan provincial government intends to expand \nthe  PES  to  ensure  that  job  seekers  from  rural  areas  (at  the  township  and  village  levels)  have \nadequate and relevant information about employment opportunities and market demand. For instance, \nan expanded PES would organize job fairs at the village level, thereby providing rural migrants with \naccess to information that would enable them to obtain employment and seek appropriate skills \ntraining. A training system for occupational skills and self employment needs to be established to \nencourage rural migrants to take part in the vocational skills appraisal program. The global economic \nrecession has resulted in a sharp drop in employers' demand for migrant workers in various export-\noriented factories in urban areas. Making the skills training system more responsive to labor market \nneeds, and strengthening links between skills training and the private sector would mitigate structural \nskill  mismatches  in  the  labor  market.  In  particular,  an  effective  skills  training  system  and  a \nstrengthened PES would produce better suited labor market entrants, and facilitate training/retraining \n                                                 \n6  Sichuan Administrative Bureau of Labor & Employment Service. 2007. Basic Situations of Rural Labor Force Transferred \nEmployment in Sichuan Province. PRC (province report under TA 4858-PRC). \n ", "  3\nof those switching or in between jobs. This would improve the overall effectiveness of the labor market \nand help lower unemployment. There is also a need to eliminate discriminatory regulations and \nunreasonable restrictions for rural migrants seeking work in urban areas so that they can enter the \nlabor market on equal terms with others. \n \n9.  Equitable service provision, gender, and disadvantaged groups. In addition to extending \npublic  employment  services  from  urban  to  rural  areas,  Sichuan's  provincial  government  pays \nconsiderable attention to related issues, including equitable service provision to women, long-term \nunemployed, job seekers from areas severely affected by the earthquake, the disabled, and university \ngraduates from low-income families. Women, while accounting for less than 50% of all migrant \nworkers nationwide, tend to concentrate in a narrow range of jobs and industries. For example, young \nwomen workers from other provinces dominate large manufacturing and processing plants in coastal \nurban areas. Issues specific to young women migrant workers in Sichuan must be systematically \nreviewed, and the PES must be tailored to their special needs. Further, monitoring of employment and \nservice provision data by gender needs to be strengthened.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the TA is strengthened capacity and effectiveness of the PES, particularly for \nrural\u2013urban migrants in Sichuan Province. The outcome of the TA will be a comprehensive analysis of \nchoices  for  improving  the  effectiveness  of  the  PES  for  all  job  seekers,  particularly  rural\u2013urban \nmigrants in Sichuan Province.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA outputs will be (i) key policy recommendations on measures and mechanisms for \nimproving the PES for all job seekers, and particularly for migrant workers in Sichuan, and (ii) widely \ndisseminated publications on key TA findings and recommendations. Specifically, TA outputs will \ninclude:  (i)  the  main  TA  report,  (ii)  a  supporting  technical  report  on  labor  market  analysis  and \ninformation systems and networks, as well as effective means of information dissemination to migrant \nworkers; (iii) a supporting technical report on institutional and staff capacity-building needs in key \nareas,  including  information  management,  coordination,  and  networking,  to  improve  vocational \nguidance for migrant workers, (iv) a policy note for decision makers, (v) a conference report, and (vi) \nan executive summary of the main TA report. The policy recommendations will be drawn from the \nanalysis and assessment in the main TA report of key issues, including (i) policy environment; (ii) \ncapacity constraints and efficiency issues; (iii) labor market analysis, particularly on the demand side; \n(iv)  labor  market  information  systems;  (v)  capacity  building  for  employment  service  staff;  (vi) \nstrengthening of public\u2013private partnerships; (vii) ways in which the existing PES is currently used, \nincluding a survey of the informal networking behaviors of target clients (job seekers); (viii) employers' \nknowledge of and satisfaction with the PES system, and how they can contribute to improving the \nsystem; and (ix) gender issues, taking into account the implications of the global economic recession \nfor job creation, employment, and social safety nets in Sichuan. These policy measures and effective \nmechanisms for implementation should be identified, prioritized, and costed. Policy recommendations \nand key TA findings will be disseminated among the stakeholders and general public through a variety \nof  media  including  the  government's  websites,  printed  materials,  and  presentations  during \nconferences. The policy note for decision makers, which presents key findings and major policy \nrecommendations of the TA, will be shared with decision makers at the national and local levels.  \n \n12.  The TA will be implemented in three phases over an 11-month period. Phase 1, lasting 4 \nmonths, will comprise (i) a review of the policies and strategies of the PES system at five levels \n(province,  prefecture,  county,  township,  and  village)  in  Sichuan,  with  a  particular  emphasis  on \n ", "4   \nChengdu and Guang Yuan; (ii) a study that identifies challenges and opportunities to improve the PES, \nespecially for the rural population, including a labor supply and demand analysis, economic growth \nprojections, policy analysis, and capacity of PES staff; (iii) a survey of migrant workers' needs for PES; \n(iv) an overseas study tour to review effective PES models; and (v) an inception report with draft \noutlines of the two technical reports. The main report will build on the findings of the ADB-funded TA \nfor Employment Services for Migrant Workers (footnote 3), in which Sichuan was one of the case \nstudies; the ADB-funded TA for Improvement of Public Employment Service System in the Western \nRegion;7 and other relevant initiatives concerning the PES in the PRC. A study visit will be held early \nin TA implementation. Participants, who will be officials from provincial and local governments that \nmake and implement policies relating to the PES for migrant workers, will be able to (i) observe good \npractices in a country with rich experience in migrant worker issues, and (ii) exchange experiences \nand lessons learned with officials from other countries. \n \n13.  In phase 2, lasting 5 months, the TA will (i) undertake further analysis of the PES in Sichuan; \n(ii) review best practices, including policies and strategies of the PES system in selected provinces \nand  municipalities  (e.g.,  Anhui,  Beijing,  Chongqing,  Guangdong,  and  Shanghai);  (iii)  prepare \nrecommendations for improving labor market analysis and information systems; and (iv) prepare and \nconduct training for relevant officials. The TA will review the feasibility of adapting a \"toolkit\" of \nmaterials developed by ADB\u2019s TA for Employment Services for Migrant Workers aimed at providing \nassistance to rural migrant workers. Best practices in PES and recommendations will be reflected in \nthe midterm review report, which will be prepared at the end of phase 2. Phase 3, lasting 2 months, \nwill (i) organize a series of stakeholder consultations in  Sichuan to share preliminary findings and \ndevelop two technical reports and a policy note with recommendations; (ii) finalize the main report that \nmakes recommendations for an effective, demand-based, user-friendly, and operational PES system, \nwhich will serve the people of Sichuan, including the disadvantaged population, such as ethnic \nminorities,  women,  the  unemployed,  and  those  living  in  rural  and  remote  areas;  (iii)  develop  a \nstrategic plan for developing an effective PES for 2009\u20132020; (iv) finalize the two technical reports \nand policy note to be widely disseminated; and (v) organize a final review workshop and a final \nconference to present key TA findings. \n \n14.  Three workshops and one conference will be held. The workshops will serve as a platform for \n(i) sharing TA findings at various stages, (ii) building consensus among TA stakeholders, and (iii) \ngetting feedback for improving the TA work and findings. The workshops will be issue-oriented and \nare tentatively scheduled at the start of the TA, halfway through the TA, and before the conference. \nThe conference will be held towards the end of the TA to (i) disseminate the main findings of the TA, \n(ii) exchange experiences and information about public employment services for migrant workers \nwithin the country and those going abroad, and (iii) provide inputs for improving and finalizing the \nmain report.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $480,000 equivalent, of which $400,000 equivalent \nwill be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2014others). The \ngovernment will provide $80,000 equivalent to cover TA office equipment costs, communications, and \nremuneration and per diem for counterpart staff. Tentative cost estimates and the financing plan are in \nAppendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The TA will be implemented over an 11-month period from April 2010 to March 2011. The \nSichuan Employment Service and Administration Bureau (SESAB) will be the executing agency and \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2008.

Manila (TA 7163\u2013PRC, for $400,000, approved on 4 November). \n ", "  5\nimplementing agency for the TA. SESAB will be responsible for coordination and providing information \nand other conditions necessary for the consultants to complete their tasks successfully. The deputy \ndirector of SESAB will be the provincial government\u2019s focal point for communication and coordination \nof  TA  implementation.  This  will  be  the  first  time  for  SESAB  to  be  the  executing  agency  and \nimplementing agency for ADB-financed TA. A detailed institutional assessment will be conducted \nduring  TA  implementation.  SESAB  will  provide  a  suitably  furnished  office,  utilities,  and \ntelecommunication access (broadband internet connection), transport in Chengdu for consultants, \nrelevant materials, maps, data, and documents as required under the TA, and will cover the cost of \noffice utilities for the consultants. SESAB will organize an expert review group of invited national \nexperts, who will review inception, interim, and final reports prepared by the consultants. The TA \nconsultants will incorporate the suggestions of the expert review group into the final reports. The \nSichuan Provincial Finance Bureau will provide oversight, and will facilitate and support SESAB's \nwork during TA implementation.  \n \n17.  TA  equipment  will  be  procured  by  the  consultants  after  consultations  with  SESAB  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time), and will be \nretained by SESAB upon TA completion. The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in line with ADB's \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.8 TA disbursement will be handled by ADB. The TA \nproject  will  finance  expenditures  incurred  for  consulting  services,  equipment,  surveys,  and \nmiscellaneous administration and support costs. Payments to consultants will be made directly upon \nsubmission of claim forms. An advance payment facility will be established under the TA to facilitate \nproject implementation. SESAB will provide relevant forms for liquidation of advances. A total of 25 \nperson-months  of  consulting  services  (one  international  for  5  person-months  and  four  national \nconsultants for a total of 20 person-months) will be required. The TA consultants will be engaged \nthrough a firm in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time) and based on the quality of the proposal (90%) and the cost (10%) of the services \nto be provided (under the quality- and cost-based selection method), using a simplified technical \nproposal. The 90:10 weighting is considered appropriate because it is expected that the TA will have \na  strong  impact  on  the  development  of  future  PES  policies  in  Sichuan  Province,  and  therefore \nrequires high-quality technical inputs. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n18.  All  reports  by  the  consultants  will  be  prepared  in  English  and  translated  into  Chinese. \nTranslation costs for project reports will be budgeted and allocated to the consultants. The consultants \nwill maintain close working relations with ADB and SESAB, and will regularly discuss project progress \nand findings. Meetings involving the ADB task manager, consultants, and SESAB officials will be held \nto provide guidance to the consultants and to review their reports. Consultants will prepare training \nseminars, in coordination with SESAB officials and ADB, to be delivered to directors and/or vice-\ndirectors in the labor employment system in Sichuan, officials of selected cities (prefectures), counties \n(cities, districts), officials of related departments such as the Development and Reform, Finance, and \nHuman Resource departments, as well as selected members of research and academic organizations. \nDissemination of results will be crucial for the success of the project. A policy note will become a \nknowledge product of this TA. The final workshop will present the TA\u2019s key recommendations to \nofficials from Sichuan Province and ministries at the central level. The outputs of the TA will be \ndisseminated through the media. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the provision \nof technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to the Government \nof  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Strengthening  Equitable  Provision  of  Public  Employment \nServices in Sichuan Province, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2008.
