The  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  prepared  and  administered  a  grant \nfunded  by  the  Trust  Fund  for  East  Timor  (TFET)  for  the \nEmergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (EIRP) to restore \nroad  conditions,  port  operations,  and  power  supply  to  enable \nhumanitarian aid delivery and resumption of economic activities. \nThe needs of the infrastructure sectors, particularly for road sector \nrestoration, require additional funding over and above the initial \ngrant.  Supplementary  resources  for  the  EIRP  are  to  support \nrestoration of the road conditions to a standard where the road \nnetwork can make a contribution to economic activities and be \nmaintained by an East Timorese field maintenance administration. \n   \nBeneficiary  East Timor \n   \nProject Description  The  Emergency  Infrastructure  Rehabilitation  Project  (Phase  2) \n(EIRP-2) will intensify and extend the objectives of the EIRP and \nfocus on stabilizing the road network leaving it in a condition that \ncan be maintained with a relatively modest budget. The EIRP-2 \nwill  also  continue  programs  to  establish  a  viable  and  efficient \nmaintenance operation in East Timor. \n \nThe EIRP-2 will provide (i) sustainable road works that reduce the \nannual  emergency  rehabilitation  requirement,  (ii)  support  for \nestablishing a road maintenance regime, (iii) detailed engineering \nservices, and (iv) project management services and training. \n \nThe EIRP-2 is classified as environmental category B. An initial \nenvironmental examination was undertaken, and its summary is \nincluded as a core appendix. \n \nThe immediate benefits of the EIRP-2 include (i) improvement of \naccess to rural areas, (ii) inducement of agricultural cultivation, (iii) \nreduction  of  urbanization  trends,  and  (iv)  facilitation  of \nhumanitarian aid programs and security conditions. The EIRP-2 \nwill employ local communities, focusing on the poorest in rural \nareas where most people have very limited income-generating \nopportunities. Local communities will also be employed under a \nsustainable  and  long-term  road  maintenance  program,  and \nopportunities  and  training  programs  will  be  provided  for  the \nemerging road industry. \n   ", " \niii\nExecuting Agency  The Ministry of Water and Public Works will be the Executing \nAgency.  The  project  implementing  agency  will  be  the  project \nmanagement unit (PMU), which will execute and implement EIRP-\n2  activities.  The  PMU  will  be  managed  by  an  East  Timorese \nproject manager and comprise international and East Timorese \nexperts. \n   \nCost Estimates and   The total cost of the EIRP-2 is estimated at $9.0 million. The \n  Financing Plan  EIRP-2 will be financed by a grant of $9.0 million from the TFET, \nfrom funds contributed by donors but that do not include ADB \nresources.  The  International  Development  Association  of  the \nWorld Bank Group is the Trustee of the TFET. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2004. \n   \nEstimated Project  30 December 2003. \n  Completion Date \n   \nProcurement  Civil works will be awarded on the basis of international shopping \nand  international  local  competitive  bidding  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. International contractors are \nencouraged to utilize labor-intensive methodologies maximizing \nlocal employment. Eligibility for procurement and engagement of \nconsultants will include ADB member countries, East Timor, and \nall donors and members of international organizations that have \ncontributed to the TFET. \n \nInternational consulting services will be required for the PMU and \nfor  detailed  engineering.  The  consultants  will  be  selected  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of \ndomestic  consultants.  Advance  procurement  action  for  the \nselection of detailed engineering consultants has been approved. \n \n ", " \n \n ", " \n \nI.  THE PROJECT \n1.  I submit for your information the following report on a supplementary grant to East Timor \nfor  the  Emergency  Infrastructure  Rehabilitation  Project  (Phase  2)  (EIRP-2).1  The  project \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  INTRODUCTION \n2.  In January 2000, the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) \nasked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to prepare and administer emergency assistance to \nrehabilitate damaged infrastructure for early restoration of normal socioeconomic activities. An \nADB  appraisal  mission2  visited  East  Timor  in  February  2000  and  prepared  the  EIRP.3 \nNegotiations for the Grant Agreement for the Project were completed with UNTAET on 29 March \n2000, and became effective on 19 April 2000. Funding for the grant is drawn from the Trust Fund \nfor  East  Timor  (TFET),  which  is  established  under  the  trusteeship  of  the  International \nDevelopment  Agency  of  the  World  Bank  Group.  The  TFET  does  not  include  ADB\u2019s  own \nresources. Implementation of the EIRP commenced in late April and disbursements in May 2000.  \n \n3.  The  project  management  unit  (PMU)  began  operations  in  April  2000  with  both \ninternational and East Timorese staff. In May 2000, the PMU issued the first work orders to \nrepair the worst road closures. In June, five major contracts were implemented on the main road \nsections to facilitate road access during the rainy season in the third quarter of 2000. Since then \na  total  of  66  road  rehabilitation  contracts,  involving  a  significant  share  of  East  Timorese \ncontractors and consultants, have been awarded under the EIRP. The impact of these works \nhas been significant in facilitating humanitarian aid to rural areas and enhancing the revival of \neconomic activities since the September 1999 crisis. \n \n4.  In  August  2000,  the  EIRP  completed  upgrading  a  container  terminal  yard  and  an \nincomplete third berth, and repaired a landing slip at Dili Port. These actions have reduced \ncongestion of port premises and contributed to reducing vessel queuing time, thus enhancing \ndelivery of goods and aid. Also in August 2000, the 21 rural power stations assigned to the \nEIRP were assessed. Work on the power station was delayed due to the gradual award of \ndisbursement authority resulting from delayed cash receipts in the TFET and poor security \nconditions along the western border of East Timor. The rehabilitation works are now estimated \nto require $2.4 million, and a difficult prioritization process has been carried out to adjust the \nwork program to the available funding.  \n \n5.  The infrastructure sectors, and most pressingly roads, suffer from immediate needs that \nrequire funding beyond the EIRP and the limited bilateral resources. Additional funding of $9.0 \nmillion has become available from the TFET for the infrastructure sectors. UNTAET asked ADB \nto prepare the project documentation for and administer implementation of the new allocation. \nSubsequently, appraisal was carried out from 14 to 28 February 2001.4 Objectives, scope, and \nimplementation  were  agreed  in  a  memorandum  of  understanding.  In  light  of  the  limited \navailability of additional funding, the sector needs have been considered under a rigorous \n                                                 \n1  The Project first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in January 2002. \n2  The mission comprised S.

The new supplementary allocation EIRP-2 will continue and intensify the \nefforts made under the EIRP and support the EIRP's objectives. In particular, the EIRP-2 will \nfocus on restoring the road network to a condition, where routine maintenance will effectively \nextend its economic life. This report is prepared in accordance with the Joint Management \nArrangements for the Trust Fund for East Timor.5 \n \nIII.  BACKGROUND \nA.  Response to Crisis \n6.  Description of Damage. In the democratic consultation of 30 August 1999, the people \nof East Timor voted overwhelmingly for independence. This was followed by a campaign of \ndestruction, during which three quarters of the population fled their homes and most of the \ncountry\u2019s infrastructure, commerce, and private homes were destroyed. Most of the refugees \nhave now returned from West Timor and the forest, and have settled with the support of \nhumanitarian relief. Consequent to the postreferendum destruction, all administrative structures \nbecame dysfunctional, including public offices tasked to manage the infrastructure sectors.  \n \n7.  Administration.  A  resolution  of  the  United  Nations  Security  Council  established \nUNTAET to ensure stability and establish a transitional government prior to formation of an East \nTimorese administration. General elections were conducted on 30 August 2001, and an East \nTimorese  Second  Transitional  Administration  through  its  cabinet  of  members  assumed \nresponsibility for economic development as delegated under UNTAET Regulation No. 2001/28. \nUNTAET administered East Timor until 19 May 2002. On 20 May 2002, East Timor gained its \nindependence and is now governed as a republic with a democratically elected president and \nparliament, and a prime minister-led government. Under its Resolution No. 1412 of 17 May \n2002, the Security Council established a United Nations Mission in East Timor to support the \ncore administrative structures critical to the viability and political stability of East Timor. In \nSeptember  2001,  the  former  Department  of  Infrastructure  that  had  managed \ntelecommunications, postal services, electricity, water and sanitation, and transport, including \nroads, ports, and aviation, was replaced by the Ministry of Water and Public Works (MWPW) \nresponsible for roads, water, buildings and the Government's civil works and the Ministry of \nCommunications and Transport responsible for ports, airports and land transport. \n \n8.  Recurrent Budget. The Government's recurrent budget is drawn from donor funding. \nExpenditures are primarily salaries for East Timorese employees and recurrent consumables \nsuch as fuel. The capital development budget, drawn from the TFET, was assessed by a World \nBank-coordinated multiagency joint assessment mission (JAM) in October-November 1999. \nComprehensive  sector  budgets,  prepared  with  ADB  support,  reflect  significant  shortfalls \nbetween the needs and trust fund contributions in the recurrent and capital budgets.  \n \n9.  Poverty. East Timor\u2019s poverty profile is dramatically affected by the massive political, \neconomic, and social upheaval in September 1999.6 As a result of the postreferendum violence, \ncash incomes became nonexistent for most of the population. In 1996, when East Timor was \npart of Indonesia, its gross domestic product (GDP) per capita income was $431, or 37% of the \n                                                 \n5  R74-00: Joint Management Arrangements for the Trust Fund for East Timor, 23 March 2000. \n6\n ADB. 2000. Regional Technical Assistance for Poverty Assessment in Pacific Developing Member Countries. \nManila. The official Indonesian poverty line is calculated using the social survey undertaken by the Indonesian \nBureau of Statistics. This is defined as the cost of ensuring a minimum daily food consumption of 2,100 kilocalories \nper person. \n ", "3 \nIndonesian national average. As a result of the Asian crisis, poverty increased, and the decline \nin East Timor's GDP was more pronounced than that of Indonesia due to its dependence on \nIndonesian central government grants. The number of households living below the Indonesian \nofficial poverty line rose to an estimated 50 to 60% from 30% in 1996. From 1998, the average \nincome of the poor (those living below the poverty line) steadily increased to about 7% of \npopulation in 1999 from 2% less than the poverty line. The poor are characterized by a lack of \neducation, low literacy, high dependency burdens, and dependence on subsistence agriculture. \nFarming is the primary occupation of 85% of household heads. \n \n10.  Restoration  Programs.  In  response  to  the  crisis,  the  United  Nations  Office  for \nCoordination  of  Humanitarian  Affairs  coordinated  immediate  humanitarian  relief  programs \nduring  the  first  three  months  from  December  1999.  To  plan  for  the  urgent  medium-term \nrehabilitation in a coordinated manner, ADB joined the JAM in October-November 1999. As a \nresult, ADB and the World Bank agreed to work together on the reconstruction of East Timor, \nwith ADB as the lead agency for restoring the infrastructure sectors. Subsequently, ADB's Board \napproved  a  delegated  approval  authority  for  project  proposals  by  ADB's  Management, \nexpanded  eligibility  under  ADB's  procurement  guidelines,  disbursement  procedures  in \naccordance with ADB's disbursement guidelines, and establishment of grant agreements for \nprojects funded from the TFET (footnote 5).7 \n \n11.  The ADB-funded technical assistance (TA) for transport sector restoration8 implemented \nADB\u2019s  first  intervention  in  the  three  transport  subsectors  by  taking  steps  to  establish  the \ninstitutions  and  regulatory  frameworks  in  the  road,  port,  and  airport  subsectors,  and  by \nreviewing the long-term development requirements. Further TA will be implemented to prepare \nlegal frameworks for the new institutions and implement effective agency operations. The TAs \nand the EIRP work in tandem to support the process for establishing appropriately scaled sector \noperations in East Timor.  \n \nB.  Transport Subsector Description \n12.  East Timor forms the eastern half of Timor Island, and includes the islands of Atauro and \nJoco and the Oecusse enclave, on the north coast of the island within Indonesian territory. It \nstretches for 250 kilometers (km) east to west and 80 km north to south at the widest point with \nan area of 14,900 square kilometers (km2).9 The terrain is dominated by a spinal range of \nmountains reaching nearly 3,000 meters (m) at the highest point. Narrow plains characterize the \nnorth and south coasts. The hinterland consists mainly of mountains and intervening narrow \nvalleys, which become broader and flatter in the east with extensive limestone plateaus.  \n \n13.  The transport system in East Timor is multimodal, comprising about 5,000 km of roads; \none container port, three smaller wharves, small jetties, and landings; and two international \nairports and eight grass airstrips. The past demand on the transport system in East Timor was \nthat of a provincial economy. All internal traffic in East Timor depended on land transport, \nawarding the road sector a paramount role. Benefits from intermodal linkages are minimal as \ndomestic maritime transport is not available, and the potential for inland and southern coastal \n                                                 \n7 The delegated authority provides an arrangement for the TFET and an expansion of eligibility under ADB's \nprocurement and engagement of consultant guidelines to include member countries, East Timor, and all donor and \nmember of international organizations that have provided contribution funds to the TFET. \n8  ADB. 2000.

", "4 \nmaritime transport suffers from weather and seasonal impact. Aviation is thwarted on account of \naffordability.  \n \n1.  Roads \na.  Description \n14.  The road network is supported by the main coastal east-west arteries along the northern \nand southern coastlines. The north-south secondary roads connect these two links. The network \nconsists of some 1,200 km of main roads, 2,000 km of district roads, and about 1,800 km of \nfeeder roads. The road network is relatively dense considering the low level of economic \ndevelopment and sparse population with approximately 1 km of road for 3 km2; about 50% of \nroads were sealed at one time. \n \n15.  However, this network is challenged by young geology and weather conditions. Forty \npercent of the land is on steep slopes. The tectonic conditions of the island endow it with \nsedimentary sandstone and calcareous rocks with some basic igneous material; these rocks \ncomprise conglomerates; reef limestone; and alluvial cobble, sand, and silt deposits. From an \nengineering viewpoint, these conditions and the lightweight nature of the pavement require \nannual maintenance action. As a result, roads remain fragile and susceptible to a monsoon \nclimate  that  even  under  the  best  conditions  would  require  a  moderate  to  high  level  of \nmaintenance.  From  an  engineering  viewpoint,  the  geology  even  without  earthworks  or \nagriculture makes roads highly susceptible to severe annual landslides. Many routes are also \ncrossed by a number of large braided rivers10 with a combination of bridges and causeways. \nThese causeways are vulnerable to the natural realignment of the waterways. During the rainy \nseason, rivers flood the roads and interrupt the transport system.  \n \n16.  While most of the main road network was sealed, the road surfaces on the minor \nnetwork have now deteriorated to gravel. The sealed network was built to a minimum standard \nto provide all-weather access to small and light vehicle traffic. The lightweight nature of the \npavement has not been viable, and could only be so if kept well drained and vehicle axle loads \nrestricted.  Although  the  Indonesian  Government  spent  most  public  funds  on  infrastructure, \ninfrastructure systems in East Timor remained underdeveloped. Road repairs and maintenance \nwere inadequately funded. Eighty percent of the 1997/98 infrastructure budget of $5.8 million, \nfunded both centrally and locally, implemented roadworks in East Timor. In the following year, \nthis was reduced by 22%, with the road improvement budget falling by 25%, road rehabilitation \nby 65%, and maintenance by 14%.  \n \n17.  All roads have suffered from the long-term neglect of maintenance. The maintenance \nchallenge was compounded by the low design standard adopted and the changing course of the \nmany north-south braided rivers. The roads, built for low volumes and light traffic, and then used \nby  the  heavy  vehicles  of  the  transitional  administration,  have  deteriorated  further.  As  a \nconsequence, the network has incurred a large backlog of road repair needs in addition to \nordinary routine maintenance. While the EIRP is addressing the backlog requirement, if the \nnetwork is to be left in a reasonable and maintainable condition at project completion, additional \n                                                 \n10 Braided river denotes a river with a wide river valley and an unidentified primary river channel subject to changing \nlocation due to because of frequent changes in river flow and sediment supply. As the channels of a braided river \nchange course frequently, they risk to eventually cover an entire valley floor, which then would experience flooding \non  a  regular  basis. A  braided  river  typically  has  no  conventional  floodplain.  In  contrast  to  braided  rivers, \nmeandering rivers typically only contain one channel that winds its way across the floodplain. As it flows, it deposits \nsediment on banks that lie on the insides of curves and erode the banks on the outside of curves. ", "5 \nresources will be required to clear the maintenance backlog. Road drainage clearance and \nrestoration is also being carried under the EIRP, and needs to be continued on a regular basis \nby a sustainable maintenance operation.  \n \nb.  Medium- to Long-Term Sector Development  \n18.  Economic Context. The road network is an extremely valuable asset for East Timor. \nGiven the foreseeable economic circumstances of the country, an extensively paved national \nroad network is an irreplaceable national endowment that could be irreparably damaged if \nregular maintenance is not instituted as a matter of urgency. GDP growth in East Timor is \nprojected11 until 2003 at 15% per annum as a result of reconstruction. From 2004 to 2010, the \nannual GDP growth rate is forecast at 10% due to the impact of full production from the Timor \nGap oil fields. Growth is projected to stabilize at 7% from 2011 to 2015 and at 5% from 2015 to \n2030.  The  growth  drivers\u2014agricultural  production,  crops,  and  livestock\u2014need  transport \nservices. Traffic for forestry, fishing, tourism, other service activities, and microenterprises will \ngrow in direct proportion to the growth drivers. Only with adequate accessibility will production \nactivities  diversify  and  intensify  and  the  benefits  of  increased  productivity,  employment, \npopulation, and per capita income will follow. \n \n19.  Transport  Sector  Plan.  The  role  of  a  sound  transport  sector  plan  is  central  for \nidentification of the transport sector linkages with the productive sectors and macroeconomic \ndevelopment,  sector  management,  operation  and  maintenance,  intermodal  planning,  and \ncohesive investment programs and work plans. A draft multimodal transport sector plan was \nprepared under the Transport Sector Restoration TA (footnote 8) for the consideration of the \nnew government as a national transport plan.  \n \n20.  Sector Administration. The transport subsectors are currently managed by MWPW by \na minister and a vice-minister. These are supported by a director general and a small staff. The \nlow levels of East Timorese staff have constrained the capacity building process. In July 2000, \nthe National Cabinet of East Timor approved the drafting of a transport act to provide for the \nestablishment of ports, airports, and road under one legislative instrument. The advantages of \none legal instrument are clarity and ability to extract all economies of scale in organizing sector \nadministration. Legal and structural establishment of transport sector administration is pending. \nUNTAET requested ADB-funded TA to (i) draft legislation and (ii) support implementation of \nefficient organizations that would be directly accountability to the government and users for \npolicy and strategy implementation for service provision, and management efficiency. TA for \nTransport Sector Improvement was approved on 1 October 200112 for this purpose. \n \n21.  Requirements. The road budget in Appendix 2 provides a view of the requirements for a \nbasic road service. This service level facilitates access to most villages, delivery of minimal \nsocial services, and transport needs of agricultural produce to the main markets. The budget \nalso records currently available funding for roads. With the EIRP-2 and the EIRP successfully \nreducing the backlog maintenance requirement to a minimum, maintaining 1,200 km of the total \nof 5,000 km of roads in their current condition is estimated to cost about $9.3 million per annum. \nThis figure comprises road agency costs of $3.4 million, and routine and emergency monsoon \nmaintenance costs of $4.4 million and $1.5 million.  \n \n                                                 \n11 International Monetary Fund forecasts. \n12 ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to East Timor for Transport Sector Improvement. Manila. ", "6 \n22.  Funding. Facing a constrained road budget, the road agency may consider funding \nperiodic road and bridge maintenance through carefully targeted investment projects until the \nroad subsector can recover financing from its client users. These estimates assume that the \ncurrent grant-funded programs will hand the network over to the new road administration free of \nan  accumulated  backlog  maintenance  requirement.  The  addition  of  periodic  maintenance \nactivity\u2014pavement  repair,  regraveling,  resurfacing  sealed  pavements\u2014would  increase  the \nannual road maintenance budget to an unaffordable $20 million. The road budget represents \nabout 4% of the total recurrent budget of $63.5 million of the Government. This remains below \nthe average road sector expenditure in most countries. The UNTAET allocated $2.3 million with \na total of $13.7 million coming from the TFET and the Government of Japan in the 2001/02 \nfiscal year; $7.0 million in 2002/03, $15 million in 2003/04, and $18 million in 2004/05. These \nfigures correspond with calculated maintenance needs. Excluding the promise provided by the \noff-shore gas economy, the total recurrent budget is sustainable, in particular with the planned \nbudgetary support from the World Bank. \n \n23.  Road Assets. The EIRP is preparing a detailed road asset inventory and condition \ndatabase, crucial for establishing an optimal road maintenance regime. Based on this data, a \nreclassification of the roads to their functional categories based on traffic and use will support \nrationalizing road maintenance resources with the priority requirements.  \n \n24.  Road Maintenance. An adequate recurrent budget will prevent deterioration of social \nconditions, isolation of villages, and significant reduction in access to social services including \naccess  to  schools,  health  clinics,  electricity,  and  water.  Establishing  a  cost-effective  road \nmaintenance regime requires foresight to finance recurrent routine and preventive maintenance, \nand thus budget discipline, determination, and a change to a systematic maintenance mentality. \nThese  must  be  effectively  maintained  by  establishing  an  appropriately  scaled  routine \nmaintenance program and administration. To ensure such affordability, reduction of the backlog \nmaintenance  requirement  is  the  objective  of  the  ongoing  emergency  road  repair  and \nrehabilitation  programs.  While  the  EIRP  addresses  the  accumulated  backlog,  additional \nresources are required for to bring the road network to a maintainable condition, in which it can \nbe managed by the new maintenance regime. With the supplementary funding, the restoration \nprogram is expected to reduce the backlog requirement and thus enable road maintenance with \na minimal budget. Concurrently, the EIRP is establishing technical capacity within the field \norganization  to  deliver  routine,  emergency,  and  periodic  maintenance  services.  Additional \nresources are required to endow the field organization with the technical skills, management \nprocess, and contractual regime with which it will be able to maintain the repaired network.  \n \nC.  External Assistance and Donor Coordination \n25.  The EIRP is fully coordinated with donor support to the overall emergency restoration of \nEast Timor, and in particular, with the emergency programs in the three project sectors. The \nEIRP  has  cofinanced  and  collaborated  in  civil  works  programs  of  the  United  Nations \nPeacekeeping  Force  (UNPKF).  Particularly  in  river  training,  UNPKF  equipment  has  been \ndeployed in combination with community labor engaged by the EIRP to enhance water flow in \nthe original river channel and to facilitate labor-based road repairs.  \n ", "7 \nIV.  THE EMERGENCY INFRASTRUCTURE REHABILITATION PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n26.  The EIRP has aimed to support humanitarian assistance in East Timor by rehabilitating \ntransport and power infrastructure to facilitate peace and security, and to provide the East \nTimorese with access to the humanitarian relief aid. \n \nB.  Objectives and Scope \n27.  The EIRP objective is to (i) undertake emergency road repair works to facilitate efficient \ntransport of humanitarian aid and security cargo, and to induce revival of economic activity; (ii) \nexpand the capacity of port facilities to reduce congestion; and (iii) reinstate power supply. In \naddition  to  its  emergency  nature,  the  EIRP  supports  long-term  sector  development  by \nstrengthening the local contracting industry, instituting operational and maintenance systems, \nand providing capacity building for sector management. \n  \n28.  The EIRP consists of the following components: \n \n(i)  road rehabilitation, including road repair, equipment for road repair works, labor-\nbased road and causeway restoration, and rehabilitation and reinstatement of \nbridges and depot facilities; \n \n(ii)  port rehabilitation, including wharf extension at Dili Port, restoration of the landing \ncraft slipway at Dili Port, restoration of the container yard at Dili Port, and port \nrepairs; \n \n(iii)  power sector rehabilitation, including rehabilitation of 15 power stations, and \nsupport to develop a power utility and its financial management system; and  \n \n(iv)  project management services and training. \n \nC.  Implementation Performance \n1.  Road Rehabilitation \n29.  Road Rehabilitation. As of December 2001, the EIRP had tendered 66 road repair civil \nworks contracts, of which 42 are complete and 24 in progress. Past contracts have addressed \nspecific road closures by repairing slips, culvert failures, and drainage. The current and future \ncontracts under the EIRP address backlog maintenance to the extent possible, in addition to \nensuring access on the main road network. These contracts have generated 192,263 labor \ndays, and restored 1,025 km of road drainage involving 259 villages. The 248 contractors were \nprequalified  under  a  capacity  classification  system  providing  a  foundation  for  a  contractor \nregistry. Of the total 104 prequalified contractors, 95 are East Timorese.  \n \n30.  Bridge Restoration. The EIRP conducted an emergency and a medium-term bridge \ncondition survey covering all major bridge structures and the culverts. This resulted in a phased \nemergency  bridge  works  program  and  a  medium-term  bridge  rehabilitation  program \nincorporated into the transport sector master plan. Under its first phase, the emergency program \nincludes works identified on nine critical bridges, river training, and provision of a stock of ", "8 \ntemporary bridge materials for use in the event of weather-related bridge failures. The EIRP is \nimplementing these requirements under its road repair component. \n \n31.  Road Maintenance. The EIRP has also established four regional depots: Baucau, Dili \nwith Oecusse as its sub-depot, Maliana, and Same, each with an East Timorese regional \nengineer  and  an  international  engineer-trainer.  The  recurrent  costs  of  the  depots  are \nincorporated in the UNTAET-prepared recurrent budget. The depots will establish a core routine \nroad maintenance organization. A road inventory and condition database is under preparation \nfor budgeting and prioritizing maintenance needs, and a standardized contracting regime for \nengaging communities for labor-intensive vegetation and drainage clearing activities. The EIRP \nis providing training for the emerging contractors on the use of appropriate technologies for \nemergency and periodic maintenance of rural roads, bid preparation, estimation, cost control, \ncontract procedures, and management. Each depot is supplied with a minimal pool of essential \nroad maintenance equipment.  \n \n32.  Road  Administration.  The  EIRP  is  establishing  a  basic  accounting  and  recording \nsystems to support field management, budgeting, and contracting, as well as for record keeping \nand  enhancement  of  sector  governance  and  accountability.  The  EIRP  also  supports \nestablishment of an effective transport administration. ADB-funded TA will support legal and \noperational establishment of a road administration.  \n \n33.  Donor Coordination. Road restoration activities are coordinated on a geographic basis \nby the EIRP, the Government of Japan funded Dili-Ainaro road rehabilitation; and UNTAET-\nassessed, budget-funded contracts. The road rehabilitation activities include (i) road works \nunder the EIRP, (ii) the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)-Japan project for the \nDili-Aileu-Ainaro-Cassa  road  for  $4.7  million,  (iii)  UNTAET-funded  road  repair  and  bridge \nrestoration projects, and (iv) the UNPKF road works. All ongoing road works, shown in Appendix \n3, are coordinated under ADB-supported donor coordination meetings.  \n \n2.  Port Rehabilitation \n34.  Civil Works. The EIRP has completed (i) the third berth and slipway repair, (ii) concrete \ndecking of the third berth, and (ii) rehabilitation of the hardstand area at the eastern container \nyard of Dili Port.  \n \n35.  UNPKF has used the upgraded container yard to handle security cargo. To facilitate \nimprovement in port efficiency, UNPKF has reduced its presence at the eastern container area \nof Dili Port to minimal core operations, and plans to move all of its operations from the area. The \nEIRP will install a sealed surface in the area to reduce the environmental implications of heavy \nmachinery operating on a compacted surface.  \n \n36.  Cargo-Handling  Equipment.  Provision  of  port  cargo-handling  equipment  was \ndetermined redundant in light of the availability of private sector equipment. Funding for this \ncomponent was reallocated to a technical training program across transport and power sectors. \nThis will facilitate the transition of transport services to East Timorese management. A human \nresources development study is under way and will provide a framework for implementing of the \ntraining program.  \n \n37.  Donor  Coordination.  The  port  rehabilitation  activities  include  (i)  the  EIRP's \nrehabilitation works, (ii) UNTAET\u2019s small works for restoration of lighting and communications at \nDili Port, and (iii) UNDP-Japan funded contracts for the restoration of the wharf fenders and ", "9 \nnavigation aids at Dili Port. The ADB-funded TA, approved on 1 October 2001, will support legal \nestablishment of a port authority and its regulations, and improvement of port operations. \n \n3.  Power Rehabilitation \n38.  Rehabilitation  of  Power  Stations.  The  EIRP  has  assessed  21  subdistrict  power \nstations. The cost of the rehabilitation is estimated at $2.4 million. The PMU has carried out \ndetailed  assessment  of  the  communities'  needs  and  concluded  that  communities  consider \npower to be essential for ensuring a safe and healthy standard of living, facilitating economic \nactivities, and providing security; and that they are willing to pay for electricity supply. The \ncurrent  rehabilitation  program  will  rehabilitate  prioritized  rural  power  stations.  The  sector \nrequires significant additional resources to rehabilitate subdistrict and district stations, the latter \nhaving been commissioned after the postreferendum conflict with only quick-impact bilateral \nassistance.  \n \n39.  Utility Development and Financial Management System. Work has commenced to \nestablish a power utility, efficient utility management, and its financial management regime. \nRigorous tariff collection is being implemented with the support of the EIRP. It has additionally \nprocured and installed 1,000 single-phase and 300 three-phase meters, and is undertaking to \nprepare a human resource development program for the power sector. \n \n40.  Technical Assistance. The EIRP has supported the power service with tariff evaluation, \naccelerated tariff collection, budget preparation, provision of status reports, and assessment of \nsector issues. Through technical assistance and policy dialogue, ADB is also requested to \nassist the Government with preparation of strategy options and longterm development directions \nin the sector. Under this support, a review of the technical and management needs of 10 district \npower stations and needs of the principal Dili Stations not covered under the rehabilitation or \nany other donor program will be reviewed.13  \n \n41.  Donor Coordination. Donor-supported rehabilitation programs are coordinated on a \ngeographic basis (Appendix 4) in the context of ADB-supported donor coordination meetings. \nThe ongoing and planned power rehabilitation activities include (i) the rehabilitation works under \nthe EIRP, (ii) rehabilitation of 13 power stations and overhaul of the Comorro power station with \nfunding from the Government of Japan, and (iii) Government of Portugal-funded rehabilitation of \nfour power stations and support to increase the billing capacity of the power service. Similarly to \nthe program under the EIRP, the UNDP-administered rehabilitation programs funded by the \nGovernment of Japan will only be able to finance a portion of the planned program due to \nincreased requirements and cost estimates. ADB-funded TA to prepare a long-term power \nsector development plan is included in ADB\u2019s 2001 East Timor country program. This TA will \nexamine the potential for alternative renewable energy sources in East Timor.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n42.  Based on the available funding for emergency infrastructure restoration, in December \n2001 the EIRP was allocated $29.8 million, of which 67% has been disbursed and a total of \n$23.1 million committed in contracts. However, in November 1999, the JAM estimated the \nrestoration needs of power, ports, roads, and aviation to amount to $46.3 million. These needs \nwere prioritized and 70% of the EIRP funding was directed to restoration of roads with 9% for \n                                                 \n13 Aileu, Baucau, Dili-Caicoli, Los Palos, Maliana, Oecusse, Same, Suai, Viqueque. ", "10 \npower restoration, 7% for port restoration, and 10% for project management and advisory \nservices.  \n \n43.  Financing for the EIRP was provided on a grant basis from the TFET. Disbursements, \nand subsequently procurement, needed to be sensitive to the TFET's cash receipts, and funding \nhas been made available in installments of $7.0 million in June 2000 and $20.8 million in June \n2000. The final installment of $2.0 million was provided in the third quarter of 2001. The grant \nfinanced all the EIRP costs.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n44.  The recipient of the EIRP was UNTAET, with the PMU as the Executing Agency. The \nPMU, headed by an East Timorese project manager, was established under UNTAET\u2019s head of \ninfrastructure, and since August 2001 under the minister of MWPW. PMU comprises a chief \ntechnical adviser and international and local engineers. The consultant services were selected \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. However, the term \"member \ncountries\" under these guidelines for purposes of this project includes ADB member countries, \nEast Timor, and all donors and members of international organizations that have provided \ncontribution funds to the TFET.  \n \n45.  The  implementation  period  is  24  months,  commencing  in  May  2000;  most  project \nactivities are in the process of being completed. Project implementation reviews have been \ncarried out on a quarterly basis. All procurement under the EIRP is conducted in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  used  for  loan-financed  projects  and  selection  of \nconsultants selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n \n46.  Most  works  under  the  EIRP  are  within  existing  rights-of-way.  The  Government  is \nresponsible, if needed, to acquire or obtain rights to any land required on a timely basis in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s policies on resettlement and compensation14 and provide compensation \n(including for crops), as required, in accordance with ADB\u2019s relevant guidelines.  \n \nF.  Environmental and Social Measures \n47.  An initial environmental examination (IEE) was carried out for the EIRP. It assessed that \npotential environmental impacts would be related to construction activities and would be limited, \ntemporary,  and  reversible.  Environmental  impacts  are  being  mitigated  using  appropriate \nengineering practices. The IEE noted that the medium- and long-term impact of the EIRP is \npositive,  especially  in  promoting  economic  and  social  development  of  East  Timor  and  in \nfacilitating its reconstruction and development. A detailed environmental impact assessment \nwas not deemed necessary.  \n \n48.  Additionally, the ADB-funded TA for environmental impact assessment improvement15 is \ntraining six East Timorese in environmental impact assessment and management. To intensify \nthe  capacity  building  under  the  TA,  this  training  program  uses  the  EIRP  as  a  training \nopportunity.  \n \n49.  An initial social assessment prepared for the EIRP anticipated the Project would have a \nsignificant positive social impact and improve the quality of life. The EIRP does not result in any \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 1998. Handbook on Resettlement. Manila. \n15 ADB. 2000.

The beneficiary consultations continue to confirm widespread support \nfor the EIRP. All people are expected to benefit from the more reliable transport of goods, fuel, \nand food, and access to health services, as well as to the reviving markets in district towns and \nDili. The EIRP is also generating significant employment as the civil works are designed to \nmaximize the use of labor.  \n \nG.  Lessons Learned \n50.  The  EIRP  incorporates  considerable  flexibility  to  address  the  most  pressing \ninfrastructure requirements hindering facilitation of humanitarian aid and access to rural areas. \nThis  has  proven  necessary  due  to  the  changeable  weather  patterns,  unknown  geological \nconditions, landslip and road closure occurrences, and the EIRP aims to generate maximum \nemployment among the East Timorese.  \n \n51.  During the initial phases of implementation, most East Timorese were unemployed and \ndid not have income generating opportunities due to the collapse of all markets. The EIRP \ninitiated  works  under  expedited  work  orders  to  reduce  both  road  closures  and  immediate \npoverty  among  the  local  communities.  Additionally,  a  program  for  strengthening  local \ncontractors  was  undertaken  and  involved  significant  contractor  training  in  procurement \nprocesses, works management, and technical works. These thrusts involved a risk of needing to \nrevisit some of the work accomplished due to limited contractor capacity and poor technical \nquality of the works. The EIRP has since established a contractor prequalification system, which \nallows  timely  monitoring  of  contractor  performance  and  assigning  contractors  to  works \ncategories that are commensurate with their capacities. With additional time, the EIRP has also \nengaged  full  supervision  coverage  of  all  works,  again  involving  qualified  East  Timorese \nsupervisors. As a result, local skills have improved and currently represent typical standards in \nAsian countries.  \n \n52.  The  PMU  has  provided  services  exceeding  its  terms  of  reference  in  the  areas  of \nestablishing a functional department of infrastructure and providing information to the TFET \ndonors on project progress. It has indispensably supported budgeting and coordination among \ndonors. These services have been valuable to UNTAET and MWPW for identification of works, \npreparation  of  technical  designs  and  supervision  services,  tender  processes,  costing  and \nbudgeting,  and  general  support  for  emerging  issues,  e.g.,  structural  assessment  of  wharf \nstrength and institutional issues ranging from interpretation of standards and power pricing, to \nestablishment of institutions.  \n \nV.  THE EMERGENCY INFRASTRUCTURE REHABILITATION PROJECT (PHASE 2) \nA.  Rationale \n53.  While  East  Timor  inherited  a  relatively  dense  and,  to  a  large  extent,  sealed  road \nnetwork, road maintenance has been severely neglected. The inherent instability of the hilly \ntopography, the vulnerability of the coastal network to flooding and river realignment, and the \nsensitivity  of  road  pavements  to  poor  drainage,  all  combine  to  make  a  high  maintenance \nnetwork. The condition of the southern coastal road varies greatly: some sections are paved \nand are in good condition, while others are little more than tracks. The route crosses a number \nof large braided rivers with a combination of bridges and causeways. These causeways are \nvulnerable to the natural realignment of the waterways. The two major bridges, Punta Cassa \nand Zumalai, are incomplete. Five national and provincial north-south roads, all showing severe \nsigns of neglect, provide vehicular access from Dili and the northern east-west road to the south ", "12 \ncoast. During the rainy season, rivers flood these roads and interrupt the transport system. Data \non road conditions in East Timor demonstrate that a majority of district roads are in poor or very \npoor  condition,  and  that  a  strong  linkage  exists  between  road  network  conditions  and \ncommercial activity. \n \n54.  The road network remains fragile. Under normal conditions, the network would require a \nhigh level of maintenance. However, in the past seven years maintenance has been neglected, \nand in the years following the Asian crises since 1997, halted. Recurrent maintenance of gravel \nroads is much more costly than that of paved roads, even taking due account of the different \nservice  levels.  A  reduced  service  level  will  not  result  in  significant  savings  in  routine \nmaintenance costs. For example, the budget required to maintain a two-day access to Maliana \non a gravel surface is the same as that needed to maintain a half-day access using the present \npaved surface.  \n \n55.  The  EIRP  has  implemented  road  repair  works  in  addition  to  its  port  and  power \ncomponents. The road repair works have been invaluable in facilitating access to humanitarian \naid and peace and security. However, these have addressed immediate road closures and have \nonly partially been able to implement permanent engineering solutions that will reduce the \nmaintenance burden in the long term. This program requires additional resources. The EIRP is \nalso  supporting  longer-term  sector  development,  establishment  of  routine  maintenance \nmechanisms,  field  organization,  local  contracting  industry,  community  engagement,  and \ncapacity  building  for  sector  management.  Accordingly,  the  additional  funding  will  focus  on \nintensifying and extending the EIRP objective to restore the road network to a condition in which \nits economic life can be extended effectively through routine maintenance within available \nrecurrent funding levels. \n \nB.  Objectives  \n56.  In light of the forecasted recurrent budgetary constraints of the emerging East Timor, \nthe EIRP-2 will focus on stabilizing the road network and enabling it to be left in a condition from \nwhich it can be maintained with a relatively modest budget. The objective of the EIRP-2 is to \nsupport earthworks to diminish the annually recurring emergency requirement by reducing the \nbacklog maintenance requirement. It will also continue programs initiated under the EIRP to \nestablish a viable and efficient maintenance operation in East Timor and support technical \npreparation of the East Timorese maintenance service to carry out routine maintenance and \ncontract village groups. \n  \nC.  Scope \n57.  The  EIRP-2  will  provide  sustainable  road  works  that  reduce  annual  emergency \nrehabilitation requirements, and support for the establishment of a road maintenance regime. \nThe EIRP-2 scope includes \n \n(i)  preventive civil works and periodic maintenance,  \n \n(ii)  support for the establishment of a routine maintenance regime,  \n \n(iii)  detailed engineering, and \n \n(iv)  training and project management. \n ", "13 \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n58.  The total cost for the EIRP-2 is $9.0 million. The estimated costs of the components are \nsummarized in Table 1.  \n \nTable 1: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n($ million) \n   \n    Description  Foreign Cost\nA.  Civil Works \n1.

Funding for EIRP-2 will be provided on a grant basis from the TFET. Disbursements will \nbe sensitive to the TFET's cash receipts. This has been taken into account in packaging the \ncontracts. \n \nF.  Technical Approach  \n1.  Civil Works to Reduce Emergency Maintenance Requirement \n60.  Earthworks. The earthworks rehabilitation will support the reconstruction and minor \nrealignment of short road sections that have become unstable and have potential for technical \ncorrection. The soils, topography, and climate combined render the road network vulnerable to \nlandslides. Clearing and repairing these is a major component of the recurrent maintenance \nactivities. Annual repairs cannot effectively and economically reinstate the extensive landslip \nsites. More permanent solutions are required through improved alignment and fully engineered \nslope stabilization works and bioengineering techniques. This component will initiate a strategy \nfor preventive civil works for bench16 failures that are currently absorbing an unacceptable \nproportion of the recurrent budget. A tentative list of roads, from which sections will be identified, \nis in Appendix 5.  \n                                                 \n16 A bench failure is a slip of the ground beneath the road, where the road was originally formed by a cut into the \nhillside, caused commonly caused by a slide in the land fill placed on the sloping hillside to create a level bench for \nthe road. ", "14 \n \n61.  Bioengineering. Bioengineering techniques will be used to enhance slope stability. \nUnder these techniques, indigenous plants will be identified that will effectively reduce soil \nmoisture, resist surface erosion, and bind surfaces with strong and deep root systems. Once \nappropriate plants are identified, small nurseries will be established, and optimum planting and \ncare strategies identified, demonstrated, and implemented. \n \n62.  Periodic Maintenance. Periodic maintenance requirements cost about $12 million per \nannum. This reinstates road surfaces damaged by traffic abrasion and wet season erosion. \nMost roads have lost the integrity of their wearing surfaces. Consequently, they deteriorate too \nrapidly for routine maintenance to be effective, and have become impassable in wet weather. \nWhile an ideal periodic maintenance program would resurface about one seventh of the network \neach year, periodic road resurfacing is required at intervals of 5 to 10 years. However, no such \nprogram has been implemented during the past four years, and as much as 60% of the network \nis overdue for resurfacing treatment. Sites needing work most urgently will be identified and this \ntreatment strategy initiated. A small bridge replacement program will support the repair or \nreplacement of substandard and vulnerable major drainage structures on the main roads. \n \n2.  Support to Establish a Routine Maintenance Regime \n63.  Steep slopes, erodible sedimentary materials, and intense rainfall characterize the road \nnetwork environment. Under these conditions even minor slips and drain blockages result in \nroad sections becoming impassible after heavy rainfall. Under the EIRP village groups are \nresponsible  for  maintaining  the  road  drainage  system;  eventually,  funding  for  this  will  be \ntransferred to recurrent budget of the Government. The EIRP-2 provide technical support to \nestablish the community-based maintenance program and related technical capacity in the field \norganization. \n \n3.  Project Management and Training \n64.  The  EIRP-2  will  use  the  established  project  management  and  implementation \narrangements agreed for the EIRP, including the PMU reporting to the minister of MWPW. The \nPMU organization chart is in Appendix 6. The EIRP-2 will support the incremental time and \npersonnel requirements of the PMU. The PMU will engage geotechnical and design engineering \nservices and other short-term specialists, as required.  \n \n65.  Significant  skills  upgrading  is  needed  to  enable  the  East  Timorese  to  assume \nmanagerial and technical responsibility for implementing the routine and periodic maintenance \nregime, bio- and other engineering techniques, and financial and administrative accountability \nfor the sector. Under the EIRP, immediate, and medium- and long-term training requirements \nare being identified under a comprehensive human resource development assessment, which \nwill determine the specific skills required for the planned institutional arrangements for the \nsector (para. 24). The EIRP-2 will provide the technical training to establish technical capability \nof the road maintenance organization. However, this program is likely to require additional \nresources, and the PMU of EIRP-2 will make all efforts to identify cofinancing for this purpose.  \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n66.  Executing Agency. East Timor will be the recipient of the grant and MWPW will be the \nExecuting Agency. The PMU will be the project implementing agency and will report to the \nminister of MWPW. The PMU will program, administer, and coordinate daily activities. It will be ", "15 \nheaded by an East Timorese project manager and comprise an internationally recruited chief \ntechnical adviser, engineers, and an accountant. The selection of these will be subject to ADB's \napproval.  The  chief  technical  adviser  will  support  the  project  manager  with  EIRP-2 \nadministration and its contracts in accordance with ADB guidelines. The chief technical adviser \nwill be accountable to ADB for the quality and timeliness of project implementation. Engineers \nwill program and coordinate daily project activities, including design, supervision, procurement \nof goods and services, and management of civil works contracts. The international consultants \nwill train East Timorese counterparts in their areas of responsibility.  \n \n67.  Steering  Committee.  MWPW  will  establish,  in  consultation  with  other  relevant \nministries, a Steering Committee for the Project to involve a broader stakeholder representation \nin Project implementation. The Steering Committee will be convened every two months to \ndiscuss  and  resolve  emerging  issues  in  Project  implementation,  workplans,  review  and \ncomment on the Project reports, and the attainment of Project objectives. \n \n68.  Consultant Services. International and domestic consulting services will be required for \n(i) project management and (ii) detailed engineering. These consultant services will be selected \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. However, the term \"member \ncountries\"  under  these  guidelines  for  purposes  of  the  EIRP-2  will  include  ADB  member \ncountries, East Timor, and all donors and members of international organizations that have \nprovided contribution funds to the TFET. Individual consulting services will be selected for \nproject management. The PMU will be funded under the Project. The PMU's terms of reference \nare in Appendix 7. Slope stabilization requires geotechnical assessment of the soil conditions \nand detailed engineering. These services will be selected from an international firm. Outline \nterms of reference for detailed design are in Appendix 8. Advance procurement action for \ndetailed engineering was approved. \n \n69.  Procurement. All procurement for the EIRP-2 will be carried out using international and \nthe local competitive bidding and international shopping procedures in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement (footnote 5 and 7). Contractors will be eligible to tender for one or \nmore of the contract packages within their respective bid capacities. ADB approval prior to \naward will be required for all contracts. Tentative procurement packages are in Appendix 9. \n \n70.  Implementation Schedule. Programs under the EIRP-2 will be implemented over 18 \nmonths from June 2002 and be completed by December 2003. Advance procurement action for \nthe  selection  of  detailed  engineering  consultants  has  commenced  in  January  2001.  The \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 10.  \n \n71.  Disbursement. The EIRP-2 will be disbursed under the (i) imprest account, (ii) direct \npayment, and (iii) reimbursement methodology as provided under the guidelines pertinent to the \nEIRP  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  disbursement  guidelines.17  The  imprest  account \nestablished for the EIRP in Dili, East Timor will be used for disbursement of the supplemental \ngrant.  \n \n72.  Reporting and Accounts. Reporting requirements, accounts, and financial statements \nunder the additional funding will be established as determined under the EIRP. These include \ninception report, quarterly progress reports, audits, draft final report, and project completion \nreport. The PMU will establish the necessary accounts in Dili, and maintain separate accounts \nfor all expenditures under the EIRP-2, including its individual contracts and other components. \n                                                 \n17 ADB. 2001. Loan Disbursement Handbook. Manila. ", "16 \nThese bank accounts will be under the control of the chief technical adviser. The PMU will \nfurnish ADB with accounts and related financial statements reflecting the accounts for each \nproject-related contract. These financial statements will be audited using generally accepted \naccounting principles by auditors acceptable to ADB. The audited financial statements together \nwith the auditor\u2019s report will be forwarded to ADB within six months of the end of each related \nfiscal year. The PMU consultants will keep detailed records on the costing and expenditures of \nthe project components and will assist with reporting. \n \nH.  Environmental and Social Measures \n1.  Environmental Impact and Social Dimensions \n73.  The  EIRP-2  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B.  Accordingly,  an  initial \nenvironmental  examination  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Environmental \nGuidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects. The IEE indicates that while construction-related \nenvironmental  impact  is  unavoidable,  this  can  be  mitigated  using  appropriate  engineering \npractices. The IEE concludes that the EIRP-2 will result in a net benefit with costs of mitigation \nbeing outweighed by the envisaged benefits. The summary IEE is in Appendix 11. \n \n2.  Poverty Reduction and Social Assessment \n74.  The EIRP-2 is classified as a pro-poor growth intervention. An initial social assessment \n(ISA) and a poverty assessment were carried out. Significant positive impacts are expected for \nthe beneficiary communities. The civil works component is expected to enhance the reliability of \nroad access for communities around the country, including poor and vulnerable communities. \nThe establishment of a community-based road maintenance regime will provide a cost-effective \nmeans  for  ensuring  that  roads  are  maintained,  and  provide  a  mechanism  for  fostering \nsustainable incomes to the rural communities that have a strong need for income generating \nopportunities. Rural communities in East Timor have a strong structure of rural representation, \nand  village  representatives  are  capable  of  organizing  collective  activity,  such  as  road \nmaintenance.  The  initiative  is  supported  by  and  appropriate  to  the  local  conditions  and \ncommunity structures. The initial social assessment and poverty assessment are in Appendix \n12. \n \nI.  Risks \n75.  The EIRP-2 does not face any unusual risks. Funding has been committed from the \nTFET in the full amount of  $9.0 million. Due to the limited number of skilled East Timorese \nsupervisors and engineers, the EIRP-2 is focused to provide maximum opportunities for training. \nHowever,  the  lack  of  an  adequate  pool  of  technically  qualified  East  Timorese  can  delay \ncomplete transfer of the road agency to Timorese control. The PMU will support road agency \noperations and will seek sustainable solutions for staffing and training issues. Finally, road \nmaintenance and road sector services can be justified by the broad economic benefits of the \nsector, the road network\u2019s role inducing economic growth and development, as well as social \nnecessity. Road maintenance funding, while seen as expensive in East Timor\u2019s context, is \nrecognized  by  all  stakeholders  as  necessary  to  ensure  the  selected  growth  and  social \ndevelopment pattern of East Timor. The EIRP-2 will ensure adequate support to the budget \npreparation process and to information dissemination on the importance of road maintenance. \n ", "17 \nVI.  APPROVAL \n76.

Supplementary funding will be allocated to the Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation \nProject (EIRP)1 to finance the Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (Phase 2) (EIRP-\n2). EIRP-2 will support establishing an effective road maintenance capability in East Timor by \nundertaking earthworks and slope stabilization tasks on critical landslide hazard sites within the \nroad network, and a routine maintenance regime focusing on community involvement. Key \ncomponents of EIRP-2 are (i) preventative civil works and periodic maintenance, (ii) support for \nthe establishment of a routine maintenance regime based on local labor, and (iii) training and \nproject management. \n \n2.  The estimated cost is  $10 million. The Executing Agency is the Ministry of Water and \nPublic Works (MWPW) in East Timor. The EIRP-2 will commence during the third quarter of \n2002 and conclude during the fourth quarter of 2003, lasting approximately 18 months.  \n \n3.  The purpose of the Summary Initial Environmental Examination (SIEE) is to identify \nanticipated environmental of the EIRP-2 and the necessary mitigation measures, and to present \nrecommendations for institutional requirements for the monitoring of environmental impacts. The \nrelative  magnitude  of  the  identified  impacts,  and  costs  of  mitigation  are  provided  in  this \nappendix.  The SIEE is prepared on the basis of site visits, consultations, and examination of \nsecondary material prepared in East Timor between 1 to 15 March 2001. \n \n2.  Project Description \n \na.  Project Type \n \n4.  Infrastructure. The EIRP-2 will consist of slope stabilization works on critical landslide \nhazard sites within East Timor\u2019s road network, capacity building in terms of technical assistance \n(TA)  to  establish  a  community,  labor-based,  routine  maintenance  regime,  training  of  East \nTimorese counterparts, and project management. \n \n5.

", "Appendix 11  41\n \nc.  Need for the Project \n \n7.  Intense requirements are placed on the road network in East Timor, by the humanitarian \nassistance to inhabitants of towns and rural areas in the short term, and by the sustainable \neconomic development in the long term. Traditionally, the population is largely rural, although an \nincreasing degree of urbanization occurred during the previous authorities, particularly in the \n1990s. Rural dwellers are largely subsistence farmers, and suffer from widespread poverty, both \nin  terms  of  the  incidence  and  the  depth  of  poverty.  The  development  of  equitable  and \nsustainable  economic  opportunities  for  the  rural  poor  is  hampered  to  a  large  extent  by \naccessibility as, despite an extensive road network, road conditions are poor, vehicle operating \ncosts and hence transport fares are high, and vehicular access to markets severely restricted \n(some rural poor are known to walk very long distances to reach Dili or provincial markets).  \n \n8.  The provision and maintenance of a durable road network in East Timor is made difficult \nby  severe  geological  conditions,  the  considerable  extent  of  the  network  (approximately  1 \nkilometer [km] of road for each 3 square kilometer [km2] of land area), and the effects of \nprolonged neglect in the period leading up to the referendum of 1999. This makes the task of \nmanaging  and  implementing  a  road  maintenance  system  a  challenge  by  any  standards, \nparticularly as the management capacities are severely limited. \n \n9.  To support the future East Timorese roads authority in the challenge of tackling the \nbacklog of road maintenance caused by recent neglect, the strategy adopted for the EIRP-2 is \n(i) to address critical areas of instability within the network whose treatment threatens to take up \nan undue proportion of resources available for maintenance, (ii) to establish an efficient routine \nmaintenance regime that itself contributes to the reduction of rural poverty, and (iii) to provide \ncapacity building to help the future roads authority to acquire the necessary managerial and \ntechnical skills.  \n \nd.  Location \n \n10.  The location of civil works tentatively planned on priority road links throughout East \nTimor are provided in Table A11.1. However, given the nature of occurrence of landslide \nhazards, a degree of flexibility in site identification is required. \n \nTable A11.1: Roads Selected for Earthworks \n \nLink  Length (km) \nAituto to Same  37.0 \nBaucau to Border Viqueque  44.8 \nTibar to Border Ermera  18.5 \nBorder Ermera to Ermera  21.9 \nMaliana to Hauba  34.8 \nBorder Viqueque to Viqueque  19.4 \nBatugade to Maliana  45.1 \n \ne.  Size and Scope of Project Operations \n \n11.  The EIRP-2 comprises three components: \n ", "42  Appendix 11 \n(i)  Preventative Civil Works and Periodic Maintenance. The scope of works will \nencompass  fully  engineered  slope  stabilization  works  incorporating  bio-\nengineering techniques and minor realignment, with associated capacity building \nin prioritizing, planning, and executing the works to a high standard. The cost of \nthis component is estimated at $8,700,000, approximately 87 percent of the total \nEIRP-2 budget. \n(ii)  Support for establishing a Routine Maintenance Regime. The EIRP-2 will \ninclude the TA tasks to establish the field organization and capacity building for a \nroutine maintenance program whereby village groups are made responsible for \ncritical routine maintenance tasks, and rewarded and supervised appropriately \nfor this. \n(iii)  Training and Project Management. The Project Management Unit (PMU) will \nwill  provide  project  administration  support  for  preparation  and  administering \ntender processes and contracts, liaising with the Government and donor agency \nofficials. It will also upgrade skills of the future road maintenance organization \nenabling  it  to  undertake  its  managerial  and  technical  responsibilities  for \nimplementing routine and periodic maintenance. The project management unit \n(PMU) set up for the EIRP will manage the EIRP-2.  \n \n3.  Description of the Environment \n \n12.  Many of the key features of East Timor\u2019s environment are attributable to the fact that it is \na small island: \n \n(i)  Natural  phenomena  including  seismic  activity  and  landslips  affect  a  greater \nproportion of the landmass. Landslips in East Timor are commonplace. \n(ii)  Water  catchment  areas  are  smaller  with  effects  of  erosion  on  them \nproportionately  higher.  Watershed  management  in  East  Timor  is  a  key \nenvironmental issue. \n(iii)  Coastal  regions  take  up  a  higher  percentage  of  the  land.  Coastal  zone \nmanagement in East Timor is a key environmental issue.  \n(iv)  The flora and fauna are more specialized, prone to suppression by the invasion \nof  exotic  species,  and  include  a  higher  proportion  of  endemic  species.  The \nincidence of occurrence of exotic plant and animal species in East Timor is high, \nwhile its biodiversity is an important economic asset: a diverse array of nontimber \nforest products are traditionally gathered and traded. \n(v)  Societies  have  developed  in  relative  isolation  with  relatively  stronger,  more \ndistinctive cultures. Approximately 12 ethnic groups make up the indigenous \npopulation of East Timor. \n(vi)  The effects of immigration and emigration are more acutely felt.  \n \n13.  East Timor\u2019s environment is also dominated by precarious geological conditions, a moist \nclimate, and a weak institutional base for environmental management.  \n \na.  Physical Resources \n \ni.  Topography and Geology \n \n14.  Steep hills and valleys dominate the terrain within East Timor, with the main feature \nbeing a mountain ridge running east-west across the island. The island itself is situated at the \nnexus of four geological plates and two continental blocks, and is formed by tectonic plate ", "Appendix 11  43\nactivity that resulted in a large sedimentary rock mass being lifted above sea level. Three units, \ndistinguished by their age and origins, comprise the rock mass. The youngest of these, the \nsedimentary rock, dominates the top rock layers, while the underlying, older rock comprises \nschists, slates, and shales. The landscape is characterized by relative geological youth, the \ninherent instability of the sedimentary rock, and a high incidence of folds and faults. Because \nthe island is relatively young, the uplift process that has formed it is still in progress, and is \nestimated to be taking place at a rate of 10 millimeter (mm) per year.2 \n \n15.  The nature of the predominant, younger sedimentary rock is particularly relevant to the \nengineering of hill roads. These rocks feature conglomerates that are poorly consolidated, with \nweak matrices, as well as sandstone, siltstone, and weak alluvial deposits. These are variable in \nstrength and texture, and prone to failure triggered by the ongoing uplift process or torrential \nrain, quite apart from those caused by earthworks or agriculture.  \n \nii.  Climate \n \n16.   East Timor\u2019s climate is largely warm and moist, with considerable variations occurring \nwith  altitude  and  the  influence  of  the  mountain  chain  on  the  distribution  of  rainfall.  Mean \ntemperatures vary from around 28\u00baC at sea level to around 19\u00baC at the highest settlements, \nsome 1,400 meters above sea level. The seasons are quite even, and diurnal temperatures vary \nmore than mean monthly temperatures.  \n \n17.  The mountain chain intercepts precipitation, resulting in a drier zone on its northern side, \nwith a wet season of some 4 to 6 months commencing around November, while the land to the \nsouth  experiences  two  wet  seasons,  a  major  one  of  7  to  9  months  commencing  around \nNovember, and an additional, briefer one, between May and August. Significantly, much of the \nrain falls in brief, torrential falls, creating periods of intense hazard to property, agriculture, and \ninfrastructure from saturated soils and rapid surface water flows.  \n \nb.  Ecological Resources \n \n18.  Documented knowledge on the plants and animals, and their original communities in \nEast Timor, is relatively limited, although current research on East Timor\u2019s ecosystems suggests \nthat much local knowledge is undocumented. Little is therefore known about the value, in \neconomic or conservation terms, of natural resources on the island, particularly about the uses \nand properties of indigenous and even endemic plant and animal species. However, there are \nsigns that East Timor bears a diverse and unique natural resource base: Field workers within \nthe current Government system report a high level of knowledge of uses of plants for medicinal \nand other purposes. The basic geology of East Timor differs from that of its neighbors and is \ntherefore likely to have evolved a significantly different flora and fauna. In addition, the entire \nregion, where land masses have been brought together by tectonic plate movements, is of \nintense biogeographical interest. \n \n19.  The lack of knowledge extends to the national park and protected areas that have been \nestablished in East Timor. The law that existed under previous the Indonesian regime named 15 \nprotected areas. Under UNTAET, these areas were protected in Regulation No. 2000/19 of 30 \nJune  2000,  which  also  gave  UNTAET  broader  powers  for  the  protection  of  species  and \nreserves. Accurate and reliable data as to the boundaries of the protected areas is not available, \n                                                 \n2  Monk, K.A, de Fretes, Y and Reksodiharjo-Lilley, G. 1997. The Ecology of Nusa Tenggara and Maluku. Sydney: \nUniversity of New South Wales Press  ", "44  Appendix 11 \nand only approximate sketches of the boundaries exist. No management plans for the various \nareas appear to have been prepared. A compendium of statistics published by the Indonesian \nGovernment in 1998 suggests that the total extent of projected areas is around 64,000 hectares \n(ha), which to around 4.6 percent of the total land area.  \n \ni.  Vegetation \n \n20.  The present day vegetation cover is largely influenced by agriculture, land clearance, \nand grass burning. Throughout much of the island, particularly along the north coast, hillsides \nbear  mainly  grassland  savanna,  with  a  sparse  overstory  of  trees  such  as  Eucalyptus  sp, \nextensive grass growth, a limited shrub story, and an absence of young tree saplings in most \nplaces. More diverse growth occurs on steep stream banks and clefts within the hill landscape. \nWhere the vegetation is less disturbed by human settlement, a range of forest types occur \nmainly reflecting the rainfall distribution patterns. In driest areas to the north of the island, thorn \nforest occurs, giving way to dry deciduous forest in much of the coastal land. Mountain areas \nfeature  moist  deciduous  forest,  with  evergreen  rainforest  occurring  in  pockets.  Roadside \nvegetation, particularly in the northern part of the island, features a high level of invasion by \naggressive exotic weed species, e.g, Tithonia diversifolia and Lantana camara, both common \nnoxious weed species with an extremely wide distribution. \n \nii.  Fauna \n \n21.  The island\u2019s fauna includes both indigenous and introduced species. The main threat to \nthe populations of indigenous species, is the loss of the habitat in which they evolved. Extensive \nconversion of forestland since early colonial occupation has therefore resulted in reductions of \nthe  populations  of  indigenous  fauna  species.  Introduced  animals  include  deer,  civets,  and \nrodents; a number of Australian bird species have also been introduced.  \n \n22.  A number of rare species of interest occur among the island\u2019s mammal, bird, insect, and \nfish populations. The scientific interest in the fauna of East Timor and its island neighbors, \nalthough little studied, is intensified by the fact that two major biogeographical regions, Oriental \nand Australian, meet in the region. Separated during early geological time, the two regions \ndeveloped quite distinct fauna. Although the fauna are understood to have merged, in terms of \nspecies composition, as the two regions came together, significant differences continue to be \nobserved.  \n \nc.  Marine Ecosystems \n \n23.  A number of marine ecosystems can be found around the immediate coast of East \nTimor, namely coral reefs and seagrass beds, with mangrove forests, rocky sea bottoms, and \nmuddy flats in the intertidal zone. While a significant fishing industry has never developed in the \ncountry, these ecosystems are of considerable scientific and conservation value. Many of the \ncreatures of such ecosystems are vulnerable to changes in water turbidity caused by sediment \ndeposition.  \n \nd.  Human and Economic Development \n \n24.  The status of human and economic development in East Timor has largely been shaped \nby Portuguese colonization, between 1562 and 1974, and also by the ensuing Indonesian \noccupation until late 1999. Early Portuguese colonists established trade in commodities such as \nsandalwood, timber, honey, and beeswax. Consistent with the actions of many colonial powers ", "Appendix 11  45\nof the period, little effort was made to curb overexploitation and reserves of sandalwood and \npossibly certain timber species were brought to near extinction by the early 1900s. During the \nfour centuries of Portuguese colonization, Catholicism became the dominant religion, and a \ncolonial system of administration was established. The Portuguese colonial period ended in \n1974,  and  the  Indonesian  government  took  power  following  an  invasion  in  1975.  While \nIndonesia invested in the nation\u2019s infrastructure, much of this appears to have been for the \npurpose of countering local resistance to their occupation. To facilitate the control of resistance \namong tribal groups, particularly in remote areas, the Indonesian government built an extensive \nroad network, and allegedly imposed migration of tribal people within East Timor so as to \nfragment traditional group structures and weaken resistance. The Indonesian occupation came \nto an end in late 1999 when a referendum demonstrated that most East Timorese wanted \ncomplete  independence  from  Indonesia.  This  result  triggered  intense  violence  that  led  to \nnumerous  deaths,  and  the  decimation  of  the  country\u2019s  infrastructure  and  services,  with \nwidespread destruction of public buildings and utilities as well as private homes. With the \ninstallation of UNTAET in September 1999, an emergency rehabilitation effort has ensued, \nfocusing primarily on restoring infrastructure required to distribute humanitarian aid and on \nredeveloping durable infrastructure and the capacity for its maintenance. As of 20 May 2002, \nUNTAET has handed the administration over to an indigenous Government and a reduced \nUnited Nations Mission in East Timor has been agreed to be retained to ensure inability and \npolitical stability of East Timor. \n \n25.  East Timor has always been poor and was one of the poorest parts of Indonesia, itself a \npoor country. Indonesia\u2019s own economic performance was influenced by the Asian financial \ncrisis in the late 1990s, which, with the fall of the rupiah, led to very low incomes for East \nTimorese people prior to 1999. Coupled with inflation, the Asian crisis caused severe poverty. \nAs a result of post referendum violence, some 24 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) may \nhave been lost in 1999.3 \n \n26.  Efforts to gather economic, demographic, and other information of key importance to the \ndesign and implementation of development programs in East Timor are currently under way, \nand include the World Bank-managed Community Empowerment and Local Governance Project \n(CEP),  and  the  survey  of  sucos,4  managed  by  the  Census  and  Statistics  department  of \nUNTAET. CEP staff report that information gathered prior to the referendum appears to be \nlargely inaccurate.  \n \n27.  The population of East Timor is approximately 800,000, which includes refugee groups \nliving in West Timor, nearly all of whom are in the process of returning to East Timor.  \n \ne.  Ethnicity and Culture \n \n28.  As is commonly the case with small island nations, the population of East Timor displays \nstrong cultural diversity and identity. Prior to the referendum, about 78 percent of the population \nwere  from  12  indigenous  ethnic  groups,  20  percent  were  Indonesian  and  2  percent  were \nChinese.5 Within the ethnic groups, diversity occurs at the suco level, and is illustrated by \nconsiderable  linguistic  diversity.  Tetum  is  the  dominant  indigenous  language  although \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2000. East Timor Rapid Assessment of Social Conditions.

Fieldwork for the survey of sucos will be \ncomplete in late March 2001, with data to be analyzed and made available during May 2001. The survey \nquestionnaire  gathers  demographic  information,  economic  information,  and  information  on  the  status  of \ninfrastructure and essential services. \n5  United Nations. 2000. Building Blocks for a Nation: Common Country Assessment for East Timor.  ", "46  Appendix 11 \nPortuguese  has  been  adopted  as  an  official  national  language.  Tribal  culture  is  most \nconspicuously in evidence from the traditional handicraft industry. One of the main handicraft \nproducts produced by rural people is a woven cloth with a wide range of colored designs \nspecific to different tribal groups.  \n \n29.  The EIRP-2 will therefore involve cooperation with a diverse beneficiary group, in terms \nof ethnicity, language, and culture. \n \nf.  Quality of Life Values \n \n30.  The widespread violence that followed the 1999 referendum caused the destruction of \nmost essential services that impinge directly on the quality of life, such as basic infrastructure \n(including water and sanitation facilities), health services, education services, and opportunities \nfor employment and income generation. \n \n31.  The destruction appears to have spared some cultural assets dating back to the colonial \nera, including some more recent churches and religious monuments, which were largely left \nuntouched. The deaths and displacement of people had a strong negative impact on culture. In \naddition to recent dramatic events, the influence of both Indonesian and prolonged Portuguese \nrule have taken their toll on local culture. Despite these influences, awareness and pride in local \nculture remains. The development of a capacity to maintain roads and other infrastructure will \nhelp underline the cultural integrity and independence of the people.  \n \n4.  Screening and Valuation of Potential Environmental Impacts \n \na.  Approach \n \n32.  Potential environmental impacts were identified through site visits to selected roads \nwithin the network where more serious landslide hazards are known to occur, and extensive \nconsultations with key informants and stakeholders in Dili and the provinces. Two staff of the \nEnvironmental Protection Unit were involved in field visits and discussions carried out during the \nscreening of impacts.  \n \n33.  The  anticipated  negative  environmental  impacts  are  associated  primarily  with  the \nconstruction phase, are temporary, and given specified mitigation, judged not significant. A \nnumber of positive environmental impacts are associated with the EIRP-2. The magnitude of \nimpacts and mitigation measures have been evaluated in quantitative and qualitative terms for \npurposes of project selection, and to identify environmental costs.  \n \nb.  Overview of Environmental Impacts and Issues \n \n34.  In focusing on the amelioration of major landslide sites and efficient road maintenance \nthe EIRP-2 is by nature an environmentally friendly initiative. The screening process has not \nyielded any effects that may cause it to carry undue environmental cost.  \n \n35.  Potentially, the EIRP-2 has highly significant indirect environmental benefits. It also has \npotential for setting national standards as an intervention directed to reduce impact of erosion \nand, particularly, through the management mechanism implemented to mitigate construction-\nassociated  environmental  impact.  These  standards  can  be  set  through  rigorous  contract \nsupervision to ensure high standards of performance by the contractor, in terms of adherence to \nthe  principle  of  best  practice.  Contractors  will  ensure  a  high  standard  of  environmental ", "Appendix 11  47\nmanagement and safety in their work, and will substantially mitigate most construction effects, \nas well as effects associated with maintenance. \n \n36.  One very important aspect of the principle of best practice is the issue of side tipping of \nspoil material. Although widespread in hilly areas throughout Asia, the practice of side tipping of \nexcavated  material  or  landslip  material  is  extremely  damaging.  Loose  spoil  deposited  on \nhillsides rapidly forms rills and gullies, which concentrate runoff water causing gullies to expand \nand cut into the original ground. The effect is made worse by the smothering of vegetation, \nwhich plays an important part in slope protection and stabilization. As it travels downstream, the \nspoil increases sediment load and erosive power of waterways, potentially damaging aquatic \necosystems and agriculture as well.  \n \n37.  The effects of side tipping can be mitigated against by ensuring that all loose material \narising from excavations or from the clearance of landslips is transported to safe tip sites where \nit can be retained, and even used as a productive growing medium. The total cost of mitigation \nfor the EIRP-2 is tentatively estimated, in part II of this report at under $50,000. This represents \na  very  minor  addition  to  the  project  cost.  In  the  long  term,  the  institution  of  good  spoil \nmanagement will set high national standards, for which, at present, there is little precedent in \nAsia.  \n \n5.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program \n \na.  Existing Situation and Planned Developments \n \n38.  Legislation covering environmental impact assessment and monitoring of projects was \nenacted by the Indonesian Government and has been upheld in East Timor under UNTAET \nregulations. However, the institutions to which the law refers are no longer in place, and current \ntechnical capacity to enact the legislation very weak. The existing environmental authority is the \nEnvironmental Protection Unit of the Ministry of Development and Economic Affairs, which \nengages four local staff.  \n \n39.  To commence the task of installing a permanent capacity for environmental protection \ncovering all sectors, a TA for Environmental Impact Assessment Improvement6 will provide: \n \n(i)  training  of  East  Timorese  professionals,  through  a  formal  in-country  and \noverseas courses and on-the-job training, involving the monitoring of the EIRP;  \n(ii)  review  of  environmental  legislation  and  regulations,  for  compliance  with \ninternational standards; \n(iii)  development  of  an  institutional  development  plan  for  environmental \nmanagement; and \n(iv)  preparation of an environmental profile for East Timor. \n \n40.  This  TA  will  put  forward  an  appropriate  institutional  structure  for  environmental \nmonitoring  and  enforcement.  Until  fully  adopted  by  the  future  East  Timorese  government, \ninterim measures should be taken by project supervisory staff. \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to East Timor for Transport Sector Restoration. Manila. ", "48  Appendix 11 \n \nb.  Interim Requirements \n \n41.  At the time of implementing the EIRP-2, a core team of East Timorese professionals will \nhave received training in the skills required to monitor the environmental impacts of projects. \nHowever, these individuals will only have a brief period of relevant professional experience to \ncall upon for the necessary monitoring work. Therefore the responsibility for environmental \nmonitoring  of  the  EIRP-2  should  be  shared  by  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  and \ninternational  staff  in  the  PMU  should  provide  guidance  in  technical  and  legal  aspects  of \nenvironmental monitoring. Accordingly, PMU staff should \n \n(i)  acquaint themselves with developments in relevant legislation for East Timor, \n(ii)  assume  responsibility  for  undertaking  the  inspection  tasks  for  environmental \nmonitoring under the legislation, and  \n(iii)  hold regular dialogue with the future environmental authority and report formally \non the findings of environmental monitoring activities.  \n \n6.  Findings and Recommendations \n \n42.  The environmental impact screening process has identified that no significant adverse \nenvironmental impacts are envisaged, given the recommended mitigation measures. However, \nsubstantial environmental benefits can be expected to arise from the institution of the road \nmaintenance regime, and introduction of the practice of transporting spoil material to safe \ntipping sites. These measures would significantly reduce environmental damage caused by road \nslope  failures,  and  ultimately  reduce  the  effects  of  normal  baseline  levels  of  landslide \noccurrence. The following mitigation measures are required: \n \n(i)  The  supervising  engineer  must  acquire  the  services  of  a  plant  ecologist  to \nidentify suitable indigenous plants for use in the application of bioengineering \ntechniques as part of the civil works component of the EIRP-2. The ecologist will, \nthrough consultation with villagers, identify shrub and grass species that are \nindigenous, deep rooting, and noninvasive. For each candidate plant identified, \ninformation  on  propagation  methods  must  be  gathered,  and  plans  made  for \nnursery rearing of seedlings. If no suitable indigenous species can be identified, \nthen  suitable  exotic  species  should  be  proposed,  along  with  specific \nmanagement  recommendations.  The  ecologist  should  also  work  with  the \nengineer\u2019s staff to identify work sites and determine requirements. The plants \nand nursery plans should cover major slip sites, fill sites, and quarry sites and \nborrow pit sites to be rehabilitated.  \n(ii)  The supervising engineer should prepare a list of approved tip sites. \n(iii)  The contractor should be required to produce an environmental management \nplan,  detailing  procedures  for  spoil  management,  quarry  and  borrow  pit \nrehabilitation,  maintenance  of  vehicles  and  plant,  dust  control,  noise  control \n(where appropriate) site traffic management, waste storage and disposal, and \nstaffing requirements for the implementation of the plan.  \n(iv)  The contractor should be required to produce a work and traffic safety plan, and \nacquire adequate equipment to allow safe operation on steep, hazardous work \nsites. \n(v)  The  supervising  engineer  should  be  empowered  to  approve  the  contractor\u2019s \nenvironmental management plan and safety plan, and to stop the work in the \nevent of noncompliance with the plans.  ", "Appendix 11  49\n \n(vi)  PMU staff should provide training to staff of the future roads authority on the \ncontrol  of  the  contractor\u2019s  performance  relating  to  environmental  and  safety \naspects, and in implementing the principle of best engineering practice.  \n \n7.  Conclusion \n \n43.  Given the effective implementation of the specified mitigation measures, no negative \nsignificant  environmental  impacts  are  envisaged  from  the  EIRP-2.  Accordingly,  no  further \nenvironmental assessment is required and this report is submitted as the completed EIA report. \n \nB.  Valuation of Environmental Impacts \n \n1.   Purpose  \n \n44.  This evaluation of environmental impacts of the EIRP-2 was carried out using quantity, \ncost,  and  price  estimates  relating  to  environmental  impacts,  supplemented  by  qualitative \nassessments. The purpose of the valuation of environmental effects is to \n \n(i)  input environmental benefits and costs in to the benefit-cost analysis for the \nEIRP-2. \n(ii)  assess the effect of proposed mitigation on project cost \n(iii)  arrive at a net environmental cost or benefit for the EIRP-2. \n \n2.  Screening of Impacts \n \n45.  In accordance with ADB guidelines,7 each impact identified in the screening process for \nthe environmental assessment was screened using the following rationale: \n \n(i)  Impacts judged to be very small were excluded, with reasons, from quantitative \nassessment. \n(ii)  Impacts  for  which  a  high  degree  of  uncertainty  exists  as  to  their  governing \nparameters were described qualitatively and quantitatively to the extent feasible. \n(iii)  Impacts  whose  effects  may  be  valued  were  assessed  using  an  appropriate \nmethod. \n(iv)  In the case of impacts that were judged to be mitigated, the costs of mitigation \nmeasures  were  estimated,  and  the  expected  impacts  that  may  occur  in  the \nabsence of mitigation were described as quantitatively as possible.  \n \n46.  According to this rationale, the following impacts were valued or described: \n \n(i)  Beneficial Impacts: (a) effects of improved slope stability at landslide hazard \nareas following construction; (b) safe treatment of spoil arising from naturally \noccurring  landslips;  (c)  effects  of  improved  routine  maintenance;  and  (d) \nincreased  populations  of  indigenous  plants,  resulting  from  their  use  for \nbioengineering works. \n \n(ii)  Mitigated Adverse Impacts: (a) generation of spoil from construction, (b) effects \nof associated with bio-engineering work, (c) effects of quarrying and borrowing, \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 1997. Environmental Impact Assessment for Developing Countries in Asia. ADB, Manila. ", "50  Appendix 11 \n(d) land and water contamination from construction depots and vehicles, (e) Land \nand  water  contamination  from  maintenance  depots  and  vehicles,  (f)  safety \nhazards associated with construction, and (g) safety hazards associated with \nmaintenance operations. \n \n(iii)  Residual  Adverse  Impacts:  (a)  land  take  for  realignment  work  and  the \ninstallation of retaining and revetment structures, and (b) disruption to traffic \nduring construction. \n \n3.  Valuation of Impacts \n \n47.  The EIRP-2 targets to control of major and minor slope failure hazards to minimize their \neffect on the integrity of the transport network and the environment as a whole. The valuation of \nbenefits  is  based  on  the  expected  quantities  and  values  associated  with  the  with-project \nscenario,  compared  with  the  expected  environmental  consequences  of  the  without-project \nscenario. For the with-project scenario, under which no special attention is expected to be given \nto preventing slope failures, uncertainty exists as to the precise scale and frequency of slope \nfailures, the level of resources and effectiveness of preventative measures available, and the \nquantity  and  nature  of  environmental  damage  caused  by  stressors  such  as  landslide  slip \nmaterial. This valuation exercise compares and contrasts the anticipated environmental benefits \nand costs using both qualitative and quantitative estimates. The approach taken is therefore to \nevaluate project benefits mainly qualitatively, to estimate the cost of mitigation of adverse \nenvironmental impacts that would arise as a result of the EIRP-2, and to quantify any residual \nnegative  environmental  impacts  as  far  as  possible.  To  estimate  mitigation  costs,  a  set  of \nassumptions for locations and quantities of project work has been made. These are summarized \nin para. 87 of this appendix. \n \na.  Beneficial Impacts \n \ni.  Effects of Improved Slope Stability at Landslide Hazard Areas \nFollowing Construction \n \n48.  As a result of the severe geological conditions of the island, described in paras. 14-15 of \nthis  appendix  potential  landslide  sites  are  numerous,  and  variable  in  scale.  The  technical \nchallenges  involved  in  identifying  incipient  landslide  sites  and  developing  appropriate \nengineering solutions based on site investigations and soil tests, will allow a large number of \nsuch sites to be effectively treated by using geotechnical engineering measures such as the \nconstruction of retaining and revetment structures. The scope of works extends to the use of \nbioengineering techniques to enhance the effectiveness of structures and treat smaller risk \nsites. The project works are therefore expected to reduce the costs of maintaining the road \nnetwork through early and effective treatment of existing and potential hazard sites.  \n \n49.  The direct environmental benefit envisaged from this work is the protection of land that is \nat risk to damage from landslides. This is highly significant. In addition, there are indirect \nbenefits  associated  with  the  retention  of  material  that  would  otherwise  be  released  into \nwatersheds  as  a  result  of  the  landslides.  These  include  the  prevention  of  damage  to \necosystems,  and  agricultural  and  residential  land  through  sediment  transport  in  flood  and \nstream flows; and the effects on marine ecosystems of the release of soil particles into the sea.  \n \n50.  The receptors of soil and rock debris from landslides are terrestrial ecosystems, marine \necosystems,  farms,  and  homes.  In  view  of  the  occurrence  of  naturally  occurring  landslips ", "Appendix 11  51\ntriggered by ongoing uplift of the island and severe storm events, affected ecosystems, both \nterrestrial and marine, have likely evolved under conditions of repeated deposition of soil and \nrock debris produced by landslides. In view of this, no significant impact on receptor ecosystems \nis envisaged. \n \n51.  In the case of both farms and homes, severe risks are associated with occasional \nlandslide events. Potentially severe landslide areas will likely be successfully treated under the \nEIRP-2. Any single successful treatment of a potential landslide is likely to prevent catastrophic \nloss of productive land and homes downstream. The effects on both agricultural productivity and \nprivate homes is therefore highly significant. While the location and extent of damage to land \nand property cannot be reliably predicted, the cost of road reinstatement alone following such \nan event is likely to exceed $100,000. The environmental cost is therefore rated as highly \nsignificant. \n \nii.  Effects of Improved Routine Maintenance \n \n52.  Under the EIRP-2, a routine maintenance regime will be established that will seek to \ninvolve communities in organizing and carrying out routine maintenance work. Such a regime \nwill  potentially  result  in  improved  vigilance  and  more  rapid  corrective  action  for  incipient \nproblems such as drain blockages, undercutting of retaining walls, and pot-hole development. \nThis rapid corrective action to incipient problems will lower the incidence of larger problems \nsuch  as  gully  formation  and  the  scouring  out  of  structures.  Besides  reducing  the  cost  of \nmaintenance of the road network, this will also result in reductions in the release of spoil into \nwatersheds. The impact on agricultural productivity and rural homes is rated as significant. The \nincreased cost of repair to the road in the absence of an efficient maintenance system may be \nhigh in the medium and long term, in the order of $10,000 to $100,000. \n \niii.  The Effect of Increased Populations of Indigenous plants  \n \n53.  Increases in the populations of indigenous plants for bioengineering purposes has direct \nand indirect effects. The direct effects are improved soil conservation on slopes, and improved \navailability of minor products for small-scale rural income generation. \n \n54.  The indirect effects are conservation of biodiversity by initiating a process of ecological \nsuccession  that  will  allow  communities  of  indigenous  plants  and  the  associated  fauna  to \nreestablish, and enhanced aesthetic appeal of the road environment. \n \n55.  Of these impacts, the availability of minor products constitutes a potentially measurable \nchange in productivity, given the following assumptions: \n \nThe species used for bioengineering, or those that recolonize the site as a result of the planting \nof indigenous species, yield harvestable products. \nSafe access to the growing site is possible, even though planting is to be done on steep slopes \nProducts can be harvested without destruction of the source plants.  \n \n56.  With reference to the ADB guidelines (footnote 6), a change in productivity approach is \nidentified as a suitable valuation method for the increase in availability of minor products. \nHowever, data on prices and volumes of suitable products is not currently available in East \nTimor, although a number of studies such as a forthcoming household economic survey, will \nbegin to build a body of relevant information on economic activity of this sort. As an alternative \nhowever, a non-country-specific valuation of medicinal plants from a representative hectare of ", "52  Appendix 11 \nrainforest is presented in valuation tables in the ADB workbook on Economic Evaluation of \nEnvironmental Impacts.8 The valuation table cites a 1993 study, which, using a discount rate of \n5 percent and a long time horizon, gives a present value of up to $420 per ha. In view of the fact \nthat the total area to be planted with indigenous plants is some 1.55 ha, the total value of the \nbenefit is minor.  \n \nb.  Mitigated Adverse Impacts \n \ni.  Generation of Spoil from Construction \n \n57.  Description of impacts if not mitigated. The total volume of spoil to be produced by \nthe EIRP-2 is estimated at 4,200 cubic meters (m3). This spoil, if released down slope from \nproject sites, will act as a stressor to the environment. Principal receptors of the stressors will be \nsmall  farmers  and  landowners  within  the  watershed,  any  protected  areas  and  the  marine \necosystem where the spoil is finally released into the sea. \n \n58.  Assuming terrestrial and marine ecosystems have evolved under conditions where such \nlandslides are commonplace, the cost of release of landslide soil and debris on forest and park \nland, and into the sea is considered negligible. However, spoil arising from the project work and \nfrom relatively minor landslips occurring during the project period will both affect property and \nproductive land downstream, and increase the risk of further slope failures.  \n \n59.  The effects of side tipping on hill roads generally are widely apparent throughout Asia \nand the Pacific. Tipped material smothers vegetation, which is often playing a crucial role in \nsupporting the slope. The material rapidly forms rills and gullies, which cut into the slopes, often \nbelow the original surface level. In more fragile hill areas, such as those in East Timor, this gully \nformation is capable of triggering substantial failures.  \n \n60.  In the absence of information on location, frequency, and magnitude of sites where side \ntipping will occur, the cost of this practice may best be assessed by means of a large-scale \nmonitoring program, perhaps with research sites in several countries. However, in view of the \nfact that this practice can cause severe additional failures, the cost of uncontrolled tipping is \ntherefore, potentially in excess of the cost of rectification of further failures. This may exceed \n$100,000 over the life of the EIRP-2. \n \n61.  Cost of mitigation. The effects of spoil generation can be mitigated by haulage of spoil \nto approved tip sites, where slopes are not at risk to damage from the effects of deposited spoil. \n \n62.  Based on the key assumptions (paras. 89-90) volumes of soil and soft rock excavation \ncan be estimated, for the EIRP and the EIRP-2. Based on observations made during site visits \nduring the IEE mission, spoil must be hauled distances of 1 to 30 kilometers (km) between the \nsource and a suitable tip site.  \n \n63.  Assuming heavy trucks will be used for the haulage of spoil, and that these can carry 5 \ncubic meters of spoil, the cost can be estimated using vehicle operating cost data given in the \nFeasibility Study for the Transport Sector Restoration Project.9 These data show that the unit \nvehicle economic operating costs of heavy trucks ($ per 1,000 vehicles per km) range between \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 1996.

", "Appendix 11  53\n$701  and  $1,618,  or  $0.70  and  $1.62  per  vehicle  per  km.  Assuming  that  a  round  trip  is \nnecessary  for  spoil  disposal  and  that  trucks  always  run  to  full  capacity,  then  the  cost  of \ntransporting each cubic meter for 1 km ranges between $0.14 and $0.32.  \n \n64.  The cost of assuming that haulage distances range between 1 and 30 km, and that a \nreturn trip is necessary for disposal, then the average distance can be taken as 31 km.  \n \n65.  The total volume of excavation arising from project works is estimated at 4,200 m3. The \ncost of haulage of this material to safe tip sites is therefore estimated to range between 4,200 x \n31 x 0.14 = $18,288 and 4,200 x 31 x 0.32 = $41,664.  \n \n66.  In addition to the cost of haulage of excavated material, an allowance should be made \nfor the cost of haulage of spoil arising from normal slope failures. In the worst case, this may \nexceed the total cost of excavation for the EIRP-2. In the absence of any means of estimating \nthe quantity of such material, a figure of $50,000 is recommended. \n \nii.  Effects Associated with Bioengineering Work \n \n67.  Description of impacts if not mitigated. Though designed primarily as environmental \nenhancement measures, bioengineering can result in a small degree of environmental damage \nif  planting  stock  is  gathered  from  a  single  source  area,  or  if  weed  species  are  used  for \nbioengineering measures. \n \n68.  When planting material such as grass or shrub cuttings or seeds are gathered from a \nsingle area, damage can arise as a result both of removal of vegetation and disturbance of the \nsoil. In both cases, particularly in steep locations where the work sites will be located, the \nremoval of plants and consequent soil disturbance may result in minor slope failures, particularly \nif root stock is being collected. The risk of environmental damage is therefore significant.  \n \n69.  In general, good plants for bioengineering will be vigorous, firm rooting, and hardy. \nThese  properties  are  largely  shared  by  invasive  weed  species  that,  if  used  prolifically  for \nbioengineering,  serve  to  increase  the  seed  source  of  these  plants  and  deepen  their \nestablishment in the area, at the expense of indigenous and even endemic species. In an island \nsituation such as East Timor, this effect can be significant.  \n \n70.  Cost of mitigation. Two mitigation measures are identified, (i) carrying out all plant \npropagation in nurseries, and (ii) engaging a plant ecologist to carry out investigations and \nprovide recommendations as to species to use and means of propagation. \n \n71.  Nursery sites will need to be within some 50 km of work sites, and therefore three sites \nare likely to be required for the EIRP-2, one to serve the Batugade to Zumalai road, one to \nserve the Tibar to Ermera road, and one to serve the Baucau to Viqueque road. The total area \nof planting envisaged (11,000 m2) is not great, but plants should also be available for the \nmaintenance program as well. 50 m2 of grass and shrub beds in each nursery will be adequate. \nThe total land requirement for each of these nurseries will be some 200 m2, to include walkways \naround each bed, and adequate siting for a small shed and water tank. The costs anticipated for \neach nursery are given in Table A11.2. ", "54  Appendix 11 \n \nTable A11.2: Estimated Cost of Bioengineering Nurseries \n \nItem  Rate  Quantity  Total \nLand rent  Nominal $50   $100 \nper year for 2 years \nConstruction of beds  $5 per sq m  100  $500 \nConstruction of water tank  $100  1  $100 \n(per m3 of masonry) \nFencing  $10 per m  60  $600 \nConstruction of potting shed  Nominal $50  $50 \n(bush materials) \nTotal per nursery  $1,350\n  m3=cubic meter. \nSource: Staff estimates. \n \n72.  The total cost for three nurseries is therefore estimated at $4,050.  \n \n73.  A plant ecologist will be required to undertake the following: \n \n(i)  Review existing scientific information, including botanical and ethno-botanical \ninformation, on plants available in East Timor. \n(ii)  Undertake field surveys and consultations with villagers to identify candidate \nplants for use in bioengineering applications \n(iii)  In the event that suitable plants cannot be identified, propose suitable exotic, \nnoninvasive species \n(iv)  Determine,  as  far  as  possible,  information  on  seed  production  times,  seed \ncollection and treatment, and/or vegetative propagation methods \n(v)  Design  trials  for  the  use  of  the  species  identified  to  determine  suitable \npropagation methods and ease of establishment under site conditions \n(vi)  Select suitable nursery sites and design nurseries to produce sufficient quantities \nof high-quality planting stock for the bioengineering works of the EIRP-2. \n(vii)  Recommend  plant  tending  and  management  measures  for  the  plants  and \ntechniques to be used for bioengineering. \n \n74.  About two person-months of international consulting are required for the fulfillment of this \ntask, along with the provision of a vehicle and budget to use information resources located at \ninternational research institutions (Table A11.3). \n \nTable A11.3: Estimated Cost of Technical Advisory Services for Bioengineering \n \nItem  Rate  Quantity  Amount\nInternational consultant (including per diem and  $24,000 2 months  $48,000\ntravel costs) \nVehicle hire  $2,000  2 months  $4,000\nBudget for library charges, dispatch of samples, and  sum    $3,000\nfees with international research institutions \nTotal  $55,000\nSource: Staff estimates. ", "Appendix 11  55\n \niii.  Effects of Quarrying and Borrowing \n \n75.  Description of impacts if not mitigated. All quarries and borrow pits will probably be \nlocated in hilly terrain, the baseline risk to slope failures is high. Excavation activities will leave \nsteep walls around each quarry or borrow pit site, which will be in a less stable state than it was \nprior to excavation, particularly where quarry or pit walls are composed of soil, or contain soil \ncuts. This will result in possible collapse of the quarry pit site, causing land-take and the release \nof spoil into watersheds. Such impacts are potentially significant. \n \n76.  Cost of mitigation. Bioengineering techniques may be used to rehabilitate quarry and \nborrow pit sites, assuming that excavation operations are supervised to ensure that walls are \nleft at an even angle.  \n \n77.  The total estimated volume of material to be sourced from quarries and borrow pits \n(paras. 96-97) are \n \nstone for gabion: 6,500 m3, and  \ngraded material for wall backfill: 4,475 m3. \n \n78.  Assuming quarries and borrow pits are situated on slopes, the area of quarry walls to be \nrehabilitated  can  be  assumed  to  be  approximately  equal  to  the  volume  of  material  to  be \nremoved. The total area to be rehabilitated is therefore estimated at approximately 11,000 m2.  \n \n79.  A suitable method of quarry rehabilitation is the seeding of slopes using grass and shrub \nseed, followed by the placement of a mulch, held in place with netting. Based on discussions \nheld with resource people involved in construction and planting activities in East Timor, a unit \nrate ranging from $0.20 to $0.70 per m2 is envisaged. Thus, the total cost of quarry and borrow \npit rehabilitation is expected to range between $2,200 and $15,400. \n \nc.  General Mitigation Measures: Training \n \n80.  The supervising engineers will bear the responsibility of ensuring that contractors adhere \nto their environmental and safety plans, as well as to international standards of construction \nmanagement.  To  ensure  that  the  capacity  exists  for  this  function,  during  the  EIRP-2  and \nsubsequently, a core team of counterpart staff should receive training, both at international \ninstitutions and on-the-job, in supervision and monitoring of the performance of contractors in \ncompliance with environmental standards (Table A11.4).  \n \nTable A11.4: Estimated Cost of Training \n \nItem  Amount \nTraining of one professional at an international training  $25,000 \ninstitute for a suitable short course (3 months duration) \nExtension of the Terms of Reference for project supervising  $6,000 \nconsultants to include on-the-job training to counterpart \nengineers \nProcurement of books and equipment  $4,000 \n  Total  $35,000 \n ", "56  Appendix 11 \nd.  Residual Adverse Impacts \n \ni.  Land Take for Realignment Work and the Installation of \nRetaining and Revetment Structures \n \n81.  Assumptions include a total land take of 14,348 m2 and a monthly land rental charge of \n$80 per ha. Assuming that rental charges do not increase with inflation, a total cost of some \n$1,920  per  ha  over  a  period  of  two  years.  The  total  extent  of  land  take  anticipated  is \napproximately 1.4 ha and therefore a total value for this impact is $2,700. \n \nii.  Disruption to Traffic during Construction \n \n82.  Given the assumed number of sites and indicative quantities, the likely delay for each \nunit length of road can be estimated by assigning a range of construction periods and delay \ntimes for each type of site. Data on passenger demand and time value is available from the \nFeasibility Study carried out for the Transport Sector Restoration Project (footnote 9).  \n \n83.  From discussions with road engineers engaged on the EIRP as to construction periods \nand likely delays to vehicles associated with partial road closure during the works, the delays \nare anticipated for project works on each 50 km length of road are shown in Table A11.5. \n \nTable A11.5: Estimation of Construction-Induced Traffic Congestion \n \nType of Site  No. per  Construction Period  Delay per Journey  Total Delay during \n50 km  (days)  (mins)  Construction \nof road  Minimum  Maximum  Minimum  Maximum  Minimum   Maximum  \nSubstantial wall  2  36  48  3  6  3.6  9.6 \nMedium wall  8  14  21  3  6  5.6  16.8 \nRealignment  1  36  48  8  12  4.8  9.6 \n \n84.  Current passenger demand data is available for each road link in the feasibility study \n(footnote 8). The total delays for all vehicles are then estimated. Delay times are assumed apply \nto all passengers, regardless of the type of vehicle they are travelling in. \n \n85.  The  cost,  in  economic  terms,  of  passenger  delays  is  determined  using  a  figure  of \n$0.3334 per passenger per hour (footnote 9) and is based on: \n \n(i)  the valuation of a daily wage rate of $3 and an expansion factor (wages/value \nadded) of 1.25; \n(ii)  the assessment, by means of a passenger survey, of the proportions of trips \nmade for working and nonworking purposes; and \n(iii)  a weighting to reflect the ratio of working journeys to nonworking journeys.  \n \n86.

While considerable uncertainty exists as to the costs and extents of environmental \nimpacts envisaged from the EIRP-2, the comparison of costs and benefits suggests a net \nbenefit for the EIRP-2, and the costs of mitigation proposed in the IEE are outweighed by the \nbenefits envisaged. \n ", "Table A11.9: Checklist of Potential Environmental Impacts \n \nEnvironmental Impacts    Assessment of Potential Impacts   \nConsiderations        Number of  Significant Impacts   \nAffecting      Possible   Significant         \nEnvironmental  Adverse  Beneficial  Mitigation  Impact  Small  Moderate  Major  Justification \nResources and      Measures                   \nValues  A*  B  A  B  A  B  A  B \nA.

The Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (Phase 2) (EIRP-2) will follow the \nexisting Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (EIRP), being implemented under Grant \n8181-ETM.  It  will  address  key  concerns  for  establishing  an  effective  road  maintenance \ncapability in East Timor, by undertaking slope stabilization tasks on critical landslide hazard \nsites  within  the  road  network,  and  provide  support  for  the  establishment  of  a  routine \nmaintenance regime, focusing on community involvement. \n \n2.  The purpose of this report is to summarize the approach and findings of a social and \npoverty assessment of the EIRP-2, conducted during April 2001. The investigations consisted of \nkey informant interviews, questionnaire surveys of the principal beneficiary groups, and review \nof secondary information sources. In addition, semiformal meetings were held with beneficiary \ngroups to obtain opinions, views, and wishes of key stakeholders for use in project design.  \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n3.  The  EIRP-2  is  an  infrastructure  development  initiative  and  will  consist  of  slope \nstabilization works on critical landslide hazard sites within East Timor\u2019s road network, capacity \nbuilding in terms of technical assistance (TA) for the establishment of a community labor-based \nroutine maintenance regime, training of East Timorese counterparts, and project management. \nProject sites are located on selected priority road links throughout East Timor, comprising the \nroad lengths between Batugade and Zumalai in Bobonaro and Cova Lima districts in the west of \nthe country, Tibar to Ermera in Liquica and Ermera districts to the west of Dili, and Baucau to \nViqueque towns in Baucau and Viqueque districts toward the east of the country. The total road \nlength covered is 211.4 kilometers (km), and total EIRP-2 cost is estimated at $10 million. \n \n4.  The need for the EIRP-2 arises from both the key role of road access in extending \nservices and market access to the rural poor of East Timor, and the difficulties encountered in \nmaintaining roads at reasonable cost in the severe geological conditions prevalent on the island. \nThe population of East Timor is largely rural, and limitations on access to schools, hospitals and \nmarkets both exacerbate poor living conditions and limit opportunities for poverty eradication. \nThe reliability of road access is limited by the frequency of landslide occurrence, which is largely \ndue to the weak materials of which most slopes are composed, and high, concentrated rainfall \nrendering much of the primary road network highly vulnerable to failure. The expense and \ntechnical  difficulty  involved  in  repairing  and  preventing  landslides  threatens  to  deflect  vital \nresources from routine road repair and maintenance over primary and secondary roads, which \nis essential if vehicle operating costs, and hence accessibility of roads to use by poorer groups, \nare to decrease. The strategy adopted for the EIRP-2 is to address critical areas of instability \nwithin the network, to establish an efficient routine maintenance regime that itself contributes to \nthe reduction of rural poverty, along with capacity building to help the future roads authority \nacquire the necessary managerial and technical skills. \n \n5.  The establishment of a community-based routine road maintenance regime is of special \nrelevance to the social and poverty assessment, as a specific pro-poor aspect of the project \ndesign. \n ", "72  Appendix 12 \n \n1.  Location \n \n6.  The location of civil works is tentatively planned to be carried out on the following priority \nroad links located throughout East Timor: \n \nTable A12.1: Roads Selected for Earthworks \n \n    Length  Total Length \nRoad  Road Link  (km)  (km) \nBaucau to Viqueque  Baucau to Border Viqueque    44.8    64.2 \nBorder Viqueque to Viqueque    19.4 \nTibar to Ermera  Tibar to Border Ermera    18.5    40.4 \nBorder Ermera to Ermera    21.9 \nBatugade to Zumalai  Batugade to Maliana    45.1    106.8 \nMaliana to Hauba    34.8 \nHauba to Zumalai    26.9 \nSource: EIRP PMU. \n \n7.  Given  the  nature  of  occurrence  of  landslide  hazards,  a  degree  of  flexibility  in  site \nallocation is required.  \n \n2.  Size and Scope of Project Operations \n \n8.  The EIRP-2 consists of the following components: \n \n(i)  Preventative civil works and periodic maintenance. The scope of works will \nencompass  fully  engineered  slope  stabilization  works  incorporating \nbioengineering  techniques  and  minor  realignment,  with  associated  capacity \nbuilding in prioritizing, planning, and executing the works to a high standard. The \ncost of this component is estimated at $8,700,000, approximately 87 percent of \nthe total project budget. \n \n(ii)  Support for the establishment of a routine maintenance regime. The EIRP-2 \nwill include TA tasks for establishing the field organization and building capacity \nfor a routine maintenance program whereby village groups are made responsible \nfor  critical  routine  maintenance  tasks,  and  rewarded  and  supervised \nappropriately for this. \n \n(iii)  Training and project management. This will cover the upgrading of necessary \nskills  for  the  future  roads  authority  to  assume  the  managerial  and  technical \nresponsibility  for  implementing  routine  and  periodic  maintenance,  acquire \nspecialist expertise in bio- and other engineering techniques, and financial and \nadministrative accountability. The work will include an assessment of immediate, \nand  medium-  and  long-term  training  requirements,  under  a  comprehensive \nhuman resource development assessment. The management of the EIRP-2 will \nbe effected through a project management unit (PMU), as set up for the EIRP.  \n ", "Appendix 12  73\n \nC.  Country Background \n \n1.  Social Issues \n \n9.  East Timor is currently in a postconflict situation, following the events associated with a \nreferendum held in late 1999, in which the people of East Timor voted overwhelmingly in favor \nof independence from Indonesia. The referendum prompted widespread and severe violence \nthat resulted in many deaths, the destruction of public infrastructure and private property, and \nthe  loss  of  many  skilled  and  professional  people.  However,  the  referendum  succeeded  in \nremoving the former administration, which had become intensely unpopular with the majority of \nEast Timorese.  \n \n10.  The current transition period and forthcoming elections offer both opportunities and \nchallenges. The new leaders who are to be elected in 2001 have the opportunity to benefit from \nthe lessons learned by other Asian and Pacific countries who have experienced significant \nstructural changes in government in recent decades. In addition, the lessons learned from \nvarying approaches to social and economic development in developing countries can also be \nbrought into consideration as the new government forms strategies for the development of the \nnew nation. At the same time, most East Timorese have high expectations from the new \ngovernment, while real improvements for the majority of East Timorese will take time to achieve. \nIn addition, the country\u2019s new leaders will be elected from a group that has been denied the \nbenefit of experience in governance during the former regime. \n \n2.  Poverty Issues \n \n11.  Poverty in East Timor is, at present, very widespread, particularly in rural areas. While \nmany of the rural poor are able to avoid severe food shortages, daily expenses such as \ntransportation and essential goods are high, and opportunities for income generation limited. \nAccording to available data,1 some 75 percent of the population are poor; their average income \nis some 7 percent below the poverty line. Measures of inequality currently suggest limited \ndisparity between the relatively well off and the poor. \n \n12.  Poverty has always been widespread in East Timor, but has been exacerbated both by \nthe events of late 1999, and by a preceding period of deepening neglect of social and other \ninfrastructure by the previous government.  \n \n13.  Though security was restored by mid 2000 and some public services set up by the East \nTimor Transitional Administration (ETTA), the effects of the violence and destruction, which \nincluded the removal of access to Indonesian domestic markets, combined with the period of \nneglect by the previous government, led to a considerably worsened poverty situation.  \n \n14.  In comparison with the situation prior to the referendum, the rural poor of East Timor \nsuffer from higher costs of transportation and essential goods such as clothing and fuel. Many \nare living in damaged houses, or in crowded conditions as a result of the destruction of private \nhomes. While the ETTA has reestablished many schools and set up health services, both of \nthese services are relatively understaffed. Health conditions appear to be deteriorating, with a \n                                                 \n1  The most up to date information source at present is the survey carried out under the ADB funded East Timor \nRapid Assessment of Economic and Social Conditions report of June 2000. This is expected to be updated by \nJune 2001, following completion and analysis of a more substantial survey. \n ", "74  Appendix 12 \nhigh incidence of malaria and lower respiratory tract infections, in particular. School curricula are \ngenerally limited to language training. Of primary significance is the lack of income generating \nopportunities for the poor. While East Timorese have been largely able to avoid starvation, by \nfinding alternative food sources as well as benefits from food distribution by relief agencies, \neconomic  activity,  particularly  at  the  village  level,  remains  extremely  limited.  Most  rural \nhouseholds have little or no access to cash-earning employment. Meagre surpluses of fruits and \nvegetables are often exchanged for other produce in local markets, rather than for cash. The \nremoval  of  trade  with  neighboring  Indonesian  provinces  has  meant  that  many  of  the \ncommodities  that  were  previously  sold  in  Dili  no  longer  fetch  prices  that  suffice  to  cover \ntransport costs. Beyond coffee and some handicrafts, few commodities can easily be sold \ninternationally, and opportunities for producing these are relatively localized. With little access to \ncash-generating opportunities, access to credit is minimal and hence the means to establish \nsmall businesses or seek employment further afield. \n \n15.  Reduced export opportunities and increasing migration to the towns from the countryside \nhas resulted in growing urban poverty, particularly in Dili. The urban poor share with their rural \nneighbors the situation of worsening health, limited education, and limited opportunities. \n \n16.  Potential  for  economic  growth  exists  through  agricultural  crop  development,  the \nsustainable exploitation of assets such as oil and gas reserves, and tourism. As improved \ngovernance  evolves  in  East  Timor  and  strategies  for  economic  growth  are  identified  and \nimplemented,  the  distribution  of  wealth  will  remain  a  challenge.  A  significant  means  of \nempowering groups such as the rural poor to take part in growing economic activity is the \nencouragement of activities that involve sustainable cash incomes to the poorest members of \nTimorese society, which empowers people with the ability to establish small businesses, search \nfor work opportunities, and have improved access to the media. \n \n3.  Community Involvement in the Road Sector \n \n17.  Roadside communities in East Timor have been involved in road maintenance in the \npast. Some lighter work, such as the clearance of vegetation from road drains and verges, was \noften undertaken on an unpaid basis, and organized by the Chefs de Sucos. In addition, a \nnumber of villagers were employed by the former Department of Infrastructure, or occasionally \nby contractors, in road maintenance tasks. A number of villagers have relevant skills such as \nplant operators, mechanics, masons, and site supervisors. \n \nD.  Project Stakeholders \n \n18.  As a road project, the EIRP-2 will benefit all road users, and groups reliant on the regular \npassage  of  goods  and  people  for  their  livelihoods  and  quality  of  life.  The  generation  of \nemployment on a sustained basis, particularly in rural areas traversed by the roads, provides \nvaluable opportunities for poor rural communities. In addition, the establishment of a cost-\neffective road maintenance regime, together with capacity-building functions, will enhance the \ngovernance of the sector. Stakeholders are listed in Table A12.2. \n ", "Appendix 12  75\nTable A12.2: Project Stakeholders \n \nStakeholders  Means of Benefiting \nUrban communities served by  Improved access to markets and essential services during the \n  the road  operation phase \nRural communities living near  Improved access to markets and essential services during the \n  the roads  operation phase \nEmployment in construction works \nSustainable employment in the community maintenance regime to \nbe established for the project works \nSupport of existing village structures, by engaging communities to \nundertake work on contract, under the direction of their local \nrepresentatives \nCommercial transport service  Improved reliability of road access \n  providers (passengers and  Reduced vehicle operating costs \n  freight) \nRoad authority  Reduction of burden on resources posed by the major landslide \nhazard sites, and capacity building from other project components  \nDevelopment of an eclectically designed and cost-effective \nmethodology for community-based routine maintenance \nSource: Staff analysis. \n \n19.

Communities Served by the Roads \n \n20.  Potentially,  the  entire  road  network  in  East  Timor  is  set  to  benefit  from  the  road \nmaintenance support that the EIRP-2 is designed to provide. However, project activities will be \nfocused on the Baucau to Viqueque, Tibar to Ermera, and Batugade to Zumalai roads. The \ngroup is therefore taken to consist of all residents of towns directly served by these roads, and \nof villages situated along the road lengths.

Questionnaire surveys were carried out at sample households on the Baucau\u2013Viqueque \nand Batugade\u2013Zumalai roads to determine the socioeconomic profile of this group, and to \ngather information on needs and wishes, opinions, and willingness to pay for public services.  \n \na.  Socioeconomic Profile of Rural Communities \n \n22.  Parameters describing the socioeconomic profile of villagers living along the alignments \nof  the  Baucau\u2013Viqueque  and  Batugade\u2013Zumalai  roads  were  determined  by  means  of  a \nquestionnaire survey (Table A12.8, p. 85).  \n \n23.  The communities, in the case of both roads, are generally poor, have little access to paid \nemployment,  are  poorly  educated,  and  often  live  in  inadequate  housing.  Relatively  few \nrespondents  (49  percent)  were  able  or  willing  to  provide  data  on  incomes.  On  careful \nquestioning by the survey team, the main reason for this appeared to be a lack of education, \nand hence familiarity in considering financial issues on other than a day-to-day basis. The \nincome data that was provided, is therefore most likely to be a reflection of the better-off \nhouseholds.  \n \n24.  The average income for households in the survey area is around Rp623,800 (Rp976,000 \nfor  Baucau\u2013Viqueque  and  Rp330,300  for  Batugade\u2013Zumalai).  However,  most  income  is \ndependant on travel to nearby towns or to Dili for sale of goods or employment. Households \nspend on average some Rp57,700 per month on transport (37,000 for Baucau\u2013Viqueque and \nRp66,000 for Batugade\u2013Zumalai).  \n \n25.  The survey found that between 50 and 60 percent of these households are poor. Two \nalternative poverty lines were used: one based on monthly income, and one based on per capita \nexpenditure  on  food.  These  are  quoted  in  the  initial  poverty  assessment  for  East  Timor, \n ", "Appendix 12  77\nproduced in September 2000. To compare these with October 2000 prices, a factor of 1.24 was \napplied to the poverty line values in each case, to reflect inflation.2 \n \nTable A12.5: Comparison of Poverty Line Values \n \n  Monthly Income: Rp124,000 per  Expenditure on food: \n  laborer per month (assumes one  Rp86,800 per person per \nPoverty Line  laborer per household)  month \nBaucau\u2013Viqueque     \nPoor Households (number)  16  19 \nPoor Respondents (%)  64  54 \nBatugade\u2013Zumalai     \nPoor Households (number)  17  22 \nPoor Respondents (%)  57   52  \nEntire Sample     \nPoor Households (number)  33  41 \nPercent Poor  60 percent  53 percent \nRp1.00=$0.000124. \nSource: As travel to nearby towns or to Dili is necessary to realize most sources of income, the report costs of \nmonthly travel were deducted from reported incomes before comparison with the poverty line. \n \nb.  Needs and Demands of Rural Communities \n \n26.  Villagers were asked about road usage, needs for improved road access, and general \ndevelopmental priorities.  \n \n27.  The most common problem associated with road usage is landslides: 62 percent of all \nrespondents cited landslides as a problem, and 33 percent cited washouts as a problem. In \naddition, 33 percent of respondents identified inadequate road width as a problem, and 29 \npercent cited road roughness as a problem. \n \n28.  Nearly all villagers use the road frequently to travel to the nearest district town, to Dili, \nand to other destinations. Seventy-five percent of all journeys are taken by bus, the balance by \nprivate vehicles, on foot, or occasionally on horseback. The most common reported purpose of \ntravel is to visit friends and family, particularly on trips to Dili (63 percent of all journeys to Dili). \nTwenty-five percent of journeys are to district towns and 14 percent of journeys to Dili are for \nselling produce. \n \n29.  Rising transport fares are clearly a major concern of villagers living along the project \nroads. Eighty percent of respondents said that fares are unduly expensive, usually adding that \nfares are more expensive than under the previous government.  \n \n30.  When asked for the most important requirement for an improved standard of living, the \nmost common response was that sources of cash income are needed (29 percent), 22 percent \ncited house repairs as the most important requirement, and 25 percent cited electricity as the \nmost important. Other requirements were clean water, improved health, improved education, \nand improved transportation (11 percent). When asked which change would have the most \nsignificant  benefit  to  the  well-being  of  the  household,  again  the  most  common  response \nconcerned cash earning opportunities (44 percent).  \n                                                 \n2  Exchange rate information given on the website www.exchangerate.com, which provides data from October 2000, \ngave the value of the Indoniesian rupiah as Rp8,886 to the $1.00 in October 2000. The present figure is Rp11,030. \nThis implies an inflation rate of 24 percent over the period. \n ", "78  Appendix 12 \nc.  Rural Communities\u2019 Willingness to Pay for Improved Road Services \n \n31.  Villagers were asked if they were willing to pay for the use of roads if they own, or plan \nto own a car or motorcycle. In fact, only one respondent owned a vehicle. Fifty (85 percent) of \nthe fifty-nine respondents said they would be willing to pay for road use despite not owning a \nvehicle; 9 of these (15 percent) said they were not. On average, respondents were prepared to \npay around Rp3,500 for road use per journey. \n \nd.  Opinions of Rural Communities \n \n32.  The  opinions  of  villagers  were  sought  in  the  questionnaires  as  to  the  standard  of \ngovernance  of  the  road  sector  prior  to  1999,  and  in  village  meetings  for  the  appropriate \narrangements for community-based road maintenance.  \n \n33.  Respondents were asked to state their opinions regarding the construction of new roads, \nstandard of maintenance, ability to treat potholes and small problems with roads, ability to re-\nopen roads after landslides, employment of local people and public information. For each of \nthese aspects of road sector management, the balance of respondents were satisfied with the \nperformance of the previous road authority. Respondents were most satisfied (77 percent) with \nthe extent of new road construction, and least satisfied (61 percent) with the standard of \nprovision of information concerning roads to the public.  \n \n34.  Eighty-six percent of all respondents are prepared to be involved in community-based \nroad  work.  Seventy  percent  stated  that  they  should  be  paid  for  this  work.  During  village \nmeetings, villagers explained that some road maintenance work, primarily the clearance of \nvegetation, was organized by community leaders (chefs de sucos) and carried out voluntarily. \nVillagers were also engaged to undertake drain clearance and other heavier tasks, either by \ncontractors or directly by the former Department of Infrastructure. When asked what a fair rate \nof pay would be for this work, the average daily wage quoted was Rp40,260 (Rp38,500 for \nBaucau\u2013Viqueque and Rp41,250 for Batugade\u2013Zumalai).  \n \n35.  Nearly all villagers felt that community-based road maintenance should be organized by \nthe community leaders, usually the chefs de sucos. These individuals are considered capable of \norganizing  labor,  collecting  and  distributing  pay,  appointing  site  supervisors,  and  resolving \nconflicts. In some cases the engagement of small-scale contractors from among the general \nvillage  population  was  recommended,  but  these  contractors  should  be  local.  Even  where \nvillagers suggest that small-scale contractors be used, the chef de suco is identified as the main \nauthority for conflict resolution. Villagers feel they should be provided with hand tools, and that \nthey can take responsibility for them, although ultimate responsibility for looking after tools \nprovided by the road authority would rest with the chef de suco.  \n \n36.  Most communities stressed that they do not wish work in their neighborhood to be \nundertaken by people from outside their own community.  \n \n3.  Local Contractors \n \n37.  Small-scale local contractors stand to benefit from construction and maintenance work \nassociated with both the civil works and maintenance system establishment components of the \nEIRP-2. On discussion with communities, community work was found to often be organized by \nthe  chef  de  suco,  although  in  some  places,  such  as  Maliana  (Bobonaro  District),  other \nindividuals within the community are known to work as contractors. In each case however, \n ", "Appendix 12  79\nvillagers envisaged a key role for the chef de suco or other elected representative in the \nexecution of small-scale contracts. The needs, demands, and opinions of village groups are \ntherefore taken to cover the point of view of local contractors. \n \n4.  Commercial Transport Service Providers \n \n38.  Bus and minivan operators, as well as freight vehicle operators, stand to benefit both \nfrom the increased reliability of the road that is expected to result from the EIRP-2, and from the \narrest  of  deterioration  of  road  surfaces.  Information  on  needs,  demands,  and  opinions  of \ntransport service providers was canvassed through a questionnaire survey of vehicle operators. \n \na.  Needs, Demands and Opinions of Vehicle Operators \n \n39.  The most common problem with the road network cited by vehicle operators was the \noccurrence of blockages, resulting from landslides. Eighty-nine percent of respondents identified \nthis problem. Concern was also expressed over the roughness and the width of the roads, \nalthough no respondents appeared to feel that road safety was a problem. When asked about \nrequirements for the improvement of the road network, most respondents felt that roads should \nbe smoother, or clear of potholes (70 percent felt this improvement is important), 65 percent felt \nthat roads should be wider, and 54 percent felt that the incidence of landslides should be \nreduced.  \n \n40.  The main concerns of vehicle operators concerned the effect of delays on their business. \nOthers said that they were concerned about a growth in traffic volume. Many operators felt that \nthe incidence of potholes and of landslides is increasing. \n \nb.  Vehicle Operators\u2019 Willingness to Pay for Road Use \n \n41.  Ninety-five percent of vehicle operators stated that they were prepared to pay for road \nuse, the remaining 5 percent stated that they were not. Of those that were prepared to pay, \nsome preferred to pay on the basis of a road toll for each journey undertaken (23 percent of all \nrespondents), others preferred to pay periodically (57 percent of all respondents). \n \n42.  The  road  toll  that  vehicle  operators  were  willing  to  pay  was  between  Rp750  and \nRp50,000 per journey undertaken, the average toll was Rp20,000. \n \n43.  The monthly charge that vehicle operators were willing to pay also ranged between \nRp750 and Rp50,000 per month, the average charge being Rp12,900. \n \n5.  Community Works \n \n44.  At present, roads in East Timor are managed by the Ministry of Water and Public Works \n(MWPW). The future roads administration stands to benefit from the EIRP-2 in terms of reduced \nload on the road maintenance budget, and capacity building. Following the village meetings and \nsurvey, a workshop was held with MWPW Road Services to present the findings of the survey \nand meetings, and to discuss options for establishing community-based road maintenance.  \n \n45.  The MWPW Road Services personnel feel that community-based road maintenance \nwork should be organized by means of contracts. The contracts may be signed with village \nrepresentatives such as the chef de suco. The scope of the contracts should be limited to \ntechnically simple routine work, such as the clearance of vegetation and digging out of drains.  \n ", "80  Appendix 12 \n \n46.  The chef de suco is traditionally responsible for organizing community work; this is \nconsidered responsibility to the community, rather than financial reward, as in the case of a \ncontract. The wisdom of engaging chefs de suco as contractors that receive financial reward for \norganizing labor was discussed, as in the long term the element of financial reward could affect \nthe nature of the chef de suco position. In reality, many sucos have only limited lengths of \nnational road within their boundaries. Workshop participants felt that this aspect should be \ncarefully monitored.  \n \nE.  Poverty Impact Assessment \n \n47.  The EIRP-2 will impact on the lives of poor people in the target areas and in the nation \nas a whole, through the following: \n \n(i)  improved access to markets and essential services from increased reliability of \nroad transport, \n(ii)  direct employment of poor people in construction work, \n(iii)  direct and sustained employment of people in routine maintenance work, and  \n(iv)  payment of wages to laborers from communities that are currently largely outside \nthe cash economy, and hence less able to establish small businesses and trades \nand rise out of poverty. \n \n1.  Poverty Impact Matrix \n \n48.  Table A12.6 shows the effects of employment on the lives of poor people. \n \nTable A12.6: Poverty Impact Matrix \n \n        Loan   \nPrincipal Beneficiaries  Benefit Type/  Number  Poverty  Allocation   Level of \nMechanism  Estimate  Status  ($ million)  Impact \nComponent A: Civil Works  8.7   \nUnskilled and Semiskilled Laborers  Paid Employment    59,400  B    A \nRoad Users  Improved Access   188,100  B    B \nComponent B: Establishment of Routine Road Maintenance Regime  1.0   \nUnskilled and Semiskilled Laborers  Paid Employment    59,400  B    A \nRoad Users  Improved Access   188,100  B    B \nComponent C: Project Management and Capacity Building  0.3   \n           \nTotal Poor Beneficiaries    141,000         \nProject Investment Cost    10,000,000         \n% Investment Targeted to poor    100         \n% population BPL    75         \n% project beneficiaries BPL    60         \n% beneficiaries BPL : % National BPL      B     \nLoan Amount Targeted to the Poor        A   \nOverall Impact Rating          B \nBPL= below poverty line.  \nSource: ADB. \n ", "Appendix 12  81\n \n2.  Assumptions \n \na.  Poverty Status \n \n49.  Poverty status is assessed by comparing the percentage of people living below the \npoverty line estimated from the results of the questionnaire survey against the national figure of \n75 percent, quoted in the initial poverty assessment for East Timor, September 2000.  \n \nb.  Estimated Number of Beneficiaries \n \n50.  These estimates are made according to 1998 census data, which gives populations for \neach suco in the country. Where this data has been updated since the 1999 conflict, it has been \ndone on a district basis and is therefore not comparable.  Estimates have been made by \nobtaining, with the help of the Government staff in each district, the sucos that are situated \nalong the road alignment and within the district town. The number of people that will benefit from \nimproved road access is taken to be the total number of people in sucos situated along the road \nalignment and within the towns. The number of people that will benefit from paid employment is \ntaken to be the total number of people in sucos situatated along the road alignment only. \n \nc.  Assessment of Impact of Paid Employment \n \n51.  The impact of paid employment, either for civil works during the EIRP-2, or for routine \nwork during the maintenance period, has been estimated by adding predicted payments to \ncurrent household incomes. A daily rate of pay of Rp20,000 is assumed, and the effect of \nemploying one household member of one, two, and three days per month is assessed.  \n \n52.  Within the sample, the total number of people living below the poverty lines is reduced \nconsiderably when cash incomes are applied. Table A12.7 shows the effect of payment of \nvarying monthly sums to households: \n \nTable A12.7: Effect of Incomes to Households \n \nEmployment for     \nRoadwork  Additional Income  Households Poverty Line\n(number of days)  (Rp)  (%) \n0    0    60  \n2    40,000    44  \n4    80,000    31  \n6    120,000    20  \n8    60,000    9 \nSource: Staff estimates. \n \n53.  As a result of the EIRP-2, a high proportion of beneficiaries will receive incomes that \nraise and sustain them above the poverty line. In the case of the establishment of a routine \nmaintenance  regime,  the  effect  is  expected  to  be  fully  sustainable.  The  effect  of  paid \nemployment is therefore rated as A. \n ", "82  Appendix 12 \nd.  Assessment of Impact of Improved Road Access \n \n54.  Poor households will benefit from improved road access indirectly, through reduced \ncosts of access to markets and reduced journey times. These effects are expected to play a part \nin raising incomes on a sustainable basis, and importantly to raise incomes over the poverty \nline.  \n \ne.  Loan Amount Targeted to the Poor \n \n55.  The EIRP is considered a poverty intervention as its primary purpose is to enable the \nfuture government to maintain the road network in order to allow rural poor people to engage in \neconomic activity and to enable provision of essential services.  \n \nF.  Project Design Options \n \n1.  Options for Increasing Poverty Impact \n \n56.  The  poverty  impact  assessment  identifies  that  the  shortage  of  income-earning \nopportunities is a major concern among villagers in the project area. The shortage of cash in \nvillage economies further reduces the ability of villagers to establish small businesses and \nacquire skills to bring them out of poverty.  \n \n57.  The  establishment  of  a  community-based  road  maintenance  regime  provides  a \nmechanism for providing cash to rural poor communities, as well as the means to raise the \nincomes of beneficiaries above the poverty line. \n \n2.  Gender \n \n58.  Responses by beneficiaries in the project area have shown that physical work and the \ncontrol of funds are generally undertaken by men. These views were corroborated during village \nmeetings with groups of beneficiaries, although in most cases villagers said that women were \nregularly involved in tasks such as vegetation clearance. The fact that women are likely to have \na relatively small share of employment and the allocation of the proceeds of employment is \nsignificant.  \n \n59.  Three  percent  of  households  interviewed  were  headed  by  women.  The  possible \nexclusion of such households from access to paid work on road maintenance is an issue of \nconcern.  \n \n60.  To ensure that women are not denied the benefits of access to paid employment, it is \nrecommended that the issue be discussed with village representatives when forming contracts \nfor labor, and the representatives should agree to ensure that women are fully entitled to \nemployment. The situation should be monitored when community labor contracts are being \nimplemented. A sample of women within the community should be interviewed prior to the \nrenewal of contracts. \n \n3.  Participation \n \n61.  The establishment of a community-based road maintenance regime, which is a major \ncomponent of the EIRP-2, is participatory in nature. The views of communities have been \nobtained  in  developing  the  project  concept,  through  small-scale  meetings  held  at  sample \n ", "Appendix 12  83\nvillages along the alignment of both roads. The majority view is that community-based labor \nshould be organized by means of contracts, arranged through elected village representatives.  \n \n4.  Governance \n \n62.  East  Timor  is  in  the  process  of  forming  an  indigenous  government.  This  situation \nprovides the opportunity to introduce concepts that have evolved from lessons learned through \ndevelopment endeavors elsewhere in Asia. The EIRP-2, as a strategically designed sustainable \nmaintenance initiative, will put forward a strategy for management of the road sector that \nembodies the principles of equitability and justice.  \n \n5.  Affordability \n \n63.  The use of project funds to address critical landslide hazard areas and reduce their \nimpact on future road maintenance funds is an initiative designed specifically for the issue of \naffordability, as is the establishment of a community-based road maintenance regime.  \n \n64.  With regard to continued sustainability of the road maintenance system that will be \nestablished, the rate of pay to villagers is a critical issue.  \n \n6.  Labor \n \n65.  The  EIRP-2  makes  use  of  labor  intensive  construction  and  road  maintenance \ntechniques. \n \n7.  Other Risks/Vulnerabilities \n \n66.  East Timor is in a postconflict situation, and has emerged from a recent period in which \nintense violence was commonplace. With the withdrawal of the United Nations Transitional \nAdministration in East Timor and peacekeeping forces following the formation of a new elected \ngovernment, a period will ensue in which poverty levels will remain high, expectations on the \nperformance of the new government will be high, and difficulties likely as the new nation is \nformed. Localized conflict and violence, and periods of political unrest are possible. \n \n67.  A further risk concerns the difference in capability among neighboring communities. \nInevitably some communities are better organized and more capable of undertaking road work \nthan others. At the same time, the village meetings and existing experience show that most rural \ncommunities in East Timor do not allow people from outside the community to undertake work in \ntheir village areas. This will lead to difficulties in the case of communities that do not perform, as \ncommunities that do not carry out road maintenance work satisfactorily are likely to resist the \nengagement of workers from outside the community to complete the work. Strong skill and \njudgment by road authorities is required to overcome this risk. \n \nG.  Conclusion \n \n68.  Positive  and  significant  impacts  of  the  EIRP-2  are  anticipated  for  the  beneficiary \ncommunities.  The  civil  works  component  will  enhance  the  reliability  of  road  access  for \ncommunities  around  the  country,  including  poorer  and  more  vulnerable  communities.  The \nestablishment of a community-based road maintenance regime will provide a cost-effective \nmeans of ensuring that roads are maintained, and a mechanism for providing sustainable \nincomes to rural communities that have a strong need for income-generating opportunities.  \n ", "84  Appendix 12 \n \n69.  Rural communities in East Timor have a strong structure of local representation, and \nvillage  representatives  are  capable  of  organizing  collective  activity,  such  as  the  road \nmaintenance activity that is proposed. The initiative is therefore appropriate to local social \nconditions and structures. \n \nTable A12.8: Socioeconomic Data Obtained from Questionnaire Survey \n \n  Combined for Entire \nBaucau-Viqueque  Batugade-Zumalai \nParameter  Sample \nValue  Percentage  Value  Percentage  Value  Percentage \nNumber of Households    53    \u2013    59    \u2013    112    \u2013 \ninterviewed \nAverage age of respondents    30    \u2013    42    \u2013    40    \u2013 \nAverage Household Size    6.8    \u2013    6.6    \u2013    6.7    \u2013 \nHouse ownership    51.0    96    55    93    106    95 \nHouse Types \n\u2022  Medium or high cost    7    13    6    10    13    12 \n\u2022  Low cost    17    32    27    46    44    39 \n\u2022  Makeshift    5    9    12    20    17    15 \n\u2022  Bush materials    23    43    14    24    37    33 \n\u2022  Permanent roof (such as    27    51    40    68    67    60 \ncorrugated iron) \n\u2022  Temporary roof (bush    24    45    16    27    40    36 \nmaterials, or tarpaulin) \nIncome Data \nNumber of respondents    25    47    30    51    55    49 \nproviding income data \nPaid employment \n\u2022  Number of households    5    9    6    10    11    10 \nbenefiting from paid \nemployment \n\u2022  Average monthly salaries  2,826,000    \u2013    360,000    \u2013  1,479,394    \u2013 \nFamily donations \n\u2022  Number of households    1    2    0    0    1    1 \nbenefiting from donations \nSales of livestock and/or garden surpluses \n\u2022  Number of households    13    25    25    42    38    34 \nselling surplus food \n\u2022  Average incomes from   312,600    \u2013   212,600    \u2013   246,800    \u2013 \nsales of surpluses \nSmall Businesses (kiosks, tailors, services) \n\u2022  Number of households    9    17    3    5    12    11 \nengaged in small business \n\u2022  Average incomes from   680,500    \u2013   816,700    \u2013   714,500    \u2013 \nsmall businesses \nAverage incomes from all   976,000    \u2013   330,000    \u2013   623,000    \u2013 \nsources \nAverage expenditure on    37,000    \u2013    66,000    \u2013    57,700    \u2013 \ntransport \nAverage net income   943,300    \u2013   271,300    \u2013   576,800    \u2013 \nNumber of households that    16    64    17    57    33    60 \nprovided income data that are \npoor, based on income \ncriteriaa \nReported weekly expenditure   130,200    \u2013   125,900    \u2013   127,800    \u2013 \non food per household \nReported weekly expenditure    22,800    \u2013    21,250    \u2013    22,000    \u2013 \non food per person \n ", "Appendix 12  85\n  Combined for Entire \nBaucau-Viqueque  Batugade-Zumalai \nParameter  Sample \nValue  Percentage  Value  Percentage  Value  Percentage \nNumber of households that    19    54    22    52    41    53 \nare poor, based on \nconsumption criteriab \nAverage reported monthly    48,900    \u2013    65,250    \u2013    58,300    \u2013 \nexpenditure on clothing \nRange spent on clothing per  12,500 \u2013    \u2013  150,000 \u2013    \u2013    \u2013    \u2013 \nhousehold per month    50,000   300,000 \nAverage reported monthly  51,300    \u2013    65,400    \u2013    59,600    \u2013 \nexpenditure on fuel \nRange of sums spent on fuel    7,000 \u2013    \u2013    5,000 \u2013    \u2013    \u2013    \u2013 \nper month   120,000   300,000 \nAverage reported annual   129,000    \u2013    81,000    \u2013   109,400    \u2013 \nexpenditure on schooling \nRange spent on schooling    4,000 \u2013   \u2013  10,000 \u2013    \u2013    \u2013    \u2013 \nper annually  1,300,000   780,000 \nReported annual expenditure  1,200,000    \u2013  1,150,000    \u2013  1,166,000    \u2013 \non donations to family or \nchurch \nRange spent on donations    5,000 \u2013    \u2013    5,000 \u2013    \u2013    \u2013    \u2013 \nannually  7,000,000  4,000,000 \na \nThe poverty line adopted in this case is the figure of Rp 100,000 per month, quoted in the Initial Poverty \nAssessment in October 2000.
