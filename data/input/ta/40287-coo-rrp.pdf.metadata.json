An initial environmental examination was undertaken.  \nAssessment \n   \nProject Description  The Project will rehabilitate and expand the capacity of Avatiu port. The \nProject  comprises  (i)  widening  the  harbor  entrance,  (ii)  dredging  to \nincrease the depth alongside the wharf plus dredging and enlarging the \nship turning area, and (iii) reconstructing and realigning the quay and \nrepairing the adjacent wharf deck. \n   \nRationale  In 2007, the Government adopted the Preventive Infrastructure Master \nPlan (IMP), an integral part of the National Sustainable Development \nPlan  2007\u20132010.  The  IMP  concluded  that  lack  of  investment  in \nmaintenance, rehabilitation, and upgrading of basic infrastructure has \nresulted in aging systems that do not provide appropriate levels of \nservice to meet current demand and support sustained growth. \n \nAvatiu is the principal international port for the Cook Islands, as well as \nthe transshipment port for cargo to the second most populated island of \nAitutaki and the less populated outer islands. The country is heavily \nreliant on international imports by sea to support its tourism industry\u2014\nthe mainstay of the country\u2019s economy\u2014as well as for general imports \nand  exports.  Continued  efficient  operation  of  the  port,  its  security \nagainst periodic cyclone events, and its development to accommodate \nchanges in regional shipping methods are therefore critical to the Cook \nIslands\u2019 economy and the social well-being of its population. \n \nThe wharf is weak, aging, and vulnerable to damage from storms and \nimpact from vessels. The port is at the margin of safe operations for \ninternational  cargo  vessels  currently  serving  the  Cook  Islands. \nMeanwhile, longer, deeper-draft, and more efficient cargo vessels are \nplanned for the Pacific Islands trade in the next few years. The existing \nvessels  will  be  removed  from  service.  The  larger  ships  cannot  be \nhandled through Avatiu at present, due to limited depth alongside the \nwharf and in the harbor, berthing length limitations, and inadequate \nturning area within the harbor. The length limitation also prevents larger \ncruise  vessels  from  berthing  at  Avatiu,  thus  limiting  the  economic \nbenefit to be gained from this part of the tourism market. Without the \nProject, there will be escalating costs for periodic repair of the wharf \nand the port\u2019s use will need to be restricted to only smaller vessels. \nCosts will be higher, and there will be adverse economic impacts. ", "ii   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact will be continued economic growth and improved well-being \nof the population (the disadvantaged in particular). \nThe  outcome  will  be  a  secure  and  efficient  port  infrastructure  in \nRarotonga with constraints and safety risks removed. \n   \nProject Investment  The  Project\u2019s  cost  is  estimated  at  $18.2  million  (NZ$27.2  million), \nPlan   including taxes and duties of $2.2 million (NZ$3.3 million).  \n   \nFinancing Plan  ADB will provide a blended loan of $15.5 million equivalent, comprising \n$8.6 million from ordinary capital resources (OCR) and $6.9 million \nfrom the Asian Development Fund (ADF) to finance 85.2% of the total \ncost  including  taxes  and  duties.  The  Government  will  provide  $2.7 \nmillion, or 14.8% of the total cost.  \nADB\u2019s $6.9 million loan from ADF will have a 32-year term with a grace \nperiod of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% during the grace period and \n1.5% during the balance of the loan term, equal amortization, and such \nother terms and conditions as set forth in the draft ADF loan and project \nagreements.  \nADB\u2019s $8.6 million loan from OCR will be provided under its lending \nfacility based on the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR). The loan \nwill have a 25-year term including a grace period of 5 years, an interest \nrate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other \nterms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project \nagreements. \n   \nAllocation and  The  Government  will  onlend  the  loans  through  subsidiary  loan \nRelending Terms  agreements  to  the  Cook  Islands  Ports  Authority  on  terms  and \nconditions acceptable to ADB. The currency risk of the loans will be \nborne by the Government. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2012 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 April 2012 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  The Cook Islands Ports Authority (CIPA) \n   \nImplementation  The chief executive officer of CIPA will be the project director. CIPA will \nArrangements  recruit qualified and experienced staff for detailed design, construction \nsupervision, and financial administration of the Project and for ongoing \nmanagement  of  the  port  assets.  The  Board  of  the  Cook  Islands \nInvestment Corporation (CIIC) will be the steering committee for the \nProject.  \n   \nProcurement  Procurement of civil and marine works will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The works, involving \ndredging and reconstruction of the quay on a new alignment, will be in \na  one-contract  package  to  be  awarded  through  one-stage,  one-\nenvelope  international  competitive  bidding  with  prequalification.  The ", "  iii\nGovernment has asked ADB to approve advance action, conforming to \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  for  recruiting \nconsultants, prequalification, inviting bids, bidding, bid evaluation, and \nlimited contract award. \n   \nConsulting Services  International and national consulting services will be required to support \nCIPA  in  port  engineering  and  contract  management,  financial \nmanagement, construction supervision, and environmental monitoring. \nConsultants will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants. A total 92 person-months of consulting services \n(35 person-months international and 57 person-months national) have \nbeen budgeted for these purposes. An international consulting firm will \nbe recruited through quality- and cost-based selection for design and \ncost  review,  detailed  design,  construction  contract  supervision,  and \nenvironmental monitoring.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The net present value at a 12% discount rate is $3.7 million, and the \nBeneficiaries  economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 15.9%. Sensitivity analysis \nshows the Project to remain economically viable, with an EIRR of 12%, \nfor an increase in construction cost of 20% or a reduction in benefits of \n20%. The beneficiaries of the proposed Project are the end consumers \nof food, fuel, materials, and other goods in the Cook Islands who will \navoid the impact of steeply rising costs associated with the without-\nproject scenario. The poor and socially excluded will benefit from these \nlower  costs,  as  will  all  consumers,  but  the  poor\u2019s  benefit  as  a \npercentage of household income will be higher compared to most Cook \nIslanders. The increase in trade and new port users, such as larger \ncruise ships, will produce secondary benefits by boosting retail trade \nand tourism, thereby creating jobs among the local population.  \n   \nRisks and  The Cook Islands are subject to extreme weather events, such as the \nAssumptions  cyclones  of  2005.  There  is  a  risk  of  damage  to  the  port  works  in \nprogress if a severe storm event were to occur at a critical time during \nthe construction period. The progressive construction method for the \nnew  quay  should  minimize  the  extent  of  works  being  exposed  to \ndamage risk at any one time, and all movable construction equipment \nwould be secured ahead of an approaching storm. In addition, the \nconstruction methodology will involve phasing of the quay construction \nto allow for uninterrupted port operations.  \nInstitutional  risks  lie  in  the  Government\u2019s  adequately  supporting \nimproved  oversight  of  the  maritime  sector  by  the  CIIC  and  public \nauditor,  and  in  the  CIPA\u2019s  fully  implementing  and  maintaining  an \neffective assets management plan over the 30-year life of the new port \ninfrastructure.  Inadequate  asset  management  could  lead  to  a \nshortening of the service life and reduction in the economic benefits \nand EIRR of the Project. These risks will be mitigated by ADB technical \nassistance  for  improving  infrastructure  services  delivery  and  asset \nmanagement. \n ", "159o  55'W 165 o 50'W 159 o 50'W\nPenhryn\nRakahanga\nCOOK ISLANDS 10o  55'S Pukapuka Manihiki 10 o 55'S\nAVATIU PORT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT Nassau\nN     O     R     T     H     E     R     N              G     R     O    U     P\nSuwarrow\nS  O  U  T  H      P  A  C  I  F  I  C      O  C  E  A  N\nAvatiu Port\nAVARUA Palmerston\nRarotonga\nNikao International Airport 18 o 55'S AitutakMianuae 18 o 55'S\nTakutea Mitiaro\nMauke\nPROJECT AREA Atiu\nS    O      U    T      H    E     R     N \nAVARUA\nMatavera  G     R    O     U    P \nRAROTONGA\nMangaia\n165 o 50'W 159 o 50'W\nArorangi\nRAROTONGA\n21o  30'S Ngatangiia 21o  30'S\nNational Capital\nMotutapu Locality\nRoad\nOneroa Reef\nMuri\nKoromiri\nTaakoka\nN\nTitikaveka\n0 1 2\nKilometers\n0\n8\n-4 M\n2\n94 a\na E 159o  55'W p \nG 1", "COOK ISLANDS\nGENERAL ARRANGEMENT OF AVATIU PORT PROJECT\nWiden entrance\n channel\nM\nAIN  Relocate rip-rap and slope breakwater\nRO head and overtapping drainage channel\nA\nD\nWESTERN BASIN\nRemove old\nsheet piling\nRelocate rip-rap\nNew Quay\nStructure\nLimit of Dredging Remove existing\nwharf and apron\nDredge to\n\u20138.0mCD\nRip-rap faced embankment\n150.0000\nRemove existing Patrol\nboat landing and slipway\nNavigation Buoy Punanga Nui\nCargo Shed Rehabilitate\ndomestic wharf\nRoad\nMAIN ROAD\n0 Realign entrance\n8-42 lead light M\n94 AVATIU ROAD a\nb E p\nG  2", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the Cook Islands for the Avatiu Port Development Project.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  The Cook Islands comprise 15 small volcanic islands and coral atolls with a total land \narea of 240 square kilometers, spread over an ocean area of 1.8 million square kilometers. A \nnorthern group of islands is separated from the southern group by about 1,200 km. The total \npopulation is estimated at about 21,100.1 The principal island, Rarotonga, is only about 6 km in \ndiameter, and has a population of around 14,000. The second most populous island group is the \natoll of Aitutaki, with a population of about 2,100 people. The balance of the population is \ndistributed among 11 of the remaining 13 islands. In addition to the resident population, tourists \nnumber around 3,000 at any one time, mostly on Aitutaki and Rarotonga. \n \n3.  The national economy has performed strongly in recent years. Growth in gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) averaged 4.1% from 2004 to 2007, led by the private sector (particularly tourism \nand retail trade). Tourism is the most important economic driver and now contributes over 50% \nof total GDP. Use of the New Zealand dollar (NZ$) as the local currency helps to contain \ninflation. The average annual increase in the consumer price index was 2.6% from 2004 to \n2007. \n \n4.  The Cook Islands is heavily dependent on imports, and service exports from tourism \nlargely cover the merchandise trade deficit. Pearls and fisheries are key merchandise exports, \nbut these contribute just 0.8% and 0.5% of GDP, respectively. Their production has declined \nsignificantly in recent years due to disease in the pearl farms, intense market competition, and \ndepleted fish stocks.  \n \n5.  Transport in the Cook Islands is well-developed. The gateway international airport is in \nRarotonga, with airstrips on several of the outer islands catering to domestic air traffic. The two \nmain  islands,  Rarotonga  and  Aitutaki,  contain  64%  of  the  country\u2019s  road  network  of  392 \nkilometers  of  sealed  and  unsealed  roads  (in  the  outer  islands,  roads  are  almost  entirely \nunsealed). \n \n6.  The Cook Islands port infrastructure comprises two international ports\u2014at Avatiu near \nthe main town of Avarua on Rarotonga and at Aitutaki\u2014plus a small domestic port and jetty \nfacilities on each of the 13 outer islands. The latter handle interisland traffic only. Avatiu port \nhandles about 90% of total imports by sea, and Aitutaki accounts for the balance. International \ncargo destined for the outer islands is transshipped at Avatiu. The volume of international \nexports by sea is minor and largely comprised of fish. The ports at Avatiu and Aitutaki are \noperated by the Cook Islands Ports Authority (CIPA), and the outer island ports are under the \njurisdiction of the Office of the Minister of Island Administration (OMIA) and the individual island \nadministrations. OMIA is a government department granted an annual budget allocation to \nprovide essential services to the outer islands, including transportation, energy, and water. \n \n7.  Avatiu  port  is  managed  by  CIPA.  CIPA  is  a  Crown-owned  statutory  corporation \nestablished  by  Parliament  under  the  Ports  Authority  Act  1995  to  provide  commercially \n                                                 \n1  Statistics Office. 2008. Social Statistics. Rarotonga. ", "2 \nsustainable port facilities and develop growth opportunities from the port assets, which include \nCrown land and buildings, wharves and marina, port facilities, tugboats, plant and equipment, \nstorage sheds, and hardstand areas. CIPA levies ports charges at both Rarotonga and Aitutaki, \nalthough the ports operations are under separate management. The newly rehabilitated marina \nat  Avatiu  Harbor  began  providing  revenue  to  CIPA  in  2008.  Cook  Islands  Investment \nCorporation (CIIC)2 presently collects the rent on land and buildings within the port area from a \nliquefied petroleum gas (LPG) company and several food concessions. These rents and any \nrentals from future concessions will accrue to CIPA following transfer of the land from the \ncontrol of CIIC to CIPA in 2008. Stevedoring is outsourced to the private sector, but CIPA owns \nand operates the heavy forklift equipment in the container yard. \n \n8.  CIPA has produced deficits for 4 out of the last 5 years. It provides approximately \nNZ$400,000 per year of free services under community service obligations, however, including \nberthing for interisland shipping and the Government\u2019s patrol boat, storage facilities, and a \nbuilding for the Maritime Surveillance and Marine Service at the Avatiu port. The port operations \nin Aitutaki are not commercially viable and are subsidized from CIPA\u2019s Avatiu port revenues. \nInclusion into the accounts of this revenue forgone would allow CIPA to show a profit for those \nyears. In 2007, the management of CIPA changed with the resignation of the general manager \nand  the  chairman  of  the  board.  Following  the  appointment  of  new  board  members  and \nreplacement of the general manager, CIPA has adopted an enhanced commercial focus that is \nexpected to improve its performance in the future and ensure its financial sustainability. CIPA \nkeeps comprehensive annual accounts that are produced and audited by outside auditors in a \ntimely manner. CIPA does not itself have professionally qualified accounting staff. Budgets are \nprepared  by  management  on  an  annual  basis  for  approval  by  the  board.  CIPA  does  not \ncurrently have a business plan or asset management plan, nor does it carry out multiyear \nbudgeting. CIPA controls port charges, and the tariff structure was recently revised. A new \nstructure with an 8.5% increase in ship services and berthing tariffs will become effective from \nFY2009. The revised tariffs include marine service charges, tugboat charges, vessel moves, \nberth hire, goods wharfage, equipment hire and demurrage, storage, and transport. These will \nresult in an anticipated increase in income of around 5% per year relative to application of the \nexisting tariff schedule that was last revised in August 2005. The revised tariffs, which have \nbeen  increased  roughly  in  line  with  inflation,  will  provide  for  an  operating  profit  (including \ndepreciation but before interest and tax) equal to 8% of average fixed assets, which is an \nacceptable return on the assets employed. \n \n9.  Imports, comprising dry goods (containers, vehicles, break-bulk, and bulk items such as \ncement, timber, and other building materials) are transported by two vessels, one operated by \nReef  Shipping  and  the  other  by  the  Pacific  Forum  Line,  with  a  ship  in  port  at  Avatiu \napproximately every 10 days. Petroleum liquid fuels (automotive diesel, unleaded gasoline, and \njet A1) are delivered to Rarotonga about once a month and LPG about once every 2 months. \n \n10.  The Avatiu port also serves tourism, with increasing numbers of yachts and pleasure \nboats and especially passenger cruise ships. Calls by yachts increased from 113 in 2003 to 137 \nin 2007. Thirty-seven cruise ships visited Rarotonga in 2007 (54% more than in 2003), but very \nfew of them are able to berth at the quay. The cruise ships, most of which anchor outside the \nreef, are up to 200 meters (m) in length and passengers are generally brought ashore by tender \nfor day excursions. Just the smallest cruise vessels are able to berth at the quay. Only about \n40% of the passengers opt to come ashore if use of a tender is required, whereas 90% of \npassengers disembark when a vessel berths alongside. \n                                                 \n2  The Cook Islands Investment Corporation is a statutory organization established as a holding company for the \nGovernment\u2019s state-owned enterprises, including CIPA. \n ", "3 \n11.  Vessels that use the wharf most frequently are local fishing vessels, averaging 5\u20137 calls \nper week with stays of a week or more, plus private yachts and tour boats. This small boat traffic \ncauses some congestion in the harbor at busy periods, although calls by local and foreign \nfishing vessels have fallen considerably since 2004 due to poor fishing conditions. Apart from a \nsmall quantity of air cargo, all overseas imports to the outer islands are transshipped through \nthe  port  of  Avatiu,  emphasizing  the  critical  lifeline  role  that  the  port  plays  in  the  national \neconomy. The number of vessels available for transporting passengers and cargo to the outer \nislands has recently been reduced to one, due to marine accidents, and the frequency of service \nis now reduced. \n  \n12.  Aitutaki Harbor comprises the Arutanga Channel leading to a small basin and finger \nquay. Ships cannot berth at the quay because of the limited channel depth and restricted basin \nspace.  A  lighter  operation  uses  two  old  barges  to  transfer  cargo  ashore.  Infrastructure \ndevelopment needs at Aitutaki are deepening and widening of the channel and basin, repairs to \nthe quay and pavements, upgraded navigation aids, and covered storage for plant and goods. \nThese major improvements are not economically viable, however, and do not form part of this \nproject. \n \n13.  The harbors in the outer islands typically comprise a channel cut through the reef flat to \na small basin containing a dock area and small boat ramp. Some harbors have concrete \nseawalls to provide a measure of protection to the channel and basin. Typically, the landing \narea is a concrete dock and small hardstand. Each island has one or more barges or large \ndinghies for transferring cargoes from the ship. The smallest islands have no harbor, and so \ngoods and passengers must be ferried to the reef flat or landed through a reef channel to a \nbeach. No fees are levied by OMIA to users of outer island ports facilities.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n1.  Infrastructure Constraints \n \n14.  In 2007, the Government adopted a 20-year Preventive Infrastructure Master Plan (IMP) \nthat was prepared under technical assistance (TA) from Asian Development Bank (ADB)3 as an \nintegral part of the National Sustainable Development Plan 2007\u20132010 (NSDP).4 The IMP \nranked infrastructure development projects using a multi-criteria analysis and recommended \npriority investments needed for sustainable economic growth in the immediate, medium, and \nlong terms. The IMP also assessed the condition and management of existing infrastructure, \nconcluding that lack of investment in maintenance, rehabilitation, and upgrading has resulted in \naging systems that do not provide appropriate levels of service for current demand and that this \nplaces sustained economic development at risk. Following the IMP, ADB funded a project \npreparatory technical assistance (PPTA)5 for preparing an infrastructure development project \n(IDP) with detailed feasibility studies for a number of priority infrastructure investments including \ntechnical, financial, economic, environmental, social, and poverty assessments in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s policies and guidelines. The studies supported priority implementation for a 5-year \nIDP.  \n \n15.  The PPTA reviewed the status of the physical infrastructure, as well as the economic \nand social consequences of delay or inaction in rectifying critical deficiencies.

The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n16.  In addition to the physical infrastructure upgrading and rehabilitation needs, institutional \ncapacity constraints exist within some of the infrastructure agencies. These constraints impact \non  operations,  cost  recovery,  and,  consequently,  on  the  regularity  and  quality  of  basic \ninfrastructure service delivery. Institutional arrangements are fragmented, overlapping, and lack \ncoordination.  Thus,  there  are  management  weaknesses  and  a  lack  of  clear  ownership  of \npolicies, planning, and regulatory responsibility. A review  of institutional arrangements and \ncapacity  was  undertaken  under  the  PPTA,  and  recommendations  for  an  infrastructure \ngovernance framework were prepared. The Government is expected to adopt these in 2008. \nThe recommendations aimed to enhance management of existing and future infrastructure (with \na focus on projects to be constructed under the IDP and follow-on projects for the IMP\u2019s 20-year \nhorizon) while improving results-focused service delivery and asset management. \n \n17.  The governance framework will involve improved planning, institutional arrangements, \ncapacity development, policies, and arrangements for cost recovery. It will provide (i) rigorous \nplanning and investment criteria for vetting infrastructure proposals; (ii) an asset management \nregime  that  includes  adequate  resource  allocations  for  asset  maintenance  and  asset \nmanagement plans that are subject to annual audit; and (iii) arrangements for ensuring sector \nsustainability, including institutional arrangements, through regular reviews of tariff regimes and \nprivate sector participation. ADB will provide separate TA6 to help the Government implement \nthis framework, and the principal benefits to the current project will accrue through improved \nasset management and institutional arrangements for tariff reviews. \n \n2.  Port Sector Constraints \n \n18.  The Cook Islands is highly dependent on imports to meet its basic needs, as well as to \nretain competitiveness and encourage growth in tourism, its main industry. All international sea \ntrade (with the exception of a small proportion destined for Aitutaki, which receives containers \nand other cargoes directly from New Zealand) passes through Avatiu port on the main island of \nRarotonga.  All  domestic  cargo  destined  for  the  outer  islands  originates  from  Avatiu  port. \nTherefore,  the  Cook  Islands  economy  heavily  relies  on  the  continued  serviceability  and \nefficiency of the port to guard against disruptions to import flows and to contain sea transport \ncosts. The Government recognizes that the primary mainstay of the economy is tourism, which \nrequires access to high quality and affordable imports for its survival and growth. \n \n19.  The harbor cannot handle ships above approximately 90 m in length, and the berth is \nlimited to a 6 m draft. That effectively excludes cargo vessels above 4,000 tons, and most cruise \nships must transfer passengers by ship\u2019s boat. The port has suffered periodic damage from \ncyclones and emergency procedures are in place to minimize losses when cyclones occur. The \nexisting wharf was constructed in 1989. It is in a state of advanced deterioration, due to \ndeficiencies in the design and poor construction. The quay face and parts of the wharf deck are \nvulnerable to sudden failure, which could be triggered by storm or vessel impact. Such failures \nwill involve unplanned and increasingly expensive emergency repairs as the wharf continues to \ndeteriorate. Meanwhile, serviceability will be reduced and operating costs increased. In addition, \nthe width of the harbor entrance, size of the turning basin, and deteriorated surface of the port \nyard constrain efficient operations. Full reconstruction of the quay is urgently needed, along with \ndeepening and widening of the harbor to accommodate the next generation of cargo vessels \n                                                 \n6  TA  funded  by  the  Japan  Special  Fund  for  improving  the  delivery  of  infrastructure  services  is  planned  for \nimplementation from 2009 until 2012. \n ", "5 \nand larger cruise ships. Upgrading of the wharf could facilitate berthing at least 70% of all cruise \nships that currently call. A problems and constraints analysis is included in Appendix 2, and its \nmajor elements are summarized below: \n \n(i)  The harbor entrance and turning basin. (a) Inadequate channel width for safe \nnavigation of ships; (b) navigation aids are generally limited to leading lights with \nlittle delineation of the entrance channel; and (c) insufficient maneuvering area \nwithin the harbor to turn ships, with the length of vessels restricted to 90 m.  \n(ii)  Quay structure. (a) Deterioration of the cope beam, with extensive concrete \nspalling and corrosion of reinforcement exacerbated by numerous contacts by \nberthing ships; (b) gaps between the concrete sheet piles, cracked and broken \npiles  with  reinforcement  projecting  from  the  wall,  short  piles  not  driven  to \nsufficient depth to meet design parameters; (c) inadequate fenders comprising \nlarge truck tires with little berthing energy absorption capacity and supplemented \nrecently by cylindrical fenders slung horizontally from the wharf (one of which has \nalready been damaged); (d) original bollards in poor condition and of limited \ncapacity (approximately 20 tons), supplemented by new 100-ton bollards but with \nunknown foundation integrity; (e) reduced draft adjacent to the quay face due to \nconcrete repairs at the base of the wall, debris on the seabed that includes \ndiscarded tire fenders, precast kerbs, and large boulders; and (f) corrosion of the \nwall anchorage steel tie bars, and particularly the quay face threads, nuts, and \nanchor plates. \n(iii)  Port container handling yard. (a) Areas of badly cracked concrete pavement \nand gaps between slabs, and (b) voids that have opened under slabs adjacent to \nthe quay due to the leaching of fines (the full extent of which will not become \nclear until the deck is removed and reconstructed). \n(iv)  Capacity.  CIPA  lacks  capacity  for  (a)  financial  management,  and  (b)  asset \nmanagement. A qualified accountant is needed to control increasingly complex \nfinancial  operations  as  the  port  increases  its  commercial  focus.  An  asset \nmanagement engineer is required to exercise tighter control and pursue better \nplanning of maintenance functions. \n \n20.  In addition to deterioration, the size of ship that can be berthed and turned safely within \nthe  harbor  is  limited.  The  port  presently  fails  to  meet  international  standards  for  the  safe \noperation  of  container  and  fuel  tanker  vessels.  Issues  include  inadequate  slip  clearance \ndistances between vessels and permanent structures, insufficient working load capacity of the \nmooring bollards due to weaknesses in the wharf structure, an inadequate fendering system, \nand considerable debris and concrete rubble below the waterline and on the harbor floor that \ndamage the hulls of large vessels. The harbor and berths limit the vessel draft, having an \nuneven depth of about 6\u20137 m below chart datum, a confined turning basin (effective diameter of \nabout 120 m), and a narrow harbor entrance (about 100 m width). International tanker and \ncargo vessels that currently use the harbor are typically 86\u201390 m long, the maximum size that \ncan be handled by the port, and these are operating outside proper safety margins in terms of \nunderkeel clearance and turning room. The existing wharf is not straight over its length in plan, \nwith a change in angle (about 120 m from the harbor entrance) that both prevents long vessels \nfrom turning and constrains use of the berthing length. By 2011, longer and deeper draft vessels \nare expected to be employed by the international shipping industry for cargo deliveries to Pacific \nports. These will not be able to be accommodated at Avatiu. \n \n21.  Upgrading of harbor facilities in the outer islands is also a priority under the NSDP. \nExisting  infrastructure  is  inadequate  for  efficient  transfer  of  goods  (including  containerized \naviation fuel) to shore. The Government is planning to repair and improve harbor facilities in the \n ", "6 \nouter  islands  with  its  own  financing  plus  financing  from  the  Cyclone  Recovery  and \nReconstruction Program of the New Zealand Agency for International Development (NZAID). \nDesign and procurement for upgrading of the Mangaia, Mauke, and Mitiaro harbors is planned \nfor FY2009 under the Cyclone Recovery and Reconstruction Program, and the Government will \nconstruct a jetty and associated works at Nassau using its own resources. NZAID is expected to \ncontinue  with  its  support  for  development  of  outer  island  harbors  under  its  Outer  Islands \nDevelopment Program. Past external assistance to the ports and maritime sector is shown in \nAppendix 3. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n22.  The impact of the Project will be continued economic growth and well-being of the \npopulation (particularly the disadvantaged). The Project aligns with government policy outlined \nin the NSDP. The Project addresses two key strategic goals of the NSDP: (i) an innovative and \nwell-managed  private  sector-led  economy;  and  (ii)  strengthened  and  affordable  basic \ninfrastructure, transport, and utilities to support national development. By safeguarding the \ncontinued efficient operations and expansion of the port, the Project will ensure that facilities \nrequired  for  private  sector-led  economic  growth  are  strengthened  and  risks  to  operational \nefficiency are removed.  \n \n23.  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  2008\u20132012 7  recognizes  that  maintaining \nmacroeconomic  stability  depends  on  removing  the  binding  constraints  to  environmentally \nsustainable  private  sector-led  economic  growth  and  improving  the  quality  of  public  sector \ngovernance. The strategic focus proposed for the partnership strategy is derived from the NSDP \nand addresses these constraints through improved economic and social infrastructure and \npublic sector service delivery. This directly supports implementation of the NSDP. \n \n24.  The Project will address existing deficiencies and constraints and bring the port and \nharbor up to acceptable international maritime safety standards by reconstructing the quay and \npart of the wharf area, thus extending its life by 30 years, and by increasing the harbor and \nport\u2019s capacity for the current and larger vessels expected to call in the future. \n \n25.  The outcome of the Project will be a secure and efficient port infrastructure in Rarotonga \nwith constraints and safety risks removed. The Project will enhance safety and bring ship \nberthing and maneuvering within the harbor more closely into line with accepted maritime \nindustry practice. At present, the operations of Avatiu Harbor are at the limits of safe operation \nfor the larger vessels using the port, and there is a risk that, as the port deteriorates, shipping \noperators may have difficulty in obtaining insurance and decide that they can no longer service \nthe Cook Islands with their existing or replacement vessels. \n \n26.  The Project will also widen and deepen the harbor and realign the quay to enable the \nport to handle larger cargo ships, thereby ensuring that the port remains resilient in the face of \nchanging international conditions. The upgraded port will also be able to safely berth larger \nsizes of cruise ships (that are equipped with bow thrusters8) that cannot presently enter Avatiu \nHarbor. The Project will stabilize the cost of port services and of imported goods to consumers, \nallowing for surety and predictability while stimulating economic growth. \n \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2008.

Outputs \n27.  The physical outputs of the Project are: (i) harbor dredged to 8 m below chart datum \n(from the current depth of about 6 m), (ii) widened harbor entrance (by approximately 10 m), (iii) \ndemolition of the outer and inner berths and replacement of them by a continuous quay (total \nstraight wharf face of 270 m), (iv) new sheet piling along the new quay wall, (v) rehabilitation of \nthe wharf deck back to 20 m from the wharf face, (vi) demolition of the old slip and patrol boat \nwharf and facing the embankment with riprap, (vii) providing protection to the northern end of \nthe quay by repositioning riprap at the western end of the breakwater, (viii) rearrangement of the \npetroleum-products  pipe  and  hazardous  materials  area,  (ix)  rehabilitated  south  (domestic) \nwharf, and (x) relocated cargo storage sheds. The proposed development of Avatiu port is \nshown on the outline concept drawing (Map 2). \n \n28.  Existing seabed depths within the harbor generally vary from 4.0 m to 6.0 m below chart \ndatum. For larger ships with drafts from 7.0 m to 7.5 m, a dredge depth of 8.0 m below chart \ndatum is proposed within the harbor. Incorporated in the scope of the dredging will be widening \nof the entrance channel on its western side to create a channel at least 100 m wide. This will \ninvolve the removal of an old sheet pile wall and repositioning of riprap on the reef flat at the \nentrance to CIPA\u2019s western marina development. Additional navigation aids will be provided at \nthe seaward end of the entrance channel. \n \n29.  To service larger cargo ships (up to 120 m in length) that will serve the port in the future, \na maneuvering area of some 150 m diameter is required. To achieve this, the existing patrol \nberth, an adjacent disused slipway, an existing government building housing a Department of \nMarine  Resources  store,  and  a  fast  food  outlet  will  be  demolished.  The  resulting  sloping \nembankment will be faced with riprap armor to protect against wave action. \n \n30.  The main wharf will be replaced by a new, realigned, and continuous sheet piled quay \nstructure 270 m long. To allow continuing port operations during the construction period, some \n110 m of the outer end of the existing international wharf will remain available while the inner \nsection of the quay is constructed on its new alignment. Once this is operational, the outer \nsection will be demolished in turn and the remainder of the wharf constructed. The quay will be \nfitted with appropriate fenders and  100-ton capacity bollards. To provide working space during \nconstruction and an improved working yard area for the new quay, an existing cargo shed will \nbe demolished and a new structure will be provided. As part of the quay construction, a new 20 \nm  wide  concrete  working  apron  will  be  constructed  to  levels  that  tie  in  with  the  existing \npavement levels and replacing the existing cracked and broken slab. Fuel supply pipelines will \nbe relocated by the operators in conjunction with the construction contract. The protective riprap \nand  the  adjacent  wave  overtopping  drainage  channel  at  the  western  end  of  the  northern \nbreakwater will be repositioned to provide full-depth access at the northern end of the quay. \n \n31.  The section of existing wharf on the south of the harbor basin (generally used for \ndomestic shipping and visiting yachts) is in relatively better condition than the section used for \ninternational shipping. The cope beam will be replaced and the bollards and fenders upgraded. \n \n32.  The  Project  will  climate-proof  the  wharf  by  replacing  the  existing  structure  that  is \nextremely vulnerable to wave action and forces with one that is fully resistant to such forces. \nAdditionally, the wharf will be designed such that it can be raised along with the container yard \nat some future date, should a rising sea level require it. Similarly, the design of the anchorage \npoints for the fendering system will allow the fenders to be set at a higher level if required.  \n \n ", "8 \nC.  Special Features \n \n33.  Donor Harmonization. The Project has been developed as a priority component of the \nIMP.  Implementation  of  other  priority  components  is  required  to  maximize  developmental \nimpacts.  Other  development  partners,  including  NZAID  and  the  European  Union,  have \nsubscribed to the need for rational prioritization among competing infrastructure development \nneeds that are within the absorptive capacity of institutions and the borrowing capacity of the \nGovernment, and they will integrate their assistance within the IDP. The People\u2019s Republic of \nChina has expressed interest in supporting priority components of the IDP with grant money or \nconcessional  loans.  To  build  on  this,  an  infrastructure  partnership  framework  is  being \ndeveloped,  initially  between  the  Government,  ADB,  NZAID,  and  the  European  Union.  The \nframework will set out the expected contributions of all the parties toward implementing the IDP \nand for supporting capacity development. \n \n34.  Asset  Management.  Infrastructure  asset  maintenance  is  weak  throughout  the \ngovernment-owned  infrastructure  sector  in  the  Cook  Islands,  and  the  port  sector  is  no \nexception. Accounting and financial management are weak, due to inadequate staff skills and \nqualifications. Much of the observed weakness relates to inadequate public sector oversight of \ninfrastructure service operations plus lack of a coordinated asset management and monitoring \nsystem. ADB TA, to be implemented over 4 years concomitant with the construction period of \nthe Project, is planned. Under a TA grant, it will improve infrastructure governance, establish a \nmechanism  for  public  sector  oversight  and  monitoring  of  infrastructure  services,  and  build \ncapacity within service provider institutions (including CIPA) to carry out appropriate asset and \nfinancial management functions. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n \n35.  The project investment cost is estimated at $18.2 million, including taxes and duties of \n$2.2 million. The costs of the various components are summarized in Table 1 and detailed in \nAppendix 4. \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem    Amountsa \nA.  Base Costb    \n       \n  1.

Financing Plan \n \n36.  The Government has requested ADB to provide a blend of two loans totaling $15.5 \nmillion equivalent, comprising an ordinary capital resources (OCR) loan of $8.6 million and an \nAsian Development Fund (ADF) loan of $6.9 million. The OCR loan will have a term of 25 years \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% \nper annum, and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the Loan Agreement. The \nGovernment has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions; and (ii) an undertaking \nthat these choices were independently made, without relying on any communication or advice \nfrom ADB. The Government will bear the currency risk of the loan. \n \n37.  The ADF loan will have a maturity of 32 years that includes a grace period of 8 years, an \ninterest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, equal \namortization, and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the loan agreement. The \ncurrency risk of the loan will be borne by the Government. \n \n38.  The Government will onlend the proceeds of the loans to CIPA through a subsidiary loan \nagreement on terms and conditions acceptable to ADB. The subsidiary loan agreement shall be \nexecuted on the same financial and other terms and conditions as required in the project loan \nagreements. \n \n39.  ADB will finance 85.2% of the total project cost, including taxes and duties, and the \nGovernment will fund the balance (14.8%).9 Consideration has been given to the amount of \ntaxes and duties, and these do not constitute an excessive share of project costs. The cost \nestimates are summarized by financing agency in Table 2 and detailed in Appendix 4. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million equivalent) \nSource  Total    % \nAsian Development Bank  15.51    85.2 \n  Ordinary Capital Resources  8.63    47.4 \n  Asian Development Fund  6.88    37.8 \nGovernment  2.68    14.8 \n  Total    18.20    100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n40.  The  debt  incurred  to  finance  the  Avatiu  port  needs  to  be  sustainable.  A  debt \nsustainability analysis carried out by ADB in April 2007 and updated debt projections prepared \nin August 2008 conclude that the additional borrowing required for the port is sustainable. The \nproposed ADB loan for the port, a loan recently secured from the People\u2019s Republic of China for \ngovernment buildings and sports facilities, and a proposed loan from the European Investment \nBank for energy and airport investments are projected to raise the ratio of net government debt \nto GDP to about 25%. Debt servicing costs are projected to peak at 3% of revenue and remain \nbelow  5% of  exports of  goods  and  services.  Such  debt  indicators  are  substantially  below \nrelevant debt thresholds. Debt indicators would remain comfortably within threshold levels even \nif there were no growth in GDP or exports of goods and services and if revenue generated by \nthe loan projects were to fall below projections. \n \n                                                 \n9  The country cost-sharing ceiling is up to 99% for lending and nonlending products. Taxes and duties will be \nfinanced by ADB. \n ", "10 \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n41.  CIPA  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  Project.  Under  the  direction  of  its  chief \nexecutive, who shall be the project director, a project office will be established within CIPA. \nCIPA will strengthen its administrative capacity to cater for the Project\u2019s ongoing operations, \nincluding  management  of  port  assets.  At  a  minimum,  additional  staff  to  be  recruited  to \npermanent positions within CIPA will comprise a professionally qualified chief financial officer \n(CFO) and a port asset management engineer. The chief executive, chief financial officer, and \nport asset management engineer will form the project management team, which will have core \nresponsibility for the oversight and financial administration of the Project. \n \n42.  The board of the CIIC will be the steering committee for the Project. The chief executive \nof CIPA will present reports on the Project\u2019s technical and financial progress to the regular \nmeetings of the CIIC board, and to such special meetings as that board shall deem necessary. \nAs the steering committee, the CIIC board will review progress and will keep the Government \ncognizant of any issues or concerns, as well as the remedial action proposed in relation to \nthese. The CIIC board will also ensure that the interests of stakeholders are respected and \nappropriately catered for during the port construction activities. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n43.  The Project will be implemented over 37 months, from May 2009 to May 2012. The \npreconstruction activities such as the design review, the preparation of prequalification and \nbidding  documents,  and  the  tendering  and  award  of  the  contract  will  begin  in  May  2009. \nInvitations to bid will be issued to prequalified bidders by November 2009. The civil works for the \nport  facilities  are  expected  to  start  in  June  2010  and  be  completed  by  April  2012.  The \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 5. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n44.  All  procurement  for  works  under  the  ADB,  ADF,  and  OCR  loans  will  follow  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The procurement will consist \nmainly of civil works to increase the operating life and capacity of Avatiu port. A procurement \nplan is in Appendix 6. \n \n45.  The civil works, involving reconstruction and realignment of the international quay and \npart of the wharf deck, widening of the harbor entrance, and dredging to increase the depth \nalongside the berths and ship turning area, will be grouped into one contract package and \ntendered under international competitive bidding procedures. International competitive bidding \nprocurement in a single contract package is proposed so as to attract international bidders and \nto reduce administrative pressure on the executing agency. International contractors will be \nencouraged  to  subcontract  packages  of  work  to  the  national  construction  industry  where \ncapability and capacity exist and can be efficiently employed. Procurement will follow a single \nstage, one-envelope international bidding process with prequalification. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n46.  The Project will provide for engaging consultants to support the project management \nteam in (i) reviewing the design concepts, plans, and documents for the port improvements \ncompleted during the PPTA in consultation with CIPA; (ii) preparing the detailed design of the \n ", "11 \nproposed  port  improvements  and  recomputing  the  cost  estimates  and  the  economic  and \nfinancial analysis to confirm project viability and affordability; (iii) preparing a system for project \nperformance monitoring acceptable to ADB for the performance targets and key indicators in the \ndesign  and  monitoring  framework,  including  collection  and  reporting  of  baseline  project \nperformance monitoring information; (iv) compiling the contract documents and specifications; \n(v) in consultation with CIPA, conducting the prequalification of bidders; (vi) preparing bidding \ndocuments that recognize the need to maintain port operations throughout construction; (vii) \nhandling the bidding process; (viii) evaluating the bids received and preparing a bid evaluation \nreport and recommendation to CIPA and CIIC on contract award; (ix) assisting CIPA and CIIC in \nexecuting  the  contract;  (x)  managing  and  supervising  the  construction  contract;  and  (xi) \nproviding environmental and social monitoring and management services over the course of the \nProject. \n \n47.  A total of about 92 person-months of consulting services will be required comprising 35 \nperson-months  of  international  and  57  person-months  of  national  consulting  services.  All \nconsulting  services  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time) using the quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod. A ratio of 80:20 will apply to quality and cost, respectively. Outline terms of reference \nfor consultants are in Appendix 7. \n \n5.  Advance Action and Retroactive Financing \n \n48.  The Project is both revenue-generating and critical to ensuring the continuing operations \nof the existing facilities. As time is critical to the financial and economic viability of the Project, \nthe Government has asked ADB to approve advance action for recruiting consultants and \nprocuring civil works. Advance action covers prequalification, invitation of bids, bidding, bid \nevaluation, and limited contract award. The advance action will conform to ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The Government has been advised that \napproval of the advance action, if granted, does not commit ADB to financing the Project. \n \n49.  To meet the implementation schedule, preconstruction activities must start in 2008. The \nProject will provide retroactive financing for project management, including consulting services. \nRetroactive  financing will  be  permitted  only  if  (i)  it is specifically agreed  by  ADB  and  the \nBorrower in the loan agreement and only pursuant to the terms of the relevant agreement; (ii) \nthe  goods,  works,  services,  and  consultants  for  which  it  is  requested  are  procured  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines or Guidelines on the Use of Consultants; and \n(iii) the amount to be retroactively financed does not exceed 5% from the OCR loan and 5% \nform the ADF loan respectively. The expenditures must have been incurred before effectiveness \nof the loan, but not earlier than 12 months before the signing date of such loan agreement. \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n50.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government, CIPA, and CIIC. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of the executing agency and all contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n ", "12 \n7.  Grievance and Redress Mechanism \n \n51.  A complaint and problem management procedure will be established under the Ministry \nof  Finance  and  Economic  Management  to  (i)  review  and  address  grievances  of  project \nstakeholders  in  relation  to  either  the  Project,  any  of  the  service  providers,  or  any  person \nresponsible for carrying out the Project; and (ii) set the threshold criteria and procedures for \nhandling such grievances, for proactively responding to them, and for providing the stakeholders \nwith notice of the chosen mechanism or action. \n \n8.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n52.  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended form time to time). Direct payment procedures will be used for \nthe civil works contract and consulting services. CIPA will establish an imprest account, for the \nADF loan only, at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB, with an initial advance equivalent to \nestimated eligible project expenditures for the next 6 months to be paid through the imprest \naccount or $50,000, whichever is less. The imprest account will be established, managed, \nliquidated,  and  replenished  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and \ndetailed arrangements agreed by the Government and ADB. The statement of expenditure \nprocedure will be used to reimburse eligible expenditures and to liquidate and replenish the \nimprest account for individual payments of $25,000 and below. \n \n9.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n53.  CIPA will make arrangements that are satisfactory to ADB for reporting progress on \nproject  implementation.  CIPA  will  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  progress  reports  concerning \npreconstruction activities and construction of all civil works, including physical and financial \nprogress;  status  of  environmental  management  and  institutional  development;  asset \nmanagement;  financial  administration  and  forward  budgeting;  institutional  capacity  building; \npublic  communications;  and  other  activities  critical  to  project  implementation.  To  facilitate \nperformance monitoring and post-project review, the Government will provide ADB, within 3 \nmonths  of  physical  completion  of  the  Project,  a  completion  report  covering  project \nimplementation details, costs and benefits, and any other information that may be required by \nADB. In addition, CIPA will establish a website within 2 months of loan effectiveness for public \ndissemination of project information and periodic project reports. \n \n54.  CIPA will maintain separate records and accounts for the Project that identify the goods \nand  services  financed  from  the  loan,  expenditures  incurred  for  the  Project,  and  use  of \ncounterpart funds. The project accounts will be established and maintained in accordance with \nsound accounting principles and practices that will follow internationally accepted accounting \nstandards. The project accounts and annual financial statements will be subject to annual \nexternal audit by auditors acceptable to ADB. The annual audit reports will include an auditor\u2019s \nopinion on the use of the loan proceeds and compliance with the financial covenants included in \nthe loan and project agreements. A separate opinion will be provided on the use of the imprest \naccount and statement of expenditure procedures. The Government will provide ADB with the \nannual audited financial statements, audited project accounts, audit reports, and management \nletters and other related statements in English, and no later than 6 months after the end of each \nfiscal year for the entire implementation period. ADB will issue a formal warning for accounts \nmore than 6 months overdue and will suspend the disbursement for accounts that are 12 \nmonths overdue. \n \n ", "13 \n10.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n55.  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, and with TA provided by the detailed design and \nconstruction supervision consultants, CIPA will agree with ADB a system for monitoring and \nevaluating the performance of the Project in relation to its expected impact and outcomes as set \nout in the design and monitoring framework. CIPA will monitor and evaluate the Project\u2019s \nprogress annually throughout construction, and it shall prepare annual reports to ADB within 3 \nmonths of the end of each calendar year. \n \n11.  Project Review \n \n56.  ADB, the Government, and CIPA will undertake semiannual and midterm reviews of the \nProject to consider (i) compliance with the loan covenants, (ii) physical achievements against \nmilestones, (iii) loan disbursements and financial progress, and (iv) project implementation \nissues requiring resolution or action. The midterm review shall be undertaken within 15 months \nof the loan effectiveness date. At the midterm review, the Government and ADB will review in \ndetail the project design and implementation progress to identify areas for strengthening and \nimprovement to ensure smooth implementation and achievement of the project objectives. All \nassumptions and risks noted in the design and monitoring framework will be reviewed. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Economic Benefit \n \n57.  The economic analysis (Appendix 8) compares with- and without-project scenarios. The \nassessment covers the period 2009\u20132036 and assumes a construction period of 2.5 years \nstarting in the second half of 2009. All benefits and costs are in constant 2008 prices. \n \n58.  In the without-project scenario, it is expected that international cargo deliveries through \nAvatiu  Harbor  in  the  near-  and  long-term  future  will  be  subject  to  steeply  rising  costs  in \ncomparison with current costs, and for three reasons: (i) continued reliance on 4,000-ton (85\u201390 \nm) vessels within the confines of the existing harbor basin will require replacing the existing, \naging vessels (to be retired in the next 5 years) with new custom-built vessels at a much higher \ncost per ton than previously, since vessels of this class are no longer a mainstream line of the \ninternational shipbuilding industry; (ii) continued unchecked deterioration of the existing wharf \nstructure will, in the near term, raise risks to commercial shippers (and their insurers) and cause \nthem to suspend deliveries to Avatiu, forcing the government to charter small vessels (and \ninsure them at premium rates) to provide for continued deliveries at significantly higher cost than \ncommercial shipping rates; and (iii) continued deterioration will bring rising costs for emergency \nrepairs, which will be passed on in the form of higher port charges. In the without-project \nscenario,  all  of  these  increases  would  be  passed  on  to  consumers  in  the  form  of  higher \nwholesale and retail prices. In the with-project scenario, on the other hand, new and larger \n\u201cmainstream\u201d vessels may be accommodated in the harbor, thereby containing commercial \nshipping  costs  and  avoiding  the  costs  of  government  charters,  and  avoiding  the  costs  of \nemergency repairs to the wharf. \n \n59.  The  economic  costs  of  the  port  redevelopment  are  (i) capital  cost,  including  labor, \nequipment and materials, consulting services, and physical contingency; and (ii) maintenance \ncost. In comparing the with-project and without-project scenarios, the economic benefits of the \nProject arise from (i) savings in cargo and fuel delivery costs (i.e., in vessel capital cost and fuel \nand other operating costs), (ii) additional earnings from tourism due to increased berthing of \npassenger cruise vessels in the harbor, and (iii) avoided costs of frequent emergency repairs to \n ", "14 \nthe present port to keep it operating without the Project. The Project will also have other \nbenefits, such as supporting the delivery of essential social services and minimizing the cost of \nconsumer goods, most of which are imported and nearly all of which enter the country through \nthe Avatiu Harbor. These additional benefits are difficult to quantify and are therefore not \nincluded in the economic assessment. \n \n60.  At a 12% discount rate, the Project is economically viable. The net present value (NPV) \nis about $3.7 million (NZ$5.5 million) and the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is about \n15.9%. The savings in cargo and fuel delivery costs as well as income from additional cruise \nships  berthing  at  the  wharf  are  important  benefits.  Another  key  benefit  is  the  savings  in \noperation and maintenance of the port from refurbishing its structure, extending its life by 30 \nyears, and avoiding the necessity of frequent emergency repairs to keep it in operation. The \nProject will enable the port to handle increasing volumes of cargo efficiently, whereas without \nthe Project, the port would not be able to increase throughput and could continue to handle \npresent volumes only with difficulty\u2014and at increasing cost. \n \n61.  The EIRR calculation was subjected to sensitivity analysis to test the effects of negative \nchanges in the key parameters that determine the benefits and costs of the Project. The \nsensitivity analysis showed the Project to be economically viable with a 20% increase in costs or \na 20% decrease in all benefits. \n \n62.  A distribution analysis (presented in Appendix 8) concludes that the economic benefits of \nthe Project accrue chiefly to consumers in the form of cargo and fuel delivery cost savings, but \nalso to the Government and economy in the forms of taxes and additional tourism earnings. \n \nB.  Financial Benefit \n \n63.  A financial analysis was undertaken to assess the Project\u2019s viability and sustainability. \nRevenues and tariffs were analyzed to year 2025 to assess income from the port operations. \nThe analysis confirms CIPA\u2019s ability to boost income through sustainable port operations that \ngrow in line with the anticipated increases in goods and traffic handled by the port. It shows, too, \nthat CIPA will be able to achieve an appropriate pretax return on equity over the analysis period. \n \n64.  Financial  projections  have  been  prepared  for  CIPA  (Supplementary  Appendix  A)  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects \n(2005) to assess the financial viability and sustainability of the Project. The financial evaluation \nwas undertaken in real terms using constant 2008 prices. Incremental costs and benefits were \nderived under with- and without-project scenarios. \n \n65.  The  after-tax  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  of  the  Project  is  6.0%,  which \ncompares favorably with the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 1.23%. The financial \nnet  present  value  (FNPV)  is  NZ$19.1  million  ($12.8  million).  The  results  of  the  sensitivity \nanalyses  (20%  reduction  in  operating  revenues,  20%  increase  in  project  costs,  and  20% \nincrease in  port  operating  costs) confirm  the  robustness  of  the  Project\u2019s  financial  viability. \nDetails of the financial evaluation are in Appendix 9. \n \nC.  Environmental Impacts \n \n66.  The  Project  is  classified  as  Environmental  Category  B  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002) and the Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). Accordingly, \nan  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  has  been  prepared  for  the  proposed  Project \n(Supplementary Appendix B) and a summary IEE is in Supplementary Appendix C. The Project \n ", "15 \nwill  also  comply  with  the  Government\u2019s  environmental  requirements  as  specified  in  the \nEnvironmental  Act  2003,  and  thus  an  environmental  assessment  will  be  reviewed  by  the \nNational Environment Service (NES) and prior consent from NES will be obtained. \n \n67.  Potential impacts are mainly those associated with construction, particularly dredging of \n107,000 cubic meters (m3) of bottom sediment and 25,000 m3 of concrete rubble. Six samples \nof dredged materials taken from the proposed dredging area showed that they consist mostly of \nsands and coral rubbles, and the silt content is only 2%. Chemical analysis of the dredged \nsediment has confirmed the absence of toxic or otherwise harmful levels of contaminants that \nwould have required special consideration when selecting disposal sites. Environmental impacts \nof  dredging  will  be  mitigated  by  means  of  (i)  a  detailed  dredging  program,  with  proper \nsequencing of activities; (ii) use of a silt curtain; and (iii) staging and drying of spoil on-site, and \nstockpiling of  spoil  at the  contractor\u2019s  quarry.  About  10%  of  the material  will  be  used  for \nconstruction on-site, and the rest will be utilized off-site or disposed of in landfill areas. In \nprevious dredging activities, there was high demand for sand and rubble that resulted in sales to \nthe public as aggregate, fill, or soak pit material. \n \n68.  Overall, the IEE predicted insignificant environmental impacts of the Project because of \nthe following: (i) the Project will be undertaken within the footprint of the existing harbor and port \noperations, (ii) there are no sensitive habitats in the vicinity of the harbor, and (iii) the harbor has \nin  fact  undergone  previous  projects  of  a  similar  nature  (blasting,  dredging,  and  wharf \nconstruction) without significant environmental impacts (i.e., in 1980, there were dredged about \n200,000 m3 and in 2003 about 50,000 m3 mainly consisting of reef materials comprising coral \nboulders, gravel, and coarse sand). This material was used to create the current port facility \n(reclaimed land) east of the harbor, and also some of the reclaimed land in the Punanga Nui \nMarket area east of the port area (to create ramps up to the main road and parking areas in \nbetween the road and the wharves). \n \n69.  The IEE provides for an environmental management plan (EMP). The EMP will be \nrefined  during  detailed  design,  reflected  in  the  bidding  documents,  and  included  in  the \ncontractors\u2019 contracts for the Project. The contractors will be guided by the EMP in managing \nenvironmental impacts. A monitoring plan has been prepared to monitor key environmental \naspects, and it will provide feedback to the EMP as necessary.  \n \nD.  Social Impacts \n \n70.  The initial beneficiaries of lower costs from the proposed Project in comparison with the \nwithout-project scenario (para. 58) are private and public sector consumers in the Cook Islands, \nas they will avoid the impact of the steeply rising delivery costs that are expected if the harbor is \nallowed to continue deteriorating. The proposed project will result in avoiding increased costs of \nfood, fuel, and goods to consumers that would arise on account of increased freight charges \noccurring in the without-project scenario. Therefore, savings in cargo and fuel delivery costs \n(comparing  the  with-project  and  without-project  scenarios)  will  be  retained  by  ultimate \nconsumers of goods and fuel in the Cook Islands and not by shippers. The poor and socially \nexcluded will benefit from these cost savings, like all other consumers, but the benefit, as a \npercentage of household income, will be higher for them compared to most Cook Islanders. \nSecondary benefits of the Project, including economic spinoffs from new users of the port (such \nas  cruise  ships)  leading  to  increased  retail  trade,  should  also  percolate  through  the  local \npopulation in Rarotonga. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 10. \n \n \n ", "16 \nE.  Resettlement Impacts \n \n71.  Resettlement impacts are limited and can be mitigated. They include (i) the relocation of \ngoods from within a customs warehouse leased by Excil Shipping to another warehouse to be \nlocated nearby on-site, and (ii) the relocation of a small fish restaurant business presently \ncarried  out  in  leased  premises  on  port  land  opposite  the  wharf.  The  restaurant  will  be \nreestablished in a similar location off-site. Compensation will include lost profit and support of \nstaff  salaries.  There  have  been  consultations  with  the  affected  businesses,  and  initial \nagreements on relocation costs and compensation payable have been reached. Resettlement \nactions  will  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995).  A  summary  of  the \nresettlement plan is in Appendix 11 and the complete short resettlement plan is contained in \nSupplementary Annex D. All costs associated with resettlement will be financed by CIPA. There \nare no indigenous people or ethnic minorities within the Project\u2019s zone of influence. \n \nF.  Gender Impacts \n \n72.  There are no gender issues or specific opportunities for gender equality associated with \nthe proposed Project, given its very limited focus on construction and dredging. Nevertheless, \nthe  benefits  of  the  Project  will  be  pervasive,  benefiting  all  segments  of  the  Cook  Islands \npopulation including women, men, youth, and disadvantaged groups. \n \nG.  Risks \n \n73.  Technical risks lie in (i) continuity of port operations during construction, (ii) damage to \nthe new quay structure and to engineering plant in the event of a severe storm event occurring \nat critical times during the construction period, and (iii) the unknown extent of fill erosion below \nthe wharf deck and need for repair. These risks will be mitigated as follows: (i) the design \nprovides for half of the quay length to be available for shipping while the other half is under \nconstruction, (but some minor delays to commercial shipping cannot be entirely discounted); (ii) \nfishing boats and visiting yachts will be required to use the newly rehabilitated adjacent marina, \nowned and controlled by CIPA, while construction is underway; (iii) conservative estimates have \nbeen made of the extent and cost of any subsurface repairs in estimating the total cost of the \nwork; and (iv) the progressive construction method for the new quay should minimize the extent \nof works exposed to damage risk at any one time, and all movable construction equipment \nwould  be  secured  ahead  of  an  approaching  storm.  The  extent  of  fill  erosion beneath  the \nconcrete slab wharf deck, particularly the sections adjacent to the quay, will not be known until \nthe existing concrete deck slab has been removed. \n \n74.  Institutional risks lie in the Government\u2019s adequately supporting improved oversight of \nthe maritime sector by the CIIC and public auditor, and in the CIPA\u2019s fully implementing and \nmaintaining  an  effective  asset  management  plan  over  the  30-year  life  of  the  new  port \ninfrastructure. Inadequate asset management could lead to a shortening of the service life and \nreduction in the economic benefits and EIRR of the Project. These risks will be mitigated by (i) \nthe  separate  ADB  TA  for  improving  the  delivery  of  infrastructure  services  and  asset \nmanagement in general, and (ii) inclusion of specific assurances for the recruitment by CIPA \nand training of a ports asset management engineer. \n \n75.  Financial risks lie in the management effectiveness and financial control exercised by \nCIPA over its port operating costs, as well as in setting levels of port charges to adequately \nrecover these costs and to meet CIPA\u2019s debt service and Government dividend obligations. In \nthe event that CIPA would fail to operate profitably, the burden of debt servicing would be \npassed back to the Government to fund from general revenue. Mitigating the financial risks will \n ", "17 \nbe the support to the maritime sector for strengthening asset management under the separate \nADB TA and during the construction phase through the consultants\u2019 services for construction \nsupervision, as well as assurances regarding the appointment of a full-time, suitably qualified \nchief financial officer to the CIPA executive. \n \n76.  Economic risks lie in (i) the ongoing competitiveness of shipping services to the Cook \nIslands, and (ii) unforeseen and substantial increases in fuel prices and general transport costs. \nA reduction in competition might occur if there were to be a rationalization of shipping services \nonce the larger vessels come into service. The economic analysis has been conservative in not \nallocating all of the ship operating cost benefits to the Project, and the sensitivity analysis shows \nthe Project to be robust against this risk. Substantial increases in fuel prices and transport costs \ncould partially offset the beneficial effects of the Project (and particularly in the tourism sector) \non economic growth through real increases in the prices of imported goods and reduced export \ncompetitiveness. However, this risk would have equal or greater adverse effect if the Project \nwere not to be implemented. \n \n77.  Overall, the identified risks do not threaten the economic or financial viability of the \nProject and manageable risks can be mitigated through the project design. Institutional and \nfinancial risks will be mitigated by the separate ADB TA and the strengthening of CIPA\u2019s \nmanagement capacity. Detailed design and provision for strict technical oversight will mitigate \nengineering design and construction risks. The Project involves investment in basic lifeline \ninfrastructure that carries no risk of becoming obsolete or redundant and will generate benefits \ndirectly or indirectly for the entire Cook Islands community. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n78.

CIPA shall (a) ensure that the civil \nworks  contractors  are  monitored  closely  to  ensure  compliance  with  all \nenvironmental impact mitigation requirements in the EMP; and (b) prepare a \nreport on a quarterly basis on the mitigation monitoring and progress. \n(ix)  Labor standards. The Government and the CIPA shall ensure that provisions \nare stipulated in all civil works contracts to require contractors employed under \nthe  Project  to  incorporate  minimum  workplace  occupational  safety  norms, \nincluding the core labor standards as identified by the fundamental International \nLabor Organization conventions. The Government shall ensure that civil works \ncontractors comply with all applicable labor laws and do not employ child labor in \nany  aspect  of  their  activities.  The  Government  shall  ensure  that  contractors \nprovide appropriate training, and information materials, for workers on HIV/AIDS \nprevention, engaging a nongovernment organization with established capacity to \ndo so, and that contractors and their workers observe local protocols concerning \nacceptable behavior toward the local population. The Government and CIPA \nshall require contractors not to differentiate wages between men and women for \nwork of equal value. A specific clause shall be included in bidding documents, \nand compliance shall be strictly monitored during project implementation. \n(x)  Governance and anticorruption. The Government will cause CIPA to ensure \nthat (a) the Project is carried out in accordance with all applicable Cook Islands \nanticorruption laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date); and (b) a project website is developed within 2 months of loan \neffectiveness, and maintained to disclose the audited project financial accounts, \nproject progress and procurement activities. \n(xi)  Grievance  and  redress  mechanism.  The  Government  shall  establish  a \ncomplaint and problem management mechanism under Ministry of Finance and \nEconomic  Management  to  (a)  review  and  address  grievances  of  project \nstakeholders, in relation to either the Project, any of the service providers, or any \nperson responsible for carrying out the Project; and (b) set the threshold criteria \n ", "19 \nand procedures for handling such grievances, for proactively responding to them, \nand for providing the stakeholders with notice of the chosen mechanism/action \n(xii)  Financial  performance.  CIPA will take all necessary action to achieve and \nmaintain (a) an operating profit of not less than 2% to be earned on average net \nrevalued fixed assets in service. \n \n(xiii)  Community service obligations.

Port Infrastructure and Institutions \n \n1.  The Cook Islands port infrastructure comprises two international ports\u2014at Avatiu near \nthe main town of Avarua on Rarotonga and at Aitutaki\u2014plus small domestic port and jetty \nfacilities on each of the 13 outer islands and that handle interisland traffic only. Avatiu port \nhandles  about  90%  of  total  imports  by  sea,  and  Aitutaki  the  balance.  International  cargo \ndestined for the outer islands is transshipped at Avatiu. International exports by sea (largely \ncomprised of fish) are minor. The ports at Avatiu and Aitutaki are operated by the Cook Islands \nPorts Authority (CIPA), and the outer island ports are under the jurisdiction of the Office of the \nMinister of Island Administration (OMIA) and the individual island administrations. OMIA is a \ngovernment department granted an annual budget allocation by the Crown to provide essential \nservices to the outer islands, including transportation, energy, and water. \n \n2.  CIPA is a Crown-owned statutory corporation established by Parliament under the Ports \nAuthority  Act  1995  to  provide  commercially  viable  port  facilities  and  develop  growth \nopportunities  from  the  port  assets,  which  include  Crown  land  and  buildings,  wharves  and \nmarina, port facilities, tugboats, plant and equipment, storage sheds, and hardstand areas. \nCIPA levies ports charges at both Rarotonga and Aitutaki. The new marina constructed at \nAvatiu Harbor under the Cyclone Recovery Reconstruction Program also began to provide \nrevenue to CIPA in 2008. The Cook Islands Investment Corporation (CIIC) presently collects the \nrent on land within the port area that is occupied by a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) company \nand several food concessions. CIIC has agreed that these rents and any rentals from future \nconcessions on port-controlled land are to be transferred to the CIPA accounts. No fees are \nlevied by OMIA to users of outer island ports facilities. \n \nB.  Port Trade \n \n1.  Avatiu Port \n \n3.  Throughputs of dry cargoes and fuel at Avatiu in the past 5 years are shown in Figures \nA2.1 and A2.2. Dry goods (containers, vehicles, break-bulk, and bulk items such as cement, \ntimber, and other building materials) are serviced by two vessels. These are operated by Reef \nShipping and the Pacific Forum Line, alternating on an approximately 21-day rotation (i.e., a \nship off-loads at Avatiu about every 10 days). All ships loading or unloading cargo at Avatiu \nmust  be  self-supporting  with  onboard  cranes  or  derricks.  The  port  operates  only  forklifts. \nApproximately 76% of the 68,000 tons imported in FY2007 was in containers. Although the two \nships are of similar capacity (86\u201389 meters [m] in length, 6\u20137 m draft, about 2,700 gross \nregistered tons, and capacity of about 250 twenty-foot equivalent containers), the Reef Shipping \nvessel carries about 70% of the total dry cargo. \n \n4.  Liquid bulk cargoes consist of automotive diesel, unleaded gasoline, jet A1 air fuel, and \nLPG. The liquid fuels are sourced from two international fuel suppliers (BP and ExxonMobil), \nwhile there is a single supplier for LPG imports (Origin Energy). In tonnage, LPG accounts for \n3%\u20135% of total fuel imports. The liquid fuels are offloaded in bulk at the wharf from vessels of \n72\u201390 m chartered by three competing onshore fuel distributors and are pumped into a pipeline \nshared by the distributors under a leasing arrangement. The pipeline connects the wharf to their \nrespective fuel storage facilities. LPG is delivered in tanker containers from vessels of 76\u201386 m \nand transferred to bulk LPG storage adjacent to the cargo storage area at the wharf. There is \ncurrently no physical separation or barrier between the LPG storage facility and the general \n ", "Appendix 2  23 \ncargo area, but the Government is considering to move the LPG facility to another location for \nsafety reasons. Liquid fuels are delivered to Rarotonga about once a month and LPG about \nonce every 2 months. \n5.  Vessels that use the wharf most frequently are local fishing vessels, averaging 5\u20137 calls \nper week with stays of a week or more, plus private yachts and tour boats. This small boat traffic \ncauses some congestion in the harbor at busy periods, although calls by local and foreign \nfishing vessels have fallen considerably since 2004 due to poor fishing conditions. There is a \nsingle small local interisland shipping vessel. It carries transshipped international containers, \nfuel, and bulk cargoes to the outer islands on an irregular schedule. \nFigure A2.1: Dry Goods Imports Through Avatiu\n100,000\nBuilding\n90,000\nMaterial\n80,000 Cement\n70,000\nTimber\n60,000\nBreak Bulk\ns\non 50,000\nT\nVehicles\n40,000\n30,000 Container\nCargo\n20,000\n10,000\n-\n2002\u20132003 2003\u20132004 2004\u20132005 2005\u20132006 2006\u20132007 2007\u20132008\nSource: Cook Islands Ports Authority.\n \n \nFigure A2.2: Fuel Imports Through Avatiu\n25,000\n20,000\nLPG \n(tons)\n15,000 Jet A1 \ns (tons)\nn\no\nT Mogas \n10,000 (tons)\nADO \n(tons)\n5,000\n-\n2002\u20132003 2003\u20132004 2004\u20132005 2005\u20132006 2006\u20132007 2007\u20132008\nADO = automotive diesel, LPG = liquefied petroleum gas, MOGAS = motor gasoline.\nSource: Cook Islands Ports Authority.\n \n \n ", "24  Appendix 2 \n6.  Growth in dry cargo and fuel imports was dampened by the cyclones of 2005 and the \ngeneral  downturn  in  world  economic  conditions  since  2007.  However,  there  has  been  a \nsignificant upturn in cargo volumes in the current fiscal year. Cargo volumes are strongly \ninfluenced by short- and long-term changes in the tourism sector, which also influence food \nconsumption, other retail activity, capital goods imports, fuel use, and construction of tourism \nfacilities. As illustrated in Figure A2.3, there was strong growth in tourism from Europe and \nAustralia between 1998 and 2000, in addition to growth from New Zealand. Since 2000, almost \nall growth in tourist arrivals has been from New Zealand (a significant proportion of which is \nrepresented by Cook Islanders, with a markedly lesser impact on tourism income) while other \ntourist  markets  have  been  stagnant  or  declining.  There  is,  however,  strong  potential  for \nresumption of growth in the non-New Zealand markets\u2014especially from North America and \nAsia\u2014and hence for strong growth in tourism-related imports. \n \n7.  Tourism also creates direct demand for services at the port, due to increasing arrivals of \nyachts and pleasure boats and, especially, passenger cruise ships. Calls by yachts rose from \n113 in 2003 to 137 in 2007. Thirty-seven cruise ships visited Rarotonga in 2007 (54% more than \nin 2003), but very few of them have been able to berth within Avatiu Harbor. Most cruise ships \npresently anchor off the reef and bring passengers ashore by tender for day excursions. Once \nthe port project is completed, it is expected that at least 25 cruise ships will be able to berth at \nthe wharf, and cruise ship passengers will thus contribute more spending and income to the \nCook Islands economy. \n \n8.  Based  on  comments  from  international  shippers  and  retailers  in  Rarotonga,  it  is \nanticipated that the current level of import volumes is likely to continue for another 2 years (to \n2010) then establish a long-term growth pattern of approximately 2.5% in real terms per year. \nThis  estimate  coincides  (conservatively)  with  expectations  in  the  National  Sustainable \nDevelopment Plan1 and of New Zealand Agency for International Development2 for 3.5% long-\nterm real annual growth in the Cook Islands economy. \n \n                                                 \n1  Government of Cook Islands. 2007.

Aitutaki Imports \n \n9.  Reef  Shipping  provides  a  regular  monthly  service  delivering  an  average  of  40 \ncontainers, which require 2 days to unload. Mataroa International used to provide a monthly \nservice with break-bulk cargo. Total revenue tonnages shipped through Aitutaki vary between \n10,000 and 15,000 tons, or roughly 10% of the tonnages through Avatiu. There has been an \nincreasing trend toward containers in place of break-bulk cargo. \n \n  3.  Outer Islands Cargo \n \n10.  Dry cargo and fuel to the other outer islands are transshipped from Avatiu by a single \ninterisland trader vessel, which operates infrequently and irregularly with small volumes. No \ncargo tonnage figures are available. \n \nC.  Problems and Constraints \n \n1.  Avatiu Port \n \n11.  The existing wharf structure has deteriorated due to a number of factors, including the \nuse of reinforced concrete sheet piles, many of which are cracked and broken due to hard \ndriving during construction, corrosion of steel anchor ties, spalling of the concrete cope beam \ndue to corrosion of reinforcement and exacerbated by berthing vessels impacting the quay. \n \n12.  Secondary effects caused by these factors have contributed to the loss of fill material \nfrom behind the face of the quay wall and the cracking of pavement slabs on the wharf. Due to \nthe problems encountered with the design of the existing wharf, and particularly the use of \n ", "26  Appendix 2 \nconcrete sheet piles, this construction method should not be considered for the replacement \nquay wall. Table 2.1 lists the deficiencies and risks of inaction. \n \nTable A2.1: Defects and Risks to Avatiu Wharf Structure \nCondition  Consequence  Risk  Mitigation \nCope beam with extensive concrete  Compromised beam continuity to  High  Repair or replace \nspalling and corrosion of reinforcement   spread mooring and berthing forces  beam \nConcrete sheet piling\u2014gaps between  Loss of fill material forming voids in  Ongoing  Repair cracking, \npiles, cracked and broken piles  reclamation  replace wall, and \nfill voids \nReinforcement projecting from the wall  Damage to vessels and wall  High  Remove \nprotrusions \nShort piles not reaching design  Overstressing of wall  Ongoing  Replace wall \npenetration levels \nInadequate fenders   Damage to fenders, cope beam,  High  Upgrade fenders \nand vessels \nBollards in poor condition and of limited  Overloading of bollards and  Moderate  Upgrade bollards \ncapacity  overstressing and failure of cope  and quay wall \nbeam \nReduced draft adjacent to the quay face  Damage to vessels  Moderate  Remove \ndue to base concrete repairs and debris  obstructions \nCorrosion of the wall anchorage system\u2019s  Failure of anchorage and  Moderate  Replace or repair \nsteel ties   overstressing of adjacent  anchors \nanchorages \nCracked concrete pavement   Accelerated deterioration of  Moderate  Replace \npavement due to heavy vehicles  pavement \nVoids under slabs  Collapse of pavement particularly  High to  Either restrict \nunder loaded container handling  Moderate  vehicle loads, or \nequipment  repair wall, \nbackfill, and \nreinstate \npavement \nNarrow entrance channel  Grounding of vessels  Moderate  Remove \nobstructions \nInsufficient maneuvering area within  Damage to vessels and structures  Moderate  Either increase \nharbor    maneuvering \nGrounding of vessels  area or restrict \nvessel size \nLack of channel entrance navigation aids  Damage or grounding of vessels  Moderate  Install navigation \naids \n   Source: ADB surveys. \n \n13.  Alternative quay structures have been considered for the international wharf as part of \nthe study. The main design parameters for the wharf structure to be taken account of are the \nfollowing: \n(i)  an  \u201calongside\u201d  dredge  depth  to  8.0  meters  below  chart  datum  (capable  of \naccommodating vessels with drafts on the order of 7.0 to 7.5 meters), \n(ii)  safely mooring vessels up to 6,000 deadweight tons, \n(iii)  fender  systems  with  an  energy  absorption  capacity  for  vessels  up  to  6,000 \ndeadweight tons, \n ", "Appendix 2  27 \n(iv)  quay loading from 40 foot containers and forklift wheel loads induced when lifting \nthe containers, and \n(v)  designed to international standards (AS4997/BS6345). \n \n14.  In consideration of the above general parameters, three alternative structural forms have \nbeen considered: \n(i)  steel sheet piles with anchor ties, \n(ii)  steel sheet or tubular piles cantilevered from the seabed, and \n(iii)  gravity quay wall of precast and unreinforced concrete blocks. \n \n15.  An assessment of the alternatives is given in Table A2.2. The least-cost option of steel \nsheet piles with anchor ties has been adopted for the Project\u2019s preliminary design concept. \n \nTable A2.2: Comparison of Alternatives for Avatiu Wharf Reconstruction \nOption  Description  Advantages  Disadvantages  Relative Cost \nAnchored Sheet  Steel  sheet  pile  (cid:121) Requires less steelwork  (cid:121) Susceptible to  1.00 \nPile Wall  sections driven into  than cantilever option  corrosion, particularly of \nthe seabed and the  (cid:121) Lighter construction  tie-rod components \ntop of the wall tied \nequipment required  (cid:121) Tie-rod vulnerable to \nback  to  a  buried \ncompared with  overstressing due to \nanchor  wall  using \ncantilever option  reclamation settlement \nsteel anchor rods \n(cid:121) Design and construction  (cid:121) Limitations to laying \nmethod previously  services in the apron \nundertaken in  area immediately \nRarotonga (including  behind the quay wall \nCIPA marina currently \nunder construction) \nCantilever Sheet  Heavy-duty sheet  (cid:121) Does not require anchor  (cid:121) Subject to corrosion but  1.16 \nPile Wall  pile and/or tubular  rods and wall  generally more robust \nsteel sections  (cid:121) Apron area free for  components \ncantilevered from \nlaying services  (cid:121) Relatively more \nthe seabed \nsteelwork required \n(cid:121) Heavier equipment \nrequired to handle and \ndrive piles \nConcrete Block  Mass concrete  (cid:121) Uses mainly local  (cid:121) Requires additional  1.24 \nGravity Wall  precast blocks built  materials (no  excavation to form base \nup in layers to form  reinforcement required  (cid:121) Stability dependant on \na gravity wall.  except for capping  underlying geotechnical \nbeam)  conditions \n(cid:121) Less heavy equipment  (cid:121) Relatively more difficult \nrequired for construction for future deepening of \n(cid:121) Low maintenance  berth below design level \n(\u20138.0 meter chart \ndatum) \n   Note: Relative costs are for the total project cost. \n   Source: ADB estimates. \n \n2.  Aitutaki \n \n15.  Aitutaki Harbor comprises the Arutanga Channel leading to a small basin and finger \nquay. Ships cannot berth at the quay because of the channel depth (maximum less than 2 m at \nhigh tide) and restricted basin space. CIPA has a lighter operation using two old barges, each of \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \nwhich can transport one full twenty-foot equivalent unit and up to three empty containers. The \nport operates two mobile cranes with 18\u201320 tons capacity each and two forklifts with 3.5-ton and \n6-ton capacity, respectively. Aitutaki Harbor\u2019s main quay has a hardstand area adequate for two \nbarges and a 20-ton mobile crane. \n \n16.  The port facilities are very basic, comprising two quays at right angles, an L-shaped \nstorage area behind the quays, and an additional unpaved storage area south of the quay. The \nquay is in need of repairs and pavements are broken and uneven. The only channel navigation \naid is a transit, but there are no channel marker buoys. There is limited storage in the CIPA \ngarage,  where  its  cranes  and  forklifts  are  stored  and  maintained.  Containers  are  either \ntransported to shippers\u2019 premises or unpacked in the open behind a temporary fence. \n \n17.  CIPA is carrying out needed repairs to the quay walls and hardstand area, and it has \nordered a new 22 m barge capable of carrying two twenty-foot equivalent units and a new 25-\nton forklift. This will provide sufficient cargo handling capacity for the foreseeable future. CIPA \nproposes to develop the harbor in stages, progressively deepening the Arutanga Channel and \nenlarging the basin. \n \n3.  Outer Islands \n \n18.  The harbors in the outer islands typically comprise a channel cut through the reef flat to \na small basin containing a dock area and small boat ramp. Some harbors have concrete \nseawalls to provide a measure of protection to the channel and basin. Typically, the dock area \ncomprises a concrete paved quay and a small hardstand area. Each island has one or more \nbarges or large dinghies for transferring cargoes from the ship and which are unloaded onto the \nquay by truck with hydraulic arm owned by the island administration. Pallets are then moved to \na nearby storage shed. \n \n19.  Penhryn has the only harbor (Omoka) in the outer islands that is directly accessible by \nship. It and the airport were constructed by the US military during the Second World War. Ships \nenter the lagoon through a passage north of Moananui and are able to berth alongside the quay \nand unload cargo directly onto the quay pavement. The dock area also contains fuel storage \ntanks for the Cook Islands patrol boat, Te Kukupa. \n \n20.  The smaller islands have very basic infrastructure: Pukapuka has a narrow, shallow \nchannel cut through the reef into the lagoon. Cargoes are unloaded from the barge at a beach \n(Yato) in front of the storage shed. Nassau has no harbor, and cargoes are ferried by boat to the \nreef edge and trucked across the reef flat at low tide. Palmerston has a shallow channel in the \nreef but no quay and cargoes are unloaded on the beach. \n \n21.  Manihiki, Penhryn, and Pukapuka also have small boat wharfs inside the lagoon at each \nvillage for serving the barges or dinghies transferring cargoes and fuel from the main harbor to \nthe separate villages. \n \n22.  A  needs  assessment  for  the  outer  island  harbors  carried  out  under  the  Cyclone \nRecovery Reconstruction Plan3 made the following recommendations that have been accepted \nby the island councils. For Atiu, Mangaia, Manihiki, Mauke, Mitiaro, and Rakahanga harbors, \nsome or all of the following works are required: (i) remove encroaching reef and improve the \n                                                 \n3  Cook  Islands  Government,  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economic  Management.  2006.

Rarotonga. \n ", "Appendix 2  29 \nchannel to a uniform 3 m depth, (ii) enlarge the basin and construct a new 25 m quay and 15 m \nwide small boat ramp close to the shoreline to improve basin protection, (iii) construct or extend \nthe breakwater to protect channel and basin, (iv) construct a seawall to protect channel and \nbasin, (v) install new bollards and fendering to quay line wall, (vi) install additional beacon light \nand reflector channel markers on the seawall ends, and (vii) construct a concrete landing ramp \nto enable loading barge access. \n \n23.  Upgrading of the Mangaia, Mauke, and Mitiaro harbors will be undertaken under grant \nfinancing from New Zealand\u2019s International Aid and Development Agency. Design and tendering \nis expected to be completed in FY2009. \n \n24.  For Penhryn Harbor, recommendations include the following: (i) replace entire sheet \npiling with concrete wall anchored by geotextile mesh, (ii) construct gabion walls to protect \nharbor walls north and south of the main quays, (iii) repair or replace quay pavements, (iv) \nreplace bollards and install new fendering, (v) dredge berth area and shipping channel, and (vi) \nprovide navigation markers in main shipping channel. \n \n25.  Pukapuka  Harbor  requires  construction  of  a  concrete  jetty,  boat  ramp,  and  small \nhardstand  area  at  Yato.  A  second  small  jetty  is  needed  on  Motu  Ko  for  transferring  air \npassengers, cargo, and fuel. The boat passage across the reef flat needs to be cleared and \nimproved and channel markers installed. \n \n26.  Nassau requires construction of a small harbor, including to (i) excavate a channel and \nsmall basin; (ii) construct concrete quay or jetty on the foreshore; (iii) install channel markers, \nbollards, and fendering; and (iv) reconstruct and widen the concrete causeway to the beach \nridge. The Government plans to undertake this work during FY2009. \n \nD.  Institutional Capacity and Governance Issues \n \n27.  CIPA is a commercial statutory authority, charging commercial rates for services and \npaying  taxes  and,  upon  improving  profitability,  dividends  to  the  Government.  Financial \nperformance for the 5 years to 2007 has been poor, however, due to weak management and \ndeteriorating asset performance. Operations of the Aitutaki port have never been profitable and \nhave  been  cross-subsidized  by  the  Rarotonga  port  operations.  Top  management  at  CIPA \nchanged in late 2007, and the Project will address the asset performance issues in Rarotonga. \nAs a result, it may be confidently expected that CIPA\u2019s financial performance will markedly \nimprove in the near and intermediate terms (Supplementary Appendix A). \n \n28.  Financial  management  at  CIPA  is  good,  although  it  currently  has  no  qualified \naccountant.  Financial  reporting  is  clear  and  based  on  externally  audited  accounts.  Cross-\nsubsidies,  which  include  the  costs  of  operating  and  maintaining  the  Aitutaki  port  and \naccommodating interisland shipping, the Cook Islands Maritime Surveillance, and local fishing \noperations,  are  readily  identifiable  and  can  be  isolated  and  potentially  incorporated  into  a \ntransparent community service obligation subsidy agreement (or payment in lieu of dividend) \nwith the Government. (The financial separation of Aitutaki port operations from those of Avatiu \nHarbor will enable transparent quantification of the Aitutaki port operations and maintenance \ncosts  so  that  they  may  be  addressed  in  the  subsidy  agreement,  lowering  costs  to  the \nGovernment as CIPA\u2019s finance health improves.) \n \n29.  Port operations are efficient and are carried out safely, with a high level of technical \nexpertise evident. With a total staff strength of 25 and only 5 in senior management and \n ", "30  Appendix 2 \ntechnical positions, however, CIPA is vulnerable to capacity loss through staff turnover. CIPA \nlacks  an  asset  management  capability,  as  there  is  only  one  wharf  hand  looking  after \nmaintenance and without the requisite qualifications to implement an asset management plan or \nto program forward-looking preventative maintenance operations on equipment or infrastructure. \nCIPA\u2019s maintenance of equipment and of the wharf structure and buildings has historically not \nbeen adequate. \n \n30.  The  needs  for  staff  additions  include  (i)  a  qualified  accountant  to  accommodate \nincreasingly complex financial operations and reporting as the port grows and increases its \ncommercial focus, and (ii) a competent technical officer to exercise tighter control and better \nplanning of maintenance functions. \n \n31.  CIPA has to date not been able to maximize the income potential of the port land under \nits control. It lacks incentives to do so, as CIPA has no formal legal instrument over the land with \nthe right to secure commercial rents, apart from those from the Ministry of Transport office \nbuilding and cargo storage areas. Transfer of these rights under a lease to CIPA from CIIC over \nthe port and harbor limits will significantly strengthen CIPA\u2019s financial performance and provide \nmanagement with the appropriate commercial incentives to maximize such performance. \n \n32.  CIPA is currently a self-regulating public corporation. Its technical performance has been \ninadequately monitored in the past, however, resulting in the port assets\u2019 present advanced \nstate of disrepair. Infrastructure management (all sectors, including transportation) in the Cook \nIslands is presently under intense Government scrutiny, and, with assistance from ADB, a new \nand strengthened institutional framework to support infrastructure investment and maintenance \nwill be implemented over the next 4 years.  \n ", "Appendix 3  31 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE PORT AND MARITIME SECTOR \n \nTable A3.1: Asian Development Bank \nA.

Introduction \n \n1.  The country is well-served by international shipping through the port at Avatiu. The import \nof dry goods (containers, vehicles, break-bulk, and bulk items such as cement, timber, and other \nbuilding materials) is serviced by two vessels alternating on an approximately 21-day rotation (i.e., \na ship off-loads at Avatiu approximately every 10 days). Approximately 76% of the 68,000 tons \nimported in FY2007 was in containers. Petroleum imports, all of which pass through Avatiu Harbor, \nconsist of three liquid fuels (automotive diesel, unleaded petrol, and jet A1) and liquid petroleum \ngas (LPG). Liquid fuels are delivered to Rarotonga about once a month and LPG about once every \n2 months. \n \n2.  International  passenger  cruise  vessels  of  300\u2013650  passenger  capacity  and  up  to  200 \nmeters (m) call at Avatiu Harbor more than twice a month. Only the smallest of these berth at the \nwharf, and then only rarely. Most cruise ships anchor off the reef and bring passengers ashore by \ntender for day excursions. Vessels using the wharf most frequently are local fishing vessels, \naveraging 5\u20137 calls per week with stays of a week or more, plus private yachts and tour boats. \nThere is often considerable congestion in the harbor on account of these vessels (though calls by \nlocal  and  foreign  fishing  vessels  have  fallen  considerably  since  2004  due  to  poor  fishing \nconditions). There is a single small local interisland shipping vessel that transships containers, fuel, \nand bulk cargoes to the outer islands on an irregular schedule. \n \n3.  The tonnage of dry good imports grew in FY2004 over the previous year by 19%, flattened \nout or declined until FY2007 in the wake of the cyclones of 2005, then resumed strong growth in \nFY2008. A similar pattern characterizes petroleum imports over the period (Appendix 2). \n \n4.  The wharf upgrade project will provide (i) extended port life to handle the country\u2019s trade \nactivity reliably and safely for a further 30 years; and (ii) increased capacity to maintain efficiency \nand accommodate changes toward larger ships that are occurring in the international shipping \nindustry, as discussed briefly below. \n \n5.  The  current  wharf  structure  at  Avatiu  was  designed  and  constructed  in  1989.  During \nconstruction, difficulties were encountered in driving concrete piles at the wharf face and the \ncompleted structure did not meet design specifications. In the period since, the structural integrity \nof the wharf has been steadily weakened by wave action and erosion, thus requiring periodic \nrestoration work, and there is advanced corrosion of the steel works. The wharf has a very limited \nlife, and remedial works are urgently needed. The wharf also has an angle in the middle (about 120 \nm from the harbor entrance) that prevents long vessels from turning. The harbor itself also has \nlimitations, with an uneven depth of about 6\u20137 m below chart datum, a narrow turning basin (about \n120 m, effective), and a narrow harbor entrance (about 100 m). The international tanker and cargo \nvessels that currently use the harbor\u2014typically 86\u201390 m long\u2014are the maximum size that can be \nhandled by the port. \n \n6.  The port presently fails to meet international standards for the safe operation of container \nand  fuel  tanker  vessels.  Issues  include,  among  others,  inadequate  slip  clearance  distances \nbetween vessels and permanent structures and ground contours, insufficient working load capacity \nof the mooring bollards due to weaknesses in the wharf structure, an inadequate fendering system, \nand considerable debris and concrete rubble below the waterline and on the harbor floor that \ndamage the hulls of large vessels. Without rehabilitation, the port\u2019s capacity to handle even the \npresent  volumes  of  fuel  and  cargo  imports  will  require  rapidly  increasing  expenditures  for \nemergency repairs, with increased risks of damage to vessels. \n ", "Appendix 8  43 \n7.  Future trends affecting the international shipping industry point to a movement toward \nlarger vessels (up to 120 m length and 6,000 deadweight tons in comparison with current vessels \nof  up  to  90  m  length  and  4,000  deadweight  tons).  There  is  compelling  evidence  that  the \ninternational shipping industry is subject to mergers and a shift to larger vessels. A new vessel \nbeing planned to replace the primary vessel currently delivering cargo to the Cook Islands would \nbe about 114 m in length with a 7 m draft, and it would be capable of carrying bulk fuel in addition \nto containers and break bulk. The new vessel would burn heavy fuel oil, at considerable savings in \ncomparison with the light distillate fuel that is used by the current cargo vessels. Shippers have \ncited lower delivery costs resulting from the capacity to combine fuel and dry goods deliveries. \n \n8.  The port at Avatiu Harbor handles about 90% of the cargo that comes into the Cook \nIslands. There are no other port facilities anywhere in the country that could provide similar \nservices as an alternative to Avatiu. Alternatives to upgrading the Avatiu port would therefore entail \nconstructing  new  port  facilities  at  another  location  in  Rarotonga  (where  70%  of  the  national \npopulation  lives).  Constructing  a  new  port  in  Rarotonga  would  be  very  substantially  more \nexpensive than upgrading the existing port, and it would entail additional considerable social and \nenvironmental costs.  \n \n9.  Within  the  Avatiu  Harbor,  alternative  designs  have  been  considered  during  project \npreparation, including different alignments of the wharf structure, various configurations for the \nwestern reaches of the ships\u2019 turning basin, and different materials for the wharf structure (in \nparticular) the wharf face and piling. The proposed port upgrade design has been determined to be \nthe least costly of the available alternatives that meet acceptable technical standards and result in \nextending the port life to 30 years. \n \n10.  The economic evaluation of the Project was carried out by comparing with-project and \nwithout-project scenarios. The assessment covers 2009\u20132041, on the assumption that construction \nwill extend over a period of 2.5 years starting in the second half of 2009. All benefits and costs are \nin constant 2008 prices. \n \nB.  Economic Costs \n \n11.  Project economic costs include site works, quay structure works, bollards, fenders, navaids, \ndredging and blasting costs, costs of environmental mitigation, consulting services, and security \nfencing. There are no land costs and resettlement costs are minor. Taxes and duties are excluded \nfrom the economic assessment. \n \n12.  The local currency in the Cook Islands is the New Zealand dollar. There are no levies or \nduties on imported materials. A value added tax of 12.5% is assessed on all goods and services. \nAs Cook Islanders carry New Zealand passports and have free rights to migrate and work and \nclaim social benefits in New Zealand, there is virtually no unemployment in Rarotonga and wage \nrates are an accurate measure of the opportunity cost of labor. Under these circumstances, it is \nestimated that the shadow wage rate and exchange rate factors necessary to equilibrate the \nborder and domestic price levels of traded and nontraded goods in the Cook Islands are not \nmaterially different from 1.0. \n \nC.  Economic Benefits \n \n13.  Without the Project, the port facility at Avatiu would become unreliable and subject to \nfrequent disruptions. The port infrastructure would continue to deteriorate and weaken, requiring \nfrequent and costly fixes. As problems appear, shippers and their insurers will refuse to allow their \nships  to  enter  the  port  without  the  fixes  being  done  to  their  satisfaction.  Short  of  general \n ", "44  Appendix 8 \n \nrefurbishment of the wharf infrastructure similar to that envisaged under the Project, however, the \nfixes will not extend the life of the port and continued fixes through time at increasing cost would be \nnecessary. As the harbor continues to deteriorate in the long term, imports may have to be \ndelivered on small chartered vessels, which would drive up import costs. \n \n14.  Initial repairs to the port that, without the Project, are urgently required to strengthen the tie-\nback in the wharf face and to shore up bollards, clear underwater debris, etc., are estimated to cost \napproximately NZ$3 million. These repairs, assumed to be carried out one-off within the next 2 \nyears without the Project, would not address the deep structural flaws in the wharf infrastructure, \nsuch as the existing gaps in the wharf face that allow seawater to intrude under the wharf deck, \ncreating voids and removing support from the wharf deck above. Without the Project, therefore, the \nvoids would continue to increase and wharf deck failures to become more and more common, \nrequiring increasingly frequent emergency fixes. In addition, the real costs of cargo delivery and of \nin-port services would rise over time, as the port infrastructure deteriorated, the delivery vessels \ncurrently in service were retired but not replaced by commercial shippers due to the poor condition \nof the port, forcing the Government to charter small vessels with high insurance and operating \ncosts. \n \n15.  With the Project, cargo and fuel import volumes are assumed to increase at a long-term \naverage annual rate of 2.5% (see the sector analysis in Appendix 2 for further discussion). As \ndiscussed in Appendix 2, there is a direct and strong correlation between cargo volume and the \nCook Islands\u2019 economic development (i.e., cargo volumes at the port will grow in parallel with the \ngeneral GDP growth rate).1 The Ministry of Finance and Economic Management has affirmed that \nthe country remains on target to meet the Government\u2019s projected sustained real annual economic \ngrowth of 3.5% per year. To be conservative, the analysis has adopted a growth in volumes, and \nhence port revenues, of 2.5% per annum. Without the Project, it is assumed that the present \nvolume of dry goods and fuel deliveries would remain constant in the future as such volumes would \nbe prevented from declining due to the frequent port fixes carried out under the without-project \nscenario. \n \n16.  Further, the harbor is presently too small for current and future vessels, and it is becoming \nincreasingly difficult for commercial ships to maneuver in the harbor with safe clearances from \npermanent structures and other vessels. The Project will improve safety while allowing a higher \nlevel of shipping activity with lower per-unit delivery costs than would otherwise be possible.  \n \n17.  Containerized cargo is currently delivered at Avatiu by 4,000-ton vessels (85\u201390 m length \noverall) burning light distillate fuel. New vessels likely to come on line in the next 3\u20135 years, \ncapable of carrying both cargo and fuel for delivery, will be of the 6,000-ton class (up to 120 m \nlength overall), will travel about 50% faster than the vessels that they replace (and thus will burn \nless fuel per ton-mile), and will burn heavy fuel oil (a substantially cheaper fuel). The Project will \nenable such vessels to make deliveries to the Cook Islands and thus will help to stabilize and \nreduce  cargo  delivery  costs  even  in  the  face  of  sustained  high  international  fuel  prices. \n(Irrespective of the actual path of fuel prices in the future, the price spread between heavy fuel oil \nand light distillate fuel is likely to remain substantial.) A comparison of vessel operating costs \n(slower 4,000-ton vessel burning distillate fuel versus faster 6,000-ton vessel burning heavy fuel \noil) suggests that the savings in dry goods cargo delivery costs will be on the order of 10%. This is \na highly conservative assumption, as it does not take into account rising costs, under the without-\nproject scenario, of freight arriving on small, chartered vessels at increasing risk and incidence of \ndamage from the unimproved wharf, as well as the attendant rising costs of vessel insurance. Even \n                                                 \n1  The elasticity of imports (i.e., the ratio of the percentage change in import volumes to a given percentage change in \nreal GDP) is estimated at 1.29 for the period 2002\u20132007. \n ", "Appendix 8  45 \nif smaller (85\u201390 m) vessels remain in service to the Cook Islands for the immediate- and medium-\nterm future, the Project will ensure that commercially operated vessels will continue to deliver \ncargo to the Cook Islands and that vessel chartering and self-insurance by Government\u2014at much \nhigher costs than commercial rates\u2014will be avoided. \n \n18.  Fuel delivery costs savings under the Project are also likely, given that the future 6,000-ton \nships will be capable of delivering fuel in combination with dry goods. A shipping company that \nplans to invest in a 6,000-ton vessel to replace the 4,000-ton vessel currently in service claims that \ndelivery costs for fuel will fall by NZ$0.10 per liter because of this capability. However, potential fuel \ndelivery cost savings may also result from upstream fuel market rationalization (e.g., regional \nprocurement arrangements or sharing of capacity by competing fuel suppliers) that may or may not \ndepend on port development. In light of this, it is assumed that fuel delivery cost savings of about \nNZ$0.02/liter will occur under the with-project scenario in comparison with the without-project \nscenario. \n \n19.  Under the with-project scenario, passenger cruise ships will be able to berth at the port in \nmuch higher numbers than under the without-project scenario. Presently, cruise ships call at \nRarotonga approximately 35 times per year (Appendix 2) but very rarely berth at the port. Instead, \ncruise ships anchor off shore and tourist passengers that wish to do so disembark for a day\u2019s visit \nin Rarotonga by ship\u2019s tender. Records indicate that only some 40% of a cruise ship\u2019s passengers \nchoose to come ashore under these circumstances but that well more than 90% disembark if the \ncruise ship is berthed at port. Average expenditure by a cruise ship passenger in Rarotonga during \nsuch a visit for 1 day is estimated at NZ$100,2 resulting in additional income in the economy of \nsome NZ$50/passenger/day. Under present circumstances and under the without-project scenario, \nan opportunity for income from tourism is lost by the inability to berth cruise ships in the port. Under \nthe with-project scenario, it is assumed that 25 cruise ships will berth at the port annually and that \nan average of 90% of passengers will disembark for a day\u2019s visit in Rarotonga during such calls. \n \nD.  Results of the Economic Assessment and Sensitivity Analysis \n \n20.  At a 12% discount rate, the Project is found to be economically viable. The net present \nvalue (NPV) is NZ$5.5 million and the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 15.9%. The most \nimportant benefits are found to be generated by the Project through dry goods cargo delivery cost \nsavings made possible by the post-project capacity to handle larger cargo ships and the avoided \ncost of frequent emergency port repairs. Relatively minor additional benefits accrue from fuel \ndelivery cost savings and additional tourist expenditure. \n \n21.  The  estimates  of  the  benefits  made  possible  by  the  Project  are  considered  to  be \nconservative, because the economic evaluation does not fully quantify the likely rises in freight \ncharges (including insurance charges) associated with reliance on small chartered vessels under \nthe without-project scenario, nor does it take into account benefits to consumers (i.e., additional \nconsumer surplus) provided by a sustained higher level of imports in comparison with the without-\nproject scenario. The actual benefit from the Project could substantially exceed the estimates \npresented. \n \n22.  The base case EIRR calculation is presented in the table below. \n \n                                                 \n2  Cook Islands Tourism Corporation estimate. Purchases of tourists on day-visits to Rarotonga, as would be the case in \nrespect of cruise ships berthing at Avatiu, are assumed to be concentrated in such goods and services as restaurant \nmeals, jewelry, car hire, and souvenirs, all of which have profit margins well in excess of 50%. \n \n ", "46  Appendix 8 \n \nTable A8.1: Economic Internal Rate of Return  \n(Constant 2008 NZ$ million) \n                   \n  Economic Costs  Efficiency Benefits     \nTotal Incr.

The EIRR calculation was subjected to sensitivity analysis to test the effects of negative \nchanges in the key parameters that determine the benefits and costs of the Project. The sensitivity \nanalysis found that the Project remains economically viable in the face of a 20% increase in costs \nor a 20% decrease in all benefits. In the worst-case scenario\u2014a combination of costs increased by \n20% and all benefits decreased by 20%\u2014the NPV becomes negative at a discount rate of 12% \nand the EIRR falls to 10.5%.

Overall, the Project is most sensitive to increases in capital costs, as indicated by the \nsensitivity indicator (SI) of 2.89 (indicating, for example, that if costs increase by 10%, the NPV of \nthe project will decrease by 28.9%). On the benefits side, the Project is most sensitive to a \ndecrease in dry goods delivery cost savings (SI=2.1). The switching values in the above table show \nthe percentage increase in a cost variable or decline in a benefit variable required for the NPV to \nbecome zero, which is the same as the EIRR\u2019s falling to the cutoff level of 12%. \n \nE.  Distribution Analysis \n \n25.  A distribution analysis has been carried out for the Project, based on the above results and \nthe financial analysis presented in Appendix 9. At a 12% economic discount rate applied to the \ncosts and benefits streams in both analyses, the net present value (NPV) of the economic net \nbenefits of the Project to the country as a whole is NZ$5.46 million, whereas the NPV of the \nfinancial benefits (FNPV) of the Project to the Cook Islands Port Authority (CIPA) is \u2013NZ$8.28 \nmillion, a difference of NZ$13.74 million. The equalizing discount rate under the economic analysis \nis 15.9%, exceeding the economic opportunity cost of capital of 12%. The equalizing discount rate \nunder the financial analysis is 6.0%, exceeding the weighted average cost of capital\u2014the real \ninterest rate facing CIPA\u2014of 1.23%. Thus, the Project is both economically and financially viable. \nIn  particular,  port  charges  as  projected  under  the  analysis  of  CIPA\u2019s  financial  performance \n(Supplementary Appendix A) are sufficient to keep CIPA financially solvent and able to meet all \nproject and non-project related costs. The FNPV is negative for the distribution analysis, as the net \nincome stream to CIPA is discounted at the economic opportunity cost of capital. The financial \nanalysis reflects all financial costs facing CIPA, including depreciation, additional staffing costs, \n ", "48  Appendix 8 \n \ntaxes, and loan financing costs that are not reflected in the economic analysis. The economic \nanalysis reflects benefits in the forms of additional earnings to the economy from tourism and lower \ncargo and fuel delivery costs (comparing the with-project scenario to the without-project scenario) \nthat are not reflected in the financial analysis. \n \n26.  As shipping rates to the Cook Islands are regulated by the Government (the Ministry of \nTransport), it is assumed that savings in cargo and fuel delivery costs (comparing the with-project \nscenario to the without-project scenario) will be passed on to ultimate consumers of goods and fuel \nin the Cook Islands and will not be retained by shippers. \n \n27.  As shown in the distribution analysis in Table A8.3 below, the economic benefits of the \nProject accrue to the Government and economy in the forms of taxes and additional tourism \nearnings, and to consumers in the form of cargo and fuel delivery cost savings. Net of the FNPV, \nthe total economic benefits of the Project result in an NPV of the economic net benefits of NZ$5.46 \nmillion. \n \nTable A8.3: Distribution Analysis \n(NZ$ million) \n   Distribution of Project Effects \nEPV \n  Minus  Government \n  FPV  EPV  FPV  CIPA  and Economy  Consumers \nItem             \nBenefits                   \n   Incremental Revenue  5.15   5.15  0.00        \n   Avoided Emergency Repairs  5.55  5.55  0.00        \nConsumer Surplus (delivery \n   cost savings)    9.98  9.98      9.98 \nIncremental Tourism Earnings \n   (cruise ships)    2.34  2.34    2.34     \n   Total Benefits  10.71  23.04  12.33          \nCosts                   \n   Capital Works  15.10  15.10  \u2014        \n   Incremental Operating Costs  2.46  2.47  0.01        \n   Incremental Taxes  1.42  -  (1.42)    1.42     \n   Total Costs  18.98  17.57  (1.41)          \nNet Benefits  (8.28)  5.46   (13.74)  (8.28)       \nGains and Losses           (8.28)  3.76   9.98 \n( ) = negative, CIPA = Cook Islands Ports Authority, EPV = economic present value, FPV = financial present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 9  49 \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  A financial analysis was undertaken to assess the Project\u2019s viability and sustainability. \nRevenues  and  expenditures  were  analyzed  to  year  2025  to  assess  income  from  the  port \noperations. The analysis confirms the ability of Cook Islands Port Authority (CIPA) to increase \nincome through sustainable port operations that grow in line with the anticipated increases in \ngoods  and  traffic  handled  by  the  port.  It  also  confirms  that  CIPA  will  be  able  to  achieve \nacceptable debt coverage over the analysis period. \n \n2.  The Project\u2019s costs are estimated at $18.20 million, of which Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) is financing $6.88 million through an Asian Development Fund (ADF) loan and $8.64 \nmillion through ordinary capital resources (OCR). The balance ($2.68 million) is financed by the \nGovernment. The major components of the Project are realignment and reconstruction of the \nmain  wharf  at  Avatiu  harbor,  widening  of  the  approach  channel  on  its  western  side,  plus \nexpansion and dredging of the inner basin to provide a turning circle 150 meters in diameter. \nPeripheral works will include drainage and port lighting plus the upgrading of bollards, fenders, \nand other facilities for the berthing of larger vessels. \n \n3.  The  accompanying  financial  analysis  measures  the  revenue  generated  from  these \ncomponents with the future costs of operation and maintenance and debt servicing. A financial \ninternal rate of return (FIRR) and net present value (NPV) of the financial benefit of the Project \nto the CIPA are estimated, with appropriate sensitivity analysis. The analysis is carried out by \ncomparing  with-project  and  without-project  scenarios.  Financial  projections  for  CIPA  are \nsummarized in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \nB.  Major Revenue Assumptions, With-Project and Without-Project \n \n4.  Cargo Size and Traffic. The Cook Islands is critically dependent on Avatiu Harbor, as \nthe country is highly import-dependent and 90% of the total imports passes through the port. In \nits present state, the port has a very short remaining life. Without the Project, capacity to handle \ncargo volumes would deteriorate, with high risk of import disruptions and correspondingly high \ncosts  for  frequent  emergency  repairs  and  rehabilitation  work.  With  the  Project,  additional \nrevenues will be generated from the steadily increasing volumes of dry goods and containerized \nmaterials coming into the Cook Islands that are necessary to support economic growth. FY2007 \nhas seen significant growth in imports and a corresponding increase in CIPA revenues. There is \na  direct  and  strong  correlation  between  cargo  volume  and  the  Cook  Island\u2019s  economic \ndevelopment (i.e., cargo volumes at the port will grow in parallel with the general rate of GDP \ngrowth.1 The  Ministry  of  Financial  and  Economic  Management  confirms  that  the  country \nremains on target to meet the Government\u2019s projected sustained real annual growth for the \neconomy of 3.5% per year.2 To be conservative, the analysis has adopted an assumed growth \nin volumes, and hence port revenues, of 2.5% per annum.  \n \n5.  Under both the with-project and without-project scenarios, the assessment of future \nrevenues allows for the one-off introduction of new fees and charges approved for the 2009 \nfinancial year (applying from 1 July 2008). Other revenues will come from the new western \n                                                 \n1  The elasticity of imports (i.e., the ratio of the percentage change in import volumes to a given percentage change in \nreal GDP) is estimated at 1.29 for the period 2002\u20132007. \n2  Government of Cook Islands. 2007.

Revenues with Project. A 2.5% increase in business from 2010 onwards is assumed to \ncontinue in line with expected traffic through the port. Additional income will come from cruise \nships  berthing  alongside  the  wharf  from  2011  onwards,  when  the  port  improvements  and \ndredging will be completed. The costs of the Government\u2019s port-related community service \nobligations (CSOs), presently nonrecoverable by CIPA, are shown separately. These relate to \nthe  interisland  shipping  and  the  maritime  surveillance  patrol  boat,  for  which  berthage  and \nrelated port services are provided without charge by CIPA, and the maritime surveillance and \nMinistry of Marine Resources buildings that are sited on port land, but presently do not pay rent \nto CIPA. All revenue under the with-project scenario is expressed in 2008 dollars with the \nfollowing key assumptions: \n \n(i)  Revenues for 2008 are based on the year to date (31 April 2008) incomes \nannualized for the full year. \n(ii)  Revenues for 2009 and beyond are based on CIPA\u2019s new scale of fees and \ncharges effective from 1 July 2008. \n(iii)  Revenues  for  2009  show  the  cost  of  the  Government\u2019s  CSOs,  estimated \naccording to CIPA\u2019s fees and charges. \n(iv)  Revenues for 2009 and thereafter allow for increased rental fees to CIPA for \nbuildings and development on harbor land. \n(v)  Rental fees for 2009 and thereafter reflect base growth in real terms of 2%. \n(vi)  Marina revenue for 2009 and thereafter reflects base growth in real terms of 2% \nper annum. \n(vii)  Revenue from port core operations for 2010 and thereafter reflects growth in real \nterms of 2.5% due to increasing cargo volumes. \n(viii)  The formal lease of the port and harbor limits to CIPA will allow the transfer of all \nbuilding rents from CIIC to CIPA. \n(ix)  Revenue for the anchoring of cruise boats at the harbor approaches will continue \nat normal rates until the wharf is improved. The income then adjusts for 25 cruise \nships per annum berthing alongside the wharf plus larger cruise ship vessels that \nwill continue to anchor offshore. \n \n7.  Revenues  without  Project.  Without  the  Project,  cargo  volumes  remain  stagnant \nthroughout the analysis period. Urgent repairs to the existing wharf and quay structure are \nassumed to be undertaken between 2009 and 2011, at an estimated cost of NZ$3 million. \nCargo volumes are prevented from declining by undertaking increasingly frequent emergency \nrepairs and rehabilitation work throughout the analysis period. \n \n8.  Revenues included under the with-project scenario from the recently commissioned \nwestern marina are retained without the Project but without real growth, as the port and users \nface constant disruptions due to frequent repair work. Also, additional revenues from buildings \nand  activities  transferred  to  CIPA  from  CIIC  are  constrained  due  to  reduced  commercial \nopportunities in the port, and additional revenue from cruise ship berthing is eliminated. The \ncosts of the Government\u2019s port-related CSOs, presently nonrecoverable by CIPA, are retained. \nAll revenue under the without-project scenario is expressed in 2008 dollars with the following \nkey assumptions: \n \n \n ", "Appendix 9  51 \n(i)  Revenues for 2008 are based on the 2008 year to date (31 April 2008) incomes \nannualized for the full year. \n(ii)  Revenues for 2009 and beyond are based on CIPA\u2019s new scale of fees and \ncharges effective from 1 July 2008. \n(iii)  Revenues  for  2009  show  the  cost  of  the  Government\u2019s  CSO,  estimated \naccording to CIPA\u2019s fees and charges. \n(iv)  Revenues for 2009 and thereafter allow for continued existing rental fees to CIPA \nfor buildings on harbor land. \n(v)  Rental fees for 2009 and thereafter reflect no growth in real terms. \n(vi)  Marina revenue for 2009 and thereafter reflects no growth in real terms. \n(vii)  Revenue from port core operations for 2010 and thereafter reflects no growth in \nreal terms due to stagnant cargo volumes. \n(viii)  The formal lease of the port and harbor limits to CIPA will allow the transfer of all \nbuilding rents from CIIC to CIPA, but these show no real growth from current \nlevels. \n(ix)  Revenue for the anchoring of cruise boats at the harbor approaches will continue \nat current rates through the analysis period.  \n \nC.  Operating Costs, With-Project and Without-Project \n \n9.  With the Project, operating costs are projected into the future based on the following \nassumptions. All costs are expressed in 2008 dollars.  \n(i)  Expenditures are based on 2008 year to date actual expenditures, and increased \nby 1% thereafter. \n(ii)  Depreciation calculations use CIPA\u2019s depreciation rates. \n(iii)  The present wharf\u2019s value is written off in 2010 and there is a recapitalization in \n2010 and 2011 with the construction of the new wharf. \n(iv)  The new ship handling equipment (bollards and fenders) is depreciated. \n(v)  There is an allowance for maintaining the new wharf consistent with international \nnorms. \n(vi)  Allowances are made for periodic dredging of the harbor basin and approaches. \n(vii)  The Government\u2019s corporate tax on profits is 20%. \n \n10.  Without the Project, operating costs are estimated based on the following assumptions.  \n(i)  Expenditures are based on 2008 year to date actual expenditures, and increased \nby 1% thereafter. \n(ii)  Depreciation calculations use CIPA\u2019s depreciation rates, but only on existing \nassets. \n(iii)  Emergency  repair  and  rehabilitation  work  is  increasing  yearly  to  cope  with \ncontinued deterioration of the existing wharf infrastructure. \n(iv)  Allowances are made for periodic dredging of the harbor basin and approaches. \n(v)  The Government\u2019s corporate tax on profits is 20%. \n \nD.  Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) and Financial Projections \n \n11.  For the purposes of the financial analysis, the calculation of the after-tax WACC is based \non the mix of financing from several sources, including the Government, ADF loan funds, and \nADB OCR loan funds. The contributions from the Government are designated as equity. The \nreal  cost  of  debt  reflects  the  cost  of  the  funding  sources  adjusted  for  local  inflation.  The \nopportunity cost of equity has been estimated at 11.5%. A long-term domestic inflation rate of \n ", "52  Appendix 9 \n2.5% has been assumed.3 The after-tax WACC is estimated at 1.23%.

Results of the Financial Assessment and Sensitivity Analysis \n \n12.  Based on the above assumptions, the after-tax financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is \n6.0%, well exceeding the WACC of 1.2%. The financial net present value (FNPV) of the Project, \nwith net income from the Project discounted at the WACC, is NZ$19.1 million. The port project \nhas a payback period of about 18 years. The calculations of the FIRR and the FNPV are \nsummarized in Table A9.2. \n \n13.  Sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the effects of negative changes in the key \nparameters determining CIPA\u2019s financial costs and revenues from the Project. The sensitivity \nanalysis found that the Project remains financially viable in the face of a 20% increase in costs \nor a 20% decrease in revenues. The switching value for the Project for increased construction \ncosts was determined to be 107.7%, and the switching value for decreased revenue was \ndetermined to be \u201323.7%. (The switching value for increased costs and decreased benefits \ncombined was determined to be 12.0%.) The Project is financially most sensitive to decreases \nin forecast revenue, with a sensitivity indicator (SI) of 4.6, and to increases in forecast operating \ncosts (SI=2.7). It is somewhat less sensitive to increases in project construction costs (SI=1.0). \nThese results are summarized in Table A9.3. \n \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2008.

Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy, and the sector analysis, describe \nhow the Project would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty \nreduction strategy of the partner country. \n \nThe Proposed Project \nThe Project is focused on improving the facilities in Avatiu Harbor, Rarotonga, Cook Islands. The current wharf at this \nlocation is in very poor condition and unsafe. As such, it has a very limited life. It is also designed with an angle that \nprevents berthing of vessels longer than 90 meters. The narrow turning basin in the harbor also restricts vessel length. \n \nThe Project will involve rehabilitation, upgrading, and realignment of the international wharf in Avatiu Harbor (creating a \nsingle wharf face that is about 270 meters [m] long), sheet piling along the entire length of the new wharf face, slight \nwidening of the harbor entrance, and dredging of the existing harbor to 8 m below chart datum. In the process, a \nturning basin with a 150 m diameter will be created to accommodate vessels up to 120 m long and with full turning \npotential. In this configuration, vessels up to about 200 m in length could reverse in with tug facilitation, but with no \nturning potential (see site plans at the end of this summary poverty reduction and social strategy). The Project will also \ninvolve improving security of the international wharf, a hazardous material staging area, and rerouting of the petroleum-\nproduct pipeline (currently buried under the wharf), all of which reduce risks to safety at the port. \n \nLinkages to Poverty Reduction \u2013 Cook Islands Context \nAlthough the Cook Islands is one of the better performing economies in the Pacific, with per capita gross national \nincome increasing steadily in recent years (by about 7%\u20138% per annum, from 2000 to 2005, annual growth in gross \ndomestic product slowed from 8.2% in 2003 to 1.8% in 2006. Some of this is due to increasing costs, especially in the \nlast 2\u20133 years (oil price increases being a major factor). Although the Cook Islands is not really characterized by \npoverty per se, and especially on Rarotonga, where 80% of the economy of the Cook Islands is generated, data from \n1998 indicated that 12% of the population was unable to meet the costs of food and other basic needs and services \nthat are essential for a minimum standard of living. This is referred to as the basic needs poverty line, indicative of the \nproportion of households that report having insufficient income (including subsistence production) to meet minimum \ndietary needs in addition to essential expenditures for goods and services that are required for a basic standard of \nliving. In fact, Cook Islands does not have a definition for the poverty line, and official statistics now do not report data \nfor families living below the poverty line. Most poor families live in the outer islands, which do not have much in the way \nof opportunities for cash employment. They rely on government pensions and welfare, plus informal family support \nsystems. There are also some pockets of poor families on Rarotonga. \n \nWith increasing costs of imports, poor families are now more vulnerable than they have been in the past. A key factor in \nreducing the cost of imports (a benefit to all Cook Islanders, but especially so for poor families, which spend a much \ngreater percentage of their incomes on basic, essential commodities) is to find some efficiencies of scale (using larger \nships, for example) to counter the continually rising cost of transportation. This is the main link between the proposed \nProject and poverty reduction, discussed below. \n \nThe proposed Project will make an indirect contribution to poverty reduction in the Cook Islands by maintaining and \nupgrading an effective system of maritime imports, upon which the Cook Islands is almost totally dependent, and \ncreating improved efficiencies to help reduce unit costs of imports. It is consistent with one of the eight priorities in the \nNational Sustainable Development Plan (strengthened and affordable basic infrastructure, transport, and utilities to \nsupport national development). The Project falls within one of four broad areas that are targeted in the ADB Country \nPartnership Strategy for the Cook Islands (strengthened and affordable basic infrastructure, transport, and utilities, \nleading to improved economic and social infrastructure and public sector service delivery). Specific project benefits that \ncontribute to poverty reduction or prevention are detailed below. \n \nSpecific Project Benefits that Contribute to Poverty Reduction or Prevention \nApproximately 90% of the food and 100% of the fuel imported into the Cook Islands comes through Avatiu Harbor. The \ncurrent wharf configuration limits the size of vessels that can berth, resulting in inefficiency in cargo transport and \nhandling and unnecessarily high unit costs for imports. The upgraded facilities will allow larger vessels to use the \nharbor, reducing unit costs. The cost-savings can be passed on to all businesses, government agencies, and \n ", "56  Appendix 10 \nconsumers in the Cook Islands (Rarotonga, Aitutaki, and all the outer islands). For example, the value of imports in the \nCook Islands in 2006 was NZ$131 million, or about NZ$6,000 per person living in the Cook Islands. Even an efficiency \nsavings of 2% (a conservative estimate, assuming all other input costs related to shipment and handling of imports \nremain stable) would amount to $120 per person per year, which is not an insignificant amount.  \n \nThere is a recent specific example of cargo consolidation (maximizing the cargo capacity of a vessel) resulting in \nreduced unit costs. Piggybacking the import of diesel required for Cook Islands energy generators with aviation fuel \nprovided by BP has lowered the unit cost of diesel and allowed electricity tariffs to be reduced by up to 6% (for \ncommercial users). Similar cost savings could be achieved for liquid petroleum gas (LPG), as well, if larger ships were \nable to enter the harbor. There is even a risk that the company that charters the current LPG carrier will be required to \nscale up the size of its vessel to meet growing LPG demand in the Pacific, which would then preclude LPG shipments \nto the Cook Islands altogether (if a larger LPG carrier cannot enter Avatiu Harbor). \n \nThe Project indirectly supports the maintenance of a vibrant tourism sector, which is the main contributor to the Cook \nIslands economy. With up to 100,000 visitors per year, tourism increases the food requirement in the Cook Islands \n(above that required by the local population) by about 10%\u201320% at any one time. Much of that must come through the \nport. Increasing food costs, due to inefficient transportation and handling, reflected in the retail prices of meals in hotels \nand restaurants, then, comprise one more factor reducing the tourism competitiveness of the Cook Islands at a time \nwhen global tourism is likely to recede in any case. \n \nThe rehabilitated and upgraded wharf at Avatiu Harbor will preclude a catastrophic failure of the existing wharf \n(possible in a cyclone or in a ship collision). Thus, a critical lifeline to the Cook Islands (provision of survival essentials \nand commercial opportunities) can be secured. \n \nThe improved facilities in Avatiu Harbor will accommodate passenger cruise ships (especially the smaller Tahiti-based \nships, which typically have a length of about 157 meters or less). At the moment, very few cruise ships can enter Avatiu \nHarbor (the Clipper Odyssey, at 110 meters length, reversed into the harbor in early April 2008). Some larger \npassenger cruise ships try to access Rarotonga by passenger lighters, depending on the sea\u2019s state, but at the \nmoment much local retail business opportunity is lost. For example, there was a pent-up demand from 23 cruise ships \nin FY2007 wanting to enter the harbor. Accommodating the smaller passenger cruise ships (Tahiti-based, and perhaps \nothers) in Avatiu Harbor will provide significant positive economic spinoffs to local businesses throughout Rarotonga. \n \nAlignment of the two sections of the international wharf will allow larger vessels to move further into the harbor, beyond \nthe airport flight path (which has a structure height restriction of 24 meters). At the moment, tall vessels must leave the \nharbor altogether when flights arrive and depart or at least drop their loading booms at these times. With the new wharf \nalignment, this will no longer be necessary (saving time and fuel costs). \n \nThe construction of the wharf and harbor dredging will provide significant local business and labor opportunities, which \nwill themselves create immediate benefits to the Rarotonga economy.  \n \nThe entire Project will be undertaken on port land and within the existing Avatiu Harbor \u201cfootprint,\u201d with the exception of \none small business (a fish restaurant) in premises leased from Cook Islands Investment Corporation on port land which \nwill be moved to an alternate site within the port. There is no requirement for a new land lease by the Ports Authority. \nThe requirement to move or destroy buildings is limited to one Ports Authority shed that is part of the port development \nplus the restaurant business. No houses or roads are affected. This means there are no significant obstacles related to \nland tenure and social issues. That reduces the cost of the Project and increases the efficiency of its implementation, \nrepresenting a net benefit to the Cook Islands economy. As such, the Project will have no direct negative social impact \nor contribute to poverty inasmuch as it will not marginalize any segment of Cook Islands society. \n \nB.  Targeting Classification          \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n   General Intervention;   Individual or Household (TI-H);   Geographic (TI-G);   Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, \nM2, etc.) \n \n2.  Explain the basis for the targeting classification: \nThe proposed Project does not target a specific segment of the Cook Islands population. It is intended to benefit all \nCook Islanders who depend of maritime imports for subsistence and for business.  \n \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  If the Project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \nNo full poverty analysis is required, as this is a GI project. \n ", "Appendix 10  57 \n2.  What resources are allocated in the PPTA/due diligence? \nThe PPTA economist will determine the net economic benefits (in dollar terms) of the proposed Project. That will give a \nmore accurate picture of the potential for poverty reduction when the defined benefits are spread through the Cook \nIslands population. \n2.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross-subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)? \nThis is a very specific infrastructure rehabilitation and upgrading project having no direct link to poor segments of \nCook Islands society or to government policy affecting such groups. Nevertheless, there is an opportunity during the \nconstruction phase of the Project to provide jobs for unemployed youth and other disadvantaged groups (unskilled \nlabor) \n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the Project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit \nfrom the Project? \nThe initial beneficiaries of lower costs from the Project in comparison with the without-project scenario are private and \npublic sector consumers in the Cook Islands, as they will avoid the impact of steeply rising delivery costs that are \nexpected if the harbor is allowed to continue deteriorating. The proposed Project will result in avoidance of increased \ncosts of food, fuel, and goods to consumers that will arise on account of increased freight charges that would occur in \nthe \u201cwithout-project\u201d scenario. Therefore, savings in cargo and fuel delivery costs (comparing the with-project and \nwithout-project scenarios) will be retained by ultimate consumers of goods and fuel in the Cook Islands and not by \nshippers. The poor and socially excluded will benefit from these cost savings like all other consumers, but their benefit, \nas a percentage of household income, will be higher compared to that of most Cook Islanders. Secondary benefits of \nthe Project, including economic spinoffs from new users of the port (such as cruise ships) that lead to increases in retail \ntrade should also percolate through the local population in Rarotonga.  \n \nWhat are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed Project? \nConsumers in the Cook Islands need to know that the Government is making all efforts to stabilize or even reduce the \ncost of imports upon which the Cook Islands are so dependent. As part of the economic analysis of the Project, \nefficiencies of scale related to shipping with larger vessels need to be clearly defined and the potential distribution of \nsuch benefits mapped in terms of different segments of the Cook Islands population.  \n \n2.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the Project \naddress them? \nThe main potential constraint upon Cook Islanders\u2019 accessing the proposed benefits of the Project is that the cost \nsavings in transportation and handling of cargo at Avatiu Harbor will be absorbed in increased port fees or taken up in \nthe profit margins of the shipping companies. The Government will need to monitor the Ports Authority\u2019s wharfage fees, \nas well as the local wholesale and retail prices of fuel, food, building materials, etc., in order to gauge the extent to \nwhich cost savings due to more efficient transportation and handling of cargo at Avatiu Harbor are passed on to \nconsumers and not retained by the shipping companies and agents. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Indicate the potential initial stakeholders.  \nInitial  stakeholders  include  the  Ports  Authority,  local  shipping  companies  and  agents,  the  petroleum  products \ncompanies, local wholesale and retail businesses, and all consumers in the Cook Islands, as well as the local civil \nengineering companies that may be involved in design and construction of the Project. Secondary stakeholders include \nthe Government agencies that have some regulatory jurisdiction over the Project or a technical interest (including the \nMinistry  of  Works,  National  Environment  Service,  Ministry  of  Marine  Resources).  Tertiary  stakeholders  include \nenvironmental  nongovernment  organizations,  local  business  associations,  and  local  landowners  (representing \ncommunity interest in the Project and acting as conduits of information as the Project develops). \n \n2.  What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., \nworkshops,  community  mobilization,  involvement  of  nongovernment  organizations  and  community-based \norganizations, etc.)? \nConsultations have already been held with all identified stakeholders to determine their interests and concerns \nrelated to the Project. A land use policy workshop was used as a venue to describe the Project and solicit ideas, \nconcerns, and issues from representatives of all stakeholders. As a result of the one-on-one consultations and the \ngroup meeting, no specific social or poverty-related issues have been raised. Environmental issues (which can be \naddressed  in  project  design  and  by  mitigation  during  construction)  will  be  documented  in  the  project  initial \nenvironmental examination. \n \n ", "58  Appendix 10 \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n      Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \nOngoing information sharing and stakeholder consultation will continue, especially as the engineering design develops \nand the economic aspects of the Project are analyzed. \n \n4.  Will a C&P plan be prepared?    Yes           No    Please explain.  \nThe current style and format of consultation and participation (one-on-one meetings and occasional group sessions) \nshould continue as the Project is designed. To date, this has ensured that all stakeholders are informed and given a \nchance to be involved, and there is already a sense of inclusiveness in the Project. There is no evidence that the \nProject has adversaries (although there is always discussion of alternative port options, which are outside the scope of \nthe Ports Authority mandate and the focus of the proposed loan). \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project/program? \nThere are no gender issues or specific opportunities for gender equality with this proposed Project, given its very \nlimited focus on construction and dredging. Nevertheless, the benefits of the Project (potentially stabilized or reduced \ncosts of imports) will be pervasive and affect all segments of the Cook Islands population: women, men, youth, and \ndisadvantaged groups). \n \n2.  Does  the  proposed  project/program  have  the  potential  to  promote  gender  equality  and/or  women\u2019s \nempowerment by improving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and \nparticipation in decision making?        Yes           No    Please explain. \nThe Project has a very sharp focus on shipping and cargo handling (improving efficiency, and ensuring the integrity of \nport services well into the future). It does not lend itself to policy change, governance per se, or selective access to \nservices and benefits. \n \n3.  Could the proposed Project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or to widen gender inequality?         \n          Yes           No    Please explain. \nThe main benefits of the Project will accrue to the business community and all Cook Islands consumers. There is no \ngender bias evident in these benefits, and no adverse impact on women and girls is expected. \n \n \nIII.
