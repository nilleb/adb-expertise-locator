INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  supported  the  urban  water  supply  and \nsanitation (WSS) sectors in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) since the early \n1990s.1 During the 2006 Country Programming Confirmation Mission, the Government of the \nLao PDR confirmed its request for technical assistance2 (TA) to support preparation of the Small \nTowns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project. A TA Fact-Finding Mission visited the Lao \nPDR from 22 to 25 August 2006 and reached an understanding with the Government on the TA \nimpact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost and financing arrangements, and \nterms of reference. The TA supports the Water Supply Sector Policy Statement (1999) and the \nWater Supply Sector Investment Plan (SIP) 1999\u20132020 and is aligned with the Sixth National \nSocioeconomic Development Plan (SEDP6) 2006\u20132010. It is included in the Lao PDR Country \nStrategy and Program Update 2006\u20132008. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.   \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  In 2005, the population of the Lao PDR was about 5.6 million, with a density of about 24 \npeople per square kilometer. About 75% of the population lives in nearly 12,000 small rural \nvillages, and the remaining 25% in 142 officially designated urban centers in 139 districts. The \nLao PDR experienced a sharp reduction in poverty from 46% in 1992 to 32% in 2003, and the \nestimated per capita gross domestic product reached $491 in 2005. As the Lao PDR becomes \nmore  regionally  connected  by  better  road  networks  and  expanded  interregional  trade,  the \nimportance of developing small towns as key administrative and economic centers is increasing, \nparticularly in the poorest 47 districts. \n3.  In 1999, the Government of the Lao PDR issued a policy statement3 that sets the sector \ntarget of providing 24-hour access to safe drinking water for 80% of the urban population by \n2020. Based on the 2005 census, overall access to safe water supply in urban areas is about \n55% (716,000 urban residents), with 43% of urban households having access to piped water.4 \nHowever, large differences exist between the five largest towns (Vientiane, Savannakhet, Pakse, \nThakhek, and Luang Prabang) and the 139 small towns.5 In 2003, overall access to piped water \nin urban areas was 39% but was about 69% in the five largest towns and only about 17% in \nsmall towns. Similarly, about 54% of urban households have pour-flush toilets, with 78% in the \nfive largest towns and 42% in small towns.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1991.

The TA first \nappeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 16 August 2006. \n3  Lao PDR. 1999. Prime Ministerial Decision No. 37/PM on Management and Development of Water Supply and \nWastewater Sector. Vientiane (30 September). \n4  According to the census, safe water comes from pipes or protected wells and/or boreholes, but may still require \ntreatment prior to distribution due to high salinity or mineral content. The Water Supply Authority has prepared draft \nlegislations on water quality standards that comply with the World Health Organization requirements. \n5  Urban centers with populations of 2,000\u201320,000 people are considered small towns. On average, small towns with \na projected population greater than 4,000 people by 2015 will be considered for inclusion into the project.  \n ", "2   \n4.  Improved water supply and sanitation (WSS) helps reduce poverty and the burden of \ndisease,  thereby  improving  the  quality  of  life,  especially  for  women  and  girls.  Small  town \nresidents lack access to safe water and have inadequate sanitation coverage. Residents often \nrely  on  shallow  wells,  ponds  and  streams,  which  are  often  biologically  contaminated.  On \naverage, residents require about 40 to 70 liters per capita per day, depending on the cost of \nwater, household income, distance to the water source, and effort required for collection. In \nsmaller  towns,  a  number  of  small-scale  independent  providers  (SSIPs)  offer  basic  water \nservices to households and communities at a higher cost than regulated providers.6 Nearly half \nof small town residents do not have proper toilet facilities and use open ground, fields, local \ndrains, and watercourses for disposal of excreta and wastewater. About 7% of households use \nseptic tanks systems that discharge to drains or soakaways.7 Markets and temples have few \npublic toilets, and fewer than 10% of primary schools have proper latrines. Lack of safe water \nsupply and poor sanitation harm the health of individuals. The poor are more vulnerable to \nhealth shocks due to the high cost of treating disease and lost work days for recovery. Diarrhea \nis a major cause of child mortality. The 2005 census estimates the mortality rate of children \nunder 5 years old at 98 per 1,000 live births.  \n5.  Individual  property  owners  are  responsible  for  developing  and  managing  on-site \nsanitation systems, which often vary in quality and hygienic safety because of weak provincial \nsanitation regulations and unclear institutional responsibility. The Northern and Central Regions \nWater  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project,  Phase  I  (NCRWSSSP-I)  requires  provincial \ngovernments to introduce modified sanitation regulations and property owners to use sanitation \nsystems that have been approved by the District Office of Communication, Transport, Post and \nConstruction  (OCTPC)  before  connecting  to  the  piped  water  supply  system.8 In  addition, \nexperiences from previous WSS projects show that links between water and sanitation have to \nbe  well  understood  in  communities  to  improve  health  and  hygiene,  generate  demand  for \nsanitation facilities, and improve the operation and maintenance (O&M) of on-site facilities.  \n6.  In 2005, the Government updated the 1999 SIP to reflect its emphasis on equitable \ndevelopment  by  improving  small  towns,  especially  those  in  the  47  poorest  districts.9 The \nupdated SIP provides a balanced, stepwise approach to water supply development in the Lao \nPDR, as investments are prioritized according to population; poverty status; location relative to a \nmajor  road,  growth  corridor,  or  international  border;  tourism  potential;  and  the  provincial \ngovernment\u2019s development priorities. It identifies 112 priority small towns and estimates future \ninvestment needs at $103 million.10 The NCRWSSSP-I includes 10 of the 18 first-ranked towns.  \n7.  The Government is committed to improving access to safe and reliable urban water \nsupply in a decentralized sector. The policy statement had two major impacts: (i) creating the \nWater Supply Authority (WASA) under the Ministry of Communication, Transport, Post and \nConstruction (MCTPC) to regulate and coordinate activities in urban water supply, including \nwater  quality  control,  and  (ii)  decentralizing  urban  WSS  management  from  the  central  to \nprovincial governments. Nam Papa Lao was divided into Nam Papa Vientiane and provincial \nnam papas (PNPs), each becoming an autonomous state-owned enterprise under the provincial \nDepartment of Communication, Transport, Post, and Construction (DCTPC). The Water Supply \nDivision (WSD) of the Department of Housing and Urban Planning (DHUP) is responsible for \n                                                 \n6  The estimated cost was KN10,000\u2013KN15,000 per cubic meter (compared with KN1,700 from regulated providers). \nSee Water Supply Authority and Department of Housing and Urban Planning. 2004. Building Consensus for Small \nTowns Water Supply Management Models in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. Vientiane. \n7  Sanitation data collected during project preparation of the NCRWSSSP-I. \n8   Ministry of Health manages urban environmental hygiene, and each provincial government develops its own program.  \n9  Based on Instruction No. 010/PM, 72 districts are classified as poor, of which 47 are classified as the poorest.  \n10  Total investment needs are about $267 million. The balance is for Vientiane and secondary and provincial towns. \n ", "  3\nstrategic planning and the long-term management of the sector. Decree No. 191/PM (2005) \nstrengthens the institutional framework for urban WSS by defining the legal foundation of WASA \nand specifying its institutional responsibilities as a regulatory agency.11 While ADB and other \ndevelopment  partners  have  supported  the  institutional  strengthening  of  WASA,  WSD,  and \nPNPs,12 developing an action plan, based on an assessment of past programs, would help \nguide future capacity development.  \n8.  A recent evaluation of water supply systems developed earlier indicates a need for minor \nrehabilitation  works  to  restore  and  improve  their  functionality.13 Further  evaluation  of  earlier \nsystems is required to ensure that they have not fallen into disuse for lack of O&M. The National \nWater Supply Tariff Policy14 aims to strengthen the financial sustainability of PNPs. WASA assists \nthe PNPs establish tariffs to support operations and adopt appropriate water supply service levels. \nThe NCRWSSSP-I supports building PNPs\u2019 financial capacity to generate funds for capital repairs. \nThe  NCRWSSSP-I  introduces  subproject-specific  progressive  tariffs  with  three  consumption \nblocks recovering full O&M costs plus 30% of capital investment costs. A further assessment of \nthe  financial  management  capacities  of  PNPs  and  a  review  to  analyze  the  design  and \nperformance of different tariff structures will support ongoing NCRWSSSP-I activities. Collecting \ntime series data on water quality and quantity testing will also prevent future rehabilitation needs.  \n9.  Lessons identified from the past experiences of ADB and other development partners \ninclude (i)  strengthening human  and institutional capacity in the provinces and  districts; (ii) \nimproving system sustainability and reducing excessive capital costs; (iii) devoting sufficient \nresources to raw water assessments to minimize water treatment costs and the risk of water \nshortages; (iv) strengthening the capacity and management skills of PNPs; and (v) preparing \ncomprehensive  WSS  projects  that  support  drainage  and  sanitation  measures,  community \nparticipation, health awareness, and training and operating manuals in the local language.  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the TA is to contribute to the Government\u2019s goal of providing 24-hour access \nto safe drinking water for 80% of the urban population by 2020. The outcome is an agreed sector \ninvestment project designed to develop water supply systems and improve sanitation conditions in \nabout 20 priority small towns in designated poor and poorest districts of the Lao PDR.15 It aims to \nreduce poverty and improve access, quality, reliability, and sustainability of water supply services \nand sanitation conditions for residents. An initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \n11.  The TA will have the following outputs:  \n(i)  A project preparation and feasibility study of a sector investment project for water \nsupply systems and improved sanitation covering about 20 small towns. Two or \nthree sample subprojects designed to be financially, economically, environmentally, \nand socially sustainable will be prepared for appraisal during the TA. The project \nwill  include  water  supply  improvements,  public  awareness  for  water  use  and \nhygiene,  action  to  enhance  community  and  female  participation  in  WSS,  and \ninvestigations of raw water sources and the collection of time-series data.  \n                                                 \n11  WASA was established as a sector regulatory agency by Decree No. 66/PM, dated 20 May 1999, and was \namended by Decree No. 191/PM, dated 1 July 2005, on the regulation of urban water supply operations.  \n12 The Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation provides support for WASA and WSD under the NCRWSSSP-I.  \n13  ADB. 2006.

Based  on  a \ncomprehensive  review  and  evaluation  of  water  supply  systems  developed  in \nprevious projects, about one or two rehabilitation works for existing water supply \nsystems will be prepared as sample subprojects.  \n(iii)  Assessment of past and planned capacity-development activities in urban WSS \nand development of a capacity development action plan for delivery of urban \nWSS  services.  The  action  plan  will  include  recommendations  to  strengthen \ncapacity (a) for water supply sector regulation, planning, and management in \nWASA and WSD; (b) to manage sustainable urban WSS services in provincial \nand  branch  nam  papas  and  DCTPCs  and  OCTPCs;  and  (c)  to  conduct \nparticipatory local planning and development in MCTPC, community action teams, \nand village water supply and sanitation units.  \n(iv)  Identification of SSIPs for potential public-private partnership initiatives in the \nproposed subproject towns under the ensuing project.   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA supports the preparation of a sector investment project and will incorporate \nlessons from projects supported by ADB and other development partners. The TA will be \nimplemented in two parts. Part 1 includes identifying priority small towns for WSS, including \nrecommendations on priority rehabilitation works. Prior to the fielding of the consultant team, the \nexecuting agency (EA) shall submit a list of candidate towns and works. Small towns will be \nevaluated considering the updated Sector Investment Plan 1999\u20132020, the initial screening \ncriteria established under the NCRWSSSP-I, Government priorities, presence in the 47 poorest \ndistricts, ongoing support by development partners in the WSS sector, stakeholder consultations, \nand the results of site inspections. The review of tariff structures and performance management \nof PNPs will be undertaken early in TA implementation. The inception report will include (i) a list \nof about 20 subproject towns, including recommendations for rehabilitation works, that will be \nincluded in the design and feasibility study of the sector investment project; (ii) identification of \n2\u20133  sample  subproject  towns  and  1\u20132  sample  rehabilitation  works  representative  of  the \nremaining subproject towns, for preparation during the TA; and (iii) initial findings from the \nreview of tariff structures and performance management of PNPs. The final list of subprojects \nwill be geographically clustered to minimize costs and enhance implementation efficiency.  \n13.  Part 2 includes preparing a sector investment project and studying feasibility for about 20 \ntowns, including a maximum of three sample subproject towns and rehabilitation works. It will \ninclude  appropriate  social  assessments  and  plans,  raw  water  assessments,  environmental \nexaminations, resettlement plans, financial and economic analyses, institutional assessment, \nand detailed preparation for each sample subproject. It will also include components on water \nsupply development and improvement, institutional strengthening, capacity building, and public \nawareness and community action. Past public awareness and sanitation initiatives in urban \nWSS projects will be evaluated to determine the effectiveness of programs in changing hygiene \nbehavior and generating public demand for sanitation facilities. New initiatives will incorporate \nongoing programs of the Ministry of Health and other development partners. \n14.  Consultants\u2019 key activities will include required reviews and assessments for delivering \nspecified TA outputs, a series of stakeholder consultations and TA workshops to disseminate \ninformation and seek consensus on project design, and the preparation of required TA reports. \nParticipatory planning and appraisal techniques will be used to understand community priorities \nand perceptions regarding urban WSS. ADB will continue dialogue with the Government during \n ", "  5\nthe  TA  on  policy  and  institutional  changes  proposed  under  the  NCRWSSSP-I,  and  with \ndevelopment partners to avoid overlap and duplication in WSS investments. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $600,000 equivalent, of which ADB will provide $500,000. \nThe  TA  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the \nGovernment of Japan. The Government will finance the remaining $100,000 in kind, covering \noffice accommodation and utilities, remuneration of counterpart staff, and training and workshop \nfacilities. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to \nfinance any ensuing project. The cost estimates and financing arrangements are in Appendix 3.  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  MCTPC  will be the  EA for the TA as it has  overall  responsibility  for facilitating  and \ncoordinating the development of national water supply and wastewater management systems. \nThe EA has assigned the project coordination unit (PCU)16 to be the implementing agency for the \nTA and ensure continuity, integration of activities, and the benefits of experience gained. The PCU \nwill be responsible for the day-to-day coordination and monitoring of TA activities and will provide \nguidance to consultants, facilitate stakeholder workshops, and supervise surveys. To ensure \ncontinuity of guidance in the water and sanitation sector, the steering committee established for \nthe NCRWSSSP-I will also serve for this TA.  \n17.  A team of consultants will be recruited for 39 person-months (16 international person-months \nand 23 national person-months) in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(April 2006, as amended from time to time) following the quality- and cost-based selection method \nand using a simplified technical proposal. Consulting services include expertise in water supply \nengineering, sector policy and institutional reforms, public utilities regulation, project economic and \nfinancial analyses, poverty and social analyses including gender and ethnic issues, resettlement, \nenvironment, and water supply systems management. An indicative outline terms of reference is in \nAppendix  4.  Equipment  for  the  TA  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (April 2006, as amended from time to time) and given to the EA after the TA.  \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 8 months from February to September 2007. TA \nconsultants will submit an inception report within 1 month of TA start-up, which will propose the \nmethodology for carrying out activities for the full duration of the TA. An interim report will \nincorporate survey findings and be submitted within 2 months of TA implementation. A draft final \nreport will be submitted within 5 months of TA implementation. The final report will incorporate \ncomments  from  the  Government  and  ADB,  and  will  be  submitted  at  the  end  of  TA \nimplementation. Meetings will be held among the Government, ADB, and the consultant team \nduring inception, interim, and completion of the TA. The ensuing project will follow the same \nmodality as the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project and the NCRWSSSP-I. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for preparing the Small Towns Water \nSupply and Sanitation Sector Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n16 The PCU consists of a full-time project director, a deputy director, an accountant, and other relevant staff.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nIs the sector identified as a national \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes   Yes \npriority in country poverty partnership \npriority in country poverty analysis?        No    No \nagreement?   \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR): \n \nWater supply and sanitation (WSS) play significant roles in reducing poverty. Access to safe and reliable water is a \nfundamental human need, and the lack of clean water affects both the physical and social health of individuals. \nImproved WSS helps reduce poverty, especially for women by (i) reducing the time and money spent on purchasing, \ncollecting, treating, and storing water and (ii) improving hygiene and health of families and communities. Water-related \nand environmental diseases have high economic and social consequences for individuals and households (e.g., the \nhigh medical expenses required to treat diseases and lost working days to recover from illness). Poor and vulnerable \nhouseholds face a greater risk of impoverishment and marginalization. Project preparatory technical assistance (TA) \nwill develop a sector investment project that contributes to the Government efforts to provide safe and reliable water \nsupply to 80% of urban residents by 2020. The Government\u2019s Water Supply Sector Policy Statement (1999) sets the \ntarget of providing 24-hour access to safe drinking water to 80% of its urban population by 2020, and the Sector \nInvestment Plan lists the water supply needs for urban centers in the order of priority for rehabilitation, expansion, or \ndevelopment. The National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (2004) identifies 47 priority districts to further \nfacilitate poverty reduction and more rapid improvement in other Millennium Development Goal targets. The Sixth \nNational Socioeconomic Development Plan 2006-2010 outlines the Government\u2019s commitment to increasing the \ndistribution of sanitized water to the population in urban and suburban areas for poverty reduction, including increased \naccess to clean water supply and latrines in schools and households.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nA poverty and social analysis (PSA) is required to support and enhance the overall project design and feasibility study \nof sample subproject towns. The analysis will situate the Lao PDR within the region using country-level socioeconomic \nindicators, and the individual subproject towns within the province and district. The PSA will then assess the poverty \nand social conditions of individual populations in (i) about 20 small towns that will be selected for sector investment \nproject design and feasibility in the 47 poorest districts and (ii) priority towns that will be eligible for WSS rehabilitation \nworks. As early as possible, basic poverty and social data will be collected through secondary sources and key \ninformant interviews in districts, before determining population projections. Socioeconomic surveys of the sample \nsubproject towns will be conducted after the sample subproject towns are selected. The PSA will (i) determine the \ntypes of poverty and social impacts\u2014positive or negative\u2014on different population groups, (ii) identify measures to \nmitigate the increased risk of negative effects on population groups from land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) and \nthe environment, and (iii) identify enhancement measures that support ongoing government programs and/or specific \nproject activities for more equitable project outcomes. The analysis will build on lessons from the Northern and Central \nRegions Water Supply and Sanitation Project, Phase I (NCRWSSSP-I) and other WSS and urban development \nprojects in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). For instance, the village area improvements component \nof the Vientiane Integrated Urban Development Project identifies the following key lessons: (i) enhance community \nownership by recognizing and quantifying individual voluntary contributions and (ii) increase local governance and \ntransparency by posting individual and community contributions on a board in the village. The PSA will address the \nimpact of water-related diseases on household expenditure and provide suggestions on ways in which the project \ncontributes to reduced medical costs incurred from waterborne diseases. Data will be disaggregated by poverty level, \nsex, and ethnic group where feasible.  \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nA stakeholder analysis will be undertaken to identify key project stakeholders, their project-related interests, and their \nrole in determining project feasibility and success. A wide range of stakeholders and beneficiaries will be consulted \nduring project preparation, including Government officials from the ongoing Water Supply and Sanitation Sector \nProject and the NCRWSSSP-I. Other stakeholders include government agencies, international and bilateral agencies, \nnongovernment organizations, mass organizations (e.g., Lao Women\u2019s Union and Lao Front), provincial and district \nauthorities, civil society, private water vendors, and project-affected people and communities. The stakeholder \nanalysis will be disaggregated by gender and ethnic group where possible.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nA participation strategy for the ensuing project will be prepared based on (i) an expanded stakeholder analysis \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \nundertaken during project preparation and (ii) records of consultations noted in the PSA. Disclosure of documents on \nthe environment, ethnic groups, and resettlement will be in accordance with ADB's Public Communications Policy \n(2005). The overall participation strategy will also include participation plans outlined in social safeguard plans.  \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nLao women are responsible for a variety of tasks related to water, sanitation, and hygiene in their households and \ncommunities. Based on the gender analysis conducted for the NCRWSSSP-I, women and children spend as much as \n1\u20132 hours daily collecting water from distant sources. Unsafe water (i.e., high in iron or calcium or contaminated with \nwastewater) adversely affects the health of individuals and families, causing water-related diseases and reproductive \nhealth problems.  \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes     No \n \nA gender analysis will be undertaken during project preparation. The gender strategy for the project will include a \ngender action plan and will build on the one prepared for the NCRWSSSP-I. The analysis will be part of the overall \nPSA. Gender activities will be included that make the ensuing project more responsive to women\u2019s water supply \nneeds. Actions will also be applied to individual subproject design with measurable indicators. In addition, specific \ngender concerns facing women in land acquisition and resettlement also will be addressed. \nE.
