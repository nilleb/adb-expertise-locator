INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) fielded a Fact-Finding Mission in March and April \n2008  upon  the  request  of  the  Government  of  the  Philippines  (Government)  for  a  project \npreparatory technical assistance (PPTA)1 for the proposed Water District Development Sector \nProject (WDDSP). The WDDSP will assist the Government in its continued effort to improve \nwater supply and sanitation services for the urban population outside Metro Manila, and to \nachieve the related Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets.2 The objectives, scope, cost, \nfinancing plan, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference for the PPTA are based \non the understanding reached with the Government during the Fact-Finding Mission. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The urban water supply outside Metro Manila is provided by more than 1,000 local- \ngovernment-owned  water  utilities  and  about  500  water  districts.  Water  districts  are  local \ncorporate  entities  that  provide  water  supply  and  sanitation  services3 within  their  areas  of \nresponsibility, which may include one or more cities and municipalities. As of 2005, there were \n585 water districts, of which 463 were operational, serving about 14 million people (about 21% \nof the total population of 67 million people living outside Metro Manila). The majority of the water \ndistricts (about 67%) are classified as \u201csmall,\u201d while only about 3% are categorized as \u201clarge,\u201d \nand about 1% as \u201cvery large.\u201d 4 \n \n3.  Water  districts  were  created  through  Presidential  Decree  198\u2014also  known  as  the \nProvincial Water Utilities Act of 1973\u2014to be independently operated, managed, and controlled \nentities. The act established the Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA)\u2014a national level, \ngovernment-owned and controlled corporation\u2014to provide water districts with financial and \ntechnical  assistance,  and  to  serve  as  their  regulator.  LWUA  has  established  itself  as  the \ndominant lender to the sector, focusing primarily on the larger and more viable water districts. \nAs a result, smaller water districts serving poorer areas of the country have had much less \naccess to LWUA funding and have not been able to enhance service coverage and quality. \nWhile LWUA has been generally successful in carrying out its mandated responsibilities as a \nfinancial and technical provider, the Government has recognized a need for major reforms in the \nsector, primarily with regard to financing.   \n \n4.  In 2004, Executive Order (EO) 279 was approved to provide for comprehensive reform \nof the financing policies of the water supply sector and to streamline LWUA\u2019s organizational \nstructure. EO 279 mandates that LWUA focus its lending operations and assistance on less \ncreditworthy water districts, with the aim of graduating them to creditworthy status.  Creditworthy \nwater districts are expected to access the commercial financial market (e.g., government-owned \nfinancial institutions such as Development Bank of the Philippines, Land Bank of the Philippines, \nand private banks) for funding. Implementation of EO 279, including reorganization of LWUA \nand classification of water districts, is ongoing.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 June 2008. \n2  Goal 7\u2014Ensure environmental sustainability; Target 7.C\u2014Halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without \nsustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. \n3  Sanitation in the context of water districts refers to the provision of wastewater collection and treatment services; it \ndoes not include solid waste management and drainage. \n4 The classification is based on parameters including, for example, revenues, fixed assets, number of service \nconnections, and net income.  \n ", "2   \n5.  The main issues for water districts include: (i) the high number of small utilities with low \nefficiency, (ii) lack of capacity for project development and implementation, (iii) low service \nquality (e.g., interrupted supply, uncertain water quality, high level of nonrevenue water, low \npressure, low coverage), (iv) need to enhance financial performance, and (v) major investment \nneeded for infrastructure expansion and rehabilitation. While water districts are also mandated \nto  provide  sanitation  in  their  service  areas,  there  are  only  a  few  examples  where  this  is \npracticed. This is mainly because of (i) lack of cost recovery for sanitation, (ii) institutional \nfragmentation, and (iii) lack of public awareness and willingness to pay for sanitation.  \n \n6.  The main challenges for LWUA and the water districts to effect major reforms and \nimprovements in the water and sanitation sector include: \n \n(i)  Following approval of EO 279 in 2004, LWUA remains in a transition phase and \nneeds support to focus effectively on the critical elements of its new mandate. \nThese  include  a  full  review  and  classification  of  the  water  districts  by \ncreditworthiness, adoption of a graduation plan for the less creditworthy water \ndistricts,  establishment  of  guidelines  on  the  amalgamation  of  smaller  water \ndistricts, and institution of new lending facilities and products primarily aimed at \nless creditworthy water districts.  \n(ii)  While a number of water districts are well-managed, there are issues that many \nwater districts need to address to reach self-sufficiency and attain viable growth. \nThese include inadequate financing for system expansion; insufficient skills and \ntechnical  expertise  necessary  for  the  efficient  management  of  water  supply \nsystems; marketing problems, including limited service areas and slow growth of \nservice  connections;  and  situations  where  households  have  easy  access  to \ngroundwater sources, which reduces demand for the water districts\u2019 services. \nNonrevenue water levels are typically in the range of 30%\u201340%, and sometimes \neven higher.5  \n(iii)  The majority of the water districts (about 67%) are categorized as small water \ndistricts, limited mainly by the geography and economic conditions of the city or \nmunicipality that they serve. This lack of economies of scale contributes to the \noperational inefficiency of most water districts.  \n(iv)  In 2002, basic sanitation services were accessible by about 81% of the urban \npopulation and about 61% of the rural population. Public awareness of the need \nfor  improved  sanitation  and  willingness  to  pay  for  services  is  generally  low. \nNationwide, more than 80% of households have septic tanks, while only about \n2% of the population is connected to a sewer system.6 Septic tanks, however, \nare mostly inadequately maintained, if at all, and not regularly desludged. Sludge \nfrom septic tanks requires further treatment in septage treatment plants, but is \noften disposed of in an uncontrolled manner to the detriment of public health and \nthe environment. Under the provisions of the Provincial Water Utilities Act, 1973, \nwater districts are mandated to provide both water supply and sanitation services \nwithin their area of responsibility. The WDDSP will provide assistance to LWUA \nto implement pilot projects for sanitation and support capacity building for LWUA \nand the water districts. \n \n                                                 \n5  Nonrevenue water is water that has been treated and distributed, but does not produce any revenues. It includes (i) \nphysical losses caused by leakages; and (ii) commercial losses resulting from illegal connections, meter under \nregistration, and billing inefficiencies. \n6  Partial sewer systems are available in a few cities only, including in some areas of Metro Manila, Zamboanga, \nVigan, and Baguio.  \n ", "  3\n7.  Role of ADB. Since 1975, ADB has supported the sector by approving five loan projects \nfor LWUA for a total amount of $178 million.7  The proposed WDDSP, which is planned as a \nsector  loan  for  a  tentative  loan  amount  of  $50  million,  (i)  will  continue  ADB\u2019s  long-term \ncooperation with LWUA; (ii) is in line with the 2005\u20132007 country strategy and program, and \nADB\u2019s Water Financing Program;8 (iii) will contribute to the Government\u2019s objective to provide \nimproved water supply to the country; and (iv) will support achievement of related MDG targets.9 \nIt will finance much needed investment and capacity building for a number of water districts, and \nwill  support  the  reorganization  of  LWUA.  The  WDDSP  will  address  lessons  learned  from \nprevious ADB-financed projects, including (i) lack of timely provision of counterpart funds by the \nGovernment; (ii) limited capacity of small water districts to develop and implement projects; and \n(iii) the need to establish and integrate the project performance monitoring system with LWUA\u2019s \nmanagement information system in a timely manner.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The PPTA will prepare the WDDSP as a project suitable for ADB financing. The project \nwill  help  improve  living  conditions  of  the  urban  population  outside  Metro  Manila,  enhance \ncompetitiveness by developing water supply infrastructure, and build the capacity of water \nutilities. It will also support the institutional development of LWUA and contribute to much \nneeded sector reform. The initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n9.  The  outcome  of  the  PPTA  will  be  the  design  of  the  WDDSP  agreed  upon  by  the \nDepartment of Finance, LWUA, the participating water districts, the Government, and ADB. The \nPPTA will prepare (i) components for urban water supply and sanitation services improvement \nand performance enhancement; and (ii) implementation support and institutional development \nprograms  for  LWUA  and  water  districts  to  address  sector  reform,  governance,  and  public \nawareness. Subject to the outcome of the PPTA, the WDDSP will be processed for approval in \n2009.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The  proposed  PPTA  for  preparing  the  WDDSP  will  be  implemented  following  a \nconsultative process. The project will be prepared in accordance with relevant national legal \nrequirements and standards; and ADB policies, strategies, and guidelines. The PPTA will be \ncarried out in two phases, which may partly overlap. \n \n11.  Phase 1. Phase 1 will (i) review the water supply and sanitation sector in urban areas \noutside of Metro Manila; (ii) assess the status of legal and regulatory reform; (iii) assess water \ndistricts\u2019 demand for financing water supply and sanitation infrastructure through LWUA and \nother funding sources; (iv) select suitable water districts for pilot activities to promote reform in \nthe sector, taking into account their financial status, and priority investment and institutional \ndevelopment requirements; (v) prepare a financial and institutional analysis of LWUA; and (vi) \n                                                 \n7  Of the past three loan projects, two were rated successful, and one was rated partly successful. Two earlier \nprojects approved in 1975 and 1981 were not rated, as this was not practice at that time. \n8  Under the Water Financing Program announced in 2006, ADB intends to double financing for the water sector. The \nPhilippines is one of six priority countries targeted under the program. \n9  Lack of investment compounded by rapid growth of population have resulted in a decrease of access to safe \ndrinking water in urban areas from 93% in 1990 to 90% in 2002, and in rural areas from 82% in 1990 to 77% in \n2002.  \n ", "4   \nprepare  an  initial  assessment  of  potential  issues,  hindrances,  and  risks.  Activities  will  be \ncomplemented by workshops and seminars. \n \n12.  Criteria for water district selection will be based primarily on (i) demand for improved \nwater supply and sanitation; (ii) fiscal capacity, financial management, commitment to reform, \nand governance; (iii) focus on serving low-income communities; (iv) well-defined investment \nneeds; and (v) project preparedness. Performance and governance criteria will be emphasized. \nPhase 1 will be completed within 3 months. \n \n13.  Phase 2. Phase 2 will last about 5 months and will include (i) preparation of subproject \nappraisal reports (SPARs) for up to five water districts; (ii) preparing the WDDSP to a level of \ndetail suitable for ADB financing; (iii) development of implementation and funds-channeling \narrangements; (iv) preparation of institutional development and capacity building programs; and \n(v) workshops and seminars, as applicable. \n \n14.  In designing water supply system improvements, the PPTA will consider, among other \ncomponents, (i) nonrevenue water reduction; (ii) network extension; (iii) mobilizing idle system \ncapacity; (iv) measures, particularly financial, to facilitate installation of connections for poor \nhouseholds; (v) cash flow enhancement; (vi) energy efficiency; (vii) water quality monitoring and \nimprovement;  and  (viii)  water  sources  development.  In  designing  sanitation  system \nimprovements,  the  PPTA  will  address  low-cost  solutions  (e.g.,  septic  tanks  and  septage \nmanagement, package treatment plants), and wastewater quality monitoring. The PPTA will \nanalyze the role of water districts in providing sanitation services; and recommend options for \nincreased  involvement,  including  related  institutional,  organizational,  and  financial \nimprovements.  \n \n15.  An assessment of innovative financing schemes for improving urban water supply and \nsanitation will be carried out, including local currency financing, municipal bonds, refinancing \nand restructuring, and public\u2013private partnerships. The PPTA will consider ongoing technical \nassistance from the Philippine Water Revolving Fund, as appropriate, including securitization of \nreceivables, and matters relating to the Agri-Agra Law compliance.10 The PPTA will review and \nassess  options  for  (revolving)  funds  for  financing  water  supply  and  sanitation  connection \ncharges, and related investment components (e.g., household sanitation improvement).11 It will \ndevelop capacity building components, including programs for improving water districts\u2019 financial \nand operational performance, and enhancing their creditworthiness.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the PPTA is estimated at $1.5 million equivalent. The PPTA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership \nFacility12 for $1.2 million, and administered by ADB. The Government will finance the remaining \ncost  amounting  to  $300,000  through  in-kind  contributions,  which  cover  office  and  support \nfacilities, counterpart staff, administrative support, and local transportation for counterpart staff. \nThe Government has been informed that approval of the PPTA does not commit ADB to finance \nany ensuing project. \n                                                 \n10 The  Philippine  Water  Revolving  Fund  aims  to  provide  financing  for  creditworthy  water  districts  and  local \ngovernments for improving water supply services. PD 717 (Agri-Agra Law) of 1975 aims to enhance access to \nfinancing for agriculture.  \n11  The PPTA will include lessons learned from ADB. 2005.

Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The executing agency (EA) for the PPTA will be LWUA, which will establish a project \nmanagement unit (PMU) that will be responsible for organizing the technical and administrative \naspects of the PPTA, and day-to-day decisions affecting its implementation. The PMU will \ninclude  suitably  qualified  and  experienced  counterpart  staff  to  work  alongside  the  PPTA \nconsultants. PMU staff will include a director and 4\u20135 counterpart personnel for engineering, \ninstitutional, and financial matters. The PPTA consultant will provide full support to the head of \nthe PMU and will work in close collaboration with the counterpart team. A steering committee\u2014\nchaired by a representative of the Department of Finance and comprising senior officials from \nLWUA, the National Economic and Development Authority, the Department of Finance, the \nDepartment  of  Public  Works  and  Highways,  the  National  Water  Resources  Board,  the \nDepartment of Health, and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources\u2014will be \nestablished to provide guidance and oversee the PPTA implementation. The steering committee \nwill meet at least every 2 months. \n \n18.  The PPTA will require a total of 92 person-months of consulting services, including \n22 person-months  international  and  70  person-months  national. 13  ADB  will  engage  the \nconsultants through a firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time), using the quality- and cost-based selection method, with \na quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10, and requiring preparation of a full technical proposal.14 LWUA will \nbe responsible for providing the agreed-upon counterpart resources. The proposed outline \nterms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4.  \n \n19.  The PPTA is expected to be implemented over 8 months, commencing in October 2008 \nand ending in May 2009. The consultants will prepare (i) an inception report by the end of month \n1; (ii) an interim report by the end of month 3; (iii) a report on LWUA financial and institutional \nanalysis, and onlending arrangements by the end of month 3; (iv) a draft final report by the end \nof month 6; (v) a final report 1 month after receiving comments; (vi) monthly progress reports \n(2\u20133 pages); and (vii) other reports as may reasonably be required. Tripartite review meetings \nwill be held after inception, at the interim report stage, and at the draft final report stage. All \ndocuments produced will be in English\u2014in paper and electronic format\u2014for the Government \nand ADB. Equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, \nas amended from time to time) and handed over to LWUA upon completion of the PPTA. The \nEA will provide the consultant with suitable office space, office furniture (including a sufficient \nnumber of standard desks, chairs, shelves, and closets), lighting, electricity, air conditioning, \nand access to phone lines. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,200,000  to  the \nGovernment of the Philippines to be financed on a grant basis by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund \nunder the Water Financing Partnership Facility for preparing the Water District Development \nSector Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n13 The consultant team will provide expertise, both international and national, in (i) water supply, (ii) sanitation, \n(iii) water utility management, (iv) financial analysis, (v) economic analysis, and (vi) institutional development; as \nwell as national expertise in (i) social development, (ii) resettlement, (iii) environment, (iv) legal, and (v) public \nhealth. \n14 The quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10 is based on the complexity of the assignment. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact  Assumptions \nAccess to safe water  Water supply service is  Primary data received from  \u2022 Project is implemented as \nsupply and sanitation  continuous, of drinking  Local Water Utilities  designed. \nservices is improved for  water quality, meets  Administration (LWUA) and  \u2022 General political and \nthe population of cities  demand, and is financially  water districts  socioeconomic conditions are \nserved by the participating  sustainable.    stable and favorable. \nwater districts.      \u2022 LWUA implements \nWastewater collection and  Government statistics on  organizational changes. \ntreatment services  water and sanitation  \u2022 Water districts sustain best \nprovided by water districts    practices in water supply and \nare improved and  sanitation services delivery. \nfinancially sustainable.    \nRisks \n\u2022 Depletion of freshwater \nresources \n\u2022 Political interference prevents \nsuccessful implementation \nand financial sustainability. \n \nOutcome    Assumptions \nDesign of the ensuing  Endorsement of Project  Memorandum of  \u2022 LWUA, water districts, and \nloan project agreed upon  Preparatory Technical  understanding  government agencies \nby the Government of the  Assistance (PPTA)    committed to timely and \nPhilippines, and the Asian  reports by LWUA, water  Reports and feedback from  successful Technical \nDevelopment Bank (ADB).  districts, government  LWUA, water districts, and  Assistance completion. \nagencies, and ADB (end  related government agencies   \nof month 8)    Risks \n  \u2022 External events delay \ncompletion and approval of \nthe PPTA. \n \nOutputs    Assumptions \n1.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nThe Project aims to increase access to adequate water supply and sanitation for the urban population, particularly benefiting \nthe urban poor, in accordance with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) strategy in the Philippines, which supports poverty \nreduction through macroeconomic assistance for fiscal consolidation and an improved investment c limate, as well as through \ndirect support for Millennium Development Goal initiatives. The water supply and sanitation sector is in a state of transition \nbecause of sector reforms introduced as a result of devolution and decentralization of sector responsibilities. ADB has \nencouraged a shift from a traditional top\u2013down centralized planning approach to the concept of bottom\u2013up planning and \nextensive local consultation, including training and capacity building of sector agencies in project management and community \ndevelopment.  \nB.    Targeting Classification \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention    Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n \n2.   Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \n \nThe project will look at improving service delivery and expanding water supply and sanitation services provided by water \ndistricts in urban areas outside Metro Manila.  \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  N/A \n \n2.  What resources are allocated in the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA)/due diligence?  \n \nA total of 10 person-months of national consultant services and a provisional sum of $20,000 for the social and environmental \nassessment surveys have been allocated. \n \n3. If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross-subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)?  \n \nThe project will assess the water tariff structure and its impact on connecting the urban poor to an adequate water supply. The \ndesign of the ensuing investment program will be based on affordable and cost recovery water tariffs. \n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from the \nproject?  \n \nThe project will particularly benefit people without access to an adequate water supply in urban areas outside Metro Manila, \nand improve the level of service to all users.  \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project?  \n \nThe project will provide affordable and clean water and sanitation to prospective and existing users. \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project address \nthem?  \n \nHigh connection charges often restrict access to piped water supply for the urban poor. The project team will work with the \nLocal Water Utilities Administration and the water districts to overcome hurdles and to ensure an affordable tariff structure. \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. \n \nThe main stakeholders are the water users, water districts, local governments, and the Local Water Utilities Administration. \n \n2. What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., workshops, \ncommunity mobilization, involvement of nongovernment organizations and community-based organizations, etc.)? \n \nThere will be several public consultation meetings over the course of the project preparation (e.g., workshops, seminars). \nThe project will include household surveys, focus group discussions, and hearings on resettlement and environmental \nissues, as required. \n  \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n     Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n \n4.  Will a consultation and participation (C&P) plan be prepared?    Yes          No    Please explain.  \n \nA C&P will be prepared by the PPTA consultant during the social assessment survey and focus groups discussion to seek \nthe views from the population on the project.

Background and Objectives \n \n1.  The objective of the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) is to design the \nWater District Development Sector Project (WDDSP), which comprises a sector loan project \nagreed upon by the Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA), participating water districts, the \nGovernment of the Philippines (Government), and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The \nPPTA will (i) develop the WDDSP to a level of detail suitable for consideration by ADB for \nfunding;  and  (ii)  prepare  implementation  support  and  institutional  development  programs \naddressing sector reform, governance, and public awareness.  \n \nB.  Scope of Work \n \n2.  The consultant will develop the WDDSP following a consultative process. The project will \nbe prepared in accordance with relevant national legal requirements and standards; and ADB \npolicies and guidelines. It is estimated that a team of international and national consultants will \nbe engaged for a total of 92 person-months (22 person-months international and 70 person-\nmonths national consultant services). The PPTA will be carried out in two phases, which may \npartly overlap. \n \n3.  Phase 1 will last about 3 months and will (i) review the water supply and sanitation \nsector in urban areas outside of Metro Manila; (ii) assess the status of legal and regulatory \nreform;  (iii)  assess  water  districts\u2019  demand  for  financing  water  supply  and  sanitation \ninfrastructure through LWUA and other funding sources; (iv) select suitable water districts for \npilot activities to promote reform in the sector, taking into account their financial status, and \npriority  investment  and  institutional  development  requirements;  (v)  prepare  a  financial  and \ninstitutional  analysis  of  LWUA;  and  (vi)  prepare  an  initial  assessment  of  potential  issues, \nhindrances, and risks. Activities will be complemented by workshops and seminars. Phase 2 will \nlast about 5 months and will include (i) preparation of subproject appraisal reports (SPARs) for \nup to five water districts, (ii) preparing the WDDSP to a level of detail suitable for consideration \nby ADB for funding, (iii) development of implementation and funds-channeling arrangements, \n(iv) preparation of institutional development and capacity building programs, and (v) workshops \nand seminars as applicable. \n \n4.
