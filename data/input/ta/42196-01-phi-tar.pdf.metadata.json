INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the Philippines has asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide capacity development technical assistance (TA) to enhance the skills and knowledge of \nstaff of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), local government units \n(LGUs),  and  communities  regarding  sustainable  watershed,  environment,  and  rural \ninfrastructure  management  and  regarding  diversifying  livelihood  options.  The  fact-finding \nmission during 21\u201324 September 2010 held discussions with officials of the DENR\u2019s Foreign-\nAssisted and Special Projects Office, provincial governments of Misamis Oriental and Bukidnon, \nregional offices of the DENR and the National Economic and Development Authority, and \nrepresentatives of civil society organizations and indigenous people. The government confirmed \nthe scope, impact, outcome, and outputs of the TA, which is included in the ADB country \noperations  and  business  plan,  2010\u20132012  for  the  Philippines.  The  TA  will  strengthen  the \ncapacity of the government and civil society in advance of planned ADB operations in the \nsector.1\u00a0The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Philippine forest ecosystems are known for their diversity and abundance of biological \nresources. Collectively, the watersheds that support the forest ecosystems in the upper river \nbasins (URBs) occupy almost half of the country\u2019s total land area and are home to one in four \nFilipinos.3 These  watersheds  provide  essential  products  and  services  that  benefit  society, \nincluding water, soil, pasture, fuelwood, timber, and non-timber forest products. Well-managed \nwatersheds also provide environmental services that are vital for economic growth. Watersheds \nin  URBs  are  under  continued  threat  of  deterioration  caused  by  deforestation  and  forest \ndegradation resulting from the lack of proper management.   \n \n3.  The main issues identified in URBs that need to be addressed urgently at the basin level, \nincluding in Bukidnon, are (i) insufficient staff competency in LGUs, the DENR, and communities \nin sound watershed land use and rehabilitation planning; (ii) low awareness of conservation \npractices and lack of incentives to protect public goods provided by the river basin; and (iii) the \ndeclining condition of rural infrastructure for lack of sustainable funding mechanisms or capacity \nfor operation and maintenance.  \n \n4.  Bukidnon URB, in Region X, is the project area for this TA for the following reasons: (i) \nThe Bukidnon provincial government provides support for the management of protected areas \nand has set up local enforcement programs to control illegal logging, which are responsibilities \ntraditionally held by the DENR. (ii) Bukidnon has a track record of developing health-care and \nhousing services as self-sustaining local enterprises and is interested in doing the same with a \nURB  management  program.  (iii)  The  TA  can  serve  as  a  model,  with  provincial  officials \nmentoring their peers in the other provinces. (iv) Lessons can be learned from the Mount \nKitanglad Range Natural Park, which is considered the most successfully managed protected \narea in the country and is home to four groups of indigenous people, whose livelihoods are \nclosely tied to the river basin and thus will provide examples of good practices and lessons for \n                                                 \n1  The ADB project pipeline includes (i) Integrated Natural Resources Environment Management Project. and (ii) \nAgusan River Basin Management Project.   \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 25 October 2010. \n3  ADB. 2008. Policy Study on River Basin Management in the Philippines. Manila (ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance \nto the Republic of the Philippines for a Master Plan for the Agusan River basin. Manila). \n \n ", "2    \nadopting and retrofitting indigenous knowledge for river basin improvement and watershed co-\nmanagement. \n\u00a0 \u00a0\n5.  Constraints on effective environmental and natural resource management in the DENR, \nLGUs, and communities include the following: \n(i)  Lack  of  an  efficient  decision-support  system. Basic data and information \nconcerning the environment and natural resources that are needed for watershed \nplanning  and  management  are  often  incomplete,  inaccessible  to  watershed \nstakeholders, and outdated. Moreover, monitoring systems to collect and track \ndata related to changes in water and land-use patterns or water and soil quality \nare limited. \n(ii)  Technical capacity and funding constraints. The technical skills of national \ngovernment personnel are still predominantly for natural resource utilization, not \nenvironmental  conservation.  LGUs  have  limited  numbers  of  trained  staff  to \ndeliver  basic  services  or  manage  the  environment  and  natural  resources. \nHowever,  LGU  officials  are  supposed  to  advise  upland  communities  on \nsustainable livelihood and small business development, technology transfer for \npostharvest management, market opportunities, and access to credit. LGUs need \nto  improve  their  civil  engineering  capacity  for  designing,  operating,  and \nmaintaining  such  rural  infrastructure  as  farm-to-market  roads,  bridges,  and \nmarketplaces, as well as their capacity on issues of inclusion. They need to \neducate themselves and the public\u2014in particular women\u2019s groups, indigenous \ngroups, volunteer organizations, and youth groups\u2014on the issues and threats of \nclimate change.  \n \n6.  Ensuring inclusive development is a key aspect of this project. First, indigenous people \ncomprise 60% of the project area population, and special attention is required to protect their \nheritage and livelihoods, making their involvement crucial for watershed rehabilitation. Second, \nwhile the Philippines has a strong legal and policy framework for protecting and promoting \nwomen's rights, a country gender assessment indicated that the implementation of policies is \npatchy and slow.4 Most women and indigenous people are engaged in agriculture and forestry, \nso  ensuring  their  full  participation  and  representation  in  development  initiatives  is  crucial. \nIndigenous and other women in the project area participate actively in safeguarding natural \nresources and in agricultural production. Their participation so far does not always translate into \nmaking them capable, empowered, and involved in planning or decision-making in regard to \nland-use planning, improving access to markets and credit, or interventions and investments in \nenterprises for environmental management and natural resource management. \n \n7.  The TA will support capacity development in the DENR, LGUs, and communities toward \nresolving the weaknesses outlined above and will support the government\u2019s new vision for \nagriculture and natural resources anticipated for inclusion in its medium-term development plan, \n2011\u20132016. The TA is in line with the draft Philippine country partnership strategy, 2010\u20132015  \nand agriculture and natural resources sector thrusts.5 The project is consistent with the themes \n                                                 \n4 The summary draws on ADB. 2008. Paradox and Promise in the Philippines: A Joint Country Gender Assessment. \nManila. A longer summary is available at http://www.adb.org/Documents/Reports/Country-Gender-\nAssessments/cga-phi-2008.pdf.  \n5  The  draft  ADB  agriculture  and  natural  resources  assessment  for  the  Philippines  prepared  for  the  country \npartnership strategy proposes a sector focus on increasing income and productivity in rural communities with the \nsustainable management and use  of land,  water, forest, and coastal resources. ADB  will support (i) rural \ninfrastructure (irrigation, farm-to-market roads, postharvest facilities, and water supply systems); (ii) integrated \nnatural resources management; (iii) public sector management in the agriculture and natural resources sector, \n ", "  3\nof inclusive and environmentally sustainable growth as articulated in ADB\u2019s long-term strategy \n2020 and includes activities in the crosscutting issues of gender equality and climate change6. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  sustainable  increases  in  rural  household  incomes  in \nBukidnon based on natural resources. The outcome will be LGUs and communities capable of \nplanning and investing in sustainable watershed management. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The  TA  will  have  three  outputs  that  will  be  implemented  by  LGUs  together  with \nconsultants,  nongovernment  organizations  that  train,  and  community  groups:  (i)  selected \nBukidnon URBs profiled and their capacity for participatory watershed planning enhanced; (ii) \nBukidnon  LGUs\u2019  capacity  for  rural  infrastructure  planning,  operation,  and  maintenance \nstrengthened; and (iii) the LGUs\u2019 and Bukidnon URB communities\u2019 knowledge of livelihood \noptions based on sustainable watershed management increased. The TA will be implemented \nusing  the  following  methods:  (i)  cross  learning  and  exposure  to  watershed  management, \nagroforestry, and enterprise and business development; (ii) mentoring for volunteer youths, \nwomen, and indigenous groups in such activities as preparing ecological profiles and data \ncollection; (iii) a series of workshops and training activities designed following the assessment of \ncapacity-development needs; and (iv) orientation and dialogue on climate change adaptation \nand mitigation and the introduction of innovative markets to address climate change challenges.  \n \n10.   The  TA  will  distill  lessons  learned  and  good  practices  of  government,  ADB,7 and \ndevelopment partners\u2019 activities.8  The TA will further enhance relevant knowledge and training \nby facilitating the merging of top\u2013down and bottom\u2013up planning approaches to support LGUs \nand inclusive community-driven development initiatives. In line with government policy, the \ndecentralized  framework  adopted  in  this  TA  will  encourage  the  participation  of  LGUs  and \ncommunities  (including  volunteer  groups,  women\u2019s  groups,  and  indigenous  people)  in \nwatershed planning, rural infrastructure operation and maintenance, and the introduction of \nclimate change adaptation and mitigation. \n \n11.  Key activities as per outputs are as follows: \n                                                                                                                                                          \nincluding  results-based  management  and  networking  capacity  development;  (iv)  participatory  approaches  to \nplanning, design, implementation, operation, and maintenance; (v) integrated water resources management and \nbasin development; (vi) alternative livelihood opportunities to stop the inappropriate use of natural resources; and \n(vii) the mainstreaming of climate change in the design of facilities and interventions. \n6 ADB. 2008.

The \necological  profiles  will  summarize  existing  information  on  the  ecological \nstructures and functions of the ecosystems, including the carrying capacity of the \nbasin,  deforestation,  and  flood  and  landslide  frequency.  The  TA  will  deliver \ncapacity  building  through  stakeholders\u2019  workshops  for  assessing  existing \necological conditions. Profiles will include socioeconomic mapping of the target \narea.  Indigenous  people  and  gender  perspectives  will  be  documented  as \nknowledge products for this output. \n(ii)  The TA will promote a participatory approach to designing rural infrastructure, co-\nmanaged by the community and LGUs, and address the main constrains on the \noperation and maintenance of rural infrastructure such as lack of ownership, \nunwillingness to pay, inadequate dues and collection rates,9 and the lack of \nroutine maintenance programs with counterpart funding. Basic training will be \nconducted  on  the  principles  and  practices  of  designing,  operating,  and \nmaintaining rural infrastructure in a manner sensitive to gender and indigenous \npeople\u2019s  concerns.  Adequate  and  functional  rural  infrastructure  is  crucial  for \nsupporting  sustainable  livelihoods,  enterprise  development,  and  enhanced \nnatural  resource  management,  such  as  by  the  proposed  Integrated  Natural \nResources  and  Environmental  Management  Project  (footnote  1).  Training  of \ntrainers will include the careful selection of participants with the objective of \nsustaining the knowledge and skills of local staff and communities in managing \nrural infrastructure. \n(iii)  Livelihood-related  activity  will  improve  technical  knowledge  of  agroforestry, \nfarming systems, and marketing in LGUs and communities to support sustainable \nlivelihoods in Bukidnon URB. The approaches used by other agencies\u2019 livelihood \ninitiatives will be reviewed, and training materials and methods will be adjusted \naccordingly. Intensive training and dialogue will be provided to primary trainers. \nThese primary trainers will cascade knowledge along and across administrative \nlevels and sectors in LGUs. A mentoring program will be prepared for women, \nindigenous  people,  youths,  and  volunteer  groups.  The  outputs  will  be  12 \nproposals.  Orientation  for  climate  change  adaptation  and  mitigation  will  be \nprepared  and  delivered  through  seminars,  dialogue,  and  the  sharing  of \ninformation on good practices.    \n \n12.   The activities in output (i) provide a core capacity base for watershed management \nplanning.  Activities  under  outputs  (ii)  and  (iii)  address  the  key  issues  that  will  facilitate \nsustainable  livelihoods,  i.e.,  functioning  rural  infrastructure  and  stakeholders\u2019  technical \nknowledge and skills. LGUs will work together and be supported by consultants and existing \ntraining institutions in executing activities and delivering outputs. Emphasis will be placed on \ncooperation, learning, and activities complementary with those of other agencies working with \nsimilar objectives in the areas.  \n13.   Special  features  of  this  TA  will  focused  on  gender  and  indigenous  people\u2019s \nperspectives  on  sustainably  managing  watersheds  and  natural  resources  and  developing \nknowledge products. A gender action plan will include comprehensive coverage of all capacity-\n                                                 \n9  Project Performance Audit Report on Second Palawan Integrated Area Development Project, Manila (December); \nProject Completion Mission Review, Upland Development Program, Project No. 2004/107776, European Union, \nHTSPE Ltd., Completion Evaluation on Cordillera Highland Agricultural Resources Management Project, IFAD, \nJuly 2007. \n ", "  5\ndevelopment  and  technical  activities  to  ensure  that  they  benefit  women  in  terms  of \nempowerment and participation in decision-making on natural resource management, including \nimproved access to technical training and other activities to improve their livelihoods. Similar \nactivities will ensure that indigenous people\u2019s perspectives and concerns are considered in all \nactivities. Knowledge products will result from collecting data and preparing and publishing \nreports  and  manuals  with  innovative  ideas  and  practices  related  to  natural  resource \nmanagement  and  the  three  components  of  the  TA.  To  ensure  the  effective  use  and \ndissemination  of  the  knowledge  products,  a  communication  and  knowledge  plan  will  be \nprepared and reviewed.   \n \nC.   Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $1,430,000 equivalent of which $1,300,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR), and administered \nby ADB. The Government of the Philippines will finance the remaining $130,000 equivalent with \ncontributions  in  kind  of  office  accommodation,  transport,  remuneration  and  per  diem  of \ncounterpart staff, and other facilities for the project implementation. The detailed cost estimate \nand financing plan is in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.   Implementation Arrangements \n15.
