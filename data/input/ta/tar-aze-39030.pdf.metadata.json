In 2004, the transport sector accounted for 7% of Azerbaijan\u2019s gross domestic product \n(GDP),1 and its importance to the country\u2019s growing economy is steadily increasing. The sector \ncontributes significantly to regional cooperation, and facilitates the development of international \ntrade and transit traffic. As part of the famed silk route, Azerbaijan offers the most feasible \npassage connecting Central Asia and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) with Europe.  \nWith  its  rapidly  developing  pipeline  infrastructure,  Azerbaijan  also  plays  a  critical  role  in \ntransporting  oil  and  oil  products  from  the  Caspian  Sea  to  the  Black  Sea  and  Europe.  \nThe transport sector is crucial to the domestic economy as it links the rural population with \nurban  and  international  markets.  More  effective  transport  infrastructure  can  improve  the \neconomy and reduce poverty.  \n2.  The growing demand for freight transport is met by railways (35%), sea (30%), roads \n(28%), and pipeline (7%). Domestic passenger traffic uses roads (78%), air (9%), metro (8%), \nand railways (5%). Air transport is used primarily for international travel, and to access the \nNakhichevan region which is separated from Azerbaijan due to past conflicts with Armenia.2 \nNakhichevan is accessible by road through Iran.  \n3.  Despite healthy GDP growth in recent years, fueled by increasing income from the oil \nand gas sectors, poverty remains widespread due to political issues and conflicts in the early \nyears  of  independence.3  In  2001,  the  Government  initiated  the  State  Program  on  Poverty \nReduction and Economic Development (SPPRED). The poverty reduction strategy outlined in \nthe SPPRED include, among others, improvement of road infrastructure. The rapid growth of \nthe  oil  and  gas sectors,  and  the consequent  decline  in  agricultural  and  industrial  sectors, \nchanged the demand for transport. Improved roads could help reduce poverty by providing \naccess  to  the  rural  poor  ensuring  more  balanced  development.  In  addition,  policy  and \ninstitutional reforms, combined with planned infrastructure development in the transport sector, \nwould encourage private sector participation, leading to job opportunities and poverty reduction. \n4.  The Government has requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) for the transport sector development strategy. The TA4 was not included in ADB\u2019s \ncountry strategy and program update 2005\u20132006 for Azerbaijan,5 as it was identified later. It is \nnow part of the revised 2005 loan and TA program. Management has approved the concept \npaper for the TA. The Fact-Finding Mission visited Azerbaijan 5\u20139 February 2005 to formulate \nthe TA. The Mission reached agreement with the Government on the objectives, scope, cost \nestimates, financing plan, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference for consultants \nfor the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  The  Government  has  prioritized  the  development  of  the  two  major  road  transport \ncorridors. The East-West corridor is part of the famed silk route connecting the PRC and Central \nAsia to Europe. The North-South corridor connects Baku to the Russian Federation in the north, \nand to Iran and beyond in the south. With assistance from international financial institutions \n                                                 \n1  Based on 2004 figures in the Azerbaijan Monthly Statistical Review 2005. \n2  The conflicts occurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  \n3  The incidence of poverty was 46.7% in 2002. The figure was higher in urban areas. \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 18 February 2005. \n5  ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program Update (2005\u20132006): Azerbaijan. Manila. \n ", "2 \n(IFIs),6 financing for improving the East-West corridor is nearly complete. Negotiations are under \nway with IFIs for the northern (Baku-Russian border) section of the North-South corridor.7  \nFor the southern section (Baku-Iranian border), the Government has reached an understanding \nwith Iran for partial funding, and is seeking assistance from ADB and other IFIs. The Road \nTransport Service Department (RTSD)8 is keen to upgrade these transport corridors to category \nI (dual carriageway with four lanes) in anticipation of heavy international and transit traffic.  \nThe Government is aware of the need to improve the secondary and tertiary road infrastructure \nthat provides in-country links, as well as access and opportunities to the large rural population. \nRoad infrastructure development plans should be linked closely to appropriate policy reforms to \n(i) rationalize road-user charges and maintenance funding, (ii) ensure effective maintenance \noperations, (iii) control vehicle overloading, (iv) minimize environment and social impacts, and \n(v) enhance road safety.9 \n \n6.  The large Azerbaijan State Railway (ASR) network of about 3,000 kilometers once \noperated effectively as part of the Russian railway system. However, it has suffered since \nindependence due to a lack of adequate maintenance facilities and spare parts. The rolling \nstock is similarly affected. ASR is planning to rehabilitate the track, and replace or restore the \nrolling  stock.  The  European  Union,  under  its  program  for  Transport  Corridor  Europe-the \nCaucasus-Asia  (TRACECA),  and  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development \n(EBRD) are providing TA and financing for investment projects to improve rolling stock and \nmaintenance  facilities.  The  Government  is  considering  upgrading  the  tracks  to  European \nstandards to enable trains to operate across borders. The current conditions are not conducive \nfor  efficient  operations,  resulting  in  lower  income  and  financial  constraints.  Private  sector \nparticipation in passenger operations should be considered, as well as reliance on market \nprinciples for tariff policies. Though railway freight operations are dominated by oil and oil \nproducts, ASR insists that demand will not slacken when the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline \nbecomes operational in 2005.  \n \n7.  National carrier Azerbaijan Airlines, which operates on a commercial basis, dominates \nair transport. It is planning a major expansion of its operations. Though a few private airlines are \nin business, their operations are restricted by laws governing air transport.10 The Government is \nreviewing legislation aimed at reducing these restrictions to allow private airlines to operate \nmore freely under a regulatory framework. The Government also is using its own resources to \nrehabilitate and upgrade major airports, including terminal buildings, runways, traffic control and \nair navigation facilities, and security.    \n \n8.  State-owned Caspian Shipping monopolizes sea transport and operates independently. \nThe Government is planning a major expansion of its operations, including the addition of large \noil tankers. The Baku International Port is an autonomous entity responsible for the operation, \nmaintenance,  and  development  of  four  major  terminals.  The  TRACECA  program  provides \n                                                 \n6  The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Islamic Development Bank, Kuwait Fund, World \nBank, Saudi Fund, and ADB are the major development partners in the road subsector. \n7  EBRD, Czech EXIM Bank, and Bank National Paribas. \n8  RTSD is responsible for developing and maintaining the major road network in Azerbaijan. \n9  The ongoing World Bank-financed Highway Rehabilitation Project (approved in 2001) includes TA for institutional \nstrengthening and capacity building in the road subsector. Specifically, the TA includes road inventory and \nclassification, planning and management, technical standards and/or specifications, financial management, quality \nassurance system, traffic safety, and performance assessment. The proposed ADB-financed East-West Road \nCorridor  Improvement  Project,  which  the  Board  is  expected  to  consider  this  year,  includes  an  institutional \nstrengthening component covering road maintenance, axle load control, road safety, environmental and social \nmanagement, and project management. \n10 The Transport Law was enacted on 11 June 1999. \n ", "    3 \nassistance for technical support, capacity building, development of port facilities, and provision \nof port equipment. The Ministry of Transport (MOT) reports that the port needs communications, \nnavigational, and search-and-rescue facilities. \n \n9.  Urban road transport is fully privatized as almost all public bus and trucks are private-\nowned. However, the transport fleets are outdated, and modern vehicles need to be introduced \nto  improve  operational  efficiency  and  reduce  pollution.  The  city-owned  underground  metro \nserves  about  26%  of  the  Baku  population.  Like  the  railways,  however,  its  performance  is \ndeclining due to the lack of maintenance facilities and spare parts. Resource constraints restrict \nthe much-needed rehabilitation and expansion necessary to overcome traffic congestion and \npollution.  \n \n10.  All  transport-related  ancillary  services,  including  freight  forwarders,  are  private.  \nThe Freight Forwarders Association is well established, and quite effective in dealing with the \nGovernment. Privatization is high on the Government\u2019s reform agenda for the transport sector. \nThe Government has adopted a gradual approach whereby state-owned enterprises (railway, \nairline, and shipping) initially will be restructured as joint stock companies. The Government is \nseparating the regulatory and commercial functions of Azerbaijan Airline and Caspian Shipping. \nThe regulatory mechanisms and legislation are being prepared. This process will allow the \nestablishment of regulatory institutions and will promote greater private sector involvement, \nincluding investment in transport infrastructure. \n \n11.  Because  of  its  location,  Azerbaijan  is  the  focal  point  for  international  transit  trade \nbetween the PRC, Central Asia, and Europe. It also connects Europe to the Middle East.  \nThe  Government  is  signatory  to  a  number  of  bilateral  and  multilateral  agreements  with \nneighboring  countries  and  international  organizations  for  facilitating  international  transport \nthrough Azerbaijan. To monitor international transit traffic, the Government plans to develop a \nlogistics center. \n \n12.  Due  to  steady  economic  growth  and  changing  needs  in  the  transport  sector,  the \ninstitutional requirements continue to evolve. The Government has launched several initiatives \nto reform institutions, including establishing MOT. However, improvements in human resource \ncapacity  in  the  transport  sector  must  accompany  these  changes.  Government  officials, \nconstruction and consulting firms, transport operators, and consumers have limited knowledge \nof (i) transport policies and regulations needed for a market economy, (ii) management of \ncommercial transport operations, (iii) new technologies in construction and maintenance of \ntransport infrastructure, and (iv) methodologies for evaluating transport investment projects. \nAppropriate measures are needed to strengthen human resource capacity in the sector. \n \n13.  The Government is preparing a 10-year program for transport sector development, and \nis keen for ADB\u2019s assistance in this area. MOT feels that giving its staff an opportunity to work \nwith international experts will develop much-needed capacity in transport planning, and this will \ngo a long way in enabling MOT to develop transport sector plans indigenously. The proposed \nTA will help MOT achieve this objective. Three aspects will be critical in formulating the strategy. \nFirst,  public  consultations  are  necessary  to  ensure  strategy  relevance  and  effectiveness. \nSecond, the strategy will adopt a multimodal transport approach, and provide directions for \nfuture activities from the perspective of an integrated transport sector rather than individual \nmodes of transport. Third, a link between the strategy and resources is fundamental to success. \nThe new transport strategy will identify future sector priorities and their financing requirements \nfor which must be reflected in the Government's medium-term fiscal framework. \n \n ", "4 \n14.  The  implementation  period  for  SPPRED  ends  in  2005.  The  Government  plans  to \ndevelop a 10-year national poverty reduction strategy that will focus on achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment  Goals  (MDGs).11  The  schedule  for  preparing  the  transport  sector  strategy \ncoincides with this effort, allowing the development of appropriate links with the national poverty \nreduction strategy. These links will enhance the impact of transport sector development on \npoverty reduction.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Output \n15.  The goal of the TA is to improve transport sector performance so that it can make a \nsustainable  contribution  to  economic  development  and  poverty  reduction  in  Azerbaijan.  \nThe purpose of the TA is to assess in detail all modes of transport, and identify strategic \npriorities and resources for sector development and operational needs for the medium term in \nline with the Government\u2019s objectives. The strategy will be the Government\u2019s key document \nguiding the policies and investments in the transport sector in 2006\u20132016. The TA will help \ndevelop the country strategy and program12 for Azerbaijan, and will guide ADB assistance for \nlending and nonlending products and services in the transport sector.    \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n16.  International consultants, supported by domestic consultants, will be engaged to help the \nGovernment prepare the transport strategy. The consultants will work closely with MOT staff, \nand provide on-the-job training to develop skills and ensure strategy review and revisions.  \nThe TA will involve analytical and innovative research, fieldwork, training, and stakeholder \nconsultations  with  the  Government,  civil  society,  the  private  sector,  user  groups,  and \ninternational development partners. \n \n17.  Key TA activities include (i) undertaking an analytical review of the status of the transport \nsector, and preparing a transport sector update; (ii) reviewing the development plans for civil \naviation,  railways,  roads,  maritime  transport,  ports  and/or  harbors,  oil  pipeline,  and  urban \ntransport;  (iii)  identifying  the  long-term  development  needs,  policy  reforms,  and  regulatory \nrequirements that are in line with the Government\u2019s envisaged development goals; (iv) advising \nthe Government on establishing a logistics center for international transit traffic, (v) consulting \nwith stakeholders through at least two workshops\u2014the first in the initial implementation period, \nand the second to discuss the draft strategy; (vi) identifying MOT capacity-building needs, and \nundertaking  and/or  arranging  selected  training;  and  (vii)  preparing  the  medium-term \n(2006\u22122016) transport sector development strategy, covering the roles of Government, private \nsector, and regulatory bodies.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The estimated cost of the TA is $437,500 equivalent, including foreign exchange cost of \n$225,000 and local currency cost of $212,500. The detailed cost estimate is in Appendix 2. ADB \nwill finance $350,000 equivalent, including the foreign exchange cost of $225,000 and local \ncurrency cost of $125,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA \n                                                 \n11 ADB plans to assist through a proposed TA for participatory strategy development and implementation for \nachieving the MDGs. \n12 Scheduled for 2006. \n ", "    5 \nfund program. The Government will finance the remaining local currency cost of $87,500 by \nproviding office space, counterpart staff, and administrative support. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  MOT will be the Executing Agency. A steering committee, chaired by the deputy minister \nof MOT, will be established to oversee implementation, provide guidance and direction, and \nfacilitate coordination and cooperation among the subsectors and stakeholders. The committee \nwill include representatives of agencies responsible for planning and developing roads, railways, \ncivil  aviation,  maritime  transport,  ports  and  harbors,  oil  pipelines,  and  urban  transport. \nRepresentatives of the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economic Development, State Customs \nCommittee, Traffic Police, and other relevant agencies also will attend the steering committee \nmeetings. MOT will establish task forces in each subsector agency to ensure that information \nrelevant to the subsector is readily available to the consultants. \n \n20.  The TA will require 42.5 person-months of consulting services, comprising 9.5 person-\nmonths of international consulting and 33.0 person-months of domestic consulting input to carry \nout  the  terms  of  reference  (Appendix  3).  The  team  of  consultants  from  an  international \nconsulting firm, in association with domestic consultants, will be engaged using ADB\u2019s quality \nand cost-based selection procedures, and according to the ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  selecting  and  engaging  the \ndomestic consultants. The international specialists will include (i) a transport planner, (ii) a \nrailway specialist, (iii) a border control logistic specialist, and (iv) a financial and/or institutional \nspecialist. The domestic input will include specialists for (i) roads, (ii) railways, (iii) civil aviation, \n(iv) maritime and/or ports, (v) financial, (vi) urban transport, (vii) logistics, (viii) engineer and/or \nplanner, (ix) communications, and (x) economist. The TA is expected to start in July 2005, and \nwill  be  completed  by  December  2005.  The  consultants  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement in procuring equipment, supplies, and materials. The equipment will be turned \nover to MOT after TA completion. \n \nIV.
