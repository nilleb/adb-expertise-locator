THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  to  Mongolia  for  the  Western  Regional  Road  Corridor \nInvestment Program.1 \n \n2.  The outputs of the investment program will be (i) completion of the western regional road \n(293 km of roads to be constructed), (ii) three maintenance units established and equipped, \n(iii) 34.9 km of local roads and three bridges rehabilitated to connect provincial and district \ncenters to the western regional road, and (iv) improved capacity of road institutions.2 \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Mongolia is a large, sparsely populated country located between the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC) to the south, and the Russian Federation to the north. Due to the large land area, \nlow population density, and severe weather conditions during winter, surface transportation in \nMongolia is difficult. Paved roads account for just over 5% of the total road network with the \nmajority of roads only dirt tracks. The route of the proposed western regional road corridor, which \nis part of Asian Highway 4 and is designated Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation \n(CAREC) Corridor 4a, runs north\u2013south from Mongolia\u2019s border with the Russian Federation at \nUlaanbayshint to its border with the PRC at Yarant, a total distance of about 743 kilometers (km). \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) is supporting the development of 111 km of the corridor \nthrough the Western Regional Road Corridor Development Project\u2013Phase I (phase I).3 The PRC \nis financing 145 km of the corridor, while the Government of Mongolia is developing 194 km. The \nremaining 293 km of road is proposed to be developed under the investment program. \n \n4.  Mongolia\u2019s western region suffers from slow development because of its remoteness \nfrom the country\u2019s political and economic centers and its inadequate transport network. Roads \nto and within the region are mostly unpaved and impose heavy travel costs on residents and \nvisitors. As a result, the region lacks adequate access to jobs, markets, and social services, and \nis significantly poorer than other parts of Mongolia. Gross domestic product per capita in the \nwestern region is only 75% of the national average. The poverty incidence was 48% in 2008, \ncompared with the national average of 34%. Due to their proximity to the PRC and the Russian \nFederation,  Bayan-Olgiy  and  Khovd  provinces  import  about  75%  of  their  energy,  food, \nconsumer goods, and construction materials from the two countries. \n \n5.  Lack of paved roads results in high transport costs and long travel times. The investment \nprogram is the government\u2019s top priority road investment after the ADB-financed Regional Road \nDevelopment Project.4 A functioning paved road network will help Mongolia to link together its \nlarge and poorly connected territory to promote social and economic development. While the \nwestern region is sparsely populated, it is home to 185,000 people, who currently have no \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Technical \nAssistance Grant to Mongolia for the Regional Road Development Project. Manila. The regional road corridor runs \nnorth\u2013south from the border with the Russian Federation at Altanbulag, through the national capital Ulaanbaatar, to \nthe border with the PRC at Zamyn-Uud.  ", "2 \npaved road access to regional cities and towns. The investment program will provide a vital link \nto economic opportunities and social services, reduce the high costs of imports, and improve \nthe competitiveness of the region\u2019s export products. \n \n6.  Cross-border transport. Mongolia\u2019s western regional road corridor can also serve as a \ndirect and convenient transit route between the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of the PRC \nand the Russian Federation, reducing transport costs and facilitating trade, tourism, and other \neconomic  activities.  Rising  incomes  will  increase  the  demand  for  imports  from  neighboring \ncountries, which are now constrained due to extremely high transport costs. Efficient cross-border \ntransport will be essential for the western regional road to deliver the envisioned benefits. ADB is \nassisting the PRC to improve cross-border transport in the region through the Xinjiang Altay \nUrban  Infrastructure  and  Environment  Improvement  Project, 6 which  includes  infrastructure \nimprovements at the Takeshiken land port on the PRC side of the border near Yarant. \n \n7.  Trade  and  regional  transport  is  hindered  by  the  lack  of  cross-border  transport \nagreements.  Mongolia  has  an  existing  cross-border  transport  agreement  with  the  Russian \nFederation allowing reciprocal access to each country\u2019s vehicles. In practice, Russian trucks \nrarely travel south of Olgiy due to the poor road conditions. On the PRC side, Mongolian \nvehicles generally cannot travel past Takeshiken, near the border, and vehicles from the PRC \ncan  only  travel  to  designated  locations  in  Mongolia;  usually  to  deliver  materials  for  road \nconstruction. No trilateral transit system covers movements between the PRC, Mongolia, and \nthe Russian Federation. Given the importance of transit agreements to Mongolia, a component \non  a  cross-border  road  transport  facilitation  plan  was  included  under  the  Regional  Road \nDevelopment Project, which is now under implementation  (footnote 4). Further support for \ntransport and trade facilitation is being provided through regional TA.7 \n \n8.  Lessons from prior road projects. Road projects in Mongolia have experienced cost \noverruns  and  delays  in  implementation.  Cost  overruns  were  primarily  the  result  of  large \nworldwide commodity price increases during 2007\u20132008, and the lack of recent bid prices upon \nwhich  to  base  road  construction  cost  estimates.  The  Regional  Road  Development  Project \nrequired supplementary financing in 2008 to cover cost overruns.8 The phase I project has \nlikewise  experienced  cost  increases  for  which  the  government  has  requested  additional \nfinancing  (para.  13).  ADB  has  taken  steps  to  prevent  cost  overruns  under  the  proposed \ninvestment program through extensive due diligence on the detailed design and cost estimates. \nAll estimates are now based on recent bid prices from the phase I project. In addition, the \nrevised cost estimates incorporate large contingencies to account for potential inflation impacts.  \n \n9.  Past implementation delays were caused by problems with (i) preparing bid documents, \n(ii) evaluating  bids,  (iii)  preparing  bid  evaluation  reports,  and  (iv) preparing  acceptable \nwithdrawal applications. ADB intends to address the implementation problems with a multi-\nfaceted capacity development effort that will provide international consultancy support to the \ngovernment and project implementation units (PIUs). This will directly assist with, and provide \non-the-job training in, every aspect of procurement, project management, and implementation \nfor the duration of the first tranche implementation period. \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2011.

Justification for financing modality. The investment program represents an expansion \nof over 20% of the entire paved road network in Mongolia, which will require a medium- to long-\nterm commitment by ADB to assist the government in completing the road corridor. The cost of \ncompleting the remaining sections of the western regional road is estimated at $262 million, \nwhich is significantly more than ADB has been able to provide under a single loan to the \ntransport sector in Mongolia.9 At the same time, the full benefits of the road\u2014particularly for \nlong-distance and transit traffic and to spur new economic development opportunities\u2014will only \nbe realized once the road corridor is complete. The MFF modality allows ADB to include the full \nscope of the road under the investment program and align its financing with the government\u2019s \nability to implement the investment program. The MFF will allow the government to proceed as \nquickly as its expanding access to ADB and other resources10 and implementation progress \npermit. \n \n11.  Policy framework and road map. To play its part in the rapid expansion of Mongolia\u2019s \ntransport network, the road subsector needs capacity development and modernization. ADB has \nhad extensive dialogue with the government to formulate a sector road map and capacity \ndevelopment  strategy.11 This  road  map  establishes  medium-  and  long-term  performance \nobjectives  for  the  road  subsector  and  draws  up  a  series  of  targets  and  actions  to  be \nimplemented. To support the implementation of priority reforms and build capacity, ADB has \napproved capacity development TA to be implemented in parallel with the proposed MFF.12 The \nTA will assist the government to implement the initial phase of the road map. Road map \nimplementation targets are incorporated as government undertakings for the MFF. \n \n12.  Strategic context. The investment program addresses ADB\u2019s strategic goals13 in the \ntransport  sector  to  (i)  foster  regional  integration  by  reducing  transport  and  logistics  costs; \n(ii) improve  sector  institutions,  management,  human  capacity,  and  asset  sustainability;  and \n(iii) develop and improve regional and international transport corridors, including the completion \nof corridor 4a in the CAREC transport program. The investment program objectives are fully \nconsistent with the strategic goals articulated in the country partnership strategy.14 \n \n13.  Investment  program.  The  physical  elements  of  the  investment  program  include \n(i) completing  the  western  regional  road,  which  has  long  been  part  of  Mongolia\u2019s  national \ndevelopment strategy, (ii) linking small villages and towns to the main corridor to spread the \nbenefits of the investment to regional population centers, and (iii) establishing road maintenance \ncenters to improve asset management and sustainability. Nonphysical components include \ncapacity development in the road subsector, support for local contractors, extensive on-the-job \ntraining in project management and implementation, and sector reform initiatives adopted in the \nroad map and implemented through coordination and performance links between the MFF and \n                                                 \n9  The country operations business plan reports that transport sector lending is expected to average about $38 million \nper year during 2010\u20132012, representing nearly 60% of all ADB lending to Mongolia. \n10 Mongolia received ADB Board approval on 16 August 2011 to access ordinary capital resources under the ADB\u2019s \nGraduation Policy. \n11 ADB. 2010.

The link between the MFF physical investments and the sector road map \nimplementation will provide strong incentives for sector development and reform. \n \n14.  Additional financing. The phase I project now under implementation has experienced \ncost overruns as a result of price escalation, leaving one section of the road without sufficient \nfinancing. The government has requested additional financing for that section, through tranche 1 \nof the proposed MFF. The request meets ADB\u2019s requirements for additional financing15 through \nan  MFF.16 Therefore,  tranche  1  of  the  proposed  investment  program  includes  additional \nfinancing to complete the phase I project. The remaining sections of the phase I project are \nproceeding satisfactorily. The road section receiving supplementary financing will be completed \nwithin 3 years of the grant closing date for phase I. The investment program remains consistent \nwith the phase I project\u2019s development objectives. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n15.  The impact of the investment program will be inclusive economic growth promoted by \nenhanced  local  and  regional  connectivity  in  the  remote  western  region  of  Mongolia.  The \noutcome will be improved transport accessibility within the project area and between countries. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n16.  Project 1. Outputs to be financed under project 1 will be (i) 103.3 km of paved road \nconstructed between Baga Ulaan Davaa and Mankhan, (ii) one maintenance center established \nand equipped, (iii) 20 km of local access road constructed between district centers and the \nwestern regional road, and (iv) capacity development for maintenance planning, and works, \nprocurement, and project management. \n \n17.  Project 2. Outputs to be financed under project 2 are expected to be (i) 103.9 km of \npaved  road  constructed  between  Khovd  provincial  center  and  Khashaatiin  Davaa,  (ii)  one \nmaintenance  center  established  and  equipped,  (iii)  two  bridges  and  10  km  of  local  road \nrehabilitated in Khovd provincial center, between the western regional road and the airport, and \n(iv) additional and ongoing support for capacity development and reform in the road subsector, \nwhich will be identified in the TA (footnote 12). \n \n18.  Project 3. Outputs to be financed under project 3 are expected to be (i) 44 km of road \nbetween Khashaatiin Davaa and Buraatiin Davaa, 16 km of paved road constructed between \nBuraatiin Davaa and Tolbo District, and 25.8 km of paved road constructed between Tsaganuur \nand Ulaanbayshint; (ii) one maintenance unit established and equipped; (iii) one bridge and 4.9 \nkm of local road rehabilitated in Olgiy provincial center, linking to the western regional road; and \n(iv) additional and ongoing support for capacity development and reform in the road subsector, \nwhich will be finalized during the implementation of the work under project 2. \n \n                                                 \n15 As required under the Operations Manual section on additional financing, the project remains technically feasible, \neconomically viable, and financially sound.

The \nrequirements for limited supplementary financing through an MFF are addressed in the Additional Financing \nAssessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \nD.  Special Features \n \n19.  Previous externally financed road construction projects, including those supported by \nADB, have relied on foreign contractors for civil works, limiting the development of the local road \ncontracting industry. A viable local road contracting industry is essential to ensure that the \ncountry has the capacity to maintain the existing and planned roads, as well as to support new \nconstruction. The MFF provides an opportunity to raise the capacity and quality of local road \ncontractors so that they can produce an increasing share of road construction work and play a \nleading role in the ongoing maintenance of Mongolia\u2019s road assets. This will also ensure greater \neconomic spinoffs for Mongolia as a result of the investments in road construction. \n \n20.  Through the MFF, ADB will prioritize the development of the local road contracting \nindustry in two ways: (i) civil works contracts will be packaged such that local contractors will be \nable to compete under international competitive bidding procedures; and (ii) by making future \ntranches under the MFF contingent on the government providing adequate budgets for road \nmaintenance and upon demonstrated performance of maintenance work, ADB will promote a \nmore steady and expanding stream of work for local contractors. The parallel TA will reinforce \nthese efforts by supporting the development and implementation of asset management systems \nand procedures, and by supporting human resource development, research, and training. \n \nE.

The government has requested an MFF in an amount up to $170 million equivalent from \na blend of ADB's Special Funds resources and ordinary capital resources (OCR) to help finance \n ", "6 \na part of the investment program.17 Mongolia was reclassified as a \u201cGroup B\u201d country eligible for \nOCR financing on 16 August 2011.18 The MFF will consist of three tranches, subject to the \ngovernment's submission of related periodic financing requests, execution of the related loan \nagreements for each tranche, and fulfillment of terms and conditions and undertakings set forth \nin the framework financing agreement (FFA).19 The first tranche, for $45 million equivalent, will \nbe financed by the ADF and will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an \ninterest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  loan  agreement.20 The  government  has \nspecifically requested flexibility in the use of ADF resources for the second and third tranches. It \nis understood that the provision of any such additional ADF financing will be accompanied by a \ncorresponding reduction of the available OCR financing (and vice-versa), so that the total \nfinancing provided by ADB will not exceed the aggregate amount of $170 million equivalent. Any \nadditional ADF allocation will be subject to (i) the general availability of ADF resources from time \nto time, (ii) Mongolia\u2019s access to such resources pursuant to ADB\u2019s then applicable Graduation \nPolicy,21 and the requirements of ADF donors, and (iii) the availability of such resources to \nMongolia pursuant to ADB\u2019s then applicable policy on the performance-based allocation of ADF \nresources.22 The financing plan is in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nSource  Amount ($ million)    Share of Total (%) \nInvestment Program       \nAsian Development Bank  170.00    64.90 \nGovernment   92.00    35.10 \n    Total  262.00    100.00 \nTranche 1       \nAsian Development Bank (Asian Development Fund)  45.00    61.77 \nGovernment  27.85    38.23 \n    Total  72.85    100.00 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF.

The  PIU  will  be  strengthened  through \nadditional  staff  and  support  from  international  project  management  consultants.  The \nimplementation  arrangements  for  the investment  program are  summarized in  Table  3  and \ndescribed in detail in the facility administration manual.23 \n                                                 \n17 The OCR financing will follow the ordinary operations loan regulations applicable to London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based loans, subject to possible modifications under individual loan agreements.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n24.  The western regional road is being constructed as a two-lane, undivided road with a \ndesign speed of up to 100 km per hour. The carriageway is 7 meters wide with 1.5 meter gravel \nshoulders. The existing road to be upgraded under project 1 is entirely made up of dirt tracks. \nThe investment program does not have any unusual technical risks. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n25.  The investment program is economically viable, with an estimated economic internal rate \nof return of 11.0%, and a net present value of $19.5 million at a 10% discount rate. The \ninvestment program will cut user transport costs and time by nearly 50%, ensure all-year access \nfor small vehicles, and reduce travel hazards. The investment program will foster local economic \ngrowth and increase cross-border trade. \n \n26.  It is ADB\u2019s practice to consider projects with an economic internal rate of return above \n10%,  to  be  economically  justified  when  they  generate  significant  unquantified  economic \nbenefits.24 For the investment program, these benefits include (i) increased accessibility to \neducation and health facilities for rural herders; (ii) easier mitigation and relief of weather-related \nemergencies in rural areas; and (iii) scale economies, stronger competition, and agglomeration \n                                                 \n24 ADB. 2003. Economic Analysis of Projects. Operations Manual. OM G1/OP. Manila. \n ", "8 \nbenefits generated by the improved accessibility of western Mongolia. The investment program \nwill also promote poverty relief and improved equity, as (i) it will improve the farm-gate value of \nthe  meat,  wool,  and  dairy  products  sold  by  poor  herders;  (ii)  it  will  create  low-skilled  job \nopportunities  during  construction  and  for  road  maintenance  in  an  area  of  chronic \nunderemployment;  and  (iii) it  will  enhance  gender  equity  by  creating  new  opportunities  for \nwomen herders to generate income, by reducing the time they spend going to market and taking \nchildren to schools or hospitals. The investment program will also help redistribute Mongolia\u2019s \neconomic activity toward its poorest rural areas and foster national integration.  \n \n27.  ADB is implementing several social development projects in western Mongolia, which \nwill complement the investment program and help to spread the benefits of the western regional \nroad to the poor. These include the Education for the Poor\u2014Financial Crisis Response Project; \nEarly  Childhood  Education  for  Rural,  Nomadic,  and  Migrant  Children;  and  the  Food  and \nNutrition, Social Welfare Program and Project.25 \n \n28.  The investment program will not earn any direct revenue. Maintenance of the roads \nconstructed under the investment program will be funded from central government allocations \ncollected from fuel taxes and general revenue allocations. \n \nC.  Governance \n29.  All works and goods to be financed under the MFF will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). All consulting services to \nbe financed under the MFF will be procured in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The procurement plan has been drafted and \nagreed  with  the  government  and  is  included  as  an  appendix  to  the  facility  administration \nmanual.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed with the government. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the facility administration manual. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n30.  A poverty and social analysis was conducted as part of the project preparatory technical \nassistance. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy has been completed.26 A road \nsafety audit has been conducted on the detailed design. A road safety awareness program and \nan HIV and human trafficking awareness and prevention plan will be prepared and implemented \nunder the investment program. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n31.  Environment.  Project  1  has  been  classified  under  environment  category  A.  An \nenvironmental impact assessment in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) \nwas  prepared  and  disclosed.27 Subsequent  projects  are  expected  to  be  classified  under \nenvironment category A. The main potential environmental impacts are on wildlife migration and \n                                                 \n25 ADB. 2009.

To  address  these  impacts,  the  environmental  management  plan  for \nproject 1 includes a wildlife movement study and consultation with local herders to establish \ncrossing locations and implement measures to ensure safe crossings along the project road. \nThe government will be required to implement the plan, and experience demonstrates that \ninstitutional capacity is sufficient. Assuming effective implementation of the mitigation measures \nand  monitoring  requirements  as  outlined  in  the  plan,  the  project  is  not  expected  to  have \nsignificant adverse environmental impacts. \n \n32.  Resettlement. Project 1 has been classified under involuntary resettlement category C \nbecause no impact on any individual, household, assets, or livelihood has been identified. The \nresettlement framework has been prepared as a precautionary measure;28 it has been endorsed \nby the Ministry of Roads, Transportation, Construction and Urban Development (MRTCUD), and \nwas disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 7 October 2011. Subsequent projects are expected to be \nclassified under involuntary resettlement category C. \n \n33.  Indigenous  peoples.  Project  1  has  been  classified  under  indigenous  peoples \ncategory C because the local people are Mongols and are not vulnerable on the basis of \nethnicity. Subsequent projects may be classified under indigenous peoples category B because \nof the presence of Kazakhs and other ethnic groups. For this reason, an indigenous peoples \nplanning framework has been prepared,29 endorsed by the MRTCUD, and disclosed on ADB\u2019s \nwebsite on 13 October 2011. \n \nF.

ASSURANCES \n35.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the investment program shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the facility administration manual and loan documents. The government has given ADB \ncertain undertakings for the MFF, which are set forth in the FFA. Specific covenants agreed by \nthe government with respect to individual tranches under the MFF are set forth in the loan \nagreement for the respective tranches. \n                                                 \n28 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n36.  ADB  will  consider  financing subsequent  tranches if  the  government  adheres  to  the \ngeneral agreement for the MFF as set forth in the FFA. Specific assurances for project 1 should \nalso be complied with by the government. Progress toward achieving the outputs and expected \noutcomes in the design and monitoring frameworks for the investment program and project 1 \nwill also be decision-making criteria for financing subsequent tranches under the MFF. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n37.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the provision of loans under the multitranche financing facility in an aggregate principal \namount not exceeding $170,000,000  to Mongolia for the Western Regional Road Corridor \nInvestment Program comprising \n \n(i)  loans from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with interest and other terms to be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB's then applicable policies relating to Special \nFunds resources, subject to conditions set forth in para. 22 of this report; and \n(ii)  loans from ADB's ordinary capital resources, with interest and other terms to be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; \n \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in \nthe framework financing agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n \n \n17 November 2011 \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK FOR THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact       \nInclusive economic  Traffic at the border with the  Mongolia and Xinjiang  Assumptions \ngrowth is promoted  Russian Federation increases to  statistical yearbooks  Continued macroeconomic \nby enhanced local  17,000 vehicles per year by 2023    stability and growth in \nand regional  (2010 baseline: 8,800 vehicles)  Mongolia border crossing  Mongolia and neighboring \nconnectivity    and customs statistics  countries \nTraffic at the border with the     \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China  Project completion report  Further mining \nincreases to 20,000 vehicles per  and benefit monitoring and  development in western \nyear by 2023 (2010 baseline:  evaluation  Mongolia \n9,600 vehicles)      \n  Local household surveys  Risk \nIncome per capita in western  taken before, during, and  The government does not \nMongolia increases to 80% of  after project completion  have sufficient funds to \nnational average by 2023 (2010  complete the whole \nbaseline: 75% of national  corridor within the \naverage)   programmed time \n   \nFrequency of local herder \nhouseholds\u2019 access to health and \nsocial services increases to 15 \ntimes on average per year by \n2023 (2010 baseline: 10 times on \naverage per year) \n \nOutcome       \nTransport  Reduction in passenger and  Baseline traffic and  Assumptions \naccessibility within  freight vehicle operating costs by  transport cost data  Ongoing technical \nthe project area and  an average of 30% by 2020 (2010    assistance now under \nbetween countries  baseline: $470 passenger/$933  Traffic counts at border  planning is successfully \nimproved  freight)  crossings and strategic  implementeda \n    points in the transport   \nTravel times between Khovd and  network  Neighboring countries \nOlgiy reduced to about 3 hours in    improve border crossing \n2020 (2010 baseline: more than  Field surveys and  procedures \n6 hours)  interviews of road transport   \n  operators and road users  Risk \nTraffic on improved roads  Poor maintenance \nincreases by 40% by 2020 (2010  practices degrade road \nbaseline: 100 vehicles per day)   operating performance \n   \nRoutine and periodic maintenance \nperformed on 743 km of western \nregional road by 2020 \n \nOutputs       \n1.
