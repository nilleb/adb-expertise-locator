INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The regional knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will help strengthen the \ninstitutional and technical capacity for progressing gender equality outcomes in Pacific developing \nmember countries (DMCs), particularly in the context of response and recovery from the coronavirus \ndisease (COVID-19). It will support Pacific DMCs to (i) identify gender mainstreaming opportunities \nand innovative and transformative gender projects and programs; (ii) strengthen DMC capacity to \nimplement  and  monitor  gender  equality  actions;  and  (iii)  strengthen  gender  partnerships  and \nknowledge among Pacific DMCs. The outcomes are directly linked to the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) Strategy 2030 (specifically operational priority 2 of accelerating progress in gender equality) \nand Sustainable Development Goal 5 (achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls).1 \n \n2.  The TA builds on previous ADB support for gender equality in the Pacific, in 2010 and 2016.2 \nThe earlier TA projects focused on strengthening the capacity of selected Pacific countries to use \nand produce gender statistics and develop regional and country-specific gender assessments in Fiji, \nKiribati, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, and Tonga. The resulting data as well as \nprevious capacity building will inform the outputs to be produced through this TA. \n \n3.  The TA is included in the current Pacific Regional Operations Business Plan3 and will support \nthe implementation of the Gender Equality Operational Plan 2019\u20132024.4 It is also included as part \nof ADB\u2019s Comprehensive Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Gender inequality and gender gaps. Empowering women is vital to achieving inclusive, \nresilient, and sustainable development in the Pacific. Despite the progress made by many Pacific \nDMCs in advancing gender equality, a significant proportion of women and girls still face poverty, \ninequality, and exclusion. Customary norms and traditional beliefs on gender roles and the limited \nimplementation of gender policies and legislation have limited women\u2019s and girls\u2019 access to essential \nservices and resources. A significant and persistent gap between men\u2019s and women\u2019s participation \nin economic activity and labor markets is still evident across the region, where women are unable to \naccess finance and credit and continue to work in low-paid jobs or in informal and vulnerable \nemployment. Data show that in 2017, more than half of the people in vulnerable employment were \nwomen.6 Women\u2019s  participation  in  decision-making  (both  formal  and  informal)  has  been  a \nlongstanding  challenge.  While  there  are  good  examples  of  women\u2019s  participation  in  senior \nmanagement positions in both the public and private sphere\u2014e.g., in the Cook Islands and Samoa, \nwhere their share exceeds 45%\u2014Pacific women\u2019s representation in decision-making positions is \ngenerally among the lowest in the world. As of April 2020, only 8.8% of parliamentarians in the Pacific \nwere women (compared with a global average of 23.4%).7  \n \n \n1  ADB. 2018.

The Pacific has some of the highest rates of violence \nagainst women and girls (VAWG) in the world. 8 In various Pacific countries, more than 60% of \nwomen have reported experiencing violence from intimate partners in their lifetime, and more than \n30% of women report being sexually abused before the age of 15.9 The Pacific Partnership to End \nViolence Against Women and Girls (Pacific Partnership), was launched in 2018 and is funded by the \nEuropean Union, the governments of Australia and New Zealand, and the United Nations Entity for \nGender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, known as UN Women; and implemented by the \nSecretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, and UN Women. It \nbrings together governments, civil society organizations, and other partners to promote gender \nequality, prevent VAWG, and increase access to quality response services. However, the prevention \nof VAWG is a new area of work globally, and the focus on VAWG prevention in the Pacific is limited. \nWhile Pacific research studies have contributed to greater knowledge of the prevalence and drivers \nof violence, practice-based lessons from locally led prevention efforts are not widely available or \naccessible. \n \n6.  Impact  of  COVID-19.  Measures  taken  to  prevent  the  transmission  of  COVID-19  are \nexacerbating many of the gender inequalities in Pacific DMCs and disproportionately affect women \nand girls. Women are at increased risk of infection, gender-based violence (GBV), job losses, and \nvulnerable work. This is coupled with limited social protection and less access to formal safety nets, \nless access to finance, increased burden of unpaid care work, loss of livelihoods, and less access \nto sexual and reproductive health services. \n \n7.  Border and travel restrictions are slowing tourism and remittances\u2014both key income streams \nfor women in Pacific DMCs. Non-pharmaceutical interventions such as lockdowns, movement \nrestrictions, closure of shops, and prohibition of roadside vendors have a significant impact on \nwomen\u2019s income. Existing gender pay gaps in paid employment and women\u2019s overrepresentation in \ninformal and vulnerable employment put women at increased risk of poverty and food insecurity as \na result of COVID-19. The latest available data from 2017 show that women accounted for 53.6% of \ntotal employment in services and that most women-owned enterprises in the Pacific are tied to \nservices, notably in wholesale and retail, and the hospitality and tourism industries\u2014areas that are \ndisproportionately  affected  by  COVID-19  (footnote  5).  In  general,  official  social  protection \nmechanisms are scarce across the Pacific (with the exception of social insurance and provident \nfunds that mainly target formal employees in the public sector10), and social protection schemes that \ntarget women are even scarcer.  \n \n8.  In addition to the economic impacts, COVID-19 also exacerbates the already large care duty \nof women (e.g., tending to children who are not at school, homeschooling children who are unable \nto attend regular classes, caring for sick family members with limited access to hospital care). In \naddition, VAWG (particularly sexual exploitation and intimate partner violence) is likely to increase \nbecause of movement restrictions and growing economic and health pressures. In Fiji, for example, \ndomestic violence complaints to GBV support services (e.g., GBV hotlines) more than doubled in \nMarch and April 2020.11  \n \n9.  ADB  Strategy  2030.  ADB  has  the  opportunity  to  support  ambitious  gender  equality \noutcomes  in  Pacific  DMCs  through  ADB  Strategy  2030  (footnote  1),  which  recognizes  the \n \n8  Gender-based violence (GBV) and VAWG are used interchangeably throughout the paper because most gender-based \nviolence is perpetrated by men against women. VAWG is defined as \"any act of gender-based violence that results in, \nor is likely to result in, physical, sexual or mental harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or \narbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life.\" (United Nations General Assembly, 1993). \n9  United Nations Population Fund. kNOwVAWdata: Measuring prevalence of violence against women in Asia-Pacific \n(accessed 22 June 2020). \n10  ADB. 2019.

The ADB corporate results framework \ncommits to: (i) at least 55% of all ADB committed sovereign and nonsovereign operations classified \ngender equity theme (GEN) and effective gender mainstreaming (EGM) by 2030;12 (ii) at least 75% \nof ADB\u2019s committed sovereign and nonsovereign operations to promote gender equality through \ngender-inclusive project designs by 2030;13 and (iii) 80% of all ADB-financed projects and programs \ncategorized GEN or EGM achieve gender equality success rating by 2030. There is also an \nincreased focus on more transformative projects and programs that support the achievement of \nSustainable Development Goal 5 (gender equality).  \n \n10.  Limited gender data. In order to address key gender issues in the Pacific and to meet ADB \ngender equality corporate targets, further gender data and analysis is needed. There are limited \nsystems and capacity in place to collect and monitor sex-disaggregated data. To date, data and \nanalysis on the immediate impact of COVID-19 in Pacific DMCs has included limited information on \nthe gendered impacts of COVID-19.  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  gender  equality  outcomes  in  the  Pacific \nimproved.14 The  TA  will  have  the  following  outcome:  institutional  and  technical  capacity  for \nprogressing gender equality outcomes strengthened.15  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n12.  As well as mitigating the immediate risks of COVID-19 for women and girls, TA support is \nneeded to ensure that gender equality gains are not lost and that women and girls are central to the \nsocioeconomic recovery. The generation and sharing of knowledge and evidence, coupled with \ncapacity development and stronger coordination, will help Pacific DMCs to strengthen their gender-\nresponsive policies and programs. While all Pacific DMCs are eligible for assistance under the TA \nupon request, the initial focus will be on COVID-19-related gender support in the Federated States \nof  Micronesia,  Fiji,  Palau,  Samoa,  Solomon  Islands  and  Vanuatu.16 Additional  requests  for \nassistance will be assessed and prioritized in accordance with the agreed outcomes and outputs \nbelow. If the approach of this TA is successful, additional financing may be considered to expand its \nactivities to other DMCs. \n \n13.  Output 1: Gender-responsive policies and investments identified. The TA will provide \ntechnical expertise, assessments, and other analytical work to support at least three Pacific DMCs \nin  identifying  gender  mainstreaming  opportunities,  and  innovative  and  transformative  gender \nprojects and programs. There will be particular focus on assessing the ongoing gendered impacts \nof COVID-19 and defining policies and investments to counter these. In addition, strategic technical \n \n12  \u2018Gender Equity as a Theme\u2019 (GEN) and \u2018Effective Gender Mainstreaming\u2019 (EGM) are the two highest gender categories \nthat can be assigned to ADB operations. \n13  This includes targeted operations to empower women and girls (projects categorized as GEN), gender mainstreamed \noperations that directly narrow gender gaps or benefit women and girls (project categorized as EGM), operations \nincorporated with some gender designs (projects categorized as some gender elements (SGE)).  \n14  Asian Development Bank. 2018.

Manila. \n15  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n16   Initial countries outlined include Pacific DMCs with ADB COVID-19 projects/programs e.g. ADB COVID-19 Pandemic \nResponse Option. \n ", "4 \n \ninputs will be provided in the following areas: (i) proactive gender design features in policy-based \nlending; (ii) develop innovative gender designs that support the scope of Sustainable Development \nGoal 5; and (iii) enhance gender analysis and formulation of gender action plans in projects that are \nparticularly strategic for demonstrating the importance of gender mainstreaming, or projects that \ncould be categorized GEN. \n \n14.  Output 2: Capacity of Developing Member Countries to implement and monitor gender \nequality actions strengthened. The TA will help strengthen at least five DMCs\u2019 capacity to \nimplement, monitor, and report on gender equality activities and outcomes, including monitoring the \ngender  results  of  Pacific  operations  under  the  COVID-19  Pandemic  Response  Option.  TA \nconsultants will also provide targeted capacity development to executing agencies, implementing \nagencies, and national gender machineries through in-country or online briefings, training, and other \nsupport, as requested. The TA team will support the production of case studies on good practices in \ngender  mainstreaming  and  the  achievement  of  gender  equality  results.  It  will  collect  sex-\ndisaggregated data and help Pacific DMCs to put in place stronger systems to collect such data.  \n \n15.  Output 3: Gender partnerships strengthened and knowledge products produced and \nshared. The TA will create knowledge solutions and strengthen partnerships to improve gender \nequality outcomes in the Pacific. It will work with stakeholders (including SPC) and governments to \ndevelop a research agenda and a knowledge product dissemination plan that meet the needs of \nPacific DMCs. A particular focus will be on GBV prevention and on developing gender knowledge \nproducts to inform the policies and plans for COVID-19 response and recovery. This output will \nsupport coordination and collaboration with the Pacific Partnership to develop and launch a Pacific \nregional GBV prevention hub and online portal.17 This will catalyze the investments made in GBV \nprevention to date, and build on existing partnerships in the Pacific to ensure sustainability. It will \ncreate a Pacific evidence base that highlights what works to prevent GBV, and fosters coordination \nand knowledge management among Pacific DMCs to ensure effective and evidence-based GBV \nprevention. To share knowledge and lessons, and to support learning and capacity development, \nthe TA will also ensure that representatives of at least two Pacific DMCs participate in person or \nvirtually in regional and/or global conferences, such as the United Nations Commission on the Status \nof Women and the triennial conference of Pacific Women and Pacific Women\u2019s Ministers meeting.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.225 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6: $650,000; TASF-other sources: $575,000). The cost \nestimate and financing plan is in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented from August 2020 to July 2025. ADB, through its Pacific \nDepartment, will administer the TA, including selecting, supervising and evaluating consultants and \nprocuring goods and non-consulting services. The Pacific Department will work closely with the \nSustainable Development and Climate Change Department\u2019s Gender Equity Thematic Group to \nensure  complementarity  with  other  gender  initiatives  in  ADB.  The  ministries  or  departments \nresponsible for women\u2019s affairs in participating DMCs will be the implementing agencies. The DMCs \nwill designate a TA focal point and assistant to review reports and coordinate activities and in-kind \ncontributions. The Pacific Department will maintain close coordination with field offices, other \ndevelopment partners, and regional organizations in the Pacific. Disbursement of TA proceeds will \n \n17 The online portal will be developed in accordance with para. 20 of the staff instructions. This TA will assist in developing \nand launching the knowledge portal, which will be hosted by a regional body or partnership such as the SPC or the \nPacific Partnership.

ADB will engage the consultants following the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time) and its associated staff instructions. The TA will require a minimum of 30 person-\nmonths of international and 96 person-months of national consulting services. International and \nnational individual consultants will be engaged to support the implementation of activities. Consulting \nfirms or civil society organizations may also be engaged for activities. The precise nature of experts \nand inputs will be defined based on the needs identified in consultation with beneficiary DMCs. The \nPacific  Department  will  consult  ADB\u2019s  Procurement,  Portfolio  and  Financial  Management \nDepartment when finalizing the nature and extent of consulting inputs and of consultants\u2019 terms of \nreference. The TA scope is also expected to expand to cover additional activities and will be \nreplenished from time to time as funds are required and identified, including those from cofinancing \nsources and ADB-administered trust funds. Accordingly, the nature and extent of consulting inputs \nmay increase and consultant contracts may be extended with corresponding budget increases \nsubject to their satisfactory performance and continued availability.
