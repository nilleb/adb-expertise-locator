Kazpost Joint Stock Company (Kazpost) has asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nto provide technical assistance (TA) to help prepare a quality corporate business plan and a \nreputable credit rating. Both of these activities are necessary to support a fund-raising program \n(long-term, nonrecourse, or nonsovereign finance) for the development of postal and financial \nservices centers primarily in rural areas of Kazakhstan. The Fact-Finding Mission, from 26 \nAugust to 5 September 2006, resulted in an understanding between ADB and Kazpost and its \nsole shareholder, Samruk State Holding Company (Samruk), on the TA objectives, scope, \nfinancing plan, and implementation arrangements.1 A design and monitoring framework for the \nTA is in Appendix 1.  \n \n2.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing ADB, the Government of Kazakhstan (the \nGovernment) will be asked to confirm that it has no objection to the TA. No activities under the \nTA will commence and no TA consultant will be contractually engaged by ADB unless and until \nADB receives a no-objection letter from the Government. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The  geographic,  demographic,  and  economic  features  of  Kazakhstan  include  vast \nterritory,  low  and  uneven  density  of  population,  remoteness  of  inhabited  localities,  and \nsignificantly lower ability to pay for services in rural areas. As an estimated 43% of the country\u2019s \npopulation lives in rural areas,2 the provision of basic postal and financial services represents an \nimportant public policy objective. Acceleration of demand for such services and ability to pay in \nrecent years is due in part to the high Kazakhstan literacy rate (99.4%) and decreasing poverty \nrate in the country as whole, including many rural areas.3 The initial poverty and social analysis \nis in Appendix 2. \n \n4.  Worldwide,  providers  of  postal  universal  service  obligations  have  been  increasingly \nchallenged to operate efficiently and profitably (i) given the burden of low margin or even loss-\nmaking segments of rural area business, (ii) the need to function within very competitive urban \nenvironments, and (iii) reduction of physical mail services due to the growth of rapid information \ntechnology transfer. Frequently this has led to requests for operating and/or capital subsidies, \nincluding in cases of economically unsustainable rural services required under the universal \nservice obligations and/or for reduction or outright discontinuation of cross-subsidies from urban \ncustomers to rural customers.4 Over the last decade, the impetus to corporatize national postal \noperators has been growing in many parts of the developing and developed world. In optimal \ncases, operators have been able to improve logistical and financial performance significantly not \nonly through efficiency measures but also through changes in business definition. Usually this \nhas involved expansion into more commercially profitable specialized postal services and use of \ntraditional postal service infrastructure to deliver financial and other services. Given the high \nfixed-cost nature of the industry and ineffectiveness of legislated monopoly status, these types \nof proactive business strategies have become more and more essential for commercial viability. \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 11 September 2006. \n2  The Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan. 2004.

World Bank Policy Research Working Paper. Washington, DC: World Bank (June). \n ", "2 \n \n5.  Kazpost was established in November 1995 as a state enterprise and in December 1999 \nwas transformed into a joint stock company under full state ownership.5 Its corporatization, \nwhich formed part of a broad government reform program covering many major infrastructure \nservices,  provided  effective  tools  to  company  management  to  generate  cash-flow  positive \noperations albeit at still low profit margins and with little independent capability to raise long-\nterm debt finance. In 2001, Kazpost was granted a license to provide a limited range of financial \nservices (outside of lending).6 The license allows it to undertake primarily (i) agency functions \nincluding payments of pensions, wages, and social allowances; and collection of public utility \npayments and taxes; (ii) agency functions for securities market transactions and (iii) loan agent \nfunctions for banks without access to its regions. In addition, it was permitted to take deposits \nfrom  postal  customers.7  Over  the  last  few  years,  its  standard  postal  facilities  have  been \ntransformed into postal and financial service centers, often the only facility of its type in many \nrural parts of Kazakhstan. By the end of 2007, all rural postal facilities owned by Kazpost are \nexpected to be connected via the Internet (for both staff and customers). \n \n6.  The Government established Samruk to strengthen corporate governance practices by \nappointing corporate directors tasked only with safeguarding commercial viability and avoiding \nconfusion between the role of Government as shareholder and the Government\u2019s policymaking \nand  regulatory  functions.  Under  such  corporate  governance  principles,  Samruk-appointed \ndirectors would be expected to take an active role in guiding strategic policies of the company \nbut not be involved in day-to-day management. In January 2006, Samruk identified Kazpost as \none  of  five  selected  companies  with  full  or  partial  government  ownership.8  In  June  2006, \nSamruk nominated its first new directors to the Kazpost board of directors, replacing directors \nrepresenting government line ministries. With the revamped board, Kazpost must now focus on \ndeveloping a comprehensive business plan that documents existing plans, and augment it with \npotential  improvements  and  new  actions.  Such  a  business  plan  would  require  Samruk \ninvolvement  in  components  categorized  as  strategic  planning.  Development  of  a  plan  and \ndiscussion of this plan will be a good means of delineating pragmatic guidelines for decision-\nmaking allocation between the new Kazpost board and management. \n \n7.  Kazpost\u2019s business plan should be used effectively to better communicate its medium- to \nlong-term vision to its longer term debt financiers, and prior to that with rating-agency analysts. \nCurrently, Kazpost debt is primarily short to medium term, extended via locally based financial \ninstitutions and the local bond market. It has only successfully raised long-term finance once \nthrough a government-guaranteed loan from the Islamic Development Bank. Like other large-\nscale fully or partially state-owned enterprises in Kazakhstan, Kazpost carries a credit rating \nfrom one of the three international rating agencies (Standard & Poor\u2019s); this rating is just one-\nhalf grade below the Kazakhstan sovereign rating. Based on a review of the most recent \ninternational ratings update report, this grade is heavily contingent on the perception that the \nGovernment can be relied upon to make equity injections into the company to cover a significant \nportion  of  its  capital  spending.  Since  Kazpost  is  undertaking  a  major  long-term  borrowing \nprogram on its own and wishes to reduce its dependence on government equity contributions \n                                                 \n5 Originally named OJSC Kazpost at time of original corporatization, but renamed Kazpost Joint Stock Company at \ntime of reregistration in 2004. \n6  Kazpost is not currently permitted to extend credit, but Financial Supervision Agency of Kazakhstan has granted an \napproval (subject to amendment of postal legislation) for Kazpost to undertake limited scale microfinance lending \nand credit card operations secured by payments of government salaries or pension and limited to 3 years. \n7  Kazpost\u2019s depository base is currently estimated at $3 million\u2013$4 million in total by its Treasury Department.   \n8  Republic of Kazakhstan Presidential Decree, On the Measures to Further Ensure the Government Interests in the \nState Economy Governance, 28 January 2006.  ", "3 \nfor a major portion of its capital financing program, the next rating-agency presentation will \nrequire detailed planning and preparation, particularly given that the company\u2019s corporate debt \nprofile will be significantly changed.   \n \n8.  Kazpost\u2019s next long-term borrowing (requested from ADB on commercial nonsovereign \nterms) will finance new construction of 800 rural postal facilities (700 to replace existing leased \nfacilities and 100 facilities at new locations).9 The plan is geared to create modernized postal \nfacilities under Kazpost\u2019s newer expanded business model and to address large rural population \nmigration over the decade, and further migrations due in part to the Government\u2019s Strategy for \nTerritorial Development, which restricts major government infrastructure investment to areas \nviewed to be economically viable.10\n \n9.  The  proposed  rural  post  office  project  will  be  the  largest  construction  program  in \nKazpost\u2019s history as a company. Currently, this function is undertaken by Kazpost\u2019s real estate \ndivision. The institutional capacity to undertake such a large program over a short period of 3 \nyears will require assessment of its capability to complete the project on time and on budget. In \nthis context, the tie between construction completion, and universal service obligations and \nrevenue generation by new facilities should be well understood by Kazpost\u2019s board of directors \nand management. \n \n10.  The TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s Kazakhstan country strategy and program update \n(2006\u20132008),11 which (i) indicates that ADB will identify means of supporting subsovereign \ninfrastructure companies with demonstrated ability to act in a commercially viable manner and \n(ii) support rural development initiatives a key Government priority. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  This project preparatory TA will help prepare Kazpost with major long-term borrowing on \na commercial nonsovereign basis, and contribute to improving its ability to access long-term \nborrowing on the international and domestic financial markets. The TA will help define an \ninvestment and fund-raising program; and focus on institutional strengthening. This will back up \na sustainable borrowing program by the company. In addition, it will ensure that Kazpost has the \ncapacity to manage and undertake the proposed large-scale construction project. The TA is not \nintended to cover areas normally associated with standard due diligence by ADB or by other \nlenders. Such due diligence will be carried out on a normal commercial basis prior to any future \nADB  loan  processing.  The  TA  objectives  are  to  (i)  enhance  Kazpost\u2019s  business  planning \nprocess and final business plan (ii) assist Kazpost in developing a management, planning, and \nfinancial information documentation system necessary for initial and ongoing interface with \ncredit-rating  agencies;  and  (iii)  strengthen  Kazpost\u2019s  construction  management  capacity  to \nensure that large capital projects are implemented efficiently. The TA will support the financial \nmanagement and overall capacity of Kazpost. The TA will contribute to the extension of a \nprivate  market  credit  culture  in  Kazakhstan  that  recognizes  and  rewards  fully  or  partially \n                                                 \n9  ADB is being requested to provide a loan on a corporate basis for (i) 562 of the 800 new postal facilities, and (ii) \ncertain logistics improvements. Government equity contributions are expected to finance the remaining 238 new \npostal new facilities. \n10  Republic of Kazakhstan. 2006 Strategy of Territorial Development of the Republic of Kazakhstan up to 2015. \n{Astana City} (28 August).  \n11  ADB. 2005.

Manila. \n ", "4 \ngovernment-owned  companies  able  to  consistently  transmit  professionally  assembled \ntransparent information to credit-rating agencies and markets. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.   The TA will have three components. Component A will cover the development of a \ncomprehensive business plan for Kazpost. This plan will incorporate basic principles associated \nwith high-quality corporate planning, drawing on best practices from comparable postal and low-\nrisk  financial  service  and  agency  businesses.  Component  B  will  focus  on  establishing  a \nsustainable  credit-rating  agency  with  interface  via  direct  assistance  to  Kazpost  in  the \npreparation of the initial package of presentation materials for rating-agency consideration. \nSuggestions  for  improving  presentations  for  annual  rating-agency  review  will  also  be \nincorporated into this component. Component C will focus on a review of Kazpost\u2019s capacity to \nundertake all construction work under the investment program on time and on budget. This will \nfeed into the perspective of normal lender due diligence risk mitigation. \n \n13.  Components A, B, and C are expected to be undertaken in parallel, although some \nsubcomponents under each will be carried out sequentially. To assess the results of the TA \nactivities, a series of performance indicators and milestones will be established as a baseline at \nthe start of the TA, and be monitored throughout its duration. \n \n14.  ADB  will  train  up  to  three  Kazpost  officials  on  ADB\u2019s  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards through participation in seminars run by ADB staff as well as on-the\u2013job 1 week \nimmersion training with Regional and Sustainable Development Department staff involved in the \npreparation of ADB-funded projects. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,000,000 equivalent. Kazpost has asked ADB \nto provide $600,000. Kazpost will finance the balance. The ADB part of the TA will be financed \non a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan \nare given in Appendix 3. Kazpost has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit \nADB  to  finance  any  ensuing  project.  In  the  event  that  the  TA  results  in  further  financial \nassistance from ADB (whether by loan, equity, guarantee, or otherwise), Kazpost will repay the \ngrant through composite pricing (including fees) of the financial package or through refinancing \nthe grant from the package. Kazpost will also repay the grant under this TA to ADB, in the event \nthat the project contemplated under this TA is financed from any other source. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  Samruk is the Executing Agency for the TA and Kazpost is the Implementing Agency. \nKazpost will establish project offices in Almaty and Astana for the consultants and administrative \nsupport  funded  under  the  TA.  Kazpost  will  designate  an  individual  to  coordinate  with  the \nconsultants. A coordinating committee consisting of Samruk and Kazpost representatives will \nprovide general guidance and oversee TA implementation.  \n \n17.  The TA will require approximately 8 person-months of international consulting services \nand 15 person-months of national consulting services. The international consultants will be (i) a \npostal services industry specialist (2 person-months), (ii) financial services industry specialist \n(1.5  person-months),  (iii)  credit-rating  expert  (2.5  person-months),  and  (iv)  construction \nmanagement specialist (2 person-months). One of the international consultants will be the team \nleader, responsible for all aspects of TA implementation. The national consultants will be (i) ", "5 \ndetailed design engineer (5 person-months), (ii) information technology specialist (5 person-\nmonths), and (iii) construction budgeting consultant (5 person-months). In view of the narrow \nfocus of the scope of work, the multidisciplinary nature and complexity of the required tasks, and \nalternative methods and mix of expert skills for carrying out the TA, all international consultants \nwill be engaged on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  (2006).  Kazpost  will  finance  and  engage  all  national  consultants.  National \nconsultants will be engaged by Kazpost on terms satisfactory to ADB. The outline terms of \nreference for consulting services are in Appendix 4. \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 4 months, starting in December 2006 and ending in \nMarch 2007. Reports will include an inception report including the work plan and key milestones \n(at the end of month 1) and monthly progress reports, culminating in a final report at the end of \nthe TA. The key deliverables (to be developed outside of reports) are the draft business plan \nand rating-agency submission package. A number of special activity reports will be prepared, \nbased on inputs from consultants. They will be referenced and included in the progress and final \nreports. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nKazpost  Joint  Stock  Company  for  preparing  the  Kazpost  Financial  Strengthening  and \nModernization Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1   \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets/  Data Sources/ Reporting \nDesign Summary  Assumptions and Risks \nIndicators  Mechanisms \nImpact      Assumption \n       \nState-owned enterprise,  Postal and financial  \u2022 Transaction and TA  Government and Samruk \nKazpost, under Samruk  services network  reports  provide a system of \ndevelops a rural postal  covering rural areas in  disincentives to draw on state \nservices and financial  the country  equity contributions to \nnetwork funded by long-   finance the majority of capital \nterm debt without reliance  Debt maturities are  costs \non government support or  lengthened for finance of \nguarantees.   long-life physical assets. \n  Debt/equity ratios \ncomparable to upper tier \ncomparator companies \nfrom other countries  \nOutcome      Assumption \n       \nKazpost is able to raise  International credit-rating  \u2022 Formal rating  Rating agency reacts \nlong-term finance from  agency(ies) assign  notification from  positively to Kazpost\u2019s plans \ncommercial (including  rating(s) within one  international agency  for moderate-risk business \ninternational) sources  grade of sovereign rating  including satisfactory  growth \nunder international best  with reliance on Kazpost  report language on   \npractice without sovereign  as a stand-alone  business planning,  Risk \nguarantee to fund large- business entity with  management, and cash- Officials in charge of interface \nscale rural development  reasonable mid- to long- flow projections    during future rating-agency \nproject.
