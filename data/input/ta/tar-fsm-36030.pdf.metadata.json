A report on the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) in the Pacific Islands Economic \nReport (PIER) series was published in March 1997.1 Since then the country\u2019s economic outlook \nhas significantly changed, particularly following the conclusion of the first 15-year phase\u2014fiscal \nyear (FY) 1986\u2013FY2001\u2014of the financial provisions of the Compact of Free Association (the \nCompact) between the United States (US) and the FSM, and the recent agreement reached on \nNovember 2003 on the next 20 years (FY2004\u2013FY2023). While ensuring substantial transfers of \nfunds and other forms of assistance from the US to the FSM,2 the new agreement also suggests \nthat similar financial provisions will not be extended to a third period after their expiration in \n2023, imposing economic self-reliance on the FSM. Several Asian Development Bank (ADB) \ntechnical assistance (TA) projects have been improving the FSM\u2019s economic management and \npolicy formulation capacity.3 The 2003 FSM Country Strategy and Program Update includes a \nproposed TA to conduct in-depth economic analysis and provide policy advice to Government. \nA key TA output will be preparation of an economic report in the PIER series. Given the recent \nstart of a new phase of the Compact, the timing for a new PIER couldn\u2019t be more appropriate. \nThe FSM national Government and ADB reached an understanding on the TA goals, purpose, \nimplementation agreements, costs, and financing arrangements during the Fact-Finding Mission \nfielded in March 2003.4 The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  In recent years the FSM has undergone significant political and economic change. After \nthe national elections in March 2003, a new President took office in July 2003, and a new \nCabinet was appointed shortly thereafter. In November, 2003 the US Congress approved an \namended version of the Compact set forth in 1986 with the FSM. The amended Compact \n(Compact, Phase II) provides the terms for financial assistance from the US to the FSM for 20 \nyears starting in FY2004, in the form of grants and contributions to a trust fund.5 In the first year \nthe total disbursement from the US is expected to reach $92 million, of which $76 million will be \nin grants, and $16 million in trust fund contributions. From the fourth year onward, the Compact, \nPhase II incorporates an annual shift of $800,000 from grants to the trust fund component.  \n \n3.  The Compact, Phase II proposal includes new and enhanced accountability procedures. \nIn particular, following the proposed new fiscal procedures, within 3 months after the agreement \nbecomes  effective,  the  FSM  is  required  to  prepare  a  strategic  development  plan  (SDP) \nidentifying the goals and a broad strategy to promote sustainable growth and achieve economic \nself-reliance. The proposal requires the SDP to serve as the main document against which a \n                                                 \n1   ABD. 1997. Federated States of Micronesia. 1996 Economic Report.

Manila  (TA  3783-FSM;  rating, \nsatisfactory). \n4  The proposed TA was first listed in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 6 March 2003. \n5  Grants are meant to assist in education, health care, private sector development, environment, capacity building, \nand public infrastructure. The trust fund is supposed to remain untouched during Compact, Phase II, after which \nthe fund is expected to yield an annual income sufficient to replace the US contribution to the FSM budget. ", "2     \n \nUS-FSM Joint Economic Management Committee will be asked to approve Compact, Phase II \nannual budget allocations.6 \n \n4.  To  prepare  for  the  SDP,  and  following  the  practice  of  the  last  two  appointed \nadministrations, the Government is planning to organize the third FSM economic summit (SUM) \nin early 2004.7 It aims to increase awareness of, and prepare the country for, Compact, Phase \nII, and create an important forum for discussion among key figures in the state and national \ngovernment agencies, as well as relevant stakeholders. The SUM is supposed to discuss social \nand economic policies and provide direction for the medium-term economic strategy. ADB is \nhelping the FSM organize the SUM and prepare the SDP under a small-scale TA.8 \n \n5.  Compact, Phase II will impose a substantial change in the FSM\u2019s approach to economic \nmanagement  and  policy  formulation.  While  the  country  remains  highly  vulnerable  and \ndependent on external assistance, the shift from external sources of income to trust fund-\ngenerated revenues represents a fundamental move to increased economic independence, self-\nreliance, and self-determination. Economic and financial management needs to formulate a \nstrategy to achieve economic self-reliance and to reassess the role of existing social and \neconomic institutions, and consider the possibility of creating new agencies that can respond to \nfuture challenges.  \n \n6.  Economic  behavior  in  the  FSM  is  shaped  by  a  number  of  social  and  economic \ninstitutions whose structure, functions, and significance have been changing over the years. The \nfamily and church, for example, largely determine the form of social interaction and expectations \namong economic actors. The geographic condition of small islands and their limited land and \npopulation, and a tribal society based on an extended family structure have induced forms of \nland tenure and succession that may have restricted private sector investment. Traditionally \nimportant  economic  factors  such  as  human  resource  development,  entrepreneurship, \nconsumption and investment patterns, and the supply of social services are largely affected by \nCompact provisions, local institutions, and the government development strategy. Financial \nsector  development,  increasing  poverty,  and  environmental  concerns  are  also  posing  new \nchallenges to social and economic development. \n \n7.  In summary, a comprehensive report on the FSM should be prepared now. The country \nis at the crossroads and needs to be guided forward. Compact, Phase II will place new and \nsignificant demands on limited government capacities. The SDP will identify strategic directions, \nbut follow-up work will be needed to define the supportive policy frameworks and reforms in key \nsectors. The SUM will also provide valuable feedback from stakeholders regarding medium-\nterm priorities. As a follow-up of the 1997 PIER, the proposed report can help relate these \nrequirements and provide coherent advice on policy actions and reforms at macroeconomic and \nsectoral levels. \n \n                                                 \n6  The Department of Economic Affairs of the FSM national Government is responsible for coordinating SDP \npreparation. \n7  The first SUM was organized in 1996, and the second in 1999, both coinciding with the start of a new political \nadministration and election of a new President. ADB has provided support and assistance to both summits. \n8  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the Federated States of Micronesia for a National Strategic Development Plan. \nManila (TA-4171-FSM). ", "3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.   Purpose and Output  \n8.  The goal of this TA is to help the Government and others understand the economic \nimplications of the Compact, Phase II, and to prepare for the likely termination of Compact \nassistance in 2024. To improve understanding of the FSM economy and its management, and \nto recommend policies to achieve economic self-reliance, an economic report on the FSM will \nbe prepared under this TA, as part of the ADB PIER series. The report will analyze past trends, \nthe current situation, and future perspectives of the country\u2019s economic development process. \nFollowing an approach similar to the one adopted in the 1996 PIER, which focused on human \nresource  development,  the  new  report  could  include  a  general  overview  of  the  economy, \ndeepening the analysis of the effect of the Compact on the country\u2019s economic structure and \nbehavior of economic actors. The PIER could also discuss the role of local institutions in \neconomic development, as well as selected emerging economic issues. These key issues will \nbe identified through dialogue with Government and other stakeholders, especially during the \nSUM, also in consideration of existing economic material and analysis prepared by the FSM \nadministration and external funding agencies. While the report will discuss the progress made \nwith human resource development since the 1997 PIER, the focus of this report will be on \ninstitutions, Compact-related analysis, and emerging economic issues, which were chosen for \ntheir relevance to economic performance. A major contribution of the report is expected to be \nprovision  of  policy  recommendations  and  advice  to  strengthen  economic  self-reliance  and \nenable the creation of an environment to foster investment and private sector development. The \nPIER will not only provide a thorough analysis of development trends for the economy, but also \nproduce an outlook of the next two decades linked to Compact, Phase II, with a medium-term \nfocus  (FY2005\u2013FY2009).  Considering  the  timing  of  publication  and  the  prominence  of  the \nCompact-related analysis, the proposed title of the PIER is \u201cBeyond Compact. FSM Economic \nReport 2005.\u201d \n \n9.  The detailed content of the report is suggested to be as follows9: \n \n(i)  Introduction and executive summary. This section will highlight the study\u2019s \nmain findings. \n \n(ii)  Section I (history and institutions). It will provide a historical background and \ncomprehensive analysis of traditional and modern institutions, focused on the \nway they affect the economic decision-making process of local stakeholders, and \na governance analysis of major economic institutions. \n \n(iii)  Section II (economic development beyond the Compact). It will be a detailed \nstudy of the impact on the economy of the Compact\u2019s first phase and implications \nof the new 20-year phase, including the identification of development trends and \npossible ways to achieve economic self-reliance. This section will review the \ndevelopment process since independence, critically analyze economic policy and \nthe  reform  agenda,  discuss  likely  challenges  after  Compact,  Phase  II,  and \npropose a medium-term economic strategy to increase self-reliance. \n \n(iv)  Section  III  (emerging  economic  issues).  Increasing  poverty,  environmental \nconcerns, and regulation of foreign direct investment are among the emerging \n                                                 \n9  The proposed outline of the PIER is presented in Appendix 2. ", "4     \n \neconomic issues for the FSM. Other main topics for possible inclusion in this \nsection are human resource development, functioning of the financial sector, and \nprivate sector development in one major sector. The choice of the issues to be \nincluded will be made in consultation with Government after the conclusion of the \nSUM. \n \n(v)  Conclusions and recommendations. This section will provide policy advice for \nthe country\u2019s medium-term economic development. \n \n10.  As the TA purpose is to help the country improve economic management and policy \nformulation by preparing an economic report, an intrinsic aim of the project is to foster capacity \nbuilding of individuals and institutions and to fully reflect local priorities and concerns in the \npolicy advice provided by the PIER. Accordingly, a summary of the main topics and preliminary \nrecommendations  will  be  presented  and  discussed  in  various  seminars  organized  in \ncollaboration with the national and state governments and possibly with other institutions such \nas the FSM Development Bank and similar agencies.  \n \nB.   Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The PIER will be prepared on the basis of rigorous analysis and a sound methodological \napproach, while reflecting local conditions, priorities, and concerns. The PIER team will consist \nof international and local consultants under an international team leader team leader with overall \nresponsibility to complete the report according to required quality standards and timing. The \nwork of the local consultants will be organized through a local coordinator, who will liaise with \nthe team leader. The PIER is expected to serve as a user-friendly reference for economic \nanalysis and policy formulation. The capacity-building process is expected to mainly benefit staff \nof the national Government\u2019s Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) and local individuals, who \nwill assist the team of consultants and PIER preparation.  \n \n12.  The report will be prepared taking into full consideration the previous and current work of \nADB and other local and international agencies on related issues.10 Discussion and interviews \nwith local individuals will also provide first-hand information and material for the report. Of \nparticular reference will be the SUM deliberations as well as the content of the SDP, which is \nexpected to be ready by end-December 2003, as part of the requirements for commencing \nCompact, Phase II. Local and international consultants will refer to the SDP and the outcome of \nthe SUM in formulating their analysis and providing recommendations. The PIER content will be \ndiscussed with the Government and other local stakeholders at appropriate intervals during \nreport preparation. The draft report will be presented to Government before finalization. The \nreport and its highlights will be printed using ADB facilities. \n \n13.  The  seminars  are  expected  to  be  convened  in  each  of  the  four  federal  states. \nParticipants  will  include  policymakers,  civil-society  representatives,  and  students.  As \nbackground  material  for  these  seminars,  brochures  summarizing  the  PIER  content  and \npreliminary  recommendations  will  be  prepared  and  distributed.  The  seminars  will  be  held, \nideally, on or about September 2004, after the first draft of the PIER is completed. The outcome \nof the seminars is to be used to revise and finalize the report. \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2001.

In particular, ADB is \nimplementing a private sector development loan and TA projects to help prepare the SDP and define a road map to \nrestructure the public sector. Links and coordination will be established between these activities and the PIER. ", "5 \n \n14.  The involvement of a wide spectrum of local stakeholders in preparing the PIER will \nstimulate local interest in the report and facilitate its diffusion, once the report and its highlights \nare available in the final book version. The team leader and the local coordinator are expected \nto provide, in close consultation with Government, a detailed plan to disseminate the PIER \namong the local and international communities. The highlights of the report (around 20 pages), \npublished with graphics and pictures, will be prepared and printed for public distribution. \n \nC.   Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The total cost of the proposed TA is estimated at $320,000. ADB will finance $250,000. \nThe  Government  will  provide  the  balance  of  $70,000  through  in-kind  contributions,  local \ncounterpart staff, and other TA-related activities. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the \nADB\u2019s TA funding program. The detailed cost estimate and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.   Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  DEA will be the TA Executing Agency, with responsibility for monitoring and supervising \nthe  TA  activities,  providing  qualified  counterpart  staff  and  administrative  support  to  the \nconsultants, organizing the seminars in the four states to disseminate the report, and ensuring \nfollow-up of suggestions after TA completion.  \n \n17.  Assuming that the SUM will take place in early 2004, the TA will start in April 2004 for \naround 9 months. A first complete draft of the report is expected to be ready by end-August \n2004 and presented at seminars in the four states, a draft final report submitted for review by \nmid-October, and the final manuscript by mid-November. The report and its highlights are \nexpected to be published in their final form and disseminated by end-2004. The TA will provide \na total of 12\u201315 person-months of local and international consulting services. The team of \nconsultants will include two international and three or more local experts in socioeconomic \nissues. One international consultant will serve as the team leader for the PIER, and one local \nconsultant as local coordinator. The consultants will be recruited from an international firm, in \naccordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, using the quality and cost-\nbased selection based on biodata technical proposal. The team leader will be responsible for \nsubmitting  the  inception,  midterm,  and  final  reports.  Coordinated  by  the  team  leader, \nconsultants  will  also  suggest  means  to  diffuse  the  PIER  and  disseminate  its  policy \nrecommendations among interested agencies, groups, and the public. The outline terms of \nreference for the consultants are in Appendix 4.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $250,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  the  Federated  States  of  Micronesia  for  the  Preparation  of  a  Country \nEconomic Report, and hereby reports this action to the Board.
