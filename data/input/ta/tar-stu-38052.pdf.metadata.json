The concept of regional economic cooperation in Asia was revived by global political \nchanges of the late 1980s, rapid economic growth and transformation of many Asian countries, \nand globalization of the world economy. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has played a \ncritical role in promoting subregional economic cooperation throughout the Asian and Pacific \nregion, most notably through the Greater Mekong Subregional Program (the GMS Program). A \ndistinguishing feature of these cooperation schemes is their emphasis on promoting economic \nties with neighboring countries by removing structural impediments to cooperation, such as poor \nphysical infrastructure connections. The development of transport infrastructure networks and of \nregional agreements covering movement of goods and services through them has been of great \nimportance to the GMS Program. Much progress has been made in improving transport access, \nefficiency, and comfort. However, the transport sector in almost all of the Greater Mekong \nSubregion (GMS) countries requires sustained development and investment. Transport linkages \nbetween member countries are limited, and a multimodal, integrated GMS transport network, \nwhich would expand and intensify regional economic cooperation, still does not exist. \n \n2.  The ability of the GMS to realize its potential as a tightly interconnected economic entity \nof 260 million people depends critically on the speed with which connectivity is established \nbetween member economies and with major economic partners. The objective of the technical \nassistance (TA) is to develop a clear vision and comprehensive strategy to develop a GMS \ntransport network that will promote connectivity and competitiveness, and strengthen the spirit \nof community. This TA is included in the GMS Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program   \n2004\u20132008. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.1  \n \nII.   ISSUES \n \n3.  The  GMS  Program,  which  was  initiated  in  1992,  aims  to  strengthen  the  economic \nlinkages among Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, Viet Nam, \nand Yunnan Province of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The basic objectives of the \nGMS Program are to facilitate sustainable economic growth, create jobs, and reduce poverty by \nusing the comparative advantages of the participating countries for mutual benefit. Since its \ninception, the GMS Program has greatly increased cooperation and promoted understanding \namong the participating countries. ADB has played a key role in GMS development, serving as \nfinancier, provider of technical advice, catalyst for financing, \u201chonest broker,\u201d and secretariat to \nthe program.2  \n \n4.  The  GMS  Program  has  evolved  to  meet  emerging  needs  and  demands,  and  has \nconsistently  recognized  that  the  transport  sector,  by  improving  connectivity  and  regional \ncooperation, is important to increase economic growth. Large markets spanning two or more \ncountries, and economies of scale can come about only if various regional and national centers \nof  production  and  consumption  are  linked  by  modern  and  efficient  infrastructure.  Lack  of \ninterconnectivity between national networks, lack of interoperability between different modes of \ntransportation,  and  missing  links  and  bottlenecks  constrain  development  of  cross-border \nnetworks.  \n  \n5.  ADB has helped develop the GMS transport system in a variety of ways: (i) financing \nand implementing analytical studies, (ii) financing regional projects as well as national projects \nwith  regional  implications,  (iii)  promoting  policy  initiatives  and  institution  building,  and  (iv) \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 14 May 2004. \n2  ADB has provided about $1.2 billion to finance 17 projects since the inception of the program. Over $920 million of \ncofinancing has been mobilized. ADB has provided approximately $50 million for TA. ", "2  \nmobilizing financial resources from GMS and non-GMS countries. A noteworthy contribution has \nbeen  the  development  of  the  corridor  concept:  transport  infrastructure  is  developed  in  a \nspecified geographic area in close conjunction with economic activities. Five corridors linking \nthe entire subregion have been agreed upon and are at various stages of development and are \nexpected to be completed by the end of this decade. Appendix 2 lists ADB-financed transport \nprojects under the GMS Program. \n \n6.  A master plan for the GMS transport sector was developed in 1995, and most initiatives \nproposed in the study have been implemented either as GMS projects or as part of national \nprojects. The state of transport sector infrastructure in the GMS is, therefore, much better than it \nwas a scant decade ago. Still, many national and regional problems continue to impede the \nvision of a fully connected GMS. At the national level, all major transport modes face problems \nof varying intensity: physical gaps, low efficiency, and poor reliability and safety. Where new \ntransport  systems  have  been  developed,  sometimes  low-income  groups  have  problems \naccessing them. The experiences of the past decade underscore the need for transport sector \ndevelopment to help solve social problems and overcome negative externalities. A regional road \nnetwork will be in place at the end of the decade. Networks in other transport modes are less \ndeveloped  and  constrained  by  technical,  organizational,  and  institutional  barriers,  but  are \ngradually emerging as a result of greater confidence among the countries, liberalization of \nmarkets, or technological advances. Interchanges and interoperability between different modes \nare, however, generally missing in the GMS and need to be developed systematically.  \n \n7.  A major watershed in the development of the GMS Program was the summit of leaders \nheld in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, in November 2002. The leaders expressed their vision of an \nintegrated, prosperous, and equitable GMS. The 12th Ministerial Meeting of the GMS, held in \nDali, Yunnan, PRC, in September 2003, gave further impetus to the leaders\u2019 vision by calling for \nenhanced connectivity, increased competitiveness, and greater sense of community. The vision, \naspirations, and needs of GMS countries are reflected in the recent GMS Regional Cooperation \nStrategy and Program 2004\u20132008, which calls for an integrated transport sector master plan \nbeyond 2006 to evaluate demand for transport and prospects for strengthening multimodal \nlinkages.3  \n \n8.  A  comprehensive  study  of  the  transport  sector  for  the  GMS  is  needed  for  several \nreasons. First, the recommendations of the 1995 GMS Transport Master Plan have been largely \novertaken  by  physical  investment,  general  changes  in  policy,  economic  development  and \ntechnological advances. A study is needed to highlight national and regional activities required \nto develop transportation networks. Second, sustained population and economic growth over \nthe past decade has increased the demand for transport services and the complexity of the \nrequisite  transport  systems.  This  issue  requires  systematic  analysis  and  response.  Third, \nefficient transport networks have become more important to regional cooperation, in absolute \nand relative terms, as tariff-based barriers to economic cooperation have declined in general. At \nthe same time, the proportion of labor costs to total cost of manufactured exports has declined. \nGMS countries that have capitalized on their low labor costs, therefore, need to develop other \nadvantages such as reliable, low-cost transport. Improved competitiveness will depend critically \non the ability to establish connectivity and an efficient transport network. Improved transport \nsystems and logistics are needed to deepen GMS cooperation, particularly in marketing the \nsubregion as a single tourism destination and as a market and site for regional networks of \nconsumption and production. Improved transportation networks are needed to link GMS and \n                                                 \n3  Management approval was obtained on 3 March 2004 for circulation to the Board for an informal Board seminar, \nheld on 26 March 2004. ", "  3\nnon-GMS  countries  such  as  via  a  landbridge  between  South  Asia  and  the  Association  of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN)-PRC free trade area.4 \n \n9.  ADB has long experience in providing a broad range of services in different sectors to \nGMS countries as financier, provider of technical advice, catalyst for mobilizing assistance, and \nneutral moderator among the six countries. ADB is, therefore, in a unique position to implement \nthis study, which addresses a broad range of complex and sensitive issues, in full collaboration \nwith the GMS countries.  \n \nIII.   THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.   Purpose and Output  \n \n10.  The  TA  objective  is  to  develop  a  clear  vision  and  a  comprehensive  strategy  for \ndevelopment of a GMS transport network that will promote the subregion\u2019s connectivity and \ncompetitiveness. This objective will be achieved chiefly by developing a GMS-wide multimodal \ntransport  system.  The  TA  will,  based  on  a  careful  analysis  of  the  situation  and  likely \ndevelopments, identify transport projects, policies, programs, and institutions, which the six \nGMS countries agree, are needed to promote economic cooperation. The key components of \nsuch a transport network include (i) major trade corridors between GMS countries, (ii) gateways \nlinking GMS countries to the rest of the world, (iii) transit trade across GMS countries, and \n(iv) development of border areas of adjoining GMS countries. The TA will identify the priorities \nwithin each transport mode and across different modes, sequencing identified interventions and \nfinancial resources required, likely sources of these resources, and institutional arrangements, \nincluding public-private partnerships. The TA is expected to lead to (i) identification of a pipeline \nof transport projects and programs that will help create an integrated GMS transport network, \n(ii) mobilization of resources needed to finance these projects from the private as well as public \nsectors, and (iii) policies and institutions that will lead to the creation and sustaining of an \nefficient  GMS  transport  network.  The  TA  will  provide  the  GMS  countries  with  a  common, \nmedium-term, regional framework within which their own national activities can be planned and \nimplemented. The TA output will also provide development partners with an objective basis for \ninformed decision making with respect to programming and financing. \n \nB.   Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  Given the complex requirements and long-term nature of the development of a GMS \ntransport network, the TA will be comprehensive and forward looking. It will cover 2006\u20132015. \nThe 10-year study is long enough that meaningful strategies can be made and implemented but \nnot so long that technical changes and progress will dramatically alter the environment and \nparameters in which the strategies are drawn up. \n \n12.  The TA is comprehensive in a number of ways. First, it covers all six GMS countries. \nSecond, while it looks at the future, the analysis will build on the achievements of the first \ndecade of cooperation. Third, the TA covers all the major transport modes that are likely to be of \nimportance in the GMS in the medium term: road, rail, civil aviation, and ports and inland water \nnavigation. The TA will also be comprehensive in that it will look at the subregional demand for \ntransport services for goods and passengers as well as the constraints of the supply side. The \nsupply  of  transport  infrastructure  will  remain  an  important  aspect  of  the  TA,  given  the \n                                                 \n4  The landbridge is a road link from Thailand to northeastern India via Myanmar. The ASEAN-PRC free trade area \nwill come into effect in 2010 for most GMS countries. All GMS countries, except the PRC, are now members of \nASEAN. \n ", "4  \nwidespread physical gaps and absence of linkages within each mode as well as across modes \nin  the  GMS.  Supply-side  analysis  will  be  important  in  identifying  new  transport  routes, \nparticularly between the GMS and geographically contiguous economic partners. However, as \nscarce financial and human capital resources should be used efficiently, the TA will use a traffic \nnetwork model to examine the likely regional demand for transport services on the basis of \nseveral key variables, including the following: (i) demographic growth and dispersion, (ii) major \neconomic  trends  such  as  increasing  economic  ties  between  ASEAN  and  PRC,  (iii)  the \nemergence  of  regional  production  networks  within  the  GMS,  (iv)  movement  of  \u201csunset\u201d \nindustries  within  Southeast  Asia,  (v)  further  development  of  the  GMS  as  a  single  tourist \ndestination, and (vi) subregional and bilateral cooperation initiatives among the GMS countries. \n \n13.  The TA will address equity and cross-cutting social issues and negative externalities \nsuch  as  increased  incidence  of  HIV/AIDS,6  traffic  accidents,  and  pollution,  which  may  be \nassociated with the development of transport networks. The distribution of costs and benefits of \nthe transport network among countries, as well as different income and demographic groups \nwithin countries, will be considered. Nongovernment organizations and civil society will be \nconsulted early and throughout the study cycle so that relevant interventions may be identified. \n \n14.  The TA will examine how integrated transport networks have been developed in regional \ncooperation programs elsewhere (e.g., European Union, Southern Africa, Latin America), and \nassess the possibility of adapting them to the GMS context. \n \n15.  On the basis of the above factors and through a process of full consultation with all \nmajor stakeholders (governments, private sector, development partners, and civil society), the \nTA will identify a vision for a GMS transport strategy and the priority project, program, policy, \nand institutional interventions that will be required to create a GMS-wide transport network. \nConsultation will be important in ensuring maximum support for the study recommendations as \nwell as ensuring consistency of development plans between countries, within each country, and \nbetween national and regional plans. The TA outputs will be disseminated by a variety of means \n(Web sited, in-country workshops, electronic reports, easily accessible brochures) to maximize \nthe general acceptance of the strategy and attract financing from public and private sources. \nKey outputs may be translated into selected GMS languages, depending on demand and need.  \n \nC.   Cost and Financing  \n \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated of $950,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on \na grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. Cost estimates are in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.   Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The Infrastructure Division (MKID) of \nMekong  Regional  Department  (MKRD)  will  take  the  lead  in  implementing  the  TA  in  full \ncollaboration and consultation with other departments involved in GMS Program activities. A \nsteering committee will be established within MKRD to ensure output quality. The steering \ncommittee will be supported by a subregional transport specialist acting as a resource person \nthat will be hired for 3 months, intermittently. A small TA secretariat will be established within \nMKID to ensure smooth coordination between and among the countries, consultants, and ADB, \nas well as to help produce reports and disseminate them on time. The secretariat will closely \ncoordinate  with  the  GMS  countries,  each  of  which  will  establish  a  focal  group  to  ensure \nownership of the resulting study and facilitate interministerial discussion on TA implementation \n                                                 \n6  human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. ", "  5\nand findings.7 Coordination with other development partners involved in promoting regional \neconomic cooperation and/or related activities will be pursued to avoid duplication of effort.  \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented by an international consulting firm under close supervision \nof ADB staff members. ADB will select and engage the consultant in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. The TA will be implemented over approximately 12 \nmonths, from January to December 2005; 28 person-months of international consulting inputs \nare anticipated to be required, involving seven international consultants. Domestic consultants \nmay be engaged for a total of 6 person-months in selected GMS countries. The outline terms of \nreference for the consultant are in Appendix 4.  \n \n19.  An initial round of fact-finding by the team leader and ADB staff to selected GMS \ncountries will be conducted over 2 weeks, starting in January 2005, to clarify project objectives, \nimplementation arrangements, and governments\u2019 role. After the visit, the consultant team will be \nfielded. The consultant will focus on three key aspects: (i) forecasting demand for subregional \ntraffic by mode and route of transport; (ii) reviewing the efficiency, safety, and adequacy of \ntransport supply, and identifying institutional, legal, regulatory, and operational improvements; \nand (iii) identifying likely transport infrastructure bottlenecks; to form the basis for formulating a \nprioritized, medium-term transport infrastructure investment plan in 2006\u20132015. \n \n20.  An interim report presenting an assessment of GMS achievements, a proposed strategy \nto develop the GMS transport system, and a tentative long list of preliminarily identified projects \nand prioritization criteria will be submitted to the GMS countries in mid-April 2005. These will be \ndiscussed  at  a  workshop  of  senior  officials  of  the  GMS  countries  before  submission  and \nendorsement by high-level government authorities at the GMS transport sector forum in Beijing, \nPRC, scheduled for May 2005. Based on the forum\u2019s outcome, the consultant will elaborate a \nprioritized plan to develop an efficient and internationally competitive transport network linking \nthe GMS and its neighbors. Throughout, the consultant will keep close counsel with the focal \ngroups established in each GMS country to ensure national ownership and full coordination with \nnational transport and investment planning. The consultant\u2019s draft final report will be issued in \nSeptember 2005 for review by ADB and the GMS countries, and will subsequently be discussed \nat a senior transport officials\u2019 meeting tentatively scheduled for October 2005. The final report \nwill be issued in December 2005. \n \nIV.   THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.

The first will be from January to April \n2005, when an interim report containing an assessment of GMS achievements, a proposed \nstrategy to develop the GMS transport sector, and a long list of proposed interventions and \nprioritization  criteria  will  be  submitted  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  GMS \ncountries. This first phase will be initiated by a 2-week fact-finding mission to selected GMS \ncountries  to  help  fine-tune  the  study  methodology.  The  mission  will  consist  of  ADB  staff \nmembers in charge of the study, and the team leader.  \n4.  Analysis of demand-side factors and supply-side constraints affecting the establishment \nand effectiveness of a GMS transport network will be emphasized in the first phase. The second \nphase will be from May to September 2005, when the draft final report will be presented to ADB \nand the GMS countries. \n5.  The work sequence of the study team is as follows: \n(i)  Phase I will consist of the following: \n \n(a)  assessment of GMS achievements and outstanding challenges; \n(b)  modeling of derived demand for transport services based on projected \nlevels of economic activity and trade, particularly along major economic \ncorridors; \n(c)  assessment of the factors that will affect the performance of different \nmodes and the corridors as multimodal routes; and \n(d)  preparation  of  a  draft  strategy  to  strengthen  GMS-wide  transport \nefficiency and accessibility, and of an associated long list of proposed \ninterventions  and  prioritization  criteria  to  develop  a  GMS  transport \nnetwork. \n \n(ii)  Phase II will consist of the following:   \n \n(a)  prioritization of strategic projects and policy initiatives required to develop \na GMS transport network; \n(b)  detailed  formulation  and  evaluation  of  investment  projects  and  policy \ninitiatives; and  \n(c)  dissemination of the study results to targeted audience.  \n \n6.
