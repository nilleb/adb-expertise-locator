INTRODUCTION\n1. At the request of the Government, a technical assistance (TA) Fact-finding\nMission visited the Maldives from 1 to 6 June 1996 to examine the possibility of'the Bank\nproviding TA to develop the institutional capacity of the Audit Office. The Mission reached an\nunderstanding with Government representatives on the justification and priority for the TA its\nobjectives and scope, and implementation details including the terms of reference of the TA\nconsultants.1 The TA conforms with the Bank's country operational strategy which includes the\nimprovement of fiscal management as one of three strategic objectives for Maldives.\nII.\t BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. Accounting functions provide economic entities with the basis for controlling the\nuse of resources, while auditing functions measure the effectiveness and efficiency of their\naccomplishments. Both functions are necessary for every sector of the economy, particularly in\nthe Maldives, where there has been a rapid increase in finance, tourism, trade, and economic\nactivities. The Maldives Audit Office was established in 1949; its responsibilities have evolved to\ninclude examining and auditing all accounts of Government departments and public enterprises\npertaining to receipts and expenditures and the use of Government property, developing and\nimplementing of effective internal controls for Government audits, and making\nrecommendations for the improvement of internal control and the accounting system\nmaintained by the Ministry of Finance and Treasury. The Audit Office is under the direct\nresponsibility of the President's Office. The goals of the Audit Office are to help strengthen\nmanagement accountability throughout the public administration, verify that the assets of public\nbodies and subsidiaries are safeguarded and controlled, mobilize and continue the use of\navailable assets in a cost-effective manner, and carry out the general financial operations of\nGovernment effectively. The Audit Office is a member of the International Organization of\nSupreme Audit Institutions and is currently proceeding with an application to join the Asian\nOrganization of Supreme Audit Institutions.\n3. The Government is attempting to improve accounting and auditing standards for\nits operations arid to standardize these operations in line with other countries in the region.\nStudies conducted by the United Nations Development Programme and Bank missions have\nhighlighted the need for more effective financial management and the development of human\nresources to enhance financial control and accountability on the part of the Government. There\nis, however, a severe shortage of qualified personnel to carry out the required improvements.\nThis staff shortage prevails in virtually every economic sector. Improvement in the supply of\nskilled workers has been evident since the introduction of accounting studies in the school\ncurriculum for the \"0\" and \"A\" levels. However, to meet current demand, the Government has\ncontracted expatriate professionals in the fields of accounting, finance, and banking, incurring\nsubstantial charges for audits of State-owned enterprises.\n4. In 1987, the Audit Office had a staff of 84. Its role then involved, in addition to the\nfunction of Government external auditor, monitoring and control of the Government budget.\nThis put considerable strain on the very limited workforce, and hampered the effectiveness and\nindependence of the Audit Office as an external auditor, considering its limitations and lack of\neffectively trained personnel. The Audit Office now has 60 staff and is not involved in\naccounting duties. Its policy is to recruit staff who have completed the 0\" and A\" evels; have\nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in December 1996\ni\t ci", "2\nundertaken accounting and commercial studies for the Association of Accounting Technicians\n(AAT) examinations; and are proficient in English. At present, 60 percent of the Audit Office\nstaff have passed the '0\" and 'A\" levels in accounting and are undertaking further studies\nthrough AAT. Regular in-house on-the-job training has also commenced in accounting and\nauditing, conducted by the Assistant Director of Audit, Planning, Research and Development,\nwho has returned after graduating overseas as a qualified accountant.\n5. The Maldives received assistance from the Commonwealth Fund for Technical\nCooperation (CFTC) from 1985 to 1987 to improve the capability of the Audit Office. Staff\nshortages and limited skill levels prevented the assistance from being fully effective. However,\nin recent years the quality of Audit Office staff have improved. At the same time, the demand\nfor auditing functions has increased significantly. Further support to strengthen the Office is\ntherefore not only timely, but has much better prospects for effective and sustainable impact. In\nthe Government sector the financial management and control system, the regulation of the\naccountancy profession, and accounting education and training are all in the very basic stages\nof development. There is no existing legal framework for the comprehensive regulation of local\ncompanies and foreign investors, and internationally accepted banking practice is used in the\nabsence of a Maldives banking law, which is still under formulation.\n6. There remain several key constraints to the effective and efficient operation of\nthe Audit Office: a shortage of skills, insufficient skill development, use of single-entry\naccounting, and implementation of accounting and auditing standards and regulations.\n7. The Government is standardizing and developing generally accepted accounting\nand auditing standards to reduce the country's dependence on expatriate staff. The need for\nqualified expatriate professional accountants is evident in conducting the audit of companies\nsuch as the State Trading Organization through its commercial activities of importing, and\nwholesale and retail outlets; the Bank of Maldives Ltd., a public company; the Maldives\nTransport and Contracting Company; and the Maldives Electricity Board. These are complex\noperations that require experience to conduct the audit and to prepare financial statements and\nreports. Auditing of these more complex operations is presently being conducted by three\nprivate international accounting firms that have auditors skilled in finance, banking, and trading\ncompany operations.\n8. There is a shortage of financial skills in the Audit Office. It appears that this\nproblem can be reduced to manageable levels in the medium term, but that the Government will\nhave to rely on private auditing firms to undertake some public sector auditing tasks. The use of\nprivate auditing firms can be expensive in the long run, with no benefits of training or transfer of\ntechnology to the Audit Office, The Government will need to improve the formal and nonformah\neducation systems to produce a larger number of persons with relevant skills. One option is to\nenhance the Maldives Centre for Management and Administration (MCMA), 1 which was\nestablished in 1991 to promote skill development in the fields of accounting, auditing, and\ntinancial management. MCMA runs certificate and diploma courses in accounting and auditing\nthrough the AAT courses and the basics of financial management This nonformal training unit\nis able to achieve the Government's immediate needs for accounting staff at the technician\nlevel.2 With additional strengthening MCMA could meet the higher level accounting and\nApproved in August 1996 as an assessment center by AAT.\nTo date MCMA has trained 67 accounting technicians to the certificate level, and 25 to the\ndiploma , or intermediate level. In December 1996, a further 65 students sat for the certificate\nvj\t LI I lyLi II III 19\t I\t 'LUUI LII I\t dl IU dUUIL LI diIlI iy pi UIdFfl\t III III\t IOFF!1I", "3\nauditing needs of the Government Assistance to MCMA has included overseas fehowships,\nequipment, and classrooms financed by the World Bank since 1994, and materials and staff\nfrom CFTC from 1992 to 1996.\n9. The present accounting system, based on single-entry recording, is not practical\nand does not allow proper analysis of financial information. With the increasing use and\navailability of computers in the country and with various accounting software packages currently\nused in the State-owned public enterprises, the Government has phased out the single-entry\nmethod of accounting and introduced the double-entry systeni For greater accuracy. and to\novercome the staffing problem of using manually maintained records, the Government is now\nusing computers and software applications to enhance its accounting and auditing work.\n10. In 1992, the Office of the President updated the Government Regulations\npertaining to accounting, the control of Government assets, and procurement. At present, the\nstandards and regulations governing the conduct of public accounting and audit are not subject\nto scrutiny by a regulatory accounting body. The Government has instructed the Audit Office to\nintroduce standards acceptable to both the country and international organizations and to form\na regulatory body to implement accounting standards in line with those of other countries in the\nregion. Although there is no national accounting body or regulatory framework at present for the\ncontrol and registration of public accountants and auditors, the Office of the President has given\ninstructions that the Audit Office is to assist in forming a regulatory body to control the\nregistration of accountants and auditors in the country.\n11. Sustainable developments have taken place in the areas of accounting, auditing,\nand management training at the postsecondary level within the country with the establishment\nof MCMA (see para. 8) and the use of English as a medium of instruction. This accredited\ntraining unit is able to achieve the Government's immediate needs of developing accounting\nstaff at the technician level. The increasing use of English by public enterprises, commercial\nbanks, and the international business community has resulted in a significantly higher demand\nfor proficiency in English among Audit Office staff. In response, the Audit Office has now\ncommenced recruiting school leavers proficient in English.\n12. Providing assistance to strengthen financial accounting and auditing is consistent\nwth the Bank's development objectives of governance for its developing member countries In\nthe case of the Maldives, the need to improve financial accountability is urgent. The Bank's\ninvolvement comprises provision of experts to assist in strengthening the Audit Office by\ntraining, introduction of improved operational procedures, computerization and helping to\ndevelop national audit standards and regulations.\nIll.
