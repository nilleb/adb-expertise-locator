The proposed technical assistance (TA) subproject is part of the approved transaction TA \ncluster1 designed to complement the approved loan2 of up to $100,000,000 to Olam International \nLimited (OIL) and two of its subsidiaries. The loan is supporting the $223,000,000 capex and \nexpansion plan of OIL and its subsidiaries (Olam) over the 2017-2019 period and invest in Olam\u2019s \nmidstream processing assets and permanent working capital for smallholder farmer supply in \nIndonesia, Timor-Leste, Papua New Guinea (PNG), and Viet Nam.3 The project will promote \ninclusive and sustainable agricultural value chains with higher local value addition in Southeast \nAsia and the Pacific. The TA subproject will complement the loan by providing capacity building \nsupport to 3,500 smallholder coffee farmers that Olam sources from in Viet Nam.  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUBPROJECT \n \nA.  Overall Progress of the Technical Assistance Cluster \n \n2.  The TA cluster was approved on 18 December 2017. Subproject 1 was approved on 18 \nDecember  2018  and  Subproject  2  was  approved  on  10 May  2018.  For  Subproject  1,  the \nrecruitment of the consulting firm is currently underway and the expected commencement date is \n15 February 2020. For Subproject 2, Landell Mills Limited was retained as the consultant. The \ncommencement date for Subproject 2 is 19 November 2018 and the project will be completed by \n14 May 2021.  \n \nB.  Subproject Scope \n \n3.  The TA subproject will help smallholder coffee farmers in Viet Nam fully benefit from their \ninclusion in the coffee value chain by improving the productivity and quality of crops, and meeting \ninternational certification standards. The subproject will also ensure that these farmers are better \nprepared to cope with the negative consequences of climate change. The scope of the TA \nsubproject will be limited to the activities of the TA cluster in Viet Nam.  \n \nC.  Subproject Outputs and Activities \n \n4.  Impacts and outcome of the TA subproject are in line with the financing project. Impacts \nare: (i) double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers through \ninputs, knowledge, markets, and opportunities for value addition and non-farm employment, (ii) \nensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient agricultural practices that \nincrease productivity and production, that help maintain ecosystems, that strengthen capacity for \nadaptation to climate change, and (iii) significant increase in the exports of developing countries. \nThe major outputs and activities are summarized in Table 1.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1  ADB. 2017.

Subproject Cost and Financing \n \n5.  The TA subproject is estimated to cost $300,000 of which $260,000 will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-6)  and  $40,000,  for  the \ncomponents related to climate change adaptation, will be financed by the Canadian Climate Fund \nfor  the  Private  Sector  in  Asia  under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing  Partnership  Facility  and \nadministered by ADB.  \n \nE.  Subproject Implementation Arrangements \n \n6.  ADB will administer the TA subproject from April 2020 to September 2022. Olam will be \nthe recipient of the TA subproject as Olam is best positioned to coordinate the work of the \nconsulting firms and share learning with farmers, the government, and other stakeholders in the \n ", "3 \nproject countries. Because of Olam sources from the smallholder farmers directly or through local \nbuying agents, the company has a relationship with farmers and will ensure that they fully benefit \nfrom the TA subproject. The interests of Olam and the farmers are aligned in relation to the TA \nsubproject outcome, since if smallholder coffee farmers grow more, at a better quality, Olam \ncontinues to satisfy customer demand for high-quality, sustainable products. Olam has the \nfinancial  and  administrative  capacity  to  provide  the  required  in-kind  contributions  to  the \nconsultants and ensure successful implementation of the TA subproject.  \n \n7.  Olam  and  ADB  have  agreed  to the  terms of a  draft  TA  subproject  implementation \nagreement. The draft agreement sets out the outcome and outputs of the TA subproject, the \namount of financing to be provided by ADB, the terms of reference of the consulting firm to be \nappointed, the proposed budget, and a realistic implementation timetable. \n \nTable 2: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative  April 2020\u2013September 2022 \nimplementation period \nExecuting agency  ADB \nImplementing agency  Olam \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nFirm:  Inclusive and Climate  Quality and Cost- $300,000 \nResilient Coffee Value Chain          Based Selection \n Subproject 3: Viet Nam \nEquipment  The consulting firms will be in charge of procuring the equipmenta required for the TA  \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).

Improving productivity and price realization can have a significant \nimpact on household incomes. However, many smallholder producers are constrained by gaps in \nknowledge and understanding of good agricultural practices, limited financial inclusion, difficulties \nin  accessing  high  quality  inputs  and  technical  advice,  poor  transport  links  and  market \ninfrastructure, and continued dependence on middlemen.  \n \nIn Viet Nam, the consequences of heavy use of fertilizer and other agro-chemicals range from \ndeforestation and fishery resource depletion, to a growing incidence of land degradation and \nwater pollution.7 Climate change is also a growing challenge and poses a serious threat to long \nterm sustainability. Viet Nam has been listed as one of the five countries that will be worst-affected \nby climate change given its high exposure to floods and storms.8  \n \nTA support to households will be anchored on a holistic climate-smart agriculture training program \nincluding  training  sessions,  field  trials,  and  demonstration  plots.  Productivity  and  quality \nimprovement, environmental sustainability of production, farmer organization, and household \nfinancial management will be key focus areas, which will help build suppliers\u2019 understanding of \nand adherence to the Olam Supplier Code.9 The TA will help to establish local level farmer \nmanaged demonstration plots to clearly demonstrate the impact of specific farm management \npractices.  These  demonstration  plots  will  form  part  of  a  broader  network  of  farm  level \ndemonstration plots that is envisaged under Timor-Leste\u2019s coffee sector development plan. They \nwould be comparable to the farmer demonstration plots that have been established by World \nCoffee Research and aligned with the frameworks and principles that have been established by \nthe Government of Timor-Leste and relevant industry stakeholders.  \n \nTA support to smallholders will be organized and monitored using the Olam farmer management \ninformation system (OFIS), an innovative mobile technology platform that is being developed by \nOlam. This will facilitate initial baseline data collection on household and farm characteristics, \nongoing recording of training and extension activities, periodic surveys of farm conditions to track \nchanges  over  time,  the  development  of  personalized  farm  management  plans,  and  the \nimplementation of farm and household level certifications. The deployment of OFIS will be a \nsignificant innovation for Timor-Leste and will facilitate rigorous monitoring and evaluation.  \n \nSeveral steps will be taken to maximize the benefits of the initial roll-out of OFIS. The TA will \nsupport  evaluation  of  the  relative  effectiveness  of  different  training  approaches  and \n \n7  World Bank. 2016.

The TA will \nalso include specific interventions to help the Government of Viet Nam and other industry \nstakeholders to build a clear understanding of the technology and its broad capabilities, and to \nformally assess the potential to apply OFIS or a similar system across the industry.  \n \nDelivery of TA-funded training and extension services will be closely coordinated with the Ministry \nof Agriculture and Fisheries to avoid duplication of efforts and support continued development of \nthe public extension service. The knowledge and learning that is emerging from TA activities will \nalso be regularly shared with other industry stakeholders. This will help to leverage the impact of \nTA activities by facilitating information exchange between sector stakeholders and encouraging \nbroader uptake of successful approaches.  \n \nThe TA will also encourage institution building and establishment of industry standards in Viet \nNam through the development of coffee grading systems and unified information management \nsystem. The TA is a piggyback TA which will help realize the projected impact of the financing \nproject. The TA will help farmers be included in the global coffee supply chain by helping them \nadopt sustainable farming practices and increasing their production and quality, and ultimately, \nincome. \nA.  Scope of Service \n \nThe project will be designed around the registration of 3,500 new farmers into the Olam Farmer \nInformation System (OFIS). This requires building on-the-gournd relationships with farmers and \ncollecting data through a baseline and annual surveys. Information collected should be used to \ndesign training programs including Good Agricultural Practices, Integrated Pest Management, \nand Climate Smart Agriculture. The setting up and running of a series of coffee demo plots will \nprovide accurate information on local coffee growing conditions, thus informing training content \nand providing training sites for farmers.  \n \nFarm level demonstration plots will be broadly modelled a World Coffee Research methodology \nbeing used locally, with the following characteristics:  \n(i)  Located on individual farmers\u2019 land and broadly representative of size / growing \nconditions faced by other farmers in the immediate vicinity;  \n(ii)  Managed according to a design that is centrally coordinated and that involves \n\u2018side-by-side\u2019 application of different treatments / practices.  \n(iii)  Supported by careful data collection and monitoring to enable clear evaluation of \nthe economic returns of different \u2018improvements\u2019 or changes in farming practices.  \n(iv)  Providing  clear  visual  evidence  to  nearby  farmers,  and  micro-data  for  more \naggregated analysis.  \n \nOFIS will be used to generate individual farm management plans and the project will supply inputs \nand advice to implement these effectively. Improvements in productivity, coffee quality and farmer \nlivelihoods are key measures of success. (Organic) certification and/or OLC certification may be \nuseful tools for delivering/measuring these.  \n \nThe firm will report to the ADB project officer through the assignment team leader and will perform \nthe following: \n \n1.
