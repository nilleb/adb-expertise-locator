During  the  2006  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested a technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to help the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) in promoting a \nresource-efficient society. The TA is included in the country program for 2007.1 The Fact-\nFinding Mission fielded in March 2007 reached an understanding with the Government on the \nimpact and outcome, methodology and key activities, scope, cost estimates, financing plan, and \nimplementation  arrangements  of  the  TA.  The  TA  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The sustained high economic growth rate of 9% over the past 30 years in the PRC has \nlifted 450 million people out of absolute poverty. Its economy now ranks fourth in the world, with \na large demand for commodities (agricultural and raw materials), water, and energy. The high \ndomestic  savings  rate  has  enabled  large  investments  to  increase  domestic  capacity  and \ninfrastructure services, but imports have risen gradually to meet the demand. With further \nincreases in incomes, the demand for energy and items that consume much energy like steel, \ncement, copper, aluminum, fertilizers, chemicals, etc., is expected to continue rising and exert \nconsiderable  pressure  on  natural  resources  and  the  environment.  Urbanization  and  the \nincreased use of passenger cars also contribute to increased per capita energy consumption.  \n \n3.  The Government\u2019s \u201cGuidelines of the 11th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and \nSocial Development\u201d (11FYP Guidelines) recognizes the phenomenal economic development \nduring the 10FYP but also identifies some emerging binding constraints. Farmland, fresh water, \nenergy, and important mineral resources are relatively insufficient; the ecology is vulnerable; the \nstructure of the economy does not adequately support efficient resource utilization; and about          \n9  million  new  jobs  have  to  be  created  annually.  The  capacity  for  scientific  research  and \ntechnological  innovation  needed  to  increase  productivity  is  still  limited.  The  Government \nrecognizes the need for optimal use of its limited resources and aims to achieve high economic \ngrowth in a sustainable manner in the 11FYP.  \n \n4.  The PRC quadrupled its per capita gross domestic product (GDP) while only doubling \nenergy consumption during the 20 years from 1980 to 2000. To achieve a similar improvement \nand address some of the developmental constraints, the 11FYP, 2006\u20132010 has obligatory \ntargets.  These  include  (i)  a  20%  reduction  in  energy  consumption  per  unit  of  GDP;                        \n(ii) a 10% reduction in the total emission of major pollutants, namely, sulfur dioxide that is linked \nto the use of coal, and chemical oxygen demand that is linked to industrial effluents; and                    \n(iii) a 30% reduction of water consumption per unit of industrial value added. It also anticipates \nthe utilization of industrial solid waste to increase from 55.8% to 60%. Achieving these targets is \na  serious  challenge  requiring  a  focused  approach,  particularly  toward  energy  conservation               \n(to reduce pollution) and energy efficiency. \n \n5.  The Government has issued other decrees and plans that support the 11FYP guidelines. \nThe Renewable Energy Law became effective on 1 January 2006 and related implementing \ndecrees have been issued; these encourage the use of domestically available natural resources \nthat have low environmental impact. NDRC issued the China Medium- and Long-Term Energy \nConservation Plan that identifies 10 key areas where to reduce energy consumption. The State \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 23 February 2007. \n ", "2   \nCouncil also issued in August 2006 a decree to enhance energy conservation. The 11FYP \nguidelines, which target the reduction of energy consumption, have been disaggregated and \ncommunicated to provincial governments, and the Top-1,000 Program launched in April 2006 \nrequires  the  industrial enterprises that  account  for  about  33%  energy  use  to prepare  and \nimplement energy conservation measures.2 \n \n6.  A  sound  energy  conservation  evaluation  system  (ECES)  is  critical  for  success  in \nrealizing the full potential of conservation. Traditionally, energy has been measured for billing \nand technical purposes only, with aggregation done mostly for planning purposes. In most \ncountries, the most common and convenient form of energy\u2014electricity\u2014is billed after it has \nbeen consumed, a fact that does not promote practices to conserve. The new policies and \ntargets for energy conservation add another dimension\u2014an account of the output derived from \nenergy  use  (goods  or  service).  There  is  no  well-recognized  system  for  measuring  and \nevaluating  energy  conservation.  Leading  energy  research  institutes have  estimated  energy \nsavings in an economy over a period of time on the basis of broad assumptions. For example, \nthe International Energy Agency estimates that the world energy use in 1998\u201425 years after \nthe first oil shock of 1973\u2014would have been 49% higher without the savings realized; similarly, \nthe PRC would have consumed twice as much energy in 2000 compared to 1980 had energy \nintensity remained the same. Lack of disaggregated information makes it difficult to prepare new \nprograms to replicate these achievements. \n \n7.  There is an urgent need to develop a suitable ECES that is robust enough to hold \nentities accountable, as against a verification-less system that entities use voluntarily and do not \nexpect to be contested. The ECES should assist in planning energy reduction programs and \nmonitoring  implementation  progress,  as  against  ex  post  facto  reporting.  Government \ndepartments,  public  institutions  (education,  health,  transport),  enterprises  (commercial, \nindustrial) and even nongovernment organizations will need to report achievement of energy \nreduction targets, i.e., a comparison of energy used per unit of output in 2006 and 2010. To be \nable to do so equitably, the ECES has to specify boundaries for all types of entities; it must be \nfairly simple, user-friendly, and low cost to implement because of the limited learning time \navailable. \n \n8.  Although a measurement and verification system for energy conservation is not readily \navailable, it is possible to use features of comparable systems recently developed to account for \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emission, which is closely linked to energy use. The United Nations \nFramework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC)\u2014which  came  into  force  on                        \n21 March 1994 through an international treaty\u2014has issued guidelines for the preparation of \nGHG  inventories  by  developed  countries.  The  International  Standards  Organization\u2014the \nSwitzerland-based nongovernment organization that is a network of the national standards \ninstitutes of 157 countries, including the Standardization Administration of China, PRC\u2014has \nissued standards for quantifying and reporting GHGs at the organization level (14064-1:2006), \nat project level (14064-2:2006), and for their validation and verification (14064-3:2006). Like a \nfinancial accounting system, the GHG accounting system is designed to present a faithful, true, \nand fair account of a company\u2019s GHG emissions. The GHG Protocol also has calculation tools \nfor various industries and simple spreadsheet models with energy indices that are relevant for \nthe ECES. Adoption of a framework that is internationally recognized will strengthen the ECES \nand make it easier to migrate in the future to GHG accounting and reporting.  \n                                                 \n2  The top 1,000 enterprises consumed an aggregated 0.6 billion tons of coal equivalent in 2004, about 47% of the \ntotal energy consumption for the industry sector.    \n ", "  3\n9.  The Government has established an interministry steering committee, led by NDRC, to \nenforce initiatives to develop a resource-efficient society.3 To be effective within the short time \navailable,  it  requires  (i)  a  network  of  appropriate  institutions  that  can  contribute  to  the \nassessment  and  evaluation  of  resource  conservation;  (ii)  building  the  capacity  of  relevant \ninstitutions;  and  (iii)  specific  technical  means  and  tools  like  a  consolidated  resource \nconservation  evaluation  system  (RCES)  that  can  measure,  verify,  and  report  resource \nconservation  measures.  However,  it  recognizes  that  a  phased  approach  is  essential  in \ndeveloping  the  RCES.  Considering  energy  as  a  high-priority  resource,  an  ECES  will  be \ndeveloped and pilot-tested first, then expanded and replicated to include water and other raw \nmaterials in a consolidated RCES. The Government proposes to take the lead and demonstrate \nenergy conservation in selected central Government office buildings. It will also seek highly \nenergy-intensive  enterprises  (like  iron  and  steel,  and  cement  factories)  to  implement  pilot \nenergy conservation projects that can be replicated and scaled up. The demonstration and pilot \nprojects will provide directions for incentives (favorable tax and rebates) for promoting energy \nconservation.  \n \n10.  ADB launched the Energy Efficiency Initiative (EEI) in mid-2005 for decreasing the rate \nof climate change through increased use of sustainable energy forms. A significant outcome of \nthe EEI would be decreased energy intensity in industries, commercial buildings, municipalities, \nand the agriculture and transport sectors. Support to the PRC for developing the ECES and \nrelated capacity building will be within the EEI. Energy conservation and energy efficiency \nimprovements are key sector priorities in the country partnership strategy that is being finalized. \nADB  is  actively  engaged  in  Guangdong,  one  of  the  provinces  with  the  highest  energy \nconsumption, to develop an innovative energy efficiency project. The TA will complement the \nongoing ADB interventions.     \n  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The impact of the TA will be more efficient use of resources, i.e., raw materials, water, \nand  energy.  Its  outcome  will  be  enhanced  capacity  to  measure  and  evaluate  energy \nconservation and reduction in energy used per unit of GDP. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The outputs of the TA will be (i) an ECES and benchmark standards recommended for \nhighly energy-intensive enterprises and central Government office buildings; (ii) an investment \nplan for two pilot projects for demonstrating best practices cases for energy conservation;                        \n(iii) recommendations on the appropriate institutional setup for assessing and evaluating energy \nconservation;  and  (iv)  a  capacity-building  package,  including  training  modules,  information \nbrochures, training and communication programs, and an awareness campaign. \n \n13.  Experts from the Government Offices Administration of the State Council of the PRC, the \nStandardization  Administration  of  China,  the  Energy  Research  Institute,  and  energy \nconservation institutes will be consulted to understand current practices and identify pragmatic \noptions for monitoring energy conservation. Suitable criteria will be determined for selecting \n                                                 \n3 The scope of the NDRC-led committee includes conservation of raw materials for industrial production, water, and \nenergy. \n ", "4   \nsuitable government agencies and enterprise for the preparation of the demonstration and pilot \nprojects, which will be endorsed by the Government.  \n \n14.  The consultant will examine international best practices and methods that can be used in \ndeveloping the ECES, summarize the features, and make recommendations. The essential and \ndesirable features of the ECES will be listed at an early stage and consensus will be built on \nthem.  The  pilot  projects  will  target  selected  central  Government  office  buildings  and  an \nenterprise that is included in the Top-1,000 Program (para. 5). When a preliminary structure and \noutline  of  the  ECES  is  available,  consultants  will  use  the  information  flow  from  the \ndemonstration and pilot projects to further refine and develop the ECES. Suitable documents \nand  instruction  manuals  will  be  developed  to  enable  rapid  countrywide  deployment  of  the \ninformation system; a knowledge dissemination program will be implemented.  \n \n15.  Many international agencies and institutions, such as (i) Energy Foundation through the \nChina Sustainable Energy Program, (ii) European Union China: Energy and Environmental \nProgram, and (iii) French Global Environment Facility (EFEM), have launched complementary \nprojects to support the 20% reduction in energy consumption per unit of GDP. These programs \naim to address some components of the ECES. The consultants will review and assess the \ninformation, data, and output of these relevant studies and programs, and capture them in \npreparing the ECES and in drafting relevant recommendations.   \n \n16.  The major assumptions in relation to the successful implementation of the TA include              \n(i) continued emphasis on energy conservation, (ii) readiness of the Government to establish a \ntransparent and effective information system, (iii) significant participation by counterpart staff; \n(iv)  adequate  and  timely  provision  of  data,  and  (v)  active  participation  in  the  consultation \nworkshops and seminars. Since the ECES will be an innovation, the risk is that it may take \nconsiderable time and effort to arrive at a consensus on its design, and if it requires new \nprocedures to capture data, a longer time will be needed to train the field staff. The Government \nis fully committed to resource conservation and NDRC has been closely involved in developing \nthe required policies and guidelines. Close coordination among the consultants, executing and \nimplementing agencies, and ADB will be maintained during the implementation of the TA to \nensure  that  the  proposed  ECES  can  take  most  of  its  inputs  from  the  existing  system  for \ngathering energy-related information.4 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The total cost of the TA will be $550,000 equivalent, of which ADB will finance $400,000 \non a grant basis through the TA funding program. The Government will finance the remaining \n$150,000 equivalent through in-kind contribution, including office accommodation and facilities, \ncounterpart staff, and data and other information needed for the TA. The counterpart in-kind \ncontribution will be provided by NDRC or its assigned agency. The cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The Department of Resource Conservation and Environmental Protection of NDRC will \nbe the Executing Agency (EA) for the TA. The China Standards Certification Center will be the \nimplementing agency (IA) responsible for day-to-day implementation of the TA activities. \n \n                                                 \n4 A similar GHG protocol is being considered by NDRC to quantify, measure, and report entity-level emissions.  \n ", "  5\n19.  The EA will establish a counterpart team with representatives from Government Offices \nAdministration of the State Council of the PRC, the Standardization Administration of China, the \nEnergy Research Institute, and other relevant energy conservation institutes. The counterpart \nteam will interact closely with the consultants during implementation of the TA. The EA will also \nsubmit regular reports of the progress of implementation to the counterpart team and seek their \nguidance as required. The EA will provide interpreters and office space equipped with suitable \noffice facilities in Beijing. Some office equipment to be financed under the TA will be procured \nby the international consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time) and handed over to the EA upon completion of the TA. \n \n20.  ADB will engage an international consulting firm with experience in implementing similar \nenergy efficiency measurement systems, following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). ADB will request a simplified technical proposal and \nconsultants will be recruited using the quality- and cost-based selection method with quality-cost \nratio of 80:20. An estimated total of 35 person-months of consulting services will be required,            \n5  person-months  international  and  30  person-months  national.  The  following  international \nconsultants  will  be  required  (person-months  in  parentheses)  (i)  resource  economist  and \nresource conservation specialist (2.5), (ii) energy conservation standards specialist (1.5), and   \n(iii) institutional and public information specialist (1). The following national consultants will be \nrequired  (person-months  in  parentheses)  (i)  three  resource  economist  and  resource \nconservation specialists (4 each); (ii) two energy conservation standards specialists (4 each);            \n(ii) an institutional and public information specialist (4); (iv) a building energy conservation \nspecialist (3); and (v) an enterprise energy conservation specialist (3). The outline terms of \nreference for consultants are given in Appendix 3. \n \n21.  The TA will be implemented over 10 months beginning August 2007, with an expected \ncompletion  date  of  end-May  2008.  The  consultants  will  submit  an  inception  report  within             \n4 weeks, a midterm report within 16 weeks, a draft final report within 26 weeks, and the final \nreport within 36 weeks of field mobilization. Information on the progress of implementation and \non TA outputs will be disseminated through the TA information dissemination and awareness \nprogram. The outcome of the TA will be subject to evaluation by both ADB and the Government \nin accordance with their respective evaluation policies and requirements.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Promoting Resource Conservation and \nEnergy Efficiency, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risk \nMechanisms  \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nMore efficient use of  Reduction in energy  National statistics   \u2022  The Government remains \nresources\u2014raw materials,  consumption per unit of  committed to achieving the \nwater, and energy  GDP by 20% by 2010 as  targets for resource \ncompared with 2005  conservation. \n \n\u2022  Required investments in \nReduction in water \nresource conservation \nconsumption per unit of \nprojects are made by the \nindustrial value added by \nGovernment and \n30% by 2010 as compared \nenterprises. \nwith 2005 \n \n \nRisk \nSix scaled-up pilot projects \nreplicated in enterprises and  \u2022  Transfer of technologies to \ncommercial buildings  by  conserve resources is \n2010   slow. \n  \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nEnhanced capacity in  Adoption of ECES by   Report of National  \u2022  ECES is acceptable to \nmeasuring and evaluating   August 2008   Bureau of Statistics and  NDRC.  \nenergy conservation system     Standardization   \nFeasibility studies initiated  Administration of China  \u2022  Investments are made in \nfor  identified pilot projects    implementation of pilot \nby August 2008  Technical assistance  projects. \n  completion report    \nRecommended institutional    \u2022  Trained staff stay long \nsetup and capacity-building    enough to implement \nmeasures implemented by  ECES.  \nDecember 2008 \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \n1.
