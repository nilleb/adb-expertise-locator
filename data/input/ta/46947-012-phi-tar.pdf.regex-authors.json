INTRODUCTION \n1.  On 11 December 2009, the Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \napproved a $ 100 million  direct l oan  to K EPCO-SPC  Power C orporation ( KSPC)  for t he \n200 megawatt (MW) Visayas Base-Load Power Development Project in Naga City, Cebu.1 The \nADB facility agreement was signed on 4 M arch 2010. To date, KSPC has drawn a total of \n$86 million  from t he  ADB  loan  facility  and $ 14 m illion r emain undi sbursed.  KSPC\u2019s  loan \noutstanding to ADB is $69.2 million after the last principal repayment on 29 November 2012. \nCommercial operations commenced on 28 February 2011 for unit 1 and on 31 May 2011 for  \nunit 2. \n \n2.  Pursuant to a request for compliance review received by the ADB Compliance Review \nPanel (CRP) on 25 May 2011,2 which the CRP determined eligible for compliance review and \nwhich  was  subsequently aut horized b y t he B oard,  the  CRP  conducted an i nvestigation, \nincluding (i) document review; (ii) interviews with ADB staff, complainants, KEPCO Philippine \nHoldings and KSPC officers, and other resource persons; and (iii) a site visit. \n \n3.  Based on t he co mpliance r eview, t he C RP  concluded t hat nonco mpliance  existed \nregarding policies on the environment, public communications, and social dimensions in ADB \noperations. The CRP also concluded that the project was not fully compliant with ADB\u2019s Energy \nPolicy.3 \n \n4.  To  address  its  findings,  the  CRP  made  several  recommendations  that  the  Board \napproved  on  2  April  2012.  One  of  the  recommendations  is  for  ADB  to  (i)  undertake  a \ncomprehensive air dispersion modeling study that includes the key pollution sources in the \nproject area of influence and to validate the predictions with actual air emissions and ambient air \nquality m onitoring da ta,  (ii)  develop an act ion pl an base d on r ecommendations  from  the \nmodeling study, and (iii) emphasize the potential for continuous monitoring and recording of air \nemissions and ambient air quality. \n \n5.  The  proposed  sovereign  technical assi stance ( TA)  will  fund  the  (i)  air di spersion \nmodeling s tudy r ecommended by  t he C RP a nd appr oved by  t he B oard,  and  (ii)  capacity \ndevelopment of the local Department of Environment and Natural Resources office in Cebu \ncovering Region 7 (DENR-7), which will act as the executing agency. The study will include (i) \npreparation of an air pollutant emissions inventory for major sources; (ii) data collection of \npollutant emissions from major sources; (iii) ambient air quality monitoring, covering areas \nsurrounding  key so urces  of pol lution i n t he pr oject a rea;  (iv)  air  dispersion m odeling  and \nprediction to assess compliance with the national ambient air quality standards and to compare \nwith international guidelines (e.g., World Health Organization air quality guidelines for selected \n                                                \n1 2009. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan for the Visayas \nBase-Load Power Development Project in the Philippines. Manila \n2 The request claimed that the project would result in adverse impacts on  the health of residents and nearby \ncommunities resulting from (i) emissions of gases that could cause respiratory illnesses; (ii) spillage of coal during \ntransport, exposing residents to hazardous, toxic metallic elements; and (iii) seepage from the Balili coal ash \ndumpsite, which could contaminate marine life for human consumption. The request also claimed that ADB failed \nto comply with its Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), its Public Communications Policy (2011), and its policies on \nclean energy and public consultations and that the conduct of the environmental impact assessment and its \nsubsequent disclosure, including details on coal ash disposal, did not comply with ADB standards. \n3  ADB. 2009. Energy Policy. Manila \n ", "2 \n \nparameters); and (v) recommendations for mitigation and management measures to improve air \nquality in the project area.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n6.  The KSPC power plant is located in Naga City, which is the site of two other industrial \nfacilities\u2014Apo Cement owned by CEMEX and Naga Power Plant Complex4 operated by Salcon \nPower Corporation since 1994. These two plants, in addition to quarries and motor vehicles, \nmay be contributing to air pollution. Thus, air pollution in the project area cannot be attributed to \nthe KSPC project alone. The TA could provide valuable information on KSPC\u2019s cumulative \nimpact to air quality in the area. \n \n7.  The CRP interactions with the affected persons and the health records of affected \npersons  also  indicated  that  air  emissions  may  be  affecting  the  health  of  residents  of \ncommunities directly impacted. Given the concerns expressed by the local community about air \npollution and its impact on human health, the TA will (i) identify the major pollution sources in \nthe study area, (ii) determine the levels of emissions of air pollutants (NO , SO  and PM) and \n2 2\ncompare these with government emission standards5 or recommended international emission \nguidelines  or  levels6, (iii)  review  the  ambient  air quality data for compliance  with national \nambient air quality standards, (iv) interpret the study results (including the simulation findings) \nagainst the latest research findings of the World Health Organization and international health \nresearch institute, (v) propose, along with DENR and other major stakeholders, target air quality \nobjectives, and (vi) develop an air quality management plan for the study area.    \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n8.  Under the TA, the ambient air quality for selected parameters (particulate matters [PM  \n2.5\nand PM ], sulfur dioxide [SO ], and nitrogen dioxide [NO ]) will be monitored in the KSPC area, \n10 2 2\nand emissions will be measured and monitored from the three major industrial facilities\u2014the \nKSPC coal-fired power plant, the Naga Power Plant complex, and the Apo Cement plant. \nAutomatic, continuous monitoring and recording equipment for air emissions will be installed in \nthe smokestack of these facilities. Additional monitoring stations will be  installed in certain \nbarangays and other areas, as recommended by the consultant and agreed to with the local \nDENR office. Meteorological data will be generated simultaneously and used as input for the air \ndispersion  model.  If  the  results  of  ambient  air  quality  parameters  and  the  calibrated  air \ndispersion modeling study indicate violation of national ambient air quality standards, the study \nwill suggest mitigating and other measures for major polluters to reduce emissions. \n \n                                                \n4 The Naga Power Plant Complex consists of a 106 MW coal-fired plant and a 39 MW diesel-fired plant. \n5  Will apply also to companies of major point sources of pollution not funded by ADB. \n6 These international emission guidelines or levels, which are generally stricter than the government emission     \nstandards will only apply to the ADB-funded project in accordance with the Environment Policy (2002), and based \non the ADB-funded project environmental assessment. The Environment Policy prescribes that ADB follows the \nstandards  and  approaches  laid out  in  the World  Bank\u2019s  Pollution  Prevention and  Abatement  Handbook in \ndetermining appropriate environmental standards for ADB projects. This handbook describes generally acceptable \npollution prevention and abatement measures and emission levels. However, there is flexibility in the use of these \nemission guidelines or levels in that government emission standards will apply if the project environmental \nassessment justifies its use in view of, among others, project-specific circumstances and/or local conditions.  \n \n ", "    3 \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be controlled air pollution in Naga City and other industrial areas through \nthe replication of improved air quality monitoring measures by the local DENR office in Cebu. \nPerformance targets and indicators include emissions of NO2, SO2, PM10, and PM2.5 maintained \nwithin national ambient air quality standards and target air quality objectives to be set using \ninternational air quality guidelines in the KSPC area and other industrial areas covered by the \nlocal DENR office in Cebu, and secure baseline data on air quality in the project area. \n \n10.   The outcome will be the enhanced capacity of the local DENR office and selected \nqualified members of the project multipartite monitoring team and Airshed Governing Board7 to \nmonitor and mitigate air pollution in the project area. Performance targets and indicators include \ntraining of local DENR officials and possibly other qualified multipartite monitoring team and \nAirshed Governing Board members on improved air quality monitoring and government budget \nallocation for air quality monitoring. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The  TA w ill be st ructured ar ound  two out puts: ( i) co mpletion o f  the  air di spersion \nmodeling study; and (ii) agreement on measures, if necessary, to reduce air pollution to mitigate \nits adverse effects. To ensure the success of the TA, ADB, with the help of DENR-7 as the \nexecuting agency, will work closely with the major industrial facilities in the KSPC area and \nconsistently share with them and  their respective multipartite monitoring team, data collected \nfrom the air quality monitoring stations and findings of the air dispersion modeling study. Risks \nrelated to procurement of monitoring equipment and related hardware and software will be \nmitigated by seeking the advice of the TA consulting firm and through sound application of \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). To ensure the credibility \nof results, DENR-7, assisted by the consultant, will ensure that procedures for quality assurance \nand quality control are an integral part of the study.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,010,100, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, equipment, \nand other in-kind contributions.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The TA will be implemented over an estimated 18-month period, commencing April 2013 \nand ending on 31 October 2014. The success of the TA also depends on the full cooperation of \nthe industrial plants in the project area. DENR-7 will be the executing agency and will take \ncharge of liaising with the major industrial facilities in Naga City to secure their cooperation and \nparticipate in the study. An implementation agreement, setting out the responsibilities of the \nexecuting agency, will be executed between ADB and DENR-7. The executing agency will be \n                                                \n7  The Airshed Governing Board was formed by the local government of metropolitan Cebu to oversee and monitor \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguard  impact  of  the  operation  of  various  industrial  facilities  located  in  the \nmetropolitan  area.  The  Board  is  chaired  by  the  Regional  Director  of  DENR-7  and  its  members  include \nrepresentatives from the local government, the industrial facilities and certain civil society organizations. \n ", "4 \n \nprimarily responsible for (i) coordinating with the industrial facilities participating in the project; \nand (ii) monitoring and, when appropriate, providing guidance to the consulting firm.   \n \n14.  The TA will require an estimated 12 person-months of international consulting services. \nThe international consultant will have at least 10 y ears of experience in air quality modeling, \npreferably i n  the  power i ndustry, and   a  proven t rack  record o f unde rtaking ai r di spersion \nmodeling  on ai r em issions  from poi nt so urces.  The t erms  of  reference  are out lined i n \nAppendix 3. Consulting services will be  provided through a firm, recruited using quality- and \ncost-based selection at a ratio of 90:10 and a simplified technical proposal. The consulting firm \nwill be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as \namended from time to time).  \n \n15.  The consulting firm will guide ADB in identifying the equipment for the TA and will \nprocure the equipment for the project in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, \nas  amended from time to time). Installation  and  commissioning  will  be  carried  out  by the \nequipment supplier; the consulting firm will supervise these activities and test the equipment to \nensure its satisfactory operation. The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n16.  In addition to the above consulting services, ADB may also engage, on an intermittent \nbasis, an individual consultant for up to 3 months to assist ADB in reviewing the reports and the \nair dispersion modeling outputs to be submitted by the consulting firm. The individual consultant, \nto be hired through individual consultant selection, will have expertise and work experience in \nair  dispersion  modeling  studies.  Separate  terms  of  reference  will  be  prepared  for  this \nengagement if ADB requires it. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION  \n17.

Consistent with its objectives under Strategy 20201 and its country partnership strategy \nwith the Philippines2, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is committed to support projects that \nare environmentally sustainable and do not contribute to environmental degradation. In support \nof these objectives, ADB will undertake  capacity development technical assistance (TA) that \naims to ensure that the ADB-financed 200 megawatt (MW) coal-fired power plant owned and \noperated by KEPCO-SPC Power Corporation (KSPC) in Naga City, Cebu does not exacerbate \nair pollution in its project area. If the findings of the TA prove otherwise, ADB, together with the \nconsultant and the Executing Agency, will recommend measures that will mitigate possible air \npollution impacts in the KSPC area. ADB will recruit a consulting firm to monitor air emissions in \nthe KSPC area and undertake air dispersion modeling on air emissions from point sources. \nBased on the results of the air dispersion model, the consulting firm will recommend measures \nto mitigate air pollution. This project will require consultant services spread over 18 months \ncommencing in April 2013.
