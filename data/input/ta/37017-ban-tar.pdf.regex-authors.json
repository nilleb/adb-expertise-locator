The debate on good governance in Bangladesh has centered on corruption. The country \npersistently ranks low in international corruption perception surveys, and the general consensus \nwithin the country and among its development partners is that this is a serious concern that has \nto be addressed urgently. Corruption directly hinders development and poverty reduction, and \nthus the Government of Bangladesh (the Government) has made tackling it a key priority and \nhas requested assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n \n2.  To develop good governance, ADB provided advisory technical assistance (ADTA)1 in \n2003  to  support  the  structural  operationalization  of  the  Anticorruption  Commission  (ACC), \nincluding formulating rules for its operations. ADB is also considering project preparatory TA \nassistance in a parallel area of tackling corruption (focusing on legal and policy provisions, and \ngovernance audits and public expenditure tracking surveys in key subsectors). This proposed \nADTA will help the Government strengthen ACC so it can better fulfill its statutory mandates. \n \n3.  The Government has reviewed the ADTA proposal2 and has concurred with the project \nimpact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and \nterms of reference. Details are in Appendix 1 (design and monitoring framework).3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  General. Corruption is at the forefront of the debate on governance, development, and \npoverty reduction in Bangladesh. All facets of public life are widely perceived to be affected by \ncorruption.4 Development partners have emphasized that if the Government \u201cfails to eliminate \ncorruption\u2026 and to bring transparency in governance and improve it, it would be difficult for \nthem to continue assisting Bangladesh.\u201d5 The Government has thus made tackling corruption in \nthe public sector a key priority.6 \n \n5.  Anticorruption Commission. A key institutional focus of anticorruption efforts is ACC, \nwhich was established in 2004 with the passage of the ACC Act and the appointment of ACC \ncommissioners.  ADB  has  been  assisting  ACC  institutional  and  structural  operationalization \n(footnote 6). \n \n6.  However, the newly established entity has had teething problems, especially in retaining \nstaff from the now defunct Bureau of Anticorruption (BAC), as provided for under section 35(2) \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for Supporting Good Governance \nInitiatives. Manila (TA 4140-BAN, R128-03, approved on 10 July 2003). \n2 A Fact-Finding mission visited Dhaka on 9\u201316 November 2005, to consult with Government officials on the \nspecifications of the ADTA, and on the ADTA measures and costs related to its components. \n3 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 2 December 2005. \n4 See, e.g., The Daily Star. 2005. Politicians, traders, bureaucrats blamed for corruption: Citizens\u2019 Forum Against \nCorruption Launched. 9 November 9 (p. 3). \n5 See, e.g., The Daily Star. 2005. Rout graft, violence to get more assistance: Donors react to govt\u2019s plea at PRS \nForum. 16 November (p. 1). \n6 The importance of addressing the adverse impact of corruption on economic growth and poverty reduction is a \ncentral part of the Government\u2019s development strategy (Government of Bangladesh. 2005. Unlocking the Potential: \nNational Strategy for Accelerated Poverty Reduction. Dhaka; and ADB. 2005. Bangladesh CSP 2006\u20132010, Manila \n[paras. 33 and 36]). ADB has stressed that support for such anticorruption efforts is a key focus of its country \nstrategy and program (para. 55). Since 2003, ADB has supported Government anticorruption efforts by starting up \nACC through an ADTA (footnote 1); and ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh \nfor Supporting Good Governance Initiatives Proposed Change in Scope and Increase in Technical Assistance \nAmount. Manila (TA 4140-BAN, R314-04, approved on 16 December 2004). \n ", "2     \nof the ACC Act. A major problem stems from (i) ACC\u2019s loss of credibility if an unacceptably large \nnumber of ex-BAC staff members were to be retained after screening; and (ii) ongoing High \nCourt litigation on the screening process, thus far by screened-out ex-BAC staff, under which \nthe High Court has stayed the screening-out as well as issued a show cause order to ACC on \nthe screening-in. The litigation has meant that ACC cannot be fully operational. It has also \nhighlighted the importance of (i) early submission of an ACC organogram, (ii) early issuance of \nACC  rules  by  ACC,  and  (iii)  ACC  authorization  of  an  independent  committee  to  review \nscreened-in and screened-out ex-BAC staff.7 \n \n7.  Such human resource problems have been compounded by ACC\u2019s lack of capability at \ntwo levels. The senior management (class I functional level) is unable to effectively take up \ndelegated managerial aspects of work related to corruption, and the middle management lacks \nspecialized functional skills for day-to-day operational work. Given the paramount importance of \nstrengthening the upper echelons of ACC first (without relying on ex-BAC staff for reasons of \npublic perception and of problems in ex-BAC staff retention after screening), this ADTA focuses \non building the capacity of ACC\u2019s senior management and middle professionals. \n \n8.  ACC also lacks the operational effectiveness to address corruption cases, including \ninherited backlog8 from BAC, because it lacks the business process systems and databases to \nsupport an appropriate organizational structure.   \n \n9.  Lessons learned under the current TA on the structural operationalization9 challenges at \nACC (related to its ex-BAC staff screening, and development of an organogram and rules) \nsuggest that meaningful institutional development of ACC is critically dependent on a follow-up \ncapacity-building TA that will patiently pursue result-oriented institutional goals focused on (i) \ndevelopment of a senior and middle management cadre to enable delegated management of \noperational anticorruption responsibilities, (ii) development of a middle management cadre of \nprofessionals  with  technical  and  functional  skills  to  enable  ACC\u2019s  operational  professional \ncapability, and (iii) preparation of career planning for ACC staff linked to performance indicators \nand related incentives.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA\u2019s objective is to help create a more effective and efficient public sector with less \ncorruption and improved public confidence in Government institutions. The TA\u2019s outcome is \nACC\u2019s increased capacity and capability to fulfill its functions\u2014and to contribute to Government \nanticorruption programs\u2014through skilled human resources, greater clarity of functions, more \n                                                 \n7 The writ petitions of complainants argue, inter alia, that ACC had (i) formed committees consisting of ex-BAC staff \nmembers for the scrutiny process; (ii) employed certain ex-BAC staff members without framing rules under section \n35(2) of the ACC Act; (iii) excluded certain ex-BAC staff members from ACC employment without rules and scrutiny \ncriteria; and (iv) not formulated an administrative structure of ACC for posts so that, consequently, appointments \ncould not be made. In a roundtable meeting on 26 September 2005 in Dhaka, ACC, the Cabinet Division, and ADB \nagreed that an independent placement committee would be authorized within a month. In light of the High Court \nlitigation, it is now proposed that the ambit of such a committee be extended to include screened-in and screened-\nout ex-BAC staff members.    \n8  As of 2004, BAC had 16,000 cases under process, including 8,400 under inquiry, 3,000 under investigation, and \n4,500 cases in court. \n9  The  structural  operationalization  process  of  the  ACC  encompasses  (i)  screening  of  former  BAC  staff,  (ii) \ndevelopment of an ACC organogram, and (iii) development of ACC rules. \n ", "  3\nstreamlined business processes, modern equipment, and better understanding of the context \nand impact of corruption. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  Principles and Premises. The TA bases the proposed assistance on the premise that \n(i) notwithstanding the need for action on multiple fronts to combat corruption in the public \nsector,  concentrated  assistance  should  target  ACC;  and  (ii)  given  the  current  stage  of \nanticorruption efforts in the Government in general, and in ACC in particular, the TA needs to \ntarget expertise and corruption-specific knowledge at the senior and middle levels of ACC, to \nensure that ACC leaders will be more aware of the context of, and thus more enthusiastically \nsupport, any anticorruption program. \n \n12.  The TA will have two parts: (i) A: strengthening ACC human resources; and (ii) B: \nstrengthening ACC business process systems.  \n \n13.  Part  A:  Strengthening  ACC  Human  Resources.  To  address  skill  and  career \ndevelopment issues, the TA will (i) identify the capability and training needs of senior and middle \nstaff members;10 (ii) based on (i), train selected senior staff members to manage anticorruption \nstrategies and activities (by training the trainers);11 (iii) based on (i) and (ii), train selected middle \nstaff members to enable ACC\u2019s operational technical and professional capability; and (iv) design \nan institutional action plan based on result-oriented performance indicators for the various ACC \nfunctions.12 Necessary support will also be provided to the Cabinet Division as the executing \nagency, particularly in its monitoring and supervision system in relation to its work on this ADTA. \n \n14.  Performance indicators for different functions will include effectiveness and efficiency \nmeasures such as (i) completion rate (percentage of cases completed at a certain point in time), \n(ii) prosecution rate (percentage of cases that resulted in court or disciplinary action), (iii) \nconviction rate (percentage of cases prosecuted that resulted in a court conviction), (iv) cycle \ntime  taken  to  complete  an  investigation  according  to  agreed  milestones,  and  (v)  public \nperception surveys. \n \n15.  The result of this intervention is expected to be the development of a critical mass of \nsenior and middle staff members who can better manage ACC\u2019s functions.  \n \n                                                 \n10The capability plans  will look at the nature of the required knowledge, skills, and abilities, as well as the \ncompetencies to lead an organization involved in a critical function such as battling corruption. The ACC Act \nspecifies that ACC\u2019s mandates and functions are difficult and wide-ranging (e.g., inquire into and investigate \noffenses and alleged corruption, file and conduct cases, carry out research on corruption, promote honesty and \nintegrity). This requires high staff competency at all levels. Competencies of the senior delegated management \nranks  mandated  with  day-to-day  operations  will  need  to  be  aligned  with  their  responsibilities:  (i)  overall \norganizational efficiency through workflow between interrelated departments, (ii) formulation of policies and advice \nto the commissioners, (iii) work in key evaluation and coordination committees, and (iv) deployment of resources. \n11 While the TA proposal cannot at this stage specify which training programs are suitable for senior ACC staff \nmembers, examples of relevant training are (i) the 3-week postgraduate certificate course in corruption studies \noffered by the Hong Kong School of Professional and Continuing Education and run by former personnel from \nHong Kong, China\u2019s Independent Commission Against Corruption; and (ii) courses offered by the Anticorruption \nAcademy of the Malaysian Anticorruption Agency. The ADTA will also consider the possibility of including lessons \nfrom international and regional experiences through visits by specialists from outside Bangladesh. \n12 Without pre-judging the work of the ADTA, the Action Plan will also consider other mechanisms to ensure that the \nhuman resource capability of the ACC is suitably enhanced. This could include, for example, the design of non-\nmonetary rewards that might help the retention of good staff in the ACC. \n ", "4     \n16.  Part B: Strengthening ACC Business Process Systems. Skill enhancement has to be \ncomplemented by business process systems and database development, which will underpin \nperformance management in ACC. The TA will help (i) identify process system and database \ngaps in ACC management; supervise workflow; and use result-oriented performance indicators \nfor professional staff functions that include investigation; intelligence; surveillance; prevention; \nprosecution/legal  activities;13  and  corporate  affairs  encompassing  internal  support  functions \nsuch  as  finance,  human  resource  management,  information  technology  management,  and \npremise management; (ii) analyze the gaps in the process system and database for specific \nfunctions  (systems,  facilities,  and  specialized  equipment  such  as  polygraph  laboratories, \ncomputer forensic equipment, computerized performance indicator systems, and command and \ncontrol room facilities); and (iii) train staff to use such systems and equipment. \n \n17.  The result of this intervention is expected to be improved operational resources and \nsystems at the ACC so that it can better fulfill its functions. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The TA, estimated at $937,000 equivalent, includes a foreign exchange cost of $555,000 \nand $382,000 equivalent in local currency cost. ADB will finance $500,000 on a grant basis from \nthe Japan Special Fund (JSF) funded by the Government of Japan, and $250,000 on a grant \nbasis from the ADB Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF). ADB will, thereby, finance the \nentire foreign exchange cost and $195,000 equivalent of the TA\u2019s local currency cost. The \nGovernment will provide a total of $187,000 equivalent to finance part of the local currency cost \nto cover counterpart staff, office facilities, administrative support, and other expenses such as \nfor in-country facilitation. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  The Cabinet Division, a strong central entity, will serve as the Executing Agency for this \nADTA (as it does for ADTA 4140-BAN). The advantages include its formal role as the official \npoint of communication between the Government and ACC, and its familiarity with the nature of \nthis work through the ongoing TA. \n \n20.  A  project  steering  committee  will  be  chaired  by  the  Cabinet  Secretary,  with \nrepresentatives from ACC, ADB, and, for particular meetings, such other stakeholders (including \ncivil  society  or  private  sector  representatives)  as  may  be  agreed  to  between  the  Cabinet \nDivision and ADB. The steering committee will meet at least once every 6 weeks, and be \nmandated to provide policy oversight and guidance for the two ADTA components.   \n \n21.  Day-to-day project management will be entrusted to a TA Management Unit (TAMU), \nwhich will be based at the Cabinet Division. The Unit will constitute a Project Director (an \nindividual from the Cabinet Division of at least the rank of Deputy Secretary) and supported by \none or two staff members deputed from ACC. The Unit will also be supported by consultants \n                                                 \n13 Investigation represents team-based parallel actions involving search, seizure, arrest, and interrogation to prove or \ndisprove corruption. Intelligence represents vital information obtained for investigation and is of two types: (i) \nstrategic intelligence, formulated on the basis of past trends and patterns; and (ii) tactical intelligence, gathered by \ncultivating agents. Covert surveillance, including physical and electronic, will support intelligence and investigation. \nPrevention will be done through public education, systems review, and research and policy, including annual \nreports and public perception surveys. Finally, prosecution/legal activities entail giving legal advice to ACC and \nprosecute cases in court. \n \n ", "  5\n(national and international) and will be responsible for (i) acting as a secretariat to the steering \ncommittee, including preparing agendas, discussion notes, and raising implementation issues; \n(ii) managing TA reporting and the timetable; and (iii) facilitating TA stakeholder consultations. \n \n22.  ADB  will  engage  a  consulting  firm  and  individual  consultants  to  support  the  unit. \nInternational consultants will be (i) an anticorruption commission organizational development \nexpert (9 person-months), and (ii) an anticorruption commission organizational training needs \nexpert  (9  person-months).  Domestic  consultants  will  be  (i)  two  anticorruption  commission \norganizational  training  and  development  experts  (9  person-months  each),  and  (ii)  an \nanticorruption commission process systems expert (10 person-months). All consultants will be \nselected  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. The simplified \ntechnical proposal and quality-based selection procedures will be used (the latter because of \nthe sensitivity of the specialist technical skill requirements). Outline terms of reference for \nconsultancy services are in Appendix 3. \n \n23.  ADTA equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \nUpon completion of the ADTA, the equipment will be retained by the ACC and the Cabinet \nDivision. The ADTA is planned for 12 months, from April 2006 to April 2007. \n \n24.  The  steering  committee  will  disseminate  the  results  of  the  ADTA  project,  and  the \nevaluation results will be posted on the ADB website. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance on a grant basis to the Government of Bangladesh in an \namount not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 for the purpose of the Supporting Good \nGovernance Initiatives II, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n
