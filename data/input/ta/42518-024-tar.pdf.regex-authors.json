INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Greater Mekong Subregion Economic Cooperation Program Strategic Framework, \n2012\u20132022 stresses the importance of (i) ensuring that all countries in the Greater Mekong \nSubregion  (GMS)  are  connected  to  a  GMS  rail  network  by  2020,  and  (ii)  promoting  the \ndevelopment of a seamless rail network in the GMS as part of a regional cooperation strategy to \nfacilitate  cross-border  infrastructure  development. 1  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nprovided technical assistance (TA) to assess the requirements for regional rail connectivity and \nprepared the Connecting Greater Mekong Subregion Railways: A Strategic Framework, which \nwas  endorsed  at  the  GMS  ministerial  meeting  held  in  Ha  Noi  in  August  2010.2 These \nagreements laid the groundwork for regional rail development, along with the establishment of \nthe Greater Mekong Railway Association (GMRA), whose membership includes all of the GMS \ncountries. \n \n2.  To create a regional rail network, it is necessary to develop the missing rail links. To this \nend, the GMS countries have identified and agreed upon nine priority rail links that, when \ncompleted, will enhance railway connectivity in the GMS.3 The GMRA board approved the nine \nrail links in March 2015.4 These nine links will ensure a complete regional rail network. A list of \nthe nine missing rail links is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n3.  The  TA  is  a  direct  response  to  the  GMS  member  governments\u2019  request  for  ADB \nassistance to review the rail links and provide advice on suitable financial and investment \nopportunities. ADB and the GMS member countries agreed upon the TA through the GMRA as \noutlined in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1).5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Regional connectivity is necessary to support continued economic growth within the \nGMS.  Increasing  trade  and  economic  interaction  among  GMS  countries  requires  transport \nnetworks and systems that can carry significantly higher freight volumes cost-effectively over \nlong distances. As railways are the most efficient mode of transporting large volumes over long \ndistances,  they  are  a  vital  element  of growing  intra-regional  trade. To  this  end,  the  GMS \ncountries are seeking to improve regional railway connectivity to promote cost-efficient, safe, \nand environmentally sustainable transport within and beyond the GMS. \n \n5.  Since  the  2000s,  GMS  member  countries  have  shifted  their  focus  and  transport \ninvestment  plans  from  the  road  sector  to  rail,  which  is  now  receiving  more  attention  and \nincreased financial support. Initially, they focused mostly on upgrading or developing national \nrail systems; but they are now recognizing the need to build on existing national rail plans and \nachieve the benefits of a regional rail system. This increased interest in regional rail is reflected \nin the governments\u2019 commitment to the missing links and the number of studies undertaken on \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2011.

Connecting Greater Mekong Subregion Railways: A Strategic Framework. \nManila. \n3  The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic\u2013Myanmar rail connection was deemed low priority as the expected \ndemand between these two countries is limited and falls below the required demand levels for rail connections in \nthe short to medium term. \n4  The GMRA agreed on the nine rail links at the first general meeting of the GMRA on 12 March 2015 in Kunming, \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China. \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 March 2016. \n ", "2 \nthem. A list of the studies on the missing links is provided in Supplementary Appendix B. To \nrealize these links, it is necessary to assess their viability and potential sources of investment or \nsuitable financing modalities further. \n \n6.  The TA will assess each of the nine rail links, building on previous studies, and will \ndetermine  infrastructure  and  operations  costs,  market  demand  for  passengers  and  freight, \nrevenues, financial and economic viability, social issues, and safeguard requirements. The TA \nwill add to the existing studies on alternate scenarios reflecting the network impacts of regional \nrail development as opposed to stand-alone rail links, and demonstrate the interactive nature of \nnational and regional plans over time. The policy advice provided by the TA will support the \ndevelopment of regional rail connectivity, in addition and parallel to the growth of national rail \nnetworks, to form a complete rail network in the region. \n \nIII.  THE REGIONAL POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact will be greater railway connectivity in the GMS. The outcome will be a \nsuitable investment program prepared for the viable missing rail links.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA has four outputs: (i) updated studies prepared for the nine rail links, (ii) criteria \ndeveloped to assess and prioritize the financing options for the viable rail links, (iii) potential \nfinancing  modalities  identified  for  the  viable  rail  links,  and  (iv)  network  impact  scenarios \nconceived for alternate regional rail development. \n \n9.  Updated studies will be carried out for each of the nine missing regional rail links to \nprovide  GMS  governments  with  suitable  information  on  which  to  base  future  investment \ndecisions. The studies will supplement and build on existing available data and studies, and \naugment the data when required to ensure that enough quality data in key evaluation areas are \navailable to determine the financial and economic viability of each link. Indicative social and \nsafeguard  requirements  will  also  be  assessed  to  allow  a  greater  understanding  of  the \ncomplexity of project development and implementation. The project will also assess financial \nviability markers, including (i) capital costs for rail improvements or new construction, and (ii) \nrolling stock requirements and operational costs. This data will be compared with the potential \nrevenue forecasts for freight and passenger services, and the findings used to examine the \nscale of capital investment required and potential sources of revenue, financial, or budgetary \nsupport, as well as any financial shortfalls and potential subsidies. \n \n10.  The regional network assessment will assess individual links as part of a wider rail \nsystem as opposed to stand-alone rail lines and thus provide a regional dimension to existing \nwork on individual lines. In addition, economic viability studies will broaden the evaluation \nbeyond traditional transport economics to include areas where rail has a competitive advantage \nover other modes of transport, including (i) long-distance regional network development; (ii) \ntravel time and time reliability; (iii) externalities such as environmental impacts, land take, safety, \nand avoided investment in competing modes; (iv) avoided maintenance and operating costs of \nalternative modes; and (v) congestion on competing modes. The congestion and operating \ncosts of other modes is a major area for consideration that has received little attention in other \nstudies. Heavy investment in roads since the 1990s, coupled with a rapid growth in traffic \nvolumes, especially that of trucks, has led to severe road congestion. Consequently, many \n ", "  3 \ngovernments have realized that continued investment in roads is not a viable option as future \nfreight demands will exceed the capacity of a road network. The realization that rail must be \npromoted as part of a multimodal transport network has prompted the GMS countries to change \ntheir subsector focus. More innovative rail assessment criteria is needed to justify what is \nbecoming  increasingly  known  by  decision  makers  but  lacks  supporting  evidence  due  to \nlimitations in the evaluation of existing studies. The TA will use the existing studies and broader \nevaluation criteria provided above to update the missing rail link assessments and provide more \nrelevant information to make better informed decisions as to how best to move the project \nforward for potential financing, relevant to the potential benefits of the rail links.  \n \n11.  The TA will also assess key social and environmental aspects, such as route alignments \nthrough sensitive areas, emissions for climate change impacts, rail subsector growth, and job \ncreation and livelihood impacts on other subsectors. The findings of these studies, including \nthose relating to financial and economic viability, as well as key social and environmental \nconsiderations,  will  be  presented  through  workshops  to  GMS  member  countries  and  rail \noperators. \n \n12.  Based  on  these  studies,  the  GMS  member  countries  and  their  respective  rail \norganizations will agree on values at which the financial and/or economic viability of the nine rail \nlinks  will  be  deemed  suitable  for  further  consideration  and  the  preparation  of  appropriate \nfinancing modalities. Key social and environmental aspects will also be used to refine the \nevaluation criteria and prioritization of the nine links. Findings relating to the prioritization of the \nviable links will be presented through workshops to GMS rail authorities and operators. \n \n13.  The rail links that meet the selected financial and/or economic evaluation levels will be \nassessed in more detail to prepare suitable financing modalities for project investment and \nimplementation options. An overall regional rail development program with time-bound horizons \nwill be prepared to identify when certain links will be viable for investment. The development of \nan integrated regional rail system over time will be linked to each link\u2019s viability. Potential \nfinancing modalities will consider all available options such as national budgets, donor support, \nand private sector participation. While capital expenditure on rail is relatively large, the benefits \nover time, especially when the assessment includes externalities, can provide an attractive and \ncompetitive option for regional transport. This is especially true for growing economies with \nsubstantial increases in intra-regional trade, such as the GMS. Potential financing modalities will \nbe presented through workshops to GMS countries and rail operators, and to potential private \nsector investors where suitable.  \n \n14.  One of the key advantages of a regional rail network is that it can allow investment in \none link to generate greater returns through its connections to other links, whether national or \ninternational. Alternative regional rail development scenarios will be prepared in 10-year time-\nbound  horizons, from  2020  to  2050. The  analysis  findings  will  guide  the  preparation  of  a \nregional rail development program proposal for the GMS, which will include horizon years for \nthe opening of the missing rail links. The findings will be presented through workshops to the \nGMRA, GMS countries, rail operators, and potential investors, including ADB. \n \n15.  The  TA  risks  are  (i)  reduced  interest  in  regional  connectivity  by  GMS  member \ngovernments, and (ii) the deterioration of relationships and a lack of international consensus on \nthe approach to be taken. \n \n ", "4 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  Regional  Cooperation  and  Poverty  Reduction  Fund  and \nadministered by ADB. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA, with the Transport and Communications \nDivision of the Southeast Asia Department as the focal point. ADB will coordinate closely with \nthe GMS member governments, national rail bodies, and the GMRA board on all aspects of \nimplementation. The GMRA\u2019s  working group  on  network  connectivity  will  serve  as  the  TA \nsteering committee to ensure a close relationship with national plans and priorities. The TA will \nbe implemented from 1 July 2016 to 30 September 2017. \n \n18.  Implementation will require 22 person-months of individual consultants in the core team, \n(one international railway specialist for 10 person-months and one national senior regional \nproject coordination specialist for 12 person-months). The railway specialist will provide the \nnecessary specific rail expertise for cross-national boundary rail operations, while the senior \nregional project coordination specialist will ensure smooth working relationships between the \nnational rail bodies, national study teams, international specialists, GMRA, and ADB. In addition \nto the individual consultants, teams of consultants will be recruited to assess each of the nine \nmissing rail links. The teams will comprise international and/or national consultants and, where \npossible, will be considered for one or more of the studies. The teams will be recruited as firms. \nThe level of inputs required for the study teams will vary according to data availability and \nexisting studies; it is estimated that around 30 person-months of consultants will be engaged for \nthe  studies. Output-based  contracts  will  be  used for study team  consulting  services  when \npossible. Consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The terms of reference for consultants are in \nAppendix  3.  Disbursements  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n19.  ADB will manage the TA, with stakeholder oversight provided through the national rail \norganizations, relevant line agencies, and the GMRA. The TA findings will be disseminated to \neach GMS country through seminars and workshops, as well as to the GMRA Working Group \nmeetings and general meeting. Financing and investment opportunities will be shared with \npotential donors and investment partners through a special GMRA seminar on regional rail \nfinancing. A dedicated GMRA website will be pursued to disseminate the TA findings more \nbroadly. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction \nFund for Connecting the Railways of the Greater Mekong Subregion, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact the TA is aligned with \n \nGreater railway connectivity in the GMS (Greater Mekong Subregion Economic Cooperation Program \nStrategic Framework, 2012\u20132022)a \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome       \nSuitable investment  By 2018, investment  GMRA board general  Reduced interest in \nprogram prepared for  options for the viable  meeting summary report  regional connectivity \nthe viable missing rail  missing rail links adopted  and/or minutes   \nlinks  by the GMRA board \nOutputs       \n1.

Technical Assistance Scope, Outputs, and Activities \n \n21.  The technical assistance (TA) aims to support increased railway connectivity in the GMS. \nThe TA consists of four outputs, each with several activities: (i) pre-feasibility studies for the \nmissing rail links with limited data and a more detailed assessment for the agreed nine missing \nlinks  where  available,  (ii)  criteria to  assess  and  prioritize  the  viable  missing rail  links,  (iii) \npotential financing modalities for the viable missing rail links, and (iv) network impact scenarios \nfor alternative regional rail development. The activities to be undertaken to complete each of \nthese outputs are outlined below. The international railway specialist will be responsible for \ndelivering the four TA outputs and for carrying out the activities described in paras. 5\u20138 and the \nspecific tasks listed in para. 10. When required, he or she will be supported in the preparation of \nthe studies by national teams, whose inputs he or she will define once the existing studies and \navailable data have been initially reviewed. The senior regional project coordination specialist \nwill  help  ADB  and  the  international  railway  specialist  ensure  the  delivery  of  the  TA  by \n(i) facilitating seamless coordination with ADB, the GMRA, GMS countries and rail operators, \nand national study teams; and (ii) preparing and delivering various workshops to discuss the TA \nfindings.  \n \n22.  Reports will be prepared for each of the agreed nine missing rail links to be studied, \nusing a pre-feasibility level of detail at minimum, and incorporating more details and assessment \nwhere available. The studies will be based on existing studies and data and augmented with \nadditional data where required. Each of the nine missing rail links will be evaluated for economic \nand financial viability as well as to highlight key social and environmental considerations. The \nfindings of the studies will be presented through workshops to the GMS countries and rail \noperators. \n \n23.  Criteria to assess and prioritize the viable missing rail links from among the agreed nine \npriority links will be prepared for discussion and agreement with the GMRA, GMS countries, and \nrail operators. Each of the nine missing rail links will be evaluated against the agreed evaluation \ncriteria, and potential time-bound implementation horizons will be prepared. The findings of the \nprioritization of the viable missing rail links will be presented through workshops to the GMS \ncountries and rail operators. \n \n24.  Potential  financing  modalities  for  the  viable  missing  rail  links  will  be  prepared  and \npresented through workshops to the GMS countries and rail operators. Based on the preferred \nfinancing  modalities,  financing  and  implementation  options  will  be  prepared  for  the  viable \nmissing rail links and presented through workshops to the relevant countries and rail operators. \n \n25.  Network impact scenarios for alternate regional rail development will be prepared in 10-\nyear time-bound horizons, from 2020 to 2050. The scenarios will use indicative trade volume \nflows and alternate trade route transportation costs to prepare alternate regional rail network \ndevelopment scenarios linked to  the potential opening dates of the missing rail links. The \nanalysis findings will guide the preparation of a proposal for a regional rail development program \nfor  the  GMS,  including  the  potential  opening  years  of  the  missing  rail  links  based  on  an \nassessment of when they will become viable due to demand growth on specific corridors. The \nfindings will be presented through workshops to the GMRA, GMS countries, and rail operators.  \n \n ", "Appendix 3  9 \nB.  Terms of Reference for Specialists  \n \n26.
