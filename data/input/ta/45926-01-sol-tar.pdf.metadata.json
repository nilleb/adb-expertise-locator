INTRODUCTION \n1.  The telecoms market in the Pacific is dominated by high tariffs, low access rates, and \nlow participation by the private sector. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been involved \nin several recent projects to address these issues. In 2009, ADB provided a corporate loan to \nDigicel to support the expansion of its mobile telecoms network in Papua New Guinea.1 In 2011, \nADB extended a $40 million project loan and made an $8 million equity investment to support \nthe Bemobile Expansion Project in both Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands.2 Together, \nthese projects will increase the penetration of high-quality, affordable mobile telecom services in \nboth countries. \n \n2.  Network  expansion  in  Solomon  Islands  is  challenging  owing  to  the  geographic \ndispersion of the population, difficult geography, and lack of existing power sector infrastructure. \nTo maximize the success of the Bemobile Expansion Project and to ensure that new network \nassets are deployed in an efficient, sustainable, and socially responsible manner, Bemobile has \nrequested technical assistance (TA) to pilot test renewable energy technologies in support of \nmobile base stations in Solomon Islands. The TA will support Bemobile to demonstrate the \nextent to which renewable technologies can reduce reliance on costly diesel power generation, \nand it will pilot community power business models and investigate other methods for increasing \nthe social inclusiveness of the Bemobile Expansion Project. Lessons learned will be shared with \nother market participants, and technical findings and resource assessments will be used to \nscale up the use of renewable energy technologies by telecoms operators throughout Solomon \nIslands. The TA will provide a template for replication across the Pacific. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Solomon Islands is one of the poorest countries in the region, with annual per capita \nincome of $1,256 in 2009.3 The population is highly fragmented and communities are confined \nto islands distanced by sea and difficult terrain. Some 80% of the population lives in small and \ndispersed  settlements,  many  of  which  are  remote.  Communication  is  challenging  and \ncontributes to low employment, few income-generating opportunities, and poor access to basic \nservices. \n \n4.  The  telecoms  market  in  Solomon  Islands  is  characterized  by  high  tariffs  and  low \npenetration rates and was negatively impacted in 2000 when many facilities were destroyed \nduring civil unrest. Consequently, Solomon Islands is one of the least \u2015connected\u2016 countries in \nthe world. Most areas have no access to communications infrastructure\u2014in 2008, the fixed line \npenetration rate was 1.6% while mobile penetration was 6.0%.4 Tariffs are high relative to \nregional comparators and per capita incomes. Although the cost of local mobile calls has fallen, \nit  is  still  over  $0.20  per  minute.  Voice-over-internet-protocol  calls  are  very  expensive  and \nbroadband access is limited to the capital, Honiara. \n \n5.  Steps have been taken to improve penetration rates and tariff levels. Since 2008, the \ngovernment  has  begun  to  introduce  competition  and  transfer  regulatory  functions  to  an \nindependent body. The monopoly status of Our Telekom was renegotiated and a new operator, \n                                                \n1 ADB. 2009.

Although subscriber \ngrowth increased markedly from 5,000 in August 2010 to about 60,000 in December 2010, \nsignificant investment in network expansion is required to increase penetration rates and reduce \ntariff levels. \n \n6.  ADB is helping to address these issues with the Bemobile Expansion Project. Through a \n$40 million loan and a $9 million equity investment, ADB is supporting Bemobile to increase the \npenetration of high-quality, affordable mobile telecom services in Solomon Islands. The project \nwill expand the Bemobile network and improve the accessibility and quality of telecom service, \nparticularly in remote and low-income areas. The improved network will enable better access to \ninformation, including for public service delivery, education, health, and security. Increased \naffordability and accessibility will enable inclusive economic growth by facilitating access to \nmarkets and developing other businesses relying on telecoms services. The project will support \nthe government strategy of encouraging private sector participation, which is critical given the \nlevel of investment required and limited self-financing capacity. \n \n7.  Despite these efforts, barriers to the efficiency and sustainability of network expansion \nremain. In particular, the availability of grid power in Solomon Islands is extremely limited. Less \nthan 20% of all households have access to electricity and about 80% of all electricity is supplied \nto Honiara. Most mobile base station equipment is supplied by on-site diesel generators. These \nare costly to run and involve complex logistical arrangements to ensure sufficient diesel is on \nhand. Reliance on diesel emits carbon dioxide and causes local environmental pollution, and \nthe provision of power to mobile base stations currently accounts for more than half of all \nnetwork operation costs. \n \n8.  Renewable and remote monitoring technologies offer the opportunity to reduce the cost \nof  operating  mobile  networks,  and  improve  the  environmental  sustainability  and  quality  of \ntelecoms services in remote locations. Although renewable technologies can be commercially \nviable, few pilot projects exist in the Pacific and diesel power remains the baseline technology.5 \nWidespread  deployment  in  Solomon  Islands  requires  assistance  in  the  form  of  resource \nassessment, technology selection, training, and capacity building. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n9.  The TA will support mobile operators in Solomon Islands to increase the penetration of \nhigh-quality,  affordable  mobile  telecom  services  in  an  efficient,  sustainable,  and  socially \nresponsible manner. The TA will (i) carry out a solar and wind resource assessment for mobile \nbase stations; (ii) pilot test solar, wind, and remote monitoring technologies in at least two base \nstations;  (iii)  provide  training  in  operation  and  maintenance  and  best  practice  engineering \n(e.g., limited land clearance, slope protection, erosion control) in relation to these renewable \nenergy technologies; (iv) pilot test community power models and identify follow-on schemes to \nincrease community access to power; and (v) prepare specifications for scaling up the number \nof mobile base stations powered by solar and wind technologies. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the TA will be the increased penetration in Solomon Islands of high-\nquality, affordable mobile telecom services provided in an efficient, sustainable, and socially \nresponsible manner. Performance targets and indicators include (i) an increase in the mobile \n                                                \n5 GSM Association. 2009. Green Power for Mobile Programme Digicel Vanuatu. London. \n ", "  3 \npenetration rate in Solomon Islands from 6% in 2008 to 35% by 2015; and (ii) a 50% reduction \nin fuel costs for mobile base stations by 2015 from the 2010 baseline of $1.5 million. The \noutcome of the TA will be that mobile operators reduce reliance on diesel for power generation \nat mobile base station locations. Performance targets and indicators include  the following: \n(i) pilot projects reduce diesel consumption by 44,000 liters and carbon dioxide emissions by \n96 tons per year by 2013; and (ii) follow-on projects identified that reduce diesel consumption by \n1.5 million liters and carbon emissions by 3,400 tons per year at 70 base stations by 2013. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will be structured around five outputs as follows: (i) a solar and wind resource \nassessment for mobile base stations is undertaken; (ii) solar, wind, and remote monitoring \ntechnologies  are  pilot  tested;  (iii)  training  in  operation  and maintenance  and  best  practice \nengineering in relation to these renewable energy technologies is provided; (iv) community \npower models are pilot tested and follow-on schemes to increase community access to power \nare identified; and (v) technical specifications for future base stations to be powered by solar \nand wind technologies are prepared. \n \n12.  Risks to the success of the TA include (i) regulatory uncertainty as a result of ongoing \nlegislative change; (ii) delay or cancellation of planned network expansion activities of mobile \noperators in Solomon Islands; and (iii) deterioration of the business environment. These risks \nare addressed through ADB\u2019s deep involvement in the telecoms sector in Solomon Islands \nthrough the  Bemobile Expansion  Project  and thorough  consultation  during TA  preparation. \nProcurement risks will be mitigated by outsourcing this activity to the TA consulting firm and by \nsound application of ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). \nSocial and environmental concerns will be addressed by ensuring TA compliance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  safeguard  provisions  in  the  Bemobile  Expansion \nProject. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $450,000 equivalent, which will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). Bemobile will provide in-\nkind contributions to finance the cost of counterpart staff, office accommodation, communication, \nand local transport. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The TA will be implemented over an 18-month period commencing 1 January 2012 and \nending 30 June 2013. Bemobile, the only private sector mobile operator in Solomon Islands, will \nserve as the executing agency and will be responsible for in-country execution of the TA. ADB, \nthrough the user division, Private Sector Infrastructure Finance Division 2, will be responsible for \nrecruitment  of  consulting  services,  negotiating  the  consulting  contract,  and  supervising \n(including  billing  and  payment)  the  consulting  services  during  implementation.  A  letter \nagreement  has  been  implemented  with  the  executing  agency  setting  out  the  terms  and \nconditions of the TA. The Private Sector Infrastructure Finance Division 2 and the executing \nagency will each assign a project officer who will be responsible for (i) timely communication \nand actions between the consulting firm, the executing agency, and ADB; (ii) monitoring and \nwhen appropriate providing guidance to the consulting firm; (iii) attending scheduled review \nmeetings at the start, middle, and end of the TA; and (iv) reviewing, commenting on, and \napproving the inception and final reports. \n ", "4   \n \n15.  The TA will require an estimated 10.5 person-months of international consulting services \nand 5.5 person-months of national consulting services. The terms of reference are outlined in \nAppendix 3. Consulting services will be provided through a firm and will be recruited using the \nquality- and cost-based selection method at a ratio of 90:10. The firm will be engaged in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime) and will be selected using the simplified technical proposal method. \n \n16.  The consulting firm will be responsible for the procurement of equipment for the pilot \nprojects and will undertake this activity in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. \nInstallation and commissioning will be carried out by the equipment supplier; the TA consulting \nfirm will supervise these activities and test the equipment to ensure its satisfactory operation. \nUpon  completion,  ownership  of  equipment  will  pass  to  the  executing  agency  and  a \nmemorandum of understanding covering its operation will be agreed. The proceeds of the TA \nwill be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time). Outputs of the TA will be disseminated through using \nknowledge products and in-country workshops. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n17.
