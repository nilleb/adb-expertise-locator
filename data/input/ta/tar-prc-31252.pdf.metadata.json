During  the  2002  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) confirmed its request for technical assistance (TA) from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to assist the State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC) to \ndevelop its power pricing strategy with a focus on tariff setting and regulation.1 In March 2003, \nthe Fact-Finding Mission was fielded to determine the scope of the TA and assess available \nstudies. The Mission held discussions with representatives from the PRC Government and \nSERC.  An  understanding  was  reached  on  the  TA  goals,  purpose,  scope,  cost  estimates, \nfinancing and implementation arrangements, and the consultants\u2019 terms of reference. The TA \nframework is given in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Achieving the right balance between the benefits of market pricing for electricity and \nother social goals is one of the critical issues faced by developing countries. Electricity pricing \ncan be used to influence demand and contribute to rational electricity use, increased economic \nefficiency, and greater prosperity. For this, the Government needs to cooperate in the newly \nrestructured power sector with the various stakeholders, such as electricity providers, electricity \nconsumers, and the regulator, to establish a fair and cost-reflective tariff system for electricity \nservices that also reduces nontechnical losses. \n \n3.  Electricity tariffs in the PRC are regulated by the Government. The electricity tariffs are \nset at provincial level and usually comprise (i) catalog tariffs2 applied to recover (a) costs of \nstate grants for all plants and transmission and distribution built before 1985; (b) loans from the \nGovernment for many of the plants and transmission and distribution built after 1985; and \n(c) costs  of  power  plants  financed  by  joint  investment  from  central,  provincial,  and  local \ngovernments; plants of independent power producers; and plants owned by local governments \nor industries that sell surplus power to the grid; and (ii) state and local surcharges added to \nconsumer tariffs across a province.3  \n \n4.  The  end-consumer  tariff  structure  of  the  PRC  in  general  comprises  six  consumer \ncategories:  (i)  residential,  (ii)  nonresidential  lighting,  (iii)  commercial,  (iv)  nonindustry  and \ngeneral industry,4 (v) large industry, and (vi) agriculture. A one-time connection fee is applied to \nnew consumers connected to the network, which is determined on the basis of the need to \ncover investments at the subtransmission and distribution level. In addition,  a two-part tariff, \nconsisting of capacity and energy charges, is applied only to large industrial consumers. There is \nno capacity charge for all other consumers. \n \n5.  Between 1990 and 2000, the real end-consumer tariffs in the PRC increased on average \nby about 7% annually. Based on the estimated long-run marginal cost (LRMC)5 of electricity \nsupply and the load characteristics of several provincial power grids in the PRC, on average the \ncurrent tariff level is about 90\u201395% of the LRMC of supply for different regions.6 While industrial \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) in January 2003. \n2  By 2001, most of provinces in the PRC applied uniform end-user tariffs at provincial level. \n3  The comprehensive price difference was abolished in the second half of 2000. At present, the uniform tariffs \ninclude surcharges covering the Electricity Construction Fund, the three Gorges Project Construction Fund, and the \nCity Public Utility Fund. The surcharges are estimated to be 6\u201310% of electricity bills in 2001. \n4  This includes large nonindustrial consumers such as airports and ports. \n5  The concept of marginal cost pricing is useful in attempting to optimize the allocation of resources. However, the \nhigher tariffs that may result from the application of this principle could be detrimental to a country's industrial \ncompetitiveness or might deprive lower income consumers of an essential service. In any case, marginal cost \nvaluation provides valuable guidance and benchmarking in establishing efficient tariff structure and level, even if \nthe level of marginal costs is not totally recovered in the average tariff. \n6  The end-consumer tariffs, however, include government levies that do not accrue to the utility. ", "2 \n \nconsumers are paying tariffs at or higher than the estimated economic costs, residential, \ncommercial, and agricultural users are paying tariffs below their economic costs. Residential \nand  agricultural  consumers  are  the  main  recipients  of  subsidies.  With  the  adjustment  of \nindustrial structure and the rapid increase in people\u2019s living standards, the gap between peak \nand off-peak demand has been expanding. At present, time-of-day tariffs are applied to some \nconsumer categories. The current time-of-day tariffs do not provide much flexibility or adequate \nincentive for customers to shift their electricity consumption away from peak hours. \n \n6.  The present tariff structure is relatively complex and inequitable, does not fully reflect \nthe  structure  of  supply  costs,  and  does  not  provide  adequate  incentives  for  electricity \nconservation.  Within  the  same  consumer  category,  consumption  at  lower  voltage  level  is \ncharged at higher tariff, but the difference is small compared with the difference in supply costs. \nThe  pattern  of  cross-subsidies  suggests  that  the  industry  sector  subsidizes  electricity \nconsumption in the agriculture and residential sectors. All consumer categories are paying \nsubstantially higher than the LRMC of supply for electricity in the off-peak period, but lower than \nthe supply costs in the peaking period. The current pricing system, which involves substantial \ncross-subsidies, is not conducive to the efficient use of electricity. \n \n7.  As a part of general economic reforms, the PRC has undertaken tariff reforms in recent \nyears. These include (i) unifying consumer tariffs for each consumer category under each \nprovincial-level power system; (ii) rationalizing the classification of consumer categories and \nmaking adequate increases in the tariff differential for power supplies at adjacent voltage levels \nto reflect supply costs; and (iii) improving the two-part tariff system, consisting of capacity and \nenergy charges, by increasing the capacity charge to industrial consumers. These reforms have \nresulted in a much better tariff level and structure and contributed to substantial efficiency \nimprovement in the PRC\u2019s power sector. \n \n8.  In December 2002, a major step in restructuring the PRC power sector was taken by \nestablishing five power generation companies and two grid companies to separate generation \nfrom  transmission  and  distribution.7  Tariff  reforms  in  the  PRC,  such  as  separation  of \ntransmission and distribution tariffs from the end consumer tariffs, are urgently needed to \nsupport the ongoing power sector reforms. In addition,  the  issues  of  the  stranded power \npurchase agreements (PPA), emission charge for coal, and social equity need to be analyzed \nand incorporated into the tariff design and regulation. The current policies for setting electricity \ntariffs need to be reformed to be compatible with power market design and to increase energy \nefficiency, promote environment protection, and ensure sustainable development of the power \nsector. \n \n9.  The  immediate  tariff  reform  objectives  are  to  design  a  system  with  well-designed \ntransmission, distribution, and retail tariffs that are comparable with the power sector reforms. In \nthis system, the generation tariffs will be determined through competition, while the Government \nwill continue to regulate the transmission and distribution tariffs. This requires a transparent tariff \nregulation framework to ensure successful implementation. The consumer category will be \nreclassified and the retail tariff structure will be optimized. The longer-term tariff reform objective \nis  that  the  tariff  setting  should  be  based  on  principles  of  economic  cost  of  supply  while \naddressing other social concerns.  The affordability of tariffs for poor consumers in rural and \nurban areas will also be taken into account. \n                                                 \n7  ADB is supporting the restructuring of the power sector under TA 2917 (ADB. 1997.  Technical Assistance to \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for Power Sector Restructuring. Manila). This TA proposed to the Government a well-\nstructured approach for deregulating the power  sector. In addition, under the TA 3931 (ADB. 2002.  Technical \nAssistance to People\u2019s Republic of China for Establishing the National Electricity Regulatory Commission. Manila), \nthe consultants will assist SERC in  promoting competition, encouraging new investment, and ensuring that \ncustomers receive a fair share of the efficiency gain. \n ", "    3 \n \n10.  Traditionally, electricity subsidies between customer categories (cross-subsidies) have \nbeen used in the PRC, without taking into consideration the consumers\u2019 ability to pay or their \nlevels of consumption.  In the context of the ongoing power market development, a carefully \nthought-out strategy is needed for phasing out the cross-subsidies and developing appropriate \ndelivery mechanisms for direct subsidies from the Government to low-income groups. For this, \nthe option of lifeline tariff may need to be explored.8 \n \n11.  Lack of electricity supply to meet basic needs could create negative impacts on health, \neducation, and economic development. Also, rural tariffs are generally higher than urban tariffs. \nThe Government is aiming to provide a basic supply of grid-connected electricity to all rural \nconsumers at an  affordable tariff through a rural electrification campaign started in 1998. The \ncosts of rural electrification are partially borne by the Government through dedicated funding. The \nGovernment also instructed the provincial electricity companies to reduce rural tariffs and bring \nthem in line with the tariff levels for urban consumers. This will lead to an implicit subsidy because \nthe cost of supplying electricity to rural areas is higher than the urban areas. However, the \nGovernment considers that such temporary subsidy is justified, as its objective is to ensure that \nthe rural population, in particular the poor, have access to affordable electricity. \n \n12.  The financial impact of tariff adjustments on power utilities is an important concern of the \ntariff reforms. In a more competitive market environment, power utilities\u2019 financial performance \nwill need to be improved to ensure the success of power market reforms and a sustainable \npower development.9 Furthermore, the proposed tariff reforms should involve well-targeted and \ntemporary subsidies to reflect social concerns. The proposed tariff reforms should benefit those \nwho really need them and enhance the accessibility, availability, and acceptability of electricity \nservices, particularly in the rural areas. The subsidies involved should be visible in terms of their \nsize, transparent in terms of their sources and beneficiaries, and subject to reduction within a \nprescribed time period. The tariff reform is an opportunity to create an environment enabling \nprivate sector participation in the power sector development. \n \n13.  SERC, which will directly report to the State Council, was established in early 2003. Its \nmain functions include implementing the power sector restructuring and enforcing law and \nregulations in the power sector. The functions of SERC in the area of electricity tariffs are to \n(i) propose tariff settings and adjustments to the government pricing authority according to \nmarket  conditions  and  based  on  the  general  tariff  guidelines  issued  by  the  Government, \n(ii) review and improve tariff structure and levels, and (iii) determine and regulate fees and \ncharges for ancillary services. To perform its functions, SERC urgently needs to develop tariff \nsetting methodologies and regulatory guidelines, in accordance with the Electricity Law and the \ntariff guidelines issued by the State Development and Reform Commission. The reform plan will \ninclude a detailed implementation schedule and an assessment of the impact of the proposed \ntariff reforms on consumers. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n14.  The objective of the TA is to help SERC develop a power pricing strategy a reform action \nplan focusing on tariff setting and tariff regulation. \n                                                 \n8  The determination of the desirable level of a lifeline tariff will take into account the electricity consumption patterns \nand the percentage of disposable income that poor households use for purchase of electricity in terms of \npurchasing power parity. \n9  Impact assessments in some provinces indicate that, even with the proposed decrease in rural tariffs, power \nutilities\u2019 financial performance will improve due to the result of efficiency gains in the transmission and distribution \nof electricity brought about by the improved rural electrification system and the more efficient tariff structure after \ntariff reforms. ", "4 \n \n15.  The TA will  (i) examine key issues related to power tariff setting, tariff regulation, \ngeneration tariff under competitive power market, transmission and distribution tariffs, social \nimpact,  environmental  improvement,  and  regulation;  and  develop  a  strategy  and  an \nimplementation plan to address these issues; (ii) optimize available power capacity through \nproper tariff setting and regulation; (iii) assess impacts of power tariff reforms on consumers\u2019 \naffordability, power utilities\u2019 financial viability, and environmental protection; (iv) identify and \nremove barriers to tariff reforms, and develop the necessary policy and regulatory framework; \n(v) analyze the issue of subsidies and cross-subsidies; and (vi) conduct a consultation workshop \nwith main stakeholders. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n16.  The TA will be carried out in three phases. During phase I, the consultants will undertake \ninitial data gathering and preliminary analysis. The consultants will identify the main issues to be \naddressed to achieve the TA objectives, and the  reform measures required to address these \nissues. Under phase II, the consultants will analyze in detail the issues relating to tariff setting and \ntariff regulation. In phase III, the consultants will make impact assessments from technical, \ninstitutional, economic, social, financial, pricing,  environmental, and poverty impact viewpoints, \nand will formulate an appropriate tariff development strategy and present an action plan. The \nrecommendations of the consultants will be discussed in a workshop with the main stakeholders. \nThe consultants will organize a final workshop with the main stakeholders to disseminate the TA \nfindings and recommendations.  The outline terms of reference for consultants are given in \nAppendix 2. \n \n17.  The TA will include an international seminar on tariff setting and tariff regulation. The \nconsultants will help organize this seminar. International and domestic experts will be invited to \npresent papers and participate in the discussions. After the seminar, the consultants will prepare \na report summarizing the discussions and identifying issues relevant in the PRC context. The \nTA includes an international field study to provide exposure to selected PRC personnel on the \nlatest trends and international best practices in tariff setting and tariff regulation. Personnel from \nSERC and other governmental agencies involved in the policymaking and implementation of tariff \nsetting and tariff regulation will undertake the 2 week study. The consultants will consider the \nparticular needs of the study participants and prepare a study proposal for ADB approval, \nspecifying the (i) objectives of the field study, (ii) institutions to be visited, (iii) agenda for \ndiscussions and training, (iv) name and job description of each member nominated to participate \nin the field study, and (v) costs. Selection procedures for the international field study will have to \nbe acceptable to ADB and take into account considerations of economy and efficiency. At the \nend of the field study, the participants will submit to ADB a report summarizing the findings and \nrecommendations. \n \n18.  The  major  assumptions  and  risks  that  need  to  be  considered  for  the  successful \nimplementation of the TA include inadequate counterpart support, lack of adequate and in-time \nprovision of  data, delay in submission of required studies, delay in consultant selection, and \npoor consultant performance. In addition, the Government\u2019s continuing commitment to power \ntariff rationalization and transparent regulation is necessary for the success of the TA. Efforts will \nbe made to ensure that competent consultants will be recruited in time. SERC is committed to \ntariff reforms and agreed to provide adequate counterpart support and data when needed. Close \ncoordination among the consultants, executing and implementing agencies, and ADB will further \nmitigate these risks. ", "    5 \n \nCost and Financing \n \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $700,000 equivalent with a foreign exchange cost of \n$362,000 and a local currency cost of $338,000 equivalent (Appendix 3). ADB will provide \n$500,000 equivalent to finance $322,000 of the foreign exchange cost and $178,000 equivalent \nof the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding \nprogram. SERC will contribute $200,000 equivalent representing about 29% of the TA cost, to \nfinance the remaining foreign exchange cost of $40,000 and local currency cost of $160,000 \nequivalent. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  SERC  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA.  ADB  will  engage  the  services  of \ninternational and domestic consultants according to its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The \ninternational consultants will have expertise in (i) tariff setting, (ii) tariff regulation, (iii) LRMC \ncalculation, (iv) environmental assessment, (v) economic and financial analysis, (vi) corporate \ngovernance and power sector reforms, and (vii) poverty impact and social assessment. The \ndomestic consultants will have similar expertise. An estimated total of 29 person-months of \nconsulting services will be required: 8 for international and 21 for domestic services. \n \n21.  SERC  will  establish  a  counterpart  team  with  representatives  from  SERC  and the \nprovinces  selected  for  pilot  studies.10  The  counterpart  team  will  closely  interact  with  the \nconsultants  during  TA  implementation.11  SERC  will  also  establish  a  steering  committee \ncomprising senior SERC officials and representatives from other government organizations and \nagencies involved in formulating and implementing tariff policies. The steering committee will be \nthe apex body that will convey and interpret the government\u2019s views on policy issues and \ngenerally  oversee  TA  implementation.  The  counterpart  team  members  will  interact  with \nmembers of the steering committee to seek clarification of issues and matters that fall outside \nthe purview of SERC. SERC will provide interpreters, local transportation, and office space \nequipped with suitable office facilities in Beijing. Some of the office equipment will be financed \nunder the TA and will be procured by the international consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nguidelines for procurement. The TA is expected to commence in October 2003 and be completed \nby October 2004. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Power Pricing Strategy: Tariff Setting and \nRegulation, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n10  The pilot provinces will be selected in phase I of the TA. After reviewing the basic information, the consultants, in \nclose consultation with SERC and ADB, will determine the selection criteria and number of provinces, and \nrecommend the pilot provinces for approval by SERC and ADB. \n11  SERC will appoint the counterpart team before the TA negotiations.

The technical assistance (TA) will be carried out by a consulting firm with experience in \ninstitutional,  economic,  financial,  environmental,  and  social  analyses,  impact  assessment, \nelectricity  tariff  design,  and  analysis  of  subsidies  in  the  power  subsector.  The  team  of \ninternational consultants will consist of a tariff specialist, a power economist, a social impact \nanalyst, a financial analyst, and an institutional specialist. The study will require about 8 person-\nmonths  of  international  and  21  person-months of domestic consulting services. To ensure \neffective assistance to the international consultants, the team of domestic consultants will have \nthe same team composition. The consultants will work in close collaboration with the State \nElectric  Regulatory  Commission  (SERC)  and  ensure  effective  know  how  transfer.  The \ninternational  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n \n2.  On commencement of the TA, the consultants will do a detailed background study to \ngain a thorough understanding of the issues related to tariff setting and regulation in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The consultants will review the relevant reports and studies, \nincluding those of SERC and international agencies including ADB, World Bank, and other aid \nagencies. After reviewing the basic information, the consultants  will determine the selection \ncriteria and number of pilot provinces, and recommend the pilot provinces for approval by SERC \nand ADB. The consultants will have discussions with members of the steering committee and \ncounterpart team to obtain a good understanding of the Government's reform directions and \nestablish a sound basis for the TA work. The consultants should evaluate  the international \nexperience  in  related  areas  and  their  relevance  in  the  PRC  context  and  tailor  their \nrecommendations to reflect the situation in the PRC to ensure they are relevant and can be \neffectively implemented. The presentation of recommendations should focus on how to go from \nthe current stage of tariff setting, regulation, and reforms to an efficient stage of tariff setting and \nregulation.  \n \nA.  Terms of Reference \n \n3.  The terms of reference of the consulting services will include, but will not be limited to \nthe following. \n \n1.  Phase I: Preliminary Analysis \n \n4.  During phase I, the consultants will do the following \n \n(i)  Trace the history of tariff setting and tariff reforms in the PRC, and discuss the \nsignificant changes and their impact. Review the country's methodology for tariff \nsetting and collect data on tariff level and structure. \n \n(ii)  Present a clear picture of the situation with regard to electricity tariffs in the PRC, \nincluding  (a)  the  current  electricity  tariff  structure  and  level  and  in  different \nregions; (b) the basis of the tariff setting and tariff approval procedures; (c) the \nrelationships among the institutions involved; (d) the roles and responsibilities of \ncentral and provincial governments in tariff determination; (e) subsidies and \ncross-subsidies;  (f)  the  financial  position  and  financial  governance  of  power \nutilities;  (g) affordability  by  consumers;  (h)  the  objectives  of  electricity tariff \nreform, including the overall objective and  the objective in each development \nstage; and (i) past reform measures including those for generation, transmission, \ndistribution, and retail tariffs in each development stage. \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \n \n  (iii)  Organize and conduct a household survey to identify the stakeholders of the \nproposed tariff reforms, the willingness and ability of consumers to pay, and level \nof surcharges and fees at local level. The survey will provide a base for the impact \nassessment. \n \n(iv)  Identify the main issues of the present electricity tariffs, including the tariff setting \nmechanism, tariff regulation, efficiency of current  tariff structure/level, and the \nmain obstacles to power tariff reforms. Include the linkages of electricity tariffs to \neconomic growth, social impact, and environmental improvement. \n \n(v)  Review generation tariffs and issues of generation power plants with signed \npower purchase agreements (PPA). Investigate and analyze the current situation \nof the foreign-owned generation plants with signed PPAs. These should include \ninvestment modes, funding resources, power station types, installed capacity, \ncontracted  electricity  generation,  actual  electricity  generation,  contracted \ngeneration tariffs and actual average generation tariffs in the last 5 years. \n \n(vi)  Identify issues of direct access to the market for large consumers. Review and \npresent international experience in this area, including the main objectives, basic \nconditions, identification of the large consumers, and the arrangements for the \ndirect access.  \n \n(vii)   Analyze conditions for the direct access of large consumers in the power market. \nInclude the modes of the electricity market, the treatment  of \u201cstranded cost,\u201d \ntransmission and distribution tariffs, ancillary service charges, and  retail tariff \nadd-ons. Analyze the impacts of large consumer\u2019s direct access on generators, \nfranchise consumers and power grid companies.  \n \n(viii)  Identify  the  barriers  to  tariff  reforms  and  measures  to  remove  the  barriers, \nincluding institutional, ownership, social, and financial constraints. \n \n(ix)  Describe the tariff reform initiatives proposed by the Government to support \nseparation of generation and transmission and distribution, including objectives \nand the means proposed to achieve these objectives. Assess if these reform \nmeasures would be adequate to address the constraints for the power market \ndevelopment and economic growth. \n \n(x)  Calculate the long-run marginal costs (LRMCs) and compare existing tariffs with \nthe LRMC. Based on the LRMC, revenue requirements of typical power utilities, \nand the existing tariff structure, estimate and analyze existing and projected \ncross-subsidies,  in  both  economic  and  financial  terms,  between  consumer \ncategories and regions, taking into account the projected growth in demand and \npower system expansion. \n \n2.  Phase II: Tariff Settings and Regulatory Function \n \n5.  During second phase, the consultants will do the following \n \n(i)  Develop pricing mechanisms for the bilateral contract market, spot market, real \ntime  market,  and  ancillary  service  market  based  on  international  practices. \nIntroduce international experience on the judgment and regulation of the power \nmarket. ", "10   Appendix 2 \n \n(ii)  Introduce international experience and discuss its relevance in the PRC context \nto tariff forecast methodology under the competitive power market and treatment \nof the stranded cost. Develop the generation tariff structure and its adaptability to \ndifferent electricity market modes in the PRC. \n \n(iii)  Develop  measures  to  address  generation  tariff  pricing,  generation  ancillary \nservices pricing, treatment of transmission losses and congestion, stranded cost \nand its treatment, treatment of the emission charge for fossil-fired power plants in \npower market bidding, and methodology for the price ceiling for the bidding in \nspot market. \n \n(iv)  Review international experience on the treatment methods and legal problems of \nthe  existing  long-term  PPA  under  power  market  reforms.  According  to  the \ndifferent  electricity  market  modes  suggested  by  SERC, recommend  feasible \noptions  to  deal  with  the  present  PPAs  and  a  regulatory  framework  on  the \ngeneration tariffs of these power plants. \n \n(v)  Based on the main international regulatory types, experience, and  lessons on \nnetworks services and their relevance in the PRC context, analyze the proper \nrate of return on power network investment in line with the development in power \nnetwork, and calculate the allowable cost and the  rational rate of return for  a \ntypical power network company. \n \n(vi)  Based  on  the  international  electricity  tariff  regulation  frameworks,  main \nexperience  and  lessons  and  their  relevance  in  the  PRC  context,  develop \nelectricity tariff regulation principles in the PRC, including cost compensation \nprinciple, reasonable rate of return principle, and equity principle. \n \n(vii)  Based  on  the  assessment  of  relevant  issues  on electricity tariff regulation, \nrecommend  electricity  tariff  regulation  contents.  According  to  the  electricity \nmarket modes in the PRC, analyze the regulation contents for generation tariff, \ntransmission and distribution tariff, and retail tariff, etc. \n \n(viii)  Based on the  international experience on the classification of electricity end-\nusers, retail tariff setting, and adjustment methods for franchise consumers, \nrecommend the reclassification of consumer category in the PRC and calculate \nthe reasonable end-user tariff for the consumers in typical electricity network by \nconsumer category and by voltage level. \n \n3.  Phase III: Pricing Strategies and Impact Assessment \n \n6.  During phase III, the consultants will do the following \n \n(i)  Evaluate  the  impact  of  the  elimination/reduction  of  cross-subsidies  on \nhouseholds by analyzing household survey data by income groups. Based on the \nrecommendations regarding the subsidy program for vulnerable and low-income \ngroups, determine the Government\u2019s budgetary impacts. \n \n(ii)  Assess the impact of changes in electricity prices, particularly rural tariffs and \nelimination of cross-subsidies, on subsidized consumer groups (particularly the \npoor) and geographical regions. Analyze social impacts on vulnerable groups \nand recommend limits to acceptable levels of welfare loss due to tariff reforms. ", "  Appendix 2  11 \n \nConsult extensively with the concerned Government agencies. In carrying out the \nsocial impact analysis, ensure active participation of vulnerable groups. \n \n(iii)  Assess the impact of subsidies on distorting the economic use of electricity, \nimpeding effective participation of the private sector, and impairing power utilities\u2019 \nperformance  in  a  market-oriented  environment.  Analyze  the  impact  of  the \nsubsidies on the financial performance of power utilities. \n \n(iv)  Assess whether, through the reclassification of consumer categories, changes in \nelectricity prices could be partially absorbed by power utilities, hence mitigating to \nsome extent the impact on consumer groups and geographical regions. \n \n(v)  Recommend the policies and regulatory framework on the direct access under \nthe conditions of competitive power market. Recommend reform measures to \nremove the barriers to tariff reforms. Recommend the preferred authority for \nproposing  and  approving  tariffs  and  tariff  adjustments.  Discuss  if  different \napproaches are needed for tariff setting. \n \n(vi)   Recommend a procedure for regulating electricity tariff, including tariff adjustment \nand disputation settlement procedures. In particular, recommend electricity tariff \nregulation measures and an electricity tariff regulation regime including electricity \ntariff adjustment declaration regime, electricity tariff disputation declaration, and \narbitration regime. \n \n(vii)  Propose tariff setting mechanisms, taking into account the supply costs and the \nconsumers\u2019 willingness and ability. The pricing mechanisms should take into \naccount the LRMC of generation, transmission, and distribution. Where subsidies \nare suggested, they should be clearly identified and rationalized in accordance \nwith ADB policy on subsidies.  Assess whether the cross-subsidies between \nconsumer categories and regions should be removed completely or partly, taking \ninto account relevant experience from developed and developing countries. \n \n(viii)  Assess affordability of electricity for end-users and calculate the affordability for \nthe consumers in  pilot provinces, based on  international experience  with the \ntheories and methodology for  analyzing the affordability of electricity and their \nrelevancies to the PRC. \n \n(ix)   Recommend  mechanisms  for  transparent  delivery  of  subsidies  or  income \ntransfers to vulnerable and low-income groups, to  reach the targeted groups \neffectively and at the lowest cost. If a lifeline tariff is an option, the cost of subsidy \nand the ways in which this subsidy is to be borne by the Government need to be \nassessed,  and  if  other  approaches  such  as  vouchers  to  increase  social \nassistance  payments  are  considered,  such  modalities  need  to  be  carefully \ndesigned to ensure that the targeted groups can be reached within acceptable \ncosts.  Other  options,  such  as  payments  to  compensate  suppliers  for \nnoncommercial power supply obligations to vulnerable and low-income groups or \nremote regions, should also be considered. \n \n(x)  Recommend the optimum strategy, mechanisms, and a time-bound action plan. \nIdentify responsible agencies for implementation of different levels. Identify the \nlegal  and  regulatory  changes  required  for  implementing  the  recommended \npricing strategy. Discuss the relevance of the recommended strategy in the ", "12   Appendix 2 \n \ncontext of the introduction of competitive power market and the PRC social \neconomic conditions. \n \n(xi)  Assess the modes and rules of power markets recommended by SERC. Based \non the  assessment and  the international experiences, recommend generation \npricing that is compatible with market conditions and corresponding  regulatory \ncontent and measure. \n \nB.  Field Study and International Seminar \n \n7.  The consultants will help organize an international seminar on tariff reforms. International \nand domestic experts will be invited to present papers and participate in the discussions. After \nthe seminar, the consultants will prepare a report summarizing the discussions, and identifying \nreforms and development issues of relevance in the PRC context. The consultants will also help \norganize and conduct a field visit with the participation of key SERC staff, as appropriate, involved \nin policymaking and implementation of tariff reforms. The visits will be to selected countries to \ndiscuss with government officials and regulatory bodies the policy and implementation aspects of \nelectricity tariff setting and regulation. On the completion of the field visit, the consultants will \nprepare a report summarizing the main issues and findings of the field visit participants.  \n \nC.  Reports \n \n8.  The consultants will submit the following reports: \n \n(i)  An  Inception  Report.  The  report  will  be  submitted  within  1  month  after  TA \ncommencement,  summarizing  the  initial  findings,  and  suggesting  changes \nneeded (if any) in the TA's approach, methodology, and time schedule. A report \non the international seminar, and a report at the end of the international field visit, \nsummarizing the main issues and findings. \n \n(ii)  Draft Final Report and Workshop. One month will be provided for SERC and \nADB to review the report. The report will be discussed in a consultation workshop \nwith the participation of main electricity consumers, counterpart team, steering \ncommittee members, and key officials from other government agencies involved \nin tariff policy and implementation. ADB staff will participate in the consultation \nworkshop.  The  main  objectives  of  workshop  are  to  (a)  present,  to  the \npolicymakers and stakeholders, the findings and recommendations of the TA; \n(b) facilitate  an  exchange  of  ideas  and  gather  comments;  (c)  increase  the \nownership  and  commitment  to  the  TA  recommendations;  and  (d)  allow  the \npolicymakers to discuss the feedback of stakeholders. \n \n(iii)  Final Report and Final Workshop.
