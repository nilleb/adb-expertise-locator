INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support policy makers of the \nfive Central Asian republics\u2013\u2013Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and \nUzbekistan\u2013\u2013to deepen diversified economic growth. The TA activities will focus on spatial \norganization of economic activities with ways to amplify economic potential at the provincial and \nlocal levels through private sector\u2013led investments to spur economic activity and create jobs.1 \n \n2.  The TA project will support the development of a competitiveness diagnostic report for \nCentral Asia, with coverage of country level diversification strategies, prepare tailored road maps \nfor diversified growth approaches in select provinces, provide recommendations and decision \nsupport tools to increase private sector investments, facilitate dialogue between the public and \nprivate sectors, and strengthen public\u2013private sector coordination for diversifying and upgrading \nthe targeted provincial and local economies. The TA project will build on the wide body of \nanalytical  work  that  has  been  undertaken  by  the  development  partners  on  economic \ndiversification and adapt approaches for diversified growth to the Central Asian context. It will \nenable the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to deepen its country-focused approach, in line with \nStrategy 2030.2 Most TA activities will commence in two selected provinces\u2014one in Kazakhstan \nand one in Uzbekistan\u2014and then be scaled-up to provinces in the other countries.  \n \n3.  The TA addresses the long-standing need for development partners to provide sustained \nsupport  to  Central  Asian  governments  for  diversified  growth,  as  highlighted  in  the  country \npartnership strategies. The Central Asian countries, with narrow economic bases and highly \nreliant on commodity exports, have been hit hard by periodic exogenous shocks, usually triggered \nby volatile oil and commodity prices, and most recently by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  All five Central Asian countries are landlocked. Two are upper middle-income economies \n(Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan), while the other three are lower middle-income (Uzbekistan, the \nKyrgyz  Republic,  and  Tajikistan).3 The  agriculture  sector  is  marked  by  its  relatively  low \nproductivity, and accounts for most employment across Central Asia. The five countries are in \nvarious stages of economic diversification, but remain reliant on either hydrocarbon exports \n(Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan), commodities exports (unwrought aluminum in \nTajikistan, and gold in the Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan), or remittances from migrant workers \nfrom the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan (Tajikistan and the Kyrgyz Republic).   \n \n5.  Concentrated export baskets and export markets have made economic growth susceptible \nto external shocks like the global financial crisis of 2007\u20132008, the 2014 oil price shocks, and the \nongoing COVID-19 disruption. Economic growth across Central Asia has not resulted in structural \ntransformation.4 Agriculture's share of total employment averages more than 30% in the five \ncountries, while contributing about 15% of gross domestic product (GDP). The region's economies \nare characterized by high levels of informal employment, high rates of labor migration, high spatial \ndisparity  between  leading  and  lagging  regions,  and  small  and  fragmented  markets.5 The \neconomies of Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic contracted in 2020, while GDP growth slowed \n \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 7 September 2021. \n2  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and Pacific. Manila. \n3  For 2021\u20132022, lower middle-income economies are those with gross national income per capita (Atlas method) of \n$1,046\u2013$4,095, while the range for upper middle-income economies is $4,096\u2013$12,695. \n4  ADB. 2019.

Manila \n \n ", "2 \nin Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Projections are for a gradual recovery in 2021 and \n2022. All five countries are affected by weakened fiscal positions, nascent institutions, and slow \nprogress in transitioning to a market-based economy, which impede efforts to create well-paid, \nproductive, and secure jobs. The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the need for practical \nmeasures to promote diversification and return rapidly to sustainable growth and job creation. \n \n6.  Theories on economic diversification have followed different tracks. One track  cites \nevidence that low-income countries initially specialize in a narrow range of commodities. As per \ncapita GDP increases, the production structure diversifies either within products being produced \nor exported, or through the launch of new products. At higher levels of per capita GDP, production \nmoves toward re-specialization.6 Another track has focused on economic complexity and export-\nled  industrial  development  strategies.  The  goal  here  has  been  to  identify  new  economic \nopportunities based on existing capabilities, which can feed into different sectors and products to \nraise  export  sophistication.7 The  productive  development  policies  framework  of  the  Inter-\nAmerican Development Bank provides an approach for vertical support measures for selected \nsectors, combined with horizontal support to improve enabling environments through public inputs \nand market interventions.8 Research by the World Bank on diversification in Eurasian countries \nfocused on strengthening the enabling environment for achieving a balanced portfolio of assets \nby exploiting natural resources responsibly, building infrastructure, and improving human capital.9 \n \n7.  ADB-supported research on diversification has centered on industrial policy, and how \ndevelopment tends to be path-dependent, requiring a stepping-stone approach.10 ADB country \ndiagnostics for Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan used product space analysis to identify areas with the \nhighest potential for the economy to accumulate capabilities, develop sophisticated products, and \nboost the economy.11 Elaborate plans by some  Central Asian countries to diversify and widen \nthe economic base have run into implementation gaps and challenges in reconfiguring public \npolicies to support the new areas of growth.12 In addition, product space analysis as a tool has \ntended to focus more on manufacturing than on services because of data availability constraints \nand a limited policy focus on services\u2014despite the fact that the GDP share of services, including \ntourism, transportation, and direct services exports, has been growing in Central Asian countries.  \n \n8.  Strategies to promote economic diversification in Central Asian countries have included \neasing  regulations;  improving  ease  of  doing  business;  and  creating  free  economic  zones, \ntechnology  and  industrial  parks,  and  business  incubators  (although  results  from  all  these \nstrategies are limited). The success depends on governments\u2019 ability to prioritize new growth \ndrivers, develop location-specific policies, and properly sequence investments. New growth \ndrivers based on existing capabilities raise export sophistication and stimulate production. In \npromoting diversification, governments should consider gender dimensions to create substantive \nopportunities for women-owned businesses, entrepreneurship, and jobs.13  \n \n6  Imbs, Jean, and Romain Wacziarg. 2003.

As part of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Strategy 2030 trade, \ntourism, and economic corridors cluster, ADB is piloting two transnational economic corridors.14 \nThese  are  the  Almaty\u2013Bishkek  Economic  Corridor  and  the  Shymkent\u2013Tashkent\u2013Khujand \nEconomic Corridor (STKEC). These transnational corridors increase regional economic and trade \nintegration  by  promoting  spatially  balanced  growth  that  prioritizes  economies  of  scale, \nagglomeration, specialization, and diversification of economic activities. In South Asia, ADB is \nalso providing support for the Chennai\u2013Kanyakumari Industrial Corridor in India, which aims to \nstimulate manufacturing in two nodes in the state of Tamil Nadu by integrating urban and industrial \nclusters and promoting links with regional value chains and global production networks.15 \n \n10.  Lessons from these economic corridor projects underscore the crucial role that corridor \ndevelopment can play in bringing about spatial transformation and agglomeration and promoting \ndiversification  of  economic  activities.  These  projects  have  highlighted  the  importance  of \nconducting upstream analysis on the economic potential of provincial and local areas, identifying \npromising  segments  for  attracting  private  investment  while  ensuring  optimal  institutional \narrangements  between national  and  local  governments to  coordinate corridor  development \nactivities. This TA project will incorporate these lessons in support of government programs to \nupgrade and diversify targeted regions of Central Asia, complementing ongoing reforms to \nimprove the enabling environment for private sector investments in prioritized growth drivers. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: ability of governments to catalyze diversified \neconomic growth in the five Central Asian countries improved.16 The TA will have the following \noutcome: increased public and private sector investments for diversified growth realized.17  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n12.  Output 1: Competitiveness diagnostic report developed. The TA will develop an \nupstream competitiveness diagnostic report that will identify emerging lessons from efforts of the \nfive Central Asian countries and from other parts of the world to diversify and upgrade economies, \nincluding improving the enabling environment for private sector participation. The report will \ninclude coverage of country level diversification strategies that support competitiveness at the \nlocal  level.  The  diagnostic  report  will  analyze  new  issues  arising  from  COVID-19-related \ndisruptions such as changes to regional value chains and the need for green growth-led recovery \nand digitization, as well as the gender aspects of these challenges and opportunities. It will build \non existing analytical work available on diversification and formulate pathways to improve the \nparticipation level of countries in global and regional value chains by reducing country-specific \nconstraints on factor endowments (like availability of skilled labor, access to private capital), \ngeography, market size, and regulatory institutions. The upstream focus of the diagnostic report \nwill be on identifying new growth drivers in industry (including in agro-based industry) and services \n \n14 ADB. 2017.

Output 2: Tailored road maps for implementation in selected provinces prepared. \nUnder this output, tailored road maps for selected provinces covering priority sectors, subsectors, \nand products will be developed. Initially, one province each will be selected in Uzbekistan and \nKazakhstan, in consultation with their respective governments. Based on initial discussions, \nUzbekistan (Tashkent city and region, which combined has the country\u2019s highest per capita gross \nregional product) and Kazakhstan (Turkistan Province, where per capita gross regional product \nis among the lowest in the country) are the indicative regions. This will be further finalized in \nconsultation with the governments and the ADB country teams, based on criteria such as potential \nto leverage existing the industry base (including services and agro-based industry), job creation, \nand to move up the production value chain. The road maps will identify potential investment \nopportunities for transnational economic corridor development in the selected countries and \nprovinces, such as the STKEC linking Turkestan Province, Tashkent region, and Sugd Province \nin Tajikistan. These road maps will enable sequenced actions and investments in clusters (urban \nnodes), connectors (supply chains), institutions (policy and regulation for enabling environment, \nbusiness, and skills development), and market links (regional and global value chains). The road \nmaps will employ province-, sector-, and/or product-level data on industrial output and trade, and \nsex-disaggregated data on employment, occupations, wages, and workforce skills.    \n \n14.  Output 3: Decision support tools to strengthen private sector investments in the \nselected provinces developed. Findings from outputs 1 and 2 will be repurposed as a tool kit \nthat can be used for other provinces as well and that will identify roles for the public and private \nsectors in stimulating diversification. The tool kit will include decision support tools to help policy \nmakers prioritize new growth drivers at the provincial level based on existing sector and factor \nendowments. The tool kit will provide strategic actions for creating jobs including for increased \nparticipation by women, moving up regional and global value chains and meeting regional and \ndomestic demand. Transitioning to a green and low-carbon economy, climate issues, regional \nintegration, digitization, and gender considerations to create jobs for women and opportunities for \nfemale entrepreneurs and women-owned businesses will be key priorities. The tool kit will also \ncontain mechanisms to analyze ways to deepen trade links with partner countries and integration \nwithin Central Asia. \n  \n15.  Output 4: Public\u2013private dialogue and coordination on economic diversification \nfacilitated. Under this output, the  TA team will directly engage with the private sector  by \norganizing a series of policy dialogues with key government agencies. The dialogues will focus \non  easing  constraints  in  the  business  environment;  institutional  and  regulatory  support  for \nexpanded private investment in new and promising areas; and growth drivers for economic \ndiversification. Steering committees with focal points from the ministries of economy or investment \nand relevant members of provincial governments will be formed. These committees will include \nprivate sector representatives and will guide preparation of the road maps and decision-support \ntools, ensure alignment of TA activities with national industrial policies, and suggest ways to \nstrengthen public\u2013private cooperation to support economic diversification. The TA team will align \nits work with and incorporate lessons from the ongoing TA projects supporting the development \nof the Almaty\u2013Bishkek Economic Corridor and the STKEC, as well as ADB economic corridor \ndevelopment projects in other countries and regions (e.g., India and South Asia). \n \n ", "5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $700,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund ($450,000 from TASF 7 and $250,000 from TASF-other \nsources). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. The governments will provide \nsupport in the form of counterpart staff, office supplies, domestic transportation, and other in-kind \ncontributions. The governments will ensure consultants\u2019 access to data and information as \nneeded.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  the  Regional  Cooperation  and  Operations \nCoordination Division of the Central and West Asia Department will administer the TA, in \nconsultation  with  the  ADB  resident  missions  in  the  five  countries  and  the  TA  steering \ncommittees.18 Regular steering committee meetings will ensure the sustained involvement of the \nlocal governments and private sector. Although the TA work will commence in just two countries, \nadditional countries will be included on a rolling basis depending on requests received from the \ngovernments.
