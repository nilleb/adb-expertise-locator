THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \n1.  Pakistan, the world\u2019s fifth-most populous country, is a lower-middle-income country with a \ngross national income per capita of $1,383 in 2019. The country faces severe poverty challenges. \nWhile the poverty rate fell from 36.8% in 2011 to 24.3% in 2016, 24.3% of the population (or \naround 50 million people) live below the national poverty line. In addition, another 20 million \npeople are near poor and highly vulnerable to shocks that could pull them below the poverty line. \nPersistent cycles of low human capital investment, especially for women, and poor health \noutcomes are the main factors behind this chronic intergenerational poverty and continued gender \ninequality. 1  Despite  its  lower-middle-income  status,  Pakistan  remains  one  of  the  lowest \nperformers in human capital development in South Asia. Health outcomes in Pakistan remain \npoor, with one of the highest maternal mortality ratios in the region at 178 per 100,000 live births. \nIt ranks third in global stunting and wasting and has the highest stunting rate in South Asia\u2014about \n45% of children under five are stunted. Health care expenditure remains a critical risk factor for \nkeeping people in poverty or pulling people into poverty. Out-of-pocket health care expenditure, \nfor example, accounts for two thirds of all health care expenditure in Pakistan. In addition, almost \n23 million children are out of school and only about half of the population has completed primary \neducation. Net enrollment rates for lower and higher secondary education remain low at 49% and \n31% respectively. Only 12% of Pakistan\u2019s youth graduate beyond grade 12.2 Spending on health, \nnutrition and education is 3.0% of Pakistan\u2019s gross domestic product, lower than most countries \nin Asia. This situation has worsened as a result of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) \npandemic and the subsequent pressure on the public health system, as well as the economic \nslowdown and loss of incomes and jobs. Since the onset of the pandemic, there is a high likelihood \nthat the poverty trend could be reversed in the future. \n \n2.  The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified the need to improve, expand, and scale-up the \ncoverage and financial assistance provided under Pakistan\u2019 social protection programs, including \nthe Benazir Income Support Program (BISP). BISP, Pakistan\u2019s flagship social protection program \nand one of South Asia\u2019s largest safety net initiatives, was established in 2008 as an autonomous \norganization to provide financial assistance to the poor through the implementation of targeted \nprograms to reduce poverty and promote equitable distribution of economic resources. These \ninclude an unconditional cash transfer (UCT) program, called Kafaalat, to provide a financial \ncushion for the poor and improve household nutritional consumption, and a conditional cash \ntransfer (CCT) program, called Waseela-e-Taleem, to incentivize enrolment of children from \nbeneficiary families into primary schools. In 2019, the government launched its social protection \nand poverty alleviation program, Ehsaas, to create a comprehensive welfare state.3 Its main \npillars include: (1) addressing elite capture and making the government system work for equality, \n(2) safety nets, (3) human capital development, and (4) jobs and livelihoods. BISP supports pillar \n2, which support cash transfer and poverty graduation programs. BISP is also expanding its \nsupport to pillar 3, with CCTs for education, health, and nutrition being explored. In addition, the \ngovernment, with support from development partners, has also been utilizing BISP to counter the \ndetrimental impacts caused by COVID-19. \n \n3.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will maintain support for social protection and poverty \nalleviation to build the resilience of vulnerable families and individuals in Pakistan. ADB is \nassessing the viability of a $300 million results-based lending (RBL) program to provide further \nwomen-focused support to Ehsaas for system strengthening and improved governance, and \n \n1  ADB.

The indicative program scope will include: (i) institutional and \norganizational capacity for social protection under UCT and CCT strengthened, (ii) CCT for \nprimary education expanded; and (iii) the design and implementation of pilot CCT for nutrition \nevaluated. The impact of the program is aligned with Ehsaas to \u201calleviate poverty, reduce \ninequality and achieve inclusive and sustainable human capital development\u201d. The outcome will \nbe \u201cincreased social protection coverage and access to education, health services and nutrition \nrequirements for poor households\u201d. The overall Ehsaas expenditures are estimated to be $5.6 \nbillion from FY2020 to FY2024. The proposed RBL program (FY2021\u2013FY2024) is estimated to \ncost $1.3 billion, among which ADB loan will contribute $300 million (23.1%) through ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources (regular loan). The proposed RBL program and transaction technical \nassistance  (TA)  are  aligned  with  (i)  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030,  which  emphasizes  addressing \nremaining poverty by supporting social protection, reducing gender inequalities and strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity;4 (ii) pillar 2 from the forthcoming country partnership \nstrategy, 2021\u20132025, that is, building resilience by strengthening human capital and social \nprotection;5 (iii) the forthcoming country operational business plan, 2021\u20132023;6 and (iv) ADB\u2019s \nSocial  Protection  Operational  Plan,  2014\u20132020.  A  transaction  technical  assistance  (TA)  is \nrequired to prepare the RBL program. The due diligence work and assessments to be conducted \nunder the TA include: (i) the design of the RBL program; (ii) the soundness of BISP\u2019s investment \nprogram,  results  and  links  with  disbursements  under  the  RBL  program,  expenditures  and \nfinancing, and implementation arrangements; (iii) fiduciary and financial management systems; \n(iv) safeguard systems (environmental, social, gender and climate change); (v) procurement \nsystems; (vi) monitoring and evaluation systems, and (vii) lessons learned from implementation \nof previous ADB engagement. As a result of the assessments, a program action plan (PAP) will \nbe developed, including strengthening of BISP staff capacity. A program result framework and \nmatrix  will  also  be  prepared  with  clear  result  indicators,  including  those  to  be  chosen  as \ndisbursement-linked indicators. The TA will commence activities in December 2020 and be \ncompleted by December 2021.7  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Justification \n4.  The  proposed  program  will  be  financed  under  the  RBL  modality  which  supports \ngovernment-owned sector programs, and links disbursements directly to the achievement of \nprogram results. The TA is required to conduct due diligence as required for the RBL modality, \nprepare the preliminary design of the program and assess the scope and scale for cofinancing \nand partnerships. The design of the RBL program include ex ante assessments of the program \nand its systems, aligning the results framework with the government\u2019s overall strategy in the \nsector, and identification of measures and actions for systematic institutional development. The \nTA will assess the soundness of the government\u2019s comprehensive social protection and poverty \nalleviation program, Ehsaas, and its suitability as the basis for the proposed RBL program. \n \n5.  The TA will: (i) conduct  sector and institutional analysis; (ii) undertake fiduciary (financial \nmanagement,  procurement,  and  anticorruption),  safeguard  (social  and  environmental),  and \nexpenditure  framework,  poverty,  social,  and  gender  assessment,  results  framework  and \n \n4  ADB. 2018.
