INTRODUCTION \n1.  This paper proposes that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) (i) establish the Pacific \nBusiness Investment Trust Fund; (ii) accept and administer grant contributions to the trust fund \nfrom bilateral, multilateral, and other sources, in each case substantially in accordance with the \nterms and conditions set forth in this paper; and (iii) administer a portion of technical assistance \n(TA) for the Pacific Business Investment Facility, to be financed on a grant basis from the trust \nfund.  \n \n2.  This paper describes the objective, scope, and implementation arrangements of the trust \nfund and the arrangements for ADB\u2019s administration of grant contributions to the trust fund. Any \nproposal  to  administer  non-grant  contributions  to  the  trust  fund  and  any  changes  to  the \nobjective, scope, and implementation arrangements of the trust fund resulting from it will be \nsubmitted for approval to ADB\u2019s Board of Directors.1 This paper also serves as the TA report for \nthe Pacific Business Investment Facility. \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n3.  Pacific  island  countries  face  significant  and  complex  development  challenges  that \nconstrain private sector growth.2 Challenges include the high cost of doing business, inadequate \ninfrastructure, outdated legal systems, inadequate business and technical advisory services, \nand land rights issues. The financial sector is underdeveloped, with a low ratio of private sector \ncredit to gross domestic product.3 Businesses of all sizes have difficulty securing commercial \nfinance in the Pacific. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are particularly affected, \nbecause commercial banks in the region extend little credit to this segment. Opportunities for \nbusinesses to raise additional capital through stock exchanges are also limited. There are no \nprivate equity funds in the region and no near-term prospects for new funds. Since 2010, the \neconomic ministers of the Pacific Islands Forum have annually called on development partners \nto help increase access to finance for SMEs.4 The Government of Australia expressed interest \nin working with ADB to design innovative approaches to address the financing constraint faced \nby SMEs. ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 emphasizes ADB\u2019s intention to expand \nsupport for SME finance.5 \n \n4.  In 2013, ADB reviewed (i) private equity funds and other finance facilities in the Pacific, \n(ii) the financial sector and supply of and demand for business advisory services by country, (iii) \nthe experience of hybrid risk finance and business advisory support facilities in other regions, \nand (iv) potential models for the Pacific region.6 The review found that to ease the financing \n                                                 \n1  Discussions on potential non-grant contributions to the trust fund are ongoing. \n2  In this paper, the term Pacific island countries refers to the following countries: the Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, the \nMarshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, \nTonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. \n3  The ratio of private sector credit to gross domestic product ranges from 19.4% in the Federated States of \nMicronesia to 77.9% in Fiji. By comparison, the ratio for the East Asia\u2013Pacific region is 120.3%. Calculations are \nbased  on  data  for  2012  sourced  from  International  Monetary  Fund.  2013.

Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n6  The review included more than 110 interviews with stakeholders in five Pacific developing member countries from \nthe public sector, private sector and civil society, commercial banks, and providers of business advisory services. \nIn addition, ADB convened a series of stakeholder roundtable meetings with development partners, commercial \n \n ", "2 \nconstraint faced by SMEs, government and development partner efforts should aim to unlock \nthe excess liquidity that commercial financiers have in almost all Pacific island countries. While \ncommercial banks report an interest in increasing lending to SMEs, they remain hesitant. Their \ncredit policies and products favor larger clients and short-term investments. The banks, which \nare highly risk averse, have expressed concerns over SMEs having weak internal management \ncapacity  (including  limited  financial  management  skills),  as  well  as  insufficient  shareholder \ncapital and acceptable collateral. Proposals put to banks by SMEs generally lack the rigor \nrequired  from  a  business  and  financial  plan.  As  a  result,  credit  is  often  unavailable  or \nunaffordable for SMEs at offered terms. \n \n5.  Tailored business advisory services are needed to reduce financier concerns about \nSMEs\u2019  internal  capacities.  While  these  services  are  available  in  the  larger  Pacific  island \ncountries, their focus is on large, predominantly foreign-owned enterprises, governments, and \ndevelopment partners. In contrast, business development centers, where they exist, cater to \nmicroenterprises  and  informal  sector  operators.  This  leaves  SMEs  unserved.7 Building  the \nmanagerial and technical capacity of these entrepreneurs is essential to improve the business \nrisk profile with financiers.8 Further, in the underdeveloped Pacific financial markets, innovative \nfinancing arrangements are required to leverage and supplement commercial finance. These \nmeasures facilitate access to finance for SMEs to expand and diversify, and would absorb \nexcess  bank  liquidity.  They  would  complement  ongoing  private  sector  development  and \nfinancial sector reforms, including secured transactions reforms, which will increase access to \nfinance by SMEs over time, but will not alone bridge the financing gap.9  \n \n6.  Business financing and development programs have been implemented in the Pacific \nand other regions by bilateral development  partners, development finance institutions, and \nprivate fund management companies for many years. The following lessons have been drawn \nfrom these programs: (i) managerial and technical advice to SMEs, pre- and post-finance, is \nessential for leveraging commercial finance; (ii) SMEs must contribute to the cost of advisory \nservices to ensure buy-in, and must see the advice provided as independent, objective, and \nconfidential; (iii) extensive collaboration with commercial financiers and other stakeholders is \nvital to achieve the intended impact and lower implementation cost; (iv) SMEs typically demand \nless than $300,000 in finance, which finance facilities with a commercial mandate have been \nunable to respond to effectively; (v) where finance is provided, self-liquidating instruments are \npreferred to prevent exit issues; (vi) expansion of existing businesses is less risky and more \nlikely to succeed than establishment of new ventures; (vii) maintaining an in-country advisory \npresence in many countries is not cost-effective; and (viii) building in-country advisory capacity \n                                                                                                                                                          \nbanks, and private equity fund managers hosted by ADB\u2019s Pacific Liaison and Coordination Office (PLCO) to \ndetermine root causes and options to address these challenges. Further information is in the Rationale and Option \nAnalysis  (Supplementary  Appendix  D)  and  Lessons  from  Business  Financing  and  Development  Programs \n(Supplementary Appendix E). Supplementary appendixes are available on request. \n7  SMEs are hesitant to seek business advice from the large accounting and professional services firms (if present in \nthe country) as fees are deemed exorbitant; they do not present themselves to serve local SMEs; and market their \nservices to large foreign-owned businesses, the government, and development partners. Furthermore, SMEs often \ndo not realize the importance of sourcing such advisory support, or may be concerned about the quality, \nindependence, and confidentiality of the advice available. \n8  Further information is provided in the Rationale and Option Analysis (Supplementary Appendix D). In addition, \nextensive research on the availability and requirements for business advisory services was carried out in the early- \nto  mid-2000s  by  ADB  and  the  South  Pacific  Project  Facility.

The trust fund\u2019s objective, through the implementation of regional TA and the provision \nof  concessional  loans,  is  the  private  sector\u2019s  sustainable  growth  in  selected  Pacific  island \ncountries.11 It will help SMEs in the region realize commercial success and sustainability with (i) \nfinance raised from commercial sources, including trade and supply chain finance; (ii) expanded \nor diversified operations; (iii) jobs created and saved; and (iv) increased gross profits. The trust \nfund,  through  the  TA,  will  primarily  finance  business  advisory  services  to  SMEs  seeking \ncommercial finance. The trust fund will also provide concessional loans to a small number of \nSMEs, in parallel with commercial finance, and facilitate links to trade and supply chain finance. \nTarget  SMEs  for  business  advisory  services  and  concessional  loans  have  at  least  five \nemployees and seek $100,000\u2013$1 million in finance, but typically less than $300,000. SMEs in \nall sectors will be eligible.12 \n \n8.  The  TA  will  extend  business  advisory  services  to  selected  SMEs  in  Pacific  island \ncountries to enable them to attract commercial finance, including trade and supply chain finance \nprovided by ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD). Advisory services will be \ntailored to business needs, and may include support for (i) business planning; (ii) financial \nmanagement, including determining short- and long-term financing needs and potential sources; \n(iii)  corporate  governance;  (iv)  marketing;  and  (v)  specialized  technical  skills  for  product \ndevelopment, product certification, and export. Support will be provided pre- and post-finance; \nall SMEs provided with specialist consultancy support, in addition to advice provided by a \ndesignated business advisor, will be expected to contribute to these services\u2019 costs.  \n \n9.  The trust fund will provide concessional loans to selected eligible SMEs, following the \ntrust fund\u2019s implementation guidelines.13 Concessional loans will only be provided in parallel \nwith commercial finance and will rank equally and without preference. The financing plan must \ncomprise  at  least  50%  commercial  finance.  Loans  provided  will  have  concessional  terms, \nincluding interest rate, grace period, and repayment term, which will be determined case by \ncase. The trust fund will respond to market failures and constraints, and will apply best practice \nprinciples on deploying concessional finance.14 While ADB will provide no direct contribution or \nparallel financing, links will be facilitated to PSOD for trade and/or supply chain finance. \n                                                 \n10 Further  information  is  in  Lessons  from  Business  Financing  and  Development  Programs  (Supplementary \nAppendix E).  \n11 SMEs in the following Pacific developing member countries will be eligible for trust fund and TA support: the Cook \nIslands, Fiji, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, \nSamoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. No activities will be undertaken in participating countries \nuntil no-objection letters have been obtained. \n12 Activities on ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list or assigned environment category A will not be financed.  \n13 The trust fund will provide concessional loans to eligible SMEs, with indicative terms set out in the Trust Fund \nImplementation  Guidelines  (Supplementary  Appendix  A).  Instruments  and  indicative  terms  will  be  reviewed \nannually, and modifications agreed upon, at the annual meeting between ADB and the financing partners. Finance \nmay be provided for working capital and capital expenditure. \n14 The provision of finance on concessional terms, in parallel with commercial finance, is commonly referred to as \nblended finance. Principles for deploying concessional finance include (i) providing additionality, (ii) addressing \nmarket  constraints  while  avoiding  market  distortions,  (iii)  using  a  tailored  approach,  (iv)  ensuring  minimal \nconcessionality, (v) being time-bound and transitional, and (vi) monitoring social and/or economic results. The \nproposed application must be expected to be financially viable and sustainable. The trust fund\u2019s implementation \nguidelines detail these principles.  \n ", "4 \n10.

ADB\u2019s Pacific Department (PARD) will act as the focal point on technical matters for \nfinancing  partners.17 The  trust  fund  and  TA  will  be  implemented  through  a  core  team  of \nconsultants with technical and administrative expertise serving in a project management unit \n(PMU) in the Pacific Liaison and Coordination Office (PLCO), under the supervision of ADB\u2019s \ntechnical assistance supervising unit (TASU) officer. The consultant team will include a facility \nmanager,  business  advisors,  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  consultant,  and  accounting  and \nadministration resources. A finance-structuring consultant will structure financing proposals. In-\ncountry coordinators may be engaged. Specialized short-term consultants will be engaged to \nsupport activities and for specific business advisory assignments. \n \n15.  The  TASU  officer  will  chair  an  internal  management  committee  to  select  SMEs  to \nreceive specialist business advisory services. The committee will comprise the TASU officer and \nfull-time  TA  consultants.  The  committee  will  apply  criteria  set  forth  in  the  implementation \nguidelines. The specialist services will be provided under mandate letters, after the designated \nbusiness advisor, in close consultation with the business and its commercial financiers, assess \nthe scope of the support required. SMEs will be required to contribute to the service costs.18 \n \n16.  An independent finance committee will select SMEs that will receive concessional loans. \nIt will (i) guide the implementation of the trust fund\u2019s financing strategy, (ii) recommend changes \nto the financing strategy, (iii) approve financing concepts to proceed to due diligence, (iv) \napprove terms and documentation for concessional loans, (v) review the portfolio of outstanding \nloans, and (vi) review audit and compliance reports for financed SMEs. The finance committee \nwill comprise five to seven independent members, engaged through the TA, one of whom will be \nthe chair. Members will have significant investment, finance, and/or business expertise in the \nPacific. The implementation guidelines will set out the minimum qualifications and selection \ncriteria for finance committee members. ADB will select the committee members, following the \nimplementation guidelines.19  \n \n17.  In approving the terms of concessional loans, the finance committee will ensure that the \nfollowing  criteria  are  met:  (i)  the  application  of  concessionality  is  sufficiently  justified  as  a \nresponse  to  a  market  constraint,  (ii)  the  minimum  concessionality  necessary  to  overcome \nconstraints is applied, (iii) the proposed application would not distort the commercial market, \nand (iv) the financing plan comprises at least 50% commercial finance provided in parallel and \nranked equally and without preference. The proposed application must be expected to be \nfinancially viable and sustainable.  \n \n18.  ADB\u2019s Office of Cofinancing Operations will facilitate contributions to the trust fund and \nact as the official channel for communicating financial issues between financing partners, ADB, \nand  the  trust  fund.  It  will  also  lead  the  discussions  with  financing  partners  on  procedural \nagreements for contributions. \n \n19.  Implementation guidelines setting out the governance structure and activities eligible for \nfunding under the trust fund and the TA will be developed and agreed upon by ADB and the \nfinancing partners. The implementation guidelines may be amended with prior approval from \n                                                 \n17 The term financing partners refers to contributors to the trust fund. \n18 The mandate agreement will set out the cost-sharing arrangements, which will be calculated on a percentage of the \nremuneration for specialist and/or technical services assigned to the project, at a minimum of 10%. Contributions to \nthe cost of such specialist advisory services will be paid to the Pacific Business Investment Trust Fund.   \n19 ADB\u2019s Office of Risk Management and PSOD will support the selection of finance committee members.  \n ", "6 \nADB  and  the  financing  partners\u2019  representatives.  PARD  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day \nimplementation of the trust fund and TA, following the implementation guidelines. \n \n20.  Financing partners and ADB will annually review and agree on the volume of trust fund \nresources, including income and net of expenses, to be allocated to concessional loans.20 \nFurther  details  are  provided  in  the  implementation  guidelines.  This  will  be  subject  to \nidentification, due diligence, structuring, and approval of the provision of concessional loans by \nthe finance committee, following the implementation guidelines.  \n \n21.  The operations of the trust fund will be in accordance with the implementation guidelines \nand will comply with ADB\u2019s policies and procedures applicable from time to time in respect of \nfunds administered by ADB, including ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009); and social \nprotection, anticorruption, and other integrity policies, procedures, principles, and guidelines. As \nestablished  in  the  trust  fund\u2019s  implementation  guidelines,  due  diligence  will  include  an \nassessment of safeguard risks. Activities on ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list will not \nbe financed.21 Appropriate arrangements for project accounting, auditing, and close monitoring \nand reporting will be in place for all activities, and are set out in the implementation guidelines. \nConsulting services and procurement financed by the trust fund will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Guidelines \n(2013, as amended from time to time). \n \n22.  Except  as  may  be  indicated  otherwise,  ADB\u2019s  operational  policies  and  procedures \napplicable to its nonsovereign operations do not apply to trust fund investments. Investments \nwill be made by ADB acting solely in its capacity as trustee of the financing partners, whose \nresources may be used to provide loans to SMEs on concessional terms.22 \n \nV.  PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE                                                  \nPACIFIC BUSINESS INVESTMENT FACILITY \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n23.  The TA\u2019s impact will be the sustainable growth of the private sector in selected Pacific \nisland countries. The outcome will be commercially successful and sustainable SMEs in Pacific \nisland countries. It is expected that (i) at least $15 million of additional finance will be leveraged \nfrom commercial sources; (ii) at least 100 supported SMEs will expand or diversify operations; \n                                                 \n20  At the time of approval, the trust fund is expected to provide up to $3,000,000 in concessional loans to about \n10 SMEs.  \n21 Any category A activities for environment will not be supported. Any requirement for land will be facilitated through \nlease agreement or negotiated settlement to avoid triggering the involuntary resettlement safeguard. No distinct or \nvulnerable indigenous peoples groups will be affected by the investments, so the indigenous peoples safeguard is \nnot triggered.  \n22 The ADB President has waived the requirement to apply Operations Manual section D10/OP (Nonsovereign \nOperations) to the trust fund. The waiver is required because (i) responsibility for administering the nonsovereign \ncomponent of the trust fund (i.e., the provision of loans to beneficiary SMEs from trust fund resources) will be given \nto PARD, and (ii) the business and credit approval process under Operations Manual section D10/OP will not be \napplied as, instead, the trust fund will have a tailored business and credit approval process that is better suited to \nthe size and concessional terms of the loans. This arrangement is considered appropriate given (i) the pilot nature \nof the proposal to address the constraints faced by SMEs in fragile Pacific economies, (ii) the small size and \nconcessional terms of loans and the overall size of the facility, and (iii) that concessional loans will only be provided \nin parallel with commercial finance. The loan approval process has been reviewed and agreed with ADB\u2019s Office of \nthe General Counsel and Office of Risk Management, and is described in detail in the trust fund\u2019s implementation \nguidelines (Supplementary Appendix A). ", "7 \nand (iii) at least 1,000 jobs will be created or saved in supported SMEs. The TA\u2019s design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.23 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n24.  Output 1: Business advisory services provided to SMEs in selected Pacific island \ncountries. The TA will deliver advisory services following para. 8. The TA will identify SMEs \nthat  seek  commercial  finance  through  referrals  from  commercial  financiers,  chambers  of \ncommerce, business associations, and other stakeholders. The PMU will assess and process \nrequests for support. An eligible SME will be assigned a designated business advisor who will (i) \nmaintain the client relationship throughout its involvement with the TA; (ii) advise, guide, and \nreview the client\u2019s financing needs; (iii) support the client in developing a bankable proposal for \ncommercial financiers to consider where the proposal is assessed commercially viable; (iv) \nidentify the need for and source-specific technical expertise; and (v) refer and link clients with \nbusiness support programs funded by development partners in the region to leverage their \nresources and expertise, where appropriate. Business advisory services and specific technical \nexpertise will be sourced from the region where possible. SMEs will only receive business \nadvisory services for one funding cycle (commercial finance only or a concessional loan in \nparallel with commercial finance). These measures, including the cost sharing for specialist \nand/or technical services, will help develop a market for local business advisory services.  \n \n25.  Output 2: Concessional loans from the Pacific Business Investment Trust Fund \nreceived by selected SMEs in parallel with commercial finance. SMEs that have received \nadvisory services and have insufficient finance from commercial sources will be considered for a \nconcessional loan from the trust fund (para. 9). The TA will identify candidates for concessional \nloans  from  the  trust  fund.  It  will  lead  in  identification  of  beneficiary  SMEs,  due  diligence, \napproval processes, and administration post-finance. A finance-structuring consultant will (i) \nassess and structure financing proposals, (ii) prepare all the documentation required for the \nfinance  committee,  and  (iii)  review  the  performance  of  the  SMEs  and  concessional  loan \nportfolio. The TA will engage the independent finance committee members (para. 16). The TA \nwill also support the development of other financing modalities that meet the needs of SMEs, \nsuch as trade finance.24 Implementation of all activities will follow the trust fund\u2019s implementation \nguidelines, as amended over time. \n \n26.  Output 3: Project management services effectively delivered. A PMU will be set up \nin the PLCO and will manage day-to-day implementation of the TA. The TASU officer will \noversee its staff of full-time consultants (para. 14). The PMU will prepare annual work programs, \nquarterly progress reports, and annual reports. A monitoring and evaluation consultant will \ndesign a project monitoring and evaluation framework at TA inception. This will capture baseline \ndata, gender-disaggregated where appropriate, for all indicators. A comprehensive stakeholder \ncommunication and marketing strategy will be established to help disseminate good practices \nand lessons. The PMU will organize an annual meeting of ADB and the financing partners, \nwhich will provide strategic guidance and assess performance. \n \n27.  Key assumptions are that (i) business advisory services and concessional finance from \nthe trust fund will leverage commercial finance, and will help SMEs to consolidate, grow, and \ndiversify; (ii) SMEs are interested in and willing to make a contribution for advisory services; and \n                                                 \n23 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 1 April 2014.  \n24 At least 10% of the consultants\u2019 time is expected to be allocated to support trade and supply chain finance. \n ", "8 \n(iii) links with business support programs funded by development partners can lead to the \nprovision of timely and effective advisory services to referred SMEs.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n28.  The TA is estimated to cost $12,500,000, of which $1,500,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Others), and $11,000,000 will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the trust fund and administered by ADB. The detailed cost \n \nestimates and financing plans are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n29.  ADB will be the executing agency.25 The TA will be implemented over 5 years from \nSeptember 2014 until August 2019. It will require a total of 395 person-months of international \nconsultants and 144 person-months of national consultants.26 ADB will engage the consultants \nfollowing its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \nImplementation will start in the larger Pacific island countries (Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and \nSolomon Islands) and will gradually be extended to others when appropriate. The TA will begin \nwith a facility manager, two business advisors, a monitoring and evaluation officer, and an \nadministrative  officer;  it  will  be  gradually  expanded  up  to  eight  full-time  consultants\u2014five \ninternational  (228  person-months)  and  three  national  (144  person-months)\u2014hired  under \nindividual consultant selection.27 The recruitment process for full-time consultants will include \npanel interviews. A finance-structuring consultant (international, 20 person-months, intermittent) \nwill be recruited under individual consultant selection. In-country private sector coordinators \n(international and/or national, 36 person-months) may be recruited using individual consultant \nselection. Specialized short-term consultants (international and/or national, 105 person-months) \nwill be recruited through individual consultant selection and/or indefinite delivery contract.28 \nSpecialized  short-term  consultants  will  be  required  for  specific  on-demand  assignments  to \nsupport individual SMEs and may support the development of other financing modalities such \nas trade finance. Finance committee members (international, 6 person-months, intermittent) will \nbe recruited through individual consultant selection or on indefinite delivery contracts, and will \nserve pro bono, with expenses paid. ADB will organize finance committee meetings, training, \nworkshops,  and  conferences.  ADB  will  procure  all  office  space,  equipment,  and  materials \nfollowing  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  At  TA \ncompletion, equipment and materials will be retained by ADB or transferred to subsequent \nphases of the TA.  \n \n                                                 \n25 PARD will implement the TA and will draw on specific expertise from other departments (PSOD, Office of Risk \nManagement, Controller\u2019s Department, and Office of Cofinancing Operations) as appropriate. \n26 The consultants will be recruited on an individual basis as (i) the five international specialist positions are diverse \nand  complex, and fulfill  sensitive roles requiring a high degree of personal integrity; (ii) cost-effectiveness criteria \nalso apply to recruiting national administrative staff on an individual basis; (iii) it is unlikely that any firm would have \nthe expertise to provide the required long- and short-term international experts in highly specialized areas at \nacceptable rates; and (iv) the required expertise for short-term international consultants will be tailored to needs.   \n27  The full-time consultant team will be recruited during TA implementation as activities grow. One national and two \ninternational consultants will be recruited in the third year for full-time input in the fourth and fifth years.  \n28  For this TA paper, in-country private sector coordinators and specialized short-term consultants are assumed to be \ninternational consultants. Placement of coordinators will be agreed with ADB Pacific field offices. Indefinite delivery \ncontracts may be used for the selection of firms in Pacific island countries where competent and cost-effective local \nprofessional  firms  may  be  identified  and  the  rates  for  their  services  agreed  before  any  demand-driven \nengagements, primarily to provide accounting, auditing, and tax advice. ", "9 \n30.  TA proceeds will be disbursed in line with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time) and other specific arrangements as detailed in \nthe implementation guidelines.29 ADB\u2019s Controller\u2019s Department will undertake accounting for \nthe trust fund, including loans the trust fund provides to SMEs. Payments that clients contribute \nto business advisory services costs (subject to mandate agreements) and repayments of loans \n(interest and principal) will be made to the trust fund account.  \n \nVI.  CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE TRUST FUND \n31.  ADB will accept grant contributions to the trust fund from bilateral, multilateral, and other \nsources  through  the  signing  of  a  memorandum  of  understanding  between  ADB  and  each \nfinancing partner. Memoranda of understanding will be substantially in accordance with the \nterms and conditions of this paper and the implementation guidelines. \n \n32.  Contributions to the trust fund will be made in cash in a freely convertible currency. \nContributions will be deposited into a United States (US) dollar interest-bearing account that \nADB specifies. The depository bank will convert contributions received in currencies other than \nUS dollars into US dollars at the then-prevailing market rate and transfer them to the respective \naccount. \n \n33.  ADB  will  hold,  administer,  and  invest  contributions  at  its  discretion.  Pending \ndisbursements, ADB may invest and reinvest contributions. Any income earned from such \ninvestment and reinvestment, as well as interest accrued on the account (the available funds \nnet of expenses), will be credited to the account and used for the fund\u2019s purposes, including \nrelated administrative expenses. 30 \n \n34.  ADB will make withdrawals from the account as necessary to meet expenditures for \nactivities supported by the available funds. 31 If other currencies are required for payment to \nmeet eligible expenditures, ADB may purchase those currencies with the available funds. Any \nfees and charges relating to such purchase will be paid out of the account. \n \n35.  The trust fund may receive payments from its beneficiary SMEs in the form of principal \nrepayments and interest. In addition, it may receive income from the partial cost recovery for \nbusiness advisory services provided under mandate letters. \n \n36.  The Government of Australia has committed A$15,000,000 in grant resources to the \ntrust fund.32 Additional grant contributions from bilateral, multilateral, and other sources may be \naccepted, substantially following the terms and conditions in this paper and the implementation \nguidelines.  \n \n                                                 \n29  Section VI. Use and Flow of Funds in the Trust Fund Implementation Guidelines (Supplementary Appendix A). \n30 Administrative expenses include service charges, cost of external audits, and finance charges that may be incurred \nin purchasing required currencies and in remitting funds. \n31 Resources may be used for TA, investments, or direct charge, as described in the implementation guidelines \n(para. 69). Direct charges may include, but not be limited to, consultant services and related expenses. ADB\u2019s \nController\u2019s Department, conditional upon the independent finance committee\u2019s approval, and upon the request of \nthe Director General of PARD, will disburse concessional loans to SMEs. \n32 The initial allocation for concessional loans through the trust fund will be the balance from the Government of \nAustralia\u2019s contribution less the $11,000,000 allocated to the TA, and is estimated at $3,000,000. \n ", "10 \nVII.  TRUST FUND ADMINISTRATION ARRANGEMENTS \n37.  ADB will assert the privileges and immunities accorded to ADB under the Agreement \nEstablishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter)33 with respect to all the trust fund\u2019s \nproperty, assets, income, and operations. \n \n38.  ADB will hold and administer contributions separately from its own resources and from \nother  ADB-administered  trust  fund  resources.  As  a  multi-partner  fund,  the  trust  fund  will \ncomingle all available funds in the trust fund account. Following its standard procedures, ADB \nwill maintain records and accounts that identify the contributions made and the commitments to \nbe financed out of the available funds, including eligible activities and administrative expenses. \nADB will provide financing partners with special purpose financial statements of the account \naudited annually by ADB\u2019s external auditors within 6 months after the financial year end. The \ncost of these audits will be charged to the trust fund. \n \n39.  Funds for providing concessional loans to SMEs will be accepted and administered \nunder documentation that details each party\u2019s understandings, risks, and obligations. ADB will \nhave no liability to the financing partners for the nonpayment of principal or other amounts, or \nfor other nonperformance by the recipient of the concessional loan, nor for partial or complete \nloss  of  contributions  to  the  trust  fund.  ADB  and  its  officers,  employees  or  agents,  and \nconsultants will be indemnified out of trust fund property against any loss, liability, cost, claim, \naction, or demand that any indemnified party may incur or which may be made against any of \nthem arising out of or in connection with the trust fund\u2019s activities, except as may result from \nADB\u2019s gross negligence or willful misconduct. \n \n40.  Following its standard procedures, ADB will charge a service fee to cover its incremental \ncost in administering, managing, supervising, and operating the trust fund. The service charge \nwill be paid from available funds at the time of eligible disbursements from the trust fund.34 \n \n41.  ADB will submit annual progress reports to the financing partners on the trust fund\u2019s \nperformance.  ADB  will  also  provide  financing  partners  with  reports  and  information,  as \nappropriate, on the progress of activities under the trust fund. Financing partners and ADB will \nmeet at least once a year after the establishment of the trust fund to provide strategic guidance, \nreview progress, and assess performance. \n \n42.  ADB will promptly inform the financing partners of any condition that interferes with, or \nthreatens to interfere with, ADB\u2019s administration of the trust fund. \n \n43.  From time to time, ADB may adopt additional rules for administering the trust fund that \nare  substantially  based  on  this  paper\u2019s  terms  and  conditions,  and will  inform all  financing \npartners accordingly.  \n \n44.  The financing partners and ADB will agree upon any changes in the implementation \narrangements for grant contributions to the trust fund, including the implementation guidelines. \nChanges will be approved by the Director General of PARD. \n \n                                                 \n33  ADB. 1965.

Manila. \n34 The service charge is 5% of the amounts disbursed for the TA, in accordance with ADB\u2019s fee structure, as \namended from time to time. The service charge is also 5% of the amounts disbursed for concessional loans. ", "11 \n45.  Any proposal to administer non-grant contributions to the trust fund and any changes to \nthe objective, scope, and implementation arrangements to the trust fund resulting therefrom will \nbe submitted for approval to ADB\u2019s Board of Directors.  \n \n46.  A midterm evaluation of the trust fund and the TA will be carried out after the second \nyear to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the organizational setup. An independent \nevaluation of the trust fund and the TA will be carried out in the fourth year to assess results. \nThe evaluation will inform the trust fund\u2019s future after the fifth year, which may include (i) \ncontinuation of the trust fund with ADB as its trustee, (ii) termination and winding up of the trust \nfund, and (iii) transfer of the fund\u2019s assets into a newly created fund and appointment of a new \ntrustee qualified to perform its roles and to manage the assets. \n \n47.  Unless otherwise agreed by the financing partners and ADB, the trust fund will terminate \non such date declared by ADB that ADB has substantially disbursed the contributions and all \nconcessional loans provided to SMEs from the trust fund have been liquidated. At such time, \nexcept for actions necessary for the orderly and expeditious winding up of the trust fund\u2019s \nactivities, ADB\u2019s functions in relation to the contributions will be considered terminated. \n \n48.  Unless otherwise agreed with the financing partners, upon termination of the trust fund \nand subsequent liquidation of the account, any available funds will be returned to the individual \nfinancing partners, in proportion to their respective available contributions. Following trust fund \ntermination, ADB will provide financing partners and the Board with a final report on the projects \nand activities supported. \n \n49.  ADB will discharge its function as trustee with care and due diligence, and will have no \nfurther liability in respect of the contributions provided by financing partners. \n \nVIII.  RISK AND MITIGATION MEASURES \n50.  Most trust fund activities will focus on business advisory services to assist SMEs in \nraising  finance  on  commercial  terms  from  financial  institutions  in  the  region.  Where \nconcessional loans are provided, the evaluation of risk is a key task performed by the finance-\nstructuring consultant and finance committee during due diligence, and approval of the provision \nof a concessional loan through the trust fund. Concessional loans provided from the trust fund \nwill carry a relatively high repayment risk. In addition, the trustee and financing partners face \nreputational risks as well as safeguard risks.35 The major risks and mitigating measures are \nsummarized in the table. \n \nSummary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nTrustee and/or financing partner  Funds for providing concessional loans to small and medium-sized \nreputations affected by failed investments  enterprises (SMEs) will be accepted and administered under \ndocumentation that details each party\u2019s understandings, risks, and \nobligations. \nPoor quality business advice provided by  The individual business advisors will be selected on the strength of \nbusiness advisor  their previous performance and reputation.
