THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  for  the  additional  financing  of  the  Horticulture  Value  Chain \nDevelopment Project.1 \n \n2.   The proposed additional financing will help the Government of Uzbekistan to scale up the \nexisting project\u2019s support to horticulture value chain development in all 12 regions nationwide and \nin the Republic of Karakalpakstan. It will increase the outreach of participating financial institutions \n(PFIs) and improve access to market-based bank finance for horticulture enterprises (farmers, \nagro-processing enterprises, owners and operators of cold storage facilities, and trading and \nlogistics service suppliers). These will include both additional enterprises not financed under the \nexisting project and enterprises already financed under the existing project to enable them to \nexpand operations. The additional financing will enhance the impact of the existing project and \nfurther increase farm productivity, improve processing and storage capacity, and reduce post-\nharvest losses through upgrading and establishing intensive orchards; modern and efficient \ngreenhouses; and processing, storage, and refrigeration facilities. This will, in turn, promote long-\nterm  economic  and  environmental  sustainability,  and  enhance  profitability  for  farmers  and \nagribusiness enterprises. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Sector performance. Uzbekistan\u2019s economy grew consistently during 2010\u20132016, when \ngross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average annual rate of 8.0%, reaching $63.4 billion in \n2016.2 The economy has proved resilient to the downward pressures exerted from 2008 onwards \non other economies by the global financial crisis. Despite an economic downturn in the Russian \nFederation (Uzbekistan\u2019s major trading partner and source of remittances), the Uzbek economy \nachieved GDP growth rates of 7.8% in 2016 and 5.3% in 2017. GDP growth is expected to be \n7.3% in 2018.3 According to national poverty line estimates, overall poverty declined from 27.5% \nof the population in 2001 to 12.8% in 2016 as a result of rapid economic growth.4 Along with \noverall economic growth, agriculture GDP in Uzbekistan grew at an average annual rate of 6.7% \nduring 2012\u20132016. There was however, a slowdown in 2017 when the sector grew by only 2.0%. \nThe higher rate of growth in other sectors resulted in a decline in the agriculture sector\u2019s \ncontribution to GDP, from 34.4% in 2000 to 19.2% in 2017. Agriculture\u2019s contribution to GDP has \ntraditionally derived from the production of cotton and wheat, which the government has regarded \nas strategic crops and supported through preferential access to land, inputs, and finance. \nHowever, there has been a shift in the contribution of these crops to GDP since 2000. The share \nof cotton production in GDP declined from 3.6% in 2000 to 2.3% in 2016. Over the same period, \nthe contribution of grains to GDP fell from 3.4% to 2.4%, while the combined share of fruit and \nvegetables increased from 5.2% to 10.6%.5 \n \n4.  Despite its declining share of GDP, agriculture remains an important sector. In 2017, it \naccounted for 27% of total employment. It is also a key income source in rural areas, where 49% \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  World Bank estimate in dollars. http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/uzbekistan (accessed 1 January 2018). \n3  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2017. Asian Development Outlook 2017. Manila. \n4  On the basis of $1.90 purchasing power parity criterion, an estimated 68.1% of the population was below the poverty \nline in 2012. ADB. 2017.

Tashkent. \n ", "2 \n \nof the population resides, and which account for 75% of people living below the poverty line. About \n4.7 million rural households operating dehkan (small-scale) farms derive their income from \nagriculture. Dehkan farms, which operate independently of government support, account for the \nproduction of 66% of vegetables, 76% of potatoes, 54% of fruit, and 49% of grapes on farms of \n0.35\u20130.50 hectares (ha). \n \n5.  The shift in production from cotton and wheat to horticulture is also reflected in exports. \nAgricultural exports grew at an annual average rate (in current dollar terms) of 12.5% during \n2000\u20132013, while cotton exports grew by an annual rate of only 2.0%. During 2010\u20132017, cotton \nexports declined from $1.5 billion to $477.1 million, while the share of cotton exports in total \nexports fell from 27.5% in 2000 to 3.4% in 2017. By comparison, the share of food products in \nexports rose from 5.00% in 2000 to 6.35% in 2017.6 Fruit and vegetable exports grew from $68.7 \nmillion in 2000 to $1.45 billion in 2016, equating to an average annual growth rate of 21%, while \nthe share of fruit and vegetables in total exports increased from 2% to 9%. In 2016, the value of \nfruit and vegetable exports exceeded that of cotton exports by more than 30% ($600 million). \n \n6.  Binding constraints. Although it is expected to continue to grow, the agriculture sector \nis characterized by low productivity and remains labor intensive. The horticulture subsector is \nconstrained by limited access to quality land, specialized horticulture machinery, appropriate \ninputs, and, in particular, finance. Limited access to either equity or long-term debt financing for \nproducers and enterprises throughout the value chain constrains development. The horticulture \nsubsector does not receive preferential financing under government programs, as is the case for \ncotton and wheat production. Financial institutions have a largely negative perception of the \nprofitability  and  creditworthiness  of  the  agriculture  sector,  exacerbated  by  an  undeveloped \nregulatory framework for the use of movable assets as loan collateral, and a lack of acceptable \ncollateral among many small-scale producers or collateral with low realizable values among \nagribusiness enterprises. Further, access to information on potential borrowers is limited as the \ncredit information system is not efficient. Financial institutions have yet to develop credit policies \nand loan products appropriate to the needs of horticulture producers and enterprises, including \ncash-flow-based loan appraisal suitable for horticulture investment and seasonality of production. \n \n7.  The high cost of funds, perceived risks, and administrative costs associated with lending \nto individuals and small businesses require banks to charge interest rates of 11%\u201325% for local \ncurrency loans and 6%\u201315% for foreign currency loans. Individuals and small businesses are \ngenerally  required  to  borrow  at  the  higher  end  of  these  ranges.7 Deposit  mobilization  is \nundermined  by  public  mistrust  in  banks  and  is  compounded  by  administrative  hurdles  in \nwithdrawing cash from bank accounts. Bank loans are mainly short-term, with an average maturity \nof 18 months. While there is a high demand for medium- and long-term loans, banks are not able \nto finance due to their lack of equivalent medium- and long-term funding sources. Moreover, \naccess to finance for private individuals and enterprises is constrained by weak rural branch \nnetworks and limited mobile banking services. Family, friends, and informal sources fund 80% of \nsmall businesses.8 In addition, farmers and agribusiness enterprises have poorly developed \nbusiness and managerial skills and generally low financial literacy.  \n \n                                                \n6  Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, Investment, and Trade. http://www.mfer.uz (accessed 1 January 2018). \n7  Under the existing project, PFIs receive ADB loan funds via the Ministry of Finance at 3%. To this PFIs add 2.5\u20133.5 \npercentage points based on their normal credit and risk management policies. \n8  World Bank. 2014. Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey, 2012\u20132014. Washington, DC. \n ", "3 \n8.  Opportunities. The potential of a growing and more sophisticated consumer demand for \nboth fresh and processed products in domestic and export markets is not being realized because \nof such constraints. Significantly larger volumes of produce with improved quality could be \nmarketed if better post-harvest logistics, notably cold storage and transport, existed.9 Of the 20 \nmillion tons of horticultural output in 2016, only 15% was processed. Of the 3 million tons of fruit \nproduced, 69% are consumed fresh, 20% are processed, and 11% are exported, while for the 10 \nmillion tons of vegetables,  81.0% are consumed fresh, 11.3% are processed, 4.3%  are used for \nseeds, and 3.4%  are exported. This indicates a significant opportunity for improved value addition \nfrom increased processing and exports of both fresh and processed products. The revealed \ncomparative  advantage  analysis  by  ADB  staff  suggests  that  Uzbekistan  produces  more \nspecialized  horticultural  products than  many  other  countries,  indicating  potential to  expand \nexports. \n \n9.  Continued diversification from cotton and wheat production toward horticulture also offers \nsignificant environmental benefits as it could decrease demand for irrigation water. Climate \nchange projections for Uzbekistan from 2005 to 2050 indicate that (i) water supply will decrease \nfrom 57 billion cubic meters (m3) to 52\u201354 billion m3, (ii) water demand will increase from 59 billion \nm3 to 62\u201363 billion m3, and (iii) the water deficit will increase by more than 500% from about 2 \nbillion m3 to 11\u201313 billion m3.10 Horticulture crops typically use less water than cotton and are \nmore efficient in water use than grain crops. In Uzbekistan, 4,426 m3 of water is required to grow \n1 ton of cotton and 2,068 m3 of water is required for 1 ton of wheat.11 By comparison, grape \nproduction per ton requires about 2,400 m3 of water and apples 820 m3. Diversification of fruit and \nvegetable production from field to greenhouse cultivation, which is specifically supported under \nthe project, also offers significant water use efficiency and environmental management benefits. \n \n10.  Government\u2019s sector strategy. The government aims to take more steps to increase \nagriculture  production.12 Measures  include  (i)  further  structural  reforms  in  agriculture  and \ndiversification  of  agricultural  production;  (ii)  mechanization  of  agriculture,  improvement  of \ninfrastructure, and development of agribusiness; (iii) more productive use of land and water; (iv) \ngreater financial stability of farm entities; and (v) more market-oriented agricultural policies. The \ngovernment\u2019s sector development plan up to 2020 includes further reductions in cotton and wheat \nproduction and an increase in horticulture production. The strategy for further land reallocation \nwill result in the following production area increases: 36,000 ha for potatoes, 91,000 ha for \nvegetables, 18,000 ha for fruit orchards, and 11,200 ha for vineyards.13 The strategy will also aim \nat  improving  logistics  and  processing  to  boost  exports  of  agricultural  products,  including \nhorticulture.14  \n \n11.  In  the finance  sector, the  government  has  implemented  programs to  support  small \nbusinesses and banking industry growth, and has increased access to finance. To improve the \n                                                \n9  Staff estimates indicate that post-harvest losses are up to 45.0% of the harvested crop, and that existing cold storage \nwill only be able to store 2.3% of the total forecast horticulture output by 2020. \n10 World Bank. 2010.

To facilitate registration of movable \nassets  as  loan  collateral,  the  2013  Law  on  Collateral  Registry  supports  establishing  an \nelectronically secured transactions registry. Laws enacted in the late 1990s need to be improved \nto facilitate the use of movable property as collateral. Assisted by the International Finance \nCorporation, the government prepared draft legal amendments for enactment in 2017. The \ngovernment\u2019s development strategy is consistent with the country partnership strategy, 2012\u2013\n2016 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for Uzbekistan and is included in ADB\u2019s country \noperations business plan, 2016\u20132018.15 \n \n12.  Development partners have supported agriculture and horticulture through a variety of \nprojects  and  technical  assistance.  The  World  Bank  has  implemented  two  rural  enterprise \nrestructuring  projects  that  included  the  provision  of  credit  to  farmers  and  food  processing \nenterprises. The World Bank is also implementing a horticulture development project with total \nfinancing of $650 million (including $500 million additional financing approved in January 2018).16 \nThis project includes (i) providing credit lines to PFIs, (ii) improving financial literacy and business \nplanning skills for horticulture farmers and agribusiness enterprises, (iii) establishing a national \nnetwork of private growers through training and technical assistance, and (iv) strengthening state \nresearch  institutes  and  plant  protection  services.  The  International  Fund  for  Agricultural \nDevelopment (IFAD) is implementing a $30 million horticulture development project.17 Other \ndevelopment partners have also provided broad support to enhance the business environment \nand  capacity  building  for  financial  institutions  and  small  businesses.18 Despite  the  recent \ninjections of long-term finance (estimated at $0.9 billion) in horticulture through these World Bank \nand IFAD projects and ADB\u2019s ongoing project, there remains significant unmet demand for long-\nterm finance in the horticulture subsector. The Rural Restructuring Agency (RRA), which is \nimplementing these projects, estimates the demand for additional investment finance during \n2018\u20132022 to be in the range of $0.8 billion\u2013$1.0 billion. \n \n13.  Assessment of the existing project. The existing project was approved in November \n2016 and became effective in April 2017. Overall, implementation progress is rated highly \nsatisfactory. As of February 2018, cumulative fund release was $151.7 million, accounting for \n98.5% of total loan proceeds ($154.0 million). A total of $151.4 million has been released to PFIs \nfor subloan financing, of which $130.2 million has been disbursed by PFIs to subborrowers. The \nremaining $21.2 million has also been committed to eligible subprojects. Cumulative liquidated \nsubloans amount to $82.1 million, accounting for 63% of total loan proceeds versus 22% of project \nimplementation time elapsed. The project has supported 124 horticulture subprojects through \nsubloans. Fifty-four of the subprojects financed to date, with a subloan value of $66.4 million, \nhave been for production, and 70 subprojects, with a subloan value of $63.8 million, have been \nfor post-harvest storage and processing. The project has helped (i) establish 2,753 ha of intensive \norchards and 109 ha of water- and energy-saving greenhouses, (ii) increase the refrigerated \nstorage capacity by 39,150 tons and post-harvest processing capacity by 7,224 tons, (iii) establish \npackaging material manufacture of 12 million square meters, and (iv) procure 171 units of \nagricultural machinery. Given the nature of subprojects financed, in both production and modern \npost-harvest facilities, the project will have a positive effect on the production, marketing, branding, \nand export of Uzbek horticultural produce.19 \n                                                \n15 ADB. 2012.

", "5 \n \n14.  Compliance with safeguard policy requirements has been rated satisfactory. All PFIs have \nbeen implementing environmental and social management systems (ESMSs) and will be required \nto further strengthen their ESMS and staff capacity during the remaining project implementation \nperiod. Risk management arrangements are satisfactory. PFIs have assigned staff to the existing \nproject who are able to effectively appraise subloan financing, subproject safeguards, and social \nand gender development aspects. Other than in certain limited cases, all PFIs are compliant with \nCentral Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) prudential regulations and ADB loan covenants. Subproject \nrisks are further mitigated by screening of PFIs\u2019 advance requests, demand projections, and \nindividual subloan applications by the RRA, which is well staffed and is capable of undertaking \nsubproject appraisal and monitoring functions. The project performance rating is on track since \nApril 2017, when the project became effective. \n \n15.  The rapid disbursement of existing project funds reflects the high level of demand within \nthe horticulture subsector for long-term finance. PFIs and the RRA estimate that demand exists \nfor financing of a further $1 billion. The scaling up of the existing project through additional \nfinancing rather than a separate stand-alone project represents the most effective and fastest way \nto meet such demand. The PFIs engaged in the existing project will also participate in the \nproposed additional financing project. These PFIs have well-established systems and procedures \nfor subloan identification, appraisal, disbursement, and monitoring. The PFIs concerned also \ncontinue to satisfy ADB\u2019s financial intermediary eligibility criteria, and the existing project meets \nADB\u2019s criteria for additional financing.20 \n \n16.  ADB\u2019s  value  addition  and  lessons.  The  project  will  help  enhance  private  sector \nparticipation in the agriculture value chains to increase efficiency gains while reducing the fiscal \nburden on the state. Moreover, through enhanced access to long-term finance, PFIs will be able \nto  sustainably  increase  their  outreach  into  horticultural  business  as  a  high-potential  niche. \nExpanded export of horticultural produce will help increase overall price and income transmission \nto small-scale producers and small and medium-sized agribusinesses. Capacity development \nactivities  under  the  existing  project  will  enhance  subborrowers\u2019  technical  capacity  for  their \nproposed investments. Implementation results of the existing project suggest that the success of \nprojects of a similar nature lies in PFIs proactively identifying a diverse potential clientele (or \nsubborrowers) with financing demand for export-oriented horticulture value chain activities. Seven \nqualified PFIs have undertaken an inventory of potential clientele, the preliminary demand \nestimates of which indicate that the proposed additional financing loan of $198 million can be fully \nutilized by December 2021.21 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n17.  The impact and outcome for the overall project will be the same as for the existing project. \nThe overall project is aligned with the following impact: improved contribution of the horticulture \nsubsector to inclusive economic growth and rural employment (footnote 12). The overall project \nwill have the following outcome: increased production and marketing of horticultural products, \nwhich also remains unchanged from the existing project. \n   \n                                                \n20 ADB. 2011.

Subloan \nrepayment may be in dollars and/or local currency subject to the subborrowers\u2019 demand and \nsubprojects\u2019 revenue streams, as well as specific agreements between PFIs and subborrowers. \nSubloans extended by PFIs will have a tenor of up to 10 years. PFIs will revolve subloan \nrepayments to finance additional subloans during the 20-year tenor of loans received from the \ngovernment. PFIs will determine the creditworthiness of subborrowers and assume the full credit \nrisk. The maximum subloan size will be $5 million based on demand of PFIs\u2019 clientele. \n \n23.  Participating financial institutions. Seven of eight PFIs implementing the existing \nproject expressed their interest to participate in the project. They are Asaka Bank, Davr Bank, \nIpak Yuli Bank, Ipoteka Bank, National Bank of Uzbekistan, Turon Bank, and Uzpromstroybank. \nThese PFIs underwent comprehensive due diligence by ADB, and for the most part comply with \nCBU prudential regulations and meet ADB\u2019s eligibility requirements for financial intermediaries \nand ADB-determined financial covenants.27 Areas of marginal noncompliance improvements and \naction plans for PFIs to ensure compliance with CBU regulations and ADB financial covenants \nare indicated in the PAM. 28 \n \nE.

As part of the ongoing \nreforms, the ministry was divided into the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Water Resources in February \n2018. The government issued a decree on 17 April 2018, which decides, among other things, to reorganize the RRA. \nSpecifically, effective from 1 July 2018, the RRA and Center for Implementation of Investment Projects in Agriculture \nand Water Sectors will be merged to form the \u201cAgency for Implementation of Projects in Agro-Industrial and Food \nSectors\u201d. The newly-established agency will be under the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan. The \ndecree also states that the new agency will be the legal successor of the RRA and the Center for Implementation of \nInvestment Projects in Agriculture and Water Sectors on their rights, obligations and contracts.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n25.  Based  on  portfolio  analysis  and  loan  utilization  of  PFIs  under  the  existing  project, \nsubborrowers have procured equipment with associated works and services from the Russian \nFederation and Iran because of the suitability of technologies and reasonably low costs. It is \nenvisaged that potential subborrowers of PFI subloans will procure goods, works, and consulting \nservices from both member and nonmember countries of ADB. A request to ADB\u2019s Board of \nDirectors is being made, pursuant to Article 14(ix) of the Agreement Establishing the Asian \nDevelopment Bank, to approve procurement of goods, works, and consulting services from non-\nADB member countries by subborrowers using loan proceeds under the project in appropriate \ncircumstances.29 This request reflects the market-based nature of the project, subborrowers\u2019 \ndemand, and procurement history. The Board of Directors must approve the waiver by a vote \nrepresenting not less than two-thirds of the total voting power of the members of the Board. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n26.  The proposed project will help improve horticulture subsector productivity and value \naddition in line with the government strategy. By addressing the horticulture subsector constraint \nof accessing long-term finance, the proposed project will facilitate and spur investment in intensive \nenergy- and water-efficient technologies for fruit and vegetable production and post-harvest \nstorage, processing, and marketing facilities. This will increase the volume and enhance the \n                                                \n29 ADB. 1966. Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank. Manila. ", "9 \nquality of Uzbek horticulture produce for both domestic and export markets. All subprojects, \nsubborrowers, and subloans to be financed under the proposed project will be required to meet \ntechnical and financial eligibility criteria established under the existing project as defined in the \nPAM. Analysis of a sample of representative production and agribusiness investments financed \nby the existing project indicates that such investments are both financially and economically \nviable.30 \n \n27.  The seven proposed PFIs satisfy ADB\u2019s financial intermediary criteria and eligibility criteria \nestablished under the existing project as defined in the PAM, and have experience in lending to \nthe agriculture sector, with varying levels of agricultural loan portfolios. They have all been \nassessed as financially sound. Financial projections for the project implementation period indicate \nthe PFIs will continue to perform well and comply with CBU regulations and loan financial \ncovenants. The maximum value of project-financed subloans is projected to range from 0.2% to \n2.0% of PFIs\u2019 gross loan portfolios during project implementation in 2018\u20132021. Borrowing under \nthe proposed project is, therefore, well within the absorptive capacity of each PFI.31 \n \nB.  Governance \n \n28.  Financial and integrity due diligence has been undertaken on each PFI. The overall \npremitigation financial management risk is classified moderate. An action plan for each PFI to \naddress financial management issues has been prepared and will be implemented up to the \nsecond quarter of 2019. A financial management assessment of the RRA did not identify any \nissues that would adversely affect its project management role. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, \nas amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government, the RRA, and PFIs. \nThe specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n29.  The existing project supports poverty reduction indirectly through horticulture value chain \ndevelopment. With 32% of the total workforce in agriculture, the proposed project will help many \nhorticulture farmers and entrepreneurs boost their investments, maintain and expand employment, \nand provide stable incomes for themselves and their employees and suppliers. The proposed \nproject is classified as \u201ceffective gender mainstreaming.\u201d Gender actions will help enhance female \nentrepreneurship in the horticulture subsector.32 ADB conducted due diligence and confirmed that \ncore labor standards were complied with within the horticulture subsector. The loan and project \nagreements include covenants on labor standards and safety. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n30.  The project is classified as \u201cfinancial intermediation\u201d for environment and category C for \ninvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples\u2019 safeguards. Subprojects that are identified in \nADB\u2019s  Prohibited  Investment  Activities  List  in  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009), \nclassified category A for environment, and classified category A or B for involuntary resettlement \nor indigenous peoples\u2019 safeguards are not eligible for project financing. In addition, eligible \nsubprojects will comply with all applicable national regulations. ADB carried out due diligence on \nPFIs\u2019 implementation of ESMSs. All PFIs have been implementing ESMSs under the existing \nproject in accordance with the requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n                                                \n30 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32  Subprojects financed by the existing project have reportedly employed over 20% female workers.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n32.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, \nprocurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM and loan \ndocuments. \n \n33.  The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set \nforth in the loan and project agreements. As a condition for loan disbursement for relending to a \nPFI, the government and the RRA shall enter into a tripartite subsidiary loan agreement with each \nPFI, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATIONS \n \n34.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$198,000,000 to the Republic of Uzbekistan for the additional financing of the Horticulture Value \nChain Development Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in concessional terms, with \nan interest charge at the rate of 2.0% per year during the grace period and thereafter; for a term \nof 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project agreements presented \nto the Board. \n \n35.
