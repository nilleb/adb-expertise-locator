INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested technical assistance \n(TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support improvements to the design of its \nnational carbon emissions trading system (ETS). Together with other policies, the national ETS \nis expected to operate as a cost-effective market mechanism to support the achievement of the \nPRC\u2019s climate change mitigation targets. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business \nplan, 2018\u20132020 for the PRC.1 \n \n2.  The knowledge and support TA will aid the PRC\u2019s Ministry of Ecology and Environment in \nformulating responsive carbon pricing measures and prudent market oversight measures, which \nwill help the national ETS function effectively and efficiently.2 The TA will develop three policy \nrecommendations for consideration by the government on (i) auctioning of greenhouse gas (GHG) \nemission allowance;3 (ii) GHG emission credit management, such as banking; and (iii) ETS \nmarket risk identification and management. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  On  30  June  2015,  the  government  submitted  its  intended  nationally  determined \ncontribution  to  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC), \npromising to achieve peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 or sooner and to lower carbon \ndioxide emissions per unit of gross domestic product by 60%\u201365% from 2005 levels.4 The PRC \nestimates that the country will hit peak emissions when its per capita gross domestic product is \nabout 33% lower than the average of countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation \nand Development; its per capita emission level is forecast to be about 30% smaller than the \naverage of those countries.5 An effective ETS to help reduce GHG mitigation costs and provide \nincentives to balance economic growth and climate change mitigation cost-effectively will be \ncrucial  for  the  PRC  to  meet  its  commitment.  In  all  jurisdictions  where  an  ETS  has  been \nimplemented, ETS policies and measures such as carbon pricing and market oversight measures \nare at the core of ETS governance to ensure a safe and efficient trading environment, enhance \nmarket confidence, and reduce the overall cost of meeting ETS mitigation targets. \n \n4.  The PRC began testing ETSs through pilot programs in the municipalities of Beijing, \nChongqing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Tianjin; and in the provinces of Guangdong and Hubei in \nOctober 2011.6 ADB approved three TA projects to support ETS development in the PRC during \nthe ETS pilot period, focusing on the basic design of an ETS at a pilot city or province.7 The first \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2018.

The TA first \nappeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 17 August 2018. \n2  The PRC\u2019s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) proposed the TA. In March 2018, the first \nsession of the 13th National People\u2019s Congress of the People\u2019s Republic of China decided to shift climate change \nmanagement from the NDRC to the new Ministry of Ecology and Environment. \n3  In an ETS, the government imposes a limit on the total emissions in one or more sectors of the economy. Companies \nin these sectors need to hold one allowance (or permit) for every ton of GHG emissions they release. There are two \napproaches to allocating permits: free allocation (based on past emissions or performance standards) or sold at an \nauction at a competitive public price. \n4  United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. 2015.

Technical Assistance to the \n ", "2 \nTA  supported  Beijing  in  enhancing  the  capacity  of  the  Beijing  Environment  Exchange  by \ndeveloping a road map for the establishment of a carbon finance center. The second TA \nsupported Tianjin in developing a trading system, including trading rules and regulations, trading \nplatform installation, and ETS registry setting. The third TA supported Shanghai in developing \ntrading products and methods of sector benchmarks in GHG emission allocation. All pilot ETSs \ndeveloped and implemented ETS rules and policies that covered aspects such as offsetting rules \nand market adjustment. For example, the Beijing pilot ETS issued rules on the use of emission-\nreduction credits to offset part of the emissions of the covered entities and on open market \noperations to ensure market stability and avoid price fluctuations.8 However, the pilot ETS rules \nand policies have been ineffective because many factors affecting ETS operations were not \naddressed appropriately. One example is the unscheduled revision to the offsetting rules and \nallowance banking rules in the Shanghai pilot ETS in response to the abundant use of offsetting \ncredits and rapid plummeting of the allowance price.9 \n \n5.  The European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), which has been operating \nsince 2005, initially experienced stolen credits and high price volatility, which led the European \nUnion to strengthen ETS market oversight by (i) applying rules governing financial markets to all \nsegments of the ETS, (ii) establishing the market stability reserve, and (iii) limiting the use of \nemission-reduction credits generated from clean development mechanism projects. All other \nETSs, including the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), the New Zealand ETS, and the \nCalifornia ETS, experienced an oversupply of GHG emission allowances and thus lower carbon \ntrading prices, which made them reform and improve their ETS oversight system by introducing \nand refining the policies and measures to manage the supply of allowances and adjust market \nprices based on market conditions. These policies and measures helped avoid an oversupply of \nallowances and prevent price increases, thus keeping carbon prices at reasonable levels. For \nexample, the RGGI adopted a flexibility reserve similar to the EU ETS in order to adjust the supply \nand its impact on carbon prices. Floor and cap prices are commonly used to manage carbon \nprices in the California, Qu\u00e9bec, and RGGI systems.10 These experiences and lessons can be \nuseful references for the PRC in developing its ETS policies and measures. \n \n6.  On 19 December 2017, the National Development and Reform Commission launched the \nPRC\u2019s national ETS through the Development Plan for National Carbon Emission Trading Market \n(Power Generation Sector) that was endorsed by the State Council, which laid out the national \nETS development and operation plan.11 Based on the development plan, Local governments \nfollowing the guidance of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment are expected to assign GHG \nemission permits to power generation entities covered by the ETS in 2018, and trial permit trading \nwill start in 2019. The national ETS will operate normally by 2020 and will gradually expand to \nreach other sectors. \n                                                \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for Advancing Shanghai Carbon Market through Emissions Trading Scheme.

The PRC\u2019s national ETS is expected to be the biggest carbon market in the world with an \nannual emission volume exceeding 3 billion metric tons, dwarfing the EU ETS volume of about \n1.8 billion metric tons in 2016.12 This will make the PRC\u2019s national ETS one of the most influential \nin the world, and its effective operation will be vital to the success of global climate change \ncampaign. Given the short history and complexity of the ETS, the government is careful in the \nnational  system  design.  The  development  plan  stated  that  effective  and  strict  oversight \nmechanisms involving all relevant authorities should be established. To support ETS operations, \nthe government needs to formulate effective and efficient policies and measures in market \noversight and market price management to address market volatility and any unintended adverse \nimpacts such as market manipulation and other market misconduct. However, the development \nplan is only a framework, and ETS operational policies and measures\u2014such as GHG emission \nallowance auctions, trading credit banking, and ETS market risk management\u2014have not been \ndeveloped yet. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: the PRC\u2019s national ETS functioning and \noperational.13 The TA will have the following outcome: national ETS policies on allowance \nmanagement and market oversight improved.14 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  The PRC\u2019s national ETS is more complex than the local pilot ETSs. The PRC needs to \ndevelop customized policies and measures to support the effective and efficient operations of the \nnational ETS. The TA will provide vital inputs for developing policies, measures, and guidelines \nto strengthen the national ETS operation based on (i) the experience and lessons learned from \nthe pilot ETSs, including the findings from the three ADB-assisted TA projects; and (ii) the lessons \nlearned by other carbon markets, such as the EU ETS, the RGGI, the Qu\u00e9bec\u2013California\u2013Ontario \nCarbon Market, and the New Zealand ETS. It also takes into account the special circumstances \nfacing the PRC\u2019s national ETS. The TA will deliver the following outputs: \n(i)  Output 1: Policy recommendations on allowance management and market \noversight measures of the national emissions trading system developed. \nBased on the analysis of the factors influencing carbon market operations in the \nPRC and the experiences and lessons learned by the PRC pilot ETSs and the \ncarbon  markets  in  other  countries,  the  TA  team  will  draft  policy \nrecommendations on allowance management and market oversight measures \nof the PRC\u2019s national ETS. This output will have three parts: \n(a)  Policy recommendation on allowance auction developed. The TA \nteam will develop a recommendation based on a review and assessment \nof available experience and lessons of allowance auction practices, and \na study on the relationship between allowance prices and marginal \nabatement costs. The recommendation will include an implementation \nplan and a manual of management processes and procedures to help \n                                                \n12 National Energy Administration. 2017.

It  will  also  cover  institutional  and  governance \narrangements and how parties would carry out their responsibilities. \n(b)  Policy  recommendation  on  managing  allowance  and  offsetting \ncredits developed. The TA team will develop a policy recommendation \nbased on research and analysis of different existing regulations related \nto the allowance and offsetting credit validity period, different banking \nlengths, the impact on market practitioners\u2019 trading behavior, and market \nrisks.15 \n(c)  Recommendation on market oversight measures of the national \nemissions  trading  system  operation  developed.  The \nrecommendation will cover the objectives, scope, principles, roles and \nresponsibilities,  and  general  requirements  of  market  oversight  to \nmanage the ETS operation system effectively (including GHG emission \nmonitoring, reporting, and verification) and to minimize the impacts of \npotential market risks. It is expected to help in the early identification and \nassessment of market risks. Coordinating relevant policies, such as \nEnergy  Savings  Trade  and  Green  Electricity  Certificate  Trading,  is \nneeded for the national ETS to be effective. Hence, the recommendation \nwill also address the impact of the policies of different agencies that may \naffect the ETS\u2019s effective operations. Finally, this output will recommend \nthe applicable state-of-art technologies including blockchain technology \nas  a  pilot  innovative  measure  of  ETS  market  oversight,  for  the \nconsideration by the government. \n(ii)  Output 2: National capacity in emissions trading system management \nenhanced. The TA will support the executing agency in organizing two training \nworkshops  for  local  government  officials  and  experts  in  ETS  operational \nmanagement. The training workshops will introduce the findings of this TA, \ninternational best practice in ETS, updated UNFCCC decisions on carbon \nmarkets, and national ETS policies and measures. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The TA is estimated to cost $900,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Climate Change Fund.16 The key expenditure items are in Appendix 2. \n \n11.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of staff time, office space and \nsupplies, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  The Transport and Communications Division of ADB\u2019s East Asia Department will select, \nsupervise, and evaluate consultants; organize training programs, seminars, workshops, and/or \nforums; and administer all other business of the TA. It will work closely with the Department of \nClimate Change of the PRC\u2019s Ministry of Ecology and Environment, the executing agency of this \nTA. The implementation arrangement is summarized in the table. \n \n                                                \n15 Compliance flexibility can be enhanced by the option of saving credits/allowances to future periods (banking).  \nThis option enhances cost-effectiveness and foster carbon price stability. In addition, banking provides incentives for \nearly action, but also involves increasing risks of over-allocation of allowances/credits in subsequent periods. \n16 Established by ADB. \n ", "5 \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  October 2018\u2013September 2020 \nExecuting agency  Department of Climate Change, Ministry of Ecology and \nEnvironment, People\u2019s Republic of China \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nIndividual selection  International expertise   $240,000 \n(12 person-months) \nIndividual selection  National expertise   $220,000 \n(44 person-months) \nDisbursement  The technical assistance resources will be disbursed following \nADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time).  \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n13.
