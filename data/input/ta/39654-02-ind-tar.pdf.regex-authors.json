This  Board  information  paper  (BIP)  reports  on  the  implementation  progress  of  the \ntechnical assistance cluster (TAC), TAC 4814-IND,1 for the period 1 February 2007\u201331 August \n2007. It has been prepared in accordance with paragraph 26 of the TAC paper, which requires \nsubmission of a consolidated report, every six months, to the Board of Directors (the Board) and \nthe  management  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  on  the  progress  of  TAC \nimplementation. The last BIP, for the period 25 July 2006\u201331 January 2007, was circulated to \nthe Board in March 2007. The BIP for the TAC was also shared with the Government of India \n(the Government) and the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID). The next \nconsolidated BIP for the TAC is due in March 2008. \n \n2.  ADB approved TAC 4814-IND for $15 million to the Government on 30 June 2006. The \nTAC is financed by the Government of the United Kingdom through its DFID. The TAC, provided \nin response to the Government\u2019s request, fast-tracks high-priority infrastructure projects and \nsupports improvements in project preparedness, project design, and implementation capacity \nunder  ADB\u2019s  India  program.  The  Board  had approved  the  inclusion of  project  preparatory \ntechnical assistance (TA) activities under the TAC on an exceptional basis.2 \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLUSTER \n \nA.   Impact and Outcome  \n \n3.  The  TAC  aims  at  enhancing  project  preparedness,  improving  project  design,  and \nstrengthening effective implementation capacity under ADB\u2019s India program. It will reduce the \nneed for stand-alone TA projects and will increase the Government\u2019s ownership of follow-up \nprojects. The TAC will improve the quality and delivery of the more than $3 billion ADB program \nof  assistance  for  India.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  for  the  TAC  is  provided  in \nAppendix 1.  \n \nB.   Methodology and Key Activities  \n \n4.  As a cluster grant facility, the TAC finances several component technical assistance \n(CTA) projects under the ADB India program for 2006\u20132009. These CTAs support a range of \nproject  preparatory  and  capacity-building  activities,  including  feasibility  studies,  preliminary \ndesigns,  safeguard  assessments,  capacity  development,  procurement  support,  detailed \nengineering designs, and project reports.  \n \n5.  The original TAC comprised 15 CTAs from the India program for 2006\u20132009 with an \noverall allocation of $15 million, including TAC administration costs. Subsequently, based on the \nrecommendations  of  the  Joint  Task  Force  (JTF)3  and  approval  of  the  CTA  papers  and \nimplementation plans by the director general of the South Asia Department (SARD), the TAC \nhas been expanded to include 24 component TAs. The revised list of CTAs included under the \nTAC is as follows:  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

However, \nTACs were restricted to advisory TA projects.  \n3 The JTF is the TA steering committee that deliberates on addition, deletion, and amount enhancements and \nreductions of CTAs. It also reviews progress on these CTAs. On the basis of recommendations by the JTF, formal \napproval for CTAs is obtained from the director general of the South Asia Department.

Appendix 2 shows key revisions in the original composition of the TA cluster. The \nrevisions reflect the Government\u2019s sectoral and capacity-building priorities with respect to ADB\u2019s \noperations  and  program  in  India.  The  revisions  were  also  based  on  (i)  review  of  project \nreadiness; (ii) revisions in the project processing schedule for 2006\u20132009; (iii) consultations with \nproject executing agencies; (iv) reconsideration of the scope, suitability, and focus of the CTAs; \nand (v) suggestions of  the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) and ADB sector managers.  \n \nC.   Cost and Financing \n \n7.  The $15 million TAC is financed by the Government of the United Kingdom on a grant \nbasis. The Government of India provides counterpart contributions in kind estimated at $4 \nmillion. The revisions to the original list of CTAs included under the TA cluster have had no \nimpact on the cost estimate and financing arrangements. The Government has agreed that \napproval of the CTAs does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing projects.  \n ", "  3\nD.   Implementation Arrangements \n \n8.  The TAC is executed by the DEA and administered by the India Resident Mission for a \nperiod of 30 months, from July 2006 to December 2008. The JTF consists of the joint secretary \nand the director of the DEA, the country director and sector specialists from the India Resident \nMission, and SARD sector directors and mission leaders responsible for the CTA projects. \nInternational and national consultants are engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nIII.  PROGRESS IN IMPLEMENTATION \n \nA.  Progress against Goals and Overall Impact \n \n9.  Five Development Projects Take Off Within a Year. The TAC has directly contributed \nto detailed project preparedness through relevant CTAs for five loans amounting to $1.59 billion \napproved in 2006 and 2007. These loans are for the Madhya Pradesh State Roads II Project \n($320 million), the Madhya Pradesh Power Sector Development Investment Program ($620 \nmillion), the Jammu and Kashmir Urban Sector Investment Program ($300 million), the North \nKarnataka  Urban  Sector  Investment  Program  ($270  million),  and  the  Kolkata  Environment \nImprovement Project (Supplementary Financing) ($80 million). Project preparatory and detailed \ndesign activities for another 14 loans estimated at $3.7 billion are ongoing for possible approval \nin 2007\u20132009. Estimates indicate that each $1 million spent under the TAC has the potential to \nleverage development investment of more than $350 million. \n \n10.  Support  to  New  Partner  States  and  Pro-Poor  Sectors:  Capacity  Building  and \nAdvisory Support. The Government has recognized the flexibility and responsiveness the TAC \noffers  in  relation  to  improving  project  preparedness  under  ADB\u2019s  India  program.  It  has \nappreciated  the  TAC\u2019s  flexibility  in  addressing  the  advisory,  capacity\u2013building,  and  project \npreparatory requirements of new sectors and of the comparatively less developed states of \nBihar, Chattisgarh, and Jharkhand and of the northeastern region. The TAC is also supporting \nemergent priority areas of the Government, as reflected by CTAs on agribusiness infrastructure, \ntourism infrastructure, flood and riverbank erosion control, natural resource management, clean \nenergy, and infrastructure financing.  \n \n11.  The  TAC  has  been  providing  capacity  development  support  to  many  of  these  less \ndeveloped states and new subsectors. Prominent among the new sectors supported under the \nTAC are commodity futures, municipal infrastructure financing, wetland management, trade and \ninvestment infrastructure in the northeastern states, and housing finance.  \n \n12.  Enhanced Client Ownership and Responsiveness. The TAC has been responsive to \nthe  Government\u2019s  need  for  comprehensive  project  preparation,  improved  efficiency,  and \nenhanced ownership of project preparation and implementation under ADB\u2019s India program. \nThe TAC modality and the provisions for a JTF have enabled the Government to directly \nparticipate and be involved in the planning and close monitoring of project preparation activities \nunder ADB\u2019s India program. \n \n13.  Considerable Time Savings. The TAC has  significantly improved the efficiency of \npreparing, processing, and approving TAs, aided by the TAC\u2019s simplified procedure. Within 12 \nmonths of TAC effectivity, 22 CTAs have been endorsed for implementation. The 24 CTAs \ncurrently included under the TAC will also result in improving the planning and operational \ncapacity of the executing agencies of the proposed follow-up loans.  ", "4   \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities Under the TAC \n \n14.  Twenty-Four CTAs for $14.88 Million Included Under the TA Cluster.  Based on JTF \nor DEA endorsement, the total number of CTAs included under the TAC has increased from 15 \nto 24, as of 31 August 2007. This includes the four CTAs that were included under the TAC \nduring the 1 February 2007\u201331 August 2007 reporting period. Appendix 2 presents the revised \nlist of CTAs included under the TAC.  \n \n15.  Twenty-Two  CTAs  for  $13.98  Million  Prepared,  Processed,  and  Approved  for \nImplementation. Since TAC effectivity on 25 July 2006, the director general of SARD has \napproved a total of 22 CTAs for $13.98 million for implementation. This includes the 10 CTAs \nthat were prepared, processed, and approved for implementation during the reporting period. \nOnly two CTAs worth $0.9 million are currently under preparation. Their inclusion is subject to \napproval of their implementation plan or TA paper by the director general of SARD.  As of 31 \nAugust 2007, the 22 CTAs had committed nearly $8 million and disbursed $1.5 million. \n \n16.  Three CTAs Completed. Implementation has been completed for three CTAs: (i) the \nNational  Hydroelectric  Power  Corporation  Capacity  Development  Project,  (ii)  the  Madhya \nPradesh Power Sector Investment Program, and (iii) project preparation support for the Madhya \nPradesh  State  Roads  Project  II.  Implementation  for  seven  more  CTAs  is  expected  to  be \ncompleted by December 2007. Implementation of the remaining 14 CTAs will be completed by \nJune 2008, ahead of the TAC completion date of 31 December 2008. \n \n17.  JTF  Deliberations.  The  JTF  has  been  proactively  guiding  and  overseeing  the \nprogramming and implementation of the TAC. The JTF met 4 times during the first 12 months of \nTAC implementation to steer and streamline the composition of the TAC. Based on inputs from \nADB staff, executing agencies, and the DEA, the JTF reviewed the relevance, implementation \nschedule, and financial allocation of each CTA with respect to the India program for 2006\u20132009. \nIt recommended changes in the composition of the TAC that included canceling 3 CTAs, adding \n12 new CTAs, increasing the financial allocation of 3 CTAs, and reducing the financial allocation \nof 6 CTAs. These revisions (Appendix 2) reflect the Government\u2019s project scheduling and \nsectoral priorities with respect to ADB\u2019s operations and program in India.  \n \nIV.  CONCLUSION  \n \n18.  The TAC has highlighted the importance of supporting project readiness for timely and \ncost-effective delivery of ADB\u2019s India program. By doing so, the TAC has established a close \nlink between country programming and project preparation activities.  \n \n19.  Implementation  of  the  TAC  is  on  track  to  deliver  its  intended  outcomes,  namely, \nimproving project implementation readiness, strengthening local capacity and ownership, and \nenhancing the efficiency of project preparation and implementation. Most CTAs were prepared \nso as to be completed by 31 December 2007, even though the original completion date for the \nTAC  was  31  December  2008.  This  was  done  because  of  the  anticipated  closure  of  TAC \nfinancing from the DFID by December 2007. However, based on an assessment of  the work \nremaining to be done for effective operationalization of projects in the India program, the CTA \nproject officers have been given an option of extending their CTA completion dates to 30 June \n2008.  \n ", "  5\n20.  DFID financing of the TAC will close on 31 December 2007. Financing of CTAs beyond \n31  December  2007  could  either  be  from  DFID\u2019s  proposed  partnership  modality,  which  is \ncurrently under preparation and is subject to internal DFID approval, or from ADB\u2019s internal TA \nresources. If the DFID partnership modality does become operational on 1 January 2008 as \nanticipated, this would mean that the TAC would be financed under the new facility as of that \ndate. If DFID financing does not materialize, ADB would need to find and allocate internal TA \nresources to finance the CTAs beyond 31 December 2007. This would be in accordance with \nADB\u2019s commitment to provide a TAC of $15 million equivalent to the Government of India.   \n ", "6   Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData \nPerformance  Sources/Reporting \nDesign Summary Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact       \nImprovement of project  Subproject approval from ADB  Approval  Assumption  \nimplementation  accelerated  percentages in the  Commitment by the \nreadiness     India program  Government  \n  Procurement and contract     \n  awards accelerated  Disbursement ratios   \n \nProject implementation unit \nestablished  \n \nOutcome       \n  Investment projects identified   Implementation  Assumptions \nAchievement of better    plans and TA papers  \u2022  Active cooperation by the \nefficiency and ownership  Private sector participation    executing agencies and \nin relation to project  increased  System to monitor  commitment to reform \npreparation and    project  \u2022  Willingness of the private \nimplementation   Consulting team mobilized and  implementation  sector to participate \n  counterpart staff appointed  readiness  \nPromotion of private  within the agreed time frame   \nparticipation     \n  Disbursement of funds and \n  implementation of project within \n  the agreed time frame achieved \naccelerated \n \nNumber of component TAs with \nprivate sector participation [  \n \nOutputs       \n  Feasibility studies completed  ADB review  Assumptions \nFeasibility study     missions   \nDPRs for the component TAs    Executing and support \nDetailed design  completed  Project MIS data  agencies provide due support, \n    including (i) data and \nBidding documents  Bidding documents completed  Prepared reports on  information, (ii) resources for \n  PAM, training  land acquisition, and (iii) \nProcurement  Procurement process initiated  manuals, MIS  cooperation in providing \n  manuals, etc.  environmental clearance \nDue diligence   Due diligence of social and     \nenvironmental safeguard  TA consultants\u2019  Monitoring and quality support \n6.
