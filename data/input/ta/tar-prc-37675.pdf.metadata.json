During the 2003 Country Programming Mission, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (the PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide an advisory \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  for  a  study  on  Poverty  Reduction  in  Key  Forestry  Conservation \nPrograms.1 It was subsequently supported for funding by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation \nFund. The ADB Fact-Finding Mission visited the PRC from 16 October to 17 November 2003 to \nformulate the TA, and reached an understanding with the Government on the TA goals, purpose, \ncost estimates, financing, and implementation arrangements.  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Forests\u2019  roles  in  economic  development  and  in  soil  and  water  conservation  and \nbiodiversity protection are well recognized in the PRC. Events in recent years have focused \nattention on forests\u2019 important role in stabilizing the environment. In 1997 the water shortage in \nthe Yellow River caused substantial economic losses to downstream industry and agriculture, \nparticularly in Shandong Province. In 1998 major floods in the Yangtze and Songhua rivers \ncaused serious loss of life and economic damage. The frequency and severity of sand and dust \nstorms originating in the Western Region is increasing2. Nearly half the Western Region suffers \nland  degradation,  with  27%  of  the  land  eroded  by  wind,  16%  by  water,  and  10%  by \ndesertification, which  are closely linked to poverty as they reduce productivity and increase \ncosts. Continued degradation of natural resources aggravates poverty and constrains national \npoverty  reduction  programs.  To  break  the  cycle  of  continuing  degradation  of  forests  and \nincreasing poverty, the Government has adopted a number of major policies and programs.  \n3.  The State Forestry Administration (SFA) initiated six priority forestry programs (PFPs). Of \nthese, the Natural Forests Protection Program (NFPP), a key program, was started in 1998 \nmainly to rehabilitate and develop natural forests. A key component of NFPP is a logging ban on \n30 million hectares (ha) of natural forests in the upper reaches of the Yangtze and upper and \nmiddle reaches of the Yellow River. For other areas (including in the northeast, Inner Mongolia, \nand Xinjiang) the policy has been less dramatic and imposes only logging restrictions. These \npolicies also involve reducing timber production by about 20 million cubic meters, developing \n12.7 million ha of new plantations, maintaining 94 million ha of forests, and redeploying 740,000 \nstate forest enterprise workers. \n4.  About 60 million ha of agricultural land are on slopes of over 25%. Of the 2 billion tons of \nsilt released into the Yangtze and Yellow rivers annually, about two thirds come from sloping \ncroplands. In 1999 the Government adopted a policy to convert steep cultivated lands into \nforests and grasslands, which SFA is implementing under its Conversion of Cropland to Forest \nand  Grassland  Program  (CCFG).  In  2000  CCFG  pilot  projects  were  implemented  in  13 \nprovinces.  Other  relevant  SFA  programs  to  reverse  environmental  degradation  are  (i) key \nshelterbelt development programs in such regions as the Three North and the middle and lower \nreaches of Yangtze River Forest Protection, (ii) Sandification Control Program for Areas in the \nVicinity of Beijing, (iii) Wildlife Conservation and Nature Reserve Development Program, and (iv) \nForest Industrial Base Development Program in Key Regions with Focus on Fast-Growing and \nHigh-Yielding Timber Plantations.  \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 1 September 2003. \n2  The Western region covers six provinces (Gansu, Guizhou, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan); five autonomous \nregions (Guangxi Zhuang, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia Hui, Tibet, and Xinjiang Uygur); and Chongqing municipality. ", "2    \n5.  Planning and implementation of the CCFG are more complex  than that of the NFPP \nbecause the CCFG deals with millions of smallholders, and the NFPP only with hundreds of \nforest enterprises. The CCFG\u2019s financial arrangement also differs from NFPP\u2019s. The NFPP is \ndesigned to ease the hardship of state-owned enterprises and facilitate their transition from \ntraditional logging to forest stewardship. The CCFG is essentially a public payment scheme, \nwhich compensates private farmers for conversion of farmland back to tree cover or grasslands. \nThe income of participating farmers is often increased as long as the compensation payments \nare applicable (5 or 8 years). However, the long-term sustainability of CCFG needs to be \nconfirmed. Many local economies are suffering due to downsizing of agriculture and subsequent \ncontraction of local agribusiness. Alternative jobs are often difficult to find, and local government \nrevenue is decreasing. Some evidence shows that compensation in the form of food subsidies \nmay be bringing down local farm-gate prices. \n6.  Although the environmental benefits of the PFPs have yet to be fully evaluated, they have \nevidently had an impressive impact on the environment and ecology. However, a recent study by \na China Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development (CCICED) task \nforce3  has  noted  potentially  adverse  social,  economic,  and  fiscal  consequences,  including \nreduced livelihoods, diminishing fiscal returns, high costs of implementation, tenure insecurity, \nand  accelerated  increases  in  timber  imports.  State-owned  forest  enterprises  suffering  from \nserious  resource  depletion  and  the  economic  crisis  before  the  logging  ban  welcomed  the \nprogram\u2019s financial support, which included payments to redundant workers. Local authorities or \nimplementing  entities  often  regard  the  NFPP  as  a  program  to  strengthen  state-owned \nenterprises,  focusing  on  payments  to  enterprise  workers,  rather  than  on  funding  forest \nconservation. Nevertheless, the logging ban has further eroded the enterprises\u2019 bottom-line. \nLocal governments previously dependent on logging have seen a severe reduction in fiscal \nrevenues.  \n7.  The task force study also noted weaknesses in the policy framework for sustained \nprotection and production in the forest-based economies in a socially acceptable manner. Key \nproblems include insufficient local budgets required for implementation, slow implementation due \nto  delays  in  approval  of  plans  and  fund  appropriation,  use  of  a  top-down approach and \ninadequate  local  participation  in  program  designs,  disagreements  over  objectives,  and \nmanagement problems. The PFPs lack a proper monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system. \nCurrent M&E work focuses on implementation targets (trees planted and whether funds are \nproperly handled) but not on whether the programs are achieving their environmental and social \ngoals at minimal social cost.   \n8.  The Government\u2019s commitment to sustainable resource management is reflected in the \nTenth Five-Year Plan, 2001-2005, which emphasizes stronger economic restructuring to sustain \nnatural resources management and preserve the environment. The plan gives high priority to the \nagriculture sector to maintain the momentum achieved under the Ninth Five-Year Plan. With \nspecific reference to natural resources, the Government\u2019s strategic objectives are to reduce \ndegradation of natural ecological systems and integrate environmental planning with social and \neconomic development.  The adoption of the PRC\u2019s 10-year poverty strategy in May 2001 \nconfirms the Government\u2019s commitment to reduce poverty without compromising environmental \nstability.  \n                                                 \n3  China Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development. 2002. Implementing the Natural Forest \nProtection Program and the Sloping Land Conversion Program: Lessons and Policy Recommendations (unpublished \nreport).   ", "  3\n9.  The  PRC  has  already  invested  increasing  resources  in  the  battle  against  forest \ndegradation and cropland erosion. However, poverty and environmental concerns need to be \nbetter integrated. Other programs to improve the livelihoods of poor rural people need to be \nstreamlined and strengthened. The Government, while recognizing the value of the analysis \ncarried out earlier by (CCICED) and others, understands the need for a comprehensive and \ndetailed analysis that establishes linkages between the programs and socioeconomic well-being \nof the people, especially the poor, and the need to enhance the effectiveness of these programs. \nThis analysis, to be carried out under the proposed TA is considered particularly important since \nthese  programs  have  the  potential  to  reduce  poverty  by  enhancing  income-generation \nopportunities,  adopting  conservation-oriented  land-use  practices,  and  stabilizing  the  rural \nenvironment for better land management.  While complementing ADB\u2019s efforts to control land \ndegradation,4 the TA will allow the Department of Agriculture (DOA) in the Ministry of Finance \n(MOF) to actively participate in analyzing and reformulating policies that integrate cost-effective \nmeans of environmental rehabilitation with poverty reduction. The analysis must be based on \nwell-designed surveys that determine the impact of key PFPs on the socioeconomic well-being of \naffected people, especially the poor.  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The TA purpose is to evaluate the environmental and socioeconomic impact of selected \nPFPs on affected people in general and the poor in particular to establish a basis for policy \nreforms  to  enhance  their  effectiveness.  The  TA  will  recommend  adjustments  in  the  policy \nframework  and  program  implementation  arrangements  to  prevent  adverse  impacts  on  the \nlivelihood of affected people, reduce poverty by promoting sustainable livelihoods, and enhance \nPFP\u2019s  cost-effectiveness. To that end, the TA will assess the socioeconomic and fiscal aspects, \ncost effectiveness, implementation efficiency of PFPs, and establish a poverty-related monitoring \nand evaluation (M&E) system to guide stakeholders and decision makers. See Appendix 1 for \nthe TA framework. \n11.  The TA\u2019s scope of work and outputs from the work program include the following: \n(i)  analytical  review  of  the  objectives,  policy  framework,  procedures,  and \nimplementation arrangements, and status of PFPs to determine their strengths; \nweaknesses; cost-effectiveness; and fiscal implications, including impacts on \npoverty reduction;  \n(ii)  analysis  of  the  linkages  between  poverty  and  environmental  degradation  to \nidentify policies and practices that can have long-term benefits for the poor;  \n(iii)  analytical  overview  of  experiences  and  lessons  from  local and international \nstudies and projects on poverty reduction (including those funded by ADB) to \nidentify good practices and successful and replicable models;  \n(iv)  recommended adjustments in the policy framework and PFPs to ensure that \npoverty objectives are realized while addressing environmental concerns; \n(v)  a  prioritized  implementation  schedule  of  the  proposed  changes  in  policies, \nprocedures, and implementation of PFPs with associated legal and institutional \nchanges, and budgetary implications; and  \n                                                 \n4  As reflected in ADB. 2002.

Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  To keep the study focused and manageable, given the limited budget under the TA, six to \neight representative case studies involving rapid rural appraisals and field surveys, targeted at \nstakeholders (including the poor), will be undertaken in Shaanxi, Sichuan, Jiangxi, and Hebei. \nThese provinces have been selected because they are representative, and host major PFP \nactivities that reduce poverty (Appendix 2). The case studies and surveys will assess the \nproblems and issues associated with implementing selected programs, their linkage with poverty \nand environmental degradation (including before and after implementation, and the effectiveness \nof their management from a financial perspective).  These programs will include NFPP, CCFG, \nSandification Control Program for Areas in the Vicinity of Beijing, and Forest Industrial Base \nDevelopment Program in Key Regions with Focus on Fast-Growing and High-Yielding Timber \nPlantations. The case studies and surveys will also assess the economic and social impacts \n(including effect on household incomes); costs (compensation, implementation, and loss of \nrevenue); and distributional impact of the programs\u2019 benefits and costs. The case studies will \nhelp identify policies, programs, and models that are sustainable and reduce poverty. \n13.  During  the  inception  of  the  TA  study,  a  seminar  will  be  held  within  3  weeks  of \ncommencement to explain the study\u2019s purpose and proposed activities and to present the \nconsultants\u2019 work plan. The TA will be carried out to address the concerns of, and the impact on,  \nformulating policies, actions, projects, and programs. Particularly, the study will give attention to \nparticipatory approaches to target the poor in the SFA program areas; decentralize initiatives; \npromote private sector participation; and enhance participatory and local planning processes, \nincluding  community  consultations,  women's  involvement,  and  incorporation  of  gender  and \nminority issues. All stakeholders will be intensively involved in TA implementation. National and \nprovincial workshops and seminars will be held as required. A final seminar will disseminate the \nfindings to a wide audience. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $500,000,  comprising  $90,000  in  foreign \nexchange and $410,000 equivalent in local currency. The TA will be financed on a grant basis \nequivalent to $400,000 by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund. By providing counterpart \nstaff, office space and facilities, and support services, the Government will finance the remaining \nportion of local currency costs, estimated at $100,000 equivalent (Appendix 2). \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  DOA will be the TA Executing Agency. MOF will appoint a senior official as director of \nthe TA study. Given the involvement of other ministries and organizations in TA implementation, \na Steering Committee (SC) will be established, which will meet quarterly,  will oversee and \nensure smooth implementation, and coordinate and enlist support of concerned agencies. The \nSC will be chaired by the deputy director general of the DOA  and will comprise senior officials \nfrom DOA, State Council Leading Group Office of Poverty Alleviation and Development, SFA, \nNational Development Reform Commission, and MOF International Department as members. \nThe SC will have the option to invite representatives of relevant agencies, concerned provincial \nofficials, and other key stakeholders to its meetings. Individuals with expertise relevant to the \nstudy may also be invited to meetings of the steering committee. It will constitute technical ", "  5\nworking groups comprising professional staff of relevant agencies such as the SFA, State \nEnvironmental Protection Administration, and others as appropriate to provide guidance and \ninput to consultants, review case studies and reports, and recommend ways to strengthen policy \nreforms. An advance-payment facility will be provided to the DOA to fund seminars and/or \nworkshop. \n16.  The TA will be implemented over about 12 months, from March 2004 to March 2005. \nWithin three weeks after commencement, an inception report will be presented at the tripartite \nmeeting  comprising  the  SC,  consultants,  and  ADB.  The  inception  report  will  include  an \nimplementation plan; a work program, including detailed scope of work for each consultant, and \nthe  benchmarks  and  milestones  indicating  implementation  progress;  budget  requirements, \nlogistics, timing, and organization of field studies, data collection, case studies, seminars, and \nworkshops; and an updated TA framework. A midterm report will be presented at a tripartite \nmeeting comprising the SC, consultants, and ADB, six months after services start. The draft final \nreport will be also presented at the tripartite meeting one month before the TA\u2019s closing date. \nThe draft final report will detail the TA outcome and demonstrate how it responds to achievement \nof objectives. The final report will be submitted before the closing date, incorporating comments \nmade at the tripartite meeting or otherwise communicated. All reports will be translated into \nChinese. East and Central Asia Department and People\u2019s Republic of China Resident Mission \nwill closely monitor implementation. \n17.  TA  activities  are  described  in  Appendix  3.  The  TA  will  require 3 person-months of \ninternational  and  12  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  for  policy  review  and \nformulation; and domestic consulting services for  (i) case studies, surveys, and rapid rural \nappraisal (4 person-months); (ii) natural resource management (5 person-months); (iii) poverty \nreduction (4 person-months); (iv) gender and development (2 person-months); (v) participatory \ndevelopment  (3  person-months);  (vi)  institutional  arrangements  and  legislation  (3  person-\nmonths); (vii) M&E (3 person-months); and (viii) financial assessment and fiscal impact analysis \n(4 person-months). The international experts will help transfer knowledge and experience, with \nspecific reference to policies, approaches, and techniques for environmental rehabilitation and \npoverty reduction not yet introduced to the PRC. The international consultant will also help \ndesign and implement case studies and surveys and prepare reports. The consultants will be \nselected and engaged through a firm in accordance with Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nby Asian Development Bank and its Borrowers, and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for \nselecting and engaging domestic consultants. The consultants will be selected on the basis of \nsimplified  technical  proposals,  evaluated  on  the  basis  of  quality-  and  cost-based selection \nmethod. Provincial universities or other suitable institutions such as World Wildlife Fund China or \nCCICED, with prior experience in carrying out similar case studies and/or surveys, may be \nidentified  by  the  consultants  at  inception  in  consultation  with  the  DOA,  and  contracted  to \nundertake field surveys. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 to the Government \nof the People's Republic of China to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction \nCooperation Fund for the purpose of a study on Poverty Reduction in Key Forestry Conservation \nPrograms, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", "6 Appendix 1   \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \nDesign Summary  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions  \nIndicators/Targets  and Risks \nGoals       \n       \n\u2022  Help  the Government  Degree of achieving the targets  \u2022  Monitoring and  \u2022  The Government\u2019s \nreduce rural poverty  of  evaluation (M&E)  commitment is \nthrough sustainable  \u2022  the  priority forestry  systems  sustained. \nprograms (PFPs),     \nforestry program \nmanagement    \u2022  Periodic surveys   \u2022  Institutional capacity \n  \u2022  the People\u2019s Republic of    at the county, \nChina (PRC)  Eleventh  \u2022  Satellite imagery  township, and village \nFive-Year Plan, and   and/or surveys  levels is limited. \n     \n\u2022  the Ten-Year Strategic  \u2022  Government  \u2022  Budget allocations \nPlan for Poverty Reduction  statistics  are insufficient, and \n    local counterpart \n\u2022  Incidence of floods  funds are short. \nand drying up of river   \nflows, and other \nsimilar environmental \nills associated with \ndegraded forest \ncover \nPurpose  By the end of  technical     \n  assistance (TA) implementation:  \u2022  Policy changes   \n\u2022  Evaluate the  \u2022  Recommended  measures  adopted by the  \u2022  The Government\u2019s \nsocioeconomic impact of  consistent  with  the  TA  Government that are  commitment is \nselected PFPs on  study  findings  and  for  consistent with the  sustained. \naffected people in  adjustments  in  the  policy  TA   \ngeneral and the poor in  framework  and  recommendations.  \u2022  Coordination \nparticular to establish the  implementation    between various \nbasis for policy reforms to  arrangements of the PFPs  \u2022  Proceedings of the  government \nrealize their poverty  to prevent adverse impacts  tripartite meetings  agencies is \nreduction potential and  on the livelihood of affected    improved. \nenhance their cost- people,  realize  PFP\u2019s  \u2022  Reports and   \neffectiveness  poverty-reduction potential,  feedback generated  \u2022  Adequate financial \n  and  enhance  PFP\u2019s  cost- by the M&E system   resources are \n\u2022  Improve and strengthen  effectiveness,  acceptable    available to \nPFPs\u2019 M&E system and  to  the  stakeholders  for  \u2022  Seminars and  implement the study \nensure M&E of impacts  adoption  by  the  workshop  recommendations. \non poverty.
