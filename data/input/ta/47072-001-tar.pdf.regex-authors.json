INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  technical \nassistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for Promoting Foreign Investment to \nSupport Agricultural Modernization. The TA is included in the country operations business plan, \n2014\u20132016 for the PRC.1 ADB fielded a reconnaissance mission in Beijing on 18\u201319 March \n2014 and a consultation mission on 4 June 2014 to clarify and agree with the Foreign Economic \nCooperation Center of the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) on the impact, outcome, outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA.2 \nThe design and monitoring framework of the TA is in Appendix 1. The TA will  support a \ncomprehensive review of policies and international experiences with foreign investment of both \ncapital and technology in agriculture, conduct an in-depth analysis of the practices of foreign \nagricultural projects in the PRC, and carry out an assessment of the gaps between the foreign \nand  domestic  agricultural  enterprises  in  terms  of  operation,  management,  and  technology \ndevelopment. A policy note focusing on promoting foreign investment to support agricultural \nmodernization will be prepared based on the analysis and assessment. The TA will contribute to \nthe PRC\u2019s agenda of inclusive growth and private sector development, the importance of which \nis well recognized in ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Foreign investment in the agriculture sector has been growing in the PRC in the past 30 \nyears. The  actual  use of  agriculture-related foreign capital  was  $899 million  in  2001. The \nnumber more than doubled by 2012, amounting to $2.06 billion, with an average annual growth \nrate of 8%. Private direct investment, especially investments made by multinational agricultural \nenterprises, has played a major role in foreign investment in the sector since the mid-1990s, \nwhile  grants  and  loans  provided  by  foreign  governments  and  international  development \ninstitutions  dominated  the field  in  the  1980s  and  early  1990s. On  the  other  hand, foreign \ninvestment in agriculture (including forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery) has long stayed \nbelow 2% of the overall foreign investment received by the PRC. The percentage is significantly \nlower than the contribution of the agriculture sector to the country\u2019s entire economic output, \nwhich is roughly 10%. \n \n3.  Foreign investment in agriculture in the PRC is characterized by the following features: \nFirst,  investments  used  to  be  concentrated  in  the  eastern  region,  where the  physical  and \nnonphysical conditions make the business environment friendlier to foreign investors. Gradually, \nforeign investment moved inward to the central and western regions of the country. By 2010, the \neastern  region  accounted  for  79.5%  of  accumulated  foreign  investment  in  agriculture,  the \ncentral region for 13.9%, and the western region for 6.6%. Second, the multinational agricultural \nor food-related enterprises, mostly originating from developed countries, play a leading role in \nbringing capital and technology into the PRC. Attracted by the large market potential and the \nstable supply of inputs, most top multinationals specialized in food and seed have set up \nbusiness in the PRC, and their operations cover almost all segments of agriculture, such as \nproduction, processing, or logistics. Third, most foreign investments go to crop farming and \nanimal husbandry, fewer to fishery and forestry. This may be due to differentiation in subsector \nregulations as well as different market prospects. The investments have covered almost all \nsegments along the agricultural value chain, with a focus on agro-processing and increasing \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2014\u20132016. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 31 July 2014. \n3  ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2011\u20132015. Manila. \n ", "2   \ninterest in production, raw material supply, and logistics. Fourth, foreign investors have brought \nin not only capital but also technology and other intellectual resources, e.g., marketing practices \nand  management  experience.  For  instance,  the  top  international  seed  companies  have \nestablished research and development centers in the PRC. By 2011, nearly 2,000 agricultural \ntechnologies had been introduced into the PRC from over 40 countries. \n \n4.  The  growing  size  of  foreign  investment  has  generated  complex  impacts  on  the \nagriculture sector of the PRC. First, the investment fills the capital gap and thus promotes sector \ndevelopment and agricultural industrialization. Second, the intellectual resources introduced \nalong with foreign capital deepen technology adoption and development as well as corporate \ngovernance,  which  led  to  greater  productivity  of  the  whole  sector.  Third,  entry  of  the \nmultinational  agro-enterprises  pushes  forward  market  reform  of  the  sector.  The  increased \ncompetition has both positive and negative impacts on the domestic enterprises. The positive \nspillovers arise from the latter\u2019s imitation and market orientation, and from direct partnership \nwith foreign investors. Nonetheless, the domestic enterprises generally are considerably weaker \nthan  their  foreign  counterparts,  particularly  where  value  chain  development,  branding  and \nmarketing, research and development, and access to international consumption and capital \nmarkets are concerned. They normally face competition pressure from the foreign enterprises \nrather than collaboration opportunities when they tend to grow larger. \n \n5.  Importance is attached to further opening the agriculture sector, which is regarded as a \nkey  approach  to  achieving  agricultural  modernization,  in  both  the  12th  Five-Year  Plan  for \nNational Agriculture and Rural Economic Development (2011\u20132015) and the National Modern \nAgriculture  Development  Plan  (2011\u20132015).  The  latter  specifically  states  that  developing \nmodern agriculture requires enhanced introduction of foreign investment with both capital and \nintellectual  resources,  optimization  of  foreign  investment,  and  adoption  and  adaptation  of \nadvanced  technology  and  equipment.  The  latest  official  document  on  agricultural  policies \nemphasizes that agro-enterprises are one of the main emerging types for agricultural practice, \nand support needs to be given for them to play a key role in agricultural industrialization and \nmodernization.4 Inspired by these documents, the TA aims to propose solutions to the policy \nquestions of how to promote and optimize foreign investment in the agriculture sector and how \nto develop a market where various players can participate in fair and healthy competition and \nmore collaboration can take place between the foreign and domestic agro-enterprises. ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy for the PRC, 2011-2015, identifies inclusive growth as one of the \nthree  pillars  and  private  sector  development  as  one  of  the  four  major  drivers  of  change. \nPromoting foreign investment in agriculture and agricultural market development can improve \nagricultural productivity and thus lift rural livelihood, lending direct support to inclusive growth. \n \n6.  Systematic information on the following is necessary to answer the policy questions \ndescribed above, but is largely missing at present: (i) the status quo of agricultural foreign \ninvestment projects in the PRC\u2014their strategy, operational models and practices, as well as \nhow they interact with the markets and government agencies; (ii) enterprise-specific gaps in \nbusiness  operation  and  scope for  collaboration; (iii)  sector-specific  or regional  demand for \ncapital and intellectual resources; and (iv) experiences of other countries that successfully \nattract  agricultural  foreign  investment  and  promote  collaboration  and  healthy  market \ncompetition. The TA will fill in the information gaps by carrying out a comprehensive review of \npolicies and experiences relating to the source and recipient countries of agricultural foreign \n                                                \n4  The 2014 No. 1 Central Government Document: \u201cViews on Holistically Deepening the Rural Reform and Expediting \nAgricultural Modernization.\u201d  \n ", "  3 \ninvestment,  in-depth  interviews  and  surveys  of  representative  foreign  and  domestic  agro-\nenterprises, and interviews with relevant government agencies. \n \n7.  Based on the collected data, the TA will answer questions and propose sound policy \nrecommendations on how to increase the quantity and improve the quality of agricultural foreign \ninvestment; how to optimize the investment distribution across subsectors, value chains, and \nregions; and how to promote healthy competition and collaboration between the foreign and \ndomestic agro-enterprises. The targeted policy audiences of the TA include the MOA, local \nagriculture  departments  that  are  responsible  for  planning  and  guiding  regional  agricultural \nforeign investment, and other government agencies such as the National Development and \nReform Commission (NDRC) and the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM). The TA is closely \naligned  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  the  PRC,  2011\u20132015,  which  includes \ninclusive growth as one of the three pillars and private sector development as one of the four \nmajor drivers of change. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The impact will be the modernization of the agriculture sector of the PRC as measured \nby  the  increased  ratio  of  agro-processing  outputs  to  agricultural  outputs,  and  improved \ncontribution of technological progress to agriculture sector growth. The outcome will be the \npromotion of foreign investment in the agriculture sector of the PRC upon adoption of policy \nrecommendations by relevant policymakers. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The TA will produce three main outputs: \n \n(i)  A study report on the status of foreign investment in agriculture. This will \ninvolve data collection and analysis based on interviews with and surveys of \nrepresentative foreign agro-enterprises, especially those set up by multinationals, \nthat  are  active  in  agricultural  production;  processing;  logistics;  and  research \nand/or services in the PRC from main subsectors such as planting, seed, animal \nhusbandry, machinery, and fishery. The purpose of the study is to acquire a good \nunderstanding of the strategy, operational models, practices, and governance of \nthe foreign agro-enterprises, and the constraints and challenges they face in the \nhost country. Relevant policies of the investment source countries will also be \nreviewed to understand investors\u2019 incentives and constraints from the homeland. \n \n(ii)  A  study  report  on  the  demand  for  agricultural  foreign  investment  and \nopportunities for the domestic enterprises to learn from and collaborate \nwith the foreign ones. The study will assess the demand for agricultural foreign \ninvestment in the sector, subsectors, and regions; gaps between the domestic \nand  foreign  agro-enterprises  in  value  chain  development,  branding  and \nmarketing, research and development, access to international consumption and \ncapital markets; and opportunities for collaboration between the domestic and \nforeign agro-enterprises. The assessments will be supported by data obtained \nvia interviews with government agencies in selected provinces and surveys of the \nagro-enterprises.  \n \n ", "4   \nExperiences  of  other  countries  that  successfully  attract  agricultural  foreign \ninvestment and promote collaboration and healthy market competition will be \nexamined  and  incorporated  through  literature  review,  and  study  tour  and \ntrainings. The study tour and trainings aim to offer the PRC agricultural policy \nmakers an overview of the best practices in promoting foreign investment in \nagriculture  and  market  development  as  well  as  first-hand  experience \ncommunicating with counterparts from the countries visited. Various approaches \nincluding  course  teaching,  field  visit,  and  face-to-face  discussions  will  be \nundertaken  to  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  the  study  tour  and  trainings. \nParticipants will mainly come from the MOA.  \n \n(iii)  A  policy  note  on  promoting  agricultural  foreign  investment  and market \ndevelopment. Based on the first two outputs, the note will recommend policies \nto optimize foreign investment in the agriculture sector, create equal conditions \nfor foreign and domestic agro-enterprises to compete, and promote collaboration \nbetween various market players. The policy recommendations are aimed to be \nadopted in relevant national or local planning. \n \n10.  One potential risk is that the studies under the TA fail to access high-quality data from \nagro-enterprises because the enterprises approached for the study may decline to participate in \nthe interview or survey. To prevent this, a large number of enterprises need to be approached \nbeforehand to ensure sufficient participation. The local departments of agriculture can help \nconvince the enterprises to cooperate. The TA subject involves multiple government agencies \nsuch as the NDRC and the MOFCOM. Coordination and policy dialogues across agencies are a \nchallenge. The executing agency of the TA will make the greatest possible effort to engage \nthese  agencies  for  guidance  and  dialogue  to  produce  more  balanced  and  useful  policy \nrecommendations. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $450,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of staff time, access to administrative data, assistance to \nfield trips, use of office space and facilities, logistical support, and other in-kind contributions. \nThe cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  MOA will be the executing agency of the TA. MOA\u2019s Foreign Economic Cooperation \nCenter will be the implementing agency. A TA management office will be established within the \ncenter and be responsible for (i) coordinating other departments of MOA, e.g., the Department \nof  Planning  and  Development  and  the  Department  of  International  Cooperation;  other \ngovernment agencies, e.g., the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry \nof Commerce; and provincial departments of agriculture for guidance on the studies, policy \ndialogues,  and  dissemination  of  outputs;  (ii)  carrying  out  day-to-day  TA  activities  such  as \noverseeing the TA consultants\u2019 work, conducting domestic reviews of TA outputs, and holding \nTA review workshops; (iii) planning and conducting study tour and trainings; and (iv) organizing \nan international conference for output dissemination and knowledge sharing. \n \n13.  The TA will be partially delegated to the executing agency and implementing agency \nbased on the Memorandum of Understanding on Enhanced Partnership on TA Delegation to the \n ", "  5 \nExecuting Agency between ADB and the Ministry of Finance of the PRC in November 2009. \nThe agreement indicates that delegation is limited to the selection, recruitment, and supervision \nof  consultants,  while  administration  of  the  TA  remains  with  ADB.  A  procurement  capacity \nassessment of the executing agency and implementing agency was conducted in 2008 during \nthe preparation of the Integrated Renewable Biomass Energy Development Sector Project,5 \nwhich found that the agencies had satisfactory capacity to carry out procurement under ADB\u2019s \nguidance and support. The executing agency and implementing agency recruited consultants in \n2013 for an ongoing TA for Study on Modern Agriculture Demonstration Area Planning and \nFinancial Support Mobilization.6 Their capacity remains unchanged. \n \n14.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  17  months,  tentatively  from  1  October  2014  to \n29 February 2016. The TA requires an estimated 24 person-months of consulting services \n(4 person-months of international and 20 person-months of national inputs). The consulting \nteam  consists  of  a  national  agricultural  economist  and  team  leader,  a  national  foreign \ninvestment specialist, a national agribusiness specialist, a national agricultural policy specialist, \na national agro-technology specialist, and an international foreign investment specialist. The \noutline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. \n \n15.  A consulting firm will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time), using the quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. The simplified technical proposal approach will apply. \nProcurement,  if  any,  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement Guidelines \n(2013, as amended from time to time). The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime).  Resource  persons  may  be  recruited  to  review  the  consultants\u2019  outputs  and  share \nknowledge  during  workshops  and the  conference  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  on \nrecruiting and administering resource persons. \n \n16.  An  international  conference  on  a  moderate  scale  with  50\u2013100  participants  will  be \norganized  to  disseminate  the  TA  outputs  and  share  knowledge.  The  targeted  participants \ninclude government officials from MOA, NDRC, MOFCOM, and local departments of agriculture, \nrepresentatives from domestic and foreign enterprises in the PRC, national and international \nexperts  on  agricultural  foreign  investment.  The  policy  note  will  be  submitted  to  relevant \ngovernment agencies in written form. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Promoting Foreign Investment to Support \nAgricultural Modernization, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2010.
