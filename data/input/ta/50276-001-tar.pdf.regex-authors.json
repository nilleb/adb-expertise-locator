INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has actively supported trade since the 1990s and \nnow more actively in line with the regional cooperation objectives of its Strategy 20201 and the \nregional  cooperation  and  integration  strategy  adopted  in  2006,2 which  identified  trade  and \ninvestment as one of the four pillars (pillar 2). Various ADB-supported subregional programs\u2014\nthe  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation,  Greater  Mekong  Subregion,  South  Asia \nSubregional Economic Cooperation, and Pacific Islands Forum\u2014identify the facilitation of cross-\nborder trade processes as a key component in furthering trade expansion within the subregions. \nThe recently approved Operational Plan for Regional Cooperation and Integration, 2016\u201320203 \nreaffirms  ADB\u2018s  support  for  trade  facilitation  under  the  three  outcome-focused  operational \ndirections: connectivity, competitiveness, and regional common goods. \n \n2.   At the same time, ADB has actively promoted good practices in trade facilitation through \na series of partnerships with other international organizations.4  ADB\u2019s partnership with the \nWorld Customs Organization has helped developing member countries (DMCs) improve their \ncustoms procedures.5 The partnership with the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and \nthe Pacific (ESCAP) has provided ADB\u2019s DMCs a platform for sharing knowledge on trade \nfacilitation  challenges  and  experiences  at  the  regional  level.6 Based  on  the  lessons  and \nrecommendations  from  past  ADB  projects,  the  ADB  Management\u2019s  response  to  the \nIndependent Evaluation Department\u2019s thematic evaluation study on regional cooperation and \nintegration, and the partnership memorandum of understanding between ADB and ESCAP, the \ntechnical assistance (TA) will continue to support trade facilitation in the region, particularly the \nAsia-Pacific Trade Facilitation Forum (APTFF).7 The APTFF has built the capacities of over \n1,000 DMC officials since 2009 and has launched knowledge products to guide the design, \nimplementation, and monitoring of trade facilitation.8 The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.9  \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2008.

Trade facilitation is also given prominence by the World Trade Organization (WTO) when its \nmembers adopted a Protocol of Amendment on 27 November 2014, which inserted a trade facilitation agreement \ninto the WTO\u2019s \u201cBali Package\u201d of December 2013. Ratification of the trade facilitation agreement continues, with 63 \nout of 164 WTO members ratifying the agreement as of September 2016.      \n5  The memorandum of understanding between ADB and the World Customs Organization originally signed on 4 May \n2010 was extended in 2015 until 4 May 2020. The two organizations agreed to continue collaboration on \ninternational and regional trade facilitation and trade security issues in the region.  \n6  A separate memorandum of understanding between ADB and ESCAP was originally signed on 16 May 2004 with \nthe following proposed areas for cooperation: supporting trade policy capacity building, trade facilitation, private \nsector development, and an enabling environment for small and medium-sized enterprises at the regional and \nsubregional levels. The cooperation with ESCAP has led to the establishment of the annual Asia\u2013Pacific Trade \nFacilitation Forum (APTFF), which has promoted trade facilitation as an important component of a comprehensive \nstrategy for national and regional development. In 2016, ADB and ESCAP decided to make the APTFF biennial \nand introduce a roundtable meeting in between to bridge. \n7  ADB. 2016.

Manila: ADB.  \n8  These outputs were noted in ADB\u2019s report presented during the 11th Annual Consultation Meeting between ADB \nand ESCAP on 12 November 2015. ADB and ESCAP co-produced a reference guide titled Designing and \nImplementing Trade Facilitation in Asia and the Pacific 2013 Update and a joint guide on establishing trade and \ntrade facilitation monitoring mechanisms currently being implemented in South Asia. \n9  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 17 November 2016.  \n ", "2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Increased international trade has largely benefited from major improvements through \nreduction in tariffs and nontariff barriers. Tariffs, both in most favored nation and free trade \nagreement rates, have been going down in Asia. Nontariff barriers, however, continue to impede \nsmooth transactions in trade.10 For example, significant costs to international trade remain due \nto complex customs and at-the-border procedures. Moreover, the progress of trade facilitation \nreforms significantly varies across economies as well as subregions. In particular, land-locked \nand sea-locked countries are facing serious obstacles to trade from the lack of integrated border \nmanagement, as well as cross-border trade facilitation coordination, which are exacerbated by \ntheir particular geographic circumstances that add trade cost.  With the general decline in tariffs, \nthe private sector has shifted its focus from tariffs to reducing transport and transaction costs, \nalong with other nontariff barriers. The gains from trade facilitation will surpass the benefits from \nfurther tariff reduction, with developing countries likely to benefit the most.11 \n \n4.  Meanwhile, international trade has undergone a transformation and a new landscape \nhas emerged, characterized by vast improvement in maritime and air shipping brought about by \ntechnological advancement and cooperation among economies. Just-in-time delivery and low \ninventory retention, multimodal logistics services, and the increasing complexity of supply chain \nnetworks  have  increasingly  added  cumulative  pressures  to  border  operations  across  Asia. \nThese developments and changes have underscored the important role of trade facilitation and \nhave required relevant border management administrations to strengthen their capacities to \ncarry out greater responsibilities and extended functions.12 \n \n5.  To respond to demand from the stakeholders and meet the challenges facing developing \ncountries in the region, on 24 April 2015, ADB and ESCAP extended their memorandum of \nunderstanding until the end of 2020, reaffirming their desire to work together in areas of mutual \ninterest in the service of the developing countries in the region. In addition, in the 11th annual \nconsultation  meeting  between  ADB  and  ESCAP  conducted  on  12  November  2015,  they \nacknowledged the achievements made on trade facilitation and committed to continue their \nsupport for regional integration and connectivity as one of the four joint priority cooperation \nareas with trade facilitation and paperless trade (technology and innovation) as core programs. \n \n6.  In the Support for Trade Facilitation TA, which concluded in March 2016, participants \nnoted  the  relevance,  knowledge  learned,  and  usefulness  of  the  APTFF  to  their  roles  in \nformulating, implementing, and monitoring trade and trade facilitation policies. The participants \nalso recommended ADB\u2019s continued support to the APTFF as well as the expansion and \ndeepening of ADB\u2019s research work on trade facilitation.13 This TA will further enhance the \n                                                \n10 In Southeast Asia, nontariff measures have even increased, which could complicate business. Deep integration \nwould largely eliminate nontariff measures that are highly visible yet riddled with political friction, are poorly \ndesigned, or are captured by special interests. L.

Similarly,  the  2015  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and \nDevelopment trade facilitation indicators find that countries implementing the WTO trade facilitation agreement \ncould reduce their trade costs; low- and lower middle-income countries could benefit the most from this. \n12 ADB.

THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7  The impact will be increase in the region\u2019s trade volume. The outcome will be improved \npolicies and practices on trade facilitation. The outcome will be measured through the number of \ntrade facilitation measures that are initiated or implemented in some DMCs, the information for \nwhich will be obtained through a survey during the forums.14  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The  TA  will  support  the  conduct  of  two  APTFFs  and  one  roundtable  meeting, \nenhancement of trade negotiation and trade facilitation policy formulation and implementation \nskills of DMC officials, and publication and dissemination of a research study report on the \neconomic  impact  assessment  of  trade  facilitation  especially  in  terms  of  quantification  and \nimprovement of progress monitoring. \n \n9.  Output 1: Asia-Pacific Trade Facilitation Forums successfully conducted in 2017 \nand  2019.  The APTFFs will be held in 2017 and 2019, with the objectives of (i) sharing \nexperiences  and  knowledge  between  and  among  countries  in  the  region;  (ii)  increasing \nunderstanding and exchange of views between public and private stakeholders, as well as with \ntrade facilitation standard developers and technical assistance providers; (iii) sharing lessons \nfrom ongoing implementation of the national and regional trade facilitation measures; and (iv) \ndeveloping  relevant  international  tools,  instruments,  and  facilities  aimed  at  increasing  the \nefficiency of regional and global trade.  \n \n10.  Output  2:  Roundtable  meeting  successfully  conducted  in  2018. The roundtable \nmeeting in 2018 is envisioned to be a bridge event between the two APTFFs with the objective \nof providing a venue for key government officials to discuss actions pursued immediately after \nthe APTFF in 2017, deliberate on crucial trade policy issues, keep the momentum of trade \nfacilitation going, and monitor progress on trade facilitation initiatives.  \n \n11.  Output  3:  Trade  negotiation  and  trade  facilitation  policy  formulation  and \nimplementation skills of developing member country officials enhanced. ADB will partner \nwith knowledge institutions specialized on trade to further build the capacities of selected DMC \nofficials for handling trade negotiations, trade facilitation, and other matters related to trade. \nDetailed criteria for partnership with knowledge institutions and selection of DMC officials will be \nprepared in consultation with ADB\u2019s regional departments and ESCAP. Specific training needs \nof DMCs as identified from existing ADB projects will be discussed with regional departments. \n12.  Output 4: Research study report published and disseminated. The research on the \nimpact of trade facilitation will be based on self-contained background papers.15  The TA will \n                                                \n14 Trade facilitation measures include country-based administrative circulars and memorandum orders on trade-\nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nrelated investments; export-related matters; price control measures; non-automatic licensing, quotas, prohibitions, \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nand quantity control; and sanitary and phytosanitary requirements. \n15 The background papers have been planned as follows: (i) An introductory, policy-oriented, and context-setting \nbackground paper will provide a regional overview of trade facilitation especially as it relates to the ADB-supported \n \n ", "4 \n \nassess the progress of trade facilitation reforms in the region through trade cost indicators and \nmeasure the potential impact of trade facilitation on outcomes such as trade, foreign direct \ninvestment, growth, and poverty. Most previous research on the quantification of benefits of \ntrade facilitation has focused exclusively on the impact on gross domestic product growth.16 \nMore comprehensive studies on the economic impact assessment have been requested by the \nregional departments during previous consultations with the Economic Research and Regional \nCoordination Department, pointing to the relevance of such research to ADB operations. The \nkey findings of the research will be shared with regional departments for possible pilot-testing \nand disseminated through the APTFF and ADB publications like the Asian Economic Integration \nReport.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000 which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The detailed cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 2.  \n  \n14.  For the conduct of the APTFFs, ESCAP will provide and administer funding support \nestimated at $200,000. Selected government hosts will provide administrative support and local \ncosts such as meeting packages and study tours which they will also administer themselves.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA will be executed by ADB and implemented by the Economic Research and \nRegional Cooperation Department. The Office of the Chief Economist and Director General will \nhandle the overall administration and supervision of the TA and at the same time lead the \ndelivery of the trade facilitation forums, including supervision of the consultants who will be hired \nto deliver the APTFFs, roundtable meeting, and training. The Office of the Chief Economist and \nDirector General will liaise and coordinate with the ESCAP and the selected government hosts \nfor the organization of the forums, consult and coordinate with the regional departments for their \ntechnical  inputs  and  participation  as  resource  persons,  and  arrange  the  participation  of \nrepresentatives from the DMCs. Experts from ESCAP will also be tapped. To deliver the training, \npartnership with knowledge institutions with a proven track record on providing training on trade-\nrelated matters will be explored along with possibly providing training as a side event during the \n                                                                                                                                                       \nsubregional programs. In line with recommendations from APTFF 2015, this paper may also include a regional \noverview of trade facilitation at the sector level (in particular in agriculture and services), and the emerging role of \ncross-border  e-commerce.  (ii)  A  second  background  paper  will  carry  out  a  review  of  available  data  and \nmethodologies that have been previously employed for the purpose of economic impact assessment, and an \nassessment of the suitability of various approaches in line with ADB operations. These include on one hand macro \napproaches to quantify economy or region-wide impacts such as computable general equilibrium models and \napplied econometric methodologies such as the inverse gravity framework; and on the other hand measurement of \nlocalized  trade  facilitation  interventions  through  time  release  studies  and  project  assessments.  (iii)  A  third \nbackground paper will employ a more systematic methodology moving beyond the standard principal component \nanalysis for the construction of a trade facilitation index for the monitoring and progress of trade facilitation across \nthe ADB-supported subregional programs. (iv) The remaining background papers will involve the economic impact \nassessment of trade facilitation as measured by the specially constructed trade facilitation indicators on foreign \ndirect investment, poverty and inequality, and economic growth. (v) A final background paper will outline policy \nimplications in light of the economic impact assessment. This paper will also examine how trade facilitation can \nfacilitate the Sustainable Development Goals.  \n16 ADB and the United Nations. 2009.
