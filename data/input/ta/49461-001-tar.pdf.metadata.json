INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The proposed capacity development technical assistance (TA) follows on from, and \nbuilds upon, the ongoing support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to the Government of \nSolomon Islands for strengthening maritime safety in Solomon Islands. In 2008, ADB approved \na  TA  project  to  transform  the  Marine  Division,  an  organizational  unit  of  the  Ministry  of \nInfrastructure Development (MID), into the Solomon Islands Maritime Safety Administration \n(SIMSA), a regulatory body administered by MID with responsibility for monitoring, assessing, \nand  controlling  shipping  and  shipping  services  in  the  country.1 SIMSA  was  subsequently \nestablished on 1 July 2010. \n \n2.  The reforms recommended by the previous TA did not progress as envisaged because \nof staff constraints, including the absence of qualified national staff available within SIMSA and \nin Solomon Islands to be appointed as SIMSA director. This led to the reforms stalling for 2 \nyears,  which  resulted  in  noncompliance  with  international  maritime  conventions.  The \ngovernment, in discussions with ADB, engaged an institutional maritime reform specialist in \nAugust 2013 for 2 years under the ongoing ensuing project, Domestic Maritime Support (Sector) \nProject, to assist SIMSA with the implementation of the reforms (footnote 1).  \n \n3.  The  proposed  capacity  development  TA  will  further  support  SIMSA  to  enhance  its \ncapacity to address maritime administration, meet regulatory and safety requirements, and \nrespond to the changing needs of international maritime conventions and obligations to which \nSolomon Islands is a signatory. The TA will assist in (i) transforming SIMSA into an autonomous \nentity  (from  an  organizational  unit  of  MID  into  an  authority  reporting  to  the  minister  of \ninfrastructure  development)  to  address  shortcomings  experienced  under  its  current \nadministration and to be better positioned commercially, (ii) supporting continuous reforms, and \n(iii) providing training for staff of the autonomous entity. \n \n4.  The government\u2019s request for the proposed TA was received on 8 February 2016 and an \nADB fact-finding mission was fielded to Solomon Islands during 22\u201329 February 2016. The \nmission  held  consultations  with  key  government  ministries  and  departments  including  the \nMinistry of Finance and Treasury, MID, Ministry of Development Planning and Aid Coordination, \nPublic  Service  Commission  (PSC),  and  Attorney  General\u2019s  Office,  and  confirmed  that \nrestructuring SIMSA into an independent and autonomous regulatory body is a priority of the \ngovernment. The mission received government concurrence for the proposed impact, outcome, \noutputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, terms of reference, and \ndesign and monitoring framework of the TA.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n5.  Solomon Islands is a large island country, with a land area of about 28,000 square \nkilometers. The country has one of the largest maritime exclusive economic zones in the world \nat 1,589,477 square kilometers; it is 23rd largest in the world and sixth largest in the Pacific \nregion. Maritime transportation in Solomon Islands is therefore an essential part of the domestic \n(interisland), regional, and international maritime industry. \n                                                \n1  Technical Assistance to Solomon Islands for Establishing Solomon Islands Maritime Safety Administration was \napproved as an attached TA under ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of \nDirectors: Proposed Administration of Grants to Solomon Islands on Domestic Maritime Support (Sector) Project. \nManila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 11 April 2016. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n ", "2  \n6.  The constitution created the Marine Division within MID in 1978 with a mandate to \nmanage  domestic  shipping  services  with  the  fleet  of  government-owned  ships.  In  2008, \nrecognizing the lack of capacity of the Marine Division to undertake maritime administration and \nsafety, ADB approved TA for the government to establish SIMSA (footnote 1). Under the TA, \nmaritime legislation was reviewed and the legal framework updated and strengthened through \nacts and regulations approved by the Parliament and Cabinet. The updated and new regulations \nwere expected to remove barriers to the effectiveness of SIMSA\u2019s regulatory role and meet the \nstandards required by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and obligations under the \nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The TA was completed on 31 \nAugust 2012. \n \n7.  The  reforms  initiated  in  SIMSA  were  expected  to  be  sustained  through  continued \nimplementation of the measures recommended under the TA and restructuring the organization \nin line with reforms undertaken by other maritime regulators in the region.3 However, SIMSA \nfaced several challenges in fully implementing the reforms. These included (i) the lack of any \nexternal assistance beyond the TA, (ii) the failure of MID to appoint a suitably qualified person \nfor  the  director  of  the  Marine  Division,  (iii)  limited  financial  allocation  to  SIMSA  through \ngovernment annual budgets, and (iv) frequent absences of key SIMSA staff as a result of long-\nterm overseas training and extended leave. SIMSA was therefore unable to fully conform to IMO \nrequirements  and  UNCLOS  obligations  and  received  warnings  from  international  shipping \nagencies that restrictions for entry of international vessels into Solomon Islands ports would be \nimposed. \n \n8.  SIMSA currently operates under the purview of the permanent secretary of MID and it is \na requirement that recruitment of employees goes through the PSC. In 2013, Solomon Islands \nwas found to be noncompliant with the International Ship and Port Security Code because \nSIMSA did not have international ship and port security officers, port state control officers, or \nenvironmental protection officers. An application for staff recruitment was made to the PSC in \n2013 and approval was given in 2015 for two international ship and port security officers and a \nport state control officer. However, there were difficulties in recruiting qualified staff to ensure \nmaritime safety. Together, these matters have inhibited SIMSA\u2019s compliance with international \nconventions and responsibilities. \n \n9.  As a government entity, SIMSA\u2019s revenue is collected by the Ministry of Finance and \nTreasury (SI$10 million in 2015) and pooled into the government\u2019s consolidated funds, but \nSIMSA does not receive sufficient funding from the government\u2019s annual budget to deliver and \nimprove  service. SIMSA needs modern, reliable information technology systems, and regional \noffices need to be properly established and equipped to monitor foreign vessels in Solomon \nIslands\u2019 waters and to oversee effective remediation of potential reef damage or oil pollution \nincidents. In addition, training of seafarers is an essential area that SIMSA cannot currently pay \nadequate attention to because of insufficient financial resources. \n \n10.  During the mission, the government confirmed that public sector recruitment practices, \norganizational management processes, and limited budgetary provisions for SIMSA are the key \nobstacles preventing efficient implementation of the reforms recommended by the earlier TA \nand  resulting  in  noncompliance  with  international  maritime  conventions  (footnote  3).  The \ngovernment confirmed that SIMSA needs the autonomy to manage maritime safety independent \nof government processes and to use the revenue it generates to improve its services. The \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance Completion Report: Establishment of the Solomon Islands Maritime Safety \nAdministration. Manila (TA 7178-SOL). \n ", "  3\nchange from an administration under MID to an autonomous statutory body\u2014SIMSA\u2014reporting \ndirectly to the minister, will allow the organization to not only address shortcomings experienced \nunder the current arrangements but also to increase the speed with which it can comply with \ninternational maritime conventions and obligations and be more commercially oriented. The \nproposed TA will enable ADB to assist the government in restructuring the administration to an \nauthority.  It  will  also  build  capacity  of  the  new  organization  to  ensure  that  SIMSA  is  a \nsustainable, efficient, and international treaty-compliant maritime safety organization promoting \nsafe shipping and clean seas in the region. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n11.  The proposed TA will provide long-term support (33 person-months over 3 years) of \nexperienced  maritime  experts  to  assist  continuous  implementation  of the  reforms.  The  six \nexperts will mentor and train proposed SIMSA staff to acquire managerial and technical skills \nneeded to address international maritime safety requirements expeditiously, and eventually \nwithout any further external support. Under the TA, the current organizational structure, job \ndescriptions,  and  functionalities  will  be  assessed,  and  recommendations  made  on  an \nappropriate restructuring model for SIMSA, as well as proposed measures to improve revenue \ngeneration. As necessary, the TA will recommend new divisions and/or job functions to meet \nadministrative, safety and security, aids to navigation, hydrography, marine search and rescue, \nand environmental obligations as required by the IMO and UNCLOS and other international \nmaritime conventions to which the Solomon Islands is a signatory. Under the TA, a training plan \nwill be recommended and during the term of the TA an intensive capacity building program will \nbe  provided  for  SIMSA  staff,  ship  owners,  seafarers  and  other  stakeholders  to  improve \nawareness on the requirements of the international maritime community and the need to align \nwith reforms in SIMSA. \n \n12.  The TA will assist SIMSA to prepare for the IMO-implemented member state audit. The \nIMO undertakes a compulsory audit of maritime organizations of its member countries to assess \nhow well governments are implementing their obligations under the maritime conventions to \nwhich they have acceded. Solomon Islands is scheduled to be audited in July 2019.  \n \n13.  The TA is aligned with the vision of MID to ensure effective transport infrastructure and \ntransport services to support sustained economic growth and social development in Solomon \nIslands as articulated in the National Transport Plan, and is identified in the Solomon Islands \ncountry operation business plan, 2016\u20132018.4 \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n14.  The impact will be safe shipping and clean seas in Solomon Islands aligned with the \nNational  Transport  Plan  2011-2030.  The  outcome  will  be  a  sustainable,  efficient,  and \ninternationally certified maritime safety authority in Solomon Islands.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n15.  The TA will have three core outputs: \n \n(i)  Output  1:  SIMSA  restructured  into  an independent regulatory  authority. \nThis  includes  (a)  reviewing  the  draft  reorganization  of  staff  and  making \n                                                \n4 ADB. 2015. Country Operations Business Plan: Solomon Islands, 2016\u20132018. Manila. \n ", "4  \nrecommendations for an appropriate restructuring model for SIMSA, (b) drafting \nbills for restructuring SIMSA and undertaking consultations regarding the drafts \nwith the Attorney General\u2019s Office, (c) assessing and recommending appropriate \nrevenue sources, and (d) preparing a transition plan for the change from an \nadministration to an authority. \n(ii)  Output 2: Increased SIMSA compliance with international maritime laws \nand standards. This is to provide continuous assistance to SIMSA and on-the-\njob  capacity  building  until  the  reformed  SIMSA  is  capable  of  managing  all \nrequired functions in compliance with international maritime laws and standards. \nOutput  2  will  proceed  upon  completion  of  output  1  and  passage  of  SIMSA \nrestructuring bills.    \n(iii)  Output 3: Strengthened capacity of SIMSA. This will provide targeted, short-\nto-medium-term training for current SIMSA staff to acquire updated knowledge \nand skills in ship inspections, port state control, environmental protection and \npollution control, quality management systems, internal auditing, maritime law, \nspecialist information technology for maritime conventions, and responsibilities of \nregistrars of ships and shipping officers. \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented in two phases over 36 months from August 2016 to July \n2019.  The  outputs  of  phase  1  will  include  passage  of  legislation;  review  and  update  of \nregulations; and restructuring of the maritime safety authority, an information technology system, \na human resource development and transition plan, and a financial management system and \nbusiness plan. Phase 2 will commence upon establishment of the authority and will include \nadaptation of the institution plan, recruitment of staff, implementation of the transition plan, \napproval and gazetting of all regulations, and commissioning of the information technology and \nfinancial management system. The training and capacity development of SIMSA staff will be \ncarried out under both phases. \n  \n17.  Together, these outputs and their associated activities will assist SIMSA in preventing \npotential warnings from international shipping organizations; contributing to reduced shipping \ncosts; promoting international trade and visits by passenger cruise ships to Solomon Islands; \nand encouraging the development of the Solomon Islands domestic shipping industry, with \npotential to branch out into international shipping. Prolonged decision-making and delays in \napprovals of the bills and regulations are considered to be the potential risks for success of this \nTA.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $880,000, of which $800,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff for each international consultant recruited \nunder the TA,  office space, furniture,  and  equipment for  minor  printing  and  photocopying, \nlogistics and administrative assistance, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  MID will be the executing agency for this TA and the implementing agency will be SIMSA. \nSIMSA will be responsible for providing the government\u2019s in-kind contributions. The TA will be \nadministered by the Pacific Liaison and Coordination Office. ADB\u2019s extended mission in Honiara \nwill oversee day-to-day administration of TA activities. \n \n ", "  5\n20.  A  steering  committee  chaired  by  the  permanent  secretary  of  MID  will  guide  TA \nimplementation. The steering committee will consist of representatives of MID, the Ministry of \nFinance and Treasury, the Ministry of Development Planning and Aid Coordination, and other \nkey stakeholders in the maritime industry, including private sector and development partners. \nSIMSA will act as the secretariat of the committee and regularly report to the steering committee \nand ADB on the progress of the TA. MID will designate a project director, who will be the \nprimary focal person for the TA.  \n \n21.  The TA will engage the following international consultants intermittently for a total of 33 \nperson-months over the 3-year period: (i) an institutional maritime reform specialist and team \nleader (18 person-months), (ii) an environment specialist (3 person-months), (iii) a maritime \nlegal specialist (3 person-months), (iv) a human resource management and training specialist (3 \nperson-months), (v) a maritime information technology specialist (3 person-months), and (vi) an \naccounting and public finance specialist (3 person-months). All experts will be recruited using \nthe individual consultant selection method following ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time). SIMSA is experienced in managing consultants recruited \nindividually. Qualified individual consultants with the above expertise are available in the market. \nThe TA will award output-based contracts following paras 2.9.2 and 2.10.2 of the Midterm \nReview of Strategy 2020 Action Plan.5 The outline terms of reference of the consultants are in \nAppendix 3. \n \n22.  The implementation activities of the TA will be monitored using intended outcomes and \noutputs described in the design and monitoring framework. The Pacific Liaison and Coordination \nOffice,  in  coordination  with  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  and  concerned \nstakeholders, will monitor the implementation of the TA. The training materials, workshop and \nconsultants\u2019 reports, and minutes of the steering committee meetings will support monitoring \nand evaluation.  The website created for SIMSA under the TA will be maintained by designated \nSIMSA staff after closure of the TA. \n \n23.  Proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The eligible payments to \ninternational individual consultants will be directly paid by ADB.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Solomon Islands for Strengthening Solomon Islands\u2019 Maritime Safety and \nEstablishing the Solomon Islands Maritime Safety Authority, and hereby reports this action to \nthe Board. \n                                                \n5 ADB. 2014.
