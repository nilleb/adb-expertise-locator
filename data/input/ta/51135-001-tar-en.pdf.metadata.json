INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Mongolia has requested knowledge and support technical assistance \n(TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support the General Authority for Intellectual \nProperty and State Registration (GAIPSR) in strengthening Mongolia\u2019s State Registration System \n(SRS). The TA will improve the accessibility and quality of state registration services in Mongolia \nand help establish the One Citizen\u2013One Registration Program.1 Improving the SRS is important \nfor the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. The TA is consistent with achieving \nthe objectives of the Mongolia Sustainable Development Vision 20302 and the Government Action \nPlan, 2016\u20132020.3 The TA will strengthen the SRS by improving the interconnectedness of state \nagencies that handle state registry information, supporting the shift from manual to electronic \nsystems, reducing discrepancies in data, and improving overall data quality. This will result in \nequitable access to registry services for all citizens. The TA4 is included in ADB\u2019s country \noperations business plan, 2017\u20132019 for Mongolia.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  GAIPSR is responsible for overseeing the state registry. It provides civil registration \nservices for citizens to open bank accounts; vote; and access important state services such as \nhealth,  education,  and  social  services,  property  rights  registration  services,  legal  entities \nregistration services, and archive services. GAIPSR aims to make state registration services more \naccessible and of higher quality, which is important in ensuring that citizens can fully use essential \ngovernment services, register businesses or property, set up bank accounts, or vote. This TA will \nhelp Mongolia fulfill its regional objectives by contributing to the regional action framework on civil \nregistration and vital statistics for 2014\u20132025. This framework was included as part of the \napproved Ministerial Declaration Get everyone in the picture launched by the United Nations \nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific in 2014.6 \n \n3.  Mongolia has managed to achieve basic online registration services, such as online \nregistration of property and legal entities, as well as an electronic archive database and a system \nthat allows citizens to obtain state registration verification from state service electronic points. \nDespite these achievements, the intergovernmental exchange of information remains limited \nbecause registration units have not been fully connected to the SRS and consequently the SRS \ndoes not have timely access to all the information it needs. Further, the lack of financial and \ntechnical resources has made it difficult to implement international good practices, such as \ncoordinating civil registration databases with other organizations7 that collect and use state \nregistry data, introducing technology solutions, and providing capacity building to government \nofficers. These issues have created problems for GAIPSR in fulfilling its mandate. \n \n4.  This TA is also important in the current country context. Falling commodity prices and a \nlack of fiscal discipline have significantly worsened Mongolia\u2019s fiscal position and undermined the \nsustainability of its debt. This resulted in the negotiation of an International Monetary Fund-led \n                                                \n1  This program is part of the government action plan, 2016\u20132020 and is officially part of GAIPSR\u2019s mandate. It aims \nto link the main registry databases through the use of a single registration number for each citizen. \n2  Government of Mongolia. 2016. Mongolia Sustainable Development Vision 2030.

Manila. \n6  United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific. 2015. Get everyone in the picture. \nBangkok. \n7   There are 16 government and 8 non-government organizations that either receive state registry information from \nGAIPSR or collect registry information. \n ", "2 \nprogram, backed by ADB and other development partners,8 which will enhance medium-term \ngrowth prospects. However, implementing this program will require needs-based targeting of \ngovernment services to improve social development under a more constrained fiscal environment. \nThis includes government services related to civil registration and those that draw on civil \nregistration information, such as social welfare, an area where ADB is heavily involved. This \nunderlines the importance of improving the quality of data produced by the SRS, which is an \nessential input into designing social welfare policies and allocating resources accordingly. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n5.  The TA will help the government implement the One Citizen\u2013One Registration Program \nby improving the accuracy of the existing state registry database and by removing or minimizing \nany  discrepancies  between  other  databases  containing  registry  information,  as  well  as \nstrengthening the soft infrastructure that underpins the system and building government staff \ncapacity. \n \n6.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: improved state civil registry services and \ninformation for social welfare policies. The TA will have the following outcome: strengthened \nconnectivity between inputters of SRS information, government users of SRS information, and \ncitizens accessing SRS services.9 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n7.  Output 1: Soum (county) access to online state registration strengthened. Currently, \n305 of 331 soums are not connected to the online state registration system. This means that they \ncan provide only 8 of 14 civil registration services and no services for property registration, legal \nentity registration, or archive use. Thus, citizens must travel significant distances to the aimag \n(province) center or to the capital, Ulaanbaatar, to access some services. These 305 soums \nfunction in an offline manner, whereby a citizen visits the local state registry office and the relevant \ninformation is saved onto an offline system, which is transferred as a compact disk by post to the \nnearest  aimag  center  or  to  Ulaanbaatar.  This  creates  important  delays  and  discrepancies \nbetween local offline information and the online civil registry database. GAIPSR has recently \nconnected Bayangol and Saikhan soums in Selenge aimag. The TA will help connect these \nsoums to existing fiber-optic cables by providing connection equipment and training. \n \n8.  Output 2: System enabling electronic registration services in hospitals created. \nHospitals provide birth and death registrations, which are important inputs into the SRS. In \naddition, hospitals are important consumers of SRS data, which they use to administer the state \nhealth insurance system. The existing system is plagued by several inefficiencies. When a child \nis born, the birth is registered in the hospital system, but often a delay of up to 30 days occurs \nbefore the parents register the child at the local registry office. This delay causes discrepancies \nbetween the databases. These are accentuated when it comes to infant mortality, since often \nneither the birth nor the death are registered in the SRS. Similar challenges surround death \nregistration. The Ministry of Health, the National Statistics Office, and GAIPSR have signed a \nmemorandum of understanding with which they have agreed to try to rectify these discrepancies \nby enabling registration numbers to be issued at hospitals and by better synchronizing their \n                                                \n8  The International Monetary Fund program was approved on 24 May 2017. \n9  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \ndatabases. All institutions have agreed to use the government network hosted by the National \nData Center (NDC) to facilitate this process. The TA will upgrade GAIPSR\u2019s software, enabling it \nto issue registration numbers in hospitals at birth. It will update the user interface to make it easier \nto input and access data. It will work with the Ministry of Health and the National Statistics Office \nto produce a software system that synchronizes the different databases. Training will be provided \nto ensure that relevant personnel can use and operate the system. \n \n9.  Output 3: Single shared database platform for all state registry information created. \nThe NDC provides hosting and server services across national government offices. GAIPSR \nalready provides eight of its services through this platform and represents about 80% of all data \nin NDC servers. The TA aims to build on the existing relationship by upgrading the GAIPSR \nsoftware system to enable it to more effectively link in with the system used by the NDC. The TA \nwill  also  strengthen  GAIPSR\u2019s  encryption  software  so  that  it  can  more  easily  meet  the \nrequirements of the NDC. These two steps will enable the GAIPSR system to be fully connected \nto the NDC. \n \n10.  Output 4: Support for effective implementation of laws and regulations related to \nstate civil registration provided. GAIPSR has already drafted four laws: the General Law on \nState Registration, the Legal Entity Registration Law, the Property Rights Registration Law, and \nthe Civil Registration Law. These laws will be discussed in the fourth session of the Parliament \nfor 2017. The TA will support GAIPSR with a plan for the preparation of bylaws and regulations \nto successfully implement these laws once they are approved. Executing these legal changes will \nenable GAIPSR to overcome some underlying problems in the system. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,624,000, of which $1,500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office and housing accommodation, office \nsupplies, secretarial assistance, domestic transportation, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  The TA will be implemented from 1 October 2017 to 31 December 2020. GAIPSR will be \nthe executing agency. ADB will engage a TA project implementation unit (PIU) composed of a \nfull-time TA coordinator, a part-time information technology specialist, a part-time procurement \nexpert, a part-time legal expert, a part-time monitoring and evaluation expert, and a part-time \nfinance and administrative officer to oversee the TA and help manage the consulting firm. ADB \nwill also engage a consulting firm to develop online and offline systems for the SRS, develop the \nintermediate database, and strengthen database coding. \n \n13.  GAIPSR will form a TA steering group composed of senior officials from the pertinent \ngovernment departments and agencies to ensure strong institutional coordination and effective \ndissemination. The deputy chairman of GAIPSR will chair the group. The composition of the group \nwill be sent to ADB for no-objection approval prior to the formation of the group. The TA \ncoordinator will act as secretary to the steering group and the steering group\u2019s purpose will be to \nguide the TA. In addition, the TA coordinator will form, participate in, and lead a working group \ncomposed of the PIU members and one full-time GAIPSR staff officer, and other GAIPSR staff \nmembers as appropriate. This working group will be responsible for managing the TA on a day-\nto-day basis and liaising with staff of GAIPSR and other agencies. Training on data input, platform \nand  interface  use,  maintenance  of  the  system,  and  anything  else  deemed  necessary  to \n ", "4 \nsuccessfully maintain and use any software or systems developed will be part of the consulting \nfirm\u2019s contract. The firm will also be responsible for formulating a capacity development plan. An \ninception workshop, a midterm workshop, and a final closing workshop will be held. In addition, \none study tour will be organized for a select number of GAIPSR staff to a country in the region \nwith a strong SRS. \n \n14.  TA  support  for  workshops  may  include  costs  related  to  venue,  equipment  rental, \ntranslation, printing and copying, meals, transportation, lodging, logistics and administrative \nsupport, and other expenditures with prior agreement from ADB. In line with standard ADB \nprocedures, the TA will not support the executing agency\u2019s management fees or related costs, \nsuch as staff salaries and allowances, and use of executing agency resources such as office \naccommodation, which will be provided as part of the counterpart contribution. \n \n15.  The executing agency will meet government staff costs and provide office and meeting \nspace. It will also supply data and documents required under the TA and cover the cost of office \nutilities for consultants. The executing agency will designate a TA focal point with strong English \nspeaking and writing skills, and will facilitate all TA activities and links to local government \nrepresentatives and providers to ensure the effective implementation of TA activities. \n \n16.  The PIU will establish a separate advance payment facility in United States dollars at a \ncommercial bank acceptable to ADB in coordination with the Ministry of Finance and in line with \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n  \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \n \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  1 October 2017\u201331 December 2020 \nExecuting agency  General Authority for Intellectual Property and State Registration \nImplementing agency  General Authority for Intellectual Property and State Registration \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nTA coordinator  36 person-months  $120,000 \nIT specialist  24 person-months  $95,000 \nProcurement specialist  12 person-months  $35,000 \nFinance and  25 person-months  $40,000 \nadministrative officer \nLegal expert   6 person-months  $30,000 \nM&E expert  6 person-months  $30,000 \nConsulting firm: online  100 person-months  $510,000 \nand offline software for \ncitizen\u2019s registration; \nintermediate database \ndevelopment; and \ndatabase coding \nimprovement \nProcurement  To be procured by consultants \nShopping  Servers  $75,000 \nShopping  Data storage  $35,000 \n ", "5 \nAspects  Arrangements \nShopping  Other essential office  $50,000 \nand computing \nequipment \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, IT = information technology, M&E = monitoring and evaluation, TA = technical \nassistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n17.

The consulting firm package (100 person-\nmonths in total: online and offline software packages for citizen\u2019s registration, intermediate \ndatabase development, and database coding improvement) will be selected by ADB using quality- \nand  cost-based  selection.  Lump-sum  payments  and  output-based  contracts  for  consulting \nservices will be considered in line with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 Action Plan nos. \n2.9.2. and 2.10.2. 10 The PIU members will provide inputs to the recruitment of the consulting firm. \nADB will engage the consulting firm and individual consultants, and all TA-financed goods shall \nbe procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) \nand the associated project administration and TA instructions. \n \n18.  The PIU will be responsible for producing the TA outputs and deliverables in a timely and \neffective manner, and for organizing and carrying out all TA activities. The PIU will report to the \nADB project officer. The progress of the TA will be evaluated during review missions, and midterm \nand final workshops based on the performance targets and indicators defined in the design and \nmonitoring framework (Appendix 1). GAIPSR will provide baseline data and verify the data with \nother government authorities. \n \n19.  Social media and websites. GAIPSR agrees to cover the maintenance of the database \nplatform, the rental of fiber-optic cables, the underlying databases, and the web-based interface \n(including website) upon completion of the project. This will be budgeted and accounted for in \nGAIPSR\u2019s annual budget allocation. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.
