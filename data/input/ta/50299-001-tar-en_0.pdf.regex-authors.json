Colombo port, located in the northwestern edge of the city, is virtually Sri \nLanka\u2019s  only  international  port,  handling  5.7  million  twenty-foot  equivalent  units  (TEUs)  of \ncontainer cargo in 2016. About 1.3 million TEUs of containers were destined for and originated \nfrom Sri Lanka, which is 25% of total containers handled. This figure will double to 2.5 million \nTEUs in 2030 with Sri Lanka\u2019s economic growth.1 The constrained site location would force the \ngreat majority of freight vehicles exiting and entering the port to pass only through the main gate \non a four-lane, ground-level port access road.2 The existing port access road leads to an \nintersection with Baseline Road, which is one of the busiest trunk roads in the city.3 The cargo \ntrucks, mostly through-traffic to and from areas outside Colombo city, have no choice but to use \nthe intersection, causing serious traffic congestion.4 The limited access route to the port, together \nwith  the  national  highway  network  radiating  out  from  Colombo,  creates  an  unnecessary \nconcentration of through-traffic in the congested city.  \n \n2.  The Japan International Cooperation Agency is providing \u00a535 billion for the New Kelani \nBridge Project, which will support the construction of a new bridge and elevated access road on \nthe Kelani River. The proposed project will support the continuation of this elevated access road. \n \n3.  The proposed South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Port Access Elevated \nHighway Project will construct about 5.3 kilometers (km) of an elevated toll highway in Colombo \nbetween the NKB and the city center of Galle Face through the Colombo port premises, and \nsupport trade logistics facilitation to provide better logistics services for port users.5 It will provide \na direct link from the city center and the port to the Colombo\u2013Katunayake Expressway via the \nNKB with a modern toll collection system, and then constitute a part of the expressway network \nof Sri Lanka.6 The project will help alleviate traffic congestion in the densely populated areas \naround the international port, and also improve logistics connectivity between the international \ngateway and potential economic hinterland along the expressway network, thereby increasing \neconomic efficiency and competitiveness of the country. \n \n4.  The project is aligned with the following impact: economic growth and regional trade and \ncooperation of the country facilitated. The project will have the following outcome: transport \nefficiency along the project road increased.7 The project is estimated to cost $360.2 million. The \ngovernment has requested a regular loan of $300 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \nto help finance the project. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2016.

Manila. \n2  The number of heavy trucks using the port access road was estimated at about 2,700 per day in 2017, and it will \nexceed 5,000 in 2030. \n3   About 300 freight vehicles per hour pass through Main Gate No. 6 (both directions) on Baseline Road during the \ndaytime.  \n4   The traffic origin\u2013destination survey in Colombo port shows that less than 10% of the containers originate from and \nare destined to Colombo municipal council. \n5   The project will construct a dedicated ramp to the port for port-related traffic. \n6   Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). 2014.

Justification \n \n5.  An envisaged benefit of the proposed project is to alleviate traffic congestion within \nColombo resulting from movement of port-related traffic and limited connectivity with the national \nhighway network. However, current trade logistics procedures, such as lack of a modern risk \nmanagement  system  and  other  modern  customs  tools,  combined  with  insufficient  use  of \nautomated systems, lead to queuing of cargo traffic at the port and may also hinder the proposed \nproject from realizing the intended economic and social benefits. In addition, movement of cargo \nto and from the custom examination yards, which have poor access, contribute to the congestion.  \n \n6.  A comparison of Sri Lanka\u2019s performance on various indicators of trade facilitation shows \nthat while it performs well compared with some of the countries in the region, it lags behind some \nof the Southeast Asian economies. Sri Lanka\u2019s average score on the Organisation for Economic \nCooperation and Development\u2019s (OECD) Trade Facilitation Indicators is 0.99 compared with 0.78 \nfor Bangladesh, 0.59 for Bhutan, 1.25 for India, 0.70 for Maldives, and 0.69 for Nepal in South \nAsia; and 1.13 for Indonesia, 1.27 for Malaysia, 1.75 for Singapore, 1.38 for Thailand, and 1.36 \nfor Viet Nam in Southeast Asia.8  \n \n7.  In recent years, the Sri Lanka Customs Department (SLCD) has introduced several \nmeasures such as risk management, a green lane program, and post-clearance audit to improve \ncargo clearance efficiency. However, these measures have not yielded the desired benefits as \nthey have been implemented in a limited manner (and have not been given full effect in their \nimplementation). As an example, risk management has been introduced, but the risk rules are \nwritten in such a manner that 80% of the consignments are targeted. Stakeholder consultations \nand an analysis of the situation indicate several areas that constrain efficiency gains in the \ncustoms  sector,  which  include  (i)  inadequate  use  of  modern  customs  tools,  (ii)  excessive \ndocumentation, (iii) insufficient use of automated systems, (iv) lack of a national single window \nand inadequate cooperation among border agencies, (v) absence of a port facilitation system, (vi) \nthe need to improve the inland cargo clearance system, (vii) on-the-ground issues that slow down \ncargo movement, (viii) ill-equipped custom laboratories, and (ix) inadequate capacity.9 \n \n8.  Consequently,  the  following  activities  need  to  be  prioritized  to  realize  the  intended \neconomic and social benefits of the proposed project: (i) improvements in risk management and \ndevelopment of a plan for a coordinated risk management system, and (ii) improvements in the \ninland cargo clearance system with the development of a new customs inspection facility at a \ndifferent location and the use of an electronic cargo tracking system (ECTS) to secure the cargo \nduring transit.10 \n \n9.  Risk management system. A risk management system (RMS) is an important tool that \ncan help Sri Lanka in facilitating legitimate trade while focusing on the areas posing higher risk, \n                                                \n8\\ OECD. Data visualization for key OECD data (accessed 14 May 2018). OECD\u2019s Trade Facilitation Indicators map \ninto the various sections of the World Trade Organization\u2019s Trade Facilitation Agreement and were constructed to \nmonitor the progress in implementation of the Trade Facilitation Agreement. Trade facilitation indicators range from \na minimum of 0 to a maximum of 2. \n9  Please see detailed sector background (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2 of the report and \nrecommendation of the President). \n10 An ECTS will enable regulatory authorities to track the movement of vehicles, cargo, and containers as well as the \nintegrity of seals applied on the trucks or containers, in real time, to alleviate concerns on cargo and revenue security \nand provide complete shipment visibility for efficient management of operations.  \n ", "3 \nand allocating resources efficiently. The SLCD has implemented an RMS using ASYCUDA World. \nHowever, the risk rules lead to a relatively high physical inspection rate\u2014in 2015, about 77% of \nthe customs declarations were taken up for examination. The inspection rate is also high since \nthe other cross-border regulatory agencies check the consignments (such as quarantine and food \nsafety). There is no concerted effort to coordinate inspections to minimize inconvenience to trade. \nThe export consignments are also subject to a significant level of checks. There is, thus, a need \nto revisit the design of the risk assessment framework, standard operating procedures, monitoring \nand review mechanisms, and organizational resources. The TA will facilitate studies to review the \ncurrent RMS in Sri Lanka, including the risk profiling and targeting criteria and its effectiveness, \nand recommend a suitable framework, standard operating procedures, monitoring and review \nmechanisms, better coordination among all relevant regulatory agencies in managing risk, and \norganizational resources to be applied to the management of risk. \n \n10.  Inland cargo clearance system. At present, there are multiple examination yards where \nthe imported containers are transported for customs examination and clearance. Movement of \ncargo to and from these facilities along constrained routes contributes to congestion in Colombo. \nThe SLCD allows movement of imported goods to customs bonded warehouses without payment \nof duty. Because of their non-duty-paid nature, the goods are moved under customs escorts from \nthe port to the warehouses. The SLCD affixes seals on the containers for securing the cargo \nagainst any tampering or diversion while in transit. This system to move cargo to the custom \nexamination facilities is not reliable. The seals are not tamper-proof and the devices do not help \nin live tracking of the vehicle movement or provide alerts on problems such as tampering or \ndiversion. The integrity of seals is not known in transit, and they do not provide any shipment \nvisibility. The TA will undertake a feasibility study for a new customs inspection facility and also \nconduct a study for the use of an ECTS to facilitate cargo movement. A trial run for the ECTS will \nalso be carried out and a report will be prepared on the outcome. \n \n11.  The TA is not included in the country operations business plan, 2018\u20132020.11 However, \nthe proposed project, the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Port Access Elevated \nHighway Project, is listed in the country operations business plan, 2018\u20132020 for approval in \n2018. Support for improving the RMS and for developing a new customs inspection facility is in \nline with operational priorities identified under the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation \nOperational Plan\u2019s strategic objective of enhancing trade facilitation. \n \nB.
