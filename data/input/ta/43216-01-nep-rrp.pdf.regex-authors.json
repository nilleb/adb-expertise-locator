I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto Nepal for the Transport Project Preparatory Facility. \n \n2.  The facility will assist the government\u2019s effort to ensure that critically important road and \nair transport projects are implemented efficiently by systematically advancing the preparatory \nactivities. The facility will identify and prepare high-priority projects for potential funding by the \ngovernment and/or by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) or other development partners in the \ncountry.  This  preparation  will  include  feasibility  studies,  safeguard  due  diligence,  detail \nengineering design, bidding documents, and procurement assistance for advance contracting (if \nappropriate). This will contribute significantly to (i) improving the implementation performance of \nthe ensuing projects by reducing the period between project concept and loan approval and the \ncommencement of improvement works, (ii) helping to achieve the intended outcomes efficiently, \nand (iii) realizing the projects\u2019 impacts and benefits in a timely manner. The facility will also \nprovide capacity development support to help establish an enabling environment, supporting the \ngovernment\u2019s goal of developing transport infrastructure under public\u2013private partnership (PPP). \nThe facility will prepare transport projects that will contribute to improving connectivity and \naccessibility throughout the country. The facility is also relevant to ADB\u2019s sector strategy in \nsupport  of  the  government\u2019s  goal  of  achieving  regionally  balanced  economic  growth  and \nreduced social inequalities. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Nepal is a landlocked Himalayan country bordered to the north by the People\u2019s Republic \nof China, and to the south, east, and west by India. The country is commonly divided into three \nphysiographic areas with dramatic differences in elevation: the mountains in the north, the hills \nin  the  middle,  and  the  Terai  (southern  lowland  plains)  bordering  India.  Because  of  its \nmountainous terrain and difficult weather conditions, roads and aviation are the major modes of \ntransportation in the country. \n \n4.  Nepal\u2019s road network is about 18,500 km long, comprising the 7,500 km strategic road \nnetwork (SRN) of national and feeder roads connecting district headquarters, and the 11,000 \nkm local and rural roads network. The total road network density is comparatively low, at about \n14 km per 100 square kilometer and 0.71 km/1,000 people.1 Due to mountainous terrain in the \nnorth, more than 60% of the road network is concentrated in the Terai. In the remote hill and \nmountainous districts, the poor condition and low density of roads hampers the delivery of social \nservices and access to shops, markets, schools, and hospitals.  \n \n5.  Civil  aviation  in  Nepal  plays  a  vital  role  in  linking  the  remote  areas  in  hilly  and \nmountainous parts of the country that are otherwise inaccessible by road, and is crucial to the \ngrowth of trade and tourism in the country. Nepal has 47 airports, comprising one international \nairport (Tribhuvan International Airport [TIA] in Kathmandu), four regional airports (Bhairawa, \nBiratnagar, Nepalgunj, and Pokhara), and 42 small domestic airports and short take-off and \nlanding strips. The volume of air traffic in terms of air passengers has increased considerably \n(1990\u20142010), with growth rates varying from 7% to more than 17% per annum.  \n                                                 \n1  By comparison, regional figures in terms of km/1,000 people are Bhutan 6.5, Sri Lanka 4.7, India 3.0, Bangladesh \n1.9, and Pakistan 1.7. ", "2 \n6.  The importance of the transport sector has been recognized and highlighted in several \nkey  national  plans  and  strategies,  including  the  government\u2019s  Three  Year  Interim  Plan \n(FY2007/08\u2013FY2009/10).2 It emphasizes the role of the road and air transport subsectors in \nimproving accessibility, which is one of the defining development issues in the country\u2014be it \naccess to opportunity, enterprise, markets, or services. Poor rural access and high external and \ndomestic  transport  costs  are  major  obstacles  to  achieving  one  of  the  government\u2019s  major \ndevelopment goals\u2014broad-based economic growth. \n \n7.  For the road subsector, the Department of Roads (DOR) under the Ministry of Physical \nPlanning and Works (MPPW) is in the process of implementing the 10-year Priority Investment \nPlan (PIP) 2007\u20132016.3 The PIP was prepared in 2007 with the World Bank\u2019s assistance and \npresents  a  detailed  strategy  for  the  development  of  the  SRN  and  recommends  a  list  of \ninterventions in the form of rehabilitation, upgrading, and new construction. The interventions \nare prioritized in terms of network connectivity, improved accessibility (including remote area \naccess), and network strengthening. These, collectively, provide connectivity throughout the \ncountry by providing interregional connections and links to district headquarters, international \nborders, and key economic centers. The SRN is also an enabler of local and district access by \nallowing development of local road networks within each individual district and facilitating the \nprovision of access to remote communities. The government, through the development of the \nSRN, aims to enhance national levels of social and economic integration, redress regional \ninequalities  and  imbalances,  and  reduce  levels  of  exclusion  in  the  remote  and  more \ndisadvantaged  areas.  ADB\u2019s  current  strategy  in  the  road  subsector  is  assisting  the \ngovernment\u2019s  effort  to  improve  and  expand  the  SRN  in  line  with  the  PIP,  including  the \nrehabilitation and upgrading of about 300 km under the ongoing Road Connectivity Sector 1 \nProject.4 The PIP is targeted to improve, upgrade, and/or add about 4,500 km of roads and \nexpand the total SRN to about 9,700 km by 2016. This is expected to raise accessibility, in \nterms of the percentage of the population that is within a 4-hour (or less) walk of paved roads in \nhill areas and a 2-hour (or less) walk in Terai areas, from 65% in 2007 to 85% by 2016. \n \n8.  For the air transport sector, the government has recognized the urgent need to improve \nsafety and capacity in view of the rising traffic, which is forecasted to double by 2019.5 At the \ncountry's  only  international  airport  (TIA),  airside  facilities,  runways,  taxiways,  aprons,  and \ncommunication  navigation  surveillance  equipment  are  not  fully  compliant  with  international \nsafety standards and recommended practices. The international terminal building is nearing its \npassenger  handling  capacity  and  the  domestic  terminal  building  is  operating  beyond  its \ncapacity. Of the 42 domestic airports, only 27 are operational. Most of the short take-off and \nlanding  strips  in  remote  areas  are  unpaved,  have  no  terminal  facilities,  and  lack  modern \ncommunication, navigation, and weather equipment. ADB\u2019s recently approved Air Transport \nCapacity  Enhancement  Project  is  designed  to  address  priority  safety  and  capacity \nenhancements at TIA and three remote domestic airports\u2014Lukla, Rara, and Simikot.6 In the \n                                                 \n2  Government  of  Nepal,  National  Planning  Commission.  2007.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Asian \nDevelopment Fund Grant to Nepal for Air Transport Capacity Enhancement Project. Manila (Grant 0181-NEP for \n$10 million and Loan 2581-NEP for $70 million, approved on 23 November). \n ", "3 \nlong term, however, the combined international and domestic passenger traffic volume at TIA is \nforecasted to reach 9.3 million passengers by 2028. To meet this demand, further capacity \nexpansion  and  safety  enhancements  are  envisaged  at  TIA  and  the  domestic  airports  and \nairstrips, particularly in the remote locations with high tourism development potential. ADB\u2019s \nassistance in the air transport subsector is supporting sustained improvements to and upgrading \nof the air transport system with emphasis on safety, capacity, and security, and enhancing the \nCivil  Aviation  Authority  of  Nepal\u2019s  (CAAN\u2019s)  institutional  capabilities  and  organizational \neffectiveness (footnote 6).  \n \n9.  To  further  expand  necessary  investment  in  infrastructure,  the  government  has  also \nexpressed a commitment to develop and implement transport infrastructure projects through \npublic\u2013private partnership. However, in both the road and air transport subsectors, the start-up \nactivities have been limited and there is a lack of a clear sector strategy and road maps. The \npreparatory capacity is low and institutional arrangement for implementation is uncertain. To \nfacilitate an enabling environment, there is a need to conduct sector diagnostics, clarify or \ndevelop  sector  road  maps,  and  provide  capacity  strengthening  for  preparation  and \nimplementation. \n \n10.  The main objective of the facility is to help ensure that critically important road and air \ntransport projects are implemented efficiently by reducing the implementation gap period that \nexists between project concept and loan approval and the commencement of improvement \nworks. The facility will systematically advance the preparation of high-priority transport projects, \nincluding  feasibility  studies,  safeguard  due  diligence,  detail  engineering  design,  bidding \ndocuments, and procurement assistance for advance contracting, as appropriate. The targeted \noutcome is a reduced implementation gap for ADB-funded projects from a typical 27 months to \n6  months.  The  facility  is  expected  to  contribute  significantly  towards  improving  the \nimplementation performance of ensuing transport projects in Nepal, helping to achieve the \nintended outcomes efficiently and realizing their impact and benefits in a timely manner. \n \n11.  At least two road transport projects and one air transport project will be prepared under \nthe facility. The road transport component will prepare improvement projects for high-priority \nSRN sections of about 1,300 km, identified in the PIP. To enhance subregional connectivity, \npriorities will also include SRN links to subregional transport corridors identified under the South \nAsian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Regional Multimodal Transport Study.7 \nThe air transport component will prepare capacity enhancement and safety improvements at \nTIA in Kathmandu and other regional airports, as well as the domestic airports serving remote \nareas that are otherwise inaccessible by road.  \n \n12.  The facility will also provide capacity development support to help establish an enabling \nenvironment  for  preparing  and  implementing  PPP  projects  in  the  road  and  air  transport \nsubsectors. This support will include  \n(i)  for PPP sector diagnostics and sector maps: (a) reviewing the legal, regulatory, \nand  policy  frameworks;  (b)  assessing  institutional  structures;  (c)  conducting \nstakeholder consultation; and (d) clarifying the sector strategy and road map;  \n(ii)  for  identifying  and  preparing  at  least  one  small-scale  pilot  PPP  project:  (a) \nassessing  and  selecting  PPP  options,  (b)  defining  procurement  and  bid \nevaluation processes, and (c) preparing bid packages; and  \n(iii)  procurement assistance, as appropriate. \n                                                 \n7  SAARC Secretariat. 2007.

A potential ensuing project will be eligible for preparation under the facility if it is (i) \norganizationally and technically feasible; (ii) prima facie economically and financially viable and \nsustainable;  (iii)  environmentally  and  socially  responsible;  (iv)  consistent  and  prepared  in \naccordance  with  the  government's  relevant  sector  strategy,  master  plans,  or  medium-term \ndevelopment plan; and (v) consistent with ADB's Nepal country partnership strategy.8 For the \nroad  transport  subsector,  the  facility  will  primarily  prepare  improvements  for  priority  SRN \nsections identified in the PIP. However, other candidate roads could also be considered if \nworthy in terms of improving accessibility (especially for poor people in rural areas); contributing \nto reduced social exclusion; and enhancing connectivity to regional and economic centers, \ninternational borders, and district headquarters. For the air transport subsector, the facility will \nprepare improvement projects to enhance safety, capacity, and security in line with the Civil \nAviation Sector Strategy and Infrastructure Development Plan,9 updated master plan for TIA,10 \nand the National Air Transport Development Plan.11  \n \n14.  The implementation of the facility will be phased in line with ADB\u2019s pipeline projects. For \ninstance, the preparation of about 900 km of SRN roads (subgroup 1) will start immediately to \nfacilitate  the  processing  of  ADB-funded  transport  projects  according  to  the  Nepal  country \noperations business plan 2011\u20132013.12 Preparation for the remaining SRN roads (subgroup 2, \nabout 400 km) will commence in about mid-2013 for potential transport projects to be funded \nduring later years by ADB and/or other development partners. \n \n15.  The road and air transport projects prepared under the facility will contribute to improved \nconnectivity and accessibility. The facility supports the strategic objective established in ADB's \nNepal country partnership strategy 2010\u20132012: assisting the government to achieve regionally \nbalanced economic growth and reduced social inequalities. The facility is included in the Nepal \ncountry operations business plan 2010\u20132013. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n16.  The impact will be enhanced transport connectivity. The immediate outcome will be \nimproved efficiency in implementing road and air transport projects. \n \nC.  Outputs \n17.  The outputs are (i) feasibility studies and detail design of road and air transport projects, \nand (ii) capacity development support to the DOR and CAAN for preparing and implementing \nPPP projects. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n18.  The facility is estimated to cost $13.80 million, including taxes and duties of about  \n$1.56 million to be financed by the government. The total cost includes physical and price \ncontingencies, and other charges during implementation. The investment plan is in Table 1. \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: Nepal, 2010\u20132012. Manila. \n9  ADB. 2006.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n24.  For the follow-on loans and grants, the engineering design will be carried out based on \nsite condition survey and investigation, and the proposed improvement works will be optimized \nfor economy and construction efficiency in accordance with best international practice and \napplicable standards.  \n \n25.  The technical due diligence will also consider climatic hazards and disaster proneness, \nand, to the extent possible, apply built-in measures to minimize the adverse impacts of these. \nFor instance, in Nepal, the excessive rainfall during monsoons can make steep roadside slopes \n ", "7 \nin the hill areas susceptible to landslides and inundate roads in the low plain areas. For the \nroads in the hill areas, bioengineering techniques will be considered (where appropriate) as \nsupplement to protect and stabilize roadside slopes.14 For the roads in the low plain areas, \nconventional civil engineering measures will be assessed, including embankment height, design \nvalues of storm frequency and runoff, drainage, and other appropriate technologies. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n26.  For the follow-on loans and grants, economic and financial viability and sustainability will \nbe  assessed.  The  economic  assessment  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nGuidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects,  assessing  the  economic  life  of  the \ncomponents and identifying the economic benefits of each investment component comparing \nthe with-project and without-project situation.15 For revenue-generating loans and grants, the \nfinancial analysis will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial \nGovernance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by ADB (2002), calculating the \nfinancial internal rate of return for the overall investment and establishing the financial viability \nby comparing the financial internal rate of return with the cost of capital, taking into account \nfinancial costs and benefits. \n \nC.  Governance \n27.  Policy and legal. The DOR, implementing agency for the road transport component, \nwas  established  in  1961.  Under  the  MPPW,  the  DOR  is  responsible  for  developing  and \nmaintaining the strategic road network comprising the national arterial roads and major feeder \nroads connecting to local and rural roads. The DOR\u2019s mission is to contribute to achieving \nsustainable socioeconomic development by providing safe affordable public road infrastructure \nservices through the building of a cost-effective, efficient, and reliable road network system. The \nDOR is headed by a director general who reports to the secretary of the MPPW.  \n \n28.  The CAAN, the implementing agency for the air transport component, was established \nby the Civil Aviation Authority Act in 1996 as an autonomous state authority, supervised by the \nMinistry of Tourism and Civil Aviation. The CAAN is responsible for the administration of civil \naviation in Nepal, regulating civil aviation and operating the national airports and air traffic and \nair  navigation  systems.  Legal  authority  for  the  government  to  regulate  civil  aviation  was \nestablished  in  1960  through  the  Civil  Aviation  Act  which,  although  amended  periodically, \nremains the fundamental enabling legislation for regulation of civil aviation in Nepal.  \n \n29.  Institutional capacity. The DOR has a good track record of implementing ADB-funded \nprojects, and its capacity is being further enhanced under ADB\u2019s ongoing capacity development \ntechnical assistance, which includes training to carry out feasibility studies for road transport \nprojects, and learning best practices in contract management and quality assurance systems \n(footnote 4). The CAAN\u2019s performance in regulating civil aviation has ensured that a good safety \nrecord has been achieved for air transport operations in Nepal\u2019s uniquely hazardous aviation \nenvironment, while the operation of the airport and air navigation system has generated a profit \nfor  the  CAAN  since  2004.  ADB\u2019s  recently  approved  Air  Transport  Capacity  Enhancement \nProject  will  assess  further  improvement  needs  and  will  implement  a  3-year  capacity \n                                                 \n14  Bioengineering combines vegetation with minor structures to protect and stabilize slopes, combining indigenous \nmethods  with modern engineering. The DOR's division  offices throughout Nepal  use bioengineering in the \nconstruction, maintenance, and upgrading of all roads, especially in hilly and mountainous areas. \n15  ADB. 1997.

Both the DOR (for the road component) and CAAN (for the air transport component) \nhave sufficient capacity, past experience, and institutional strength to implement the facility. \nAlso, during implementation, both the DOR and CAAN will be supported by consultant services \nfor feasibility studies, detail design, bidding documents, and applicable social and environmental \ndue diligence. \n \n31.  Financial management.

The DOR has prior and ongoing experience with implementing \nADB-funded projects and has satisfactory capacity in terms of project financial accounting and \nknowledge of ADB disbursement procedures. Within the DOR\u2019s Project Directorate, the project \nimplementation  unit  for  the  road  transport  component,  there  will  be  a  dedicated  project \naccounting  and  finance  team  consisting  of  three  qualified  accountants:  a  chief  project \naccountant and two assistant accountants. \n \n32.  The CAAN operates with an adequate system of financial and management accounting, \nreporting, auditing, and internal controls. However, efficiency is weak due to inadequate staff \nresources  and  lack  of  a  computerized  information  system.  The  capacity  strengthening \ncomponent of ADB\u2019s recently approved Air Transport Capacity Enhancement Project will help \naddress this by introducing a financial management information system consisting of accounting \nsoftware,  networked  computers,  and  training  (footnote  6).  The  CAAN  will  assign  suitably \nqualified accountants (a chief project accountant and an assistant accountant) to the project \ncoordination unit for project accounting and financial management. \n \n33.  Both the DOR and CAAN will establish and maintain separate project records and \naccounts to identify the financing resources received and expenditures made for the facility, \nensuring an adequate audit trail. An independent auditor will annually audit the project accounts \nand related financial statements in accordance with international auditing standards. To further \nminimize any risks, ADB's direct payment procedure will be utilized for substantial disbursement \nof payments for works, goods, and consulting services. \n \n34.  Procurement  and  anticorruption.  The  government  has  promulgated  the  Public \nProcurement Act 2007 and Public Procurement Regulations 2007\u2014both generally acceptable to \nADB and encompassing best international procurement practices. These will be followed for \nnational procurement of goods and works, subject to the national competitive bidding annex in \nthe procurement plan. This annex documents clarifications and adjustments necessary for the \nnational systems to be used on ADB-financed contracts bid for under national competitive \nbidding procedures. As mandated by the act, the Public Procurement Monitoring Office has \nbeen assigned as an oversight agency for public procurement in Nepal. The Public Procurement \nMonitoring  Office,16 under  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  and  Council  of  Ministers,  is \nmandated, among other things, to make recommendations to the government for reform of the \nprocurement policy or laws, issue technical guidelines and manuals on procurement, prepare \nstandard  bidding  documents,  and  conduct  regular  training  programs  for  stakeholders.  The \ngovernment  is  strengthening  its  effort  to  fight  corruption  and  has  enacted  legislation  with \n                                                 \n16  ADB is providing technical assistance to strengthen the Public Procurement Monitoring Office in order to implement \nrequirements of the newly enacted act and regulations.

ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  CAAN.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (Appendix 2). The DOR and CAAN \nwill publish pertinent information relating to the facility on their websites, including business \nopportunities associated with the project, and information related to consulting services. \n \n36.  The  National  Vigilance  Centre  was  established  in  August  2002,  under  the  direct \nsupervision and control of the Prime Minister of Nepal, to create awareness against corruption \nand activities related to prevent corruption. Both the DOR and CAAN will appoint auditors \ncertified by the National Vigilance Centre to conduct a technical audit of the facility to examine \nhow well the objectives were met within the allocated time frame and budget. Technical audits \nwill be conducted during the implementation, assessing accomplishment that is mainly related to \ndesign quality, road safety audit implementation, schedule, and budget. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n37.  From  the  follow-on  transport  investments  prepared  under  the  proposed  facility,  the \nimproved  condition  and  higher  density  of  the  road  network  will  facilitate  delivery  of  social \nservices and access to shops, markets, schools, and hospitals, and help induce opportunities \nfor non-agriculture employment and incomes. \n \n38.  The  facility  is  not  expected  to  have  any  physical  impact  on  gender  and  social \ndimensions. Follow-on loans and grants will be prepared in compliance with ADB's Guidelines \nfor Incorporation of Social Dimensions in Projects and ADB's Handbook on Social Analysis.17 \nGender, consultation and participation, labor, HIV/AIDS, and other social risks relating to follow-\non loans and grants will be assessed, and mitigation plans will be prepared to address those \nissues. \n \n39.  The facility combines project feasibility study and detailed design, and safeguard due \ndiligence,  ensuring  that  (i)  follow-on  investment  projects  will  be  implemented  without \nunnecessary  delay,  and  (ii)  development  impact  of  the  follow-on  investment  projects  will \nmaterialize without delay. \n   \nE.  Safeguards \n40.  The facility is expected to ensure development of environmentally and socially viable \ninvestment loans. The follow-on loans and grant will be prepared in compliance with ADB's \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009) and government guidelines, regulations, and policies. The \nfacility is not expected to have any adverse social and environmental consequences due to the \nnature of the proposed intervention, i.e., project preparation. The safeguard categorization for \nthe facility is \u201cC\u201d for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples, respectively. \nDuring the feasibility studies, the consultants will prepare environmental impact assessments or \ninitial environmental examinations, including environmental management plans, for the selected \nsubprojects.  Similarly,  resettlement  planning,  indigenous  peoples  planning,  and  gender \n                                                 \n17  ADB. 1994.

Risks and Mitigating Measures \n41.  Major  risks  associated  with  implementing  the  facility  were  identified  and  practical \nmitigation measures were assessed as appropriate. To mitigate potential lack of oversight and \nguidance with respect to procurement, the Public Procurement Monitoring Office (footnote 16) \nwill carry out training for project implementation unit staff of the Departments of Roads and Civil \nAviation Authority of Nepal on technical guidelines and manuals, including refresher courses for \nthe  latest  ADB  procurement  guidelines  and  standard  bidding  documents.  To  enhance \nprocurement transparency, the Departments of Roads and Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal will \ndisclose information about the facility and business opportunities associated with the facility on \ntheir websites. To help deter corruption, auditors certified by the National Vigilance Centre will \nconduct a technical audit during the implementation, assessing accomplishment that is mainly \nrelated to design quality, road safety audit implementation, schedule, and budget. \n \n42.  The integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. Major risks and \nmitigating measures are described in the risk assessment and risk management plan.18 \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n43.  The government and CAAN have assured ADB that implementation of the facility shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n44.  The government and CAAN have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the facility, \nwhich are set forth in the grant agreement and project agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n45.  I am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  grant  not \nexceeding $12,000,000 to Nepal from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources for the Transport Project \nPreparatory Facility, on terms and conditions that are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft grant and project agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n05 October 2010 \n \n \n                                                 \n18  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (Appendix 2). \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions \nSummary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact  Percentage of population within  Ministry of Public Works  Assumption \nTransport connectivity  walking distance of paved  and Planning  Government \nis enhanced.  roads in 4 hours or less in hill    implements \nareas and 2 hours or less in    complementary \nTerai areas increases to 90%    investments to \nby 2018 (2007 baseline: 78%).    improve overall \n    transport network \nAnnual number of air  Civil Aviation Authority of   \npassengers increases by 75%  Nepal  Risk \nfor international travel and 55%  Air traffic volume \nfor domestic travel by 2018  is affected by the \n(2009 baseline: 1.6 million  global economy. \ninternational and 1.1 million \ndomestic passengers per year). \nOutcome  By project completion (2015),  Project performance  Assumption \nRoad and air  implementation gap of ADB- reports  The government \ntransport projects are  funded transport projects    remains \nimplemented  (interval period from approval  ADB country portfolio  committed to \nefficiently.  of loan and/or grant to award of  review reports  implementing the \n  first works contract) is    Priority \n  improved to 6 months (2009  Investment Plan \n  baseline: 27 months)  (2007\u20132016) for \n  development of \n  strategic roads. \nOutputs   By project completion (2015):   ADB missions  Assumption \n      Executing and \n1.
