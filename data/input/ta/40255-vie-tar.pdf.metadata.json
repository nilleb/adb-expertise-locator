The Government of Viet Nam has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nconsider financing a project for constructing two major bridges across the Mekong River at Cao \nLanh and Vam Cong in southern Viet Nam with access roads and an interconnecting road.1 The \nproposed project forms part of the Second Southern Highway (SSH) which connects Ho Chi \nMinh City (HCMC) through the central Mekong Delta region to the Southern Coastal Region, \nwhere it joins with the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Southern Coastal Corridor at Rach \nGia. During the Country Programming Confirmation Mission for the 2007 program for Viet Nam, \nthe Government requested ADB for technical assistance (TA) to assist in the preparation of the \nCentral Mekong Delta Region Connectivity Project. In the memorandum of understanding for \nthe mission it was agreed that a project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) for the project \nwould be included in ADB\u2019s nonlending program for 2007. \n2.  During 21\u201326 August 2007, a factfinding mission2 from ADB visited Viet Nam to discuss \nthe scope and implementation arrangements for the PPTA project. The purpose, scope, and \nimplementation  arrangements3  for  the  PPTA  project  were  agreed  in  a  memorandum  of \nunderstanding between ADB and the Ministry of Transport, signed on 24 August 2007. The \nGovernment has requested ADB to identify possible cofinancing on concessional terms and \npartial ADB funding from its Asian Development Fund resources for the ensuing project to \naugment the available budget and reduce future loan service. \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Viet Nam is currently experiencing rapid economic growth, based primarily on export \nprocessing industries and tourism. Between 2003 and 2007 gross domestic product (GDP) grew \nby an average of 8% per year, while exports in the same period grew by an average of about \n20%. The Mekong Delta region is the third-largest industrial center in the country after HCMC \nand  Hanoi,  and  is  based  primarily  on  agro-industry  and  other  light  industries.  Industrial \nproduction in the Mekong Delta region has accelerated in recent years, from an average annual \ngrowth rate of 13% in the period 2000\u20132004 to a growth rate of 24% in 2004\u20132005. Road traffic \nis growing rapidly in Viet Nam and a key constraint to future development is the availability of \nefficient transport infrastructure with adequate capacity to meet expanding demand. Between \n2000 and 2005, passenger traffic grew at an average rate of about 11% per year and freight \ntraffic at an average rate of about 12%. The Government is rapidly upgrading and expanding \nViet  Nam\u2019s  strategic  transport  infrastructure\u2014especially  highways,  railways,  and  ports\u2014to \nsupport sustained economic growth. As a result, transport infrastructure investments grew by \nabout 12% per year in fixed prices between 2000 and 2006.4 \n4.  ADB\u2019s strategy for the transport sector in Viet Nam5 identifies four key issues in the \ntransport sector: (i) low efficiency resulting in high transport costs; (ii) weak sustainability due to \ninsufficient  financing  and  weak  maintenance  planning;  (iii) increasing  transport  bottlenecks, \nwhich require innovative financing to be overcome; and (iv) poor road safety, with a fatality rate \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 14 November 2007. \n2  Comprising  Peter  Broch  (transport/project  economist,  team  leader),  Paul  Vallely  (senior  transport \nspecialist), and Le Dinh Thang (program/project implementation officer). \n3 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n4 Sources: Economist Intelligence Unit Country Report Vietnam, November 2007, and data from the \nGeneral Statistics Office of Vietnam. \n5 ADB. 2005. Viet Nam: Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008). Manila. \n ", "2   \nof about 10.9 deaths per 10,000 vehicles in 2003. In the same year, the fatality rate in Thailand \nwas about 5.2.6 \n5.  The Government is keenly aware of these issues and addresses them at several levels \nin  its  development  strategy.  The  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy \nrecognizes that development of the transport infrastructure is a necessary precondition for \ncontinued  economic  growth  and  identifies  two  main  needs:  (i) development  of  rural \ninfrastructure, including the rural and provincial road network, to create access and the basis for \nwidespread and equitable growth; and (ii) development of large-scale infrastructure to sustain \neconomic  growth.  The  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan  2006\u201320107  emphasizes  the \ngeneration of the economic growth that is required to attain the Millennium Development Goals \nand Viet Nam\u2019s own development goals. It recognizes regional cooperation as a key element in \nattaining  the  economic  growth  target  by  generating  additional  intraregional  trade  and \ninvestments.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  Transport  Sector  Development  Strategy  emphasizes  (i) targeting \nnational  and  international  financial  resources;  (ii) charging  users  of  infrastructure  (where \npossible) to accelerate infrastructure development and improve maintenance; (iii) encouraging \nprivate  sector  participation  in  infrastructure  development,  operation,  and  maintenance  to \nimprove efficiency; (iv) promoting safety and environmental sustainability in transport to reduce \nthe social and economic costs of transport; and (v) promoting modernization of infrastructure \nmanagement to improve resource allocation. \n6.  ADB\u2019s strategy in Viet Nam is the reduction of poverty through implementation of an \neconomic development strategy that is closely aligned to the Socio-Economic Development \nPlan and its targeted outcomes. The Transport Sector Roadmap in ADB\u2019s country strategy and \nprogram (2007\u20132010) for Viet Nam8 addresses the identified issues in three ways: (i) the first \naddresses  the  social  equity  aspects  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  transport  needs  by  supporting  the \ndevelopment of provincial and district networks; (ii) the second addresses critical transport \nneeds\u2014such as expressways, railways, and ports\u2014that constrain economic growth in the main \ndevelopment  centers  and  are  required  to  facilitate  the  efficient,  safe,  and  environmentally \nsustainable movement of goods and people; and (iii) the third complements the first two by \nbringing  subregional  dimensions  to  the  development  of  the  transport  network  in  terms  of \nconnectivity, including multimodal transport modes and competitiveness. The GMS Transport \nSector  Strategy9  supports  the  third  thrust  by  promoting  smooth  and  efficient  cross-border \nmovement of people and goods in an economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable \nmanner. \n7.  The  proposed  project  supports  these  strategies  in  several  ways:  (i) the  SSH  runs \nthrough the central parts of the Mekong River Delta to the west of, and roughly parallel with, the \nexisting National Highway 1A (NH1A), thereby providing a shortcut for traffic between HCMC, \nthe central Mekong Delta region, and the Southern Coastal Corridor, and connecting the highly \nproductive agro-industries in the central Mekong Delta region with important domestic and \nregional markets (notably HCMC and Bangkok) and with shipping ports for export; and (ii) the \nSSH will help alleviate high and rapidly growing traffic on NH1A, which passes several towns \nand cities and cannot be widened without very substantial social and economic impact. \n8.  The SSH passes the Tien Giang channel of the Mekong River at Cao Lanh, and the Hau \nGiang channel of the Mekong River at Vam Cong. The two crossings are currently served by \n                                                 \n6 ADB. 2005.

Manila (June). \n ", "  3\nsmall vehicle ferries, and the scope for expanding the capacity of the ferry services is limited. \nThe PPTA project will help remove this constraint by preparing a project for (i) the construction \nof two high bridges with a combined length of about 4,000 meters (m) to cross the channels,10 \n(ii) the construction of about 28 kilometers (km) of access roads including an interconnector \nroad between the two bridge sites, and (iii) the construction of toll plazas to collect bridge tolls. \nSimilar to the My Thuan Bridge on NH1A, the Government intends to collect road tolls at the \nproposed new bridge crossings to help defray the cost of constructing and maintaining the \nbridges. To provide the flexibility required to meet future traffic demand while keeping initial \ncosts down, the SSH will initially be built as a two-lane single carriageway but will be designed \nto expressway standard and will have sufficient right of way to enable future expansion to dual \ncarriageway expressway standard when required. At current traffic growth rates this will happen \nwithin 10 years. The proposed bridges will immediately be built as four-lane dual carriageway to \navoid construction activities disturbing the marine environment twice within a few years. The \nadditional cost of this is offset by avoiding the cost of constructing parallel bridges when the \nroad is widened. \n9.  A  number  of  project-specific  issues  have  been  identified  that  will  require  particular \nattention during project preparation. Financing debt service for new infrastructure from road tolls \nis often difficult in the early years after construction, where traffic typically is low and toll \nrevenues small. The design minimizes initial cost wherever practicable and the PPTA project \nincludes preparation of recommendations for structuring of the ensuing project\u2019s financing to \nminimize the need for Government subsidy. The northern sections of the SSH, from HCMC \ntowards the project bridges, are under construction but the southern extension to Rach Gia is \nonly at the planning stage with expected completion before 2020. This could constrain traffic in \nthe early years until that connection is completed, and could increase the need for Government \nsubsidies in the early years of operation. The bridges and the approach roads pass through \nproductive agricultural land and significant land acquisition and resettlement will be required. \nThe region is inhabited by a significant number of Khmers, who are a minority group and may \nrequire special attention during project design. These issues are explicitly addressed under the \nPPTA project. The Mekong Delta is a vulnerable environment and environmental management \nmust be in place during design and construction to ensure that natural water flows are not \nimpeded during or after construction and disturbance of the marine environment is minimized \nduring construction. Resolving these diverse issues will require extensive analysis to formulate \na project that optimally benefits Viet Nam as a whole and the population living in the Mekong \nDelta region in particular. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The  impact  of  the  ensuing  project  is  to  provide  a  more  efficient,  safe,  and \nenvironmentally friendly road transport system between HCMC, the project area and Rach Gia, \nand the GMS Southern Coastal Corridor. The project will provide adequate road capacity to \nsustain continued rapid economic growth in the Mekong River Delta. To achieve this impact, the \nproject will construct a section of the SSH (including the two bridges) in order to establish a \nhighway network in the region that can be expanded in step with economic development in \nfuture. \n                                                 \n10 The Mekong River is an international waterway under international treaty. The treaty specifies that the \nfree headway for passing vessels must be at least 37 m over the high water level. \n ", "4   \n11.  The purpose of the PPTA project is to finalize the project design to a level suitable for \nADB financing and agreed upon by the Government and ADB. The PPTA project will provide \nthe resources required to prepare the ensuing project and identify adequate mitigation of the \nsocial, resettlement, and other safeguard issues arising from the project. The PPTA project will \nreview and update the feasibility studies that the Government has prepared for the project. It will \ncarry out due diligence and propose modifications as required to ensure the feasibility of the \nproject while minimizing relevant safeguard concerns. The PPTA project will develop plans for \n(i)  mitigation  of  unavoidable  negative  impacts,  (ii)  monitoring  of  such  impacts,  and  (iii) \nmonitoring the effectiveness of mitigation. \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The PPTA project will be based on the feasibility studies and preliminary design reports \nprepared for the Ministry of Transport and approved by the prime minister. The PPTA project \nwill (i) carry out technical due diligence of the preliminary engineering design and update the \npreliminary  design  as  needed  to  produce  documentation  for  design-build  contract \ndocumentation; (ii) update the construction cost estimates to current price levels and prepare \nthese in ADB\u2019s standard format; (iii) review the scope for revenue from toll collection and \nprepare  preliminary  designs  for  toll  facilities;  (iv) prepare  financial  management  capacity \nassessment  and  procurement  review  of  the  implementing  agency  for  the  ensuing  project; \n(v) review  and  recommend  options  for  financial  structuring  of  the  project  to  minimize  the \nGovernment subsidy required for the project to meet payments of loan debt services and \noperation;  (vi) perform  economic  and  financial  analysis  to  ascertain  the  project\u2019s  viability, \nsubject  to  the  updated  project  cost  and  additional  works  identified  during  PPTA  project \npreparation;  (vii) identify  and  assess  subregional  economic  benefits;  (viii) prepare  bidding \ndocuments for a design-build contract for the bridges and the associated roads and facilities; \n(ix) address any equity, social and environmental issues associated with the project and its \nsubsequent  operation\u2014such  as  resettlement,  traffic  safety,  and  environmental  issues\u2014to \nensure that the ensuing project will not negatively affect the hydrological capacity of the Mekong \nRiver or otherwise degrade the project area during or after construction; and (x) prepare the \nenvironmental impact assessment for the project, a full resettlement plan, an ethnic minority \ndevelopment plan or an ethnic minority specific action (depending on the number of ethnic \nKhmer\u2019s affected), and design any other project interventions for monitoring and mitigation of \nnegative  impacts,  such  as  barrier  effects  arising  from  the  construction  and  subsequent \noperation of the project. Preparing mitigation will require environmental and social surveys and \nconsultation with affected people, local authorities, and nongovernment organizations. \n \n13.  Keys  objectives  of  the  PPTA  project  are  to  (i)  prepare  design-build  contract \ndocumentation in such a way that the final design imparts minimal negative impacts, thus \nminimizing the need for subsequent mitigation; and (ii) prepare plans to effectively monitor and \nmanage unavoidable negative impacts during construction and operation. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The  total  cost  of  the  PPTA  project  is  estimated  at  $1,000,000  equivalent.  The \nGovernment has requested that ADB finance $800,000 equivalent. The PPTA project will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The \nGovernment will finance $200,000 equivalent in local logistic support, counterpart staff, and \nother costs. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan is presented in Appendix 3. The \nGovernment has been informed that approval of the PPTA project does not commit ADB to \nfinance any ensuing project. \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n15.  The executing agency for the PPTA project will be the Ministry of Transport. The Viet \nNam  Road  Administration  will  implement  the  PPTA  project  through  the  My  Thuan  Project \nManagement  Unit  (PMU-MT).  The  PMU-MT  has  extensive  experience  with  implementing \nexternally funded projects, including the large My Thuan Bridge on the Mekong River (which \nwas financed by the Australian Government) and several completed and ongoing ADB-financed \nroad sector projects. The PMU-MT has the resources and experience required to effectively \nmanage the PPTA project and recruit the consultants. \n \n16.  An international consulting engineering firm will be engaged by ADB using simplified \ntechnical proposal and quality and cost-based selection, weighting the technical evaluation at \n80% and the financial evaluation at 20%. All recruitment will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The consultant will \nreview and develop the ensuing project and prepare the documents required for implementation \nof the project, including (i) bid documents for design-build contracts for the two bridges; (ii) the \nenvironmental impact assessment, a full resettlement plan, and an ethnic minority development \nplan; and (iii) drafts of the documents required for approval of the project by the Government of \nViet Nam and ADB. The PPTA project will require about 20 person-months of international \nconsultancy  services  and  about  30  person-months  of  national  consultancy  services  with \nexpertise in (i) bridge, road, hydrological, and geotechnical engineering; (ii) traffic, financial, and \neconomic analyses; (iii) environmental assessment and design; and (iv) resettlement planning. \nThe PPTA project is scheduled for initiation in March 2008 with completion in January 2009. \nOutline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 4. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Viet Nam for preparing the Central Mekong Delta Region Connectivity \nProject, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources/ \nDesign  Performance Indicators  Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  and Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nThe road subsector contributes primarily to poverty reduction by enabling sustained economic growth and by providing \nuniversal  access.  The  Government\u2019s  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy  (CPRGS)  emphasizes \ndevelopment  of  infrastructure  as  a  necessary  condition  for  economic  growth.  The  CPRGS  identifies  two  main  road \ninfrastructure development needs: (i) rural infrastructure to move towards universal accessibility, and (ii) development of large-\nscale infrastructure to sustain economic growth. Viet Nam\u2019s impressive economic growth has been pro-poor in the past, with \nonly marginal increases in inequality, while the proportion of people living below the total poverty line has halved from 58% in \n1993 to 29% in 2002. The proportion of people living below the food poverty line also halved, from 25% to about 13%, \nindicating that even the poorest segments of the population have benefited from economic growth. However, the incidence of \npoverty in Viet Nam is still high in rural areas, where about 35% of people live in poverty. Poverty used to be more pronounced \nin the project area than in Viet Nam on average, but this gap has been shrinking rapidly in the 10 years since economic \ndevelopment accelerated. Poverty is more prevalent in ethnic minorities than in the dominant Kinh majority. There is a \nsignificant Khmer minority in the Mekong Delta. \nB.     Targeting Classification \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention    Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n \nThe project is for construction of an expressway and two major bridges. It will improve the transport of people and cargo over \nmedium to long distances, which promotes general economic growth, but is only weakly linked with any particular group in \nterms of ethnicity, gender, income, social status, and geography. \nC.  Poverty Analysis4 \n1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed? n/a. \n2.  What resources are allocated in the PPTA/due diligence? About 3 person-months of international expert time, about 6 \nperson-months of national expert time, and budget for surveys are allocated for resettlement and ethnic minority planning. \nThis will be implemented by the PPTA consulting team. \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)? None. \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from the \nproject? Road transport users (passengers and cargo owners), producers, and consumers of products from the central \nMekong Delta region are the primary beneficiaries. \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? Road transport users will save time and \nmoney by having access to a shorter, faster, and more direct route, and by having the option to divert from congested \nroutes. These savings will reduce the costs of distribution which will benefit producers and consumers. \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project address \nthem? Access to the project area via the existing National Highway is a significantly longer journey than accessing via \nthe proposed project road. Traffic on the existing highway is approaching capacity which in future will lead to increasing \ncongestion. \n ", "Appendix 2  9\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. Landowners and dwellers within the proposed right of way who will need \ncompensation for land and resettlement. \n2. What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., workshops, \ncommunity mobilization, involvement of nongovernmental organizations and community-based organizations, etc.)? \nWorkshops and consultations related to land acquisition and resettlement. \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n     Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n4.  Will a C&P plan be prepared?    Yes          No    Consultations will be performed as part of resettlement. \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project/program? None \nidentified. \n \n2.  Does the proposed project/program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment by \nimproving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and participation in decision \nmaking?
