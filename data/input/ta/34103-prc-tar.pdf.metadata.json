INTRODUCTION\n1. During  the  2000  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s\nRepublic of China (PRC) confirmed its request for advisory technical assistance (TA) from the\nAsian Development Bank (ADB) for capacity building for a pilot build-operate-transfer (BOT)\nproject in the highway subsector, the proposed Jiangsu Highway BOT Project. The ADB Fact-\nfinding  Mission  visited  Beijing  and  Nanjing  from  22  to  31  August  2000  and  reached  an\nunderstanding  with  the  Government  on  the  objectives,  scope,  cost  and  implementation\narrangements for the TA.1 The TA framework is in Appendix 1.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. In recognition of the huge investment requirements for infrastructure development in the\nPRC, the Government has adopted a policy of promoting private investment in infrastructure.\nApart from increasing the resources available for infrastructure development, private investment\nallows a greater sharing of project risks and assists in improving the management efficiency and\nquality of infrastructure  services.\n3. In the last 10 years the PRC has embarked on a massive program of road development.\nA national trunk highway system of some 35,000 kilometers (km) is under implementation and\none third has been completed. An estimated $120 billion will be required for the highway\nprogram over the next five years, a sum that is beyond the resources of the public sector alone.\nSince the Highway Law became effective in 1998, virtually all new and many existing highways\nhave been tolled. This has provided support for private sector participation in the highway\nsubsector.\n4. To date, the cooperative joint venture model has been the dominant structure utilized for\nprivate highway financing. It is referred to as cooperative since the foreign investor receives a\npercentage of cash flow higher than its equity share during the early years of operation until its\nequity  investment  is  fully  paid  off,  and  less  over  the  following  years.  This  modality  has,\naccording to a recent World Bank study, been used in over 80 projects, representing some\n$11.4 billion in investments including $9 billion in private sector financing. Most deals have been\nnegotiated and implemented with foreign partners funding equity from their balance sheets.\nEquity financing is expensive and many arrangements have required public partner guarantees\nof  minimum  return  and  repayment  of  capital  and  tax  incentives.  This  model\u2019s  primary\ndisadvantage is the high cost, which is passed on to road users.\n5. Another  method  of  raising  private  capital  has  been  through  asset  securitization.\nProvincial highway companies have listed shares on the Hong Kong, China and Shenzhen\nstock exchanges. Some $1.6 billion equivalent has been raised in the past five years through\nlistings  backed  by  revenue  producing  highway  assets.  Securitization  is  undertaken  at  the\noperation stage, after certain project risks have been mitigated, including those related to\nconstruction, cost overruns, and initial traffic levels. The disadvantage of this financing modality\nis the time required to complete the regulatory formalities including, in the case of the Shenzen\nexchange, the requirements that companies must have three profitable years of operation\nbefore they can be listed. Consequently, this modality is more appropriate as a refinancing\ninstrument.\n                  \n1\nThe TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities  (Internet Edition) on 12 May 2000.", "2\n6. BOT remains a potential model whose effectiveness in the highway subsector has yet to\nbe proven. While different financing methods can be applied to BOT projects, it is an important\nmodel that differs from traditional government-sponsored structures by transferring risk to the\nprivate sector. The Government is encouraging wider use of the BOT modality for infrastructure\ndevelopment. It has developed a policy and regulatory framework to facilitate the formulation\nand award of a number of pilot BOT projects. The framework is expected to be ultimately\nformalized into a law dealing with BOT projects. Standard BOT concession agreements for the\npower, transport, and water supply sectors have been prepared by the State Development\nPlanning  Commission  (SDPC)  with  inputs  from  relevant  ministries  and  other  concerned\nagencies and with assistance from the United Nations Industrial Development Organization\n(UNIDO). The Government has been pursuing model projects in each of these sectors as\ndemonstration projects to provide sufficient experience to refine and finalize standard BOT\nconcession agreements and the prospective BOT law. Projects have been successfully financed\nin  the  power  and  water  sectors2,  the  latter  with  private  sector  financing  from  ADB.3  The\nproposed project has been identified by SDPC as a potential pilot BOT project in the highway\nsubsector.\n7. The proposed project constitutes the 80 km section in Jiangsu Province from Laohekou\nto Fuziling of the corridor connecting the two provincial capitals, Nanjing (Jiangsu Province) and\nHangzhou (Zhejiang Province) (map). This corridor is currently served by National Highway 104,\na Class II road, where the current traffic level is nearing capacity. The proposed project forms\npart of the triangle connecting Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hangzhou within one of the fastest\ngrowing regions in the PRC. It also provides an important link in the Shanghai-Ruili (Yunnan\nProvince) route of the national trunk highway system. The proposed project will be an access\ncontrolled expressway, comprising a 65 km six-lane southern section and a 15 km four-lane\nnorthern section. The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at Y3.5 billion ($422 million\nequivalent).\n8. The project preparatory work carried out by the Jiangsu authorities is at an advanced\nstage and has established the technical, financial, and economic viability of the proposed\nproject. A full feasibility study and a special financial feasibility study looking at the potential of\nthe BOT modality have been completed. The implementation of the proposed project will involve\nresettlement of about 1,500 families living on the right of way; a detailed resettlement plan has\nbeen prepared and is to be implemented by the local governments prior to the commencement\nof  construction.  An environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  report  has  been  prepared  and\napproved by the National Environment Protection Agency. Technical proposals will have to\nsatisfy the environmental requirements specified in the EIA Report.\n9. The  proposed  project  is  expected  to  have  good  prospects  for  BOT  financing  (see\nselection criteria in Appendix 2). The proposed financing structure envisages debt as well as\nequity financing. To mitigate the foreign exchange risk, domestic financing is expected to be\nsought by the winning project sponsor. The 2005 opening year traffic is forecast at 25,000\nvehicles per day, and expected to grow in the initial years at 8 percent per annum. The\nconcession period proposed is 25 years, including a 3-year construction period. The structuring\nof the proposed project will need to be carefully reviewed to maximize the interest of the private\n                  \n2  The first pilot BOT project was the Laibin B Power Project in Guangxi Autonomous Region. The second was the\nChengdu Water Supply Project in Sichuan province.\n3  Loan 7152/1662-PRC: Chengdu Generale des Eaux-Marubeni Waterworks Company Ltd., for $26.5 Million,\napproved on 11 February 1999.", "3\nsector. The Government is considering including the operation and management of the parallel\nnational highway in the concession and the possibility of constructing a portion of the proposed\nalignment as its contribution.\n10. ADB  supports  the  Government\u2019s  policy  of  encouraging  local  and  foreign  private\ninvestment to meet infrastructure needs. ADB TA to the power and water sectors has provided\ngood  experience  with  the  BOT  modality.4  In  the  highway  subsector,  ADB  has  provided\nassistance to assess a broad range of financial instruments for mobilizing additional domestic\nand  international  resources,  including  from  the  domestic  capital  markets.5  ADB  has  also\nprovided assistance for (i) capacity building in relation to BOT processes and preparing a\nfeasibility study for a highway BOT scheme;6 and (ii) developing institutional capacity to promote\ncorporatization,  leasing,  and  securitization.7  In  addition  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Group  has\nmobilized $123.4 million of private sector equity financing for seven road projects in the PRC.\n11. The TA is a logical follow-on assistance by ADB to build the capacity of the Government\nagencies involved in the implementation of BOT projects in the highway subsector and to\npromote transparency and competition in the selection of project sponsors. The highway BOT\nmodality is a challenging area where, in line with its Private Sector Development Strategy, ADB\ncan play a catalytic role through advisory TA and possibly a private sector operation. The\nexperience gained will help refine the standard BOT concession agreement and formalize the\nlegal and regulatory framework essential to build the confidence of investors and lenders. The\nsuccessful implementation of the TA is expected to promote more transparency and increased\nprivate sector investment in the subsector. Such investment will indirectly contribute to ADB\u2019s\noverarching goal of poverty reduction by freeing up public financial resources that can instead\nbe utilized for the Government's social and equity programs.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objective\n12. The objective of the advisory TA is to strengthen the capacity of national and provincial\nagencies  in  the  processing  of  BOT  infrastructure  projects  following  competitive  bidding\nprocedures and international best practice. Using the proposed Jiangsu Highway BOT Project\nas a pilot case study for the highway subsector, the TA will help in marketing the project,\nstructuring it for the BOT modality, preparing the bidding documents for the selection of the\nproject sponsor, evaluating the bids received, and negotiating with the most competitive bidder.\nThe resulting refinements in the bidding and evaluation process will help develop a model for\nfuture  BOT  highway  projects  in  the  PRC  and  finalize  the  enabling  legal  and  regulatory\nframework.\n                  \n4  TA 2730-PRC: BOT Changsha Power, for $600,000, approved on 23 December 1996, and TA 2804-PRC: BOT\nChengdu Water Supply, for $600,000, approved on 2 June 1997.\n5 TA 2409-PRC: Appraisal Methodologies and Restructuring Highway Financing in Hebei Province, for $740,000,\napproved on 28 September 1995.\n6  TA 2649-PRC: Facilitating Build-Operate-Transfer Mobilization in the Highway Sector, for $1.1 million, approved on\n27 September 1996. The resulting feasibility study for the Yangjiang-Dianbai expressway in Guangdong Province\nconcluded that the BOT project was not viable because of high risks associated with the traffic forecast.\n7  TA 2952-PRC: Corporatization, Leasing, and Securitization in the Road Sector, for $1.0 million, approved on\n19 December 1997.", "4\nB.  Scope\n13. The TA will involve:\n(i)  a review of all aspects of the detailed feasibility work that has been undertaken\nfor the proposed project including engineering, financial and economic analyses,\nrisk assessment and environmental impact assessment, and provision of advice\nregarding  the  structuring  of  the  proposed  BOT  project  and  the  Government\nsupport required in order to best attract the private sector;\n(ii)  an examination of the resettlement and social impacts of the proposed project to\nensure  conformity  with  national  guidelines  and  ADB\u2019s  policies  on  social\ndimensions and involuntary resettlement;\n(iii)  a review of the bidding documents to be issued for the proposed project to\nincorporate best international practice and the findings of the feasibility review;\n(iv)  assistance with the marketing of the proposed project to prospective project\nsponsors and investors and assistance with the evaluation of the prequalification\nsubmissions;\n(v)  support and advice to the project authorities during the prebid meeting with the\npotential bidders, in the evaluation of bids received, during negotiations with the\nfirst ranked bidder, and in finalizing the concession agreement to be signed with\nthe  successful  bidder.  Such  assistance  will  cover  technical,  commercial,\nfinancial, and legal aspects; and\n(vi)  provision  of  an  in-country  training  program  for  the  project  officials  on  the\nconcepts and methodologies for the bidding and implementation of BOT projects.\n14. Outline terms of reference for the consultants to be engaged under the TA are given in\nAppendix 3.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n15. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $725,000 equivalent, comprising $497,000 in\nforeign  exchange  and  $228,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  ADB  will  provide  $555,000\nequivalent on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded from the Government of\nJapan, to meet $497,000 of the foreign exchange costs and $58,000 equivalent of the local\ncurrency  costs  to  finance  domestic  consultants  and  local  expenses.  The  Government  will\nfinance  the  remaining  $170,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs  including  provision  of\ncounterpart staff, technical support, local transport, office facilities, and translation. Detailed cost\nestimates and financing arrangements are presented in Appendix 4.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n16. For the overall management of the proposed project implementation, a leading group\nunder the chairmanship of the Vice Governor of Jiangsu Province is to be established. The\nleading group will comprise representatives of the Jiangsu Development Planning Commission,\nJiangsu Provincial Communications Department, and other agencies. A BOT office will be\nestablished to manage the day-to-day implementation of the proposed project including the", "5\npreparation of project documents (prequalification and bidding documents) and the overall BOT\nbidding process. Evaluation and negotiating teams will be established to evaluate the bids\nreceived and negotiate with the successful bidder, respectively. BOT International Engineering\nDevelopment Company Ltd., an independent PRC consulting firm, has been engaged to review\nthe financial feasibility of the proposed project, prepare the bidding documents, and support the\nBOT office and the special teams.\n17. For the TA implementation, SDPC will be the Executing Agency and the BOT office will\nbe the Implementing Agency. SDPC will chair a steering committee, with representatives from\nthe Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Communications, and Jiangsu Provincial Government, to\nprovide policy advice and guidance. The BOT office will be responsible for the day-to-day\nimplementation of the TA and the provision of counterpart staff and support for the TA.\n18. A team of international and domestic consultants will be engaged using a simplified\ntechnical proposal in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other\narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The\ninternational consultants, with a total input of 12 person-months, will have core expertise in\nprivate sector infrastructure, with focus on commercial aspects and project finance; law, with a\nfocus  on  concessions  and  bidding  documents  for  private  sector  projects;  and  highway\nengineering, with BOT experience. The consultants will have experience in the evaluation and\nnegotiation of private sector transport projects. Expertise in environmental and social impact\nassessment will also be required. The domestic consultants, with a total input of 8 person-\nmonths, will have expertise in commercial and financial aspects of infrastructure projects, and\nPRC law.\n19. The  TA  will  be  carried  out  in  four  phases.  Under  phase  I,  project  marketing  and\nprequalification support will be provided; the bidding documents for the proposed project will be\nreviewed together with the review of the feasibility studies and engineering design, the EIA\nreport,  and  the  resettlement  plan  for  the  proposed  project.  A  computerized  model  for  the\nfinancial evaluation of the bids will also be developed during this phase. In phase II, assistance\nwill be provided to the project authorities in the prebid meeting with the potential bidders.\nAssistance in the evaluation of the bids received will be the main task of the consultants under\nphase Ill. In phase IV, the consultants will assist in the negotiations with the successful bidder,\nand in the finalization of project agreements. The in-country training program will be conducted\nprior to the commencement of phase Ill. Full use will be made of the work carried out so far in\nthese  areas  under  the  earlier  TAs  provided  by  ADB,  the  World  Bank,  UNIDO,  and  other\norganizations. The consultants will submit reports at the end of each phase of the work. The\nfinal report on the completion of the TA work will summarize the bidding experience for the\nproposed project, and provide recommendations on how the bidding systems and procedures\nfor  BOT  highway  projects  could  be  further  improved.  Tripartite  meetings  involving  the\nGovernment,  ADB,  and  the  consultants  will  be  held  (i)  within  six  weeks  of  TA  inception,\n(ii) following the evaluation of the bidding documents, and (iii) following negotiation with the first-\nranked bidder. The work on the TA is expected to commence in March 2001, and be completed\nin 18 months by September 2002.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION\n20.
