The Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund (PRCF) peer review meeting on 28 June 2004 \nendorsed a project proposal to reduce poverty caused by and linked to psychosocial health \nproblems associated with the conflict in Sri Lanka.1 Sri Lanka is emerging from two decades of \ncivil conflict. It has acutely debilitated the population and economy. The Country Strategy and \nProgram (CSP) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) (2004\u20132008)2 and its update (CSPU, \n2005\u20132006)3 strongly support the Government's efforts to reconstruct and develop Sri Lanka. \nThe CSP and CSPU target pro-poor economic growth, with emphasis on backward and conflict-\naffected regions or on those facing particular hardships. The technical assistance (TA) will \nsupport the Government's program to increase conflict survivors\u2019 access to social services. In \nparticular, mental health disorders are prevalent and chronic among the conflict survivors. Given \nthe scale of the problem, the Government has requested ADB to help build the capacity to \naddress the mental health of conflict-affected people. \n \n2.    The TA Fact-Finding Mission visited Sri Lanka\u2014including Batticaloa, one of the conflict-\naffected areas\u2014from 16 to 20 August 2004, to discuss with the Government and stakeholders \n(i) external funding coordination, (ii) TA scope, (iii) implementation arrangements, (iv) cost \nestimates, (v) financing plan, and (vi) outline terms of reference for experts.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Mental health disorders are common in developing and developed countries, and are \nconsidered one of the top 10 causes of disability. According to the World Health Report 2001,4 \nmental health problems account for 12% of the global burden of disease. Health problems are \ndisabling, costly, and often push families into poverty.  \n \n4.  War and conflict are often linked with post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSDs) and other \npsychosocial  diseases,  and  conflict-affected  persons  often  require  long-term  treatment.  A \ngrowing body of research shows that these problems are prevalent and chronic. Mental health \nproblems caused by the trauma of war and conflict linger and must be solved if the victim is to \nreturn to  good health. Failure to address psychosocial disorders in populations that have \nexperienced mass violence and trauma caused by conflict can (i) leave the society vulnerable to \na return to violence, and (ii) inhibit efforts to rebuild social capital and social and economic \ndevelopment.   \n \n5.  After 20 years of conflict and repeated efforts to resolve it and achieve lasting peace, a \nbreakthrough was achieved in February 2002. The Government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation \nTigers of Tamil Eelam signed a cease-fire agreement, which, despite increasing violations, is \nstill officially supported by both sides. In April however, the change in Government brought the \npeace process to a standstill.  \n \n6.  During the conflict, more than 60,000 people were killed and over 1 million displaced. \nWhen the  cease-fire agreement  was signed, many of the displaced lived in one of the 349 \nGovernment and external agency-financed welfare centers, although about half of the displaced \nhave now returned to their places of origin. Returnees and those who remain in the welfare \ncenters face difficult living conditions. \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 5 July 2004. \n2  ADB. 2003. Country Strategy and Program (2004\u20132008): Sri Lanka. Manila. \n3  ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program Update (2005\u20132006): Sri Lanka. Manila. \n4  World Health Organization (WHO). 2002. World Health Report 2001. Geneva.  ", "2  \n7.  All  these  circumstances,  among  other  problems,  have  led  to  a  sharp  increase  in \npsychosocial disorders in the country. An entire range of mental disorders and their symptoms \nwere found. Most notably, suicide and drug abuse have become more prevalent. The following \nfigures illustrate the situation: \n \n(i)  Suicide is an alarming problem. The country ranks seventh in world suicide \nstatistics. The suicide rate among male Sri Lankans is over 40.0 per 100,000 \n(India 12.2, Philippines 2.5).5 \n(ii)  Over 70,000 patients are admitted annually to state hospitals for poisoning, \nwhich, in most cases, are attempted suicides. Twelve percent die. \n(iii)  Studies  focusing  on  the  conflict-affected  areas  reveal  that  27.6%  of  the \npopulation suffers from severe PTSDs. \n(iv)  The rate of severe psychiatric diseases has risen by 14% between 1980 and \n2000. \n(v)  The chronically ill, together with those severely traumatized by war, represent \nabout 3\u20135% of the population of the northeast. They urgently need services but \nfacilities were either damaged in the conflict or are overcrowded. \n(vi)  Recent studies6 show that 10% of the population is in urgent need of counseling. \nAbout 60% of the population in the north and east (the war-affected zones) \nneeds psychosocial support services. \n \n8.  Displacement, violence, urbanization, migration, social and economic pressures, and \ntrauma have exacerbated psychological distress, leading to a loss of social cohesion and social \ncapital. Evidence is strong that poverty and psychosocial health are linked in many ways. \nPeople traumatized by war are usually those who lose their homes and their livelihood. Many \nfamilies lose their breadwinner, and children lose their parents. \n \n9.  Activities to cope with PTSDs and other mental disorders are important. This project \nmeets  an  urgent  demand  in  developing  member  countries,  and  ADB  support  is  crucial. \nCommunity psychosocial health programs have been proven to be effective in treating mental \nhealth problems in poor populations.    \n \n10.  Among the hundreds of  nongovernment organizations (NGOs) in Sri Lanka, 24 are \nworking in psychosocial services for children affected by the conflict and operate counseling \ncenters using community based approach. The main players are the United Nations Children's \nFund (UNICEF) and German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ), both working with \ntraumatized children on a large scale, covering primary and secondary schools in the whole \nnortheast  of  the  country.  Privately  funded  NGOs  like  Sahanaya  have  significantly  helped \nimprove services, and Government agencies hold activities in most provinces. Among the NGO \nand Government programs are mass media initiatives and school-based educational efforts. \nSeveral are directed specifically at the police, armed forces members, and prison officials. \nHowever, NGOs face serious financial and capacity constraints and need assistance to improve \ntheir service delivery. Many activities, especially of UNICEF and GTZ, focus on children, and \nservices for adults are few. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n11.  The Project\u2019s overall goal is to reduce poverty caused by and linked to psychosocial \nhealth problems associated with the conflict. The Project\u2019s purpose is to pilot-test the provision \nof services to people affected by psychosocial health problems. \n                                                 \n5  WHO. 2003. WHO Suicide Rates. Available:  http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/suicide/suiciderates/en/ \n6  Simms, Chris. 2002. Psychosocial Distress in Sri Lanka\u2014A Needs Assessment Using Livelihood Approach. Colombo. ", "  3\n12.  The TA will focus on psychosocial health problems in the context of poverty. Many of the \nmentally ill are displaced, unemployed, victims of violence, or have lost their families. The main \nTA output will be to develop and pilot-test an approach to help mentally ill people, their families, \nand communities by providing services like counseling, awareness creation, medical service, \ntraining of staff, and institutional development. Service delivery will rely wherever possible on \nNGOs. The principles of the TA are (i) community-based participatory approach, (ii) working \nwith people with psychosocial health problems as \"agents\" for change, instead of \"victims,\" (iii) \neffective services for both adults and children, (iv) public-private partnership, and (v) service \ndelivery that includes establishing links with economic opportunities. \n \nB.   Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The TA methodology follows a phased approach, with a preparatory study and a project \nimplementation phase, an evaluation, and identification of up-scaling potentials. The TA will thus \nhave four components: \n \n14.  Component 1: Background, Baseline, and Design Study. Under this component, the \nbackground of psychosocial health problems in the context of poverty in Sri Lanka will be \nanalyzed and possible activities developed. An outline of the feasibility study is in Appendix 2. \nThe activities will include the following: \n \n(i)  Develop a methodological framework. \n(ii)  Assess studies and activities on psychological health problems and poverty, and \nthe  situation  of  the  target  group,  especially  the  context  and  reasons  for \npsychosocial health problems, emphasizing the link between psychosocial health \nproblems and poverty. \n(iii)  Consult with target groups (e.g., focus group discussions). \n(iv)  Assess the services available to the mentally ill. \n(v)  Analyze how psychosocial health is being handled in the community. \n(vi)  Identify the victims and the effects of their illness on families and communities \n(i.e., the \u201cTarget Groups\u201d). \n(vii)  Prepare a strategy on how to help the target groups, using existing structures, \ncommunities, and networks. \n(viii)  Analyze the needs for capacity building, community development, and financing.  \n(ix)  Identify ADB\u2019s comparative advantage in this area.  \n \n15.  At the end of component 1, the benefits and costs of the proposed pilot project will be \nassessed. A detailed work plan and costing for component 2 will be prepared. The terms of \nreference for NGOs and a set of criteria for choosing NGOs and other agencies will also be \nprepared. The work plan, costing, terms of reference for NGOs and selection criteria will be \napproved by ADB. \n \n16.  Component 2: Pilot Programs. Based on the program of activities recommended in \ncomponent 1, different types of programs and services to help the Target Groups will be \nimplemented under component 2, which may include elements such as training of professionals, \ninstitutional development, and payment of lump sum to  finance service delivery. The project \nteam will cooperate with NGOs. The services will be delivered to the victims, their families, and \ncommunities, and may comprise counseling, awareness raising in the community and among \nprofessionals, medical support, job creation, and improving institutions that deliver the support. \nWays to (i) strengthen the local governments\u2019 impact on Target Groups, and (ii) achieve \nsustainability of the pilot-tested services will also be explored. Component 2 will seek to provide \nservices to Target Groups that do not currently have access to such services and to improve \nservices to Target Groups that do have access to some form of such services. ", "4  \n \n17.  Component 3: Evaluation. Components 1 and 2 will be documented, assessed, and \nevaluated in a report. Lessons learned will be identified to determine the potential for scaling-up \nthe TA to a larger Project. If the Pilot Program under component 2 improves services and key \nindicators such as the poverty ratio and psychosocial health (especially suicide rates), ADB may \nconsider a larger investment or sector project. \n \n18.  Component 4:  Advocacy and Partnership Development. Toward the end of the \nProject,  the  report  reflecting  the  findings  of  component  3  will  be  shared  with  the  key \nstakeholders in a national workshop, and follow-up actions, including co-financing in ensuing \nloan projects, will be considered.  \n \n19.  TA consultants will thoroughly analyze the outputs of Components 1\u20133 and the views of \nstakeholders, discuss the findings with stakeholders, and recommend ways to improve the basic \nconditions for psychosocial services. The consulting services will carry out a baseline and \nfeasibility study, including a project design for the pilot phase (component 2). Following are \nsome key issues to be reviewed by the consultants: (i) psychosocial health prevalence, (ii) \navailable services, (iii) existing gaps, (iv) services to be provided under component 2, (v) \nselection criteria for NGOs, (vi) mechanisms for community involvement, and (vii) community \ninvolvement and public-private partnerships (public service and NGOs). The specialists will \ndevelop a way to improve community services, especially on how to develop and strengthen \ntheir delivery. The specialists will assess the possibilities of further cooperation with other \ndevelopment partners, especially UNICEF and GTZ.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n20.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000 equivalent, of which ADB will finance $400,000, \ncovering the entire foreign exchange cost of $73,000 and $327,000 equivalent of the local \ncurrency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation \nFund, funded by the Government of the United Kingdom, to be administered by ADB. ADB will \nfinance  the  pilot  services,  consulting  services,  production  of  reports,  workshops,  and \nadministration support services. The Government contribution of $100,000, equivalent in kind, \nwill cover office accommodation, counterpart staff, and transport (Appendix 3). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  The Project will last 36 months, from January 2005 to December 2007. Component 1 will \nlast 4 months, and the remaining components 32 months. The Executing Agency will be the \nMinistry of Women Empowerment and Social Welfare. The implementing agency will be an \nNGO. The steering committee, which will advise and oversee the Project, will be constituted by \nmembers from Government agencies, stakeholders, and development partners (UNICEF and \nGTZ).  \n \n22.  The Government will appoint a project director and designate counterpart staff to work \nwith the consultants. A project office for the consulting team will be established after TA signing. \nThe office will have utilities, furniture, and local telephone services.  \n \n23.  Component 1 will use the services of an international psychosocial health expert (2 \nperson-months) and a domestic community development and social participation specialist (4 \nperson-months). All consultants will be recruited individually, in accordance with the Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants by the ADB and Its Borrowers and other arrangements satisfactory to \nADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 4. \n ", "  5\n24.  Components 2, 3, and 4 will be implemented through an NGO. It will be selected by \nADB\u2014taking  into  account  proposals  made  by  the  Government\u2014in a competitive bidding \naccording to criteria developed in component 1 and in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants by the ADB and Its Borrowers and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB \nfor  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  Pilot  districts  under  component  2  will  be \nTrincomalee (Eastern Province) and Monaragala (Uva Province). \n \n25.  The consulting services will be carried out over 4 months, from December 2004 to March \n2005. The consulting team will submit an inception report within 2 weeks from the start of the \nTA, the draft final report in the first week of the fourth month, and the final report within 4 months \nfrom the start of the TA. The TA will include field visits, stakeholder mapping and participatory \nplanning  to  facilitate  consensus  building  among  a  wide  range  of  stakeholders  such  as \ndevelopment partners, NGOs, health staff, and political and administrative leaders at various \nlevels. The consultants will organize at least one workshop in Colombo and one workshop in \neach  district  to  solicit  views  and  discuss  options  and  activities  with  stakeholders.  The \nconsultants  will  prepare  a  self-standing  project  concept,  which  will  be  implemented  in \ncomponent 2. The consultants will develop criteria to select the implementing NGOs and \nprepare the bidding process.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n26.  The President acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 to the Government \nof Sri Lanka to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund for the \nPsychosocial Health in Conflict-Affected Areas Project, and hereby  reports this action to the \nBoard.
