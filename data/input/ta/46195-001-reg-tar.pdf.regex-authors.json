INTRODUCTION \n1.    Years of rapid growth allowed developing Asia and the Pacific to make massive strides \nin poverty reduction. However, the region remains home to about two-thirds of the world's poor, \nwith 1.7 billion of its population living on less than $2 a day, and 828 million struggling on less \nthan $1.25 a day. A recent Asian Development Bank (ADB) study1 also shows that, despite the \nregion\u2019s many successes, inequality in the region is rising, creating a new rich\u2013poor social and \neconomic divide. Widespread poverty and unequal income distribution necessitate public sector \nintervention, a common avenue for which is provision of public services for the poor. Indeed, \npublic  spending  and service  delivery  are the most  direct  means  of government  activity  to \ninfluence  development.  But  such  redistribution  policies  cannot  be  effective  without  good \ngovernance. Empowering the people is a powerful way to improve governance for effective \nservice delivery. Progressive allocation of benefits from public expenditures requires not only an \naccountable government and competitive markets but also community participation and strong \nvoice of the people.  \n \n2.    Good governance has been adopted as a policy by governments and development \ninstitutions alike. In 1995, ADB was the first multilateral development bank to adopt a special \npolicy on governance.2 Over the years, related approaches were adopted to broaden and \nstrengthen ADB's governance work, including governance as one of the three pillars of ADB's \npoverty reduction strategy in 20043 and approval of the second Governance and Anticorruption \nAction  Plan  (GACAP  II)  in  2006..4 ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020,  implemented  in  2008,  identifies \ngovernance as a key driver of change5 The purpose of this technical assistance (TA) is to \nunderstand, synthesize, and articulate key policy challenges and opportunities related to the \nprovision of public services in Asia and the Pacific, as well as to contextualize the role and \nimportance of the government in providing services when people are empowered. Findings from \nthe TA will guide policy makers in designing more efficient and effective public programs and in \nenhancing  the  long-term  inclusive  growth  potential  of  public  policy.  The  TA  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.6 \n   \nII.  ISSUES \n3.    Although  governments  in  the  region  spend  substantial  sums  on  health,  education, \nnutrition,  and  other  public  services,  the  expenditure  often  does  not  reach  the  poor,  while \nmisallocation of public funds is widespread and diversion of these funds into private pockets is \ncommon.  Lack  of  transparency  and  voice  of  the  people  influence  both  the  supply  of  and \ndemand for public services. Publicly funded schools in the region are often characterized by \ninadequate infrastructure, teacher absenteeism, lack of textbooks, and poor sanitation, resulting \nin low school enrolment, partial attendance, limited participation by girls, and poor quality of \neducation. Similarly, dilapidated buildings, perennial shortage of basic drugs, lack of qualified \nmedical personnel in public health centers, and long distances to hospitals perpetuate high \ninfant  and  maternal  mortality  rates,  low  life  expectancy,  and  large  private  out-of-pocket \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2012.

Poor performance of other public services such as power and water supply and \nsubsidized food programs for the poor hinge on governance issues (often referred to as the \nAchilles heel, a vital weak point that can undermine the overall strength of the program). Weak \ninstitutions; low levels of accountability; and country-specific economic, social, political, and \nhistorical dynamics of development influence the quality of public service delivery. Indeed, there \nis  a  developing  body  of  empirical  evidence  regarding  the  link  between  governance, \nempowerment and public service delivery. 7 \n \n4.    Introducing  minimum  service  standards  is  one  approach  to  specifying  expectations \nregarding public service delivery. Moreover, most member states of the International Labour \nOrganisation have voted for the Recommendation for \u201cSocial Protection Floors\u201d (SPF) as a new \ninternational labor standard.8 The national social protection floors, reflecting national objectives, \neconomic and fiscal capacities, provide basic social security guarantees, including effective \naccess to essential health care and basic income security that contribute to preventing or \nalleviating poverty, vulnerability and social exclusion. Institutionalizing SPF is a novel approach \nto  empowering  the  people.  While  Nobel  Laureate  Amartya  Sen\u2019s  \u201centitlement  approach\u201d \nprovides  a  framework  for  studying  empowerment  through  the  relationship  between  rights, \ninterpersonal obligations, and individual entitlements, the SPF presents an applicable policy \napproach towards realizing individuals\u2019 human rights to social security and social services. \n \n5.    It is being increasingly recognized that higher transparency through empowerment of the \npeople can improve the provision of public services. Empowerment gives people the rights and \nfreedom to make decisions in matters that affect their lives, hold others accountable for their \npromises, and influence development in their communities or even in a wider region. Civil \nsociety, the private sector, and the media can play important roles in obtaining information, \nrationale, and explanations for the use of government funds. Transparency and access to \ninformation on public expenditures can reduce the capture of public funds by government \nofficials and politicians. In the words of Nobel Laureate Wangari Maathai, \u201cInequity and power \nimbalances, adverse employment conditions and the lack of economic opportunities or control \nover assets are all manifestations of peoples\u2019 disempowerment and contribute to their poverty.\u201d9  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n6.    This TA will examine the role of empowerment for better delivery of public services. In \nparticular, it will analyze how increased transparency of the public sector and empowerment of \nthe poor through greater information dissemination and increased awareness of their rights \ncould be used for effective and efficient provision of public services in Asia and the Pacific.  \n7.    The issue of governance covers a wide spectrum, including political governance (relating \nto constitutions, political systems, and government structures), economic governance (relating \nto public policies and institutions to support economic activity), democratic governance (relating \n                                                \n7  See, e.g., OECD (2012), Poverty Reduction and Pro-Poor Growth: The Role of Empowerment, OECD Publishing. \nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264168350-en; Global Monitoring Report 2011: Improving the Odds of Achieving the \nMDGs, World Bank, International Monetary Fund; and World Bank. 2011.

Under this TA, the wider governance issues will be discussed to \nprovide  a  context,  and  following  this  will  focus  on  economic  governance,  with  a  special \nemphasis on delivery of public services, which is the most potent form of government action to \ninfluence development, sustain growth, and reduce poverty. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.    The impact will be that the study will influence the formulation and implementation of \npolicies  on  public  service  provision  in  several  developing  member  countries  (DMCs).  The \noutcome will be that the policy lessons derived from the study will be referred to by policy \nmakers, development practitioners, and other stakeholders. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.    The study will provide a platform for detailed analyses and evidence-based solutions \nspecific to developing Asia and the Pacific, with concrete and practical policy recommendations, \ne.g., improvements in rights to information, participatory approaches and community-driven \ndevelopment as avenues for improving public service delivery. It will draw on, articulate, and \nsynthesize lessons from studies of international experience, including in Asia and the Pacific, on \ngovernance issues that governments face in providing public services. To ensure that the \nproject will not just be repetition of previous work done, it will build on existing studies and \nreports including those produced by ADB and examine their relevance to ADB DMCs. The need \nfor specific country-based examples will be determined in the course of implementation through \nproject team discussions.  \n \n10.   The main products of this TA will be (i) a policy report, Empowering the People for \nEffective Public Service Delivery, to be released during the 2013 annual meeting of ADB in \nDelhi; and (ii) an edited book, Transparency for Effective Public Service Provision in Developing \nAsia and the Pacific. The policy report will examine the role of empowerment of the poor for \neffective  provision  of  public  services  in  Asia and  the  Pacific. The  book  will  discuss  wider \ngovernance  issues  and  then  focus  on  economic  governance  for  better  delivery  of  public \nservices, building on policy issues presented in the policy report. An electronic version of the \nbook will be uploaded to the ADB website.  \n \n11.   Workshops, seminars, and conferences will be organized to inform governments and \nother  stakeholders  and  disseminate  the  findings  of  the  TA  for  guiding  policy  reforms.  An \ninception workshop, to which high-caliber resource persons, leading experts, and policy makers \nwill be invited, will discuss in depth the research problems to be tackled, the sectors to be \ncovered, the analytical framework to be used, and the study methodology to be applied. Ways \nto address the data issues and problems that might affect the extent of the analysis will also be \ndiscussed in the workshop. Government concurrence from the Government of India has been \nrequested for the launching of the policy report in one of the seminars in the ADB annual \nmeeting. No in-country activities are envisaged in other DMCs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.   The TA is estimated to cost $850,000; which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013IV). The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \n ", "4   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.   ADB will be the executing agency and will implement the TA through  collaboration \nbetween the Macroeconomics and Finance Research Division of the Economics and Research \nDepartment,  the  Governance  Community  of  Practice,  the  Regional  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment Department, and the Independent Evaluation Department. The collaboration will \nbe in the form of co-authorship of chapters and sections, peer review, and provision of inputs. \nThe TA is expected to commence in October 2012 and be completed by June 2014. \n \n14.   The TA will require 33 person-months of inputs from international experts in economics, \ngovernance, public finance and other related subjects to contribute to selected chapters of the \npolicy report and the book. Up to 10 resource persons will be engaged to review the chapters \nprepared by ADB staff and consultants and to participate as discussants in the workshops and \nconferences. National economics, governance, public finance and other related subject experts \nwill be hired for 3 person-months to prepare country case studies on specific issues. National \nresearch analysts will be hired for 15 person-months to assist in the TA research work. To \nprepare and finalize the manuscripts for publication that adheres to ADB style, usage, and \nformat, a copy editor will be hired for 3 person-months and a graphics designer will be hired for \n3 person-months to typeset and convert the files into the required format. The TA will engage \nindividual consultants.10 The Economics and Research Department will coordinate with the \nDepartment of External Relations on the publication of the report and the book. The outline \nterms of reference for consultants and resource persons are provided in Appendix 3.  \n \n15.   Consultants and resource persons will be engaged by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Disbursements \nunder the TA  will  be made  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n16.   The  ADB  team  leader  will  monitor  the  work  under  the  TA  to  ensure  its  effective \nimplementation. Together with the lead economist, the ADB team leader will jointly supervise \nthe preparation of the research papers, and review and provide comments on the papers. Peer \nreview of papers within ADB and by external resource persons will also be used as a tool to \nevaluate the quality and depth of analysis of the research papers. The ADB team leader will set \nthe  production  schedule,  assure  proper  assignments,  and  be  responsible  for  meeting  the \ndeadlines for timely delivery of publications. \n \n17.   The two outputs of the TA will be implemented in parallel. The draft story lines of the \npolicy report and the book are in Appendix 4. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n18.   The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $850,000 on a grant basis for \nDevelopment through Empowerment: Delivering Effective Public Services, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board. \n                                                \n10 The TA will involve independent studies and require rapid mobilization of consultants to ensure that there are no \ndelays in the tight production schedule. In addition, the experience and qualifications of the individual consultants \nwill be the primary considerations. Thus, the consultants will be hired on an individual basis. \n ", "  Appendix 1   5 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \nImpact  By 2017:    Risk  \n \nThe study influences  At least three DMCs  Government  Political economy \nthe formulation and  incorporate the policy  development plans and  factors do not allow the \nimplementation of  recommendations into  policy announcements  implementation of \npolicies on public  their development plans  suggested reforms \nservice provision in  and policies on public   \nseveral DMCs.   service provision. \nOutcome  By project completion:    Assumption \n       \nPolicy lessons   \nThe results of the study  Reports and articles on \nderived from the  Issues of governance in \nare cited in two or more  public administration, \nstudy are referred to  public service delivery \npublications (2012  governance, and \nby policy makers,  will remain a topic of \nbaseline: none)  development by \ndevelopment  interest among \n  governments and \npractitioners, and  governments and \nThe content of the study is  development partners \nother stakeholders.  researchers \nused by ADB management   \n   \nin five or more speeches  DER media publication \nor public presentations  monitoring reports  \n(2012 baseline: none)   \n  ADB Management \nspeeches  \n \nADB documents \n   \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.

Policy Report \u2013 Story Line \n1.  Although developing Asia and the Pacific has been successful in achieving high rates of \ngrowth, it is still plagued by high rates of poverty and increasing inequality. Social concerns and \nissues have been rising simultaneously with the growth of gross domestic product.  \n \n2.  Governments in Asia and the Pacific spend substantial sums on the provision of public \nservices to improve indicators of social welfare, e.g., school enrolment, life expectancy, infant \nmortality, undernutrition, and water and power supply. More limited fiscal resources after the \nglobal crisis means that the economies of Asia and the Pacific will need to enhance efficiency of \npublic expenditure to improve development outcomes. Since the public sector in the region is \nimportant and the effectiveness of the delivery of its services is a vital development component, \nit is high time that the countries of Asia and the Pacific revisited the effectiveness of public \nservices from the point of view of both growth and equity. \n \n3.  This study will evaluate and compare the performance of public services in developing \nAsia and the Pacific with other regions. One approach that has been suggested to enhance the \neffectiveness of public services is to empower the poor, women, and other vulnerable classes. \nThis  project  will  discuss  philosophical  and  economic  underpinnings  of  the  subject  of \nempowerment and rationale for empowerment policies. It will consider a number of ways in \nwhich the concept of empowerment can be put into operation, highlighting the pros and cons, \ntrade-offs, and associated risks. \n \n(i)  A  \u201csocial  protection  floor\u201d  has  been  promoted  as  a  novel  approach  for \nempowering the people by providing universal access to a minimum level of \nessential  services  and  social  transfers.  This  research  project  will  examine \nalternative views on the social protection floor, including its fiscal costs and \nincentive effects on recipients. \n(ii)  Information  and  communication  technology  has  recently gained ground  as  a \npowerful route to empowering people. This study will analyze the success of \ninformation  and  communication  technology  in  e-governance,  addressing \nasymmetric information and lack of transparency in the use of public resources \nfor service delivery, and improving citizens\u2019 access to information.  \n(iii)  Government failure in some parts of the world has brought to the fore the gains \nfrom leveraging the private sector and nongovernment organizations in public \nservice provision. This project will try to answer a number of questions: How do \nwe take advantage of the private sector for development? How do we enhance \nthe  private  sector\u2019s  role  or  involvement  in  development?  What  sectors  can \nbenefit from public\u2013private partnerships? \n(iv)  It is often argued that better quality of intergovernmental decision making can \nempower  people  by  allowing  them  to  participate  in  the  process  of  service \ndelivery.  For  example,  decentralization  of  service  delivery  by  increasing  the \nrights, responsibilities, and powers of local governments through larger fiscal \ntransfers,  local  autonomy,  and  local  capacity  can  facilitate  participatory \napproaches to service delivery. Greater involvement of local governments in key \npublic service decisions can also reduce expenditure growth if central oversight \nis maintained. This study will analyze these and related issues. \n \n ", "12  Appendix 4 \n \nB.  Edited Book \u2013 Story Line \n4.  The  book  will  start  first  with  a  broad  discussion  of  governance\u2014its  importance, \nmeasurement, and the issues surrounding it. The book will then focus on the performance of \ndeveloping  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  where  governance  remains  a  bottleneck  to  growth  and \ndevelopment. There are various types of governance (e.g., economic, political, and democratic) \nthat  influence  economic growth.  However, given  the  paramount  importance  of government \npolicies  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  the  book  will  focus  on  the  current  status  of  economic \ngovernance that deals with government effectiveness. In particular, it will study the efficiency of \npublic spending for service provision, which is the most important source of government action \nto promote economic development.  \n \n5.  The rest of the book will follow along the lines of the policy report but include more \ndetailed empirical analyses to substantiate policy recommendations made in the report. \n \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"Author": "Asian Development Bank", "Company": "Licenced User", "CreationDate": "D:20121010175537+08'00'", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 9.0 for Word", "Keywords": "public services, transparency, social rights, social protection, education, water supply asia, food programs, adb projects, good governance, 46195, adb technical assistance, cdta/rdta/pata/ppta", "ModDate": "D:20121016152042+08'00'", "Producer": "Adobe PDF Library 9.0", "SourceModified": "D:20121010095507", "Subject": "Decision document for the Development through Empowerment: Delivering Effective Public Services presented to ADB\u2019s Board of Directors or Management for approval.", "Title": "TAR: Regional: Development through Empowerment: Delivering Effective Public Services"}, "author_page": " \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  DMC  \u2013  developing member country \n  SPF  \u2013  social protection floor \n  TA  \u2013  technical assistance \n \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLASSIFICATION \n \nType  \u2013  Research and development technical assistance (RDTA) \nTargeting  \u2013  General intervention \nclassification \nSectors (subsectors)  \u2013  Public  sector  management  (public  expenditure  and  fiscal \nmanagement,  decentralization);  transport  and  information  and \ncommunication  technology  (information  and  communication \ntechnology; health and social protection (social protection) \nThemes (subthemes)  \u2013  Governance  (economic  and  financial  governance;  public \nadministration  [national,  decentralized,  regional];  civil  society \nparticipation); economic growth (promoting economic efficiency \nand enabling business environment); social development (human \ndevelopment); gender equity (empowerment and rights) \nLocation (impact)  \u2013  Rural (high); urban (high); national (high) \n \nNOTE \n \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars.  \n \n \nVice-President  B.
