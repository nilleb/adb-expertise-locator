INTRODUCTION \n1.  During discussions for the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country operations business \nplan for 2015,1 the Government of Mongolia sought ADB technical assistance (TA) to prepare a \nstrategy for Northeast Asia power system interconnection (NAPSI) using Mongolia\u2019s abundant \nrenewable energy.2 The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy in its promotion of renewable \nenergy  development  and  regional  power  sector  integration.3 The  TA  is  also  aligned  with \nStrategy for Regional Cooperation in the Energy Sector of Central Asia Regional Economic \nCooperation Countries.4 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n   \n2.  The power sector is the single largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in Northeast \nAsia. A low-carbon transformation is needed to lessen reliance on fossil fuels and reduce the \ncarbon footprint. The region as a whole has sufficient renewable sources to meet demand, but \nthe limited connectivity of power systems among countries poses a major challenge. Each \njurisdiction has unique power utility ownership, tariff policies, market design and regulations, \nand other institutional frameworks that are not well coordinated or harmonized, which inhibits \ninterconnection. As a result, despite abundant energy sources many jurisdictions in Northeast \nAsia suffer from energy shortages or meet their energy needs at a high cost, resulting in high \nelectricity prices for consumers, and burdening economic activities.  \n \n3.  Power  systems  that  are  well  interconnected  would  improve  system  flexibility  and \nefficiency and allow system optimization, and thereby capture resource complementarities, bring \neconomies of scale into investments, improve fuel security, enable greater renewable energy \npenetration, and reduce power system carbon emissions. An interconnected system would also \nprovide more reliable and affordable electricity to consumers, enhance economic activities, and \nimprove the competitiveness of economies, thus underpinning regional sustainable growth; this \nhas  been  demonstrated  by  a  number  of  other  successful  interconnected  regional  power \nsystems (e.g., in the Greater Mekong Subregion). At present there is no such interconnected \npower market in Northeast Asia,5 even though it is home to some of the world's largest and \nmost prosperous economies. Mongolia is in a unique position to spur economic growth by \ndeveloping its vast energy resources to meet the power demands of its more prosperous \nneighbors through power exports. However, in the absence of an interconnected power system, \nMongolia lacks access to large neighboring markets, and thus to investment in its energy \nresources and power system development. There is a need to undertake a comprehensive \nanalysis and chart out a clear strategy for Mongolia for power system interconnections in \nNortheast Asia.6 \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2015. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2015. Manila.  \n2  The Northeast Asia power system includes the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Japan, the Republic of Korea, \nand Mongolia, and potentially includes Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation. The TA first appeared in the \nbusiness opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 18 August 2015.  \n3  ADB. 2009. Energy Policy. Manila. \n4  ADB. 2008. Strategy for Regional Cooperation in the Energy Sector of CAREC Countries. Manila.  \n5  The PRC exports a small amount of electricity to neighboring countries (e.g., the Republic of Korea and Mongolia). \nMongolia exports a small amount of excess electricity at night to the Russian Federation for the purpose of grid \nstability.  \n6  Existing regional energy sector cooperation initiatives are (i) the Greater Tumen Initiative, with participation by the \nPRC, the Republic of Korea, Mongolia, and the Russian Federation; and (ii) One Belt One Road, linking the PRC \nwith Mongolia and the Russian Federation. However, these initiatives have not conducted a comprehensive \nanalysis that includes all Northeast Asian countries and set out strategies for regional power interconnection.  \n ", "2   \n4.  Historically, power consumption and gross domestic product have grown in tandem. \nDevelopment of a cost-effective, sustainable power supply would enable continued growth in \nNortheast  Asia.  Advanced  and  emerging  economies  in  this  subregion\u2014e.g.,  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC), Japan, the Republic of Korea\u2014have high gross domestic product and \nelectricity consumption.7 Along with rapid economic growth, the PRC in particular has shown \ntremendous growth in power demand, which is projected to double by 2040.8 Japan and the \nRepublic of Korea rely on imported fossil fuels and will need low-carbon energy imports to meet \ntheir climate change targets.9  \n \n5.  On the other hand, Mongolia has tremendous renewable energy potential, especially \nwind  and  solar.  Some  10%  of  Mongolia\u2019s  land  area  (over  160,000  square  kilometers)  is \nestimated to have good to excellent wind potential for utility-scale applications (power density of \n400\u2013600  watts  per  square  meter).  According  to  conservative  estimates  by  the  National \nRenewable Energy Laboratory of Mongolia, at a capacity rate of 7 megawatts per square \nkilometer, this area of Mongolia has the potential to support more than 1,100 gigawatts of \ninstalled capacity. In addition, Mongolia averages 270\u2013300 sunny days per year. The South \nGobi region has average annual solar radiation of 1,400 kilowatt-hours per square meter, with a \nsolar intensity of 4.3\u20134.7 kilowatt-hours per square meter. The wind and solar power potential \nare estimated to be equivalent to 2,600 gigawatts of installed capacity, or 5,457 terawatt-hours \nof annual power generation (equivalent to 27% of global electricity consumption in 2014).10 If \none-third of this wind and solar potential was exploited, Mongolia could supply about 25% of \ncombined annual electricity demand of the PRC, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. Using \nabundant  and  diversified  resources,  Mongolia  could  serve  as  a  core  power  supplier  to \nneighboring countries, while improving power security and driving sustainable prosperity. Power \nsystem interconnection would be an ideal and comprehensive solution to reduce power system \ncarbon emissions in Northeast Asia.  \n \n6.  Three key drivers for an integrated power network in the subregion are the (i) demand\u2013\nsupply imbalance within Northeast Asian countries; (ii) availability of economical, sustainable \npower generation resources in a resource-rich country such as Mongolia, which justifies export; \nand  (iii)  close  proximity  of  Northeast  Asian  countries,  which  makes  cross-country  power \ninterconnection  and trade feasible.  Power  system  interconnection  by  low-loss,  high-voltage \ndirect  current  transmission  lines  would  allow  transmission  of  electricity  from  Mongolia  to \ndemand centers in neighboring countries. However, the existing transmission line infrastructure \nin  Mongolia  is  decrepit  and  requires  significant  investment  for  high-voltage  direct  current \ntransmission lines; Mongolia cannot afford this investment on its own,and will have to leverage \ninvestments from multilateral development banks emerging climate financing mechanism and \nprivate sector participation.   \n \n7.  There are serious institutional challenges to power market integration, including (i) the \nneed for closer alignment of national and regional investment decisions, which are currently \nindependent;  (ii)  differences  in  countries\u2019  regulatory  environments;  (iii)  inadequate  regional \ninstitutions; (iv) the need to maintain long-term commitments in frequently changing political \nframeworks; (v) national sovereignty and energy independence concerns; and (vi) the need to \n                                                \n7  Total electricity consumption in Northeast Asia in 2014 was around 6,675 terawatt-hours (TWh), including 5,200 \nTWh in the PRC, 950 TWh in Japan, 520 TWh in the Republic of Korea, and 5 TWh in Mongolia. A majority of the \nregion\u2019s electricity is generated using fossil fuel: 77% in the PRC, 87% in Japan, 66% in the Republic of Korea, and \n95% in Mongolia.  \n8  International Energy Agency. 2014. World Energy Outlook 2014. Paris.  \n9  Energy imports satisfy about 89% of Japan\u2019s energy demand, and 97% of demand in the Republic of Korea. \n10  National Renewable Energy Laboratory. 2009.

Given the sensitive geopolitical situation in Northeast Asia, a \nbottom-up  approach  that  engages  nongovernmental  institutions  and  the  private  sector  is \npreferable.  \n \n8.  The Government of Mongolia hosted the first regional conference on power system \ninterconnection  in  November  2012,  which  was  attended  by  nongovernment  organizations, \nresearch  institutes,  and  private  sectors  from  the  subregion.  Following  the  conference,  the \ngovernment, nongovernment organizations, and research institutes requested ADB support to (i) \nconduct analytical studies to prepare a road map for power system interconnection in Northeast \nAsia;  and  (ii)  raise  awareness,  build  consensus  and  increase  engagement  among \nnongovernment  organizations,  research  institutes,  and  the  private  sector  in  the  subregion \nregarding the importance of power interconnection with its extensive sector work throughout the \nsub-region. ADB is the most suitable institution to foster power system interconnection in the \nsubregion. The government established a task force in April 2014 under the Ministry of Energy \non the Asian Super Grid,12 which is an important element of Mongolia\u2019s development agenda. \nOther subregion stakeholders expressed strong interest in a future NAPSI, and ADB is exploring \npotential partnerships with some institutions.13 This TA can help enhance regional cooperation \nand  integration,  both  in  Northeast  Asia  and  through  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic \nCooperation regional framework by closely coordinating with its activities.14 \n \nIII.
