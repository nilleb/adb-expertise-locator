During the 2005 County Strategy and Program Mission, the Government of Uzbekistan \nconfirmed its request to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for technical assistance (TA) to \nprepare the Development of Market Infrastructure for Private Farms and Agribusinesses Project. \nA Fact-Finding Mission visited Uzbekistan during 17\u201325 August 2005 and held discussions with \nofficials and representatives from the Cabinet of Ministers, the Ministry of Agriculture and Water \nResources, the Ministry of Economy, the Ministry of Finance, the Association of Dekhan Farms, \nthe Businesswomen\u2019s Association, and the research institutes involved in fruit and vegetables \nand several farmers. The mission reached agreement with the Government on the objectives, \ndesign and monitoring framework, methodology, scope, implementation arrangements, cost, \nand financing. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s 2005 program. 1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Historically, agriculture has been the engine of growth in Uzbekistan\u2019s economy, and \ncurrently contributes more than 25% the country\u2019s gross domestic product, about a third of total \nnational employment, and half of total export earnings. Cotton is the primary export crop and \nforeign  exchange  revenue  earner,  and  wheat  production  assures  food  self-sufficiency. \nUzbekistan continues to be one of the major suppliers of fresh and processed fruit, vegetables, \nmeat, and wool to its neighbors while also providing bountiful quantities to the domestic market, \nalthough export sales of these products are currently sporadic and flat and go primarily to \nbuyers from Kazakhstan, Russian Federation, and Turkey. In the early 1990s, Uzbekistan was \nthe largest producer of fruit and vegetables in the former Soviet Union; however, its increased \ndependence  on  cotton  exports  and  revenue  led  to  a  loss  of  comparative  advantage  in \nhorticulture crops. There is scope for increasing the yields and productivity of horticulture crops \non private plots. Livestock and fodder are produced for the domestic market on a limited scale. \n3.  Following independence, the Government made significant changes in the agriculture \nsector. Reforms centered on dismantling the large state farms and introducing shirkat collective \nfarms (5,000 hectares or less) and private family farms (10\u2013250 hectares). Family farms already \ndominate Uzbek agriculture: in 2005, Uzbekistan had about 125,000 private family farms. The \nGovernment has been disappointed with the performance of the shirkat farms and is downsizing \nmost of them to the level of family farms. The downsizing is scheduled to be completed in 2007, \nleaving only about 820 nationwide. The Government has also expanded its program of dekhan \nor household farms, which are basically household gardens that are part of family farms and \nshirtkats. Dekhan farms are extremely small (0.17\u20130.37 hectares), but manage to contribute \nsignificantly to total agricultural output and account for some 90% of livestock output. Dekhan \nfarmers are free to grow what they want and sell their production at full market prices. Some of \nthe shirkats and private family farms that are adjacent to urban centers do not cultivate cotton \nand wheat, but instead produce higher-value fruit and vegetables and raise livestock largely for \nurban consumers. More than 6,000 family farms are specialized horticulture farms. Private \nfamily farms are marginally profitable, averaging SUM8,000 per hectare, because of their lower \nthan shirkats production costs and their relatively greater freedom to cultivate and sell other \ncrops on the remaining 10\u201320% of lands that are not dedicated to cotton and wheat. Dekhan \nplots effectively demonstrate the potential for high-value crop production. Estimates indicate that \nif given the opportunity, farmers\u2019 incomes from fruit and vegetables could be triple those derived \nfrom cotton and wheat.2 \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 13 October 2005. \n2  ADB. 2005.

Technical Assistance to the Republic of Uzbekistan for Institutional Support for \n ", "2   \n4.  Because of the strategic roles that cotton and wheat play in generating public revenues \nand in ensuring self-sufficiency in food, the Government is heavily involved in the upstream and \ndownstream value chains for these crops. At the farm level, farmers\u2019 production agreements \nwith processors\u2019 associations specify the cropping pattern, the volume of production, the areas \ndevoted to cotton and wheat production, and the prices received for these commodities. Input \nproduction, supplies of farm machinery, service provision, irrigation water and services, and \nprocessing and marketing for cotton and wheat are run predominantly by Government-owned \nenterprises. The Government also provides subsidized credit in support of quotas for these \ncrops. For cotton and wheat, the main impetus to growth in production will be a shift in the policy \nenvironment. Reforms have begun under three ongoing ADB-financed projects,3 with quota \nreductions and a dual pricing approach (procurement price for the quota production that is tied \nto world market prices and a higher procurement price for nonquota production). These reforms \nare being extended under the proposed Land Improvement Project, to be approved by ADB in \n2006, with quota reductions, improved pricing policies, restrictions on the influence of local \ngovernment  officials  in  production  and  marketing  decisions,  expanded  land  tenure  with \nregistered and transferable land titles, and improved credit access from commercial banks. The \nAgriculture  Sector  Project,  proposed  for  2008,  is  expected  to  further  deepen  reforms  and \nliberalize the production and marketing of cotton and wheat. \n5.  To a large extent, horticulture and livestock production functions within the framework of \na free market economy. The Government interferes little and provides limited research and \nextension services. Horticulture and livestock inputs are usually available at reasonable prices. \nThe production is sold either directly through local markets for fresh products or to small private \nenterprises specializing in fruit, vegetable, meat, wool, and leather processing. Processing \nfacilities  are  poor  and  limited,  and  there  is  large  scope  for  improvement  using  private \ninvestment. In this context, market infrastructure includes agricultural input and output supply \nsystems using wholesale, retail, and assembly markets; storage facilities; packaging and cold \nstorage facilities; transport, including refrigerated trucks; processing plants; and postharvest \nhandling facilities. These are largely considered to be private infrastructure goods. \n6.  Fruit  and  vegetable  products,  both  raw  and  processed,  have  the  potential  to  grow \nsignificantly  in  relation  to  both  domestic  and  export  markets  through  increased  private \ninvestment  and  technology  transfer,  thereby  accelerating  development  in  horticulture  and \nagribusiness. Demand for better quality and larger quantities of fresh and processed fruit and \nvegetables is expected to increase because of the gradual change in the population\u2019s tastes \nand preferences and because of expanded incomes and employment opportunities. The time is \nright  for  expanded  support  to  horticulture  producers  and  small-scale,  private  agribusiness \nentrepreneurs.  Fruit  and  vegetable  farmers  and  processors  require  an  integrated  market \napproach that will assure market access; technology training; good quality planting materials; \nfarm management improvements; improved cultivation practices; appropriate machinery; and \nfarmer-based  and  commercial  organizations  with  links  to  the  private  sector,  including \nconsumers and supermarkets in Uzbekistan and in other countries. Agribusiness processors \nand wholesalers will benefit from capacity building through hands-on training and access to \n                                                 \nSustainable Agricultural Development.

Even though Uzbekistan has a large number of entrepreneurs at all \nlevels, they clearly need assistance with business planning and administration and product \ndevelopment.  Enterprise  managers,  family-owned  businesses,  and  staff  require  better \nunderstanding of the functions of an enterprise and how to develop realistic business plans. \nThere is also a need for the TA to explore (i) financial mechanisms that enable agribusinesses \nto  access  credit;4  (ii)  measures  for  providing  agricultural  support  services  and  market \ninformation  and  communication  technologies  to  private  producers,  entrepreneurs,  and \nmarketing agents; and (iii) institutional linkages, such as involvement in agribusiness support by \nthe  Association  of  Dekhan  Farms,  businesswomen\u2019s  associations,  and  the  Chamber  of \nCommerce.   \n7.  ADB\u2019s strategy in the sector is to promote sustainable, employment-generating growth \nand to accelerate rural development by providing support for a diversified, productive, and \nsustainable rural sector to create rural jobs and raise rural incomes. The Government and ADB \nagree that looking beyond agriculture at key aspects of rural development (rural services, \ninfrastructure,  and  environmental  management)  in  a  holistic  way  is  important.  The  donor \ncommunity is beginning to provide access to market infrastructure for private farmers and \nagribusinesses on a limited scale,. The World Bank\u2019s Rural Enterprise Support Project has a \nrural finance component that onlends working capital and investment funds to private farms and \nrural business enterprises. The International Finance Corporation is providing technical support \nand a special credit facility for the creation and development of leasing as a medium-term \nfinancial instrument for the procurement of machinery, equipment, vehicles, and so on. The \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development has started to provide working capital to \ntwo agro-enterprises that produce and export dried and concentrated fruit and vegetables. The \nUnited Nations Center for Trade and Development and the World Trade Organization are \nproviding assistance to facilitate trade in agricultural products and equipment by publishing \ndemand forecasts and import requirements. These external financing agencies estimate that \ndemand for horticulture products in local and foreign markets is large. \n8.  The lessons learned from these experiences are (i) that demand from private farms and \nprivate agribusinesses for market infrastructure facilities is large; (ii) that the agriculture sector \ncan take advantage of diverse local and foreign markets; (iii) that incentives are required for \nprivate investment, which is needed to ensure that private farmers and entrepreneurs are on a \npar with their trading rivals in other countries; and (iv) that access to and development of \nprivately-run financial mechanisms and contractual arrangements that foster vertical alliances \namong strategic players in the value chain are equally important. The TA will build on the \nlessons learned by the Government and the donor community from previous and ongoing \nagriculture-based project investments in Uzbekistan and other countries. The TA will include a \nvalue chain analysis to identify existing financial services for small-scale private agribusinesses \nthat can provide business plans that can clearly justify a viable return on investment.  \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1996.

The  Project\u2019s  impact  will  be  to  ensure  the  profitability  of  private  farms  and \nagribusinesses by providing market infrastructure for horticulture. The project preparatory TA\u2019s \noutcome will be a feasibility study of the agreed methodology, activities, and implementation \nand financing arrangements for an investment project. Appendix 1 provides the design and \nmonitoring framework.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The scope of the TA is to carry out a feasibility study that will determine the investments \nin market infrastructure that will directly benefit private farms and agribusinesses by increasing \nproductivity and improving incomes and profitability by diversifying to high-valued crops, making \nintensive use of input resources, and adding value to farm produce through further processing \nand/or expansion of market outlets. The TA will be conducted in two phases: phase 1, a \ndiagnostic  phase  comprising  an  analysis  of  the  current  situation,  including  a  value  chain \nanalysis of key horticulture products, and phase 2, a prescriptive phase that proposes options \nand recommendations for an investment project. The TA will have three major outputs. The first \nis a comprehensive assessment of (i) the marketing arrangements for major cash crops (fruit \nand vegetables) to determine key market infrastructure needs; (ii) the training and capacity gaps \namong  those  working  at  private  farms  and  agribusinesses,  as  well  as  an  analysis  of  the \nstrengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats pertaining to institutions and of contractual \nand other arrangements that, if provided, would complement market infrastructure investments \nby enhancing the integration of private farms with the value chain; and (iii) the socioeconomic \nand environmental conditions of farms producing and marketing cash crops. This output will \ndetermine the options for market infrastructure investment that could potentially be financed by \nthe Project. The second output of the TA will be a technical, economic, financial, and socio-\nenvironmental appraisal of investment options that also identifies the project components. This \nappraisal will include an analysis of the value chain to identify bottlenecks, stakeholder analysis \nto ascertain the distribution of costs and benefits, and a budget analysis of sample enterprises \nto show how interventions can reduce costs and improve financial and economic performance. \nThe third output is detailed cost estimates, a financing plan, and implementation arrangements. \n11.  Key activities include (i) establishing a database and developing the market demand and \nsupply  analysis  for  the  cash  crops;  (ii)  determining  the  priority  market  infrastructure \nrequirements for the value chain of cash crops; (iii) identifying the capacity-building needs of \nprivate farms and agribusinesses in relation to the market infrastructure options as well as the \ncontractual and/or institutional arrangements that will better align them with the value chain; (iv) \ndetermining the financial mechanisms and arrangements for accessing the market infrastructure \ndeveloped through the Project; (v) preparing the technical, financial, economic, and socio-\nenvironmental analyses using with and without project scenarios; (vi) validating the project \ndesign  through  periodic  consultation  meetings  with  representative  stakeholders;  and \n(vii) detailing  the  costs  and  financing  mechanisms  of  the  Project,  identifying  the  risks  and \nassumptions, and determining the appropriate management and monitoring systems that will \nensure efficient and effective implementation of the Project. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the ADB TA grant is estimated to be $850,000 equivalent, to be \nfinanced by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. It is proposed that ADB finance $600,000 equivalent. \n ", "  5\nThe Government will provide $250,000 equivalent in in-kind counterpart costs and services.5 \nThe Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance \nany ensuing project. The detailed cost estimates are given in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The  Executing  Agency  will  be  the  Rural  Restructuring  Agency  of  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture and Water Resources. Overall supervision and coordination within the Government \nwill be the responsibility of the Information and Analytical Department on Agriculture Industry \nand Water Economy of the Cabinet of Ministers. The TA will be carried out over 5 months, \ncommencing in January 2006 and ending in June 2006. A total of 46.5 person-months of \nindividual consulting services will be required: 18.5 international and 28.0 domestic. Some of the \ntime  has  not  been  allocated  to  specific  specialists  to  accommodate  needs  for  additional \nexpertise identified during the study or extensions of some members of the consulting team, if \nrequired. The international consultants will have expertise in agribusiness marketing, agricultural \neconomics, financial analysis, and environmental assessment. The domestic consultants will \nhave expertise in institutional and social assessment, horticulture crops, agroprocessing, farm \nmachinery, and legal issues. The outline terms of reference for consulting services are in \nAppendix 3. ADB will engage individual consultants in accordance with the Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The consultants will procure equipment \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n14.  At the end of the first month following commencement of the TA, the consultant team will \nsubmit an inception report to the Rural Restructuring Agency and ADB that will be discussed in \na tripartite review meeting and at a stakeholder workshop. In the third month, the team will \nsubmit a draft midterm report to the Rural Restructuring Agency and ADB that will include \npreliminary findings of the assessment of various project components. The midterm report will \nincorporate suggestions raised during the first stakeholder workshop and will culminate in a \nsecond tripartite review meeting in the third month. At the end of the fourth month, a draft final \nreport will be submitted to the Rural Restructuring Agency and ADB and will be presented by \nthe consultants at a second stakeholder workshop. A third tripartite review meeting will also be \nheld to discuss the draft final report. The suggestions from the stakeholder workshops and the \nthird  tripartite  review  meeting  will  be  incorporated  into  the  final  report.  All  reports  will  be \nsubmitted in both English and Russian. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Uzbekistan  for  preparing  the  Development  of  Market  Infrastructure  for \nPrivate Farms and Agribusinesses Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n5  The Government will (i) provide an office with furniture and fixtures for use by the team of consultants; (ii) pay for \nutilities (heating and electricity) for the office; (iii) ensure access to telephone service; (iv) pay for the remuneration, \nper diem, and transportation expenses of the Government\u2019s counterpart staff assigned to the TA; and (v) provide \nthe team with access to the Government\u2019s data, maps, survey results, and other documents. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks \nImpact       Assumptions \n      \u2022  Project design is \nIncreased profitability of  Access to horticulture  Monitoring reports of the  implemented effectively  \nprivate farms and  market infrastructure  Ministry of Agriculture and  \u2022  The Government and the \nagribusinesses  improved  Water Resources and the  Asian Development Bank \nCabinet of Ministers  (ADB) sign a loan \nagreement \n \nOutcome      Assumption \n      The Government continues to \nInvestment project design  Successful project design  Memorandum of  promote private sector \nagreed to by the  and appraisal mission in  understanding  participation in the agriculture \nGovernment and ADB  2006  sector \nOutputs      Assumptions \n      \u2022  Effective stakeholder \n1.
