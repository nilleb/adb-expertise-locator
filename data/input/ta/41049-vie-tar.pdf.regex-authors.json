From  2003  to  2007,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  implemented  a  policy  \nresearch-oriented regional technical assistance (RETA) entitled Making Markets Work Better for \nthe Poor (M4P1), which covered Viet Nam, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, and Cambodia. \nThis $2.4 million RETA was cofinanced by ADB, the Department for International Development \n(DFID)  of  the  United  Kingdom,  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  Institute.  During \nimplementation,  additional  cofinancing  was  obtained  from  AusAID  and  the  ADB  Poverty \nReduction Fund, bringing the RETA\u2019s total to $2.9 million. The RETA also entered into joint \nfunding arrangements with the Mekong Private Sector Development Facility, and Centre de \nCoop\u00e9ration Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le D\u00e9veloppement (CIRAD). M4P1 \nwas successful in raising awareness of the potentially positive role of market development in \nachieving poverty reduction as well as economic growth1 and was completed at the end of 2007. \nThe  knowledge  generated  was  disseminated  widely  to  the  public  and  discussed  with \ngovernment  agencies and  other  stakeholders.  At  the  December  2006  Advisory  Committee \nMeeting for the RETA, DFID expressed an interest in cofinancing Making Markets Work Better \nfor the Poor Phase 2 (M4P2).  \n \n2.  A TA reconnaissance mission, with participation from DFID, was fielded in Hanoi, Viet \nNam, 23\u201325 January 2007 to assess the case for this follow-on phase. A memorandum of \nunderstanding signed on 11 July 2007 records the mutual understanding and agreements \nbetween the mission and the Government, and incorporates the main elements of the design \nand monitoring framework as shown in Appendix 1.2\n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The country strategy and program for Viet Nam3 supports the implementation of the Viet \nNam Socioeconomic Development Plan (SEDP) and its target of reducing poverty incidence to \n10%\u201311% by the end of 2010. To achieve this goal, the poor must move to more productive \noccupations. Greater market participation by the poor is key to ensuring that the benefits of \nrapid growth remain equitably spread among all the population. The private sector is the main \nforce behind this process as enterprises respond to opportunities presented by international and \ndomestic  economic  integration,  which  generate  jobs  and  wealth.  Business-led  pro-poor \neconomic growth is a focus of the Country Strategy and Program, and M4P2 will contribute \ndirectly to this objective through the generation of practical, replicable examples of market \ndevelopment combining the private sector\u2019s resources and dynamism with the poor\u2019s increasing \nparticipation. To help improve the impact and effectiveness of the ADB portfolio, some of these \nMaking  Markets  Work  Better  for  the  Poor  (M4P)  examples  will  leverage  the  resources  of \nongoing or planned ADB projects. By involving the private sector in the delivery of development \nobjectives, M4P2 will complement other official development assistance activities based on the \nfinancing of government programs.  \n \n4.  The  goal  of  M4P1  was  to  enhance  the  knowledge  and  understanding  of  the  links \nbetween growth and poverty and the dynamics of markets and institutions with a view to \nfacilitating sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction. The outputs and purposes of \nM4P1 were to: (i) undertake policy related studies on pro-poor market related issues, and build \n                                                 \n1  M4P1, in collaboration with a growing network of over 30 Vietnamese research entities, successfully produced 18 \nsubstantive research reports, 19 discussion papers, 17 briefings, and 12 bulletins on the participation of the poor in \na range of factor, commodity, and service markets. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 10 October 2007. \n3   ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program: Viet Nam 2007\u20132010. Manila. \n ", "2   \ncapacity  amongst  local  researchers;  (ii)  build  networks  between  the  project,  researchers, \npolicymakers, international organizations and other stakeholders; and (iii) utilize the research \nresults and developed networks in order to have a positive impact on policies and planning \nrelated to pro-poor market development.  \n \n5.  M4P1 funded more than 20 major research activities by a total of 31 local organizations \nwhich involved analytical studies on priority issues linked to market development and their \ninteractions for poverty reduction in the main thematic areas of (i) factor markets that are \nimportant to the poor; (ii) the participation of the poor in global value chains; and (iii) markets \nand service delivery. The research results and developed networks have been utilized by M4P1 \nin the development of markets to promote sustainable pro-poor economic growth. Examples of \nimpacts of research under M4P1 include (i) the development of a sustainable smallholder \nbamboo production sector supplying IKEA4 with materials for flooring, delivering additional \nbenefits of over $1 million per year to poor households in two rural districts of Thanh Hoa \nprovince;  (ii)  the  development  of  two  IFAD  supported  market-based  investment  projects \namounting to more than $60 million for improving livelihoods of around 200,000 rural poor in \nfour provinces; (iii) the development of a legal framework and improved management system for \nsmall-scale  street  vendors  benefiting  thousands  of  poor  women  in  Hanoi  and  surrounding \nprovinces; and (iv) contributing to the development of revisions to the Law on Cooperatives, \nallowing for alternative forms of collective action suitable for the poor and improved operation of \nmore than 5,000 agricultural cooperatives with more than 200,000 members nationwide.  \n \n6.  DFID  and  ADB  have  supported  an  extensive  stakeholder  consultation  process  to \nvalidate  these  perceptions  of  M4P\u2019s  relevance  to  Viet  Nam\u2019s  development  priorities.  The \nconsultations  focused  on  partnerships  established  during  M4P15  and  strongly  supported \nM4P2\u2019s further development and implementation, highlighting that M4P2 should have a more \npractical, action-oriented approach in order to build directly on the strong theoretical background \nand networks developed under M4P1. The stakeholders recommended a sharper focus in \nM4P2 than the more broadly based M4P1 which resulted in selection of three key focus areas, \nbased on the knowledge accumulated in these areas under M4P1 and stakeholder interest. \nBesides the \"policy action\" research to be undertaken to adapt the knowledge gained from \nM4P1, a significant portion of M4P2 expenditure will be on a competitive Market Participation \nChallenge Fund which will serve to finance implementing practical applications of pro-poor \nmarket initiatives in the three focus areas. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n7.  M4P2  will  build  on  M4P1\u2019s  successful  experiences  but  will  also  reflect  its  lessons \nlearned. M4P2 will be a country-specific TA.  Management and implementation responsibilities \nwill be passed to Vietnamese institutions with strategic oversight provided by a multi-agency \nmanagement board. TA activities will be more action-oriented and restricted to three focus \nareas: (i) infrastructure services, (ii) value chain development, and (iii) labor markets. The \n                                                 \n4  IKEA is a privately-held, international home products retailer that sells low-price merchandise, including furniture, \naccessories, bathrooms, and kitchens, at retail stores around the world. \n5  These  stakeholders  include:  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Research  Commission;  Central  Institute  for  Economic \nManagement (CIEM); Viet Nam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI); Ministry of Planning and Investment \n(MPI); Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development; Ministry of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA); and \nMinistry of Finance (MOF), in addition to the 10 Vietnamese research institutes who participated in M4P1. Among \ndonors,  consultations  included  the  World  Bank,  German  Development  Cooperation,  International  Fund  for \nAgricultural Development, United Nations Development Programme, Mekong Private Sector Development Facility, \nand  AusAID.  Nongovernmental  organization  consultations  included  Oxfam,  Compliance  Review  Panel, \nInternational Development Enterprises, SNV, and local business associations. \n ", "  3\nproposed TA will incorporate an innovative matching grant scheme, a challenge fund, which is \nspecifically aimed at engaging the private sector. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the proposed TA is increased participation of the poor in markets for \ninfrastructure  services,  value  chains,  and  private  sector  employment.  The  outcome  of  the \nproposed  TA  is  to  achieve  wider  application  of  M4P  approach  through  replication, \ninstitutionalization, and capacity building. The proposed TA will work with selected government \nagencies concerned and the Viet Nam Market Participation Challenge Fund (VMPCF) grantees \nin the areas of infrastructure services, value chains, and job creation. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The proposed TA comprises two components: (i) a policy action research and plan, and \n(ii) the VMPCF. The policy action research and plan facilitates the adoption of market-oriented \nand  pro-poor  action  plans  by  selected  government  agencies,  ADB,  and  other  donors  that \nfinanced investment projects and programs. These plans can then be instantly adopted by \npolicymakers  and  project  implementers.  To  ensure  strong  demand  and  a  clear  practical \napplication for the research outputs, each research proposal will be sponsored by a government \nor private sector client who also has a clearly stated need or demand for the research work. The \nVMPCF component will provide complementary investment support on a competitive matching \ngrant basis for private enterprises that propose innovative new business models to engage the \npoor on a replicable and sustainable basis. The VMPCF will initially focus on agro-processing \nlinkages with the poor but will expand to other areas such as infrastructure services if the initial \nimplementation experience is positive.6\n \n10.  The key activities for implementing these components are related to (i) project and \nknowledge  management,  including  facilitating  procurement  and  project  implementation, \nmonitoring and reporting, knowledge management, communication, and advocacy of findings \nfrom action plans and challenge fund projects; and (ii) capacity development, including direct \nassistance to project stakeholders, including researchers, project staff, government agencies, \nprivate sector firms, and the poor. The TA will facilitate the exchange and application of lessons \nacross  the  various  market  development  interventions  within  Viet  Nam  and  abroad.  It  will \ncontinue to develop the successful M4P1 communication tools, including the project web site, \nbi-monthly bulletin, and discussion papers and briefings. Adequate provision will be made to \nensure  that  executing  agency  (EA)  and  implementing  agency  (IA)  staff  and  other  project \nstakeholders can participate in global M4P learning events sponsored by ADB/DFID. Activities \nrelated to capacity development will include training, workshops, and seminars, and will target \nspecific bottlenecks that are impeding implementation. Continuing capacity development will \nalso occur in the various methodologies and approaches associated with M4P, including further \ndissemination and development of the Participatory Market Assessment Handbook and Value \n                                                 \n6  Challenge funds are a way to allocate grants competitively to corporate entities to implement development-oriented \nprojects that meet the challenge fund eligibility criteria. Funds are used to encourage commercially-focused \nstakeholders to make extra efforts to reach the poor or devise market-based solutions that would significantly \nbenefit the poor. Challenge funds have been used successfully in the United Kingdom to engage the private sector \nin socially desirable projects such as urban regeneration. More recently, DFID has tested several challenge funds, \ne.g., the Financial Deepening Challenge Fund, Business Linkages Challenge Fund, Ghana Business Linkages \nChallenge Fund, and Africa Enterprise Challenge Fund. \n7  In addition to the research studies completed under M4P1, ADB has maintained a dialogue over the past year with \nthe Exchange for Social Investment and the World Resources Institute, which are nonprofit organizations working \non this issue.  \n ", "4   \nChain Development Toolbook, strategies for engagement with the \u201cBase of the Pyramid,\u201d7 \nmeasures of market competitiveness, and the use of public-private partnerships in infrastructure \nprovision and other services to the poor. \n \n11.  To maintain momentum and continuity, M4P2 will continue with selected M4P1 thematic \nwork. To achieve a more direct impact on the livelihoods of the poor, M4P2 will also engage \ndirectly with ongoing government- and donor-financed investment projects. General criteria for \nselecting a project intervention include the potential for pro-poor impact, potential contribution to \ngovernment priorities through market development and poverty reduction, likely sustainability, \npotential  for  leverage  of  ongoing  or  future  investment  projects,  ease  of  management  and \nimplementation, practicality of intervention, degree of direct participation by the poor, design and \nimplementation, degree of innovation, and ability to record and replicate the interventions.  \n  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The total cost of the proposed TA is estimated at $10.1 million equivalent, of which (i) \n$400,000 will be financed by ADB\u2019s TA funding program, (ii) $8 million equivalent, of which $3 \nmillion equivalent is for the VPMCF grants, will be cofinanced on a grant basis in pounds \nsterling  by  the  DFID  and  administered  by  ADB,  and  (iii)  $1.7  million  equivalent  will  be \ncontributed in-kind by the Government. The cofinancing arrangement between ADB and DFID is \njoint cofinancing. Detailed cost estimates are shown in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Reviewing, Monitoring, and Evaluation  \n13.  Sufficient resources from ADB are allocated for project monitoring and implementing. A \nTA  administration  memorandum,  similar  to  a  project  administration  memorandum,  will  be \nformulated and submitted to all stakeholders including ADB, DFID, EA, and IAs. A joint midterm \nreview of the M4P2 by all financing parties will be carried out 30 months after the TA\u2019s inception \nto assess the extent to which the targeted outputs and outcomes are achieved. The main \ncriteria for success will be evidence of actual changes in business practices and the increased \ninvolvement of the poor, resulting from the activities carried out in the TA. DFID has indicated \nthat following a successful implementation of M4P2, another phase of the project may follow. \nThe conditions and criteria for proceeding to Phase 3 will be jointly determined by ADB, DFID, \nand the technical M4P2 team during the project inception. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB will administer the overall TA in close consultation with the EA\u2014MPI\u2014and two IAs \nfor the two project components. The Central Institute for Economic Management (CIEM) will be \nthe IA for the policy action research and plan component. TA implementation will be guided by a \nmanagement board chaired by a vice minister from the Ministry of Planning and Investment \n(MPI) and comprising the following members: ADB, DFID, Farmers\u2019 Association, Ministry of \nAgriculture and Rural Development, MOF, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, \nState Bank of Viet Nam, trade unions, and Viet Nam Chamber of Commerce and Industry \n(VCCI).  The  board  will  meet  quarterly  during  the  first  year  and  then  twice  yearly  once \nimplementation is proceeding smoothly. The board will have three broad functions: (i) approval \nof the M4P2 strategy; (ii) fiduciary oversight, including review of annual audit reports and the \nVMPCF\u2019s  six  monthly  financial  statements;  and  (iii)  appointing  and  holding  executive \nmanagement accountable, especially in terms of the overall progress and impact of the project. \nIn performing these functions, the board will be supported by three consulting groups working at \nthe Project Coordination Unit (PCU), Policy Action Research Unit (PARU), and the VMPCF. \n ", "  5\nAppendix  3  presents  the  division  of  labor  among  the  IAs  and  detailed  implementation \narrangements. As part of project inception, detailed implementation manuals will be developed.  \n \n15.  The proposed TA will be implemented over a period of 3 years, from February 2008 to \nJanuary 2011. It will engage a total of 73 person-months for international specialists and 246 \nperson-months for national specialists. The consultants will report to a designated TA officer \nand work under the overall supervision of the management board. A total of 12 consultants, \nlocated  at  the  PCU,  PARU,  and  VMPCF  (providing  192  person-months  of inputs),  will  be \nengaged  on  a  consulting  firm  basis.  In  addition  to  the  firm-based  consultant  team,  9 \nindependent  consultants/resources  persons  (providing  67  person-months  of  inputs)  will  be \nengaged on an individual basis for the purpose of (i) continuing operational work carried out \nunder  the  M4P1  PCU,  including  communication,  advocacy,  and  knowledge  management \nactivities;  (ii)  supporting  the  TA  officer  in  formulating  TA  administration  memorandum;  (iii) \ndeepening M4P2 links to ADB\u2019s Viet Nam portfolio for direct use by ADB by applying M4P \napproaches to ADB pipeline project development; and (iv) conducting an independent midterm \nreview of the project\u2019s implementation with ADB and DFID staff. A majority of consultants will be \nrecruited on a firm basis to ensure the best synergy of all project components and activities. The \nreasons for allowing some individual selection are to: (i) ensure a continuation and smooth \nhandover between the interim team and the permanent team, (ii) ensure sufficient resources be \nallocated for monitoring and implementing the TA, (iii) allow more flexibility in timely recruiting of \nappropriate consultants as the ADB programming and project implementation schedule are \nregularly adjusted, and (iv) provide objective inputs to the midterm review. The outline terms of \nreference for both the firm-based and individual-based consultants are contained in Appendix 4, \nand detailed terms of reference are included in Supplementary Appendix 1. The consultants will \nbe  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). The interested consulting firms are required to submit full technical \nproposals. The selection method of the firm will be quality- and cost-based selection criteria with \na 80:20 quality-cost ratio. The project coordinator, under close consultation with ADB and DFID, \nwill  be  responsible  for  organizing  the  workshops.  Supplementary  Appendix  2  presents  an \noverview of the first year workplan and indicative division of labor among project IAs. \n \n16.  Equipment will be procured for use at the PCU and PARU, and for the fund management \nteam who manages the VMPCF, using ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from \ntime  to  time).  After  TA  completion,  the  equipment  will  be  disposed  of  as  follows:  (i)  the \nequipment used by the PCU to MPI, (ii) the equipment used by the PARU to CIEM, and (iii) the \nequipment used for the VMPCF implementation to MOF. An advance payment facility (APF) will \nbe established for the TA\u2019s implementation to allow advanced payments on regular and planned \nactivities including VMPCF payments to the grantees and expenses for workshops, seminars, \nand conferences. Expenditures under APF will be liquidated using statements of expenditure \nprocedure and satisfactory external audit reports. Supplementary Appendix 3 presents the APF \nagreement to be incorporated in the TA agreement. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION AND DECISION  \n17.   The President recommends that the Board approve ADB administering a portion of \ntechnical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $8,000,000 to the Government of Viet Nam \nfor Making Markets Work Better for the Poor Phase 2, to be financed on a grant basis by the \nGovernment of the United Kingdom. If the Board approves ADB administering the technical \nassistance, the President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, will approve ADB \nproviding the balance of the technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000, for \nMaking Markets Work Better for the Poor Phase 2. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nIncreased participation of  Greater outreach of  Gender-disaggregated  \u2022  The private sector remains \nthe poor in markets for 3  services to the poor in  baseline studies for selected  the main driving force behind \nselected thematic areas  infrastructure service  projects using the following  the country development \n(infrastructure services,  investment projects by  data:   process, generating jobs and \nvalue chains, and private  January 2011    wealth. \nsector employment)     \u2022  Independent VHLSS by  \u2022  The selected 3 thematic \nGreater participation of the  GSO (VHLSS 2006, 2008)   areas are of great interest to \npoor in value chain  \u2022  Population and Housing  the private sector to improve \ndevelopment by January  Census 2009 by GSO   incomes and choices for the \n2011  \u2022  Annual enterprise census  poor. \n  produced by GSO   \nIncreased participation of  \u2022  Labor force survey  Risks \nthe poor in formal private  produced by GSO and   \nsector employment by  MOLISA   \u2022  Exogenous economic \nJanuary 2011  \u2022  Employment data and  shocks \n  other labor market surveys   \n \nProject progress reports \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nWider application of M4P  Application of M4P tools  Project progress reports  \u2022  Action plan implementation \napproach through  and approaches by project    influences investment project \nreplication,  stakeholders  Participants\u2019 feedback  design and \ninstitutionalization, and    surveys  implementation/policy \ncapacity building.

The implementing agencies, the Central Institute for Economic Management (CIEM) and \nthe Ministry of Finance (MOF), will implement tasks in line with their institutional comparative \nadvantages.  Other  agencies  will  be  engaged to  implement  specific research  or  to  receive \ncapacity-strengthening  assistance.  For  example,  the  Ministry  of  Construction,  Ministry  of \nAgriculture and Rural Development, Ministry of Health, and provincial people\u2019s committees are \nlikely to be involved in public-private partnership development in small-town and rural water and \nsanitation; Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and Institute of Policy and Strategy for \nAgriculture and Rural Development are likely to be involved in value chain development; and the \nMinistry of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs and Institute of Labor Science and Social Affairs \nare likely to be involved in labor market development. The Viet Nam Chamber of Commerce \nand Industry (VCCI) will play a key role in mobilizing private sector participation in both the \nchallenge fund and in the implementation of action research pilots such as infrastructure public-\nprivate partnerships, value chains, and skill development. As in Making Markets Work Better for \nthe Poor Phase 1 (M4P1), Making Markets Work Better for the Poor Phase 2 (M4P2) will \ncollaborate with other donor programs operating in these areas. \n \n2.  CIEM will lead the management and commission of action research, ensuring relevance \nto Viet Nam\u2019s development priorities, consistency with pro-poor market development and the \nproject\u2019s themes, and a strong demand from an implementing or operational agency. CIEM will \nensure that the research has a strong action orientation and leads to the final product of an \naction plan. It will carefully monitor the delivery of outcomes and ensure that the main messages \nand lessons from the action research and implementation of the action plan are included in the \nM4P2 communication and advocacy strategy. It will assume the lead knowledge management \nrole by facilitating the use and uptake of project learning by policymakers and implementers.  \n \n3.  MOF  will  oversee  the  management  and  implementation  of  the  Viet  Nam  Market \nParticipation Challenge Fund (VMPCF). The VMPCF\u2019s direct daily operations will be contracted \nto an independent consulting firm as part of the overall firm-based consultant team. MOF will \ncollaborate with VCCI to leverage the VCCI network of private sector enterprises and to ensure \nthat the opportunities available under the VMPCF are well known by enterprises. VCCI will help \nidentify potential private sector applicants and ensure that they have a strong understanding of \nthe requirements and eligibility criteria. MOF will ensure that the development impact and \nreplication  of  challenge  fund  models  are  effectively  monitored,  making  sure  that  the  main \nlessons learned are included in M4P2 knowledge management, communication, and advocacy \nactivities. VCCI will facilitate private sector participation within the main project themes. For \nexample, the success of public-private partnership arrangements for infrastructure delivery will \ndepend on good private enterprise participation for effective service delivery. Similarly, private \nenterprises are the main drivers of value chain upgrading and are the main employers in labor \nmarkets. Monitoring and learning lessons from the operational experience of firms will provide \nuseful information for policymakers. \n \nA.  Detailed Implementation Arrangements \n \n4.  The  following  paragraphs  further  elaborate  the  implementation  arrangements  to  be \ncarried out in the three project units.  \n \n5.  Project Coordination Unit.

The PCU will undertake \nthe following tasks: (i) serve as the secretariat to the management board by organizing and \nfacilitating the board meetings; (ii) monitor, report, and review project implementation; (iii) scale \nup M4P2 impact through knowledge management activities with other international development \nagencies; (iv) organize training, seminars, and workshops for knowledge dissemination and \ncapacity-building purposes; and (v) carry out communication and advocacy activities. In addition \nto the firm-based consultant team, the PCU will host short-term, independent consultants who \nwill be recruited on an individual basis to ensure complementary inputs to the implementation of \nongoing government and ADB projects as well as to the formulation of ADB projects in the \n2007\u20132010  pipeline,  and  subjective  inputs  to  ADB  and  Department  for  International \nDevelopment (DFID) staff for the midterm review of project implementation for considering the \ncontinuation of Phase 3. \n \n6.  Policy  Action  Research  Unit.  CIEM  will  host  and  implement  the  Policy  Action \nResearch  Unit,  ensuring  the  relevance  of  M4P2  research  activities  to  the  needs  and \nrequirements of government policymakers. The selection of the policy action research and plan \nproposals will follow the general criteria for selecting a project intervention as stated (see para. \n10 of the main text). These proposals will be endorsed by the management board as part of \nM4P2. CIEM will lead the management and commission of action research using a competitive \nselection process, ensuring relevance to Viet Nam\u2019s development priorities, consistency with \npro-poor  market  development  and  the  project\u2019s  themes,  and  strong  demand  from  an \nimplementing or operational agency. CIEM will ensure that the research has a strong action \norientation and leads to the final product of an action plan. It will carefully monitor the delivery of \noutcomes and ensure that the main messages and lessons from the action research and \nimplementation of the action plans are included in the M4P2 communication and advocacy \nstrategy. CIEM will assume the lead knowledge management role by facilitating the use and \nuptake of project learning by policymakers and implementers.  \n \n7.  Viet Nam Market Participation Challenge Fund.

The \nteam will receive guidance and direction from the management board while coordinating with an \nindependent  assessment  panel.  In  view  of  the  VMPCF\u2019s  private  sector  focus,  MOF  will \ncooperate with VCCI in order to make use of the VCCI countrywide private sector network to \nmobilize the participation of private sector players in the competitive selection process.  \n \n8.  Nature of the VMPCF, Eligibility Criteria, and Disbursement.1 The VMPCF\u2019s overall \ngoal  is  to  leverage  private  sector  involvement  in  the  delivery  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  development \nobjectives, including employment and better services to the poor. Grants will be given for \ninnovative and eligible projects, and funding decisions will be made on a competitive, deadline-\ndriven basis by an independent panel. The most desirable bids will receive funding on a grant \nbasis. Bidders are expected to contribute, at a minimum, 51% of total project costs in cash and \nin-kind, as defined in VMPCF guidance on bidder contributions. Eligible projects will qualify for \nfunding if they can demonstrate that the project (i) contributes directly or indirectly to improved \n                                                 \n1  VMPCF\u2019s  detailed  recommended  nature  and  mechanisms  are  included  in  the  consultant  report  by  Coffey \nInternational Development Ltd. 2007.
