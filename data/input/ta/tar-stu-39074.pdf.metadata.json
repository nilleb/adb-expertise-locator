A regional meeting of the heads of offices for planning and for statistics, entitled Creating \na Culture of Evidence-Based Policy Making, was held in Noumea, New Caledonia, in April 2005. \nDuring the meeting, the national statisticians as well as major funding agencies to the Pacific \ncountries discussed various approaches for identifying and addressing social statistics. The \nheads  of  planning,  and  heads  of  statistics  offices,  and  aid  agencies  agreed  to  an  Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) suggestion that a coordinated regional approach in conducting a \ndemographic and health survey (DHS) would be more cost-effective and efficient than each \nagency working separately. Participants generally agreed that ADB and the Secretariat for the \nPacific Community (SPC) would take the lead in coordinating efforts to conduct DHS. This \nunderstanding was confirmed at a round table meeting of development partners on DHS in \nSydney on 18 August 2005.1\n \n2.  A  general  consensus  was  reached\u2014with  planners  and  statisticians  from  Pacific \ndeveloping member countries (PDMCs)2 at the Noumea regional meeting and with development \npartners at the Sydney round table meeting\u2014about the critical need for regularly collecting \nimportant demographic and health sector data. Discussions during the Fact-Finding Mission and \nthe 2005 country programming missions (to date, Fiji Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, \nPalau, and Vanuatu) emphasized the need for enhancing and transferring skills and technical \ncompetence of public officials in conducting surveys, analyzing data, and formulating evidence-\nbased policy for basic social needs. A widespread support for conducting DHS in selected \nPDMCs was also confirmed.  \n \n3.  ADB\u2019s  Pacific  strategy\u2014Priorities  of  the  Poor:  A  Pacific  Strategy  for  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (2005\u20132009),\u2014 identifies improved availability and dissemination of quality \ndata on development issues as a key result area aligned to the third strategic objective of \npromoting effective development processes. The Pacific Strategy\u2019s second strategic objective is \nto enhance the supply of, and demand for, quality basic social services. Quality social statistics \nare essential to the formulation and implementation of relevant and responsive social sector \nstrategies. Accordingly, the proposed technical assistance (TA)3 is consistent with ADB\u2019s Pacific \nstrategy and country strategies and programs. The TA design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1, and the initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  It is widely acknowledged that socioeconomic analysis, policy making, and development \nplanning  in  the  Pacific  region  are  heavily  constrained  by  the  limited  availability  of  quality \nstatistics.  SPC\u2019s  Pacific  Islands  Regional  Millennium  Development  Goals  Report  2004 \nemphasizes the need to enhance the quality of social statistics, so as to improve the monitoring \nand reporting on countries\u2019 progress toward Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets and \non the effectiveness of countries\u2019 policies and development strategies. A recent report by the \nPacific  Financial  and  Technical  Assistance  Center  notes  that  \u201csocio-demographic  data \n                                                 \n1  Participants included representatives from ADB, Australian Aid for International Development, Australian Bureau of \nStatistics,  New  Zealand  Aid  for  International  Development,  Statistics  New  Zealand,  SPC,  United  Nations \nPopulation Fund, and World Bank. \n2  ADB's PDMCs are Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, Kiribati, Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), Federated States of \nMicronesia (FSM), Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu, and \nVanuatu. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 9 March 2005. \n ", "2   \nrepresent a high priority for national authorities and development agencies for monitoring social \nconditions and poverty issues.\u201d4  \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s past experience with statistics TAs suggests that a regional approach for data \ncollection could be more efficient than a country-by-country approach, since many PDMCs are \ntoo small to have the capacity to collect and maintain data. Financial and technical assistance \non a regional basis can provide an efficient means of conducting large-scale surveys that \ngenerate  high  priority  socio-demographic  data  while  alleviating  pressure  on,  and  building \ncapacity in, national statistical agencies. ADB provided such assistance recently through a \nregional TA\u2014Strengthening Poverty Analysis and Strategies.5 The proposed TA will build on \nADB\u2019s earlier support to strengthening demographic and health statistics, and will involve close \ncoordination with partner regional agencies. \n \n6.  The quality of surveys and analyses related to basic social services policy making will be \nensured and strengthened by (i) ensuring that each PDMC has conducted reasonably recent \ngood quality DHS; (ii) providing TA with components that focus on demographic and health-\nrelated issues; (iii) assisting in the questionnaire design, ensuring consistency, and harmonizing \ndefinitions, particularly those related to MDGs; and (iv) providing quality assurance for survey \ndesign and implementation on a regionally comparable basis. \n \n7.  Capacity  building  will  be  strengthened  through  participation  in  survey  activities \nconducted by the group of survey specialists. Capacity will also be strengthened for (i) better \nuse of collected data for identifying demographic and health-related basic social needs, (ii) \nusing the data to develop strategies for equitable growth and social poverty reduction, and (iii) \nlinking such strategies to national development strategies. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  to  enhance  formulation  and  monitoring  of  social \ndevelopment strategies. By supporting DHS, the TA will help in the review and measurement of \nprogress toward MDG target 4 (reduce child mortality), target 5 (improve maternal health), \ntarget  6  (combat  HIV/AIDS,6  malaria,  and  other  diseases),  and  other  health-related \nsubcategories  of  MDG.  The  TA  will  generate  and  disseminate  reliable  and  comparable \ndemographic and health data in the Pacific subregion.  \n \n9.  The TA will facilitate consultation with stakeholders to establish an information sharing \nand  coordination  mechanism  for  regional  social  data  collection,  analysis,  and  monitoring \nactivities. The TA will encourage the contribution of other development partners to build on, \nexpand, and extend the TA activities. \n \n10.  The TA will identify demographic and health-related data needs. Appropriate sampling \nmethodology  and  design  of  the  survey  will  also  be  developed.  Through  hands-on  survey \nexperiences, capacity for National Statistics Office (NSO) staff will be built. In addition, it has the \nadvantage of obtaining country-level data that are comparable and establishing midterm data for \n                                                 \n4  The only full-fledged DHS in the Pacific has been conducted in Papua New Guinea in 1996. \n5  ADB. 2003.

The demographic and health survey model has a tradition of \ntechnical excellence and produces internationally comparable measures of the health-related \nvariables, which include, but are not limited to, fertility, mortality, contraceptive use, maternal \nand child health, and other demographic indicators, potentially including topics such as sexually \ntransmitted diseases, anthropometry, child malnutrition, and access to health services. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA will build on the work of earlier regional TAs and work conducted by other \nagencies related to population and health data collection and analysis. The key activities include \n(i) developing, in consultation with stakeholders, appropriate new sampling methodology and \nsurvey instruments for PDMCs; (ii) undertaking surveys in pilot countries; (iii) mobilizing funding \nfrom other development agencies to participate in the survey activities and evidence-based \npolicy formulation; (iv) assisting NSO staff in reporting requirements on MDGs; and (v) assisting \nplanners to formulate an evidence-based social policy. \n \n12.  The  TA  will  develop  the  regional  survey  instruments  and  investigate  the  sampling \nmethodology of the Pacific DHS in selected PDMCs. A basic questionnaire will be developed, \nwhich will form the core of DHS questionnaire for the entire region. Country-specific modules \nwill be added in different countries, as needed. A team of consultants will build appropriate \nsurvey  instruments  for  the  Pacific.  The  survey  instruments  will  include  features  and \nspecifications to be incorporated in the design of the proposed DHS. At the same time, the \nconsultant  team  will  investigate  and  develop  a  cost-saving  sampling  scheme  for  island \neconomies. The study will also provide the detailed cost estimates under the proposed sampling \nmethodology to meet the proposed objectives. \n \n13.  Once the regional survey instruments are developed and pretested, the TA will support \nthe  DHS  in  at  least  three  pilot  countries  using  the  existing  government  structures.  The \nconsultants will ensure transfer of the technology of conducting such surveys to the local \ncounterparts.  In-country  TA  activities  will  comprise  the  following  major  groups:  (i)  project \nmanagement  and  logistics,  (ii)  questionnaire  development,  (iii)  sampling,  (iv)  staffing  and \ntraining, (v) data management, (vi) fieldwork, and (vii) analysis and dissemination. ADB will \nprovide assistance for each component of activities separately.  \n \n14.  Coded unit-record data will be made available by the particular Government to ADB and \nother interested parties, consistent with the rights of individuals to privacy, the property rights of \npersons in trade secrets, and confidential commercial or financial information. Demographic and \nhealth data will be used specifically for policy support and program planning by the Government. \nPublic use documentation will also be prepared. Both data and documentation will be publicly \nreleased after the publication of the technical reports under conditions agreed upon by the \nGovernment and ADB. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $1,000,000 equivalent. The TA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. Detailed cost estimates and the \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 3. \n ", "4   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The SPC will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The counterpart agencies will be the \nNSOs or the offices responsible for preparing demographic and health statistics in the selected \nPDMCs. The TA will be implemented for about 24 months starting November 2005, by a team of \nconsultants comprising the public health specialist, a sampling and survey specialist, and an \neconomist. An international consulting firm will be engaged using the quality- and cost-based \nselection  method  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  The \nsimplified technical proposal procedure will apply. The terms of reference for the consultants are \nin Appendix 4. Any procurement under the TA will be conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. All equipment will be turned over to the counterpart agencies on \nthe completion of the TA. \n \n17.  The Project will start with the preparatory work of developing survey instruments and the \nsampling  methodology.  After  completion  of  the  project  preparation  component,  a  meeting \nbetween ADB and the consulting team will discuss the proposed survey report, the sampling \nstrategy  and  survey  instruments,  and  the  future  time  frame  for  project  processing  and \nimplementation. Once regional survey instruments are developed and pretested, the DHS will \nbe conducted by the team of consultants. \n  \n18.  The NSO of each selected PDMC will be nominated as the implementing agency (IA) for \nthe Project. The head of the IA will be the project director, and the IA will designate the project \nmanager for this Project, in consultation with the project director. The project management unit \n(PMU) within the IA for the Project, nominated by the project director, will support the day-to-day \noperations of the TA. The PMU will comprise the project manager and a team of consultants. \nThe PMU will also be responsible for the financial management of the survey. \n \n19.  The SPC, together with ADB, will work closely with the recipient Governments in all \nphases of the Project. If other funding agencies want to join at the later stage of the Project, \nsuitable arrangements will be worked out accordingly. The outputs resulting from the analysis of \nthe survey data will be made available to SPC and ADB, and will be placed in the public domain \nfor further investigation.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis \nfor the Demographic and Health Survey in Pacific Island Countries, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n ", "Appendix 1  5\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact      Assumptions \nEnhanced formulation  Progress toward MDG  Asian Development Bank  \u2022  Governments\u2019 \nand monitoring of social  targets 4, 5, and 6  (ADB) analysis of Pacific  continued commitment \ndevelopment strategies,    developing member  to achieving MDGs \nincluding progress  Building the capacity of  countries (PDMCs\u2019)   \ntoward Millennium  National Statistics  economies  \u2022  No major external \nDevelopment Goal  Office (NSO) officials    economic shocks \n(MDG) targets  for data collection and  Improvement in MDG   \n  dissemination  indicators \n   \nFormulation of \nevidence-based basic \nsocial services policy  \nOutcome      Assumptions \nGenerated and  Appropriate  ADB review missions and  \u2022  Commitments of PDMC \ndisseminated reliable  demographic and  reports from steering  governments and civil \ndemographic and  health data collected  committee  society organizations \nhealth data on a  and analyzed in the     \ncomparative basis in  majority of PDMCs  Records of national  \u2022  Commitment of \nthe Pacific subregion    statistics offices and other  governments and civil \n  Improvements in  key data producers  society organizations to \n  coverage, reliability,    use poverty data to \nand timeliness of  Feedback from social and  inform policy and \ndemographic and  health policy and planning  program development \nhealth statistics   offices    \n    \u2022  Availability of adequate \nGreater interaction and  Consultation with and  human and financial \nregional cooperation on  feedback from other  resources \nstatistics among the  agencies   \nparticipating PDMCs    \u2022  Support from \n  Review of official  government \npublications and reports \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
