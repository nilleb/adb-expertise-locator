INTRODUCTION \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) responds to a Government of India request to the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  for  support  to  prepare  the  master  plan  for  the  Vizag\u2013Chennai \nIndustrial Corridor (VCIC).1 The VCIC is the initial development along the East Coast Economic \nCorridor  (ECEC),  India\u2019s  first  coastal  corridor.  ADB  fielded  consultation  missions,  and  an \nagreement  with  the  government  was  reached  on  the  TA  design  and  implementation \narrangements.2 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  India\u2019s manufacturing remains relatively underdeveloped compared to its Asian peers. In                \n2013, the share of manufacturing value added to gross domestic product in India was 17.3%3 \ncompared with 32.9% in Thailand, 31.8% in the People\u2019s Republic of China, and 23.7% in \nIndonesia.4 Major constraints to realizing the full potential of the manufacturing sector are poor \ninfrastructure facilities and systems. The most visible signs of lagging infrastructure are seen in \nthe transport system (roads and rails), power grid, and water and sewerage system. Although \nthe country has the world\u2019s largest road network of about 48.89 million kilometers, roads remain \ninsufficient.5 The country also faces unreliable and deficient power supply.6 In addition, it is \nencountering water supply and management problems partly because of depletion of surface \nwater and groundwater.7 India must address these supply bottlenecks to boost the sector. \n \n3.   Recognizing the importance of a more dynamic manufacturing sector, the government in \n2011  unveiled  the  National  Manufacturing  Policy,  which  aims  to  increase  the  share  of \nmanufacturing in gross domestic product to 25.0% and create 100 million jobs by 2022. The \ngovernment also launched in September 2014 its \u201cMake in India\u201d initiative to attract international \nbusinesses to invest and manufacture in India, contributing to economic growth and job creation.  \n \n4.   To help fulfill the national economic policy and strategic objectives of increasing the \nmanufacturing  share  and  creating  jobs,  the  government  also  initiated  developing  industrial \ncorridors that will stimulate economic activities through integration of domestic urban (\u201cnew \nsmart cities\u201d) and industrial clusters, and connect its manufacturing base with regional value \nchains and global production networks. \n \n5.  South  Asia  is  one  of  the  least  economically  integrated  regions  in  the  world,  with \ncomparatively higher barriers to trade and investment. Therefore, a new approach to boosting \njob  creation  by  strengthening the manufacturing  sector  is  badly  needed  to realize  the full \npotential of the \u2018demographic dividend.\u2019 Integrated planning for transforming manufacturing and \npromoting  urbanization  should  be  the  approach  going  forward.  In  view  of  this,  economic \ncorridors, comprising global manufacturing and commercial hubs that are self-contained, state-\nof-the-art and industrial cities, need to be developed. Economic corridor essentially involves the \ncreation of an efficient multimodal transport network within a defined geography, supported by \n                                                \n1 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 May 2015. \n2 The vice president for Operations 1 approved the TA concept paper on 23 April 2015. \n3 This was lower than the 2011 figure of 18.1%. \n4 World Bank.

The ECEC is the first coastal corridor to be implemented in India with initial focus on the \nVCIC, an industrial corridor between Visakhapatnam (Vizag), an important tourist destination in \nAndhra Pradesh, and Chennai. It is also the first economic corridor to be developed under the \nSouth Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Program.8 \n \n7.  The ECEC is aligned with India\u2019s Golden Quadrilateral and is poised to play a critical \nrole in India\u2019s \u201cAct East Policy,\u201d a proactive initiative focused on increasing the integration of the \nIndian economy with the economies of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The ECEC\u2019s \nport-based connectivity stands out as it hosts several ports along the east coast, which would \nserve not only as international gateways, but more importantly as potential critical links in supply \nchains. The VCIC\u2019s approach of node-based development would help drive the growth of high \npotential industries supported by a multimodal transport network linking demand centers, urban \nclusters, and international gateways.  \n \n8.  The master plan for the VCIC is the third and final phase of the development of the VCIC \nfollowing the conceptual development plan (CDP) and the regional perspective plan (RPP). The \npreparation of the CDP and the RPP are being implemented under R-PATA 8254.9 The CDP, \nwhich was submitted to the government of India in November 2014, focused on crafting a \nstrategy for industrial transformation of the VCIC by identifying the key industries that will drive \ngrowth and the nodes in which they will be strategically located, taking into account land \navailability. The RPP, which is expected to be finished in December 2015, focuses on the \nassessment of the current status of the various sectors of the VCIC, and the identification of the \ndemand and supply gap in each sector. The master plan will focus on the development of the \nsectors for each of the four industrial nodes. It will guide government agencies on how to initiate \nthe development of the VCIC. \n \n9.  Improved connectivity and adequate urban infrastructure are crucial to strengthen India\u2019s \nindustrial base. However, building infrastructure alone is not sufficient. To reinforce the \u201cMake in \nIndia\u201d initiative, the government launched the \u201cSkill India\u201d program in March 2015. This program \nwill  establish  an  international-equivalent  skill  development  framework,  creating  workforce \nmobility and enhancing youth employability. Major initiatives were also undertaken in 2014 in \nline with improving business climate by simplifying and rationalizing business-related regulations, \nand broadening information technology use to make governance more efficient and effective. \n\u201cDigital India,\u201d launched in July 2015, is another initiative that integrates the government\u2019s \ndepartments to promote effective governance and accessibility of services. The implementation \nof the master plan of the VCIC poses significant additional tasks for staff of national and local \ngovernment agencies involved in economic corridor development and management.10 The TA \n                                                \n8 The South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Program is a project-based economic cooperation program \namong Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Priority sectors include transport, energy, \nand trade facilitation. \n9 R-PATA  8254  (Enhancing  Economic  Analysis  and  South  Learning)  is  a  technical  assistance  (TA)  being \nimplemented by SARD with the objective of helping decision makers from South Asian developing member \ncountries make better-informed policies on critical economic and social issues, and encouraged them to learn from \none another\u2019s development experiences, and those of other regions. The TA\u2019s analytical work on economic corridor \ndevelopment paved the way for initiating the development of the Vizag\u2212Chennai Industrial Corridor (VCIC). \n10 Aside from East Coast Economic Corridor (ECEC) and the Vizag\u2212Chennai Industrial Corridor (VCIC), there are \nother industrial corridors being developed in India. These include Delhi\u2013Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC), \nChennai\u2013Bengaluru Industrial Corridor (CBIC), Bengaluru\u2013Mumbai Economic Corridor (BMEC), and Amritsar\u2013\nKolkata Industrial Corridor (AKIC). \n ", "   3 \n \nwill provide the necessary capacity building activities to these government staff to ensure that \nthey have the necessary skills and knowledge to implement the development process of the \nindustrial nodes of the VCIC.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be improved readiness for implementation of the VCIC in line with the \n\u201cMake in India\u201d initiative. The outcome will be improved capacity of government agencies on \neconomic corridor development and management. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA has two major outputs with corresponding activities: \n \n(i)  Preparatory work for the development of the East Coast Economic Corridor \ninitiated. This, through master planning for VCIC, will involve (a) analysis of the \ncurrent infrastructure and identification of supply gaps for projected demands \narising from the forecasted industrial growth in the four nodes, (b) identification of \na suitable regulatory structure that will guide national and local governments in \nmanaging the four nodes, and (c) formulation of strategies to engage foreign \ninvestors already operating elsewhere in India11. Master planning will also include \nprospects  for  establishing  technological  partnerships  with  countries  such  as \nJapan, the People\u2019s Republic of China, the Republic of Korea, and Singapore for \ninvestment  in  research  and  development,  as  well  as  procurement  of  cost-\neffective technologies for modernizing the manufacturing sector. For the analysis \nof industry potentials, the top manufacturing industries for which foreign direct \ninvestment has been made may be considered.  \n \n(ii)  Training  program  on  economic  corridor  development  and  management \nimplemented. This will include assessing the training needs of government staff \non  economic  corridor  management.  Training  programs  will  be  designed  to \nenhance the government agencies\u2019 technical capacity in corridor and cluster \nmanagement and master plan implementation. Programs will also include project \nadministration-related  issues  (including  procurement,  disbursement,  and \nsafeguards). To serve as training reference material, a compendium of guidelines \non master plan implementation will be prepared and provided to government \nstakeholders.  \n \n12.  The TA risk is the change in political leadership with a different development agenda that \nhas  the  potential  to  discontinue  the  economic  corridor  development  policy.  Continuous \nconsultations  with  national  and  local  stakeholders  will  address  this  risk.  Dissemination \nworkshops  will  be  regularly  conducted  so  stakeholders  are  informed  on  master  plan \ndevelopments. The project has no anticipated social or environmental constraints or concerns \n                                                \n11 Node is defined here as an agglomeration of existing and planned special economic zones and industrial parks. \nFor the VCIC, the conceptual development plan (CDP) identified four strategic industrial areas to be developed, \nnamely (i) Vizag node, (ii) Kakinada node, (iii) Kankipadu-Gannavaram node and (iv) Yerpedu-Sri kalahasti node. \nThe four industrial nodes were selected in consultation with Andhra Pradesh government officials and based on the \nfollowing criteria: (i) locations with land in excess of 500 acres or having 2,000 acres of land in close proximity of \nless than 30\u221235 kilometers; (ii) availability of ground water; (iii) land distance from commercial and residential \nzones, forests, and restricted and flood line areas; and (iv) existing industrial agglomeration (Re1,000 crores of \ninvestment since 2000 within a 50-kilometer radius). A crore is a unit of value equal to Re10 million or 100 lakhs. \n ", "4            \n \nregarding public finance management, procurement, or corruption. However, since the master \nplan  will  include  a  proposed  infrastructure  development  that  may  have  impact  on  the \nenvironment, safeguard measures will also be identified to ensure that the master plan will be \ncompliant to the standards. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $2.03 million, of which $2.0 million will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  and  administered  by  ADB.  The \ngovernment will provide counterpart support in the form of workshop venues, transportation, \nremuneration and per diem of counterpart staff that will support master plan preparation, and \nother in-kind contributions. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The project will be implemented over 2 years, from September 2015 to September 2017. \nTo ensure continuity, ADB will implement the TA and oversee the master plan\u2019s preparation and \ncompletion. ADB will closely coordinate with the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion \nand Japan International Cooperation Agency, and consult with the State Government of Andhra \nPradesh and other government agencies, central and local, involved in this TA during the \ncourse of its implementation.  \n \n15.  A  project  steering  committee  will  be  established  to  provide  guidance  during  TA \nimplementation. It will be headed by the joint secretary of the Department of Industrial Policy \nand  Promotion  and  consist  of  the  ADB  project  team  leaders  and  economists,  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency representative, and representatives from relevant ministries, \nsupporting agencies, and the State Government of Andhra Pradesh. Day-to-day TA operations \nwill be monitored by ADB. \n \n16.  An international consulting firm will be hired to prepare the master plan. The firm will be \ncomposed  of  specialists  in  infrastructure,  transportation,  urbanization,  and  energy,  among \nothers.  The  consulting  firm  will  also  include  a  team  leader  who  will  have  the  overall \nresponsibility of ensuring the quality of the master plan and timely submission of reports. A \ncommunication specialist will be engaged to prepare the communication plan of the VCIC while \nthe training specialists will be engaged to provide capacity building activities to government \nagencies  on  economic  corridor  development  and  management.  Economists  outside  of  the \nconsulting firm will also be engaged to help in reviewing the outputs to be submitted by the \nconsulting  firm  and  identify  research  gaps  that  may  be  conducted  to  further  improve  the \ndevelopment of the VCIC.

ADB will engage consultants following the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, \nas amended from time to time). ADB will engage a consulting firm through quality- and cost-\nbased selection method. Firms will use a simplified technical proposal. Individual consultants \nwill be engaged through individual consultant selection, and output-based contracts will be \nconsidered. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. TA disbursement \nwill  be  made  following  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  All  procurement  will  be  done  following  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time).  \n \n18.  Monthly progress reports will be required from the consulting firm for submission to the \nproject steering committee. ADB will monitor report submissions from the consulting firm and \nindividual consultants. A TA completion report, evaluating achievement against targeted outputs, \nwill be submitted at the end of the project. \n \n19.  Good  practices  and  lessons  learned  will  be  disseminated  through  workshops  and \nseminars, as well as websites of ADB and Indian government agencies. \n \nIV.
