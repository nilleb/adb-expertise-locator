I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed equity \ninvestment of $75 million or CNY equivalent in the Bank of China Ltd. (BOC), a state-owned \ncommercial bank (SOCB) in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), as a key step in the financial \nreform of the PRC banking sector.    \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Industry Background and Sector Reform \n \n1.  Overview of PRC Financial System and State-Owned Commercial Banks \n \n2.  Banks clearly dominate the PRC\u2019s financial system and at present account for 54% of the \ntotal assets of all financial institutions in the PRC.1 In 2005, the PRC\u2019s banking system comprises \nfour nationwide SOCBs, 12 nationwide joint-stock commercial banks, 112 city commercial banks, \n8 rural commercial banks, about 2,000 urban credit cooperatives, and about 28,000 rural credit \ncooperatives.2 Assets of these financial institutions have grown at a compounded annual growth \nrate (CAGR) of 13% since 2000 and stood at $3.8 trillion at the end of 2004, about the same as \nthe assets of the United Kingdom\u2019s financial sector (Figure 1).  \n \n  Figure 1: PRC Banking Industry Assets 2000\u20132004 \n4.00  3.8\n3.50  3.4\n3.00  2.7 2.8\n2.4 \n2.50 \n$ trillion \n2.00 \n1.50 \n1.00  2.0 \n1.7 1.8\n1.4  1.5\n0.50 \n0.00 \n2000  2001 2002 2003 2004 \n \nState-owned banks Others Joint-stock banks City commercial bank\n \nSource: KPMG analysis. \n \n \n3.  The ratio of bank assets to stock market capitalization plus bonds outstanding in the PRC \nexceeds 300%, a far higher ratio than in most industrial countries and even in many developing \ncountries. For example, India, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, and the United States all have ratios \nless than 100%. \n                                            \n \n1  China Banking Regulatory Commission. 2004. Presentation at ADB\u2019s 37th Annual Meeting, Republic of Korea, May \n2004.  \n2  Source: KPMG research.  \n ", "2   \n \n4.  The banking industry is controlled by the four SOCBs: the Industrial and Commercial Bank \nof China (ICBC), BOC, the China Construction Bank (CCB) and the Agricultural Bank of China \n(ABC). Their combined assets as of year-end 2004 were CNY16.9 trillion. This represented \n53.6% of total financial system resources, 69.5% of total domestic bank assets, and 130% of \ngross domestic product (GDP). The four SOCBs also accounted for about 90% of all loans to \nstate-owned enterprises (SOEs) and 70% of all loans to state-controlled infrastructure projects. \nThe SOCBs play a major role in the allocation of funds throughout the economy as well as \nserving as an important gauge of the overall health of the financial system.  \n \nB.  Financial Sector Reforms  \n \n5.  The PRC banking sector was originally regulated by the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC). \nSince 1998, responsibilities have been divided between PBOC and the China Banking Regulatory \nCommission (CBRC). PBOC, guided by the State Council, is responsible for formulating and \nimplementing monetary policy and for enacting safeguards to ensure financial stability. CBRC is \nthe main regulator of the banking sector and its responsibilities include formulating and enforcing \nthe supervisory rules and regulations governing bank institutions. \n \n6.  The PRC regulators place numerous restrictions on permissible products, services, and \nactivities of domestic and foreign banks. For example, there are still restrictions on commercial \nbanks offering fee-based products. Interest rates on loans and deposits offered by commercial \nbanks are still subject to PBOC regulations even after recent reform measures that gave banks \nmore latitude in setting such interest rates. On the other hand, the PRC Government has been \ngradually reforming the banking sector by allowing new product offerings and expanding the limits \nwithin which commercial banks may set their CNY lending rates. In particular, on 29 October \n2004, the PBOC removed the upper limit for CNY lending rates (other than rates on mortgage \nloans  to  individuals)  charged  by  financial  institutions,  excluding  credit  cooperatives,  while \nretaining the lower limit for such rates. Since that date, all deposit-taking institutions have been \npermitted to decrease (but not increase) CNY deposit rates to below the corresponding PBOC \nbenchmark rates. These changes give banks more freedom to develop products to meet market \nneeds and to offer more flexibility in determining pricing of their products. \n \n7.  Despite focused monetary and financial sector reforms,3  the PRC financial sector does \nnot yet meet the needs of a market economy. Indirect monetary policy instruments (e.g., open \nmarket  operations)  are  not  fully  developed  and  interest  rate  policy  remains  inflexible.4 The \nregulatory and supervisory framework for banks and nonbank financial institutions remains weak. \nDespite substantial progress, the capital markets are still underdeveloped and have not been \nadequately regulated and supervised. 5  \n \n8.  A developed financial system mobilizes investments, manages risks, and reduces the cost \nof doing business. An inefficient financial system restricts economic growth by failing to fund \n                                            \n \n3  Among others, adoption of the Central Bank and Commercial Bank Laws in 1995, Securities Law in 1999, \nestablishment  of  China  Securities  Regulatory  Commission  and  China  Insurance  Regulatory  Commission  as \nindependent regulators, setting up four asset management companies to help address NPL problems, allowing more \nforeign participation in the financial sector and separating CBRC from PBOC in 2003, finalizing the transfer of \nPBOC\u2019s formerly all-encompassing regulatory powers over the financial services industry.  \n4  In April 2004 it was announced that the hitherto regulated commercial interest rate would be liberalized and that the \ninterest rate ceiling for commercial lending would be removed (while certain floor rates would remain). \n5  PRC did not have a capital market until early 1990s. ", "  3 \nworthwhile projects and businesses, and by misdirecting funds to less productive investors and \nborrowers. High transaction costs result in low economic benefits. The PRC\u2019s banking system \nhas not yet developed into playing an efficient role in intermediation.  \n \n9.  To  address  these  problems,  the  PRC  is  undertaking  a  historic  transformation  of  its \nbanking and financial sector. The three central pillars of this transformation are: (i) reducing NPLs, \nparticularly in the SOCBs;6 (ii) restructuring the SOCBs to make them more commercially viable \nand to avoid new NPLs; and (iii) promoting a stronger credit culture and competitiveness in the \nbanking and financial sector as a whole to prepare for market shifts, such as interest rate \nliberalization and local currency operations by foreign banks. The success of these interlinked \nmeasures will determine the ability of the PRC to generate the positive and sustainable credit \nexpansion needed to fuel the growing economy.  \n \n1.  World Trade Organization Accession and Competition from Foreign Banks \n \n10.  The PRC\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) further emphasizes the \nurgency of SOE and financial sector reform, especially with respect to the four SOCBs. Given that \nWTO entry effectively opens the PRC\u2019s financial sector to foreign participants, the PRC\u2019s financial \ninstitutions will face increasing competition and challenges.  \n \n11.  In an attempt to penetrate the growing and lucrative PRC banking market, foreign financial \ninstitutions have invested in several PRC banks over the past few years. Although the pace of \nthese  investments  has  increased,  it  is  worth  noting  that  so  far  they  have  been  limited  to \ninvestments in city banks and joint-stock banks.7 No foreign investment in any of the SOCBs has \nyet reached financial closure.  \n \n2.  SOCB Restructuring and Corporatization \n \n12.  Given the dominant role that the four SOCBs have in the overall PRC financial system, \nthe Government can not afford to put the survival of the four SOCBs at risk. Therefore, in an \nattempt  to  prepare  for  future  competition  from  foreign  banks  and  to  respond  to  the  other \nchallenges faced by the four banks, the Government has increased its support for shareholder \nreform. It selected BOC as one of two SOCBs to be restructured into joint stock companies 8 and \nto undergo major corporate restructuring. \n \nC.  Trends in the PRC Banking Industry \n \n1.  Economic Growth Has Led to Growing Demand for Banking Products \n \n13.  The PRC\u2019s GDP increased from $150 billion in 1980 to $1.8 trillion in 2005, with an \naverage annual growth of 9.4%. Its foreign trade rose during the same period from $20 billion to \n$1.2 trillion, surpassing that of Japan. The PRC is currently the sixth largest economy in the world \nand its GDP growth continues to outpace those of other countries. If the average GDP growth of \n                                            \n \n6  To aid in the transformation and restructuring, the Government established four asset management companies \n(AMCs) in 1999. Cinda AMC is responsible for NPLs from the CCB and the China Development Bank (CDB), the \nHuarong AMC for the ICBC, the Orient AMC for the BOC, and the Great Wall AMC for the ABC. In the following \nyears, the SOCBs transferred a total of CNY1.37 trillion NPLs at face value to these AMCs. \n7  All of the investments have been minority equity stakes usually between 5\u201320%. PRC regulations regarding foreign \ninvestment limit any one foreign investor to 20% and foreign investors in aggregate to 25% equity stakes in a \ndomestic financial institution.   \n8  The other one is CCB. \n ", "4   \nthe last 10 years continues, by 2010 the PRC could become the fourth largest economy in the \nworld, surpassing the United Kingdom and France; by 2015 it could be the third largest economy, \nsurpassing Germany. The PRC is rated A- by Standard & Poor\u2019s and A2 by Moody\u2019s. \n \n14.  This economic growth has substantially increased per capita income. In particular, the per \ncapita annual disposable income of urban households has risen significantly over the past 3 \nyears (Table 1). Such growth will foster a growing demand for banking products and services.  \n \nTable 1: Key Economic Data \n \n  Compound Annual \n  Growth Rate \nAs of the year ended 31 December   \nItem  2000  2001  2002  2003  2004  (2000\u20132004) \nNominal GDP (CNY billion)  8,947  9,731 10,240 11,669 13,652 a 11.1% \nReal GDP growth (%)  8.0  7.3 8.0 9.1 9.5 a \u2014 \nPopulation (in millions)  1,267  1,276 1,285 1,292 \u2014  \u2014 \nGDP per capita (CNY)  7,086  7,651 7,997 9,032 \u2014  \u2014 \nPer capita annual  6,280  6,860 7,703 8,472   9,422  10.7% \ndisposable income of urban \nhouseholds (CNY) \n \u2014 = not available, GDP = gross domestic product. \na Based on preliminary estimates by the National Bureau of Statistics of the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n Source: National Bureau of Statistics of the PRC. \n \n15.  Loans by and deposits with financial institutions have grown rapidly. Loans grew at a \nCAGR of 15.0% from 1999 to 2004 (Table 2). The CAGR for deposits was 18.4% for the same \nperiod.  \n \nTable 2: Loan Growth \n \nYear on Year  Year on Year \nYear  Total Loans (1)  Total Deposits a \nGrowth  Growth \n  CNY billion  CNY (%)  CNY billion  CNY (%) \n1999  9,373    8.3  10,878  13.7 \n2000  9,937    6.0  12,380  13.8 \n2001  11,231  13.0  14,362  16.0 \n2002  13,129  16.9  17,092  19.0 \n2003  15,900  21.1  20,806  21.7 \n2004  18,857  18.6  25,319  21.7 \na  Includes the loans or deposits of the People\u2019s Bank of China, the largest four commercial banks, joint-stock \ncommercial banks, rural credit cooperatives, urban commercial banks, financial institutions with foreign investments, \nurban credit cooperatives, policy banks, financing companies, leasing companies and the PRC Post. \nSource: PBOC. \n \n2.  Corporate Lending and Growing Demand for Retail Banking Products \n \n16.  Corporate banking will remain the primary focus of the PRC banking industry in the near \nto midterm future, because of the sheer demand and growth potential. PRC corporations are the \ngrowth engine of the country\u2019s economic development. In the past, a large majority of loans by \nPRC financial institutions have been made to SOEs, a trend which will change as financial \nreforms  continue.  In  addition,  newly  founded  privately-owned  corporations  are  becoming \nincreasingly important borrowers. \n ", "  5 \n17.  As the PRC banking industry has been reformed, banking institutions have been allowed \nto offer consumer lending products. Rising incomes are likely to foster growing consumer demand \nfor banking products and services. It is anticipated that retail banking will continue to grow, with \nincreasing demands for mortgages and other consumer loans. According to the National Bureau \nof Statistics, consumer loans in the PRC totaled CNY2.0 trillion in 2004, representing 10.5% of \ntotal loans and 14.6% of GDP, and grew at a compound annual growth rate of 36.5% from 2002 \nto 2004. \n \n18.  Mortgage loans represented the majority of overall consumer loans in 2003, and were \nfueled by the Government\u2019s efforts to reform the housing system, under which employees of \nstate-owned enterprises previously received free or subsidized housing. Mortgage loans have \ngrown rapidly from CNY609.9 billion in 2001 to over CNY1.2 trillion in 2003, according to the \nMinistry of Construction. \n \n19.  The vast majority of bank cards in the PRC are debit cards. There are approximately \n517,000 credit and points-of-sale and 67,000 automated teller machines (ATMs) in the PRC. The \ncredit  card  market  has  so  far  been  limited  for  a  variety  of  reasons,  including  the  limited \nacceptance of cards by merchants, the underdevelopment of a national payment infrastructure, \nand the absence of a nationwide consumer credit information system. According to the PRC \nUnionpay, an electronic interbank information exchange and transaction network, at the end of \n2004, 815 million banking cards had been issued in the PRC, only 11 million of which were credit \ncards. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  The Investee Company \n \n20.  Established in 1921, BOC is the second largest of the PRC\u2019s four SOCBs as ranked by \ntotal assets. After the founding of the PRC in 1949, BOC was restructured to specialize in \ninternational trade finance. At the same time, its operations were merged into the new central \nbank, PBOC. In 1979, at the onset of PRC\u2019s economic reforms, BOC was separated from the \nPBOC and became the PRC\u2019s designated foreign exchange bank. Today, traditional commercial \nbanking constitutes the majority of BOC\u2019s business, which comprises corporate banking, retail \nbanking,  and  banking  with  financial  institutions.  In  line  with  the  developing  trends  in  the \ninternational financial industry, BOC has strengthened its commercial banking business while \nexpanding its investment banking and insurance activities.  \n \n21.  BOC  operates  11,307  domestic  branches  and  603  overseas  branches,  and  has \nsubsidiaries in 27 countries and regions around the world. At the end of 2003, it had more than \n188,000 staff. Domestic lending represents about three quarters of its gross loans and over 80% \nof domestic loans are corporate loans (about half of which are to SOEs). BOC also dominates \nforeign exchange services and accounts for about 50% of PRC\u2019s foreign currency deposit market.  \n \n22.  BOC has the most extensive global network of the PRC\u2019s banks. It maintains a significant \npresence in Hong Kong, China, and in Macau, China. Its subsidiary, Bank of China (Hong Kong) \nLimited (BOCHK), is the second largest banking group in Hong Kong, China, with approximately \n17% of the domestic deposit market at the end of 2003.9 BOCHK\u2019s financial performance is the \n                                            \n \n9 In 2001, BOC successfully restructured its operations in Hong Kong by merging 10 of its member banks into BOCHK, \na locally registered bank. In July 2002, BOCHK listed successfully on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The $2.8 \nbillion offering was over-subscribed by 7.5 times, indicating strong support not only for BOCHK but also for the \n ", "6   \nstrongest in the BOC group. In 2003, the combined Hong Kong, China, and Macau, China, \noperations accounted for 22.5% of total assets of the Group, and 23.8% of total operating profit \nbefore provisions. In 2004, these operations accounted for 23.1% of total assets, and 38.3% of \ntotal operating profit before provisions. \n \n23.  In December 2003, the Government injected $22.5 billion10 of fresh capital into BOC. \nBefore this capital injection, the entire balance of BOC\u2019s shareholders\u2019 equity was transferred to \nprovisions to absorb write-offs of NPLs. BOC issued CNY26.07 billion in subordinated debt in \n2004 to further strengthen its regulatory capital adequacy ratio and to fund its future growth. \n \n24.  BOC is rated BBB- by Standard & Poor\u2019s. The rating reflects the Government support as \ndemonstrated by the capital injection in 2003, BOC\u2019s sale of problem loans, and reform initiatives \nby the bank itself, all of which have led to considerable improvements in BOC\u2019s financial profile.  \n \n25.  In August 2004, BOC announced that it had reorganized itself into a joint-stock company, \n100% owned by Central SAFE Investments Ltd. (SAFE). SAFE is a state owned company set up \nat the end of 2003 to hold the shares in BOC on behalf of the PRC Government. The new \ncompany has taken over the assets and liabilities, claims, and employees of the former BOC and \nmaintains its business scope.  \n \n26.  BOC has used its former international focus to take a leading position among the PRC \nbanks. Domestically, it has strong market share in the PRC and in Hong Kong, China, and Macau, \nChina. It also occupies niche positions in other overseas markets and has the largest overseas \nbranch network of all PRC banks.  \n \nIV.  PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \n27.  BOC has been negotiating with a number of potential investors, including ADB, on the \nsale of a strategic equity stake. \n \n28.  ADB\u2019s  exact  shareholding  will  be  a  function  of  the  yet-to-be  finalized  pricing.  Exact \nvaluation and resulting shareholding of ADB remains subject to negotiation. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Justification for the ADB Investment  \n \n1.  Investment Rationale \n \n29.  It is a consensus view among academic researchers that the main underlying cause of the \n1997 Asian financial crisis was related to the poor quality of the affected countries\u2019 financial \ninstitutions. There is therefore concern about the capacity of the PRC banking system and \nespecially of its dominant players, the four SOCBs. Strengthening the financial system to promote \nefficient  resource  utilization  will  be  fundamental  to  restructuring  industry,  achieving  better \n                                                                                                                                               \n \ncorporatization and listing of PRC state-owned commercial banks in general. Shortly after the listing, BOCHK was \nincluded into key international benchmarks such as the MSCI Hong Kong Index, signifying the importance of the \nbank in global financial markets. The deal was a landmark in the development of the BOC and a significant move in \nthe reform of the PRC\u2019s banking industry. This became a key channel for BOC to introduce modern commercial \nbanking practices into the PRC. BOC continues to hold a 65.91% equity stake in BOCHK. \n10  The capital injection was made from the PRC Government\u2019s foreign exchange reserves. ", "  7 \nintegration among regions, bolstering macroeconomic performance, and allowing the PRC to \nopen its financial markets to the world without risking undue financial instability. Despite the \nimportant steps taken over recent years, the fundamental capabilities and incentives of the \nfinancial system to allocate credit efficiently remain impaired. \n \n30.  The PRC Government has decided to partially restructure BOC through strategic sales of \nequity stakes, followed by an IPO. It believes that such strategic investors will ensure that best \npractices in terms of corporate governance, management, credit and technology are transferred \nto BOC. The PRC\u2019s accession to the WTO and the expected increase in foreign competition has \nheightened the importance of equipping BOC with such practices.  \n \n2.  Development Impact and Effectiveness \n \n31.  The  proposed  investment  will  promote  best  credit  and  governance  practices.  BOC\u2019s  \nrestructuring will serve as a demonstration model and will catalyze reforms and restructuring \nwithin  other  financial  institutions.  Broad-based  restructuring  in  the  financial  sector  will  be \nnecessary as the PRC prepares for intensified competition from foreign players entering the \nfinancial sector as a result of WTO accession. \n \n3.  Value Added of the Asian Development Bank \n \n32.  ADB\u2019s proposed investment in BOC will add value by (i) providing direct support for \ncorporate governance and implementation of safeguards, and (ii) supporting financial sector \nreform in the PRC. \n \nB.  Asian Development Bank Sector and Country Strategies \n \n33  ADB\u2019s strategy in the PRC financial sector focuses on supporting the PRC Government to \nestablish a conducive policy and institutional framework and an efficient market infrastructure for \nthe financial markets. The role of the financial sector in delivering ADB\u2019s operational objectives is \ncritical, particularly in areas of poverty reduction, governance, and private sector development.11 \n \n34.  ADB\u2019s  PRC  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP)  aims  to  address  poverty  primarily \nthrough pro-poor economic growth, which has at its center the enhancement of markets by \npromoting  good  governance  and  expanding  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  operations,  especially  in \npreparation for the intensified competition in the financial sector brought about by the WTO \naccession.  \n \n35.  The  CSP  recommends  that  ADB  should  enhance  governance  by  (i)  encouraging \ngovernment agencies, SOEs and  financial institutions to adopt sound corporate governance \nstandards in harmony with international best practices; (ii) strengthening the legal, regulatory, and \nsupervisory  framework,  and  the  institutional  capabilities  of  financial  market  regulators, \nsupervisors, industry associations, and individual banks and other financial institutions; and (iii) \nsetting minimum criteria for sound corporate governance standards by market participants. In \naddition, and with respect to ADB\u2019s private sector operations, the CSP makes specific reference \nto  ADB  taking  equity  positions  in  domestic  financial  institutions  to  promote  financial  sector \n                                            \n \n11 ADB. 2003.

Manila. \n ", "8   \nreforms  and  good  corporate  governance.12 The  proposed  investment  and  its  objectives  are \ntherefore fully in line with the current CSP.   \n \nC.  Private Sector Operations Department Strategic Approach \n \n36.  Within ADB, the Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD), the East and Central \nAsia Governance and Finance Division (ECGF), and the PRC Resident Mission (PRCM) have \nworked closely together with respect to financial sector reforms in the PRC. ADB public sector\u2019s \nactivities  have  been  focused  on  policy  dialogue  with  the  PRC  Government  and  knowledge \ntransfer, while PSOD has concentrated on private sector transactions. The two approaches work \nhand-in-hand and complement each other.  \n \nD.  Poverty Reduction \n \n37.  The proposed investment is in line with ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy.13 The strategy \nstates that ADB seeks to promote \u201csound and efficient banking systems and capital markets,\u201d \nsince these are seen as \u201cindispensable for macroeconomic stability, mobilizing savings, and \nensuring availability of long-term financing, an essential requirement for pro-poor growth.\u201d This is \nsupported by a recent United Nations report,14 which noted that \u201c[\u2026] it is impossible for a country \nto progress without domestic investment based on domestic savings. This requires financial \ninstitutions  that  can  effectively  manage  risk  and  allocate  capital  to  productive  investment.\u201d \nHowever, the report continues, a financial sector should have a high private sector participation, \nas best practices are typically driven by leading private sector banks. \n \n38.  The  financial  sector  is  the  most  effective  and  efficient  conduit  in  any  economy  for \nchanneling funds from savings and other sources of capital to companies and entrepreneurs who \ninvest the funds in projects and operations which create economic value and economic growth. \nFinance is the oil for the engines of growth. The financial system is the system of institutions and \noperations that enable financial resources to be put to productive use. The impact on poverty is \ntypically indirect, and takes place through the multiplier effects a functioning financial sector has \non the economy as a whole, including SMEs and other pro-poor growth-engines. Indirect effects \nenable the economy to function better, increase employment, improve the scale and efficiency of \ncapital  utilization,  and  lead  to  higher  labor  productivity  and  demand.15 In  the  PRC,  lack  of \nfinancing has been identified as the greatest perceived obstacle to doing business.16 \n \nE.  Environmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n \n39.  BOC has been classified as financial intermediary (FI) with respect to environmental \nconcerns. ADB has provided BOC with all applicable ADB policies and discussed their relevance \nand importance. BOC will be required to (i) adopt an appropriate environmental management \nsystem, consisting of a (a) policy and (b) procedures to ensure compliance with applicable local \nlaws; and (ii) undergo training in environmental impact assessment and auditing.  \n                                            \n \n12 This is emphasized again in ADB. 2005.

ASSURANCES \n42.  The proposed investment, which is PSOD\u2019s 10th in the PRC, would, once approved by the \nBoard, represent 5.0% of PSOD\u2019s total exposure,17 increase its investments (i) in the PRC by \n4.14%, from 9.79% of PSOD\u2019s total exposure to 13.93%, and (ii) in the financial sector from \n11.23% to 15.31%. The proposed investment is within acceptable aggregate, country, industry, \ngroup, and single project exposure limits for ADB\u2019s private sector projects. \n \n43.  ADB will not be the single largest investor and its investment will not exceed the 25% of \nproject cost limit nor the $75 million single transaction limit. \n \n44.  A framework agreement confirming ADB\u2019s status, privileges, and immunities with respect \nto its equity investments and lending operations in the private sector is in effect between the PRC \nand  ADB.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment  will  be  asked  to  confirm  that  it  has  no  objection  to  the  proposed  ADB  equity \ninvestment in BOC. No investment will be disbursed until ADB receives such confirmation. \n \n45.  ADB will enter into negotiated share purchase/subscription agreements, and other legally \nrequired documents, following approval of the proposed investment by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors. \nThese agreements will be on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. In addition, ADB will need \nto be satisfied with all terms and conditions of the other principal documents associated with the \nproposed investment. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n46.  I am satisfied that the proposed investment would comply with the Articles of Agreement \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and acting in the absence of the President, under the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove the equity investment of $75,000,000 or CNY equivalent for an equity stake in the Bank \nof China Ltd. from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, on terms and conditions substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in this report, and as will be reported to the Board. \n \n \n \nJoseph Eichenberger \nVice President, Operations 2 \n \n \n13 September 2005 \n \n                                            \n \n17  Exposure refers to drawn and undrawn portions of PSOD\u2019s committed loan, equity investments, and guarantees as \nof 30 June 2005.

Despite the monetary and financial sector reforms,2 the financial sector does \nnot meet the needs of a market economy. Indirect monetary policy instruments (e.g., open \nmarket  operations)  are  not  fully  developed  and  interest rate  policy  remains  inflexible.  The \nregulatory and supervisory framework for banks and nonbank financial institutions remains \nweak.  Despite  substantial  progress, 3  the  capital  markets  are  underdeveloped  and  not \nadequately regulated and supervised. Weaknesses in the banking sector, high levels of non-\nperforming loan (NPLs), incomplete state-owned enterprise (SOE) reforms, and incomplete \npension reforms remain causes of concern. The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC), the China \nSecurities  Regulatory  Commission  (CSRC),  the  China  Insurance  Regulatory  Commission \n(CIRC),  and  the  China  Banking  Regulatory  Commission  (CBRC)  are  placing  increased \nemphasis on improving corporate governance in the financial sector. \n \n2.  Banking. There are 4 state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs),4 3 policy banks,5 12 \njoint-stock banks, 112 city commercial banks, as well as foreign banks.6 Banking dominates the \nfinancial market with around 80% share in total assets.7 The profitability of SOCBs and the \npolicy banks is lower than what would be acceptable to commercial banks in a market economy. \nSOCBs and policy banks devote most of their lending to SOEs or designated development \nprojects, while the joint-stock and city commercial banks are more private sector-oriented and \nlend to SMEs.8 \n \n3.  Plans  have  been  announced  to  modernize  SOCBs  and  encourage  joint-stock \ncommercial banks to merge and restructure. The SOCBs will be corporatized as an initial step in \nthe restructuring process. They are at different stages of launching their restructuring initiatives. \nOver the last 4 years, they have closed more than 21,000 branch offices and shed more than \n100,000 personnel. The joint-stock commercial banks are now moving to list on the stock \nexchanges. \n \n4.  The five-category loan classification system was adopted at the end of 2001, after trial \ntesting  in  Guangdong  province.9 Commercial  banks  now  stop  interest  accrual  if  a  loan  is \noverdue by 90 days. Banks are requested to make adequate loan provisioning for bad debts.10 \nAccording to PBOC, the NPL level for the four SOCBs was 26.5% of the total loans as of the \nend of 2001. BOC is to reduce the NPL ratio to 15% by 2004 and to less than 10% by 2005\u2013\n2006.11 \n \n                                            \n1  ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program (2004\u20132006): People\u2019s Republic of China. Manila. \n2  Adoption of the Central Bank and Commercial Bank Laws in 1995; the ADB-supported Securities Law in 1999; \nestablishment  of  CBRC,  CSRC,  and  CIRC  as  independent  regulators;  setting  up  four  asset  management \ncompanies to help address the NPL problems, and allowing more foreign participation in the financial sector; and \nseparation of CBRC from PBOC in 2003. \n3  The PRC did not have a capital market until the early 1990s. \n4  Agriculture Bank of China, Bank of China, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and China Construction Bank. \n5  China Development Bank, Agricultural Development Bank of China, and Chine Export-Import Bank. \n6  There are 240 foreign bank representative offices, 160 branches of foreign banks, and 13 locally registered foreign \nbank subsidiaries. Over 30 foreign banks obtained licenses to conduct yuan business before WTO accession. \n7  As of 2000, banking sector deposits stood at CNY12 trillion (150% of GDP), while loans were below CNY10 trillion. \n8  Twelve percent of total SOCB lending was to private enterprises; 80% of non-SOCB lending went to small and \nmedium-sized enterprises. \n9  The five categories are standard, special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss. \n10 Although general provisioning before tax is allowed up to 1% of the total outstanding loans. \n11  Official estimates of NPLs are considered an underestimate by some foreign observers. \n ", "14  Appendix 3 \n5.  Capital Markets. Although the capitalization of the securities market continues to grow, \nSOEs  dominate  the  listed  firms.  About  70%  of  the  SOE  shares  are  nontradable.  The \ngovernment dominates the listed firms. The  government and regulators are exploring options to \nsell state shares without disrupting the markets and allow entry of foreign securities firms in line \nwith WTO accession agreement. \n    \n6.  While market forces will exert pressure on how listed enterprises are organized and \nmanaged, corporate governance of listed enterprises has the following weaknesses:  \n \n(i)  fragmented control structure for SOEs; \n \n(ii)  opaque ownership structures; \n \n(iii)  poor internal control arrangements, with generally dominant management and \nboard  of  directors,  weak  independent  board  of  supervisors,  and  inadequate \nprotection of minority shareholder rights; \n \n(iv)  low or no professional requirements for membership of boards; \n \n(v)  restrictions on resale of shares held by promoters and directors; and \n \n(vi)  poor disclosure practices, lack of transparency, poor accounting and auditing \npractices, and misleading or fraudulent financial statements. \n \n7.  Fundamental changes are needed to strengthen the capital market. The Securities Law, \nCompany  Law,  Trust  Law,  and  other  related  regulations  need  to  be  rationalized  to  clarify \nCSRC\u2019s investigative, enforcement, and disciplinary powers. However, the implicit preference \nfor listings by SOEs continues, despite the recent efforts to change the quota system. \n \n8.  State-Owned Enterprises. While the SOEs were the backbone of the PRC\u2019s economy \nduring the central planning era, their role in gross domestic product has declined over the last \ntwo  decades.12 The  financial  performance  of  some  SOEs  has  been  weak  due  to  poor \nmanagement, poor technology, political interference, poor investment decisions, soft budget \nconstraints, overemployment, heavy social welfare responsibilities, and lack of competitiveness. \nIn recent years, however, the performance of some SOEs has improved. \n \n9.  Beginning in 1997, the Government of the PRC launched a campaign to reform SOEs to \nrestructure large SOEs that were able to compete globally and privatize small ones. Thousands \nof smaller SOEs were sold, closed, or merged. About 26 million SOE workers were laid off in \n1998\u20132001.  Despite  the  corporatization  that  transformed  most  SOEs  into  limited  liability \ncompanies and about 1,000 SOEs being listed in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, \ncorporate governance standards of SOEs need substantial improvement. In 2002, the State \nEconomic and Trade Commission (SETC) and CSRC formulated codes of conduct for listed \nSOEs. No assessment has been made to verify the compliance of SOEs with these codes. \n \n10.  Rural  Finance.  The  rural  financial  system  comprises  a  policy  bank  (Agricultural \nDevelopment Bank of China), a commercial bank (Agricultural Bank of China), and the rural \ncredit cooperative (RCC) system. Over 28,000 RCCs account for 13% of deposits and 10% of \n                                            \n12  The contribution of SOEs to GDP fell from 58% in 1980 to 37% in 2000, and the share of the SOEs in gross \nindustrial output fell from 37% in 1994 to 25% in 2000, but they still account for 55% of employment. ", "  Appendix 3  15 \nloans of the banking sector, and 60% of agricultural loans. RCCs are controlled by various \nlevels  of  governments  to  channel  funds  to  SOEs,  township  and  village  enterprises  with \ngovernment connections, and government agencies such as the state grain bureaus. Rural \nhouseholds, especially those with low incomes, lack access to formal credit. Large numbers of \nrural households must turn to moneylenders, friends, or relatives in the informal credit market. \n \n \n \n \n ", "16  Appendix 4 \nMAJOR EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN THE PEOPLE\u2019S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\u2019S  \nFINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS BY FOREIGN STRATEGIC INVESTORSa \n(CNY million) \n \nPurchase \nAmount \n%  Price/Book \nDate  Investor  PRC Bank  (CNY \nStake  Value of Equity \nmillion) \n(multiple) \n           \nSept-99  International Finance  Bank of Shanghai  5.0  183  1.0 \nCorporation \nNov-01  International Finance  Bank of Nanjing  15.0  219  1.2 \nCorporation \nDec-01  HSBC  Bank of Shanghai  8.0  518  1.2 \nDec-01   Shacom  Bank of Shanghai  3.0  \u2014  \u2014 \nMar-02  International Finance  Bank of Shanghai  2.0  208  1.4 \nCorporation \nDec-02  Citibank  Pudong Development  5.0  600  1.5 \nDec-03  The Government of  Industrial Bank  5.0  540  1.5 \nSingapore Investment \nCorporation \nDec-03  International Finance  Industrial Bank  4.0  432  1.5 \nCorporation \nDec-03  Hang Seng Bank   Industrial Bank  16.0  1,726  1.5 \nJun-04  Newbridge Capital  Shenzhen Development  17.9  1,235  1.5 \nBank \nAug-04  HSBC  Bank of Communications  19.9  14,461  1.8 \nSep-04  Commonwealth Bank of  Jinan City Commercial  11.0  141  \u2014 \nAustralia  Bank \nNov-04  Standard Chartered  Tianjin Bohai Bank (new  20.0  \u2014  \u2014 \n(pending)  bank) \nDec-04  ICBC (Asia)  Chinese Mercantile Bank  100.0  794  1.1 \nJan-05  Temasek  Minsheng Bank  4.6  \u2014  \u2014 \nMar-05  ING (pending)  Bank of Beijing  19.9 1,780    0.91 \nJun-05  Bank of America  China Construction Bank  19.9 26,000  1.4 \n(pending)b \n2005  HSBC  Ping An Insurance  16.0 1,040  \u2014 \n2005  Carlyle Group (pending)  China Pacific Insurance  25.0 3,244  \u2014 \n\u2014 = not available, CNY = yuan, HSBC = Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp., ICBC = Industrial and Commercial Bank \nof China. \na  Goldman Sachs\u2019 research estimates and press reports. \nb  Based on press reports.

 31 \nSUMMARY OF RELEVANT PRC BANKING REGULATIONS1 \n \nA.  Establishment, Licensing and Regulation of Banks in the PRC \n \n1.  The People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s (PRC\u2019s) central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China \n(PBOC), was formerly also the PRC\u2019s banking industry regulator. In April 2003, the State \nCouncil  established  the  China  Banking  Regulatory  Commission  (CBRC,  and  together  with \nPBOC, referred to as the Regulator), to take over most of the banking supervisory functions \nfrom  PBOC.  After  these  reforms,  CBRC  became  the  primary  banking  industry  regulator, \nresponsible for the supervision and administration of all banks in the PRC and their business \nactivities. PBOC retained certain supervisory functions, and became primarily responsible for \nformulating and implementing monetary policy as the PRC\u2019s central bank. \n \n2.  Key laws applicable to banks in the PRC include the Commercial Bank Law, Company \nLaw, PBOC Law, and Law on the Supervision and Administration of Banking Business. In the \ncourse of implementing these laws, the Regulator has issued various regulations, circulars, and \nnotices covering specific issues. \n \n3.  According to the Commercial Bank Law, the establishment of commercial banks and \ntheir branches is subject to examination and approval by the Regulator. The minimum amount \nof registered capital for the establishment of a nation wide commercial bank is CNY1 billion and \nthe registered capital should be paid up in full. When establishing a branch, commercial banks \nshould allocate appropriate amounts of working capital to the branch in the light of the proposed \nscale of operations of the branch. The total working capital allocated to the branches of a \ncommercial bank should not exceed 60% of the total capital of the head office.  \n \nB.  Registered Capital and Shareholder Qualifications \n \n4.  Any change of a commercial bank\u2019s registered capital is subject to the approval of the \nRegulator. Under the Commercial Bank Law, investments in a commercial bank by a domestic \nentity are subject to the approval of the Regulator if the investment amounts to more than a 5% \ninterest in the bank. \n \n5.  Some dated (1994) regulations setting out the qualifications for domestic corporate \nshareholders  in  financial  institutions  are  being  applied  while  new  regulations  are  being \nprepared. The qualification requirements of domestic corporate investors (excluding financial \ninstitutions) under the regulations include the following: \n \n(i)  The  investor  should  be  a  legal  person  registered  with  the  PRC  State \nAdministration for Industry and Commerce or its competent branches. \n(ii)  The investor must repay its bank loans promptly and must be profitable for the \npast 3 years before its investment. \n(iii)  The investor\u2019s net assets should be no less than 30% of its total assets after its \nannual profit distribution. \n(iv)  The investor\u2019s aggregated investment in other enterprises (including financial \ninstitutions) should not be more than 50% of the investor\u2019s net assets.  \n(v)  The investor may not borrow from banks to finance its investment. \n                                            \n1 Source: Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer. \n  ", "32   Appendix 11 \n6.  The  requirements  and  procedures  applicable  to  foreign  equity  participation  in  a \ncommercial bank are set out in the Administrative Measures on Foreign Financial Institutions\u2019 \nInvestment in Domestic Financial Institutions, issued by CBRC in December 2003 (Foreign \nInvestment Measures).   \n \n7.  The  Foreign  Investment  Measures  apply  to  investment  by  foreigners  in  \u201cdomestic \nfinancial  institutions\u201d.  A  distinction  is  drawn  between  \u201cforeign-invested  financial  institutions\u201d \n(which by definition must in aggregate have 25% or more foreign investment) and \u201cdomestic \nfinancial  institutions\u201d  (which  must  by  definition  at  all  times  have  less  than  25%  foreign \ninvestment). Increasing foreign investment beyond this cap would result in the conversion of the \nbank from a \u201cdomestic financial institution\u201d into a \u201cforeign-invested financial institution\u201d, which \nwill be subject to various restrictions set out in PRC laws and regulations on foreign participation \nin the PRC banking sector. The Foreign Investment Measures also provide for a cap of 20% on \neach respective foreign investor. \n \n8.  Under the Foreign Investment Measures, a foreign investor in a PRC bank is required to \nbe a \u201cfinancial institution\u201d, which includes \u201cfinancial holding companies\u201d, banks and other types \nof financial institutions. The foreign investor is required to meet the following qualifications: \n \n(i)  The investor\u2019s total assets at the end of the preceding fiscal year should not be \nless than $10 billion. \n(ii)  During  the  preceding  2  consecutive  years,  the  investor  should  have  been \nprofitable  and  have  maintained  a  good  long-term  credit  rating  from  an \ninternational rating institution acknowledged by CBRC. \n(iii)  Where the investor is a commercial bank, it should have a capital adequacy ratio \nof not less than 8%; and in case of a nonbank financial institution, a ratio of total \ncapital to total risk-weighted assets of at least 10%. \n(iv)  The investor should have sound internal control systems. \n(v)  The  investor  should  be  registered  in  a  jurisdiction  with  a  sound  financial \ninstitutions regulatory system and \u201cgood economic conditions\u201d. \n9.  The target bank must apply to CBRC for approval of the investment by the foreign \nfinancial institution. Key documents to be submitted with the application include (i) shareholders \nand/or board resolutions of the foreign investor and the target bank approving the transaction; \n(ii) a letter of intent signed by the parties; and (iii) the financial statements and other background \ninformation  with  respect  to  the  foreign  investor,  such  as  the  relevant  rating  reports  and \napprovals of the foreign investor\u2019s regulator. \n \n10.  Foreign investors are required to invest in \u201cgood faith\u201d and \u201cfor the long term\u201d, so that \nexit strategies such as put options may not be permitted. \n \n11.  CBRC is required to make a decision on whether or not to approve the application within \nthree months from the date on which it receives the complete set of application documents. This \ntime period may recommence several times if CBRC requires changes or additions to the \ndocument package provided.  \n \n12.  The foreign investor must make its registered capital contribution in full to the target \nbank within 60 business days after receiving CBRC\u2019s approval.  \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20051117164230+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20051117113401+08'00'", "Title": "Proposed Equity Investment in Bank of China Ltd.", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)"}}
