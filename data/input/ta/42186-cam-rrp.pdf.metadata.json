The  proposed  Project  will  finance  the  Government\u2019s  expanded \ncompensatory safety-net programs for the consumption and production of \nfood by the poor and vulnerable in selected rural areas of seven provinces \nin the Tonle Sap Basin, and in selected urban slums of Phnom Penh.  \n \nThe Project will have three components: (i) compensatory consumption \nsupport,  (ii)  productivity  enhancement  support,  and  (iii)  capacity \ndevelopment  for  emergency  response  to  the  food  crisis  and  project \nmanagement.  \n \nThe expected major activities supported by the project will include \n \n(i)    free distribution of rice to the most vulnerable population \ngroups in the Tonle Sap Basin;  \n(ii)   limited food distribution (cash transfer or voucher system) to \nthe poor and vulnerable for food purchase in urban slums of \nPhnom  Penh  (Beungkok,  Stung  Meanchey,  and  the \nRiverside);  \n(iii)   provision of food for the Government\u2019s school feeding and \ntake home ration programs, to benefit students in grades 1\u2013 \n4 and families of selected girl students in grades 4\u20136;   \n(iv)   provision  of  food  to  children  in  selected  early  childhood \nlearning centers (ECLCs);  \n(v)   creation  of  employment  for  the  landless  and  low-income \nhouseholds through a food-for-work program;  \n(vi)   provision  of  appropriate  seed  and  fertilizer  for  small  and \nmarginal  farmers  whose  capacity  to  purchase  inputs  has \nbeen significantly eroded by price increases; \n(vii)   development  of  a  system  for  emergency  food  security \nreserve and rapid response; and \n(viii)  strengthening of the capacity of implementing agencies.    \n  \nRationale  Cambodia has been badly affected by soaring food prices. The domestic \nprice of rice and fertilizer has doubled over past year, while meat and fish \nprices have increased 30%\u201360%. The rice price increase has accentuated \n ", "ii \nthe vulnerability of food deficit households, including the urban poor. In \naddition, input price increases threaten immediate future food production as \nfarmers reduce fertilizer use, thereby reducing paddy yield, which is one of \nthe lowest in Asia even in the best years. Gasoline price increases have \nincreased  the  cost  of  transport,  processing,  and  water  pumping  for \nirrigation. Consequently, poverty and hunger have increased; migration to \nurban areas and movement of people across the borders (Thailand and \nViet Nam) have also increased. School attendance has declined as children \nare reportedly joining the workforce in order to help families, and in some \ncases have stopped coming to classes because of the discontinuation of \nthe  school  feeding  program.  Some  families  are  selling  land  and  other \nassets to buy food and necessities. Home-based crafts are on the decline \nbecause raw material prices have escalated.  \n \nThe rate of inflation has been accelerated by the combined effects of the \nsurge  in  the  price  of  food,  inputs,  and  fuel.  The  situation  has  created \nadditional  demands  on  the  Government\u2019s  limited  revenue  base,  and \nthreatened  the  livelihood  of  millions  of  vulnerable  Cambodians.  The \nGovernment  recognizes  the  need  to  immediately  strengthen  safety-net \nprograms for the most vulnerable population to cope with the drastic rise in \ntheir food bills. It has released 300 tons (t) of rice onto the open market in \norder to bring down rice prices. In addition, the Government has contributed \n4,000 t of rice to the World Food Programme feeding program, including \nschool feeding. It is under these dire circumstances that the Government \nhas requested emergency assistance from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to augment its ongoing efforts and help offset some of the short-term \nhuman costs of this exogenous shock.  \n \nThe proposed Project is an integral part of the overall commitment made by \nADB in May 2008 at its Annual General Meeting in Madrid, Spain to provide \nassistance to countries hit hard by food price rises. Those most vulnerable \nto  food  price  shocks  need  to  be  protected  from  nutritional  deprivation, \nerosion of their real purchasing power, and asset alienation. It is proposed \nthat  the  project  financing  should  be  covered  by  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and \nEmergency Assistance Policy to support urgent mitigation measures by the \nGovernment in order to tackle the food price crisis.  \n \nImpact and  The expected impact is reduced vulnerability of food-insecure households \nOutcome  in Cambodia. The expected outcome is improved access to sufficient food \nand production inputs by food-poor Cambodians in the target provinces. \nThe Project will improve the food security of an estimated 500,000 poor and \nvulnerable people affected by higher food prices. Food intake by the poor \nwill increase, while the lowest quintile of farmers (the poorest 20% of the \nnational population) will be able to increase food production. Employment \nand income of households with limited purchasing power will increase. The \nProject will reduce poverty of low-income groups, and will strengthen the \ncapacity  of  the  Government  institutions  involved  in  emergency  food \nassistance. The focus of the Project will be on improving access of the poor \nto food, income, and livelihood support. The Project will assist in relieving \nfiscal pressures caused by a sharp rise in safety-net program expenditure.  \n   \nProject  The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $40.08 million, including \nInvestment Plan   taxes and duties of $3.54 million. \n ", " \n   \nFinancing Plan  It is proposed that ADB provide  a loan of $17.50 million equivalent in \nspecial drawing rights and a grant not exceeding the equivalent of $17.50 \nmillion, both from its Special Fund resources, in order to finance 87.32% of \nthe total Project cost. The Government will provide $5.08 million (12.68% of \nthe total Project cost) to finance taxes and duties of $3.54 million and \nrecurrent costs of $1.54 million. The loan portion will carry an interest rate \nof 1% per year, a maturity of 40 years and a grace period of 10 years, with \nrepayment of principle at 2% per year for the first 10 years after the grace \nperiod, and 4% per year thereafter. Interest charges on the loan are to be \ncapitalized. \n($ million) \nSource  Total  Percent \n Asian Development Bank ADF Grant  17.50  43.66 \n Asian Development Bank ADF Loan  17.50  43.66 \n Government of Cambodia  5.08  12.68 \nTotal  40.08  100.00 \n \nCambodia is eligible for an Asian Development Fund grant. Its fiscal and \nforeign exchange resources plus its donor funds are inadequate to meet \nthe required wide-ranging emergency support arising from soaring food, \ninput, and energy prices. Cambodia\u2019s debt sustainability analysis suggests \nthe necessity to channel a significant portion of development assistance \ninto grants for years to come. \n   \nPeriod of  1 October 2008 to 30 September 2011 \nUtilization \n  \nEstimated Project  31 March 2011 \nCompletion Date \n     \nExecuting  Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) \nAgency \n   \nImplementation  The  project  will  utilize  existing  effective  delivery  mechanisms  and \nArrangements  institutions, and enhance their capacity, as appropriate. MEF will be the \nexecuting agency of the Project. The proposed implementing agencies  will \nbe (i) Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) for the seed \nand fertilizer assistance; (ii) Ministry of Rural Development (MRD) for the \nfood-for-work program; (iii) Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology \n(MOWRAM) for the food-for-work program; (iv) the Ministry of Commerce \n(MOC) for the emergency food security system; (v) National Committee for \nDisaster  Management  (NCDM)  and  provincial  committee  for  disaster \nmanagement  (PCDM)  for  overall  coordination,  management,  and \ndistribution  of  food  and  input  assistance,  and  establishment  of  the \nemergency food security reserve and rapid response system; (vi) Ministry \nof Education, Youth and Sports (MOEYS) for the school feeding program; \n(vii) Ministry of Women Affairs (MOWA) for the ECLC feeding program; and \n(vii)  commune  councils  and  village  development  committees  for \nidentification of target groups and distribution of food and inputs. \n \nThe  National  Food  Security  Task  Force,  headed  by  MEF,  with \n ", "iv \nrepresentation from concerned Government ministries and agencies and \nkey development partners, will provide overall policy guidance to Project \nimplementation.  A  central  project  management  unit,  led  by  a  Project \ndirector,  will  be  established  at  MEF  to  oversee  daily  implementation. \nProvincial project management units (PPMUs) will be established at the \nPCDM in all seven Project provinces. Interdepartmental coordination will be \nassured  by  NCDM  at  the  central level,  and  by  PCDM  (chaired  by  the \nprovincial governor) at the provincial level. \n \nProject funds will flow from ADB to MEF, which will establish a project \nimprest account at the Cambodian National Bank. Funds will flow to various \nimplementing agencies to finance activities they are individually responsible \nfor. Each PPMU will establish a second-generation imprest account at the \nCambodian National Bank. ADB will audit the use of the loan proceeds in \naccordance with its fiduciary responsibilities and verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s certification.  \n \nProcurement  The Project will entail procurement of rice, seeds, fertilizers, vehicles, office \nequipment, and a large number of community-based civil works under the \nfood-for-work program. All procurement to be financed under the Project \nwill  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Retroactive financing for a maximum \nof 30% of the total loan, grant, and technical assistance (TA) amounts will \nbe considered for eligible expenditure if incurred not earlier than 22 August \n2008 and provided that the expenditure is in compliance with the following \nconditions: (i) it is in accordance with acceptable procedures specified by \nADB,  (ii)  it  is  verified  by  ADB,  (iii)  it  is  certified  by  MEF,  and  (iv)  the \ncertification  is  acceptable  to  ADB.  ADB  will  audit  the  use  of  the  loan \nproceeds in accordance with its requirements on fiduciary management \nand control, and verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. The \nGovernment  has  been  advised  by  ADB  that  provision  of  retroactive \nfinancing does not commit ADB to finance any part of the Project. The \nborrower will review the relevant agency\u2019s capacity to ensure compliance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. Flexible procedures pursuant to the \nprovisions under ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines will be adopted. \n   \nProject Benefits  The proposed Project will enhance Cambodia\u2019s capacity to respond to food \nand Beneficiaries  emergencies  and  cope  with  the  global  food  price  increase.  The \nGovernment will be able to expand its modest safety-net programs, which \ncould not be put in place due to severe budget constraints. The nutritional \nstatus of the Cambodian people will improve. This is particularly crucial for \nthe  people  who  are  chronically  vulnerable  and  are  therefore  at  risk  of \nundernutrition and malnutrition. Groups that are likely to benefit most from \nthe Project are landless households, daily casual laborers, female-headed \nhouseholds,  the  handicapped  (physical  and  chronic  illnesses  like \ntuberculosis and AIDS), the lowest quintile of farmers (the poorest 20% of \nthe national population), family fishers, ethnic minority groups, vulnerable \nschool children, pregnant and lactating mothers, fixed-salary workers, and \nurban slum dwellers. Rice production will increase; increased production \nwill come from area expansion and yield increase due to improved rice \nseeds,  fertilizer,  and  irrigation  facilities.  The  food-for-work  program  will \ngenerate  the  much-needed  employment  for  vulnerable  households  and \ncreate community assets. Improved market links will aid marketing and \n ", " \nincrease family cash incomes. The food price crisis has highlighted the \npoint that the natural resources of Cambodia\u2014land, water, forests, and \nfisheries\u2014must be conserved and used in a sustainable way in order to \nenhance food security for all Cambodians and to improve the quality of life. \nGovernment, nongovernment, and civil society organizations will become \nbetter equipped to deal with any food crisis in the future, especially in terms \nof  reducing  human  suffering.  Budget  management  will  be  improved  in \nterms of prioritization and activity expansion in a sustainable way. \n \nCapacity of the people at the grassroots level to help themselves will be \nenhanced. There will be greater synergy between various development \ninterventions. This, together with the coordinated donor response to the \nfood price crisis, will have greater multiplier effects. Collaboration among \ngovernment  and  nongovernment  organizations  will  increase,  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s  deconcentration  and  decentralization  policy  may  receive \nadded  impetus.  Positive  macroeconomic  impact  will  flow  from  reduced \ninflationary pressures, which threaten Cambodia\u2019s growth prospects. About \n500,000 residents, or 89,000 households, living in and around the Tonle \nSap Basin will benefit from the proposed project assistance. The use of \nquality seed and fertilizer, combined with extension advice on their optimal \nuse, will open the door for longer-term productivity growth and enhanced \nfood supply. \n   \nRisks and  The Government\u2019s social safety-net programs for protecting the poor and \nMitigations  vulnerable groups are underdeveloped, and relevant institutions are weak \nin their capacity to run the social safety-net programs. The concept of a \nfood  security  reserve  system  is  relatively  new  to  the  country,  and \nconcerned institutions lack operational skills and management experience. \nThe Project design provides for addressing these institutional weaknesses \nthrough one of the Project outputs (component 3, Capacity Development \nfor Food Crisis and Project Management). The component scope provides \nfor  (i)  establishment  of  an  independent  monitoring  system,  (ii) \nestablishment of a system of emergency food reserve and rapid response, \nand  (iii)  strengthening  of  the  capacity  of  the  executing  agency  and \nimplementing agencies. \n \nThe  governance  of  the  program  will  have  built-in  transparency  and \naccountability, with output monitoring and independent evaluation of effects \nand  impact.  The  Project  and  attached  TA  include  definitive  fiduciary \noversight of the funds provided and disbursed.  \n \nImmediate procurement program may at risk if there is a shortage of grain, \nseed, and fertilizer for purchase domestically, in which case prices are \nlikely to rise. This risk can be mitigated by staggering the purchase of \ngrains  and  extensive  canvassing  among  potential  suppliers  to  ensure \nadequate supply at reasonable price both within the Project provinces and \nother surplus localities. Given that seed supply sources in the country are \nlimited, AQIP Seed Company has been identified as the main supplier of \nseed, and provision has been made for direct procurement of seed from \nseed producers associations, if needed, for distribution to target farmers. \nSince the divestment of the national agricultural inputs supply company, the \nprivate sector has successfully evolved as the importer and supplier of \nfertilizer to local markets across the country.  \n ", "vi \n  Linking  of  short-term  safety-net  programs  with  long-term  productivity \nimprovement measures will be a challenge, as it will require speedy design \nand implementation of investment projects by a multitude of Government \nagencies  whose  capacity  is  limited.  The  Government  recognizes  the \nchallenge and has initiated actions to accelerate implementation of ongoing \nprojects aimed at production improvement and livelihood development. The \nGovernment has also attached priority to the pipeline projects of its bilateral \nand multilateral development partners that will target rural development and \npoverty reduction.  \n \nThe success of the Project relies on effective community mobilization in the \nproper identification and selection of target groups. The Project will mobilize \nlocal  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  to  supervise  and  monitor \ntarget-group  selection,  and  distribute  food  and  inputs.  A  grievance \nmechanism  will  be  set  up  by  the  executing  agency  to  address  public \ngrievance with regard to procurement and distribution irregularities.  \n \nDue to the large volume of emergency food to be distributed, there are \npotential risks in the areas of storage and distribution. Enhancement of \npublic sector food storage capacity is now a priority for the Government, \nand it has taken steps to establish emergency food warehouses in strategic \nlocations.  The  Government  is  currently  working  with  the  rice  millers \nassociation and Green Trade to use their storage facilities. The Project \nprocurement  system  will  include  delivery  to  the  commune  distribution \npoints. Commune council buildings and facilities will be used for temporary \nstorage prior to distribution to villages. \n \n   \nTechnical  An  attached  TA  project  of  $1.6  million  will  accompany  the  Project  to \nAssistance  strengthen the Government\u2019s capacity to deal with food crisis and related \nemergencies  with  the  involvement  of  MAFF,  MRD,  MOWRAM,  MOC, \nNCDM, PCDM, and commune councils. ADB will finance the TA of $1.5 \nmillion on a grant basis from its TA funding program, and the Government \nwill contribute $100,000. The TA fund, together with the allocated fund \nunder component 3, will help to (i) establish an independent monitoring \nsystem to oversee target-group selection, distribution of food and inputs, \norganization  and  management  of  the  food-for-work  program,  and \ncompliance with fiduciary requirements; (ii) develop a system of emergency \nfood reserve and rapid response; (iii) strengthen the Government\u2019s longer-\nterm capability to deal with food emergencies; and (iv) manage and monitor \nProject implementation.  \n \n \n ", " \nMAP \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan, \nand (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Emergency Food Assistance \nProject.  The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Strengthening \nInstitutional Capacity for Emergency Response to Food Crisis and Improving Food Security, and if \nthe Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, \nwill approve the TA. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis   \n2.  The Global Food Price Crisis. The surge in food prices since early 2008 has caused the \nworld food situation to take a dramatic turn, impacting the poor and vulnerable people who spend a \nsubstantial  part  of  their  income  on  food.  Many  countries  are  facing  the  challenge  of  sharp \nincreases in food and fuel prices threatening macroeconomic stability and overall growth. Poor \nhouseholds in the cities, smallholders, landless and marginal farmers who are net food buyers, and \nnonfood producers in rural areas who spend a large share of their incomes on food, are the most \nadversely affected.  \n \n3.  Falling stocks of food grains (such as rice and wheat), growing imbalance in supply and \ndemand  due  to  rising  demand  for  food,  and  unilateral  trade  policy  measures  undertaken  by \ncountries to ensure domestic food availability, have exacerbated price instability on world markets \nand threatened global food security. From mid-2007 to early 2008, international food prices soared \ndrastically. The price of rice almost doubled (98%), wheat rose by 130%, and maize by 38%; meat \nprices have increased by about 40% during this period. The situation has been compounded by the \ndoubling or more than doubling of fertilizer prices in 2007, followed by the almost doubling of oil \nprices. While the price pressure has eased a bit in the international market, the general consensus \nis that the high price regime of inputs and outputs is here to stay, pushing up the inflation rate with \nconsequent negative implications for economic growth.  \n \n4.  In the current situation of high food prices, providing emergency assistance and supporting \nagricultural productivity enhancement and income earning by food-insecure people are the main \nmeans  to  reduce  hunger  and  ensure  an  improved  world  food  situation.  Protecting  the  most \nvulnerable people in rural and urban areas will require targeted direct food distribution, food \nsubsidies, cash transfers, and nutrition programs, including school feeding. Strengthening social \nprotection is especially important for vulnerable groups, including children, pregnant women, the \nHIV infected, and the elderly. As a short-term response, support for boosting local food production \nis urgently needed. These measures should include the distribution to small-scale farmers of seed, \nfertilizer,  animal  feed,  and  other  inputs  through  vouchers  or  other  forms  of  subsidies.  If \nimplemented effectively, such programs are expected to (i) increase supply in poor countries and, \nthus, improve food availability; and (ii) increase the income of small producers. They may also \nreduce price increases in local markets.  \n \n5.  The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), World Bank, ADB, International Fund for \nAgricultural  Development  (IFAD),  and  many  others  have  called  for  urgent  and  immediate \nassistance for social safety-net and production enhancement programs. FAO has called for $1.7 \nbillion to provide low-income food-deficit countries with rice seeds, fertilizers, and other inputs to \nboost  production.  ADB  has  pledged  to  provide  $0.5  billion  in  immediate  support  to  member \ncountries on a priority basis in 2008, and an additional $1 billion in 2009 to support medium- to \nlong-term investment in agricultural and rural development. \n ", "2  \n \n \n6.  Cambodian Gross Domestic Product Growth. Cambodia has experienced continued and \nsignificant economic growth in recent years, but growth of the agriculture and natural resources \n(ANR) sector has lagged and it has been fluctuating widely depending on variations in weather \npatterns  and  occurrence  of  natural  calamities.  The  importance  of  the  ANR  sector  in  the \ndevelopment process for poverty reduction and food security, and the need for a holistic approach \nto rural development, is reinforced by the food price crisis. Total gross domestic product (GDP) \ngrew steadily at an average annual rate of nearly 10%, ranging between 6.6% and 13.3%, during \n2001\u20132007; the corresponding rate for agriculture was 5.8%, fluctuating between \u20132.5% and 15%. \nFluctuations in agricultural growth performance, coming mainly from the crops sector (especially \npaddy) will have implications for household food security, and can exacerbate the poverty situation \nfurther in the absence of alternative employment opportunities. The modest single-digit inflation \nrate of the early 2000s has more than trebled to a record rate of 18.7% in January 2008, according \nto unofficial estimates of the National Institute for Statistics; the inflation rate has now exceeded \n25%, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Higher international oil and food prices, \nhigher prices of imported goods due to the depreciation of the riel and dollar, and very high growth \nin commercial bank lending are the main sources of inflation in Cambodia. The annual food price \ninflation of 24%, combined with slowing garment exports due to weaker external demand and \nheightened regional competition, led the IMF to reduce GDP growth projections for 2008 from 9.5% \nto 7%.1 The Government has undertaken a number of measures, including credit control by raising \nreserve requirements, to curb inflation. \n \n7.  The Food Price Crisis and Implications for Cambodia. As a result of the unprecedented \nincrease  in  food  and  fuel  prices,  Cambodian-marketed  paddy  has  quickly  found  its  way  to \nneighboring countries lured by relatively high prices. Cambodian farmers, many of whom sell \npaddy right after harvest under compulsion to pay back loans taken from moneylenders and \ntraders, have benefited little from the rise in international prices. On the contrary, these farmers, \nalong with other food deficit families, had to buy rice on the domestic market at a much higher \nprice. Across the country, 85% of the population live in rural areas, 40% of the households are \nlandless or land poor, and nearly 60% of total household expenditure is for food. Over one third of \nthe rural population lives under the poverty line. The consequences of rising prices of food and \nagricultural production inputs have been severe for poorer households and smallholder farmers. \nThe situation has triggered the sale of household assets, increased the taking out of high-interest \nloans (exacerbating the debt trap), decreased school attendance, and increased child labor, and \nresulted in internal migration pressure. \n \n8.  Household food stocks are declining. The lack of exchange entitlement2 is a major source \nof concern for the vulnerable population in rural and urban areas. The Tonle Sap Basin provinces \nhave been adversely hit by the crisis, since most people of this region either have small agricultural \nholdings (less than 1 hectare [ha]) or very limited sources of cash income. Rice is the main staple \nfood item in Cambodia and constitutes 50% of the total food consumption of poor families. The \nhigh price of rice will impact poverty reduction efforts, and it was predicted that a 10% increase in \nthe rice price would increase the national poverty rate by 0.5%3 (in both rural and urban areas). \nThe increase in rice prices has pushed up the food poverty line, resulting in a substantial addition \nto  the  population  below  the  food  poverty  line.  Persistence  of  this  situation  could  lead  to \nmacroeconomic turmoil if it is not properly handled through effective urgent measures, and will \n                                                 \n1  IMF. 2008.

The Longer-Term Burden of Poverty and Hunger. Cambodia mirrors the global image of \nunderinvestment in agriculture. Degradation of the natural resource base, misallocation in the use \nof land, declining household food stocks, and lack of exchange entitlement of the poor, combined \nwith a host of cyclical and long-term factors, have affected the supply and demand and prices, and \npushed millions of people into the food poverty trap. Paddy rice production increased from 3.5 \nmillion t in 1996 to about 6.73 million t in 2007. The milled rice surplus was estimated at 1.64 \nmillion t in 2007 (Appendix 2). Much of the marketed surplus finds its way across the border to Viet \nNam and Thailand unprocessed. However, this surplus does not mean absence of hunger among \nvulnerable groups during the wet season (July\u2013November), when household food reserves and \nmarket supply are at their lowest, and income sources in rural areas are limited.  \n \n10.  The Government\u2019s efforts to maintain steady macroeconomic growth and stability are being \nhampered by the need to support the poor and vulnerable groups through feeding programs and \nincome support programs. Due to the high cost of food and budgetary stress, Cambodia\u2019s children \nfeeding  program  has  been  substantially  scaled  down,  and  this  is  already  affecting  school \nattendance  and  child  health.  The  World  Food  Programme  (WFP)  has  asked  for  help,  as  its \nresources are inadequate to continue with the feeding program for schoolchildren given the rising \nprice of food, and the necessity to expand its safety-net programs in the country. About 2.6 million \nCambodians were food-poor in 2004 on the basis of the food poverty line of $0.50 per capita per \nday, according to WFP. The increase in rice prices has pushed up the food poverty line and \npushed down the exchange entitlement, resulting in a substantial addition to the population below \nthe food poverty line. Rural poverty in Cambodia is embedded in slow and variable growth of \nagriculture  and  the  low  level  of  rural  sector  development,  causing  persistent  low  incomes, \nincreasing inequality of income, food insecurity, asset alienation, and marginalization. \n \n11.  In Cambodia, population groups at risk from the sharp increase in food prices are landless \nhouseholds,  daily  casual  laborers,  female-headed  households,  the  handicapped  (those  with \nphysical and chronic illnesses such as tuberculosis and AIDS), the lowest quintile of farmers (the \npoorest 20% of the national population), fisher families, ethnic minority groups, vulnerable school \nchildren, pregnant and lactating mothers, fixed-salary workers, and migrant families. These groups \ninclude (i) the chronically vulnerable, who lack adequate access to food throughout the year; (ii) the \nseasonally vulnerable, who lack access to food during the lean season (August\u2013November) when \nhousehold reserves and market supply of rice are at their lowest; and (iii) others who may be \nperiodically  vulnerable  due  to  sudden  increases  in  food  prices,  such  as  the  one  currently \nexperienced. The sudden spike in food prices has significantly deepened suffering of groups (i) \nand (ii), and has added group (iii) to the pool of the food insecure, creating an unprecedented \nemergency. Cambodia lacks the means to deal with the underlying cyclical and structural factors \ncausing the food emergency. \n \n12.  Institutional  Inadequacies  to  Deal  with  Food  Insecurity  and  Emergency.  The \nGovernment\u2019s long-term strategy for food security, which is to provide local grain storage and \nreduce post-harvest losses at the farm gate, is yet to be realized. Limited private and public \nstorage  and  processing  capacity  is  a  major  constraint  in  dealing  with  seasonal  production \nfluctuations. Consequently, parts of the country still experience food deficits due to production \nshortfalls as well as distribution and infrastructure constraints. In the absence of an effective and \nfunctioning emergency procurement system or strategic reserve to deal with the food crisis, WFP \nand other donors have worked with the National Committee for Disaster Management (NCDM) to \ndevelop  modest  capacity  for  procurement,  transport,  storage,  and  distribution  of  food  at  the \n ", "4  \n \nnational, provincial, district, and local levels. However, due to resource constraints, progress in this \nregard has been modest. The food price crisis has strained WFP resources and reduced its \ncoverage.  The  impact  of  any  cutback  of  WFP's  budget,  and  the  absence  of  substantial \nGovernment and other development partner food assistance programs, will be more severe in the \nTonle Sap Basin where there is a high concentration of food-insecure people,   \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Food Price Shocks \n  \n13.  High food prices have hit the poor and food-insecure households the hardest. In some of \nthe provinces, more than half of the rural households suffer from food deficit during any given year, \nand this percentage has increased. Field data suggests that the proportion of hungry households is \nat an all-time high of one third or more. Higher food prices have led families to reduce their \nconsumption, and there is real danger of widespread undernutrition as the country moves into the \nlean production season over the August\u2013November period. Food assistance must reach food-\ndeprived families at the earliest possible time. In order to fill the rice gap, families' diets may also \nbecome  less  diversified  (meat  and  fish  consumption  has  declined),  raising  the  specter  of \nmalnutrition, which is a problem in Cambodia among children, women, and the poor, even at the \nbest of times. As an importer of beef, chicken, pork, and cooking oil, Cambodia has suffered from \nsoaring food prices. As a dollarized economy, Cambodia also received a shock from the recent \ndollar depreciation, which made non-dollar-denominated imports more costly.  \n \n14.  Domestic prices of rice have doubled over the past year, as has the price of fertilizer. In \nsome provinces fertilizer prices have trebled; seed prices have gone up by an average of 50% or \nmore, and meat and fish prices have increased by 30%\u201360%. Notwithstanding the Government \nsubsidy, gasoline prices have nearly doubled. The increase in the price of rice has accentuated the \nvulnerability of food food deficit households, including the urban poor. At the same time, the \nstability in the food supply at the farm household level in the coming season(s) is being hampered \nby the high prices of inputs. Input price increases threaten immediate food production, as farmers \ncan no longer afford to buy the required quantities of fertilizers. Reduced fertilizer use is likely to \nreduce paddy yield, particularly for the poor and marginal farmers. Fuel price increases have, at \nthe same time, increased the cost of transport, processing, and water pumping for irrigation. The \nreduced  paddy  yield  will  reduce  both  household  and  market  supplies  of  rice,  increase  price \nvolatility, and affect the rural economy of Cambodia, which already suffers from many structural \nfactors hindering the growth of the agriculture sector. \n \n15.  Vulnerability of the food-poor Cambodians arises not only from export of rice immediately \nafter the harvesting season and the existence of pockets of hunger, but also from the lack of \nprocessing and storage capacity in the country. The Government does not have an emergency \nprocurement system or a strategic reserve large enough to deal with a potential food crisis. Rice \ntraders and millers lack capital and banks do not extend adequate finance to them to build private \nstorage and processing capacity. Vietnamese and Thai traders can come in and purchase paddy in \nbulk. Hence the paradox of food deficit in a country that potentially has surplus. The situation is \nmost acute at the household level, where a combination of debt burden and inadequate storage \ncapacity forces families (food surplus or deficit) to sell much of the grain immediately after harvest. \nThey  buy  back  food  later  in  the  season  at  a  much  higher  price  and  thus  remain  extremely \nvulnerable to any sharp rise in food prices. Chronic and seasonally food-insecure families become \neven more insecure and suffer nutritional deprivation, while food surplus or potentially food surplus \nfamilies become food insecure. Their plight is further aggravated by the tendency of local traders to \nhoard paddy and/or rice through the harvest season and well into the lean season in order to gain \nmaximum price.  \n ", "    5\n   \n \n2.  Poverty and Macroeconomic Impacts  \n \n16.  Poverty Impact. As in other Asian countries, high food prices are undermining gains in \npoverty reduction efforts in Cambodia. The percentage of the population below the poverty line \ndeclined between the mid-1990s and 2004, but the trend seems to have been reversed in recent \nmonths due to the slow growth of the agriculture sector and food and input price rises. Food and \nenergy accounts for a disproportionately large share of total household expenditure\u2014up to 80% \nand above in rural Cambodia. More than 6 million poor people are vulnerable to food and energy \nprice increases. The extent of price increase over the last one year suggests that an additional 2 \nmillion  people  may  have  slipped  below  the  poverty  line,  while  the  existing  poor  have  been \nexperiencing deeper poverty. This is in line with findings from simulation models of the Philippines \nand Pakistan, and is similar to the experience of Bangladesh. In consultation with the provincial \nauthorities and commune council leaders, ADB has assessed the poverty rate in the rural areas of \nseven  selected  provinces  at  38%,  which  is  higher  that  than  the  estimated  35%  in  the  2004 \nsocioeconomic  survey.  In  Cambodia,  due  to  the  increase  in  rice  prices,  many  families  have \nreduced their usual three daily rice-based meals to two or less, with each consisting of less and \nless food. It has been reported that children have stopped going to school in order to work \nelsewhere and bring home additional income for the household. Disease incidence has increased \nas family expenditure on health has declined. The pressure from food price increases obviously \nundermines poverty reduction efforts. It is reported that remittances by garment workers to their \nfamilies in rural areas have declined drastically due to the rising cost of living.     \n  \n17.  Macroeconomic Impact. Food demand has increased over the past few years as a result \nof higher economic growth, the increase (18% in 2007) in tourist numbers to 2 million/year, and \nhigher income among urban and suburban households. Inflation accelerated in 2008, mainly as a \nresult of increases in food prices. At the end of 2007, inflation stood at 10.8% on a year-on-year \nbasis;  in  the  following  months,  the  inflation  rate  went  much  higher.  Rice  prices  rose  due  to \ndomestic supply shortages, and prices of other food items also rose, reflecting rising consumption, \nincluding imported food items (mostly from Thailand). The price of meat (pork and chicken) also \nincreased, in part following a ban on meat imports from Viet Nam to prevent the spread of animal \ndiseases. Higher global fuel prices added to inflationary pressures, as did the weakening of the \ndollar, which is widely used in Cambodia (its depreciation against the Thai baht contributed to \nimported inflation). High oil prices have driven up the cost of transportation and energy, which are \nlargely oil-dependent. This has added to production costs, which are already high in the present \nsituation of poor rural road infrastructure and expensive electricity. The Government had to allocate \n$14 million from the current budget for purchase of grain at a time when much of the road and \nirrigation  infrastructure  is  deteriorating  due  to  poor  maintenance  which  itself  is  caused  by \ninadequate budget allocation. This fund represents a subsidy to traders who would have otherwise \nbought paddy or built warehouses up to that amount had they not diverted their own resources to \nspeculative land purchases. Land grabbing and speculation, combined with frequent turnover of \nownership, have caused land prices to increase phenomenally, contributing to inflation. On the \nother hand, the sale of farm land is affecting production, and dispossessed landowners are now \njoining the ranks of net food buyers, putting additional pressure on prices. Green Trade, a state-\nowned company which has had to sell grain at less than market price, has been incurring losses \nand  putting  an  additional  strain  on  the  Government  budget.  Higher  food  prices  have  slowed \neconomic activity in Cambodia as savings and investments are reduced.  \n \n3.  Immediate Response to Food Price Shocks  \n \n18.  The Government Responses. The food price crisis has created an urgent need for the \nGovernment  to  support  and  strengthen  social  safety-net  programs,  and  this  has  strained  its \n ", "6  \n \nresources. Despite the absence of established social safety-net programs and institutionalized \nresponse mechanisms, the Government has adopted a number of short-term measures to ease \nthe crisis. The National Task Force for Emergency Food Assistance has recently been established \nto provide strategic direction and policy guidance in coordination with development partners to \ninterventions aimed to support the vulnerable population. The Ministry of Economy and Finance \n(MEF),  Ministry  of  Commerce  (MOC),  NCDM,  and  a  number  of  Government  agencies  have \ncoordinated their efforts to undertake the following direct and indirect measures: \n \n(i)  Rice export was temporarily banned from all provinces. However, this initial ban was \ncompletely  lifted  in  stages,  first  from  the  three  provinces  bordering  Viet  Nam, \nfollowed by the northern provinces bordering Thailand. \n(ii)  At the instruction of the Government, Green Trade released approximately 300 t of \nrice to the market at lower than market price (KR1,800/kilogram [kg] compared with \nthe prevailing market price of around KR2,500/kg). The rice millers association also \ncontributed to this effort. The Government's administrative actions, such as the \nexport ban and release of stock by Green Trade during the height of the food price \ncrisis, had some dampening impact on the market but not enough to fully insulate \nthe poor from food price shocks. \n(iii)  The Government provided WFP with 4,000 t of rice to support (a) the school feeding \nprogram and take home ration or food scholarships, and (b) people with AIDS or \ntuberculosis. \n(iv)  Duties on food imports were reduced to zero.  \n(v)  The Government removed the ban on pork imports. \n(vi)  Some business taxes were suspended so that concerned companies could increase \nthe salaries of employees. \n(vii)  In  order  to  stem  the  flow  of  paddy  to  neighboring  countries,  the  Government \nprovided a $10 million cash flow facility to the Rural Development Bank to extend \nshort-term loans to the private sector for purchase of paddy.  \n(viii)  Green Trade received a cash flow facility of $4 million from the Government to \npurchase rice. \n(ix)  In moderating inflation caused by rising food prices, the Government continued to \nimplement tight control on fiscal policy and stabilize the exchange rate. There is also \na growing role for monetary policy in controlling the rapid growth in money supply \n(63% in 2007).4 \n(x)  The Government has continued past policies geared towards expanding food and \nother agricultural production. These include improving the availability of high-yield \nseed  supply,  strengthening  disease  and  pest  control,  providing  more  irrigation \nfacilities for dry paddy lands, and increasing the popularity of the system of rice \nintensification, which contributed to improving land productivity. \n(xi)  The Government\u2019s spending on agriculture has trebled since 2001, which excludes \ncapital spending for construction of rural roads and irrigation facilities. \n \n19.   In addition, the Government approached its development partners for support in tackling the \nproblem  of  soaring  food  prices.  ADB  received  a  request  from  the  Government  to  provide \nassistance of $30 million to finance its emergency measures against the negative effects of soaring \nfood and agricultural inputs prices on the poor and vulnerable groups in Cambodia. A similar \nrequest was sent by the Government to the World Bank. WFP, FAO, and other donors have \nworked with the Government to develop a modest capacity for procurement, transport, storage, \nand distribution of food at the national, provincial, district, and local levels. However, due to \nresource constraints, the progress with the program development and its coverage has been \n                                                 \n4  IMF. 2007. Monetary Survey, 2007. Cambodia. \n ", "    7\n   \nmodest. WFP has identified food-insecure people and their locations throughout the country. It has \ntargeted to provide assistance to 1.5 million of the 2.6 million food-insecure people under its \nProtracted Relief and Recovery Operation5 through food-for-work and school feeding programs, \nsupport to tuberculosis and HIV victims, vocational training, and mother and child health activities. \nHowever, funding shortages may halve that target.  \n  \n20.  ADB  and  Development  Partner  Response.  Following  the  Government\u2019s  request  for \nassistance to deal with the food price crisis, ADB, World Bank, United Nations Development \nProgramme  (UNDP),  IFAD,  FAO,  WFP,  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development \n(USAID), and a number of development partners have coordinated their efforts to assess the \ncountry\u2019s immediate needs for supporting the food-insecure population. The ADB Reconnaissance \nMission which visited Cambodia from 26 May to 6 June 2008 joined the development partners and \nconducted a preliminary needs assessment for the emergency food assistance project. The ADB \nmission conducted joint and separate field visits to provinces around the Tonle Sap Basin, where \nthe food poverty rate is one of the highest. According to WFP, 40% of the food-insecure people live \nin the Tonle Sap Basin, which is home to 30% of the national population. A severe erosion of the \npurchasing power measured by change in terms of trade of milled rice against daily wages was \nobserved in the Tonle Sap Basin (23.08%) as compared to the national average (15.04%). At the \ninvitation of the Government, an ADB fact-finding mission visited Cambodia from 23 June to 4 July \n2008. The mission had meetings with relevant stakeholders and representatives of donor partners, \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), and the private sector.  \n \n21.  The mission agreed with the Government and the development partners that the target of \nADB assistance will be mainly the Tonle Sap Basin, which has been the main priority for medium- \nto long-term ADB intervention under the Tonle Sap Initiative, considering the high incidence of \npoverty and greater vulnerability of the basin ecosystem.6 A summary matrix of external assistance \nto food security is outlined in Appendix 3. The mission visited seven provinces in the Tonle Sap \nBasin\u2014Banteay  Meanchey,  Battambang,  Kampong  Chhnang,  Kampong  Thom,  Pursat,    Odor \nMeanchey and Siem Reap, \u2014 to discuss with local stakeholders (i) the impacts of soaring prices of \nfood and crop inputs, (ii) delivery mechanisms of ADB\u2019s assistance to ease negative impacts in the \nshort term, and (iii) integration of appropriate measures in the Government\u2019s existing strategies to \naddress medium- and long-term food security issues. In addition, the mission visited those extremely \nvulnerable slum communities (Beungkok, Stung Meanchay, and Riverside) in Phnom Penh where \nthe Government plans to extend its social safety-net program. \n \n4.  Needs Assessment  \n \n22.  The needs assessment was conducted in cooperation with key development partners, \nparticularly WFP, to examine the impacts of soaring prices on Cambodia as a whole and on the \npoor section of the economy in order to provide a basis for prioritizing external assistance.

Estimates show that production in 2008\u20132010 might \ndecline as a consequence of higher prices of inputs such as rice seeds and fertilizer, \nputting further pressure on domestic food price inflation. The higher the input prices, \nthe less quality inputs smallholders will use, resulting in lower per-hectare yield. A \nconservative estimate indicated that the national surplus will fall to 754,000 t in 2010 \nif the price trend continues upwards. This level will drop further in the event of a \nminor price shock. \n(ii)  Rising  food  prices  have  seen  the  purchasing  power  of  households  nationwide \ndecline significantly. This is most evident in the poor section of the economy, where \npeople lack resources to generate additional income to compensate for the loss due \nto high prices. It is estimated that, other things being equal, the Cambodian poor \nneed $387 million in the current year to equalize their rice purchasing power of \n2007.  \n(iii)  Aside from the loss in rice purchasing power, the rising prices of inputs such as rice \nseeds and fertilizers have significantly increased the financial burden of the low-\nincome and poor farming communities, and is estimated at $119 million.  \n(iv)  Together, the two shocks of soaring food and input prices have increased the \nburdens of the poor households nationwide by $506.5 million. \n(v)  The equivalent estimate for households in and around the Tonle Sap Basin alone is \n$209.9 million, or 41.4% of the nationwide purchasing power loss. The food, seed, \nand fertilizer purchasing power for the lowest 20% quintile of the population is \nestimated at $86 million. With around 30% of the national population, this suggests \nthat the Tonle Sap Basin is suffering more seriously than the rest of the country and \nneeds  emergency  responses  from  the  Government  and  development  partners. \nDetailed estimates are outlined in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \n5.  Government Strategy \n \n23.  In 2004, the prime minister of Cambodia presented the Rectangular Strategy for Growth, \nEmployment, Equity and Efficiency at the Third Legislature of the National Assembly. The strategy \nstressed the need \u201cto improve agricultural productivity and diversification, thereby enabling the \nagriculture  sector  to  serve  as  the  dynamic  driving  force  for  economic  growth  and  poverty \nreduction\u201d. This priority has now taken on greater importance in light of the current global situation \nwhere soaring food and fuel prices are severely affecting the poor, and undercutting achievements \nmade in poverty reduction. The Technical Working Group on Agriculture and Water of the Ministry \nof  Agriculture,  Forestry,  and  Fisheries  (MAFF)  and  the  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and \nMeteorology (MOWRAM) has formulated the Strategy for Agriculture and Water 2006\u201320107 which \nincludes  five  action  programs,  including  one  on  food  security.  The  Working  Group  on  Food \nSecurity has prepared Cambodia\u2019s National Strategic Framework for Food Security and Nutrition \n(SFFSN)8 covering the period 2008\u20132012, the stated goal of which is that by 2012, poor and food-\ninsecure Cambodians will have substantially improved physical and economic access to sufficient, \nsafe, and nutritious food at all times, in order to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for \nan  active  and  healthy  life.  This  is  to  be  achieved  through  increased  food  production  and \nemployment creation, better natural resource management, improved food use and utilization, \n                                                 \n7 Technical Working Group on Agriculture and Water. 2008.

However, \nCambodia\u2019s  efforts  to  maintain  the  SFFSN\u2019s  goal  and  objectives  are  being  threatened  by \nescalating food prices, high prices of crop inputs, and budgetary stress. Over the medium- to long-\nterm, the Government\u2019s main priorities in the ANR sector are improved productivity, increased \nvalue addition from production, improved food security and nutrition, enhanced energy security, \nand  the introduction  of  measures to  combat  the  effects of  climate  change.  These  are  to be \nachieved through improved research and extension, increased public investment in land and water, \nincreased private investment in marketing and the export chain, crop diversification, and policy and \ninstitutional reforms. \n \n6.  Medium- and Long-term Assistance to Address Food Security \n \n24.  In the ANR sector, Cambodia received $184 million for nine loans, $30 million for two grant \nprojects, and $18 million for 26 technical assistance (TA) projects from ADB since 1994. ADB\u2019s \noperations in Cambodia are defined by a three-pronged strategy of (i) policy and institutional \nreform  including  governance  reform,  (ii)  rehabilitation  and  construction  of  physical  and  social \ninfrastructure, and (iii) natural resource management. The first Agriculture Sector Program9 (1996\u2013\n2000),  addressed  land  legislation,  agricultural  inputs,  rural  infrastructure,  rural  finance,  public \nenterprises, and decentralization. The subsequent Agricultural Sector Development Program10 is \nan attempt to fill the gaps of the Agriculture Sector Program and to deepen the reform process with \na  view  to  improving  productivity  and  promoting  diversification,  private  agro-based  enterprise \ngrowth,  and  agricultural  commercialization  by  improving  access  to  production  factors,  quality \ninputs,  and  good  research  results,  and  by  eliminating  state  intervention  in  input  and  output \nmarkets. \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s country strategy and program11 for 2005\u20132009 aims to (i) foster broad-based private \nsector-led  economic  growth,  (ii)  support  inclusive  social  development,  and  (iii)  strengthen \ngovernance  for  development.  ADB's  country  operations  business  plan12  for  2008\u20132010  for \nCambodia seeks to enhance rural development to foster more inclusive growth, and to accelerate \npoverty reduction, especially around the Tonle Sap Basin. In addition to providing immediate \nassistance through the Emergency Food Assistance Project, subsequent interventions will be \nsequenced to ease some of the  key binding constraints to accelerated agricultural and rural \ndevelopment. Interventions will mostly be geared towards (i) improving the management of water \nresources and irrigation assets, as well as mitigating flood and drought risk; (ii) expanding the \nconnectivity internally between rural roads and the provincial and national network, and externally \nwith  emerging  subregional  transport  corridors;  (iii)  fostering  the  development  of  smallholder \nagricultural producers; and (iv) widening access for the poorest to rural water supply and sanitation \nand strengthening local community management capacity. These will be accompanied by private \nsector development and risk management through governance reform. In agriculture, the focus will \nshift to rural infrastructure and transport, rural credit, skills development, rural electrification, and \nservice delivery (Appendix 2). \n \n26.  In the medium to long term, ADB\u2019s assistance will provide the basis for (i) productivity \ngrowth;  (ii)  promoting  biosecurity;  (iii)  improving  access  to  information  and  communication \ntechnology; (iv) improving market access and income diversification; (v) better risk management; \n(vi)  continued  dialogue  with  the  Government  to  deepen  and  widen  policy  reform;  and  (vii) \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 1995.

Such \nassistance would be considered in the broader framework of agricultural linkages to the rural and \nwider national economy, and in cooperation with other development partners through cofinancing \narrangements.  \n  \n7.  Governance and Corruption \n \n27.  Good governance is at the core of ADB\u2019s operations in its developing member countries \nincluding Cambodia. ADB\u2019s governance and anticorruption policies and the Second Governance \nAction Plan, 2005\u2013200813 (GACAP II) adopted in 2006 outline a comprehensive approach to \nimproving  public  financial  management  (PFM),  strengthening  procurement  systems,  and \ncombating corruption. ADB helped the Government establish the National Audit Authority, which is \ncurrently  active  and  functional.  ADB  also  helped  formulate  the  Medium  Term  Expenditure \nFramework,14  which  is  regularly  issued  by  MEF.  Despite  efforts  by  the  Government,  weak \ngovernance continues to be a key challenge. Cambodia adopted the Public Financial Management \nReform Program: Strengthening Governance through Enhanced Public Financial Management in \nDecember  2004,  outlining  an  action  plan  for  PFM  reform  in  order  to  raise  standards  of \nmanagement and accountability in the mobilization, effectiveness, and efficiency in the utilization of \nGovernment resources. In April 2007, the Government agreed to implement GACAP II under the \nADB-financed regional TA Governance and Capacity Development15 project. The World Bank, \nDepartment  for  International  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom,  and  ADB  have  jointly \ndetermined that PFM, public administration reform, and decentralization require immediate priority \nattention. ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for 2005\u20132009 recognizes good governance as \ncritical to improving the responsiveness, cost-effectiveness, and quality of public service delivery.     \n \n28.  Public procurement, which is an area generally associated with a high level of corruption, is \nundergoing major reforms. The procurement process lacks effective control mechanisms, and \nthere is no effective regulatory framework to regulate procurement practices. In order to avoid \ncorruption and fraud in the procurement process, the Government mandated the use of Standard \nOperating Procedures (SOP) and Procurement Manual16 on 26 February 2007. Both documents \nare in line with ADB guidelines. Internal control procedures specified in the SOP and Financial \nManagement Manual17 are applied in project management, internal control, and reporting. ADB \nlooks at public financial management as an enabling condition for poverty reduction and good \ngovernance. Under a proposed ADB-funded project,18 assistance will be provided to improve PFM \ncapacities for achieving aggregate fiscal discipline in rural priority sectors in order to improve \nservice delivery to the rural population. \n    \n  8.  Lessons  \n \n29.  Public procurement and distribution of food through an emergency food reserve system and \nregular safety-net programs are relatively new to Cambodia. WFP and a number of NGOs have \nbeen supporting safety-net programs, such as food-for-work and food-for-education programs, and \ntuberculosis and AIDS sufferers for a number of years. These programs are usually run through \n                                                 \n13  ADB. 2006. Second Governance and Anti-Corruption Action Plan (2005\u20132008). Manila. \n14  ADB. 2006.

At  the  onset  of  the  food  price  crisis,  the  Government \nmobilized NCDM, MOC, Green Trade, and the rice millers association to undertake procurement \nand distribution of food, including support to WFP (para 18). The present crisis is a learning \nexperience for the Government, and the situation warrants the need to develop its capacity for an \nemergency response system for food security and expand its social safety-net programs. The \nexperiences from countries such as India and Bangladesh, where governments have relatively \ngood  records  of  managing  public  food  distribution  through  well-targeted  and  well-managed \nprograms, will be useful for Cambodia. These models can provide a solid basis for supporting the \ndevelopment of an envisaged food security reserve system, and provide Cambodia with several \nadaptable models for its safety-net programs, many of which have added social benefits, such as \nthe  use  of  food-for-work  programs  to  support  the  construction  and  maintenance  of  essential \ninfrastructure\u2014rural roads, river embankments, irrigation, and other public facilities. \n \n30.  An important factor limiting immediate and medium-term productivity enhancement is the \nabsence of financing from microfinance institutions for operational inputs for small and marginal \nfarmers. Mobilizing effective credit delivery from among the microfinance institutions to provide \nshort-term credit to the target farmers and households has proven to be difficult. The segment of \npopulation to be covered by the Project will have difficulty fulfilling the eligibility criteria of the \nmicrofinance institutions, an issue currently being examined by the ongoing project preparatory TA \nfor the Tonle Sap Smallholder Development and Poverty Reduction Project19 due to start in 2009 \nwith cofinancing possibilities from IFAD and the Government of Finland. In addition to supporting a \nstrategy that combines technology, infrastructure, and market access, this upcoming project is \nexpected to address policy concerns in rural microfinance, develop sustainable credit financing for \nsmallholders, and support the transitional requirements of credit to farmers for increasing and \nsustaining farm productivity. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n31.  The expected impact is reduced vulnerability of food-insecure households in Cambodia. \nThe expected outcome is improved access to sufficient food by food-insecure Cambodians in the \ntarget provinces. The Project will improve the immediate food security of an estimated 500,000 \npoor and vulnerable people affected by higher food prices through higher food intake. The lowest \nquintile of farmers (the poorest 20% of the national population), who are also net food buyers, will \nbe able to increase food production, and employment and income of households with limited \npurchasing power will increase. The Project will reduce the poverty of low-income groups and \ncontribute to the efforts of the Government to strengthen the safety-net programs for poor and \nvulnerable population in the face of rising food prices. The Project will emphasize improving access \nof the poor to food, income, and livelihood support. It will assist in relieving fiscal pressures caused \nby a sharp rise in safety-net program expenditure.  \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n32.  The  Project  consists  of  three  components:  (i)  compensatory  consumption  support \ncomprising (a) food distribution, and (b) a food-for-work program; (ii) productivity enhancement \nsupport; and (iii) capacity development for emergency response to the food crisis, and Project \nmanagement. Three expected outputs are (i) increased availability of food to vulnerable households; \n                                                 \n19 ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Preparing the Tonle Sap Poverty Reduction and \nSmallholder Development Project. Manila, \n ", "12   \n \n(ii) supported input needs of smallholders and marginal farmers; and (iii) an operational national food \nsecurity response system. The Project design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n33.  Component 1: Compensatory Consumption Support. Under this component food will be \nprovided for free distribution among selected families and for the food-for-work program. This \ncomponent will encompass (i) identification of target groups for free food distribution and the food-for-\nwork program; (ii) procurement of rice, transport, and storage; (iii) free rice distribution to target \ngroups; (iv) free food distribution (cash transfer or voucher system) to selected urban poor in Phnom \nPenh; (v) provision of food to the Government\u2019s school feeding and take home ration programs; (vi) \nprovision of food to children in selected early childhood learning centers (ECLCs); (vii) organization of \ntarget  groups  for  the  food-for-work  program;  and  (viii)  organization  of  technical  support  and \nmanagement of the food-for-work program. Activities under the food-for-work program will include \nrehabilitation of small tertiary irrigation canals and village roads, which will mainly involve manual \ndredging, resurfacing, cutting grass, and filling up road holes within the existing right-of-way. The \nrehabilitation of small tertiary irrigation canals will help optimize the Project assistance by completing \nthe essential package of water\u2013seed\u2013fertilizer that will contribute to increased production in the \ncoming crop seasons. The rehabilitation of village roads will help enhance connectivity among \nvillages and communes, ensuring better access to markets and social services. Construction of \nnew  canals  or  roads  will  not  be  undertaken  under  this  food-for-work  program.  Specific  work \naccounts will be identified during implementation based on the needs assessment and selection \ncriteria. It is envisaged that each individual work account will not exceed $5,000. The program will \ncomply with national labor laws and regulations, particularly on child labor, and provide equal pay \nfor equal work regardless of gender and ethnicity. \n \n34.  Component 2: Productivity Enhancement Support. Under this component, seed and \nfertilizer will be sold to selected farmers at subsidized prices. This component will include (i) \nidentification of target groups (farmers) for subsidized seed and fertilizer distribution; (ii) procurement, \ntransport, and storage of seed and fertilizer; and (iii) sale of seed and fertilizer at subsidized prices to \ntarget beneficiaries. Smallholders and marginal farmers, the majority of whom are net food buyers, \nwill receive subsidized fertilizer and seed together with extension services, and, where feasible, \nthese will be combined with supplementary irrigation which will be enhanced by field channels and \nsubsidiary canals rehabilitated under the food-for-work program.  \n \n35.  Component 3: Capacity Development for Emergency Response to Food Crisis and \nProject  Management.  This  component  has  three  parts:  (i)  establishment  of  an  independent \nmonitoring system to oversee target-group selection, distribution of food and inputs, organization \nand management of the food-for-work program, and compliance with fiduciary requirements; (ii) \nestablishment of a system of emergency food reserve and rapid response, which will involve (a) \nsurveys and diagnosis of the current nationwide food security situation; (b) institutional analysis of \nthe food procurement, storage, transportation, and distribution system; (c) essential hardware and \nlogistics support and related facilities to enhance the capacity of NCDM and PCDMs in the Project \nprovinces to respond to the food crisis; and (d) baseline surveys and monitoring and data collection \nin the Project areas; and (iii) strengthening financial management capacity of the executing agency \n(EA), implementing agencies (IAs), and provincial project management units (PPMUs) in Project \nmanagement  and  monitoring.  These  are  designed  to  enhance  the  Government\u2019s  longer-term \ncapability to deal with food emergencies, and provide support to ongoing efforts at sustaining the \ngrowth of productivity by minimizing the impacts of natural disaster.  \n   \nC.  Special Features \n36.  ADB\u2019s  Framework  of  Response  to  the  Soaring  Food  Prices.  The  design  of  the \nproposed Project follows ADB\u2019s response to the soaring food prices presented in Soaring Food \n ", "    13\n   \nPrices, Response to the Crisis20 which was released by the President of ADB at its Annual Meeting \nin Madrid in May 2008. The Project provides a strong link between short-term emergency relief \nassistance and medium- to long-term production and productivity growth, generating a supply \nresponse together with institution building for food emergency response.   \n \n37.  Consultation,  Coordination,  and  Partnerships.  The  Project  was  designed  in  close \nconsultation with the Government, civil society, and development partners active in Cambodia both \nat the central level and Project provinces. The Project preparation team visited seven provinces21 \nand  11  communes22  holding  in-depth  discussion  with  officials,  civil  society  members,  local \ngovernment representatives, and beneficiaries in order to assess the need for assistance, and \nissues  related  to  food  emergency  preparedness,  immediate  productivity  increase,  method  of \nidentification of beneficiaries, and fiduciary controls. The needs assessment was shared with, and \nfeedback on the Project design was obtained from, development partners including representatives \nof the World Bank, European Commission, UNDP, WFP, FAO, and Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr \nTechnische Zusammenarbeit (German Agency for Technical Cooperation). The World Bank and \nEuropean Commission are expected to complement the Government\u2019s effort to provide food, \ninputs,  and  income  assistance  to  the  vulnerable  population  using  the  Project-developed \nmethodology. In addition, the Project will provide a special opportunity for deepening Government \nand NGO partnership.  \n \n38.  Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy (DEAP). The Project will be implemented \npursuant to the DEAP23 and in accordance with the Action Plan24 for its implementation, which \ndefines disaster as a series of disruptions to the functioning of a community or a society causing \nwidespread human, material, economic or environmental losses that exceed the ability of the \naffected community or society to cope using its own resources. ADB's Disaster and Emergency \nAssistance  Policy,  expressly  contemplates  the  inclusion  of  quick-disbursing  components  in \nemergency assistance loans to finance immediate and urgent procurements.25 The draw down for \nthe  retroactive  financing  and  the  advance  to  the  imprest  account will  be  quick-disbursing  as \nprovided under the policy. \n \n39.  One-off  Emergency  Measure.  All  interventions  are  one-off  short-term  emergency \nmeasures, while long-term measures, such as operational national food security response systems \nand productivity enhancement programs, are in place. The proposed one-off subsidy on rice seeds \nand  fertilizers  will  help  farmers  recover  and  maintain  and  increase  crop  yields,  enabling \nreinvestments of surplus in the succeeding crop seasons, and ensuring adequacy of community \nfood-grain stocks. The Government, ADB, and a number of development partners are working \ntogether on policy issues and productivity enhancement concerns in agriculture, particularly in the \nTonle Sap Basin. The one-off support for a national food security response system will help the \nGovernment develop a more sustainable safety-net program to tackle food emergencies in the \nfuture through the implementation of component 3 and the attached TA.   \n                                                 \n20 ADB. 2008.

It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $17.5 million equivalent in special drawing rights \nand a grant not exceeding the equivalent of $17.5 million, both from its Special Fund resources, to \nfinance 87.32% of the total Project cost. The Government will finance taxes and duties of $3.54 \nmillion, and recurrent costs of $1.54 million accounting for 12.68% of the total Project cost. The \nloan and grant will finance the Project on a joint basis. The loan portion will carry an interest rate of \n1% per year, a maturity of 40 years and a grace period of 10 years, with repayment of principal at \n2%  per  year  for  the  first  10  years  after  the  grace  period,  and  4%  per  year  thereafter.  The \nGovernment will bear the foreign exchange risk related to the loan. Interest charges on the loan \nare to be capitalized.

Cambodia is eligible for Asian Development Fund (ADF) grants. Cambodia\u2019s fiscal and \nforeign  exchange  resources  as  well  as  donor  funds  are  inadequate  to  meet  wide-ranging \nemergency requirements arising from soaring food, input, and energy prices. Cambodia\u2019s debt \nsustainability  analysis  suggests  the  need  to  channel  a  significant  portion  of  development \nassistance in grants for years to come. \n \n44.  Cofinancing Opportunities. The  Government  has  requested  financing  from  other \ndevelopment partners, especially from the World Bank. During a needs assessment mission, a \nnumber  of  development  partners  showed  their  willingness  to  complement  ADB\u2019s  fund  for \nemergency food assistance. The World Bank has recently held discussions with ADB on needs \nassessment and cofinancing. It has indicated that up to $40 million from its poverty reduction grant \noperation could be made available for Cambodia, and it is willing to work with ADB and the \nGovernment in using these funds for additional activities under the Project.  \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n \n45.  The Project will utilize existing effective delivery mechanisms and institutions, and enhance \ntheir capacity as appropriate. MEF will be the Project EA, while the proposed IAs will be: (i) MAFF \nfor the seed and fertilizer assistance; (ii) Ministry of Rural Development (MRD) for the food-for-work \nprogram; (iii) MOWRAM for the food-for-work program; (iv) MOC for the emergency food security \nsystem; (v) NCDM and PCDMs in seven Project provinces for overall coordination, management, \nand distribution of food and input assistance, and establishment of the emergency food security \nreserve and rapid response system; (vi) MOEYS for the school feeding program; (vii) MOWA for \nthe ECLC feeding program; and (vii) commune councils and village development committees \n(VDCs)  for  identification  of  target  groups  and  distribution  of  food  and  inputs.  The  Project \nimplementation and funds flow diagram are in Appendix 5. \n \n46.  The National Food Security Task Force (NFSTF), headed by MEF and with representation \nfrom concerned Government ministries and agencies and key development partners, will provide \noverall policy guidance to Project implementation. A central project management unit (CPMU), led \nby a Project director, will be established at MEF to oversee daily implementation. Provincial project \nmanagement  units  (PPMUs)  will  be  established  in  all  seven  Project  provinces,  and  will  be \nresponsible  for  organizing  Project  activities  comprising  target-group  selection,  procurement, \nstorage,  and  distribution  of  food,  rice  seeds,  and  fertilizer  in  their  respective  provinces,  and \nreporting to the CPMU on all matters relating to the Project management in their respective \nprovinces. In view of the fast-track processing under the Disaster and Emergency Policy, and \nprocurement requirements of the Project, the Government established the CPMU and appointed \nthe Project director immediately after the signing of the memorandum of understanding, and has \nadvised ADB thereon. \n ", "16   \n \n \n47.  Technical support units will be established at each implementing ministry or department. \nInterministerial and interdepartmental coordination will be assured by NCDM at the central level \nand by the PCDM (chaired by the provincial governor) at the provincial level. Selected commune \ncouncils, assisted by respective VDCs, will be responsible for receiving, storing, and distributing \n(free)  rice,  seed,  and  fertilizers  to  the  target  groups  in  accordance  with  a  list  of  potential \nbeneficiaries  prepared  through  a  participatory  process by  commune  councils and  VDCs,  and \nagreed upon by the PCDM on the basis of the criteria outlined in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n48.  The  food-for-work  program  will  be  implemented  through  available  effective  existing \nGovernment structures of MRD, MOWRAM, MOEYS, and MOWA in the Project areas, including \nthe  commune  councils.  Where  such  capacities  are  lacking,  other  competent  organizations, \nincluding UN agencies, will be contracted to implement the food-for-work program. MAFF will \nprovide extension services to assist farmers in the optimal utilization of the seed, fertilizers, and \nwater package. Quality control of rice, seed, and fertilizers will be carried out jointly by designated \ndepartments of MAFF and MOC. \n \n49.  Preparation of the list of target beneficiaries and procurement and distribution of rice, seed, \nand fertilizers will be supervised and monitored by independent monitors reporting to ADB and \nNFSTF (paragraph 56), and technically supported by qualified experts from the respective IAs, as \nmay be required. Consultant support will be provided to the respective IAs for capacity-building \npurposes and to ensure timely execution of Project activities. NCDM will receive support to develop \na framework to establish a national emergency food security reserve and rapid response system, \nincluding expansion of existing community rice banks. \n \n50.  The  Government  envisages  closer  guidance  and  supervision  by  ADB  throughout  the \nimplementation of the Project. In view of the emergency nature of the Project, the Government has \nrequested  ADB  to  administer  the  specialist  inputs  and  consulting  services.  To  ensure  timely \nimplementation, staff at ADB headquarters will work closely with staff at the ADB Cambodia \nResident Mission, which will assign one dedicated staff member to monitor Project compliance with \nADB requirements to ensure quality control and accelerated implementation through regular follow-\nup,  and  provide  guidance  to  the  relevant  IAs  on  project  implementation  matters.  Extended \nmissions by ADB will be required to provide constant supervision during the early phase of Project \nimplementation. ADB will redeploy one professional staff member to the resident mission early \n2009, and a staff consultant experienced in audit will also be recruited. The Tonle Sap Initiative \nCoordination Unit, based at the Cambodia Resident Mission, will assist the resident mission in \nproviding necessary oversight functions.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n51.  The Project implementation period will be from 1 October 2008 to 31 March 2011. The \nProject implementation plan is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n  \n3.  Procurement \n52.  The Project will entail the procurement of rice, seed, fertilizers, vehicles, office equipment, \nand  a  large  number  of  community-based  civil  works  under  the  food-for-work  program.  All \nprocurement  to  be  financed  under  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Retroactive  financing  for  a \nmaximum of 30% of the total loan and grant amounts will be considered for eligible expenditure \nincurred not earlier than 22 August 2008, provided that the expenditure is in compliance with the \nfollowing conditions: (i) it is in accordance with acceptable procedures specified by ADB, (ii) it is \n ", "    17\n   \nverified by ADB, (iii) it is certified by MEF, and (iv) the certification is acceptable to ADB. ADB will \naudit the use of the loan proceeds in accordance with its fiduciary responsibilities and verify the \naccuracy of Government certification. The Government has been advised by ADB that provision of \nretroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance any part of the Project. \n \n53.  No international procurement is envisaged under the Project. Rice will be procured directly \nfrom a list of prequalified and approved rice millers who will be selected based on capacity \nassessment and financial status. This selection will be conducted in consultation with provincial \nand central rice millers associations. Procurement of rice will involve multiple awards for partial \nquantities based on the needs of the provinces and various programs. In accordance with the \nProcurement Guidelines, suppliers will be invited to quote prices linked to the market price. These \ncontracts may also include delivery options. Fertilizer will also be procured in phases. National \ncompetitive bidding procedures, acceptable to ADB, will be adopted. Similar procedures will also \nbe adopted for procurement of vehicles. Flexible procedures pursuant to the provisions under \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines will be adopted. \n \n54.  During 2000\u20132008, AusAID assisted in developing and implementing the Agriculture Quality \nImprovement Program (AQIP) which developed a number of seed production centers that were \nsuccessful in developing high-yielding rice seeds suitable for Cambodia. Subsequently, the AQIP \nSeed Company was incorporated as a registered commercial entity. This entity is largely owned by \nthe private sector, with some ownership maintained by research institutes. The company has \ndeveloped a commercially viable business for the production and distribution of high-quality rice \nseeds. Regional production centers have been established which provide cleaned, tested, and \npackaged rice seeds to farmers, dealers, government, and nongovernment agencies. Under this \nProject, procurement of the rice seeds will be serviced by the AQIP Seed Company following direct \ncontracting procedures, along with provision for direct procurement of rice seeds from local seed \nproducers  associations.  The  food-for-work  program  will  involve  a  large  number  of  small, \ncommunity-based small contracts for which compensation will be in the form of food, in accordance \nwith existing procedures under various government programs as well as under UN-sponsored \nprograms.  Before  the  commencement  of  any  procurement  activity  under  national  competitive \nbidding, ADB and the borrower will review the relevant agency\u2019s capacity to ensure compliance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. The procurement plan is in Appendix 6. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n55.  The Project will require 325 person-months of consulting services, comprising 75 person-\nmonths of international consultants and 250 person-months of national consultants. The Project \nwill also provide independent monitoring services by local NGOs. It is proposed that the cost of \nconsulting services and independent monitoring will be financed by both the allocated fund under \ncomponent 3 and an attached TA project for strengthening the Government\u2019s capacity to respond \nto food crisis and improving food security, and enhancing fiduciary oversight of the Project. All \nconsultants, including the independent monitors, will be recruited by ADB in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time). Para 64 describes the \ntechnical assistance and Appendix 7 provides cost estimates and a financing plan; outline terms of \nreference for consultants are provided in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n \n5.  Project Monitoring and Anticorruption Measures \n56.  Strong Oversight Mechanisms to Manage Fiduciary Risks. Emergency assistance must \nbe supported by sound financial management and operational procedures, as well as monitoring \nand evaluation mechanisms. The Cambodia Resident Mission will closely monitor compliance with \nADB\u2019s requirements under the Project to reduce fiduciary risks in the implementation of the safety-\n ", "18   \n \nnet programs. Strengthened fiduciary risk mitigation measures, such as quality government audit \nassurance, as well as performance audits and independent monitoring by local NGOs, will be \nadopted  under  the  proposed  project.  Considering  the  Government\u2019s  expanded  safety-net \nprograms, joint fiduciary oversight arrangements will be established with the participation of ADB, \nindependent audit experts, and the Government. To strengthen field monitoring of food and input \ndistribution and execution of the food-for-work program, the Government has agreed to utilize the \nservices of competent NGOs as independent monitors who will report directly to the NFSTF and \nADB. The Project quarterly report will cover the progress and expected completion date of the \nprocurement of food grains, and on their distribution through different safety-net programs. \n \n57.  Governance  issues  are  of  major  concern  in  the  Project.  Necessary  safeguards  and \nsupervision will be provided under the attached TA to ensure transparent food procurement and \ndistribution  operations.  The  Cambodia  Resident  Mission  will  closely  monitor  anticorruption \nmeasures undertaken by the EA, and will carry out random checks on procurement and accounts \nof the EA, IAs, and PPMUs, and inspect procurement activities and storage facilities under the \nProject. Other anticorruption measures will include (i) strict financial management with submission \nof annual audited accounts and internal audit report by the EA; (ii) strengthened Government \nmonitoring; (iii) strong Project supervision; (iv) periodic reviews of accounts and statements of \nexpenditure (SOEs); (v) close monitoring of the investments and safety-net programs under the \nProject; and (vi) close coordination of the Project with the proposed Public Financial Management \nfor Rural Development Project26. The list of specific governance risk mitigation measures that have \nbeen taken into consideration in designing the Project is in Appendix 8.  \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy   \n58.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  of  Cambodia.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. The \nGovernment and the EA agree to cooperate with any such investigation and extend the necessary \nassistance,  including  access  to  all  relevant  books  and  records,  as  well  as  engagement  of \nindependent experts that may be needed for satisfactory completion of such investigations. To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan \nregulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB \nin connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of the EA and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other \nservice  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  The  Project  incorporates  several  specific \nanticorruption measures, including (i) strict financial management with strengthened Government \naccounting, auditing, monitoring, and independent monitoring and review by TA consultants; (ii) \nstrong project supervision of public procurement and distribution of food grains financed from this \nloan with appropriate consultancy input; (iii) delegation of project administration to the Cambodia \nResident Mission; and (iv) random and independent spot checks by ADB officials and the project \nconsultants. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n59.  Project funds will flow from ADB to MEF (CPMU), which will establish a Project imprest \naccount at the National Bank of Cambodia. The initial ceiling of the imprest account will be the \nlower of the estimated expenditures to be funded from the imprest account for the first 6 months, or \n                                                 \n26 ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Preparing the Strengthening of Public Financial \nManagement for Rural Development. Manila. \n ", "    19\n   \n10% of the grant or loan amount. A specific increase in these ceilings may be sought at a later time \nbased on the needs of the Project. Funds will flow to various IAs to finance the activities they are \nindividually responsible for. Each PPMU will establish a second generation imprest account (SGIA) \nat the National Bank of Cambodia. A total of seven SGIAs (one for each PPMU) will be opened \nunder  the Project.  The  initial ceiling  of each  SGIA  will be  equivalent  to  6  months  estimated \nexpenditures to be funded from the imprest account, or $50,000, whichever is lower. Funds will \nflow  to  subproject  bank  accounts  held  at  the  various  IAs  to  finance  the  activities  they  are \nindividually responsible for. The IA\u2019s will be required to submit full supporting documentation to the \nCPMU or PPMU as the basis of funding the accounts. The CPMU and each PPMU will open two \nsets of imprest accounts (one for the grant fund and another for the loan fund, as appropriate). The \nSOE  procedure  will  be  used  to  liquidate  and  replenish  the  imprest  accounts  for  eligible \nexpenditures. Any individual payment to be reimbursed or liquidated under this procedure shall not \nexceed the equivalent of $50,000. SOE documentation will be retained at the CPMU and PPMUs. \nImprest  account  and  SOE  records  will  be  audited  during  the  annual  audit  process.  All \ndisbursements  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). The EA and IAs will be responsible for managing and administering \nthe imprest account in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.  \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n60.  The EA will maintain records and accounts adequate to identify the goods financed by the \nloan proceeds. Project accounts will be set up in accordance with sound accounting principles. The \nEA will ensure that the consolidated Project accounts and related financial statements will be audited \nannually by an independent audit authority of Cambodia. The audited reports and related financial \nstatements in English will be submitted to ADB not later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year \nto which they relate. In addition to the Government audit, for the procurement of goods financed from \nthe loan and grant, ADB or its agents will undertake a special audit which could involve independent \nfinancial  and  performance  auditing  and  review  to  ensure  transparency,  financial  integrity,  and \nobjective performance assessment of the goods procured and distributed from this loan. A separate \naudit opinion is to be issued on the use of imprest accounts, including SGIAs, and the use of SOE \nprocedure.  Financial  and  performance  monitoring  and  review,  including  spot  checks,  will  be \nconducted from time to time during and after the Project period and be carried out by external private \nsector auditors or by ADB. The Government will provide ADB, through the EA, with a midterm and \nan overall Project completion report, providing a detailed evaluation of the Project design, costs, \nperformance, social and economic impact, and other details as requested by ADB. \n     \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring System \n \n61.  A project performance management system (PPMS) will be developed on the basis of the \nProject design and monitoring framework to examine the Project\u2019s technical performance, evaluate \ndelivery of Project facilities, assess achievement of Project objectives, and measure the Project\u2019s \nsocial, economic, financial, and institutional impacts. The EA will be responsible for developing and \noperating the PPMS with information provided by PPMUs and IAs, and will report monthly to ADB. \nProgress monitoring, safeguard monitoring, and benefit monitoring and evaluation will be carried \nout during project implementation. Post-evaluation review will be carried out 3 years after project \ncompletion. Baseline, covering both target and control groups, and periodic surveys will be carried \nout through subcontracting competent local NGOs, who will collect data disaggregated by income \ngroup, gender, types of vulnerability, and other characteristics as appropriate. The EA will maintain \na Project-specific webpage, in English and Khmer, on its official website for wider dissemination of \nprocurement  and  distribution-related  information,  and  to  provide  a  feedback  mechanism. \nConsultant services will be provided to assist the EA and IAs to develop and implement the PPMS. \n \n ", "20   \n \n62.  In addition, an independent monitoring system will be established to conduct monitoring of \nbeneficiary screening and selection, and project procedures, including fiduciary compliances. The \nindependent monitors will report to NFSTF and ADB. The IAs will provide the CPMU with monthly \nand quarterly progress reports, as appropriate, which will be consolidated into a single progress \nreport for the Project. The consolidated report will be submitted to ADB. The CPMU, together with \nPPMUs and IAs, will establish the baseline indicators at the commune level within 3 months of \nProject  inception  from  secondary  sources,  baseline  survey,  and  participatory  observations.  A \nProject completion report will be prepared by the CPMU and submitted to ADB within 3 months \nafter completion of the project. \n \n9.  Project Review \n \n63.  ADB will conduct regular reviews throughout Project implementation, at least twice a year. \nThe reviews will assess implementation performance and achievements of Project outcomes and \nobjectives, examine financial progress, identify issues and constraints affecting the Project, and \nwork  out  time-bound  action  plans  for  their  resolution.  Given  the  implementation  period  and \nemergency  nature  of  the  Project,  no  midterm  review  will  be  conducted  unless  ADB  and  the \nGovernment deem it necessary.    \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n64.  An attached TA project of $1.6 million will strengthen the Government\u2019s capacity to deal \nwith food crises and related emergencies. ADB will finance $1.5 million of the TA project on a grant \nbasis from its TA funding program, and the Government will contribute $100,000. The TA fund, \ntogether  with  the  allocated  fund  under  component  3,  will  help  (i)  establish  an  independent \nmonitoring system to oversee target-group selection, distribution of food and inputs, organization \nand management of the food-for-work program, and compliance with fiduciary requirements; (ii) \ndevelop  a  system  of  emergency  food  reserve  and  rapid  response;  (iii)  strengthen  financial \nmanagement  capacity  of  the  EA,  IA,  and  PPMUs,  including  capability  to  deal  with  food \nemergencies;  and  (iv)  manage  and  monitor  Project  implementation.  The  TA  will  finance \ninternational and national consulting services and independent monitoring services in conjunction \nwith  the  consulting  services  financed  through  the  Project  funds.  Appendix  7  provides  cost \nestimates and a financing plan. The outline terms of reference is in Supplementary Appendix E. \nConsultants  will  be  recruited  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Retroactive financing for a maximum of 30% of \nthe TA amounts will be considered for eligible expenditure incurred not earlier than 22 August \n2008. \n   \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Socioeconomic Benefits and Impacts \n1.   Impacts on Consumers \n \n65.  Rice is the staple food item in Cambodia and constitutes 50% of the total food consumption \nof poor families. Between March 2007 and May 2008, rice prices in Cambodia doubled. Such \nfluctuations in the price of rice will have an impact on poverty reduction efforts; it was predicted that \na 10% increase of the rice price would increase the national poverty rate by 0.5% (in both rural and \nurban areas). In addition to critically low levels of global food stocks and higher production and \ntransport costs, the problem posed by high global rice prices has been compounded by export \nrestrictions from large exporting countries and significant rice purchases from importing countries \nat higher prices. \n ", "    21\n   \n \n66.   The  Project  will  enhance  food  entitlement  of  the  vulnerable,  increase  production,  and \ncontribute to medium-  and long-term productivity growth. About 500,000 residents, or 89,000 \nhouseholds, living in and around the Tonle Sap Basin27 and three slum areas28 in Phnom Penh will \nbenefit from the proposed Project assistance. The Project will contribute to the restoration of the \npurchasing power of the poor and vulnerable who are at greater risk of hunger and malnutrition. In \nso doing, it will ease the negative impacts of rising food prices mentioned earlier. Greater food \navailability will ease the pressure of starvation and reduce the risk of loss of lives, particularly in \nrural areas. Nutritional status will improve for the urban slum dwellers, economic migrants and their \nfamilies, fixed-income people, wage workers, landless, poor rural families, and families affected by \nHIV. This is particularly crucial for the people who are chronically vulnerable and are therefore at \nrisk of undernutrition and malnutrition. \n \n2.   Impacts on Producers \n \n67.   A  major  part  of  the  Project  financing  (approximately  67%)  will  be  used  to  finance \nproductivity enhancement by way of appropriate seed, fertilizer, and irrigation and rural roads \n(under the food-for-work program). The assistance will cover about 200,000 hectares (ha) of \nproductive  rice  land,  which  is  cultivated  by  smallholders  and  marginal  farmers  for  two  crops \nannually (rainy and dry season crops). Within the context of rising crop input prices, Project \nassistance will help smallholders and marginal farmers continue to produce rice to take advantage \nof the rising rice market price. Discussions with various farmer groups during the fact-finding \nmission indicated that rising input prices have made them think of alternatives, including reducing \ninputs for the same crop area, using no inorganic inputs for rice crops, selling land, and looking for \na daily wage job in urban centers. The assistance through the Project will enable smallholders and \nmarginal farmers to afford crop inputs for continued rice production. The application of crop inputs \n(seed and fertilizer) along with extension services will directly improve rice harvests, and enable \ntargeted  households  to  meet  food  needs  and  reinvest  surpluses  in  subsequent  production \nseasons. This will serve as a springboard for many to uplift their livelihoods. \n \n68.  Rising  input  prices  have  seriously  reduced  affordability  and  willingness  of  farmer \nhouseholds (particularly smallholders and marginal farmers) to purchase appropriate crop inputs \nand, in the majority of cases, farmers will decide to grow rice with low-quality seed and without \nessential nutrient input (fertilizer). Based on the Project financing plan, it is estimated that Project \nassistance will cover a rice production area of about 200,000 ha.29 The Project will help ease the \nfinancial pressure of rising input prices and enable target farmer households to use quality seed \nand  fertilizer  to  restore  crop  productivity.  Support  for  proposed  productivity  enhancement \ncomponent under the project will contribute significantly to increased crop yield and stability of \nCambodia\u2019s national rice production and rice stock.   \n \n69.  An impact analysis was conducted on rising prices of seed and fertilizer on rice crop yields \nfor  the  without-project  and  with-project  scenarios.  Field  data  collected  during  the  fact-finding \nmission indicated that seed prices increased from $300/t in 2007 to $400/t in June 2008, and \nfertilizer prices increased from $434/t in 2007 to $627/t in June 2008. According to the Institute for \nMekong Delta Rice Research in 2007, about 60% of the land used for growing rice in the Tonle \nSap Basin is cultivated using 50 kilograms (kg)/ha of fertilizer per crop, and the average yield is 2.5 \nt/ha of paddy rice per crop. Based on available information provided by the institute and field \ninformation on targeted low-income farmers in the Tonle Sap Basin provinces, it is assumed that \n                                                 \n27 Provinces of Banteay Meanchey, Battambang, Kampong Chhnang, Kampong Thom, Odor Meanchey, Pursat, and Siem \nReap. \n28 Beungkok, Stung Meanchey, and the Riverside. \n29 The total land area available for rice cultivation in Cambodia is estimated at 2.54 million ha. \n ", "22   \n \n40% of 200,000 ha operated by the targeted farmers is cultivated using 50 kg/ha of fertilizer per \ncrop, and the average yield is 2.5 t/ha per crop. Due to the increase in prices of seed and fertilizer, \nthe area cultivated using fertilizer by low-income farmers would fall from 40% to 20% in 2008, 15% \nin 2009, and 10% in 2010. As a consequence, the total annual yield would fall from the 2007 level \nof 404,500 t to 101,100 t in 2010. The Project assistance is assumed to help restore the 2007 \nproductivity level. From the perspective of Cambodia\u2019s national rice stock, the analysis indicates \nthat in the without-project scenario, the national rice stock surplus is estimated to fall from 1.27 \nmillion t at year-end 2007 to an average annual level of 0.88 million t for the 2008\u20132010 period. As \na result of the above analysis, the Project support would contribute to restore this level during \n2008\u20132010 to ensure national food security (Supplementary Appendix F).  \n  \nB.  Poverty and Social Impacts \n70.  The Project will help to restore the purchasing power of the poor and vulnerable who are at \ngreater  risk  of  hunger  and  malnutrition.  Those  most  vulnerable  to  food  price  shocks  will  be \nprotected from nutritional deprivation, erosion in real income, and asset shedding. No negative \nsocial impact is foreseen from any Project activity. The major social impacts of the Project are \nexpected to be positive. The nutritional status and food security of the target population will \nimprove, and poverty will be reduced. Women, especially those who are heads of households, will \nbenefit  through  improved  entitlement  to  food  and  enhanced  income-earning  opportunities \nsupported by credit, skills development, and market access. Pregnant and lactating women will \nreceive nutritional supplements. Particular effort will be made to ensure participation of ethnic \nminorities. There will be no resettlement issue under any of the activities supported by the Project. \nThe summary poverty reduction and social strategy is outlined in Appendix 9. \n \nC.  Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement \n71.  A resettlement framework was not prepared since the Project will not involve any land \nacquisition and resettlement. \n \nD.  Environmental Impacts \n72.  The proposed Project aims to reduce vulnerability of food-insecure households through \nincreased access to food and production inputs. As part of the food-for-work program, rehabilitation \nof  needed  rural  infrastructure  will  be  carried  out  to  provide  employment  opportunities  for \ncommunities and facilitate improved productivity, connectivity, and access to markets and social \nservices. Specific work accounts and communes will be identified during implementation based on \nthe needs and selection criteria, including environmental screening criteria. Since rehabilitation is \nsmall in scale and community-based, and mainly done by manual labor in a participatory manner in \ntarget villages, significant potential impacts that would require field analysis are not anticipated. \nTherefore, the Project is classified as Category C. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigations \n73.  The Government\u2019s social safety-net programs for protecting the poor and vulnerable groups \nare underdeveloped, and relevant institutions are weak in their capacity to run the social safety-net \nprograms. The concept of a food security reserve system is relatively new to the country, and \nconcerned institutions lack operational skills and management experience. The Project design \nprovides  for  addressing  these  institutional  weaknesses  through  one  of  the  Project  outputs, \ncomponent 3 (Capacity Development for Food Crisis and Project Management). The component \nscope provides for (i) establishment of an independent monitoring system, (ii) establishment of a \nsystem of emergency food reserve and rapid response, and (iii) strengthening the capacity of the \n ", "    23\n   \nEA and IAs. Governance of the program will have built-in transparency and accountability with \noutput monitoring and independent evaluation of effects and impact. The Project and attached TA \ninclude definitive fiduciary oversight of the funds provided and disbursed.  \n \n74.  The immediate procurement program may face risks if there is a shortage of grain, seed, \nand fertilizer for purchase internally and externally, in which case prices will be high, thereby using \na significant share of project resources. This risk can be mitigated by staggering the purchase of \ngrains  and  extensive  canvassing  among  potential  suppliers  to  ensure  adequate  supply  at \nreasonable price both within the Project provinces and other surplus localities. Given that seed \nsupply sources in the country are limited, AQIP Seed Company has been identified as the main \nsupplier of seed, and provision has been made for direct procurement of rice seeds from seed \nproducers associations, if needed, for distribution to target farmers. Since the divestment of the \nnational agricultural inputs supply company, the private sector has successfully evolved as the \nimporter and supplier of fertilizers to local markets across the country.  \n \n75.  Linking  of  short-term  safety-net  programs  with  long-term  productivity  improvement \nmeasures will be a challenge as it will require speedy design and implementation of investment \nprojects  by  a  multitude  of  Government  agencies  whose  capacity  is  limited.  The  Government \nrecognizes  the  challenge  and  has  initiated  actions  to  accelerate  implementation  of  ongoing \nprojects aimed at production improvement and livelihood development. The Government has also \nattached priority to the pipeline projects of its bilateral and multilateral development partners that \nwill target rural development and poverty reduction.  \n \n76.  The  success  of  the  Project  relies  on  effective  community  mobilization  in  the  proper \nidentification and selection of target groups. The Project will mobilize local NGOs to supervise and \nmonitor  target-group  selection  and  distribute  food  and  inputs.  Due  to  the  large  volume  of \nemergency food to be distributed, there are potential risks in the areas of storage and distribution. \nEnhancement of public sector food storage capacity is now a priority for the Government, and it \nhas taken steps to establish emergency food warehouses in strategic locations. The Government \nis currently working with the rice millers association and Green Trade to use their storage facilities. \nThe Project procurement system will include delivery to commune distribution points. Commune \ncouncil buildings and facilities will be used for temporary storage prior to distribution to villages. \n \nVI.  STAKEHOLDER PARTICIPATION AND CONSULTATION DURING \nIMPLEMENTATION \n77.  The Government has set up the NFSTF with membership drawn from relevant agencies \nincluding MEF, MAFF, Ministry of Interior, MRD, Ministry of Planning, MOWRAM, NCDM, the \nNational Institute of Statistics and the Supreme National Council to assist in, among other things, \nthe implementation of the Project, and provide feedback and advice, as appropriate, during Project \nimplementation. Senior officials of concerned ministries have been designated members of the \nNFSTF, which is supported by technical experts. The task force is chaired by MEF and will meet as \noften as necessary, with participation of the Project implementation team. All stakeholders will be \ndirectly involved in key decisions, especially the selection of target groups, assistance package, \npolicy  reform,  institutional  strengthening,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation.  Beyond  formal \nconsultation forums, such as NFSTF and PCDM meetings, community discussion, debate, and \nconflict resolution will be encouraged through informal local committees. \n \nVII.  ASSURANCES  \n78.  In addition to the standard assurances of the financing agreement, the Government has \ngiven the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:   \n ", "24   \n \n \n(i)  The Government will ensure that the target beneficiaries under Components 1 and 2 \nare selected in strict compliance with the screening and selection criteria agreed \nbetween the Government and ADB. \n(ii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  an  independent  monitoring  system  will  be \nestablished to monitor selection and distribution activities under Components 1 and \n2,  and  independent  NGO  monitors  will  be  recruited  for  this  by  ADB,  and  the \nmonitors will report to ADB and the NFSTF.  \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that the type of work that will be offered to the targeted \ngroup under the food-for-work program will be decided in participation with the \naffected  communities.  The  work  so  identified  will  not  have  any  adverse \nenvironmental  impact  and  will  be  carried  out  on  vacant  land  owned  by  the \nGovernment, free from all encumbrances, habitation, dispute or controversy; and \nproposals  for  civil  works  will  include  confirmation  that  no  land  acquisition  or \nresettlement will be required under the Project. In the event of unforeseen land \nacquisition or involuntary resettlement, the Government will immediately inform ADB \nand  prepare  the  necessary  planning  documents  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995).

Background \n \n1.  Since 2001, Cambodia has experienced double-digit or near double-digit growth of its \ngross domestic product (GDP). The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects 9.1% growth for \n2007,  7.9%  growth  for  2008,  and  7.5%  annual  growth  for  2009\u20132012.1  The  construction, \ngarments, and tourism sectors have contributed most to GDP growth. Rapid economic growth \nhas led to a significant reduction in the poverty rate over the decade of 1993/94\u2013 2004.2 \n \n2.  Cambodia has a total land area of 181,035 square kilometers. The country consists of \n20  provinces,  three  cities,  and  one  municipality,  and  is  divided  into  184  districts,  1,621 \ncommunes, and 13,707 villages. Of the total land area, 67% (12.1 million hectares [ha]) is \nclassified as forest area; the cultivated area is 21% (3.78 million ha), with 91.2% of this devoted \nto  paddy  cultivation.  The  main  crops  are  paddy  (wet  season,  dry  season,  receding,  and \nfloating),  corn,  soybean,  mung  bean,  cassava,  sugarcane,  peanut,  sesame,  sweet  potato, \nChinese cabbage, cauliflower, lettuce, watermelon, and tobacco. Plantation and industrial crops \ninclude rubber, cashew nut, pepper, palm sugar, palm oil, and fruit (mango, pineapple, jackfruit, \ndurian, rambutan, and banana). Forest products include teak wood and acacia (timber), and \nnontimber forest products such as bamboo, grass, fodder, honey, mushrooms, and firewood. \nFish production (freshwater, community, and ricefield production, aquaculture, and marine) in \n2004 was 321,000 tons (t). The share of agriculture, fisheries, and forestry in the total economy \ndeclined from close to half (46%) in 1993 to under a third (30%) in 2006. Within agriculture, the \nshare of the crop sector increased from about 40% of total GDP to about 50%. Correspondingly, \nthe share of the noncrop sectors declined from about 60% of total GDP to 50%. This is contrary \nto the expectation that, over time, the contribution of the non-crops subsector to the growth of \nthe agriculture sector and the overall economy will rise. The share of agriculture, fisheries, and \nforestry in total employment declined from 70% in 2001 to 57% in 2006.3 \n \n3.  The importance of the agriculture and natural resources sector to poverty reduction and \nfood security and the need for a holistic approach to rural development are highlighted by the \ncurrent global food price crisis, which is straining resources and public order in many developing \ncountries.  Underinvestment  in  agriculture,  degradation  of  the  natural  resource  base, \nmisallocation of land, declining food stocks, and lack of exchange entitlement of the poor, have \ncombined with a host of cyclical and long-term factors affecting supply and demand and prices \nto put the lives of millions in jeopardy. Within the above context, the situation confronting \nCambodia merits close scrutiny. Paddy rice production increased from 3.5 million t in 1996 to \nabout 6.7 million t in 2007; the milled rice surplus was estimated at 1.6 million t in 2007.4 Much \nof the marketed surplus finds its way out across the border to Viet Nam unprocessed. This \nsurplus, though, does not mean absence of hunger, as it is pervasive among vulnerable groups \nduring the wet season.

The vulnerability of Cambodia arises not only \nfrom exports and pockets of hunger but also from the fact that the Government does not have \nan emergency procurement system or strategic reserve to deal with potential food crisis. It has \nvery little private and public storage and processing capacity in the country, which aggravates \nthe situation. \n \nB.  Issues \n \n4.  The slow pace of rural development has resulted in the declining capacity of agriculture \nto support the growing population and absorb the additional labor force. Agricultural growth has \nlagged behind GDP growth and has shown wide yearly variations. The Government has made \nattempts to move away from a rice-based agricultural economy by promoting diversification \ntogether with the expansion of non-farm rural activities. These initiatives did not receive the \nnecessary resource, policy, and institutional support, with the result that low rural incomes \npersist and income inequality has increased. Low incomes and increasing inequality have led to \nthe high incidence of rural poverty (37%). As IMF puts it, despite robust economic growth in the \npast several years, rural poverty in Cambodia has remained stubbornly high. That is not all. \nFood insecurity affects about a fifth to a third of rural households, and persists even during \ncropping seasons. With a low level of commercial and industrial development, the pressure is \nheavier on the natural resources sector to provide additional means of subsistence to the \npoverty stricken farmers and landless population.  \n \n5.  Factors that hinder growth in agriculture are (i) low factor productivity; (ii) bio-insecurity; \n(iii) lack of access to information and communication technology (ICT); (iii) lack of market \naccess for products, inputs, services, and alternative employment and livelihood; (iv) poor risk \nmanagement to hedge against uncertainties and fluctuations; (v) policy inadequacies and slow \nimplementation of the reform process; and (vi) weak governance and institutions and lack of \nparticipation. Each of these can be traced back to a set causes. Low productivity is caused by \npoor resource management, lack or inadequate access to resources, lack of education and \nskills, poor health and nutrition, weak extension and research, and lack of social and physical \ninfrastructure. Bio-insecurity emanates from loss of biodiversity, threat to food safety, and loss \nof  environmental  sustainability.  Access  to  ICT  is  constrained  by  low  investment,  lack  of \nhardware and software, lack of ICT skills and training, lack of markets, and lack of power and \nconnectivity. Lack of market access is due to the low level of comparative and competitive \nadvantage and the low level of regional integration, market fragmentation, and inadequate \ninfrastructure,  asymmetry  of  information,  and  slow  private  sector  development.  Poor  risk \nmanagement is caused by lack of capacity to analyze and manage risks and low resilience to \nnatural disasters. Policy inadequacies are manifested in the absence of supporting legislation, \nweak capacity to implement new laws, lack of incentives for improved resource management, \nand inadequate budget allocation for infrastructure and public works. Weak governance and \ninstitutions are linked to lack of appropriate institutions; weak structure and organization; poor \nmanagement and leadership; a weak financial sector; weak civil society and community-based \norganizations; and overlap, duplication, and poor agency and sector coordination. \n                                                 \n5  According to the Economic Institute of Cambodia (available: http://www.eicambodia.org/), as of 5 May 2008 the rice \nprice had increased by 100% to KR3,150/kilogram (kg) in a year; fish and meat prices had increased by 30%\u201360%. \nField investigation by an Asian Development Bank (ADB) fact-finding mission revealed that over the past year the \nprice of average-quality rice had increased by: 163% in Odor Meanchey, 164% in Banteay Meanchey, 103% in \nBattambang, 45% in Kampong Chhnang, 113% in Kampong Thom, 63% in Pursat, and 105% in Siem Reap \nprovince, with the seven-province average rise being 113%.   \n ", "  Appendix 2          31   \nC.  Government Strategy \n \n6.  During  the  past  decade,  the  Government  articulated  a  number  of  strategies  and \nprograms aimed at promoting socioeconomic development and poverty reduction6.In 2004, \nPrime  Minister  Samdech  Hun  Sen  presented  The  Rectangular  Strategy  for  Growth, \nEmployment, Equity and Efficiency at the Third Legislature of the National Assembly. The \nstrategy stressed that the role of agricultural policy is \u201cto improve agricultural productivity and \ndiversification, thereby enabling the agriculture sector to serve as the dynamic driving force for \neconomic growth and poverty reduction\u201d.  \n \n7.  In addition, the Technical Working Group on Agriculture and Water (TWGAW) of the \nMinistry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) and the Ministry of Water Resources and \nMeteorology (MOWRAM) formulated the Strategy for Agriculture and Water, 2006\u20132010,7 as \nrequired by the Second Socioeconomic Development Plan, together with five subsector action \nprograms, including one on food security. The Working Group on Food Security and Nutrition \nprepared Cambodia\u2019s National Strategic Framework for Food Security and Nutrition (SFFSN)8, \n2008\u20132012.  The  stated  goal  of  the  framework  is  that  by  2012,  poor  and  food-insecure \nCambodians will have substantially improved physical and economic access to sufficient, safe, \nand nutritious food, at all times, to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active \nand healthy life. This is to be achieved through increased food production and employment \ncreation, better natural resource management, improved food use and utilization, enhanced \ncapacity to cope with food shocks, and policy and institutional reform. However, Cambodia\u2019s \nefforts to maintain SFFSN\u2019s goal and objectives are being challenged by escalating prices of \nfood, high prices of crop inputs, and budgetary stress. \n \nD.  ADB Strategy \n \n8.  By the end of 2007, Cambodia had received $945 million for 42 loans, $104 million in \nnine grant projects, and $94 million for 144 technical assistance projects. In the agriculture and \nnatural resources sector, Cambodia had received $184 million for nine loans, $30 million in two \ngrant projects, and $18 million for 26 technical assistance projects. The (Asian Development \nBank's) ADB\u2019s operations in Cambodia are guided by a three-pronged strategy: (i) policy and \ninstitutional  reform  including  governance  reform  (program  loans,  technical  assistance  [TA] \ngrants, and contribution to the Financial Sector Blueprint 2001\u20132010); (ii) rehabilitation and \nconstruction  of  physical  and  social  infrastructure  (rural  roads,  irrigation,  water  supply  and \nsanitation, and commune council buildings and others); and (iii) natural resource management \n(projects and TA under the Tonle Sap Initiative). Policy and institutional reforms are an ongoing \nprocess to which ADB\u2019s contribution has been substantial, especially in agricultural policies, \nresearch, and financial sector reform. ADB-financed rural roads have strengthened market \nlinkages and improved mobility; irrigation schemes are providing water for irrigation, thereby \nincreasing agricultural production and reducing poverty; water supply and sanitation works have \ncontributed  to  better  health;  while  the  recently  completed  commune  council  buildings  will \n                                                 \n6 These are (i) National Program to Rehabilitate and Develop Cambodia, 1994\u20131995; (ii) First Socioeconomic \nDevelopment  Plan,  1996\u20132000;  (iii)  Long-Term  Triangle  Strategy,  2001\u20132015;  (iv)  Second  Socioeconomic \nDevelopment Plan, 2001\u20132005; (iv) National Poverty Reduction Strategy, 2003\u20132005 promulgated in December \n2002; and (v) National Strategic Development Plan, 2006\u20132010. \n7 Technical  Working  Group  on  Agriculture  and  Water.  2008.

Finally, the Tonle Sap Initiative, with projects \nand TA, provides the blueprint for protecting the Tonle Sap environment and resources, hence \nprotecting the livelihood of communities in six provinces surrounding the lake. Notwithstanding \nthese accomplishments, ADB operations in the agriculture and natural resources and other \nsectors suffer from lack of synergy, which limits realization of the multiplier effect. \n \n9.  ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for 2005\u201320099 has three components: (i) fostering \nbroad-based private sector-led economic growth, (ii) pursuing inclusive social development, and \n(iii)  strengthening  governance  for  development.  The  country  operations  business  plan  for \nCambodia for 2008\u2013201010 seeks to realign the focus on agriculture and rural development, \nprivate sector development, and risk management through governance reform. In agriculture, \nthe focus will shift to rural transport, rural credit, skills development, other infrastructure, rural \nelectrification,  and  service  delivery.  In  terms  of  country  programming,  major  elements  of \nsequential interventions are being conceived in (i) emergency assistance in response to the \nglobal food price rise, (ii) rural development, (iii) rural energy, (iv) non-farm activities, (v) rural \ncredit, (vi) private sector development, and (vii) governance and capacity building. Under the \ncurrent country strategy and program sector outcomes are (i) increased agricultural production \nthrough  increasing  agricultural  land  under  irrigation  and  rice  yield,  (ii)  improved  market \nenvironment for private agro-based enterprise growth, (iii) effective decentralized rural service \ndelivery,  (iv)  sustainable  management  and  conservation  of  natural  resources,  (v)  reduced \neconomic losses from floods and droughts, (vi) deepening of the Tonle Sap Initiative as an \noperational piloting of such multisector rural poverty reduction, (vi) expansion of the public \nfinancial management reform program for rural development to ensure effective delivery of \nagriculture and rural development and catalyze additional donor support, and (vii) subregional \ninitiatives in new agriculture solutions. \n \n10.  At  its  Annual  Meeting  in  Madrid  in  May  2008,  ADB  announced  a  comprehensive \nstrategic approach to deal with soaring food prices. Within its long-term strategic framework \n2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020)11, ADB outlined short-term responses and medium- to long-term \nresponses to the food price crisis in Soaring Food Prices, Response to the Crisis12. The short-\nterm response will include targeted interventions to protect the food entitlements of the most \nvulnerable groups and income and livelihood programs for the poor. In the medium to long term, \nADB\u2019s assistance to the agriculture and natural resources sector would seek to (i) enhance \nproductivity growth; (ii) promote biosecurity; (iii) improve access to ICT; (iv) improve market \naccess and income diversification; (v) encourage better risk management; (vi) continue the \ndialogue to deepen and widen policy reform; and (vii) strengthen institutions, enhance capacity \nand skills, and promote good governance. Such assistance would be considered in the broader \nframework of agriculture\u2019s links to the rural and wider national economy. \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2004.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nCambodia\u2019s National Strategic Framework for Food Security and Nutrition (SFFSN, 2007\u20132010) aims to provide poor and food-\ninsecure Cambodians with improved physical and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food to meet their dietary \nneeds and preferences. In recent months, soaring food prices, along with fuel and crop input prices, have severely hampered \nthe attainment of Cambodia\u2019s national strategy to increase food supply and capacities of food-insecure households to cope with \nrisks and vulnerabilities to price shocks. The food crisis has further increased food-deprived vulnerable groups from 20% of the \ntotal population to 35%. As of June 2008, it is estimated that 4.5 million people (35%) are living below the food poverty line. The \nproject responds to the Government of Cambodia\u2019s request to provide short-term assistance to reduce vulnerability of food-\ninsecure households through increased access to food and production inputs, and to keep on track with SFFSN targets. This is \nconsistent with the Asian Development Bank's (ADB\u2019s) country strategy and program (2005\u20132009) and Strategy 2020a that \nsupport measures in response to disasters and emergencies such as food crisis to protect the food entitlements of the most \nvulnerable groups and income and livelihood programs of the poor. \n \nB.     Targeting Classification: TI-H      \nThe project will target vulnerable and at-risk categories as follows: (i) landless households (ii) daily casual laborers; (iii) low \nincome; (iv) women-headed households; (v) handicapped, physical, and chronic illnesses, including AIDS and tuberculosis \naffected; (vi) lowest quintile of farmers (the poorest 20% of national population, having less than 1 hectare [ha]); (vii) ethnic \nminority groups; (viii) vulnerable school children; (ix) pregnant and lactating mothers; (x) fixed salary workers and urban poor \nslum dwellers. \n \nC.  Poverty Analysis \nIn May\u2013June 2008, ADB conducted a socioeconomic profile assessment of eight provinces with participation from districts and \ncommunes to identify targeted vulnerable groups. Similarly, Cambodia Development Resource Institute (CDRI, an EU-funded \nproject, is currently undertaking a comprehensive survey on poverty impact of the food crisis in Cambodia to help donors \nidentify appropriate responses and inform their programming assistance. The participatory poverty assessment provides \nstatistical and qualitative information to design measures to address issues relating to efficient and effective delivery of the \nproject to targeted beneficiaries.  \n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nIt was apparent that the poor were the most affected by the rising food prices and accompanying price hikes in fuel and crop \ninputs. The coping mechanisms included reduction in food intake by the poor, and deterioration in the quality of food, negatively \naffecting people's nutritional levels. The temporary suspension of the school feeding program by the World Food Programme in \nMay 2008 was disruptive, signaling uncertainty in food supply, and observed increased absences in school attendance.    \n \nThe main agricultural inputs of fertilizer, quality rice seeds, and capital are also in short supply. Farmers cope by reducing \nfertilizer use and substitute poor-grade rice seeds for high-quality rice seeds, thereby limiting their yield. Some farmers use \norganic fertilizers to supplement or substitute for chemical fertilizers, or do not use fertilizer at all in less favorable land. \nReduction in real wages due to inflation also meant that young female workers in textile factories and the service sector are \nunable to send remittances to their families in the rural areas. The increasing cost of living in urban areas potentially threatens \nopportunities for women\u2019s employment in industrial and service sectors while their families recall them to the rural areas where \nthe cost of living is relatively affordable, and where women provide additional help with farm work during the peak season.  \n \nIn the selected project sites in the Tonle Sap Basin, it is estimated that the loss in households\u2019 purchasing power is $209.9 \nmillion, or 41.4% of the nationwide purchasing burden of $506.5 million. The population of the Tonle Sap Basin is around 30% \nof the national population, which suggests that the Tonle Sap Basin is suffering more seriously than the rest of the country and \nrequires emergency responses from the Government and development partners. \n \n \n ", "50  Appendix 9 \nB.  Consultation and Participation \nThis emergency response project was conceptualized in consultation with the Ministry of Economy and Finance; Ministry of \nAgriculture, Forestry and Fisheries; Ministry of Interior; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports; Ministry of Rural Development; \nNational Committee for Disaster Management; and representatives of donor partners, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), \nand the commercial sector. The Government has demonstrated strong support and ownership of the project. Views of the \nWorld Bank, European Commission, Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (German Agency for Technical \nCooperation), Food and Agriculture Organization, World Food Programme, and the United Nations Development Programme \nwere sought on potential areas for collaboration, procurement strategy, modalities of delivery of ADB\u2019s assistance to ease \nnegative impacts in the short term, and lessons learned were discussed at length.  \n \nThe outputs of the mission were (i) a memorandum of understanding specifying the objectives and scope of the project, \nimplementation arrangements, government assurances, costs and timing; and (ii) an estimate of the investment and financing \nplan. \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues  \nWomen often manage the consumption and nutritional requirements of the household. During the lean and food shortage \nperiod, women tend to favor the needs of other family members, especially children, over their own nutritional and health \nneeds. This has adverse implications for women\u2019s health and the overall food security of the household. The erosion in \npurchasing power of wage workers and the resulting increase in the cost of living in urban areas limit women\u2019s employment \nopportunities as their families living in the rural areas expect them to send remittances. The project will assist the Government \nto make food available to needy households in selected provinces, and create sufficient rice stocks to stabilize the market. The \ntargeted assistance will ensure access of women and children to food and relevant services.  \n \n2.  Key Actions  \nMeasures include equal access by men, women, and children within poor and vulnerable groups. The screening and selection \nprocess will be conducted by commune councils with support from village chiefs. The process will be subject to the supervision \nand monitoring by NGOs and/or community-based organizations acceptable to ADB. The intuitive wealth ranking approach will \nbe used to identify Project beneficiaries. Furthermore, a specific number of women-headed households will be targeted in the \ndevelopment of the project framework. The commune councils will provide the mechanism to addresses any grievances \nregarding access to project benefits at the ground level. Women represented at commune and village councils will participate \nactively in the decision-making processes for food and production input support, and employment creation under the food-for-\nwork program, in order to ensure equal participation of women.   \n \nActivities under the food-for-work program will encompass rehabilitation of small tertiary irrigation canals and village roads, which \nwill mainly involve manual dredging, resurfacing, cutting grass, and filling up road holes within the existing right-of-way. The \nrehabilitation of small tertiary irrigation canals will help optimize the project assistance by completing the essential package of \nwater\u2013seed\u2013fertilizer that will contribute to the productivity enhancement for coming crop seasons. The rehabilitation of village \nroads will help enhance connectivity among villages and communes, ensuring better access to markets and social services. \nThe program will comply with national labor laws and regulations, particularly on child labor, and provide equal pay for equal \nwork regardless of gender and ethnicity. \n \n \nIII.
