The Asian Development Bank (ADB) launched the Central Asia Regional Economic \nCooperation (CAREC) Program in 1997 to help participating countries overcome barriers to \ntrade and other impediments to development, and thereby create new economic opportunities \nand reduce poverty. There are now eight countries in the program: Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. \nADB is the program secretariat.1  \n \n2.  At the Fifth Ministerial Conference on CAREC (5th MC) in October 2006, the CAREC \nministers  endorsed  a  comprehensive  action  plan  for  the  program2 based  on  four  pillars: \nknowledge  and  capacity  building;  regional  infrastructure  networks;  trade,  investment,  and \nbusiness development; and regional public goods.3 The action plan will broaden and deepen the \nprogram by including new policy and sectoral areas of activity, while focusing on the priority \nsectors of transport, energy, trade facilitation, and trade policy, and by giving greater attention to \nthe policy dimension of regional cooperation.4 To underscore the priority accorded to knowledge \nand capacity building, the 5th MC also endorsed the establishment of a CAREC Institute to \ncoordinate CAREC initiatives in research, dialogue, and capacity development. \n \n3.  The knowledge and capacity-building pillar of the action plan will combine the research \nand analysis strengths of participating countries and multilateral organizations to improve the \ncapacity to design and implement mutually beneficial regional initiatives. A network of research \ninstitutes and specialized experts will be created in the region, in partnership with international \nexperts. These experts will engage key government officials, representatives of the business \ncommunity and civil society, and other stakeholders. Finally, mid-level and senior officials in \nCAREC countries will be trained for effective regional cooperation.5 In its CAREC regional \ncooperation strategy and program, ADB recognized the need to increase technical assistance \nfor capacity development in participating countries.6 ADB\u2019s regional cooperation and integration \nstrategy also highlights the role of capacity development in intensifying cooperation.7 As a \nparticipant in both the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) program and the CAREC program, the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has urged the use of a modified form of the GMS Phnom \nPenh Plan (PPP)8 in the CAREC program. At the 5th MC, the PRC suggested that ADB use \n$500,000 from the PRC Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction Fund for this purpose. \nThis regional technical assistance (RETA) will put this generous support into operation. The \nRETA design and monitoring framework is shown in Appendix 1.9 \n \n \n                                                 \n1  The countries in the program work in partnership with six multilateral institutions\u2014ADB, European Bank for \nReconstruction  and  Development,  International  Monetary  Fund,  Islamic  Development  Bank,  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme, and World Bank. \n2  Fifth Ministerial Conference on CAREC. 2006.

ISSUES \n4.  Capacity development must be viewed in the wider context of transition in Central Asia \nand  neighboring  countries,  particularly  following  the  breakup  of  the  Soviet  Union  and  the \nformation of new nation-states. The loss of the central apparatus of the Soviet Union led to \nsevere  economic  difficulties  immediately  after  the  Soviet  years.  But  it  also  opened  up \nopportunities to revive the historic trade routes of Central Asia, to supply world markets with the \nrich energy resources of the region, and to link the region with the rest of the world through \ndynamic trade and communication. The CAREC countries must cooperate toward a common \nfuture to make the most of these opportunities. \n \n5.  CAREC countries differ in geographic, social, economic, and political characteristics, \nand in natural resource endowments. Kazakhstan has the largest land surface and the lowest \npopulation density, and generates about half of regional gross domestic product. In contrast, \nKyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan have small land areas, limited natural resources, and low per \ncapita incomes. Features and challenges common to these countries include poor access to \nmarkets, environmental challenges, vulnerability to natural disasters, low-quality social services, \nand difficult governance conditions.   \n \n6.  While other regional cooperation efforts have had a positive impact on the development \nof institutions, Central Asian and neighboring countries still lack human resources, especially \nthose needed to promote policies and management practices for more open, stable, market-led \neconomies. The shortage of skilled personnel has become critical as a result of migration \nimmediately after the Soviet period. With their civil services poorly resourced and insufficiently \ntrained, the countries are ill equipped to combat poverty, and to build more stable societies that \ncan  promote,  and  benefit  from,  economic  growth  and  sustainable  development.  Human \nresource development must therefore be a core concern of any regional cooperation effort.    \n \n7.  Regional integration efforts in Central Asia and neighboring countries will have a better \nchance  of  success  insofar  as  capacity  development  can  promote  dialogue  among  major \nstakeholders toward greater stability and prosperity in the region. These stakeholders include \nthe  private  sector,  academe,  emerging  media  and  civil  society  organizations,  the  donor \ncommunity, and government agencies. Continuing dialogue toward a shared regional vision is a \nvital part of the proposed capacity development program. \n \n8.  Strong state capacity for regional cooperation in Central Asia and neighboring countries \ncan be supported by developing a core group of reform agents among mid-level and senior \ngovernment officials in each country who have the analytical and negotiating skills to formulate \nand implement mutually beneficial regional initiatives. The challenge is to create a critical mass \nof civil servants with a regional perspective who can translate their knowledge and skills into \nconcrete programs and activities for regional cooperation. The proposed capacity development \nprogram  will  provide  selected  mid-level  and  senior  government  officials  with  learning \nexperiences that will strengthen the capacity of these officials and their institutions to plan, direct, \nmanage, implement, and evaluate programs, plans, and activities for national development and \nregional cooperation. \n \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The capacity development program for  CAREC will  make regional cooperation and \nintegration more effective and give it greater momentum. The program will (i) train senior and \nmid-level government officials involved in regional cooperation in the skills needed to identify, \nplan, and effectively implement mutually beneficial initiatives; and (ii) deepen understanding of \nthe importance of regional cooperation and the costs of noncooperation. Earlier TA completion \nreports cited consensus building and mutual understanding among participating countries as \nvital in overcoming inertia in regional cooperation.10    \n \n10.  In  the  short  term,  the  capacity  development  program  will  create  a  core  group  of \ngovernment  officials  who  can  (i)  advise  their  respective  cabinets  on  regional  cooperation \nmatters, and (ii) effectively and efficiently carry out agreements with neighboring countries. The \nprogram is expected to help build a network of officials skilled in regional cooperation and able \nto help lead dialogue with their governments, the business community, and civil society.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  Under the RETA, all components of the program will be designed and implemented in \nclose  consultation  with  CAREC\u2019s  national  focal  point  (NFP)  in  each  country,  and  with \nuniversities, training centers, and research institutes in the region. \n \n12.  The  RETA  will  (i)  implement  selected  courses  in  strategic  management  and \norganizational  change,  public  policy  analysis  and  public  administration,  global  economic \ncompetition, public-private partnerships in development, and key success factors in regional \ncooperation, among others; (ii) introduce on-site courses in the CAREC region and identify \npartner training institutions that can implement selected courses; (iii) through a small grants \ncomponent, support (a) research on regional cooperation and integration issues by developing \nmember-country experts, and (b) existing research institutes and networks within the region; \nand (iv) in consultation with a range of key stakeholders, develop a detailed proposal for \nestablishing the CAREC Institute to lead the research, dialogue, and capacity development \ninitiatives of the CAREC program. The implementation of the RETA, especially the design and \nexecution of the training and research programs, will be based on a training needs analysis and \nlearning indicators to be prepared by the program manager at the start of the RETA. Moreover, \nthe RETA will build on the lessons and extensive experience of other subregional cooperation \nprograms, such as the GMS Program and PPP for capacity development. In the design and \nconduct  of  training  programs  and  workshops,  synergies  with  the  PPP  and  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank Institute will be explored.11 \n \n13.  A  structured  series  of  short  and  medium-length  courses12 will  be  developed  and \nimplemented in the first 18 months to jump-start the capacity development program and lay the \n                                                 \n10\n ADB. 2003.

Technical  Assistance  Completion  Report  on  Regional  Economic \nCooperation in Central Asia, Phase II Year Two. Manila (TA 5942-REG). \n11 The RETA will also explore opportunities for cooperation with the research and training institutes of other \nmultilateral institutions, such as the World Bank Institute, including the possibility of cofinancing training events.  \n12 A variety of courses are envisioned including workshop-style events of 1\u20133 days on special topics of particular \nrelevance (i.e., negotiation, public-private partnership in regional projects, organizational change) and broader \nevents of up to 2\u20133 weeks covering topics such as strategic management and policy analysis.  \n ", " 4 \nfoundations for longer-term activities in support of regional cooperation. Courses will deepen \nknowledge and skills in development management and public policy. They will also allow the \nparticipants to work together on common issues from a regional perspective. Such learning \nexperiences are expected to help promote a regional approach to problem solving and facilitate \nconsensus building. Course materials will be posted on the ADB Web site. \n \n14.  Specific learning programs are envisioned for the CAREC NFPs,13 who anchor the \nregional effort and must sustain its momentum.  \n15.  In conjunction with the start-up courses, the relevant knowledge and skills needs of \nsenior and mid-level government officials will be assessed. Appropriate institutions with the \nrequisite  expertise  and  translation  facilities  to  conduct  developed  courses  in  appropriate \nlanguages will also be identified and, together with the proposed faculty, will be included in a \nnetwork of capacity-building providers. \n16.  A  competitive  research  grants  component  will  be  developed  and  implemented  to \npromote research by experts from CAREC countries on regional cooperation. (See Appendix 2 \nfor an outline of the anticipated administrative procedures.) In addition, a few small grants not \nexceeding a total of $40,000 in any given year, may also be negotiated directly with selected \nresearch institutes to build local capacity for policy analysis.  \n  \n17.   This RETA will not cover the establishment of the CAREC Institute, but it will provide \nsupport for the development of a detailed program and budget proposal for the establishment of \nthe institute as a center of excellence for the region, for consideration by CAREC. The proposal \nwill learn from and build on all relevant activities and studies done under the RETA, as well as \nconsultations with a broad range of stakeholders. In addition, the proposal will present options \nfor the structure, management, and medium-term work program of the institute in its three core \nareas of (i) research and analysis in regional cooperation and development of research and \nanalysis networks in the region, (ii) dialogue to build understanding and interest in regional \ncooperation, and (iii) capacity development to create a pool of qualified and competent mid-level \nand senior officials to promote and manage regional cooperation initiatives in Central Asia. (See \nAppendix 2 for a diagram of the proposed input flow.) Until more resources can be mobilized, \nthe  institute  is  expected  to  be  run  on  a  small  scale,  with  the  use  of  information  and \ncommunication technologies (Internet, Web sites, video conferencing) to cut costs.14 \n   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $990,000. ADB will finance $490,000 of this \namount from its TA funding program and will administer the balance of $500,000, to be provided \nby the Government of the PRC. Detailed cost estimates are given in Appendix 3.   \n \n                                                 \n13 Each CAREC country has an NFP, whose key role is to ensure effective coordination (i) among concerned \ngovernment agencies and other interested parties in matters related to regional economic cooperation, and \n(ii) between the government and the CAREC secretariat. In particular, NFPs are involved in and help coordinate \nactivities of the Senior Officials\u2019 Meeting, all sector coordinating committees, and project-specific working groups in \nwhich the country is involved. Given the pivotal role of the NFP, this function is usually given to a senior \nrepresentative of the government agency in charge of overall planning, such as the ministry of finance or of the \neconomy, or the state planning agency. To ensure continuity and consistency in the work of the NFP, countries are \nencouraged to ensure some permanence to these appointments.  \n14 The Institute may begin small-scale operations with seed financing from ADB, but it is hoped governments within \nand outside the CAREC region, as well as other multilateral and bilateral development partners, would consider \nproviding support in the future. \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.   ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department (CWRD) will be the Executing Agency of the \nRETA and will be responsible for overall RETA administration. A program manager will report to \nCWRD. The RETA is expected to begin in January 2007 and be completed by June 2008. \n \n20.   A steering committee chaired by the director of the Country Coordination and Regional \nCooperation Division, CWRD, will oversee the RETA. The committee members will be the \nnational focal points (NFPs) and the program manager. The committee will screen programs \nand identify partner institutions, and will meet periodically to review progress and resolve issues. \nA full-time program secretariat initially based at ADB headquarters will provide logistical and \nadministrative support.  \n \n21.   The RETA will require consulting services, as follows: a program manager (international, \n8 person-months), a full-time program officer (national, 18 person-months), and an institutional \ndevelopment specialist (international, 1.5 person-months). (See Appendix 4 for the terms of \nreference for these consultants.) In addition, several short-term consultants (international and \nnational) will be required for course development and implementation in all countries and for \nshort-term research. all the consultants will be engaged by ADB according to its Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (April 2006, as amended from time to time). Office equipment will be \nprocured for this RETA according to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April 2006, as amended \nfrom time to time). After the RETA, all equipment will be retained by the CAREC unit and used \nin other capacity development program activities. \n \n22.  Appropriate  information  on  RETA  activities,  including  relevant  course  and  training \nprogram materials and outputs from the small research grant program, will be disseminated \nwidely through ADB\u2019s CAREC Web site and the quarterly CAREC newsletter. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, and (ii) ADB \nproviding the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $490,000 on a grant basis for Central \nAsia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation:  Capacity  Development  for  Regional  Cooperation  in \nCAREC Participating Countries, Phase I, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", " \n6\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK    \n \n \n    \n \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions     \n \n \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks    A\np\nImpact        p\ne\nGreater regional cooperation  In transport by 2010, harmonization of  -  CAREC sector coordinating  Assumption: CAREC governments  n\nd\namong Central Asia Regional  cross-border procedures,  committee reports  cooperate.   ix\n 1\nEconomic Cooperation (CAREC)  documentation, and transport  -  Senior Officials\u2019 Reports     \nprogram countries in transport,  regulations.   -  Ministerial Conference statements  Risk: Regional cooperation does not remain \nenergy, and trade  In energy by 2010; construction of two  a priority of participating governments. \n  multi-country high-voltage \ntransmission lines.  \nIn trade by 2010; customs automation \nsystems and risk management \npractices adopted; and joint customs \ncontrol pilot tested \n \nOutcome        \nSenior and mid-level officials in  At least one regional project in each  -  Summary of Proceedings of Senior  Assumptions: Participating officials and \nCAREC participating countries use  sector (transport, energy, trade)  Officials\u2019 Meetings  governments remain committed to regional \nacquired knowledge and skills to  assessed and considered at Ministerial  -  Reports of Senior Officials to  cooperation.  \nassess and support regional  level by end 2008  Ministerial Conferences   \ncooperation initiatives in transport,    -  Ministerial Conference statements \nenergy, and trade     \n   \nOutputs       \n1.
