During  the  2004  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) confirmed its request for technical assistance (TA) from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to help the government of Shanxi Province (GSP) develop its waste \ncoal utilization strategy, with a focus on specific investment planning.1 In July 2004, the Fact-\nFinding Mission was fielded to assess the results of available studies and determine the scope \nof  the  TA.  The  Mission  held  discussions  with  Government  and  GSP  representatives.  An \nunderstanding was reached on the TA  goals, purpose, scope, cost  estimates, financing and \nimplementation arrangements, and  consultants\u2019 terms of reference. The TA framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The PRC is the world\u2019s largest coal producer and consumer. In 2003 the PRC produced \nabout 1,670 million tons (t) of raw coal, about 28% of the world\u2019s total. Coal accounts for 95% of \nthe nation\u2019s primary  fossil energy resources and provides more than 75% of the energy for \npower generation, 65% of chemical raw materials, and more than 50% of commercial and \ncivilian energy. Coal will continue to be the country\u2019s primary energy source. Shanxi accounts \nfor about one third of the PRC\u2019s coal production, or 480  million t in 2003. The cost of coal \nproduction is low, at about $12 to $13 equivalent per ton for large coal mines. However, coal is \nexpensive to transport and is used inefficiently.  \n \n3.  Waste coal is a solid produced during coal mining and preparation. Waste coal has a \nvery low carbon content, which makes transporting it for use as fuel extremely inefficient. It \nusually accounts for 8\u201310% of total coal production.  The PRC has about 1,500 waste coal \nheaps, with total waste coal amounting to about 3.6 billion t, occupying 15,000 hectares (ha), \nand increasing by 2,400 ha annually. Shanxi has about 300 waste coal heaps, with waste coal \namounting to about 1 billion t, occupying 4,500 ha. In 2003, the PRC produced 167 million t of \nwaste coal, 70 million t of it in Shanxi, where it is a major environmental problem. \n \n4.  The  combustible  matter  in  waste  coal  spontaneously  combusts  under  certain \nconditions,2 emitting harmful  elements such as sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, and discharge \nparticulate matter (smoke and dust), and seriously affecting people\u2019s health. After rainfall and \nwater flushing, harmful elements of waste coal, especially heavy metal ions, are dissolved in \nwater,  leading  to  water  pollution.  Waste  coal  heaps  could  destroy  the  landscape  and \nenvironment and cause water and soil degradation. The random piling of waste coal in rivers \ncould hamper flood control and lead to disaster. \n \n5.  To ease the energy shortage, the Government has formulated a two-pronged strategy of \naccelerating the addition of new capacities and promoting energy conservation. Environmental \nprotection is also receiving increased awareness and attention.  The average heat value of \nwaste coal is about 1,300 kilocalories per kilogram (kCal/kg), while the heat value of raw coal is \nabout 5,000 kCal/kg. The storage of 3.60 billion t of waste coal, if fully used, will replace \n0.94 billion  t  of  coal,  and,  if  utilized  for  electricity  production,  could  generate  about \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 7 February 2004. \n2  By the end of 1999, the PRC had 79 waste coal heaps undergoing spontaneous combustion, causing serious air \npollution in mining areas. ", "2 \n \n2,100 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, higher than the 2003 power generation of 1,898 TWh. \nTherefore, waste coal utilization is an important part of energy conservation. \n \n6.  Some waste coal utilization programs have been developed. Options include (i)  low \nheating  value  fuel  for  power  and  heat  generation  through  fluidized  bed  combustion,  and \nbriquette production with coal slime; (ii) raw material to produce cement, bricks and blocks, and \nlight aggregate material; (iii)  filling material for surface subsided areas and for  the base of \nhighways and railways; (iv)  raw material  to make  chemical products; (v)  secondary mineral \nresources; and (vi) producing composite fertilizer and providing trace elements for crops. Waste \ncoal is mainly used for fuel, filling material, and building material. \n \n7.  The PRC has a series of policies and regulations to encourage waste coal utilization.3 \nThese mainly promote the use of waste coal for power generation. By the end of 2003, Shanxi \nhad established  37 waste coal power plants, with a total capacity of  427 megawatts (MW), \nconsuming about 2 million t of waste coal. The capacity of single generating unit is small, and \nthe largest one was 50 MW.4 The GSP has actively promoted the use of waste coal to generate \npower and plans to invest in waste coal power projects with a total capacity of 2,600 MW in the \nnext 5 to 10 years. The environmental issues of waste coal power plants can be addressed by \nupdated technology.  Sulfur  oxides  emission  can  be  lessened  by circulated fluidized bed \ncombustion, and  a flue gas desulfurization system, if the sulfur content of the waste coal is \ngreater  than  2%.  Dust  emission  can  be  reduced  by  multiple-tube  cyclone  dedusters  and \nelectrostatic precipitators. The fly ash and slag can be used to produce building material, or to \nreclaim land by filling the surface subsided area. The use of coal heaps as fuel will also \neliminate spontaneous combustion and pollution. \n \n8.  About one third of waste coal is used to produce building material, such as cement, \nbrick, and ceramic tile.5 Shanxi Lu\u2019an Coal Group recently started a waste coal brick production \nline, the largest in the PRC, with a capacity of 130 million bricks annually, consuming 0.3 million \nt of waste coal. As the demand for ceramic tile increases by about 15%, the potential for using \nwaste coal will be great.6 \n \n9.  Only in recent years has the PRC seriously started taking waste coal utilization into \nconsideration in the development process. During 1997\u20132001, the PRC\u2019s coal market was weak \nand coal mine companies suffered heavy losses, preventing them from investing in waste coal \nutilization. The main focus was to sell coal. The Government also heavily subsidized coalmine \ncompanies. With the improvement of the coal industry since 2002, coalmine companies have \nstarted  waste  coal  utilization.  The  policy  of  restricting  production  of  clay  bricks  has  also \npromoted the use of waste coal as a building material. High coal prices and strong coal demand \nhave increased investment in waste coal utilization projects. Coal companies now include waste \ncoal utilization in their development plans. The Government also promotes waste coal utilization \nby increasing the environmental levy (such as reclamation fee and solid waste discharge fee),7 \n                                                 \n3  These regulations cover  waste coal comprehensive use management methods, technical  policy of  waste coal \ncomprehensive use, and management of resource comprehensive use power plant. \n4  The implementation of the Shanxi Zhaocheng Waste Coal Power Plant started on 18 July 2003, with a capacity of \n100 MW (2 x 50 MW). \n5  Recently, new technology and equipment to produce hollow bricks from waste coal passed the appraisal of the \nState Development and Reform Commission. The technology is estimated to be able to use 16 million t of waste \ncoal annually. \n6  In January 2004, experts from the China University of Geosciences announced a new technology that can use \nwaste coal to produce ceramic title. \n7  A 2003 Government regulation states that if waste coal is not properly treated, a discharge fee of waste coal will be \ncollected at CNY5/t. ", "    3 \n \nand has issued preferential policies to encourage the use of waste coal. The  projects using \nwaste coal enjoy tax benefits, including exemption of value-added tax and reduction of income \ntax. \n \n10.  Waste coal utilization projects are open to private investment. However, private sector \ninvolvement has been limited. Incentives are insufficient as (i) coalmine companies performed \npoorly before 2003 due to low coal prices; (ii) waste coal utilization is still in its infant stage, with \nperceived commercial risks; (iii) technical and institutional uncertainties exist; (iv) many waste \ncoal utilization projects were funded by the Government\u2019s preferential loans aimed at creating \njobs for laid-off miners; and (v) power grid tariff for waste coal power plant was generally low, \naffecting profitability. To encourage private sector participation, an enabling environment needs \nto be created. \n \n11.  The GSP aims to contain worsening environmental pollution and ecosystem degradation \nto demonstrate that rapid economic growth and a clean environment are compatible. ADB's \nPRC operational strategy aims to help the country achieve economic growth in an efficient, \nequitable, and sustainable manner. ADB\u2019s PRC energy sector strategy includes (i) developing \ncleaner energy sources; (ii) renovating and retrofitting existing facilities to improve efficiency, \nand reduce emissions; (iii) promoting the corporatization and commercialization of energy \nutilities;  and  (iv)  promoting  pricing  and  tariff  reforms.  The  energy  sector  strategy  is \ncomplemented  by  ADB's  strategy  for  the  environment  sector,  which  supports  the  use  of \neconomic, supply-side, and other measures to ensure sustainable use of natural resources; \npromotes market-based pricing; and encourages cost recovery and environmental information \ndisclosure. Shanxi suffers the most from waste coal and plans to improve its use by 2020. The \nTA is a major part of this effort. With the joint efforts of the GSP and ADB, Shanxi will try to \nobtain a special support policy from the Government to develop waste coal utilization and \ndemonstration projects in promoting it. The TA, by developing a use strategy and active policy \ndialogue,  is  consistent  with  and  supports  the  GSP\u2019s  development  objectives,  and  is  also \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s energy sector strategy. The largest coal supplier in the PRC, Shanxi will \nbe the pilot province for advancing a national policy on coal waste use and for streamlining a \nseries of administrative guidelines. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n12.  The TA\u2019s objective is to help the GSP mitigate the environmental impact of waste coal \nand conserve energy by assessing waste coal utilization options and developing a waste coal \nutilization strategy and action plan. The TA will also develop a framework for medium- and long-\nterm cooperation between the GSP and ADB for sustainable energy development. \n \n13.  The  TA  will  (i)  examine  key  issues  related  to  waste  coal  utilization  and  propose \nmeasures to address them; (ii) assess impacts of waste coal utilization, including social and \nenvironmental aspects and sustainable economic development; (iii) identify and remove barriers \nto private sector participation in waste coal utilization, and develop a policy and regulatory \nframework  to  facilitate  such  participation;  (iv)  assess  selected  pilot  waste coal utilization \nprojects; (v) conduct an international seminar; (vi) carry out a field study; (vii) develop a waste \ncoal utilization strategy and related investment programs; and (viii)  conduct a  consultation \nworkshop with the main stakeholders. \n ", "4 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n14.  The TA will be implemented in close consultation with all stakeholders and interested \nparties, including targeted consumers and potential private sector investors.  The TA will be \ncarried out in three phases. In phase I, the consultants will do a detailed background study to \nthoroughly understand waste coal utilization issues. During phase II, the consultants will conduct \nan international seminar (para. 15) and identify the main issues to be addressed to (i) achieve the \nTA objectives, (ii) identify options for waste coal utilization, (iii) promote using waste coal for power \ngeneration and other commercial uses, (iv) introduce international best practices that are suitable \nfor the PRC\u2019s power sector, and (v) implement reforms to solve these problems. Under phase III, \nbased on the assessment of waste coal utilization options, the consultants will develop a strategy \nand action plan to support limited waste coal utilization. Based on the strategy,  the TA will \ndevelop a framework for medium- and long-term cooperation between  the GSP and ADB for \nsustainable energy development, and carry out a preliminary assessment for selected waste coal \nutilization pilot projects. The consultants will make assessments from technical, institutional, \neconomic,  social,  financial,  pricing,  environmental,  and  poverty  impact  viewpoints.  The \nconsultants\u2019 recommendations will be discussed in a workshop with the main stakeholders. The \nconsultants will organize a final workshop with the main stakeholders to disseminate the TA \nfindings  and  recommendations.  The  consultants  will  also  develop  a  public  dissemination \nstrategy for the TA findings. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 2. \n \n15.  The consultants will organize an international seminar on waste coal utilization in phase \nII. The seminar will introduce and evaluate international experience and its relevance to the \nPRC and incorporate such experience into a waste coal utilization strategy. International and \ndomestic experts will be invited to present papers and participate in the discussions. After the \nseminar, the consultants will prepare a report summarizing the discussions and identifying \nissues relevant to the PRC. The TA includes an international field study to expose selected PRC \npersonnel  to  the  latest  trends  and  international  best  practices  in  waste  coal  utilization. \nPersonnel from the GSP involved in policymaking and implementation of waste coal utilization will \nundertake the 10-day study. The consultants will consider the particular needs of the study \nparticipants and prepare a detailed proposal for ADB approval, specifying the (i) objectives of the \nfield study, (ii) institutions to be visited, (iii) agenda for discussions and training, (iv) name and job \ndescription of each member nominated to participate in the field study, and (v) costs. Selection \nof participants for the international field study will be acceptable to ADB and consider economy \nand efficiency. At the end of the field study, the participants will submit to ADB a report \nsummarizing the findings and recommendations. \n \n16.  The  major  assumptions  for  the  TA\u2019s  successful  implementation  include  adequate \ncounterpart support, adequate and timely provision of data, and submission of required studies. \nMajor  risks  include  delay  in  consultant  selection  and  poor  consultant  performance.  The \nGovernment\u2019s continuing commitment to coal and power sector reforms, promotion of private \nsector participation, coal price and power tariff rationalization, and transparent regulation are \nalso necessary for the TA\u2019s success. Efforts will be made to ensure that competent consultants \nwill be recruited on time. The GSP is committed to reform and agreed to provide  adequate \ncounterpart  support  and  data.  Close  coordination  among  the  consultants,  executing  and \nimplementing agencies, and ADB will further mitigate these risks. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $560,000 equivalent, with a foreign exchange cost of \n$259,750 and a local currency cost of $300,250 equivalent (Appendix 3). ADB will provide ", "    5 \n \n$400,000 equivalent to finance $259,750 of the foreign exchange cost and $140,250 equivalent \nof the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding \nprogram. The GSP will contribute $160,000 equivalent representing about 29% of the TA cost, \nto finance the remaining local currency cost. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The GSP will be the TA Executing Agency. ADB will engage the services of international \nand domestic consultants according to its  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants,  and  in \nconsultation with the GSP.  The international consultant will have expertise in (i) waste coal \nutilization,  (ii)  coal  price  and  power  tariff  regulation,  (iii)  environmental  assessment, \n(iv) economic and financial analysis, (v) institutional analysis, and (vii) poverty impact and social \nassessment.  The  domestic  consultants  will  have  similar  expertise.  An  estimated  total  of \n27 person-months of consulting services will be required: 7 for international and 20 for domestic \nservices. A consulting firm will be selected following the submission of biodata proposals. The \nTA is expected to commence in December 2004 and be completed by December 2005. \n \n19.  The GSP will establish a counterpart team with representatives from the GSP and \nselected pilot projects.8 The counterpart team will closely interact with the consultants during TA \nimplementation.9 The GSP will also establish a steering committee comprising senior GSP \nofficials and representatives from other government organizations and agencies involved in \nformulating and implementing waste coal utilization policies. The steering committee will be the \napex body, convey and interpret the Government\u2019s views on policy issues, and generally \noversee  TA  implementation.  The  counterpart  team  and  steering  committee  members  will \ninteract with each other to clarify matters that fall outside the GSP\u2019s purview. The GSP will \nprovide interpreters, local transportation, and suitably equipped office space in Taiyuan. Some \nof the office equipment will be financed under the TA and will be procured by the international \nconsultants  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  The  consultants  will \nestablish an effective monitoring and evaluation system to monitor the impact of the TA, which \nwill provide the basis for the GSP\u2019s impact monitoring after the completion. The monitoring and \nevaluation system will include specific and measurable targets, and identify key risks and \ninstitutional  arrangement  for  effective  monitoring.  The  consultants  will  also  provide  the \nnecessary  trainings  on  monitoring.  Within  3  to  5  years  after  the  TA  completion  when \ndevelopment impacts should be evident, the GSP will carry out the impact assessment of the \nTA. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Waste Coal Utilization Study, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n8  The pilot projects will be selected in phase I of the TA. \n9  The GSP will appoint the counterpart team before TA negotiations.
