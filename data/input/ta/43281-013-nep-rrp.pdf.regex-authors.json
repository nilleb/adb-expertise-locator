I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto Nepal for the Tanahu Hydropower Project. The report also describes proposed administration \nof  technical  assistance (TA)  to  be  provided  by the  Japan  Fund for  Poverty  Reduction for \nSupport for Sustainable Energy Management and Reforms, and if the Board approves the \nproposed loans, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2.  Nepal faces a mounting energy crisis. Supplies fall well short of demand, the main utility \noperating the system is highly inefficient, the policy environment is weak, and the role of the \nprivate sector is far too small. The supply gap is growing, especially during the dry season in \nwinter (November\u2013April). Kathmandu, the main consumption center, has blackouts of 14\u201318 \nhours a day during this season and load shedding almost every day year-round. Supplies in the \nrest  of  the  country  fare  even  worse,  although  an  additional  problem  here  is  a  very  low \nelectrification rate. In the meantime, demand for electricity has been growing at 10% annually. \nThis supply gap forces consumers to use diesel generators. These are expensive and very \npolluting. Rising diesel imports affect the balance of payments, and the doubling of diesel prices \nover the past 3 years also hurts the income base of people and businesses.1 The supply problem \nis becoming one of the biggest obstacles to economic growth. It curtails investment and trade, \nproductivity, job creation, and the quality of life of most citizens. The proposed project is one of a \nseries of similar investments to help overcome this supply problem. The project has three main \ncomponents: (i) a medium-sized hydropower plant of 140 megawatts (MW) with significant water \nstorage facilities and associated transmission lines to evacuate the generated power; (ii) rural \nelectrification and community development in the project area, and (iii) a reform and restructuring \nplan for the national utility, the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA). The project site is in the Seti \nRiver in the Tanahu district, about 150 kilometers (km) west of Kathmandu. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Supply,  policy,  and  institutional  gaps.  Nepal\u2019s  total  installed  power  generation \ncapacity stands at only 706 MW, the majority of which is owned and operated by NEA while the \nprivate sector owns and runs 158 MW.2 This current total national installed capacity represents \nless than 1.5% of the country\u2019s theoretical hydropower potential. Furthermore, this capacity \nshrinks to 250\u2013300 MW during the dry season, which also happens to be the time when \ndemand is at its highest (over 1,000 MW). About 85% of the current generation is based on run-\nof-river  schemes,  the  vast  majority  of  which  are  badly  affected  by  water-flow  fluctuations, \nespecially in the dry season. Energy supply is low and very irregular. \n \n4.  Inadequate and unreliable supply is a function of low levels of investment in the past, but \nalso of limited maintenance of assets. Strategic, operational, managerial, and financial flaws at \nNEA  aggravate  this  problem,  itself  accentuated  in  large  part  by  a  poor  business  climate, \nincluding a bad tariff regime (tariffs were revised for the first time in 11 years in July 2012).3 A \nvery low tariff has dented NEA\u2019s financial standing and its ability to cover basic operating costs. \n                                                \n1  Diesel imports averaged 300 million liters a year in 2001\u20132007, but increased to 600 million liters by 2010. Diesel \nprices rose from NRs53/liter to NRs97/liter.  \n2  23 independent power producers contribute less than 10 MW each.  \n3  This followed the reconstitution of the Electricity Tariff Fixation Commission (ETFC) in September 2011. ETFC is \nallowed to regulate only retail tariffs besides generation and transmission pricing.    \n ", "2 \nThe company is certainly unable to fund new investments, or to maintain the existing network. \nIts operational and financial performance is rather weak. NEA is inefficient, provides low-quality \nservices, and needs major restructuring.4 The private sector needs to be given more and better \nentry points to invest. Government alone will not be able to resolve the energy crisis. It does not \nhave the financial means and the right people to do so. Further, the \u2015investment problem\u2016 is not \nconfined to low generation capacity. The transmission and distribution networks are also in \nurgent need of expansion and modernization, an expensive undertaking at the best of times. \nOnly 34% of the country\u2019s households are connected to the grid. This is much lower in rural \nareas. The project will help reduce poverty by mitigating the supply and access problems.  \n \n5.  Strategic framework. The government has a reasonably good energy strategy. This \ncalls for increased energy security at home, energy exports, greater energy efficiency, and more \nreliance on clean energy. It also calls for better institutional effectiveness, a more predictable \npolicy environment, and much more private sector involvement. Energy security at home means \nstepping up supplies to both urban and rural areas. Supply to urban areas will be backed by \nlarge power generation projects like Tanahu. In rural areas, the task entails rural electrification \nand the development of renewable energy schemes, including those based on solar and wind \npower\u2014or  a  combination  of the two  (hybrids)\u2014and  small  run-of-the river  projects.  Energy \nexports are also a priority, although the sequencing of these investments has been a serious \nproblem. Some policymakers want the domestic power supply problem to be sorted out first. \nOthers  see  the  need  to  invest  in  the  two  types  of  operations  simultaneously.  The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) agrees with this second approach. Energy export projects are good \nfor the country and the region. They generate much-needed export revenues and create jobs. \nSeveral export-oriented investments have been under review for some time, so far with limited \nsuccess, largely on account of an unpredictable and unbalanced policy regime, and because of \nmixed messages from the government. ADB has suggested investing in at least one flagship \nproject to pave the way, preferably under the auspices of the South Asia Subregional Economic \nCooperation program. Naturally, such an investment must target the Indian market. It will imply \nmajor capital outlays, top quality sponsors, and substantial third-party finance. Attracting serious \ninvestors and financiers requires a robust policy regime. It also requires the right political \nmessages from the government. These two aspects have been missing. In the meantime, ADB \nhas been assisting Nepal with the formulation of this long-term energy strategy. It will also be \nadvising on the definition of key structural reforms and institutional changes. The ADB country \npartnership strategy with Nepal attaches high priority to the sector.5 The government wants ADB \nto do the same under a new strategy now under preparation. \n \n6.  Development partners. ADB is the main player in the energy sector, and will remain so \nfor some time.6 But others are also playing an active role, in particular the Japan International \nCooperation Agency (JICA). The latter is the main partner in the proposed project alongside the \nEuropean Investment Bank (EIB) and the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD). The World \nBank is considering doing more in the sector, most likely with projects in rural areas. Its affiliate, \nthe International Finance Corporation, is much more active and is currently looking at both \ndomestic and export-oriented projects, at least one of which could be funded in partnership with \nADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department. Most bilateral development agencies have a keen \ninterest in the sector, even if they do not actually fund projects themselves. Most are concerned \nwith  access  to  energy,  with  issues  related  to  public  financial  management,  institutional \n                                                \n4  The  government  approved  in  principle  an  NEA  financial  restructuring  plan  in  2012,  but  this  now  requires \nimplementation with concrete detail.  \n5  ADB. 2009.

Some of them do finance projects in the sector\u2014at \nleast they have done so in the recent past. Norway is a case in point.  \n \n7.  Special features. The project meets basic readiness filters, including full engineering \ndesigns,  safeguard  plans,  budget  allocations,  and  advanced  procurement.7 Another  unique \nfeature is the creation of a special-purpose company\u2014Tanahu Hydropower Limited (THL)\u2014to \ndevelop and run the operation once it enters its full commercial phase. This effectively \u2015ring-\nfences\u2016 the entire project from NEA,8 whose capacity is in any case overstretched. NEA will \ninstead provide an offtake to THL. Another strong feature of the transaction is the outsourcing of \nall project supervision and coordination functions to a reputable and experienced international \ncompany. Actual project execution work will be mostly done through fixed-period contracts \n(whenever feasible with fixed prices and with performance bonuses and penalties benchmarked \nagainst budget, timelines, and quality standards). Another special feature is ADB\u2019s facilitation \nrole throughout the procurement process, including bid evaluations, contract negotiations, and \ncontractor payments. At the request of the government and THL, ADB will recruit the project \nsupervision  advisors  and  other  specialist  consultants,  including  those  responsible  for \nsafeguards, the community development program, sector reforms, and NEA restructuring. This \nADB  facilitation  role  will  underpin  time  efficiencies,  strong  competition,  contractor  quality \nstandards, and full transparency. The government and THL personnel will be fully involved and \ntrained  during  this  process.  Two  other  major  features  are  (i) the  provision  of  capacity \ndevelopment TA to bring about much-needed reforms in the sector and the restructuring of \nNEA; and (ii) assistance in a possible sale of either a minority or a majority stake in THL to \nreputable international investors.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact will be expanded access to clean and sustainable energy in Nepal. The \noutcome will be increased efficiency and supply of reliable hydropower energy. \n  \nC.  Outputs \n9.  The outputs will be (i) a 140 MW hydropower plant and related transmission system\u2014\n37 km, 220 kilovolts (kV)\u2014made operational; (ii) rural electrification increased (covering 17,636 \nhouseholds); (iii) community development program in the project area implemented; (iv) NEA \nrestructured;  (v) other  sector  reforms  undertaken;  and  (vi)  an  equity  sale  scheme  for \nhydropower development initiated. The prospective sale of an equity stake in THL will be \nsubject to market conditions and the execution of transactions. These outputs will be supported \nby the project coupled with the TA.9 \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n10.  The project cost is estimated at around $505 million (Table 1). \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2010.

The  government  has  requested  two  loans  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \n(i) $120 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (regular-term loan), and (ii) $30 million \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (hard-term loan). Both loans will have a 32-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period \nand 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan \nand project agreements.10 ADB\u2019s total finance is limited to $150 million.  \n \n12.  The government has also requested cofinancing from ADFD, EIB, and JICA.11 JICA will \nfund all the powerhouse facilities, and do so through parallel cofinancing. ADB, ADFD, and EIB \nwill  jointly  finance  the  civil  works.  ADB  will  fund  on  its  own,  or  in  conjunction  with  the \ngovernment,  the  transmission  lines,  the  community  development  and  rural  electrification \nprograms, and a portion of land acquisition and resettlement costs.12 NEA, THL and/or the \ngovernment will make available all counterpart funds on a timely basis. These will be extended \neither through budgetary allocations and/or other arrangements acceptable to ADB. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nSource  Amount ($ million)  Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank   150  30 \nAsian Development Fund (regular-term loan)  120  24 \nAsian Development Fund (hard-term loan)   30   6 \nAbu Dhabi Fund for Development    30  6 \nEuropean Investment Bank    70  14 \nJapan International Cooperation Agency   184  36 \nGovernment and/or Nepal Electricity Authority   71  14 \n   Total     505      100 \n Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n                                                \n10  The terms and conditions of hard-term and those of regular-term loans in 2013. Both loans will require onlending \nand relending arrangements with the government, NEA, and THL.  \n11  For effective coordination among the cofinanciers, collaborative cofinancing documents will be signed with each of \nthe cofinanciers. ADB, ADFD, and EIB have already negotiated the principles that will govern their collaboration \nand coordination in respect of the jointly financed procurement package. \n12 Land acquisition and resettlement costs will first be funded by the government and then be reimbursed by ADB \nwhen ADB is fully satisfied with the entire processes, including the compensation settlement. These activities will \nbe monitored by selected nongovernment organizations (NGOs). Due diligence on financing of land acquisition and \nresettlement costs has been conducted by experienced experts and is summarized in the project administration \nmanual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n ", "5 \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  THL will be the executing agency for the hydropower plant and all associated works. \nNEA will be the executing agency for the transmission lines and the rural electrification program. \nThe implementation arrangements are described in detail in the project administration manual.13  \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  June 2013\u2013June 2020 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2020 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Steering committee \nSecretary, Ministry of Energy (chair) \nJoint secretary, Ministry of Finance; managing directors, THL and NEA; \ngeneral managers (engineering services, grid development, distribution and \nconsumer services), NEA (members) \n(ii)   Executing agencies  THL and NEA \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  THL and NEA \n(iv)  Implementation unit  THL and NEA project implementation units \nProcurement  International competitive  2 contracts  $156.2 million \nbidding \nNational competitive bidding  1 contract  $0.9 million \nConsulting services  QCBS  2,770 person-months  $23.1 million \nIndividual  555 person-months  $3.9 million \nAdvance contracting  Only for eligible contract packages and eligible expenditures agreed \nbetween ADB and the government. \nDisbursement  The ADB loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and under \nother arrangements agreed between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, NEA = Nepal Electricity Authority, THL = Tanahu Hydropower Limited, QCBS = \nquality- and cost-based selection.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n14.  Procurement. Procurement packages will be split into four parts: part A will cover main \nheadworks; part B will procure equipment and other powerhouse facilities; part C will secure \ntransmission and rural electrification lines; and part D will include project supervision and other \ntechnical expertise. Part B components will be procured by JICA. Parts A and C will follow \ninternational competitive bidding in line with ADB Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time).14 Because of joint cofinancing, procurement under Part A will require a \nwaiver. This is because it involves funding from ADFD and EIB and thus potentially procurement \nfrom non-ADB member countries.15 At the request of the government and THL, consultants \nunder Part D will be recruited directly by ADB under the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).16 The  project\u2019s  construction  period  is  projected  at \n                                                \n13  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14  While  the  bidding  documents,  including  any  prequalification  ones,  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  standard  bidding  and \nprequalification criteria for part A, EIB will be ready to assist THL with the publication of any procurement notice in \nthe Official Journal of the European Union. This may require the executing agency to insert the covenant on \nintegrity attached as an additional document to be submitted by bidders. \n15  As a condition for ADFD and EIB cofinancing, both institutions require that ADB waives its member country \nprocurement eligibility restrictions, such that countries that are eligible sources of procurement under their financed \nprojects are also eligible sources for procurement in respect of this contract package. In view of this, it is proposed \nthat the ADB Board of Directors approve such a waiver. \n16  ADB will select consultants for the relevant consulting services on the government's behalf, but the executing \nagency will negotiate and enter into the agreements pursuant to which the consulting services will be rendered. \n ", "6 \n7 years, which includes about 1.5 years for project site development (building access roads and \na bridge to reach the main construction site)17 and the execution of safeguard plans.  \n \n15.  Supervision. The supervision of the project\u2019s construction phase (7 years), and at least \nthe  first  5  years  of  its  commercial  operations,  needs  help  from  external  experts.  Good \nsupervision is an absolute necessity to ensure that the project is executed on time, on budget, \nand with the right quality standards. There is also a need to ensure that all safeguard plans are \nexecuted properly and on time. ADB will engage the services of specialists to perform this work. \nThe supervision firm will be selected using quality- and cost-based selection procedures set out \nunder ADB guidelines. The selection criteria include proven experience with similar projects, a \n90:10 blend between quality and cost, and the use of in-house staff to manage key tasks. The \nadvisors will have a dual reporting function to ADB and the government. The mandate will \ncombine supervision with technical support to THL, particularly on reservoir sedimentation risk \nmanagement. Other project tasks include helping with land acquisition and resettlement, setting \nup  the  community  development  program,  and  supporting  the  overall  safeguard  work.  The \ngovernment and the executing agencies requested ADB to take advance actions on contracting \nall these services under ADB guidelines.  \n \n16.  Other arrangements. THL will enter into a power purchase agreement with NEA. A \ndraft term sheet for the agreement has been prepared and agreed between the parties. This \nfollows a cost-reflective tariff principle, a take-or-pay arrangement, appropriate penalty clauses, \nand an offtake payment security mechanism. ADB will be given a right to review and monitor \nthis agreement, including after project completion.  \n \n17.  Equity sale. One special feature of the project is the prospective sale of an equity stake \nin THL. The government has requested ADB to test the market and provide assistance for an \nequity sales scheme. A sale of this nature (either a majority or minority stake) could generate \nsignificant capital to kick-start other investments. Proceeds could also be used to restructure \nand recapitalize NEA. If a minority stake is involved, the divestment program will need to \ncombine the co-ownership with a management contract.  \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n18.   Consultants  will  assist  the  definition  and  execution  of  a  reform  program  and  the \nrestructuring of NEA. The TA will fund these advisors. Outputs will include (i) a restructuring \nplan for NEA, (ii) the development of a tariff rationalization mechanism under the Electricity \nTariff  Fixation  Commission  (ETFC),  and  (iii)  the  definition  of  a  private  sector  participation \nprogram. The advisors will also work on THL corporate governance.18 The TA is estimated to \ncost $1.5 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction, and administered by ADB.19 Further funding could be considered at a later stage if \nneeded.  \n \n                                                \n17  These contracts will be procured in accordance with the national competitive bidding procedures.  \n18  The TA will help THL establish commercially oriented corporate policies and practices including safeguards and \ngender aspects. \n19  Description of Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n ", "7 \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n19.  Experienced  international  advisors  carried  out  the  technical  due  diligence  work.  The \nproject will be the country\u2019s first reservoir hydropower plant with large water storage.20 To ensure \na sound least-cost design, full geological investigations and material tests were conducted over \nrelatively long periods of time. The greatest technical challenge before and after construction will \nbe sedimentation. To mitigate it, the proposed solution is a modern and tested sediment flushing \nsystem. Project design engineers and ADB-funded consultants conducted a hydraulic model test \nwith computer simulations to establish the best technical specifications to deliver maximum \ngeneration capacity and minimum impacts on the sediment, water flows, and the environment. \nAnnual electricity generation projections are 588 gigawatt-hours (GWh). This represents a 25% \nincrease from the original project studies.21 Because of the natural topographic conditions at the \nproject site, a narrow river and a deep V-shaped valley, the reservoir area will be limited to 7.26 \nsquare kilometers. This meets all technical eligibility requirements under the Clean Development \nMechanism, creating a potential income upside later during the commercial phase.22 Finally, the \nproject needs a 220 kV transmission line (37 km) and 220 kV substation facilities to evacuate the \ngenerated power.23 Site accessibility is good,24 as the plant is close to a major highway near \nPokhara, the second-largest city in Nepal.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n20.  The financial internal rate of return for the plant and its associated transmission facilities \nis 11.39%, higher than the weighted average cost of capital. The economic internal rate of \nreturn is 18.40% for the overall project.25 \n \nC.  Governance \n21.  The project will not be part of the NEA structure. THL has already been incorporated with \nits  own  management  structure.  Project  implementation  will  involve  an  independent  panel  of \nexperts to oversee and report on dam safety and safeguards. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, \nas amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government, THL, and NEA. The \nspecific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  project \nadministration manual and the loan documents. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n22.  Based on social and poverty surveys and assessments carried out in the project area, \nADB  devised  a  community  development  strategy  and  program  designed  to  increase  the \n                                                \n20  The project involves a 140 m high concrete gravity dam with a total storage capacity of 295 million cubic meters.  \n21  The annual generation was analyzed by a hydraulic model, which simulated optimal operations of the sediment \nflushing system. After 10 years, annual power generation is expected to fall to 490 GWh. This is because it will \ntake longer to flush cumulative sediments. During the operations of the sediment flushing, the plant needs to be \nstalled. \n22  The Clean Development Mechanism executive board accepts hydropower plants with power densities greater than \n4 watts per square meter (W/m2), and the restriction of project emissions from the reservoir type can be 10 W/m2. \nThe project has sufficient power density at 19.2 W/m2, making it potentially eligible. \n23  The 220 kV substation will be located within the Bharatpur substation, where the World Bank is financing a \ntransmission link to a new Hetauda substation, leading to trunk transmission lines that can support cross-border \ninterconnection.  \n24  Access roads will be around 7.3 km. The length of headrace and tailrace tunnels is around 1.4 km.  \n25  Financial Analysis; Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \ninvolvement of local communities in the entire operation, with focus on women, children, and \nsocially excluded groups. This strategy and program will deliver livelihoods and improve the \nquality of life of communities residing in the project area and affected in a direct and adverse \nmanner, by promoting awareness, accessibility, empowerment, employability, and vocational \nskills and microenterprise development. THL will implement the strategy and program with the \nhelp of an experienced nongovernment organization (NGO) or consulting firm with field-based \npartner NGOs.26 Alongside the strategy, a gender equality and social inclusion action plan has \nbeen developed and will be implemented to empower women and increase their participation as \nwell as their role and status within their families and communities. It is on this account that the \nproject is classified as effective gender mainstreaming.27 Besides the strategy and the gender \nequality  and  social  inclusion  action  plan,  the  rural  electrification  component  will  benefit \nhouseholds in the project area and its neighboring districts. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n23.  One of the biggest risks associated with projects of this nature is the treatment of \nsafeguards.  Besides  extensive  work  to  define  risks  and  solutions,  the  project  preparation \nprocess involved a series of consultations with affected communities. Independent advisors \ncarried out this due diligence. The project is classified as complex and sensitive and rated as \ncategory A for involuntary resettlement, indigenous peoples, and environment. The preparation \nprocess (assessments, consultations, and information) followed ADB\u2019s policies and procedures. \nResettlement and indigenous peoples planning frameworks have been formulated.28 Reservoir \nworks, access roads, project site construction, and other operations such as the erection of \npower generation facilities will require permanent and temporary acquisition of private and \npublic  land,  public  infrastructure  and  resources  such  as  trails,  suspension  bridges,  and \ncommunity forests. Based on project surveys, 758 households will be affected, including 86 that \nare  likely  to  be  physically  displaced.29 At  least  453  households  (60%  of  total  affected \nhouseholds) are Janajati\u2014an indigenous group forming the dominant population in the project \narea.  These  people  do  not  claim  ancestral  rights  over  the  land  where  they  live  or  earn \nlivelihoods from it. As a result, project impacts on them are similar to those in other affected \ncommunities. The involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples impacts of the project have \nbeen taken into account in a draft resettlement and indigenous peoples plan, which combines \ninvoluntary resettlement with indigenous peoples planning issues and appropriate mitigation \nactions. 30  \n \n24.  The  government  approved  an  environmental  impact  assessment  and  initial \nenvironmental  examination  for  the  hydropower  and  transmission  components.  To  provide \nsupplementary information required by ADB, an environmental addendum and a separate initial \nenvironmental examination for the rural electrification component were also prepared based on \n                                                \n26  After implementation of the strategy, the community development initiatives will be sustained in the project area \nthrough royalty allocations from the project revenues to village development committees, through a scheme to be \nregulated under the Local Self-Governance Act 1999.  \n27  The action plan has been prepared to optimize benefits for women and socially excluded groups through a range of \nactivities, such as participatory and socially inclusive consultation processes; promotion of women\u2019s equitable \naccess to skilled and unskilled work; rural electrification initiatives that specifically target vulnerable households \nheaded by women; support for women\u2019s microenterprise development initiatives; establishment and training of \nwomen\u2019s self-help groups; community development and livelihood enhancement for project-affected areas; gender \ntraining; and a monitoring and evaluation system for the action plan. \n28  Resettlement Framework; Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2).  \n29  Of the 86 physically displaced households, 37 will be displaced from the project\u2019s reservoir area and 49 will be \ndisplaced from the site development area due to the building of access roads.  \n30  Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n ", "9 \nadditional environmental surveys and research.31 The project area does not fall within a critical \nhabitat. The environmental management and monitoring plan includes a wide range of activities \nto appropriately mitigate or offset physical impacts,32 impacts on aquatic and terrestrial fauna \nand flora, and hydrological impacts in upstream and downstream areas.33 Information disclosure \nand consultations have been and will continue to be a priority, and follow ADB and government \nrequirements, including the establishment of a grievance redress mechanism. 34 The execution \nof the safeguard plans represents the first priority under the project. It will be supported by \nconsultants and NGOs to be recruited by ADB on behalf of the government and THL.35 These \nspecialists will  work closely  with the supervision consultants and an independent panel of \nexperts  focused  on  dam  safety,  and  social  and  environmental  safeguard  issues.  The \nconsultants will provide the skills transfer programs and the TA will also support institutional \ncapacity building.    \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n25.  Major risks and mitigating measures are given in Table 4 and described in more detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.36  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nCompletion and  Cost overrun risks are high but these will be contained through the deployment of \ncost risks  quality contractors and contracts with the right performance incentives. Changes in \ngeological conditions can lead to substantial cost variations in the civil works. Proper \ncoordination among the construction contractors is crucial. Experienced consultants \nwill supervise these contracts. \nOperational risk  A sediment flushing system operation is new in Nepal. It can be contained by an early-\nwarning system, the use of sound technical expertise, and quick preventive actions. \nSafeguard risk  This is one of the most serious risks but the mitigation plan is strong, backed by clear \n  actions and the use of quality expertise, extensive consultations, and an independent \n  panel of experts on dam safety, and social and environmental safeguards.  \nFunding risk  The budget process in Nepal is under stress but the authorities have assured the \n  financiers that the government will make the appropriate allocation of funding to the \nproject, and do so on time.  \nFiduciary risks  Transparency, quality, efficiency, and competition will be reinforced through a strong \nfacilitation role by ADB. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n                                                \n31  Environmental Impact Assessment; Initial Environmental Examinations; Environmental Addendum (accessible from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). These documents were disclosed on 30 July 2012. \n32  For example, riverbanks will be protected based on erosion hazard map. To deal with impacts of the hydrological \nfluctuations, an early-warning system will be installed coupled with public education programs.  \n33  ADB, cofinanciers, and the government will support (i) an aquatic fauna awareness and conservation program, \n(ii) a wildlife awareness and conservation program, (iii) a tree planting and watershed management program, and \n(iv) a river water safety program. These plans will be implemented in consultation with international NGOs and/or \nlocal civil society organizations. Particularly, the project will ensure safeguard compliance with habitat management \nthrough fish hatchery and relevant programs.  \n34  THL\u2019s social and environmental mitigation activities will be managed by its social and environmental management \nunit and two project information centers with support from expert consultants. NEA\u2019s environmental and social \nstudy department will be in charge of transmission and rural electrification components.  \n35  Being a recently constituted project company, THL does not have an established operational track record. THL\u2019s \nsafeguard capacity will be strengthened by external experts funded under the project.  \n36 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n26.  The government, NEA, and THL have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in the project administration manual and loan documents.
