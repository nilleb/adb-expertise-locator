With vast low-lying deltas, Bangladesh is regarded as particularly vulnerable to climate \nchange.  The  country  operations  business  plan  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for \nBangladesh 2009\u201320111 identifies two planned water sector investment projects in Khulna, \nwhere the consequences of climate change are expected to be particularly severe: the City \nRegion Development Project2 and the Khulna Water Supply Project. The timely implementation \nof policy and advisory technical assistance for assessing the impacts of climate change and \nidentifying adaptation options is deemed essential to maximize the development impacts of the \nplanned  projects.  This  view  was  fully  endorsed  by  the  Government  of  Bangladesh  (the \nGovernment)  during  the  Fact-Finding  Mission  for  project  preparatory  technical  assistance \n(PPTA) for the City Region Development Project in September 2008.  \n \n2.  A separate ADB Fact-Finding Mission visited Bangladesh from 12 to 16 October 2008. \nThis report is based on the understanding reached with the Government during the mission \nregarding  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing \narrangements, and outline terms of reference for the technical assistance (TA).3 The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Bangladesh  is  considered  one  of  the  countries  most  adversely  affected  by  climate \nchange. It is vulnerable to climate change because of its vast low-lying areas along the Ganges-\nBrahmaputra-Meghna  delta,  as  well  as  by  its  large  population,  high  population  density, \ninadequate infrastructure, low level of social development, lack of institutional capacity, and high \ndependence on natural resources. Though Bangladesh has made steady progress in terms of \nsocial and economic development and poverty alleviation, the country as a whole, and in \nparticular its poorer communities, could suffer early and badly from climate change, negating \nthese past achievements. Strengthening resilience to climate change is therefore central to the \nagenda for development and poverty reduction.  \n \n4.  As a response to the decision of the Seventh Session of the Conference of the Parties of \nthe  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  in  2001,  the  Government \nprepared in November 2005 the National Adaptation Programme of Action, which determined \nthat the most damaging effects of climate change are floods, salinity intrusion, and drought, and \nthat challenges induced by climate change include scarcity of freshwater, drainage congestion, \nriverbank erosion, and wider salinity in surface and ground water and soil. A thorough analysis \nidentified adaptation strategies that call for urgent and immediate attention and include capacity \nbuilding for integrating climate change into planning and designing infrastructure and enhancing \nthe resilience of urban infrastructure and industries. However, these strategies have not been \nadequately  translated  into  concrete  action  for  lack  of  human  resources  and  technical, \ninstitutional, and financial capacity. In response, the Government took further steps through the \nrecent adoption of the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP) in \nSeptember 2008, which will form the basis of the country\u2019s efforts to combat climate change \nover the next 10 years. BCCSAP addresses both mitigation and adaptation, with the emphasis \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008. Country Operations Business Plan: Bangladesh 2009-2011. Manila. \n2  City regions under the project will be identified on the bases of the output of the ongoing study Inclusive Growth \nand Good Governance for Clustered Cities Development: Innovative Interventions in South Asia and of initial \nassessments under the project preparatory technical assistance for the project. Khulna is likely to be included in \nthe project.     \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 15 November 2008.  \n ", "2   \non the latter, and identifies 37 priority programs under 6 pillars. Pillars for adaptation include \ncomprehensive disaster management, infrastructure, research and knowledge management, \nand capacity building.  \n \n5.  The impacts of climate change will be severe in urban areas, where drainage is already \na serious problem and sewers frequently back up in the wet monsoon, especially with higher \nand more intense rainfall. In addition, sea level rise could delay discharge from the drainage \nsystem in low-lying areas. Moreover, flooding by contaminated wastewater could cause serious \nhealth  risks.  Major  cities  are  increasingly  vulnerable,  and  drainage  capacity  needs  to  be \nimproved to prevent waterlogging. Another challenge in urban areas is the provision of safe \nwater. The increasing prevalence of droughts is affecting surface water and hand and shallow \ntube wells, and the situation may further deteriorate. In the coastal zones, salinity intrusion from \nsea level rise may affect the availability of fresh surface and ground water. Consideration should \nbe given to such measures as the conservation and treatment of water, rainwater harvesting, \nand monitoring of water quality and quantity. Improving urban drainage and implementing water \nand sanitation programs in areas vulnerable to climate change are among the priority actions \nunder the BCCSAP.    \n \n6.  Khulna, the third-largest city in Bangladesh, is located on the banks of the Rupsha and \nBhairab rivers in the southwest of the country, where the consequences of climate change are \nexpected to be particularly severe. It had a population of 1.4 million in 2007 in an area of 46 \nsquare  kilometers  (km2).  The  present  water  supply  to  Khulna  is  mainly  from  groundwater \nsources drawn from both deep and shallow tube wells. To cope with current insufficient supply \nand increasing demand, the Khulna Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (KWASA) plans to \nconstruct a new treatment plant for surface water with assistance from ADB and the Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency.    \n \n7.  The  increase  in  salinity  in  Khulna  started  after  the  commencement  in  1975  of  the \nFarakka  Barrage  operation  in  India,  which  significantly  reduced  the  flow  of  the  Ganges \nupstream of the Gorai River, a major source of freshwater to the rivers surrounding Khulna. \nSalinity near Khulna recorded in 2007 its highest level for the past 32 years. Sea level rise and \nprolonged dry weather are expected to further drive up salinity levels in Khulna. Therefore, \nfuture investments in water supply, such as the construction of water intake and treatment \nplants, need to incorporate climate change risks into their design. As groundwater is currently \nthe  major  source  of  water  in  the  area,  assessing  groundwater  resources,  including  the \npossibility of salinity intrusion in the aquifer, needs to be done.   \n \n8.  Khulna currently suffers recurring and worsening waterlogging problems. The situation \ncould be further exacerbated by increased rainfall and sea level rise. Careful assessments need \nto be undertaken on the extent of the impacts, on the bases of which appropriate response \nmechanisms need to be developed.  \n \n9.  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan  for  Bangladesh  (2009\u20132011)  identifies  two \nplanned projects in Khulna: the City Region Development Project (PPTA in 2008 and loan in \n2010)  and  the  Khulna  Water  Supply  Project  (PPTA  in  2010  and  loan  [standby]  in  2011). \nConsidering likely climate change impacts in Khulna, future investment projects in the water \nsector (e.g., water supply and drainage) need to be climate proof. Therefore, the TA will assess \nthe impacts of climate change on drainage, water availability, and salinity and recommend \npractical and effective options for such matters as the location of water intake works and the \nappropriate design of the drainage system. Structural and other options will be identified in the \n ", "    3\nTA and prioritized in a participatory manner. The output of the TA will be reflected in the design \nof these future projects and other Government interventions.    \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The main outcome of the TA is a list of adaptation options, both structural and not, \nprepared for two planned investment projects\u2014the City Region Development Project and the \nKhulna Water Supply Project\u2014as well as for other Government projects and policy actions. The \nimpact of the TA is the strengthened resilience of the water sector in Khulna to climate change.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  in  three  steps.  The  first  step  will  (i)  collect  data  on \nhydrometeorology, water salinity, and the outputs of various modeling results and analyses in \nKhulna and surroundings and (ii) assess plausible climate scenarios for 2030 and 2050. In the \nsecond step, the TA team will (i) collect data on and review existing structures and future \nimprovement plans in the water sector; (ii) collect socioeconomic data such as population \ndensity, population trends, and damage caused by past extreme weather events, as well as \ndata related to physical characteristics such as topography, land use, and land subsidence; (iii) \nreview land-use plans and policies and current local practices coping with climate variability and \nextreme weather events, such as early warning systems and evacuation plans; and (iv) conduct \nhydrological simulation and assessment of flooding, water salinity, and other impacts on the \nwater  sector  using  mathematical  modeling.  Assessment  results  will  be  presented  in  a \ngeographic information system map. Tasks conducted in the third step will comprise the (i) \nidentification of adaptation options, both structural and not, focusing on the water sector; (ii) \npreliminary assessment of the feasibility of each option, with due consideration to effectiveness, \nurgency, associated benefits and costs, and social acceptability, as well as the identification of \nthe relevant agencies responsible for implementation; (iii) prioritization of preferred options \nthrough a participatory approach; and (iv) integration of priority actions into the designs of future \nADB-assisted projects and other Government projects and policy actions.  \n \n12.   The  TA  will  strengthen  capacity  and  raise  awareness  regarding  climate  change. \nWorkshops and other training programs will be carried out mainly for officials of central and local \ngovernment departments and agencies. Other key stakeholders, such as universities, research \ninstitutes, nongovernment organizations, and the private sector, will be invited to the workshops, \nwhere the objectives, progress, and outputs of the TA will be shared and discussions will take \nplace to prioritize various adaptation options. Based on the experiences of TA implementation, \nrecommendations will be provided for further capacity-building and public-awareness programs, \nas well as for scaling up and replicating interventions in other areas in Bangladesh and other \ncountries.  \n \n13.  A major risk of the TA arises from the uncertainty of the climate scenarios upon which \nthe impact assessment will be based. The resolution of global and other circulation models is \nnot fine enough to remove a certain degree of uncertainty. The most up-to-date data will be \nutilized, and the appropriateness of the identified scenarios will be ensured by experienced \ninternational experts. The quality and quantity of data used for mathematical modeling is also a \nrisk, so necessary primary data will be collected by TA consultants for model development and \ncalibration. The degree of uncertainty will be addressed in evaluating various adaptation options \nand considered in prioritization processes. Another risk is a potential delay in prioritizing options, \n ", "4   \nas selection involves value judgments and divergent views are expected among stakeholders. \nTo mitigate this risk, the TA will be undertaken in a consultative and participatory manner from \nthe beginning to foster common understanding and raise awareness, and it will present options \nin an easily understandable manner to facilitate prioritization. The TA will closely coordinate with \nother  ongoing  and  planned  project  preparatory  work  to  avoid  duplication  and  ensure  that \nprioritized options are taken up by future ADB-assisted projects and other interventions, under \nthe close supervision of the Executing Agency (EA), implementing agencies (IAs), and other \ndepartments of the Government and ADB.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $720,000 equivalent, $600,000 of which will be \nfinanced as a grant by ADB\u2019s Climate Change Fund. The Government will finance the remaining \n$120,000  equivalent  to  cover  remunerating  counterpart  staff  and  providing  office  space, \nfurniture,  equipment,  and  workshop  venues. The  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan  are  in \nAppendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The Local Government Division (LGD) will be the EA, and the Khulna City Corporation \n(KCC) and KWASA will be the IAs. LGD will assign counterpart staff and ensure the provision of \noffice space, furniture, equipment, and workshop venues by itself and/or with KCC and/or \nKWASA. Both KCC and KWASA will appoint a TA coordinator and technical and support \ncounterpart staff for the TA consultants. Locally, a working committee will be established, co-\nchaired by the chief engineer of KCC and the executive engineer of KWASA and comprising \nmembers from KCC, KWASA, Khulna Development Authority, surrounding municipalities, and \nlocal offices of the Local Government Engineering Department, Department of Public Health \nEngineering, and Bangladesh Water Development Board. Other resource persons or relevant \nentities may participate in a working committee as appropriate. Centrally, a steering committee \nwill be formulated for TA implementation, headed by the secretary of LGD and comprising \nsenior officials from the Department of Environment, Economic Relations Division, Bangladesh \nWater Development Board, Local Government Engineering Department, Department of Public \nHealth Engineering, KCC, and KWASA. LGD\u2019s role as the EA is deemed appropriate mainly \nbecause (i) the TA\u2019s geographical boundary will not be limited to the jurisdiction of KCC or \nKWASA, requiring coordination with and support from surrounding municipalities, and, (ii) while \nthe  TA  is  focused  on  Khulna,  the  methodology  used  and  knowledge  products  developed, \nincluding adaptation options, are expected to be replicated in other areas of the country.  \n \n16.  The  first  working  committee  meeting  will  be  held  no  later  than  2  weeks  after  the \ncommencement of TA, and the working committee will meet at least once a month for smooth \ncoordination during TA implementation. The steering committee will meet when reports have \nbeen submitted by the TA consultants to discuss the progress of TA and provide policy inputs \nand guidance to the TA. As the TA is closely aligned with BCCSAP, the steering committee is \nexpected to serve as an important vehicle for widely disseminating TA progress and outputs \namong stakeholders.     \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 10 months, from March to December 2009. Consulting \nservices totaling 38.5 person-months (7 person-months of international and 31.5 person-months \nof national) will be required. International expertise will be obtained in climate change adaptation \n(scenario assessment), mathematical modeling, and water sector planning. National consultants \nwill have expertise in geographic information systems, modeling (hydraulic, salinity, and urban \n ", "    5\ndrainage), water sector engineering, hydrogeology, social development and participation, urban \nplanning, public health, and economic and financial management. International consultants will \nsupervise and coordinate with the work of national consultants. In addition to consulting services, \nresource persons may be invited to speak at workshops to provide the latest knowledge on \nclimate change modeling and adaptation planning to key stakeholders and the consultants. \n \n18.  The  consultants  and  resource  persons  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). ADB will engage \nconsulting services for the TA in two separate packages. Three international consultants will be \nrecruited through a firm, using the consultants\u2019 qualifications selection method. The use of \nconsultants\u2019 qualifications is considered appropriate because highly specialized qualifications in \nthe field of climate change are required for the services. National consultants will be recruited \nthrough single-source selection of the consulting firm Institute of Water Modelling, Bangladesh. \nThe firm is the only entity in Bangladesh with the capacity to carry out complex and high-quality \nmathematical modeling. It has developed the mathematical models needed and undertaken \nintensive  work  in  assessing  climate  change  impacts  on  the  water  sector,  including  water \nresource analyses in Khulna in 2007, which the TA will build on. Single-source selection will \ntherefore have the advantage of utilizing a firm with unique knowledge of sector issues and \nsuitability to apply cumulative knowledge in performing the assigned tasks. The consulting firm \nwill submit a biodata technical proposal and a financial proposal for review to ensure adequacy \nand enable subsequent contract negotiations. The resource persons will be selected through \nsingle-source selection. Outline terms of reference for consultants and resource persons are \nprovided in Appendix 3. Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2008, as amended from time to time). \n \n19.  The team of consultants will submit four major reports: (i) an inception report within 4 \nweeks after the commencement of the TA, (ii) an interim report within 24 weeks, (iii) a draft final \nreport within 34 weeks, and (iv) a final report 3 weeks after the final workshops organized at \nKhulna and Dhaka and the receipt of comments from the Government and ADB on the draft \nfinal report.     \n \n20.  Some equipment, such as computers and printers, will be procured under the TA using \nthe shopping method in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). All equipment purchased under the TA will be handed over to the IAs after \nTA completion.     \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Bangladesh for Strengthening the Resilience of the Water Sector in Khulna \nto Climate Change, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and/or \nDesign  Performance Targets and/or  Assumptions and \nReporting \nSummary  Indicators  Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact        Assumptions \n       \nStrengthened  Prioritized adaptation options taken up  Government reports  Government \nresilience of the water  by planned investment projects and    commitment to address \nsector in Khulna to  other Government projects and policy  adaptation in urban \nclimate change   actions  areas  \n   \nRecommendations of \nTA implemented \n \nRisk \nClimate change impacts \nseverer than expected   \n \nOutcome      Assumption \n       \nPrioritized list of  Sufficient consultation and  Government reports  Appropriate and timely \nadaptation options,  comprehensive evaluation led to the    participation of and \nboth structural and  prioritized adaptation measures (both  ADB missions  consultation with key \nnot, prepared for two  structural and not) agreed with the    stakeholders   \nplanned investment  Government  TA reports   \nprojects\u2014City Region      Risk \nDevelopment Project  TA report acceptable to the  Poor coordination \nand Khulna Water  Government and ADB  among central and local \nSupply Project\u2014as  government \nwell as for other  departments  \nGovernment of   \nBangladesh projects \nand policy actions  \n \nOutputs       Assumption \n       \n1.

The terms of reference of the \nconsultants and resource persons will include, but not be limited to, the following: \n \nA.  Consultants \n \n  1.  Specific Tasks of Consultants \n  a.  Assessment of Climate Change Scenarios in Khulna  \n2.  Collect secondary data related to hydrometeorology (river and sea level, river flow, \nrainfall,  cyclone  level,  storm  surges,  river  and  urban  flooding,  temperature,  groundwater \nextraction, etc.), water salinity, and the outputs of various modeling results and analyses in the \ntarget area. Review and assess projections of future water withdrawal upstream. Utilize reliable \nsecondary data as much as possible and, where such data are not available, make the direct \nmeasurements necessary to develop and calibrate models.    \n \n3.  Assess plausible climate scenarios (sea level rise, increased intensity of rainfall and \ncyclones, storm surges, etc.) for 2030 and 2050. While analyzing the data and simulation results \navailable,  including  the  scenarios  prepared  in  the  4th  assessment  report  of  the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), make the best professional judgment in \nassessing future climate scenarios.  At least two scenarios will be prepared.  \n \nb.  Assessment  of  Impacts  on  the  Water  Sector  Caused  by  Climate \nChange  \n \n4.  Collect available data and review the status of existing structures and future plans for \nextending and/or upgrading structures in the water sector (water supply, sanitation, sewerage, \nand drainage systems). Data to be collected can include type, location, and capacity of water \nsupply, drainage and wastewater treatment assets; water service coverage; and coverage of \nsewage disposal and sanitation systems.  \n \n5.  Collect available socioeconomic and physical data. Socioeconomic data to be collected \ninclude population density, population trends, the location of slum areas, damage caused by \npast extreme weather events, and those related to public health such as the incidence of \ndisease related to extreme weather events, such as waterborne diseases. Data to be collected \non physical characteristics include topography, land use, and land subsidence. Historical and \nprojected data will be collected. Where data are insufficient, take measurements as needed.    \n \n6.  Review land-use plans and policies and current local practices for coping with climate \nvariability and extreme weather events, such as early warning systems and evacuation planning.  \n \n7.  Simulate the hydrology of urban watersheds and determine flooding, salinity, and other \nimpacts using climate scenarios identified in para. 3 above. Based on the modeling results \n(water availability, water salinity, and extent of flooding), assess social and economic impacts in \nthe water sector (water supply, sanitation, and sewage and drainage systems) both qualitatively \nand quantitatively, including their public health implications and impacts on the poor. The results \n ", "10   Appendix 3 \nof model estimations for the calibration period will be cross-checked with past data to justify and \ndocument the robustness of the models.  \n  \n8.  Preparation  of  geographic  information  system  (GIS)-based  digital  map  on  the \nassessment results. The GIS-based digital map will show flooded areas and duration, salinity \nintrusion, and other impacts of climate change under various model results.   \n \n  c.
