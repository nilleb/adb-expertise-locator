The links lie in trans-island corridors \nand serve interregional trade and local traffic, providing a corridor \nfrom  Indonesia  to  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations \n(ASEAN) highway through links with Malaysia and Brunei. The Project \nwill  strengthen  the  capacity  of  central  and  provincial  agencies  to \nmaintain and protect road surfaces and reduce the risk of accidents in \nareas of growing traffic. The Project includes training and capacity-\nbuilding subcomponents. \n   \nRationale  Since the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis, the Government has focused \non  macroeconomic  stabilization,  corporate  restructuring,  bank \nrecapitalization,  and  mobilization  of  resources to  strengthen  social \nsafety nets. As a result of scarce financial resources, spending on the \ntransport  infrastructure,  specifically  roads,  was  cut.  As  part  of  its \nnational  transport  network  development  plan,  the  Government  is \nfocusing on upgrading and developing main national road corridors to \nimprove intra- and interisland transport links, within Indonesia and \nwith other neighboring countries. The Kalimantan Highway corridor, in \nparticular, is a major link between Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, and \nMalaysia that will promote regional cooperation. With fiscal constraints \nlikely to remain, external support is critical to preserving, upgrading, \nand developing priority links and supporting economic recovery. In \nSumatra and Kalimantan, an inadequate road network has increased \ntransport costs for the important agricultural, plantation, petroleum, \nand  industrial  sectors;  raised  transport  costs  between  provincial \ncenters and plantation areas and ports; and limited local transport. By \nimproving the condition of high-priority links, the Project will facilitate \ntrade,  investment,  and  economic  growth;  promote  regional \ncooperation;  improve  accessibility  and  living  conditions  in  isolated \nareas  that  have  growth  prospects;  and  help  reduce  poverty.  The \nProject also aims to develop new approaches to road maintenance \nmanagement and institutional capacity building and training related to \nroad policy. The Project is in line with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s \n(ADB) strategic focus for Indonesia and included in the 2005 country \nstrategy and program update. ", "ii   \nImpact and Outcome  The expected impact of the Project is economic growth and improved \nliving  conditions  in  poor  areas  of  Sumatra  and  Kalimantan.  The \nprimary  outcome  of  the  Project  is  improved  vehicular  access  via \nstrategic national roads on these islands. The Project will help reduce \ntransport tariffs, improve road safety, reduce truck overloading, and \npromote financial transparency through better fiduciary control and \nanticorruption measures. Combined with other activities of the country \nstrategy and program, it will help reduce poverty in project areas. It \nwill rehabilitate about 1,300 kilometers (km) of deteriorated roads and \nreplace or widen about 40 bridges on the Trans-Sumatra Central and \nEastern corridors and Trans-Kalimantan Highway, linking producing \nareas and markets through 10 provinces on the country\u2019s two largest \nislands.  To  ensure  that  the  rehabilitated  roads  do  not  deteriorate \nprematurely  and  to  secure  sustainable  benefits,  the  Project  will \ninclude measures to reduce pavement damage caused by overloaded \ntrucks.  Working  with  local  agencies,  it  will  explore  new  ways  of \nutilizing available resources to maintain roads and reduce the risk of \naccidents in roadside communities by raising awareness of the risk. \nThe training and capacity-building components include environmental \nand  social  impact  management,  as  well  as  training  in  project \nmanagement  and  engineering  support  practices,  including  (i) \nconstruction contract law; (ii) landslide control, slope stability, and \nretaining walls; (iii) financial management and control; (iv) road and \nbridge  maintenance;  and  (v)  technical  specifications  in  road  and \nbridge works.  \n   \nCost Estimates  The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $215.8  million  equivalent \n(including taxes), consisting of $76.2 million in foreign exchange costs \nand $139.6 million equivalent in local currency costs. \n   \n($ million, 2005 prices)\nFinancing Plan  Source  Foreign  Local  Total  Total Cost \n  Exchange  Currency    (%) \nADB  76.2  74.8  151.0  70 \nGovernment  0.0  64.8  64.8  30 \nTotal  76.2  139.6  215.8  100 \nSource: ADB estimates. \n   \nLoan Amount and  A loan of $151 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nTerms  provided  under  a  lending  facility  based  on  the  London  interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR).

The PMU will supervise three implementing agencies\u2014DGH, \nthe Directorate General of Land Communications (DGLC), and the \nNational  Development  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS).  DGH  will \ncoordinate  design,  implementation  and  supervision  of  the  road \nrehabilitation,  and  capacity-building  components.  DGLC  will \nimplement the enforcing controls on the truck overloading and road \nsafety  awareness  subcomponents.  BAPPENAS  will  implement  the \nsubcomponent on developing new approaches to road maintenance \nmanagement. DGH\u2019s local project management will be carried out by \nthe provincial road and bridge planning and management units in the \n10 provinces, assisted by consultants funded under the Project. A \nsteering  committee  representing  Government  agencies  involved  in \nnational  development  planning,  finance,  roads,  road  traffic,  and \ntransport will monitor project progress. \n   \nProcurement  All civil works under the Project will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Contracts valued in excess of $1.0 \nmillion  for goods  and $1.5  million  for  civil  works  will  be  procured \nthrough  international  competitive  bidding,  with  smaller  civil  works \ncontracts procured through local competitive bidding. Supply contracts \nnot  exceeding  $1.0  million  will  be  procured  through  international \nshopping. It is, however, expected that only international competitive \nbidding will be used for the 26 contract packages to be awarded under \nthe Project. Equipment and spare parts required for the Project, and \nestimated  to  cost,  in  the  aggregate,  the  equivalent  of  less  than \n$100,000 may be procured directly from the manufacturers of the \noriginal equipment or their agents. All contracts will be submitted to \nADB for approval before they are awarded.  \n   \nConsulting Services  A  total  of  274  person-months  of  international  and  3,324  person-\nmonths  of  domestic  consulting  will  be  required  to  assist  with  (i) \ndetailed design, review, coordination, and construction supervision of \ncivil works; (ii) enforcement of truck axle-load limits; (iii) road safety \nawareness campaign; (iv) development of new approaches to road \nmaintenance  management;  (v)  strengthening  of  capabilities  in \nenvironmental  and  social  impact  management;  and  (vi)  training  in \nproject  management  and  engineering  support  practices.  The \nconsultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB \nfor engaging consultants. \n \nProject Benefits and  By  improving  national  roads  and  bridges,  the  Project  will  reduce \nBeneficiaries  transport costs and improve accessibility, thus facilitating economic \ngrowth and improving the welfare of the poor. The main beneficiaries \nwill be road users, passengers, freight transport services, and the \npopulation served by rehabilitated roads. \n ", "iv   \n   \nRisks and  The  main  risks  to  the  Project  are  (i)  failure  to  maintain  the \nAssumptions  rehabilitated roads, (ii) premature damage to pavement as a result of \ntruck  overloading,  (iii)  increased  risk  of  accidents,  (iv)  lower-than-\nforecast economic growth, (v) lack of response by local communities \nto increased trade and jobs, and (vi) inadequate quality of project \noutcomes due to corrupt practices in procurement and other areas of \nproject implementation. The first three risks will be minimized through \ntechnical assistance, training, and a road safety awareness campaign. \nThe fourth and fifth will be monitored through a benefit-monitoring \nprogram, periodically targeting responses of local communities to the \nroads\u2019 improvement. The last risk will be minimized by strengthening \nimplementation  and  control  mechanisms  through  an  action  plan \nincluded in the project design.  ", "  v ", "vi \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Indonesia for the Road Rehabilitation-2 Project (the Project).  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES1 \n2.  Rehabilitation of high-priority road links in Sumatra and Kalimantan aims to improve \naccessibility; facilitate trade, investment, and economic growth; and improve living conditions of \npeople  living  in  isolated  areas.  The  Project also  aims  to  promote  regional  cooperation  by \ndeveloping corridor linkages to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Highway in \nKalimantan and the Asian Highway in Sumatra. The project design and monitoring framework is \nin Appendix 1.  \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n1.  The Road Sector  \n3.  Road transport carried about 95% of Indonesia\u2019s estimated interprovincial freight and \n85% of passenger traffic in 2001 (2003 estimates).2 At the end of 2002, Indonesia\u2019s road \nnetwork  was  close  to 324,150  kilometers  (km),  excluding  515  km  of  toll  roads  and  some \n250,000 km of unclassified village roads (Appendix 2). Despite recent funding increases and a \nrenewed emphasis on maintenance, roads have not yet returned to the condition they were in \nbefore the Asian financial crisis of 1997/98. \n \n4.  In 2003, 32.7 million vehicles (excluding police and military vehicles) were registered, of \nwhich 14.8% were passenger cars, 6.0% buses and vans, 8.2% trucks, and 71.0% motorcycles. \nRoad transport services are mainly provided by private companies. Except in remote areas\u2014\nwhere demand is thin, investors few, and road conditions poor\u2014the transport services industry \nis competitive. Entry is largely unrestricted and tariffs determined by market forces, with the \nexception of fares for low-income passenger services set by the Government for interprovincial \nservices and by provincial authorities for services within provinces. Even so, there is competition \non the basis of service quality and frequency. In general, savings in vehicle operating costs \nmade possible by road improvements are passed on through reductions or delayed increases in \nfares. \n \n5.  Four national Government agencies play key roles in the road sector. The National \nDevelopment  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS)  formulates  national  development  strategies, \nestablishes  broad  policy  and  investment  priorities,  and  prepares  and  supervises  the \nimplementation of annual development budgets. The Ministry of Communications (MOC) is \nresponsible for policy formulation, and for planning, regulating, and managing most transport \ninfrastructure (except roads) and some transport services. Within MOC, the Directorate General \nfor Land Communications (DGLC) is responsible for land communications. The Ministry of \nPublic  Works  (MPW),  through  its  Directorate  General  of  Highway  (DGH),  develops  and \nmaintains the national roads, sets technical standards for all types of roads, and provides \ntechnical assistance (TA) to road agencies at the lower administration levels. DGH has regional \noffices (P3JJ) for road design and supervision. The Ministry of Home Affairs coordinates the \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2002.

", "2   \nmanagement of lower levels of government (provinces, districts, and municipalities) in relation to \nthe road sector. \n \n2.  Sector Policy Framework \n6.  Like other sectors, road transport sector growth and performance have been affected by \ndecentralization.  As  part  of  the  fiscal  and  administrative  decentralization  process,  made \neffective  in  2001,  Law  32/2004  (revised  22/1999)  has  transferred  most  Government \nresponsibilities to the regions, with regencies (kabupaten) and cities (kota) as the main focal \npoints. Law 33/2004 (revised 25/1999) specifies how the new regional responsibilities are to be \nfinanced. For instance, motor vehicle fuel taxes are collected directly by provinces or kabupaten \nfor their own purposes. \n \n7.  MOC has developed the 2005\u20132009 transport strategic plan, and DGLC periodically \nupdates its policy statement and action plan (PSAP) for roads, traffic, and transport. The first \nPSAP was issued in 1989; the most recent draft covers 2001\u20132005. The latest ADB road project \nin Indonesia\u2014the Road Rehabilitation (Sector) Project (RRSP)3\u2014includes a component to help \nDGLC  monitor  the  PSAP\u2019s  progress  and  implement  policies  related  to  user  charges,  cost \nrecovery,  road  maintenance  funding,  vehicle  overloading,  road  safety,  and  private  sector \nparticipation. This component helps amend road and road transport regulations to encourage \ncompetition in road transport services, and strengthen road management and development \nplanning. \n \n3.  Road Expenditure Management Systems  \n8.  Road and bridge expenditure needs are assessed using DGH\u2019s Indonesian integrated \nroad management system (IIRMS). Developed through the 1980s and 1990s, this computer-\nassisted  tool  maximizes  the  benefits  of  road  improvements  and  maintenance  funding \nallocations. IIRMS predicts pavement deterioration over time and under traffic load. The system \nanalyzes the impacts of alternative treatment options for each link, thereby determining the \neconomically optimum expenditure scenario, with or without budget constraints. DGH assesses \nbudget requirements mainly on IIRMS outputs, but sometimes combines them with broader \nstrategies for network development. One such strategy is to develop key corridors to link main \npopulation centers and facilitate trade within the country and with external markets. The links \nproposed for the Project all lie along priority corridors under this strategy (Maps 1 and 2). \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Sector Problems, Causes, and Impacts \n9.  The three interconnected key sectoral problems are (i) road deterioration, (ii) vehicle \noverloading and inefficient road transport operations, and (iii) road traffic accidents. Appendix 3 \nshows the interactions between them, their causes, and their impacts. \n \n10.  Road Deterioration and Limited Maintenance Fund. Deteriorated national roads raise \nthe costs of road transport by increasing the consumption of fuel, oil and tires; increasing \nvehicle wear and tear; and raising vehicle insurance rates. Poor road conditions reduce vehicle \n                                                 \n3 ADB. 2000. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of Indonesia for the Road Rehabilitation Sector Project. Manila (Loan 1798-INO, for $190 million, \napproved in December 2000). \n \n ", "  3\nspeeds, lowering the productivity of vehicles and people. Increased transport costs are passed \non to consumers, who pay higher prices to travel or to move commodities, reducing their \nwillingness to pay and, hence, their mobility and access to economic and welfare opportunities. \nRoad maintenance is therefore essential to reduce transport costs.  \n \n11.  Road  cost  recovery  must  be  improved  to  sustain  maintenance  funding  and  reduce \ndependency on variable budgets.4 User charges mainly consist of (i) vehicle ownership transfer \nfees, (ii) annual vehicle registration fees, and (iii) a 5% fuel tax. Revenues from taxes and fees \nconstitute a major part of provinces\u2019 self-generated funds. These fees are treated as general tax \nrevenues and are not incomes dedicated to road maintenance, considering that users receive \nsubsidies in the form of below-market prices for fuel. These subsidies were estimated for 2004 \nat Rp60 trillion (close to the Government\u2019s whole development budget of Rp75 trillion for 2004), \nbut the Government reduced the fuel subsidy by increasing prices of major fuel products by 22\u2013\n53% on 28 February 2005. These increases could not totally remove the subsidies because of \nhigh international oil prices. This is, however, a major step to set up a healthier fuel pricing \nstructure, and will further ease the Government\u2019s fiscal constraints on road maintenance. The \nnew road law also ensures that priority will be given to road maintenance budget, although it \ndoes not plan to create a dedicated road fund. The budget allocation for road and bridge \nmaintenance for national roads increased significantly in 2002 but has only increased slightly \nfrom 2003 to 2005. The current level road maintenance of about Rp1.2 trillion is obviously still \nbelow the requirement for all Indonesian provinces. \n \n12.  Vehicle Overloading and Inefficiencies in Road Transport Operations. The common \npractice of vehicle overloading increases total road transport costs by accelerating pavement \ndeterioration. Vehicle-weighing stations are obsolete, badly maintained, or improperly operated. \nRecords  are  often  unreliable,  corruption  occurs  frequently,  and  traffic  regulations  are  not \nenforced. The number of prosecutions against road violators is negligible. The World Bank\u2019s \nSumatra Region Roads Project has been trying on a pilot basis since early 2004 to have four \nweighbridges managed by private operators (one in Aceh Province and three in West Sumatra \nProvince).5 Under this initiative, the weighbridges have been upgraded and supplemented by \nautomatic  weigh-in-motion  (WIM)  equipment  that  allows  crosschecking  of  the  weighbridge \nrecords. Other bridge design measures need to be provided to mitigate pavement overloading, \nfor  example,  installation  of  bridge  height  clearance  structures  to  control  the  passage  of \noverloaded or oversized vehicles.  \n  \n13.  Other inefficiencies in road transport operations stem from poor pavement conditions, \npoor driving standards, low standards of vehicle maintenance, poor fleet management, and \ninappropriate vehicle technologies. This is mainly due to an inadequate road user taxation \nsystem  that  does  not  require  sufficient  users\u2019  contribution  to  road  costs,  and  gives  truck \noperators  no  incentive  to  replace  old,  inefficient  vehicles  with  more  modern,  multiple-axle \nvehicles that do less pavement damage per ton of payload.  \n \n14.  Road Traffic Accidents. Indonesia\u2019s high levels of road traffic accidents are the result \nof poor standards of driver education, training, and testing; poor vehicle safety standards; and \nlimited awareness of accident risk\u2014all attributable to shortcomings in traffic education and \nenforcement. Accident risks are made worse by insufficient attention to safety features in road \n                                                 \n4 The World Bank\u2019s Eastern Indonesia Region Transport Project envisages road maintenance through multiyear \ncontracts to the private sector; should such a system be implemented, annual availability of funds would no longer \nbe a constraint. The project includes a trial implementation of a provincial road fund sourced from user charges \ncollected by the province. \n5   Based on a recent status report by DGLC, the results are encouraging. \n ", "4   \ndesign. In 2003, about 10,000 road fatalities (3 deaths per 10,000 registered vehicles) and more \nthan 14,000 serious injuries were recorded. The actual figures may be higher as transport \ndepartment records differ significantly from the traffic police records to the hospitals. A high \nproportion of victims are pedestrians. The social and economic costs of road fatalities, injuries, \nand material damage have been estimated about 2\u20133% of gross domestic product (GDP). \nUnder  ADB\u2019s  regional  road  safety  TA,6  ASEAN  member  countries  are  committed  to \nimplementing the ASEAN Road Safety Strategy and Action Plan 2005\u20132010, comprising 12 \nactions. The Project will help the Government implement two actions identified under the plan: \npromoting greater awareness and steady enforcement of traffic rules and regulations, and \nfostering a culture of road safety. \n \n2.  Road Connectivity and Poverty Reduction \n15.  Indonesia\u2019s poverty incidence was about 23% (about 48 million people) in 1998, then \ndeclined to about 18% (about 38 million) in 2002, according to the National Socioeconomic \nSurvey (BPS SUSENAS).7 Regional variations are sharp: poverty is more common in rural \nareas than in urban centers, and in the project area, it varies from 18% in Riau to 42% in South \nSumatra, and 30% in South Kalimantan to 57% in Central Kalimantan.  \n \n16.  National roads are the arteries of trade and commerce and enable the incomes of the \npoor  to  grow.  Agriculture  products\u2014cultivated  largely  by  the  poor,  who  rely  on  basic \ncommodities hauled in from cities\u2014need an effective transportation network to be delivered on \ntime. The poverty assessment done in November 2000 notes that increasing the productivity of \nagriculture  requires  improved  infrastructure,  including  transport,  which  will  reduce  regional \ndisparity and rural poverty over the medium term. The Government White Paper8 identifies the \ninfrastructure backlog as a key bottleneck to poverty reduction. Better roads will improve access \nby the poor, as well as doctors and teachers, to health centers and schools. \n \n  3.  Government and ADB Transport Sector Strategies \n \n17.  The  2004\u20132009  Government  midterm  development  plan  places  high  priority  on  the \ndevelopment of infrastructure within the overarching objectives of creating peace and security, \ncreating democracy and fairness, and improving people\u2019s prosperity. Road development policy \nprioritizes on increasing road capacity and quality to more developed regions by strengthening \nisland-based  main  national  road  corridors  and  providing  better  access  to  less  developed \nregions, including remote and border areas. The development of these national corridors is part \nof the Government\u2019s commitment to the ASEAN regional cooperation program, which requires \nimplementation of priority infrastructure projects at national level. Improving integration and \nconnectivity,  developing  land  transport  and  trade  corridors  linking  Brunei  Darussalam, \nIndonesia, and Malaysia are ASEAN milestone objectives. The Project is in line with ADB\u2019s \nstrategic focus for Indonesia and is included in the 2005 country strategy and program update. It \nis also an integral part of ADB\u2019s regional cooperation strategy and program for Southeast Asia, \nwhich is being prepared.9 \n \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance for Road Safety in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Manila (TA 6077-\nREG). \n7   Excludes Papua and Aceh. \n8   INPRES 5/2003. \n9  It will cover Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, and Singapore.  \n ", "  5\n4.  Road Sector Assistance and Lessons Learned \n18.  ADB has assisted Indonesia\u2019s road sector since 1976. ADB\u2019s total lending amounts to \n$1.57 billion for 15 projects, 14 of which have been completed. Indonesia had received about \n$7.6 billion in foreign assistance for road development from 1984 to 2003. Of this, 33% came \nfrom the World Bank and 33% from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC). ADB\u2019s \ncontribution was about 17% and bilateral funding agencies from countries such as Australia, \nAustria, Germany, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United States provided the remaining 17%. \nADB has also provided grants totaling $4.3 million (Appendix 4).  \n \n19.  Project completion reports have been prepared for 14 ADB-financed road projects, with \nall rated projects considered successful except one partly successful. Performance audit reports \nhave been prepared for 9 projects, all rated successful. The reports identified the following key \nlessons: (i) in the short term, projects should focus on periodic maintenance and rehabilitation; \n(ii) simplified design procedures used by DGH to prepare subprojects on a network basis should \nbe replaced with detailed design methods; (iii) economic evaluation should be more thorough, \nespecially traffic growth projections; (iv) greater attention should be paid to drainage structures; \n(v) periodic maintenance should not compensate for delayed or poor routine maintenance; and \n(vi) the capacity of the executing agency and its relationship with the implementing agency are \ncrucial to project success. Another lesson is that capacity and institution building should be \nimplemented regularly to avoid skill loss as a result of staff retirement or transfer.  \n \n20.  Recently, projects have been delayed by lack or late release of counterpart funds, and \nby land acquisition and resettlement problems, especially the North Java Road Improvement \nProject.10 Resettlement issues have been minimized under the RRSP, which, however, suffered \nother delays (para. 21). Fraudulent practices and corruption, especially in procurement, were \nalso perceived to have led to poor quality of work. \n  \n21.  Lessons  from  the  RRSP.  The  RRSP  is  behind  schedule  due  mainly  to  delays  in \nrecruiting the consultants, preparing the subprojects\u2019 reports and detailed designs, and issuing \nand approving the bidding documents for the civil works. As of mid August 2005, 33% of the \nRRSP had been disbursed and 73% of the contracts awarded. While the problems that delayed \nthe  RRSP  have  been  resolved,  the  late  release  of  the  2005  counterpart  funds  set  back \nimplementation. Efforts have been made to tackle this issue, and adequate counterpart funds \nare now available. The RRSP disbursement rate is now improving and cumulative disbursement \nis projected to be close to 50% by early 2006 when the implementation of the Project is \nexpected to start. All contracts will be awarded by early 2006 and the RRSP is expected to be \ncompleted by the extended loan closing date.11 \n \n22.  The lessons learned under the RRSP have been incorporated into the proposed Project. \nTaking  advantage  of  the  ADB-approved  advance  actions  for  procurement,  preconstruction \nactivities for the first year of implementation are being carried out using RRSP consultants \n(para. 32). Bids for the first year of rehabilitation works are expected to be called in October \n2005 and recommendations for contract award should be issued in early 2006. Concurrently, \nthe  recruitment  of  consultants  for  design  and  construction  supervision  has  started. \nRecommendations for award of consultants\u2019 contracts are expected by December 2005.  \n \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 1995. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan and \nTechnical Assistance Grant to the Republic of Indonesia for the North Java Road Improvement Project. Manila \n(Loan 1428-INO for $150 million, approved January 1996 and completed in December 2002).  \n11  ADB approved on 10 March 2005 an extension of the loan closing date from 31 March 2005 to 28 February 2007. \n ", "6   \n23.  While the Project covers national roads only, local agencies will be involved in the \ndesign and procurement of the rehabilitation works. Their involvement in the RRSP delayed \nimplementation  because  they  lacked  capacity  and  the  knowledge  of  ADB\u2019s  procurement \nguidelines. They have gained experience over the last 3 years and, with the early support of \nconsultants, should provide the required inputs on time. Implementation workshops will be held \nupon loan effectiveness to update project staff on ADB procedures and policies\u2014procurement \nand safeguard policies in particular. Land acquisition-related delays are unlikely as the works \nare to be carried out within the existing right-of-way. To facilitate the liaison with the executing \nagency and implementing agencies and ensure timely project monitoring by ADB staff, it is \nproposed to have the Project administered by the Indonesian Resident Mission.  \n  \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n24.  The expected impact of the Project is economic growth and improved living conditions in \npoor areas of Sumatra and Kalimantan. The primary outcome is improved vehicular access on \nstrategic national roads. The Project will help reduce transport tariffs, improve road safety, \nreduce  road  deterioration  due  to  overloaded  vehicles,  and  promote  financial  transparency \nthrough improved fiduciary control and anticorruption measures. Combined with other activities \nincluded in the country strategy and program, it will help reduce poverty in project areas. The \nroad sections to be rehabilitated under the Project lie along the strategic trans-island corridors \nlinking producing areas and markets of the two largest islands. The Project will also promote \nregional cooperation as the rehabilitated roads are part of the main interregional routes with the \nneighboring countries.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n25.  The  Project  will  rehabilitate  deteriorated  road  sections  and  replace  bridges  on  the \nstrategic  national  road  networks.  To  ensure  that  benefits  from  road  rehabilitation  are \nsustainable, the Project will address road policy issues by (i) strengthening enforcement of \nvehicle-load regulations, (ii) raising road safety awareness among local communities, and (iii) \ndeveloping new approaches to road maintenance management. It will also provide capacity \nbuilding and training to strengthen capabilities in environmental and social impact management, \nproject management, and engineering support.  \n \n1.  Civil Works: Road and Bridge Rehabilitation  \n26.  The Project will rehabilitate 1,292 km of roads through (i) the reconstruction of 60 km12 \nand resurfacing and widening of 593 km13 of the Trans-Sumatra eastern and central highways, \n(ii) reconstruction of 371 km and resurfacing of 268 km of the Trans-Kalimantan Highway, and \n(iii)  replacement  of  21 timber  and log bridges in  Kalimantan  and  widening  of  19  bridges  in  \n                                                 \n12  Reconstruction (including some new construction) involves improvement, strengthening of pavements and \nshoulders, and surface and subsurface drainage, within the existing right of way. \n13\n   Resurfacing and widening consists of roadway overlays with or without widening, including reshaping or addition \nof shoulders, minor drainage works, and road signage and pavement markings. Natural stone aggregates for \nroad construction are not commonly found in West and Central Kalimantan. A soil-cement base design has been \nproposed for these areas. However, new products are available for road base stabilization, and experiments \nshow they are cost-effective and their strength is comparable to cement. DGH is recommended to test new \nproducts on selected road sections in Kalimantan. \n ", "  7\nSumatra.  The  Project  covers  10  provinces:  Central  Kalimantan,  East  Kalimantan,  South \nKalimantan, West Kalimantan, Jambi, Lampung, North Sumatra, South Sumatra, West Sumatra, \nand Riau. The details of proposed rehabilitation works are in Appendix 5. Once rehabilitated, the \nroads and bridges14 will require routine maintenance.15 The quality and reliability of the routine \nmaintenance will be enhanced through complementary activities under the Project\u2019s capacity-\nbuilding component. Roads will be widened within the existing right-of-way where the road fails \nto meet DGH pavement- and shoulder-width standards. \n \n2.  Support to Road Sector Policies  \n27.  Enforcing  Controls  on  Truck  Overloading.  Given  the  encouraging  results  of  the \nongoing  North  Sumatra  and  Aceh  pilot  initiative  to  prevent  overloading  (para.  12),  the \nGovernment has recommended its extension to other regions. Four new locations have been \nidentified, one in Sumatra and three in Kalimantan, for privately operated weighbridges with \nWIM equipment. The Project will select sites, procure equipment, supervise installation, and \nsupervise  12  months\u2019  implementation  of  the  four  weighbridge  stations.  A  simultaneous \nexperiment on the two islands will enable the Government to better assess the performance of \nthe improved vehicle-load control system.  \n \n28.  Road  Safety  Awareness  Campaign.  Efforts  to  improve  traffic  safety  by  treating \naccident-prone spots, implementing horizontal and vertical signage, and establishing accident \ninvestigation units are ongoing under the World Bank\u2019s funded Sumatra Regional Road Project. \nThe RRSP is providing additional assistance for road safety policies under the Government\u2019s \naction plan. However, these efforts do not address the poor awareness of accident risk among \nchildren and other vulnerable groups in communities near the roads to be rehabilitated. The \nProject will support a road safety awareness campaign in West, Central, and South Kalimantan, \ntargeting vulnerable groups, particularly children and old people living in areas newly exposed to \nhigher traffic volume and speed.  \n \n29.  Developing New Approaches to Road Maintenance Management. To ensure the \nsustainability of investments in road construction and rehabilitation, road maintenance\u2014routine \nand periodic\u2014is essential. Although road maintenance funding is increasing (para. 11), it is still \nlimited. The Project will formulate a new approach to road maintenance management based on \nthe recommendations of a related study financed by JBIC Loan IP-467 (2001).  \n \n3.  Capacity Building and Training \n30.  Project Management and Engineering Support Practices. The training in project \nmanagement and engineering support practices will (i) help train each project province\u2019s P3JJ \nand  government  agency  for  regional  infrastructure  to  execute  and  monitor  national  road \nmaintenance; and (ii) support central DGH\u2019s efforts to provide guidelines, training resources, \nand assistance to regional road agencies in their management of the road network. The teams \nassisting the P3JJ and government agency for regional infrastructure will work directly with their \nstaff in implementing developed or new programs for project management practices, to provide \ntraining in areas that are relevant to the Project and that are Government priorities. The training \nwill cover (i) construction contract law; (ii) landslide control, slope stability, and retaining walls; \n                                                 \n14   Deficient bridge structures will be replaced on road sections selected for reconstruction or resurfacing and/or \nwidening.  \n15    Routine maintenance is required periodically, depending on the traffic and other features of road sections, and is \nto be financed by the Government. \n ", "8   \n(iii) financial management and control; (iv) road and bridge maintenance; and (v) technical \nspecifications in road and bridge works. \n \n31.  Strengthening Capabilities in Environmental and Social Impact Management. The \nProject will provide training in environmental and social impacts for road rehabilitation projects \non the national network. The training will include road planning in accordance with Government \nregulations and donor guidelines on the environment and social development. \n \nC.  Special Features \n32.  To increase project readiness, the consultants recruited under the RRSP were used to \nprepare the Project under advance procurement action. The contract of the RRSP core team of \nconsultants has been amended to incorporate the detailed design and bidding documents for \nthe rehabilitation works scheduled to be implemented in the first year of the Project.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates  \n33.  The project cost is estimated at $215.8 million (Table 1). This includes value-added tax, \nphysical and price contingencies, and capitalized interest and commitment fees charged during \nconstruction. The foreign exchange cost of $76.2 million accounts for 35% of the total cost. The \nlocal currency component of $139.6 million equivalent constitutes the remaining 65%. Detailed \ncost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 6. \n \nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nItem           Foreign  Local  Total \n               Exchange Currency   \nA.

Financing Plan  \n34.  The Government has requested ADB to provide a loan of $151 million to finance 100% \nof the foreign currency costs ($76.2 million equivalent) and 54% of local currency costs ($74.8 \nmillion equivalent). The remaining $64.8 million in local currency costs will be financed by the \nGovernment.  Overall,  the  loan  will  finance  70%  of  the  estimated  project  cost.  Table  2 \nsummarizes  the  project  financing  plan.  The  Government  has  confirmed  that  sufficient \ncounterpart  funds  will  be  included  in  the  2006  national  budget  to  cover  the  first  year  of \n ", "  9\nimplementation. The required counterpart funds will be made available on time for the full \nduration of the Project.  \n \n35.  The ADB loan will be from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. The Borrower will be the \nRepublic of Indonesia. Provided in US dollars, the loan will have a maturity period of 25 years, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, conversion \noptions  that  may  be  exercised  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  loan  regulations  and  conversion \nguidelines, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. Interest \nwill be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for the Government\u2019s \ndecision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were the Government\u2019s own independent \ndecision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice of ADB. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan  \n($ million) \nSource  Foreign  Local  Total  Total Cost \n   Exchange Currency    (%) \nAsian Development Bank (ADB)  76.2  74.8  151.0  70 \nGovernment  0.0  64.8  64.8  30 \nTotal  76.2  139.6  215.8  100 \nSource: ADB estimates.         \n         \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n36.  DGH will be the Executing Agency, responsible for the overall execution of the Project. \nChaired by BAPPENAS, a project steering committee representing BAPPENAS, the Ministry of \nFinance,  MPW,  and  MOC  will  monitor  and  coordinate  project  implementation.  DGH  will \nestablish a project management unit (PMU) headed by a manager with experience in externally \nfinanced projects. Appointed for the duration of the Project, the PMU staff will be responsible for \nthe day-to-day implementation and accountable for technical and financial reporting. The PMU \nhead will ensure compliance with ADB procurement guidelines and ADB safeguard policies. The \nPMU staff will be assisted by experienced engineers, accountants, and other staff as required. \nADB is comfortable with DGH\u2019s capacity and resource management. A core team of consultants \nwill  be  financed  under  the  Project  (para.  45)  and  assist  the  PMU  staff  in  management, \nadministration, monitoring, procurement, and construction supervision. \n \n37.  DGH, DGLC, and BAPPENAS will act as the implementing agencies. Each will appoint \nexperienced project staff members to monitor and follow up the implementation of their project \ncomponents. DGH will implement the road rehabilitation, and capacity-building and training \ncomponents. DGLC will implement the enforcing controls on truck overloading and road safety \nawareness campaign subcomponents of the road sector policy component. BAPPENAS will \nimplement  the  development  of  new  approaches  to  road  maintenance  management \nsubcomponent of the road sector policy component. \n \n38.  Road and bridge rehabilitation works will be executed by contractors in the 10 project \nprovinces, under the supervision and management of the P3JJs, assisted by two field teams of \nconsultants (para. 45), one each in Sumatra and Kalimantan. The P3JJs will be responsible for \n ", "10  \npreconstruction (preparation and acceptance of detailed designs), and procurement committees \nappointed  by  the  project  manager  for  preparation  of  tender  documents  for  ADB  approval, \nprequalification  of  contractors,  arrangement  of  pre-bid  meetings,  evaluation  of  bids,  and \nawarding of contracts related to civil works.  \n \n39.  To strengthen the components for road safety and truck overloading, DGLC will prepare \nand  award  consulting  service  contracts,  minor  civil  works,  weighbridge  WIM  equipment \nprocurement  and  installation,  and  operational  management  contracts.  However,  day-to-day \nmanagement and financial and reporting requirements in selected provinces will be carried out \nthrough DGLC headquarters in Jakarta.  \n \n2.  Project Readiness \n40.  Project readiness requires that the detailed designs of road links must be completed \nbefore implementing the first year\u2019s program. P3JJs, assisted by Government-financed local \nconsultants, are carrying out this task under advance procurement action. The detailed designs \nwill be reviewed by the P3JJs and PMU staff before contract award and implementation. Any \ndesign work for the road links to be rehabilitated in the following years and not completed under \nthe above arrangements will be completed by the field team consultants hired under the Project. \n \n41.  Project management arrangements were put in place before loan negotiations, including \nsenior appointments to the steering committee, the PMU, and the implementing agencies. DGH \nhas assigned a project manager and staff to the PMU. \n \n42.  To  cover  counterpart  expenditure  requirements  for  the  first  year\u2019s  program,  the \nGovernment is required to allocate budgets in FY2006 and sufficient resources to DGH, DGLC, \nand BAPPENAS to implement the civil works and policy components that are expected to start \nby mid-2006. Project-readiness criteria and parties responsible are shown in Appendix 7.  \n \n3.  Implementation Schedule \n43.  The Project will be implemented over 54 months, from January 2006 to June 2010, \nincluding  mobilization  but  excluding  the  defects-liability  period.  A  tentative  implementation \nschedule is in Appendix 8.  \n \n4.  Procurement \n44.  All procurement to be financed from the project loan will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. Contracts valued in excess of $1.0 million for goods and $1.5 \nmillion for civil works will be procured by international competitive bidding, with smaller civil \nworks contracts fulfilled through local competitive bidding. Supply contracts not exceeding $1 \nmillion will be procured through international shopping. However, only international competitive \nbidding  is expected  to  be  used. Equipment  and  spare parts  required  for  the Project,  and \nestimated to costs, in the aggregate, the equivalent of less than $100,000 may be procured \ndirectly  from  the  manufacturers  of  the  original  equipment  or  their  agents.  Prior  to  such \nprocurement, a list of individual items to be procured, an estimate of their costs, an indication of \npotential sources of supply and any related documents shall be submitted to ADB for approval. \nAfter award, three copies of each contract for such items shall be furnished to ADB. To expedite \nprocurement before effectiveness, advance procurement action was approved on 2 April 2004, \nto procure goods, works, and related services up to but not including contract signing. Twenty-\nsix  contract  packages  developed  during  appraisal  will  allow  sufficient  competition  during \n ", "  11\nprocurement, and efficient program implementation. The list of contract package is in Appendix \n5.  During  project  inception,  special  workshops  targeting  staff  at  DGH,  the  PMU,  and  the \nimplementing agencies will be held to update them on ADB\u2019s policies and procedures for \nprocurement and evaluation of proposals and bids. Similar workshops will be held for members \nof procurement committees under the Project. \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n45.  The Project will require 3,598 person-months of consulting services: 274 person-months \nof international consulting and 3,324 person-months of domestic, including (i) a core team of \nconsultants  (109  person-months  international  consulting  and  495  person-months  domestic \nconsulting) to help the PMU supervise the Project; (ii) two field teams of consultants (96 person-\nmonths international and 2,381 person-months domestic) to help PIUs and local government \nagencies supervise contractors implementing the Project; (iii) consultants to enforce controls on \nthe truck overloading subcomponent (24 person-months international and 85 person-months \ndomestic); (iv) consultants to implement the road safety awareness campaigns (102 person-\nmonths,  domestic);  (v)  consultants  to  develop  new  approaches  to  road  maintenance \nmanagement  (40  person-months  international  and  130  person-months  domestic);  (vi) \nconsultants for environmental and social impact management capacity building (5 persons-\nmonths international and 72 person-months domestic); and (vii) capacity-building consultants \n(59  person-months  domestic)  to  provide  training  in  project  management  and  engineering \nsupport practices. All consultants to be financed under the loan will be recruited in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, and ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod will be used and the submission of full technical proposal requested. Detailed terms of \nreference are in Appendixes 9\u201315.  \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n46.  Disbursement will be based on an annual expenditure plan for the project activities that \nwill be consolidated by the PMU and included in DGH\u2019s budgeted list of projects. Budget \npreparation and consolidation will have inputs from defined levels in the project management, \nand will be consistent with the overall project procurement plan, which identifies activities to be \nundertaken by each level of project management. \n \n47.  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2001). The Project will use direct payments, commitment procedure, and an imprest \naccount. The direct payment procedure will be used for payments over $100,000, and the \ncommitment procedure for imports over $100,000. All other payments will be channeled through \nthe imprest account to increase flexibility in project disbursement. \n \n48.  The initial advance to the imprest account will be based on approved contracts and \nplanned expenditures for the first 6 months of the Project. The ceiling on the imprest account \nwill be $1.5 million. The statement of expenditure (SOE) procedure may be used to reimburse \neligible project expenditures and to liquidate or replenish imprest account advances. The SOE \nprocedure is applicable to individual payments not exceeding $100,000 equivalent. Detailed \narrangements to establish the imprest account and SOE procedure will be made in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2001) as amended.  \n \n49.  Sufficient supporting documentation, as defined in the Loan Disbursement Handbook, \nmust be kept at each level of project management to substantiate all expenditures incurred from \n ", "12  \nthe loan proceeds. Staff at DGH, the PMU, and implementing agencies will be trained in ADB\u2019s \ndisbursement procedures. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n50.  The PMU and implementing and other agencies involved in project implementation will \nprepare and maintain accounts exclusively for the Project and will register in such accounts all \nreceipts and payments for the Project in accordance with sound accounting principles and \nprocedures. Annual project accounts will be prepared by one auditing firm acceptable to ADB, \nbased  on  sound  and  acceptable  accounting  principles.  Audited  project  accounts,  audited \nfinancial statements, and the audit opinion must be submitted to ADB within 6 months of the end \nof the financial year and at project completion. The financial statements and the auditor\u2019s report \nwill be in English. The Government and DGH were informed of ADB\u2019s policy on submission of \naudited accounts, which covers failure to submit audited accounts and financial statements on \ntime.  A  formal  warning  will  be  issued  for  accounts  more  than  6  months  overdue,  and \ndisbursements will be suspended for accounts that are 12 months overdue. \n \n51.  An audited opinion of the project accounts will reflect (i) an assessment of the adequacy \nof accounting and internal controls systems with respect to project expenditures and other \nfinancial  transactions  and  to  ensuring  the  safe  custody  of  project  financed  assets;  (ii)  a \ndetermination as to whether the Borrower and project implementing agencies have maintained \nadequate documentation on all relevant transactions, including specific mention of SOE and \nimprest account transactions; (iii) a confirmation that expenditures submitted to ADB are eligible \nfor  financing  and  identification  of  any  ineligible  expenditures;  and  (iv)  a  confirmation  of \ncompliance  with  financial  loan  covenants  and  ADB  requirements  for  project  management. \nUnder Indonesian regulations, the Inspectorate General has to audit the Project\u2019s financial \naccounts and the effectiveness of control mechanisms established within the Project. Copies of \nall such reports will be sent to ADB. \n \n52.  The PMU will be responsible for (i) collecting and consolidating all project progress \nreports, site reports, technical and financial reports, and their submission to ADB; and (ii) \npreparing quarterly progress reports, the midterm project evaluation report, and the overall \nproject completion report. The quarterly reports will be submitted to ADB within 15 days of the \nend  of  each  quarter  due.  The  implementing  agencies  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  preparing \nmonthly and quarterly project progress, technical, and financial reports covering site-specific \nactivities; and (ii) collecting and consolidating field data and feedback from local participating \nagencies and contractors that, in turn, will be relayed to the PMU. Implementing agencies and \nthe PMU will do their accounting and reporting by e-mail. Off-the-shelf databases and other \nsoftware will be used to set up effective and transparent accounting, monitoring, and financial \nreporting systems. The quarterly reports submitted to ADB will be posted on the Project\u2019s \nwebsite, located as a link within the MPW website. \n \n8.  Monitoring and Evaluation of Project Performance and Benefits    \n53.  DGH, DGLC, and ADB have agreed on a set of indicators to monitor and evaluate the \nProject\u2019s performance in relation to its expected impact, outcomes, and outputs. The details of \nthe indicators and baseline values will be established by DGH and DGLC, in consultation with \nADB, and with the assistance of the core team of consultants, at least 2 months before civil \nworks begin in the project provinces. DGH will be responsible for data on (i) average road \nroughness, (ii) classified traffic counts, (iii) annual expenditures on maintenance (routine and \nperiodic) of national roads and bridges, and (iv) social and economic impact indicators. DGLC \n ", "  13\nwill also provide baseline data and be responsible for (i) impact of the road safety awareness \ncampaign on attitudes toward road and pedestrian safety; (ii) truck axle loads, as measured at \nthe four weighbridges and by WIM monitoring equipment; and (iii) average one-way passenger \nfares and freight transport rates for general cargo to and from predetermined points on the \nrehabilitated road corridors. Monitoring indicators will be measured each year and for 3 years \nafter project completion. Each assessment will consist of an evaluation of changes that occurred \nin the preceding year. Comments and findings regarding these project indicators will be included \nin the midterm review. The agreed-on list of indicators is in Appendix 16.  \n \n9.  Project Review \n54.  ADB will carry out regular loan reviews and a midterm review of the Project around \n2008, as to be agreed on between the DGH, the implementing agencies, and ADB. This will \nfocus  on  project  impacts,  particularly  relating  to  institutional,  administrative,  organizational, \ntechnical, environmental, and social aspects. The Project\u2019s economic viability and other aspects \nthat may have an impact on project performance will be reassessed during this review. The \nreview will also examine compliance with covenants specified in the loan agreement. The EA \nand the implementing agencies will make sure that their staff visit the field frequently and join \nADB for all project review missions. \n \n10.  Anticorruption Measures \n55.  Following  governance  issues  in  2003  under  an  ADB-assisted  project  with  the  then \nDirectorate General of Urban and Rural Development, of the then Ministry of Settlement and \nRegional Infrastructure (MPW now), the Government and ADB jointly addressed weaknesses \nand defined remedial actions to improve project implementation. A TA was implemented16 and \nproposed a number of measures to broaden the mandate of the inspector general to make it a \nmore effective internal auditor instead of just an auditor of the financial accounts. The TA \nresulted in the signing of an action plan for controlling fraud and corruption between ADB and \nthe directorate. A similar action plan was developed under the Project between ADB and DGH. \nThe  action  plan  targets  the  functioning  of  regional  governments  and  DGH,  but  also  the \nperformance of auditors, consultants, and contractors, as well as ADB\u2019s project implementation. \nRegarding the recruitment of observers for procurement as required by the action plan, ADB will \nguide  DGH  based  on  its  experience  of  Sustainable  Capacity  Building  for  Decentralization \nProject.17 The attached action plan matrix (Appendix 17) summarizes the agreement reached \nbetween ADB and DGH. \n \n56.  ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to the Government. The policy, together with \nother ADB safeguard policies, will be included in the training provided to DGH, the PMU, and \nimplementing  agency  staff.  The  Government  is  committed  to  creating  and  sustaining  a \ncorruption-free environment, and has agreed to abide by the relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s \nanticorruption  policy  during  project  implementation.  A  new  anticorruption  law  gives  the \nGovernment strengthened legal powers of investigation and enforcement in cases of corruption. \nFinally, provisions will be included in all contracts to specify the right of ADB to audit the \naccounts of contractors, suppliers, and service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n                                                 \n16    ADB. 2002.

Manila. \n ", "14  \n57.  Following the experience of the RRSP, the procedures for submitting and approving \nwork variation orders have been streamlined in consultation with the Government. Adoption of \ndetailed  design  procedures  instead  of  a  simplified  design  procedure  will  help  reduce  the \nprobability of fraud and corruption in procurement. The Government has agreed to improve \ntransparency and accountability by keeping better records of the procurement process to ensure \ncompliance with procedures. \n \n58.  Poor-quality work as a result of corruption is a major issue. Substantial emphasis was \ntherefore  placed  on  improving  quality  control  by  (i)  strengthening  construction  supervision \nthrough specific additional powers and authority to reject defective works and by disapproving \nrelated payment requests, (ii) conducting independent technical audits through the core team of \nconsultants, (iii) training all professional construction supervision staff in quality control aspects \nbefore their mobilization, and (iv) promoting awareness of quality control at all times during \nimplementation. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic Benefits \n59.  The main benefits will be from motorized vehicle through vehicle operating cost savings \nresulting from reduced road roughness and better vehicle running conditions. Road roughness \naffects vehicle speeds and consumption of fuel, oil, and tires. On selected routes, people who \ncurrently travel by river would benefit from the improved roads. The cost difference reflects the \ndiverted traffic benefits and has been included in the economic analysis. \n \n60.  The Project will generate nonquantifiable economic and social benefits. Better roads will \nlikely attract additional economic activity and traffic, thus generating benefits to a wider circle of \nbeneficiaries. The incomes and well-being of people living near the roads will rise as a result of \nbetter access to social services, markets, and jobs, especially in agriculture, the main source of \nlivelihood.  \n \n61.  The methodology, assumptions, and results of the economic evaluation are summarized \nin Appendix 18. The Project\u2019s overall economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was estimated at \n25.2%.  The  average  EIRR  for  subproject  links  in  Sumatra  (32.4%)  is  higher  than  that  in \nKalimantan (13.4%) because of higher levels of traffic in Sumatra. However, nonquantifiable \nbenefits are substantial in Kalimantan. \n \n62.  The EIRRs of road links in Sumatra range from 10.3% to 50.2%. The road link in West \nSumatra with the lowest estimated EIRR was still economically and socially justified since it (i) \nwould provide a better access to health care facilities, schools, and markets; and (ii) could help \npromote the region\u2019s industries related to palm oil, thus generating local benefits. \n \n63.  The EIRRs of road links in Kalimantan range from 10.4% to 23.6%. The three road links \nin West, Central, and East Kalimantan, with an EIRR of about 10%, were still economically and \nsocially justified as (i) providing vital connections to health care facilities, schools, and markets; \n(ii) being part of the Government\u2019s broader strategies for developing strategic corridors to link \nkey population centers to facilitate trade; and (iii) being of strategic importance as part of the \ncross-border ASEAN Highway connecting East Kalimantan and Sabah in Malaysia. \n \n ", "  15\nB.  Social Dimensions and Poverty Reduction Impacts \n1.  Poverty Reduction \n64.  The  Project\u2019s  poverty  reduction  impacts  are  distinctly  different  in  Sumatra  and \nKalimantan. The Sumatra network carries goods and people over long distances between \nSumatra and Java, as well as interregional traffic, and, to a lesser extent, local traffic. The road \nalso facilitates movements of goods between Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. Much of the \ntraffic flow is agricultural commodities for export coming from poor areas. The national road \nnetwork also delivers processed goods from urban to rural markets in poor areas. In Sumatra, \nthe road network is well established and the Project is intended to prevent further deterioration \nand loss of access. \n \n65.  In  Kalimantan,  where  the  road  network  is  still  limited  and  where  trade  is  largely \nconducted  along  riverways,  upgrading  the  national  road  system  will  promote  interregional \nlinkages, and provide an alternate mode of transportation for poor and remote communities. A \nshift from river- to road-based transport will reduce costs, promotes year-round access, and \nincreases the potential for small- and medium-scale entrepreneurs to make use of the area\u2019s \nnatural resources. Improved road access will facilitate government administration and social \nservice delivery. \n \n66.  Construction will create temporary jobs, and routine maintenance will employ unskilled \nand  semiskilled  workers.  Women  will  be  encouraged  to  work  and  be  treated  equitably.  A \nsummary poverty reduction and social analysis is in Appendix 19. \n \n2.  Safety, Health, and Gender Concerns \n67.  The  Project  will  have  few  adverse  social  impacts.  ADB  and  the  Government  have \nagreed that the Project should have an HIV/AIDS18 prevention initiative targeting construction \nworkers and the people they interact with, specifically addressing the disproportionate impact of \nHIV/AIDS on women, who are more vulnerable than men. The Project will involve about 30,000 \npeople, mostly young men from Java, coming to live in base camps along the approximately \n1,300  km  project  corridors.  Because  of  extraordinarily  low  levels  of  condom  use  among \nIndonesian men, the risk of spreading HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) \nto  workers  and  into  local  communities  is  high.  The  Government  is  undertaking  HIV/AIDS \nawareness  campaigns  through  programs  targeting  groups  at  risk.  To  mitigate  these  risks, \nconstruction  contracts  will  require  contractors  to  allow  their  workers  to  attend  education \nsessions where materials such as condoms and awareness brochures will be distributed. An \nHIV/AIDS  prevention  initiative  through  a  TA independent  of  this loan  is  under processing, \nincluding  two  relevant  components:  (i)  information  and  education  campaigns  to  prevent \nHIV/AIDS and STDs for workers and communities surrounding the project base camps, and (ii) \ncapacity  building  of  local  HIV/AIDS  civil-society  institutions.  The  TA  will  work  with  other \ninitiatives such as those financed by the United States Agency for International Development \n(USAID) and the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), focusing on sex \nworkers and preventing human trafficking. \n \n                                                 \n18  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n ", "16  \n3.  Involuntary Resettlement  \n68.  Project road alignments follow the existing centerline and remain within the existing \nrights-of-way. Pavement and shoulder widening will remain within the existing right-of-way in all \ncases. Surveys determined that the Project would not require land acquisition or resettlement or \nharm adjacent property, or religious, cultural, or historical sites. However, in the unlikely event \nthat minor land acquisition might be necessary following detailed design, DGH has prepared the \nCompensation Policy Framework and Procedure Guidelines (CPFPG) to codify procedures for \nverifying road works impacts, deciding compensation eligibility and entitlements, undertaking \nand  monitoring  resettlement  and  compensation,  and  providing  redress  for  complaints  or \ngrievances.  In  case  of  discrepancies  between  the  Government\u2019s  laws,  regulations  and \nprocedures, and ADB\u2019s requirements, or if there is an omission in CPFPG or a discrepancy with \nthe ADB\u2019s requirements, then DGH and ADB will agree upon a resolution. \n \n4.  Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Policy \n69.  Some roads in Kalimantan will cross areas inhabited by indigenous peoples, who should \nnot be affected as project road alignments remain within existing rights-of-way. If minimal and \nscattered impacts arise from detail design modifications and if, after review, ADB decides to \nproceed with the planned improvement activities, project-affected indigenous peoples will be \ncompensated under the CPFPG. No systemic socioeconomic or cultural impact on indigenous \npeoples  that  would  trigger  the  preparation  of  indigenous  peoples  development  plans  is \nforeseen. Consultations with indigenous peoples indicate that they do not consider the expected \nrise  in  economic  activity  or  traffic  an  issue  of  conflict  or  competition  that  would  require \nmitigation. \n \nC.  Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n70.  The Project is classified under environmental category B (sensitive). Initial environmental \nexaminations (IEEs), public consultations, and summary IEE reports have been prepared in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s environment policy and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). \nThe IEEs indicate no major adverse environmental impacts. The Project involves rehabilitating \nexisting roads on existing alignments and within existing rights-of-way, with no additional land \nacquisition. The summary IEE was posted on ADB\u2019s website in June 2004. Potential adverse \nimpacts are minor, localized, and temporary, and will receive mitigation and monitoring under \nthe Project. \n \n71.  ADB shares the Government\u2019s concern regarding illegal logging. During the feasibility \nstudy, impacts of road rehabilitation on protected areas and on forests were analyzed. For \nprotected areas, the analysis concluded that buffer zones were sufficient to protect rare habitats \nand that adequate management controls were in place. The study concluded that there would \nbe  no  significant  adverse  impacts  on  protected  areas,  specifically  the  Rimbo  Panti  nature \nreserve in West Sumatra.  \n \n72.  As there are no productive forest and commercial logging operations in the project \nareas, two scenarios for illegal logging are possible: (i) local, small-scale felling and utilization of \ntimber,  to  build  houses,  with  no  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts;  and  (ii)  local \nexploitation of timber for small-scale commercial purposes, possibly in West Kalimantan. \n \n73.  Based on the field observations as well as discussions with local forest management \nauthorities and legal loggers, the Project was determined to have little or no impact on the scale \n ", "  17\nor intensity of illegal logging. Rather, the rehabilitation of road links will make forest patrol easier \nand more efficient, improving control over illegal activities.  \n \n74.  The Project\u2019s environmental mitigation measures may include (i) slope stabilization and \nprotection to reduce the risk of failure and to protect watercourses; (ii) protection from landslides \nby retaining structures; (iii) proper drainage,19 with cross-falls in each pavement layer and cross- \nand side-drains designed to cope with expected flows; (iv) preservation of protected areas \nthrough road signs, roadside warnings, and protective fencing; (v) incorporating safety features \nin  engineering  designs;  (vi)  protecting  communities  from  project  activities  through  close \nconsultation  with  community  leaders  and  those  affected,  providing  advance  notice  of \nconstruction schedules, and adopting a code of conduct for worker behavior; and (vii) recycling \nconstruction materials, e.g., by using reclaimed asphalt in cold mixes or aggregates in surface \nmaterial. In addition to cost savings, positive environmental impacts will be reduced need for \nquarrying, reduced dumping of waste, and reduced impact on air quality. \n \nD.  Project Risks \n75.

ASSURANCES \n76.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  DGH  and  the  Government  have  given  the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The Government will ensure that implementation arrangements of the Project, \nthe provision of funds from loan proceeds, and the corresponding counterpart \ngovernment contributions necessary for financing project activities are provided \nin  a  timely  fashion  throughout  project  implementation,  including  required \nexpenditures for operation and management of weighbridges, in the manner \nagreed with ADB. \n(ii)  The  Government  and  DGH  will  ensure  that  the  fiduciary  control,  fraud,  and \nanticorruption action plan is fully implemented as agreed. \n(iii)  The Government, through DGH, will establish baseline values at least 2 months \nprior to commencement of civil works in project provinces, for performance and \nbenefit monitoring purposes, as to be agreed with ADB, and monitoring indicators \nwill be measured each year and for 3 years after project completion. \n(iv)  The  Government  will  submit  quarterly  project  progress  reports  and  progress \nreports to ADB periodically on the revised PSAP and consult with ADB on further \nroad sector policy measures, if and when available. \n(v)  The  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  all  transport  sector  and  road \nsubsector studies undertaken in Indonesia and will provide ADB with copies of all \navailable documents relevant to such studies, including consultants\u2019 reports, and \nwill ensure that ADB has the opportunity to comment on the recommendations \ncontained therein. \n(vi)  The  Government  will  assure  ADB  of  availability  of  funding  for  regular \nmaintenance and implementation, as required, of the national roads rehabilitated \nunder the Project. Furthermore, DGH will ensure that annual road maintenance \nplans are prepared for the improved roads on the basis of the agreed-upon \nmaintenance standards, traffic volumes, and assessment of needs. \n(vii)  DGH will ensure that road safety measures identified as needed during project \npreparation\u2014including guardrails, road markings, and warning signs\u2014and staff \ntraining in road safety and traffic engineering are incorporated in final designs for \nproject-funded civil works and are implemented in accordance with designs. \n(viii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  Project  activities  will  comply  with \nGovernment laws and regulations governing environmental and social impact \nassessment, ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and all actions identified on SIEE \nand IEE will be implemented. The contract documents for all civil works under the \nProject will include specific measures as indicated in the SIEE and IEEs to \nmitigate negative environmental impacts caused by Project activities. Adequate \nenvironmental  management  plan  and  environmental  monitoring  plan  will  be \nimplemented. The contractors engaged under the civil works contracts will be \nrequired to comply strictly with all environmental impact mitigation requirements \nto  be  set  out  in  the  contract  documents,  and  the  consultants  engaged  for \nconstruction supervision to monitor closely the compliance by the contractors \nwith the environmental impact mitigation requirements. Semi-annual reports on \nimplementation of the Environmental Monitoring Program as stated in the IEEs \nwill be submitted to ADB. \n(ix)  For project roads that pass through Rimbo Panti nature reserve, the Government \nwill ensure that a monitoring program is in place and mitigation measures be \nimplemented as per the bidding documents. \n ", "  19\n(x)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  civil  works  contractors  comply  with  all \napplicable laws related to gender, labor, and workers\u2019 safety, including ensuring \nthat women are given equal pay for work that is equal to men. \n(xi)  DGH  will  ensure  that  civil  works  contracts  will  include  appropriate  clauses \nrequiring  contractors  to  allow  their  workers  to  attend  planned  campaigns  on \nSTDs and HIV/AIDS during construction and will maintain adequate sanitation \nand working conditions.  \n(xii)  DGH will ensure that adequate drainage of project roadways is provided by \nappropriate design and implementation of cross-falls, shoulder grading, cross-\ndrains, culverts, and side-ditches. \n(xiii)  In the event land acquisition or resettlement is needed, the Government will \nensure that a Resettlement Plan will be prepared for approval by ADB.

All national and provincial roads are part of the primary network \nand are functionally classified as arterial or collector roads. \n \n          Table A2: Length of Public Roads, by Regiona \n(kilometers)\nRegion Nationalb Provincialc Districtd Municipald Total Percent Villagee\nSumatra 8,208.0 18,189.0 75,470.0 7,106.0 108,973.0 33.6 52,169.0\nJava 4,561.0 9,179.0 60,445.0 9,714.0 83,899.0 25.8 68,207.0\nKalimantan 5,182.0 6,202.0 20,560.0 1,307.0 33,251.0 10.3 45,786.0\nBali/Nusa Tenggara 2,213.0 5,767.0 20,507.0 1,020.0 29,507.0 9.1 54,304.0\nSulawesi 5,336.0 7,887.0 32,028.0 2,019.0 47,270.0 14.6 17,969.0\nMaluku/Papua 2,168.0 4,414.0 14,308.0 360.0 21,250.0 6.6 5,391.0\nTotal 27,668.0 51,638.0 223,318.0 21,526.0 324,150.0 100.0 243,826.0\nPercent                8.5             15.9          68.9           6.6         100.0\nBPS = Central Bureau of Statistics, DGH = Directorate General of Highway, IIRMS = Indonesian \nintegrated road management system, IRMS = inter-urban road management system, km = kilometer.\na Excluding tollroads. 2002 except where stated.\nb 2002 data from IRMS; excludes tollroads. \nc 2002 data from IRMS; includes 597 kilometers (km) of district/municipal and 30 km of unclassified road in IRMS database\n   to be reclassified as provincial roads.\nd 2000 data from DGH.\ne Approximate length of village/desa roads outside IIRMS.\nSource: Directorate General of Highway, inter-urban road management system, and Central Bureau of Statistics.\n \n \n \n ", "   \nSECTOR ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK\nLower economic \ngrowth and \nincreased poverty\nIncreased costs of  Reduced mobility and  Ineffective \nRoad safety \nbasic commodities  accessibility to economic  enforcement and \ncompromised\nand travel and welfare opportunities lack of governance\nHigher transport \nprices charged by \noperators\nIncreased  Lower vehicle speed  Roads impassable in \nIncrease vehicle  Loss of income and  Emotional trauma \nconsumption of fuel,  and increased travel  rainy conditions, and \nwear and tear productivity and loss of life\noil, tires, etc. time truck overloading\nImpacts\nKey Sector  Inefficient road\nBadly deteriorated  High levels of traffic \nProblems transport \nnational roads accidents\noperations\nCauses\nUnnecessary Inefficient vehicle  High truck axle  Poor quality road  Poor vehicle  Poor standards of  Limited community \nrestrictions on  fleet loads design, construction,  safety standards driver education,  road safety \noperations and tariffs and maintenance training, and testing awareness\nInappropriate  Ineffective  Limited capacity of  Ineffective enforcement  Inadequate safety \nstructure of road  enforcement of  road management  of vehicle and driver  awareness  Ap\nuser charges axle-load limits institutions safety standards education p\ne\nn\nd\nInadequate  Inadequate and  Shortcomings in  ix\nfunding of  unreliable funding of  technical guidelines,   3\n \nenforcement road management support, and training\nCorruption and  Insufficient funding  2\nContributing factors addressed by  illegal levies for road  3\nproposed project components maintenance\n \n ", "24  Appendix 4 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ROADS SECTOR \nTable A4.1: Asian Development Bank Loans \nNo.  Project  Approved  Approval  Completion  PCR Date  PPAR Date  \nAmount  Date  Date  and Rating  and Rating \n($ million) \nA.

General \n1.  An economic analysis was carried out comparing with- and without-project scenarios. \nThe Project includes components to rehabilitate deteriorated road links and replace bridges on \nthe  strategic  national  road  networks  of  Sumatra  and  Kalimantan,  followed  by  routine  and \nperiodic maintenance. The base case reflects expected conditions in the absence of the Project, \nwith maintenance sufficient only to hold the road in its present condition. The project case \ninvolves initial rehabilitation followed by routine and periodic maintenance, but with expenditure \nand frequency of periodic maintenance economically optimum for predicted road conditions and \ntraffic flows. \n \n2.  The analysis was conducted by using the integrated road management system (IRMS), \ndeveloped by the Directorate General of Infrastructure (DGH), which was basically derived from \nthe highway design module (HDM) relationships calibrated for Indonesian conditions. The IRMS \neconomic review module (ERM) produced predicted traffic flow, classified vehicle operating \ncosts  (VOC)  in  economic  prices,  predicted  average  travel  speed,  predicted  pavement \nroughness, agency costs, and road user costs. ERM also calculated the economic viability of \nthe road links. The ERM output was modified to accommodate estimated non-VOC savings. \n \n3.  IRMS contains comprehensive inventories and databases of road and bridge conditions. \nDuring project preparation, data such as road inventory, condition, and traffic were reviewed by \nfield surveys and adjusted where necessary to reflect the real situation. All costs and benefits \nwere expressed in constant mid 2005 prices. The economic analysis covers the construction \nperiod of 2006\u20132010 plus 20 years of operation and maintenance. \n \n4.  Economic analysis was conducted using domestic prices. A standard exchange rate \nfactor (SERF) of 1.0131 was applied to calculate the economic price of tradable goods. The \nshadow wage rates for skilled and unskilled labor were estimated at 0.95 and 0.6, respectively. \nThe shadow wage rate factors were estimated by comparing the average labor wage in the \nregion and the project labor wage, taking into consideration the existing unemployment rate. \n \nB.  Traffic Forecasts \n5.  The standard 4-stage inter-regional transport demand model for the Transport Sector \nStrategy Study (TSSS)2 validated traffic forecasts produced by IRMS. The estimated base-year \nannual average daily traffic (AADT) for each link is presented in the Table A18.2.   \n \n6.  IRMS predicted the future traffic flow for each link using different traffic growth rates for \nevery province over the 20-year planning horizon. The average traffic growth rates vary from 3 \nto 9% per year for roads in Sumatra and 3 to 5% per year for roads in Kalimantan. \n \n                                                 \n \n1  A simple trade-weight formula was used to estimate the standard exchange rate factor (SERF) using the 2003 net \ninternational trade taxes and total trade data for Indonesia. As the SERF may be too low, the sensitivity analysis \nwill test other values. \n2  ADB. 2000. The Transport Sector Strategy Study for Indonesia. Manila. \n ", "  Ap pendix 18  53    \nC.  Costs \n7.  Project costs include road rehabilitation and maintenance. IRMS holds information on a \nbase set of unit costs for a detailed list of work items, together with provincial factors applicable \nto each item to account for regional differences in unit rates. The unit costs assembled over a \nperiod and used in DGH\u2019s planning, programming, and budgeting were reviewed during project \npreparation and adjusted with relevant provincial cost factors. \n \n8.  The  economic  costs  were  estimated  based  on  financial  costs  including  physical \ncontingencies.  Price  escalation  contingencies,  interest  during  construction,  and  taxes  were \nexcluded. Financial costs were converted into economic costs using a specific conversion factor \nfor civil works of 0.97.3 \n \nD.  Economic Benefits \n1.  Description of the Project Benefits \n9.  The main user benefits are in the form of VOC savings resulting from reduced road \nroughness and better vehicle running conditions. Road roughness affects vehicle speeds and \nconsumption of fuel, oil, and tires. People who currently travel by river would benefit from the \nimproved road. The cost difference of traveling by river and road reflects the diverted traffic \nbenefits. These savings to diverted traffic have also been included in the benefit stream. \n \n10.  The Project will generate nonquantifiable economic and social benefits. Better road \nconditions would likely attract additional economic activity and more traffic, spreading benefits \namong a wider group. Generated traffic was considered for selected links serving relatively \nundeveloped areas with the potential for attracting development. Additional income is also \nexpected for people living near the roads because of better access to markets and jobs. \n \n11.  The Project will provide better support for agriculture, the most important source of \nlivelihood for the population living along the road. It would also perform a critical role in providing \nbetter access to public and social services. \n \n2.  Vehicle Operating Cost Savings \n12.  VOC  savings  for  normal  traffic  in  economic  prices  were  calculated  by  using  ERM. \nNormal traffic was assumed to constitute the main category of user benefits for the well-\nestablished routes in Sumatra and Kalimantan proposed for rehabilitation under the Project. For \nthese links, rehabilitation represents an intervention in the normal pattern of deterioration and \nrepair.

VOC, calculated for each of ten classes of vehicles,4 varies with the road roughness \nmeasured  in  international  roughness  index  (IRI)  units,  which  depends  on  the  pattern  of \npavement deterioration, pavement strength, traffic load, and maintenance. It affects vehicle \nspeed and consumption of fuel, oil, and tires.  \n                                                 \n \n3  The road work costs were broken down into the following categories: 34% tradable goods, 44% nontradable goods, \n16% skilled labor, and 6% unskilled labor.  \n4  Passenger cars, light passenger vehicle, light goods vehicle, small buses, large buses, light trucks, medium trucks, \nheavy trucks, articulated trucks, and motorcycles. \n ", "54  Appendix 18 \n3.  Diverted Traffic Benefits \n14.  The river systems constitute the main transport arteries in West and Central Kalimantan. \nThey  run  east-to-west  in  West  Kalimantan  (to  the  port  at  Ketapang  and  then  by  sea  to \nPontianak or Java) and north-to-south in Central Kalimantan (to Pangkalanbun) and are mostly \nperpendicular  to  the  proposed  road  subproject  links.  Most  settlements  are  along  the  river \ncourses. The roads are relatively new and have not yet attracted significant development other \nthan rubber plantations in West Kalimantan, and oil palm plantations in Central Kalimantan. \nWhen the road is improved, it will cut the average transport time from Balaiberkuak and Aur \nKuning to Tayan (West Kalimantan) by up to 75% and from Kudangan to Simpang Runtu \n(Central Kalimantan) by up to 45%. This will help increase the availability of road transport and \nattract traffic that otherwise would have continued to travel by river. \n \n15.  Transport cost savings between road and river were used in estimating the annual \nbenefits accruing to diverted traffic in West and East Kalimantan, respectively. The costs of the \nriver transport were estimated from the responses of individuals interviewed in the social impact \nsurveys. The estimated costs by road are based on the VOC calculated by IRMS, while the \nnumber of households affected was estimated from village census data. The river transport \ncosts were not shadow priced since most of the cost components were non-tradable goods. \n \n16.  The benefits associated with diverted traffic to isolated communities are only significant \nfor the links in West and Central Kalimantan for which they are assumed to apply (Table A18.1). \n \nTable A18.1: Composition of Benefits for Isolated Links in West and Central Kalimantan \n         \nProvince  Link     Proportion of Benefits (%) \n      Savings to  Savings to \n         Normal Traffic  Diverted Traffic\n30-West Kalimantan  079-1 Tayan-Teraju   25   75 \n  079-2 Teraju-Balaiberkuak   59   41 \n   079-3 Balaiberkuak-Aur Kuning   80   20 \n32-Central Kalimantan  024-1 Runtu-Simpang Runtu   43   57 \n  024-2 Kujan-Runtu   84   16 \n  024-3 Penopa-Kujan   92    8 \n   024-4 Kudangan-Penopa  100    0 \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Results of Economic Evaluation \n17.  The economic evaluation produced an overall project\u2019s economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR) of 25.2% (Table A18.3). As expected, the average EIRR for subproject links in Sumatra \n(32.4%) is higher than that in Kalimantan (13.4%) because of its higher traffic level. \n \n18.  At disaggregate level, the EIRRs of road links in Sumatra range from 10.3 to 50.2%. \nEIRR of one road link subproject in West Sumatra estimated at about 10% was economically \njustified since it (i) would provide a better access to social services such as health care centers, \nschools, and markets; and (ii) could contribute to promoting palm-oil-related industries in the \nregion and provide local benefits to the rest of society.  \n \n19.  The EIRRs of road links subprojects in Kalimantan varied from 10.4 to 23.6%. EIRRs of \nthree road subprojects in West, Central, and East Kalimantan that were estimated at about 10% \n ", "  Ap pendix 18  55    \nwere economically justified since they (i) would provide vital connectivity to health care centers, \nschools, and markets; (ii) are part of the Government\u2019s broader strategy of developing strategic \ncorridors to link key population centers to facilitate trade; and (iii) are strategically important to \nthe cross-border and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Highways connecting \nEast Kalimantan and Sabah in Malaysia.  \n \nF.  Sensitivity Analysis \n20.  A sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the impact of changes on key parameters \ndetermining project costs and benefits. The switching values for the road construction and \nmaintenance costs (road agency costs) and traffic volume are 2.4 and 0.4, respectively. The \noverall EIRR will decline from 26.2 to the cutoff level of 12% when either the agency costs \nincrease by about 2.4 times or the traffic level reduces by about 0.4 times of the current level. \nThis condition seems unlikely to happen.   \n \n21.  Given that the EIRRs are greatly varied across subproject links it is worth looking into \nthe impact of the various cost and traffic level on the economic feasibility of subproject links in \nKalimantan and Sumatra. \n \n22.  The road agency cost increase of 10% in Kalimantan will reduce the average EIRR from \n13.5 to 12.1% for all subprojects in Kalimantan. Meanwhile, the average decrease in traffic by \n10%  would  bring  down  the  average  EIRR  from  13.5  to  12%  for  overall  subprojects  in \nKalimantan.  The road agency cost increase of 10% or traffic level decrease of 10% would bring \ndown the EIRR of three subproject links to about 10%. \n \n23.  Either the road agency cost increase of 10% or traffic level decrease of 10% in Sumatra \nwould  bring  down  the  average  EIRR  from  32.4  to  30.2%  for  all  subprojects  in  Sumatra.  \nHowever, either the road agency cost increase of 10% or traffic level decrease of 10% would \nbring down the EIRR of two subproject links in West Sumatra to about 10%. \n \n24.  A sensitivity test was also conducted to assess the impact of different SERF values on \nthe overall EIRR. SERF values of 1.10 and 1.15 were introduced in the economic analysis and \nbrought down the overall EIRR from 25.2 to 24.6% and 24.3%, respectively. This test resulted in \nthe average EIRR of more than 12% for all subprojects in Kalimantan and Sumatra. \n \n25.  The sensitivity test concluded that the Project is still economically justified under various \ncost, traffic, and SERF scenarios. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "56  Appendix 18 \nTable A18.2: Results of the Economic Evaluation \nNo Province Link Road Link Est. 2004 EIRR NPV\nAADT (% p.a.)

Nonquantifiable Benefits \n26.  Induced  Development.  For  selected  links  in  West  Kalimantan  (Tayan-Teraju-\nBalaiberkuak-Aur  Kuning)  and  Central  Kalimantan  (Simpang  Runtu-Runtu-Kujan-Penopa-\nKudangan)  serving  relatively  undeveloped  areas,  road  rehabilitation  will  result  in  a  more \nsignificant change in road conditions and reliability of transport services. This might attract \ninward investment and migration and generate additional traffic.  \n \n27.  Income Growth. In relatively undeveloped areas of Kalimantan with poor access to \nmarkets, jobs, and government services, longer-term income and welfare gains will result from \nimproved access. These are in addition to the direct savings to normal and generated traffic and \narise largely from improvements in the range and quality of the opportunities available at the trip \ndestination. These are difficult to measure, but evidence showed a strong relationship between \nhousehold expenditure and access to opportunities available at provincial centers.  \n \n28.  Support to Agriculture. The road networks provide support to agriculture, the most \nimportant  source  of  livelihood  for  people  living  along  the  roads.  In  most  of  Sumatra  and \nKalimantan, farmers are self-employed small-holders involved in cash crops such as coffee, \ncoconuts, and rubber. Road quality therefore has a direct impact on household income. Good \nroads reduce transportation costs and improve access to markets, increase competition, and \nraise farm-gate prices. Poor roads also lead to higher prices for consumer goods and lower \npurchasing power. \n \n29.  Improve Access to Social Services. The road network also performs a critical role in \nallowing access to many public and social services in both Sumatra and Kalimantan. For \nexample, junior high school students from 27 out of 130 villages located around the Sidempuan-\nBts. Tapanuli road link travel 10\u201330 kilometers to their school. Senior high school students \ntravel 10-20 kilometers to reach their school. Assuming that 20% of all junior and 50% of senior \nhigh school students travel significant distances on the national road to go to school, the \nproposed road links provide better school access for more than 10,000 junior and 16,000 senior \nhigh school students. \n \n30.  The proposed road links also facilitate access to medical services. Access to polyclinics \nand health centers involves road travel in Sumatra and slow and expensive river travel in \nKalimantan. For around half of the Sungai Loban subdistrict population, located along the \nPagatan-Batulicin link in Kalimantan, the nearest hospital and/or modern maternity service is \nmore than 20 kilometers away. For many households living on the Teraju-Balaiberkuak road link \nin Kalimantan, hospitals are more than 100 kilometers away. Village heads in this area describe \ntravel to medical facilities as very difficult. The journey to Sanggau includes a ferry crossing of \nthe  Kapuas  River  without  reliable  connecting  transport.  All-weather,  surfaced  roads  are \nessential in maintaining access to health facilities.  \n \n ", "58  Appendix 19 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \nA.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Indonesia: \n \nIndonesia\u2019s poverty incidence was about 23% (about 48 million people) in 1998, then declined to about 18% (about 38 \nmillion) in 2002, according to the National Socioeconomic Survey (BPS SUSENAS).1 Regional variations are sharp: \npoverty is more common in rural areas than in urban centers, and in the project area, it varies from 18% in Riau to \n42% in South Sumatra, and 30% in South Kalimantan to 57% in Central Kalimantan. \n \nRural local surplus and urban consumer goods are hauled on national roads. National roads are the arteries of trade \nand commerce and enable the economy of the poor to grow.  Agriculture products result from the labor of the poor \nwho themselves rely on basic commodities hauled in from cities.  The Indonesia Poverty Assessment2 notes that \nincreasing the productivity of agriculture requires improved infrastructure including transport, which will reduce \nregional disparity and rural poverty over the medium term. The transportation sector itself also provides a step up and \nout of the grinding poverty of farm labor. Adequate infrastructure is an underpinning to the success and expansion of \nsmall and medium enterprises with their deep backward linkages to the goods and services provided by the poor. \nNational infrastructure is also important to breaking relative isolation and promoting delivery of government \nadministration and social services.  The Government White Paper3 identifies the infrastructure backlog as a key \nbottleneck to poverty reduction. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe Project\u2019s poverty reduction impacts are distinctly different in Sumatra and Kalimantan. The Sumatra network \ncarries goods and people over long distances between Sumatra and Java, as well as interregional traffic, and, to a \nlesser extent, local traffic. The road also facilitates movements of goods between Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. \nMuch of the traffic flow is agricultural commodities for export coming from poor areas. The national road network also \ndelivers processed goods from urban to rural markets in poor areas. \n \nIn Sumatra, the road network is well established and the Project is intended to prevent further deterioration and loss of \naccess. In Kalimantan, where the road network is still limited and where trade is largely conducted along riverways, \nupgrading the national road system will promote interregional linkages, and provide an alternate mode of \ntransportation for poor and remote communities. In both Sumatra and Kalimantan, the poverty reduction impact lies in \nreducing vulnerability to poverty and removing lack of access as a binding constraint for regional economic activities \nthat is essential in fueling economic growth. The Trans-Sumatra and Trans-Kalimantan corridors are not exceptionally \npoor. The road networks also provide access to support the agriculture sector which is the most important source of \nlivelihood. In most of Sumatra and Kalimantan, farmers are self-employed small-holders involved in estate crops.  \nGood roads reduce transportation costs and improve access to market, competition, and higher farm gate prices. The \ncondition of the road also has an impact on household expenditures.  Poor road quality leads to higher prices of \nconsumption goods and lower purchasing power. A shift from river to road based transport reduces costs, promotes \nyear-round access, and increases the potential for small and medium scale entrepreneurs to make use of the natural \nresource potential of the area.  Similarly, improved road access facilitates delivery of government administrative and \nsocial services.  \n \nThe road network provides access to essential public and social services. Roughly 20% of all junior secondary and \n50% of senior secondary students in the corridors use the national road to go to school, the proposed road links \nprotect the access of more than 10,000 junior secondary and 16,000 senior secondary students. An all-weather \nsurfaced roads is essential in enabling residents to reach polyclinics and health centers that are generally located in \nsubdistrict capitals. It is also critical in achieving the Millennium Development Goal targets to reduce infant and child \nand maternal mortality among the nearly 93,000 children under five and more than 100,000 women with potential \nhigh-risk pregnancies living along the road links. \n \n                                                 \n \n1  Excludes Papua and Aceh. \n2  November 2000. \n3  INPRES 5/2003.  \n ", "  Appendix 19  59 \n \nC.
