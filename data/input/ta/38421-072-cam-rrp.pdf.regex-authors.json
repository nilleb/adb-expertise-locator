I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Kingdom of Cambodia for subprogram 3 of the Promoting Economic Diversification \nProgram.1  \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n2.  Cambodia has grown from a post-conflict country to a small open vibrant economy. The \nRectangular Strategy; National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP), 2006\u20132010;2 and NSDP \nPlan Update, 2009\u20132013 are key government documents focusing on maintaining robust growth. \nThe Rectangular Strategy provides a medium-term development strategy that focuses on better \ngovernance and institution building, including anticorruption measures and public administration \nreforms. The NSDP aims to operationalize the Rectangular Strategy. The government adopted \nseveral sector strategies to implement the strategy and plan, such as the trade sector-wide \napproach (SWAp), which underpins a diagnostic trade integration study. The trade SWAp aims \nto expand the private sector by improving foreign and domestic trade and developing efficient \nbackward links in the economy.3 \n \n3.  The policy priorities of the NSDP update intersect closely with Strategy 2020 and the \ncountry partnership strategy (CPS), 2011\u20132013 for Cambodia of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB).4 The overarching objective of the CPS is poverty reduction in line with government \npriorities. The CPS aims to help reduce poverty and promote inclusive growth with an integrated \napproach to rural development, targeting the areas where most poor reside. With nearly 75% of \nthe population engaged in agriculture, the government sees economic diversification and private \nsector  development  as  two  ways  to  help  achieve  inclusive  growth,  i.e.,  reach  its  poverty \nreduction goal of more than 1% per annum and accomplish the NSDP update policy thrusts. \n \n4.  The NSDP, the NSDP update, and the trade SWAp have helped Cambodia improve its \ncompetitiveness. According to the global competitive index produced by the World Economic \nForum, Cambodia\u2019s competitiveness rank improved from 109 in 2008 to 97 in 2012. However, \nthe economic base of the economy remains narrow; in 2007, three subsectors\u2014garments, \nconstruction, and tourist-related services\u2014accounted for up to 42% of gross domestic product \n(GDP). Garments contributed 16% of GDP in 2007 and 15% in 2008. Its share of total exports \nhas been more than 90% since 2003. During 2010\u20132011, garments accounted for 76% of the \nmanufacturing  sector.  During  the  same  period,  while  its  percentage  share  in  GDP,  the \ncontribution to export revenue decreased to 74% of GDP. The high economic dependence on \ngarment exports makes the economy vulnerable to external shocks. Hence, a more diversified \neconomy supported by vibrant private sector development is needed for Cambodia to sustain \nhigh economic growth, reduce economic volatility, and reduce poverty. This requires more \ndifficult reforms to improve competitiveness throughout the supply chain. Value-chain studies \nidentify constraints to export diversification as poor product quality, an inadequate sanitary and \nphytosanitary standards (SPS) policy framework, limited access to technology and business \ndevelopment  services, underdeveloped  links  between  the  rural  and modern  sectors  of the \neconomy, and relatively costly logistics. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government of Cambodia. 2006.

Manila. \n ", "2   \n \n5.  The Promoting Economic Diversification Program cluster approved by the ADB Board of \nDirectors in December 2008 is designed to support the government priorities and promote \neconomic diversification by (i) enhancing competition in domestic markets and lowering cost of \nregulation, (ii) strengthening investor confidence in the regulatory environment and promoting \nmarket-based innovation, and (iii) strengthening trade facilitation measures along the entire \nsupply  chain.5 The  program  comprises  three  subprograms  from  2008  to  2012.6 Under \nsubprogram 1, financed by ADB in 2008 (SDR13.419 million), the government implemented a \nseries  of  investment  and  trade  facilitation  measures  that  laid  the  foundation  for  a  more \ncompetitive and diversified economy in the longer term. The subprogram included a $2 million \nSPS capacity development project (footnote 4). Subprogram 2, which  is financed by ADB \n(SDR6.565 million as a loan and $9 million as a grant), responded to policy challenges arising \nfrom the impact of the global financial crisis, such as the need for competition policy, regulatory \nefficiency, and innovation to promote private sector competitiveness. Similar to subprogram 1, \nsubprogram  2  included  a  capacity  development  project  for  SPS  and  regulatory  impact \nassessment (RIA).7 \n \n6.  In implementing the program, ADB has closely coordinated with development partners, \nsuch as the European Commission, the International Finance Corporation, the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, the United \nStates  Agency  for  International  Development,  the  World  Bank,  and  the  World  Trade \nOrganization.  This  provides  holistic  support  for  private  sector  development  in  Cambodia \n(Appendix 3). \n \n7.  Subprogram 3 is the last subprogram of the program cluster. It is built on progress made \nunder  subprograms  1  and  2  on  investment  climate,  trade  policy,  and  trade  facilitation. \nSubprogram 3 draws on best international practice for a comprehensive trade and investment \nprogram. Activities include (i) establishment of an office of regulatory impact assessment (ORIA) \nto be responsible for regulatory review and thus decrease the regulatory burden for the private \nsector, (ii) capacity development assistance to address constraints of SPS service providers for \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), (iii) implementation of a pilot SPS technology \nmatching  grants  component  that  aims  to  address  demand-side  issues  of  SMEs,  and  \n(iv) assistance for Cambodia\u2019s global and regional integration efforts via support for World Trade \nOrganization\u2019s trade policy review (TPR) on Cambodia and its participation in the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) regional trade agreements and ASEAN commitments to \ndevelop competition policy and law. \n \n8.  Subprogram 3 incorporates gender considerations in its policy reforms. This is in line \nwith government recognition of the importance of women\u2019s entrepreneurship as a growth engine \nfor  the  economy.  In  2011,  Cambodia\u2019s  economic  survey  showed  that  60%  of  500,000 \nestablishments in the country were owned and operated by women, of these, 180,000 were new \nestablishments.  Women  owned  nearly  40%  of  the  new  establishments.  The  government \nsupports the role of women in catalyzing private sector development. The Ministry of Women\u2019s \nAffairs  has  assisted  the  Ministry  of  Commerce  (MOC)  in  setting  up  MOC\u2019s  gender \nmainstreaming action plan, which promotes women entrepreneurs. \n \n                                                \n5  The Development Policy Letter is in Appendix 3 and the Policy Matrix, listing the triggers and milestones defined for \nthis program and including the postprogram partnership framework, is in Appendix 4. \n6  ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n ", "    3   \n9.  Subprogram 3 is one of the ADB programs in Cambodia aiming to improve private sector \naccess to better quality SPS services and quality. ADB provides national assistance to SPS \n(through the Promoting Economic Diversification Program) and regional assistance through the \nGreater Mekong Strategy Trade Facilitation Program.8 Subprogram 3 focuses on the regulatory \nreform  of  SPS  management  in  Cambodia,  while  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Trade \nFacilitation Project builds on and strengthens SPS management capacity in Cambodia and the \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic to contribute to intraregional trade, export competitiveness, \nand health protection. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The impact of the Promoting Economic Diversification Program is an expanded and \ndiversified private sector. By the end of 2015, the program is expected to have increased \ninvestment and economic diversification through more robust competition in domestic markets, \nlowered  regulatory  compliance  costs  and  better  investor  protection,  increased  exports  and \ndiversification of products through private sector access to better quality SPS services and \ntechnology, and reduced customs trade facilitation costs. \n \n11.  The outcome of the  program will be an improved business environment where the \nprivate  sector  operates  efficiently  and  effectively.  This  will  be  reflected  in  an  improved \ncompetition policy framework and institutionalized government regulatory review systems that \npromote better appreciation of the costs and benefits of regulations and greater transparency, \nstrengthen the SPS management system, increase government capacity to assess trade policy, \nand address the backlog in World Trade Organization (WTO) compliance and legal notifications. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n12.  The report and recommendation of the President for subprogram 2 identified 10 policy \ntriggers for subprogram 3 (Appendix 4). In the process of assessing implementation progress, \nthe government proposed a revision to a policy trigger on submission of trade remedy legislation \nto  the  national  assembly.  All  21  measures  (10  triggers  and  11  milestones)  required  for \nsubprogram 3 were completed by the end of August 2012 (Appendix 4).9 The immediate and \nmedium-term challenges are briefly outlined in the postprogram partnership framework (PPPF) \nin the program\u2019s policy matrix (Appendix 4). The PPPF advocates for continued support for the \ndevelopment of the policy framework and institution building, identifies government priorities for \nreform, and emphasizes needed improvements for the policy coordination framework. \n \n1.  Regulatory Efficiency and Competition Policy \n \n13.  Subprogram 3 supports the government\u2019s agenda to improve the regulatory environment \nfor business. The objective is to promote greater competition in domestic markets and lower \nregulatory compliance costs faced by businesses through measures linked to subprogram 2 \naccomplishments. Such measures are reforms in institutionalizing good practices in regulation \nand RIAs, and public consultation for the draft competition law. The following measures toward \nachieving these objectives are complete. \n \n14.  Institutionalize  regulatory  impact  assessments  in  government. The government \nestablished ORIA under the Economic, Social, and Cultural Council (ECOSOCC) of the Office \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2012.

Manila. \n9  Performance of the Promoting for Economic Diversification, Subprogram 3 Triggers (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "4   \nof the Council of Ministers (OCM). This is the culmination of the conceptualization of ORIA in \nsubprogram 2. The establishment of ORIA institutionalizes good policymaking and reduces the \nregulatory burden in Cambodia. The fully operationalized ORIA produced a manual, guidelines, \nand checklist on RIA. These products introduce policymakers to the importance of calculating \nthe costs and benefits of a regulation, and the need to weigh alternative solutions to problems \nidentified. Thus, the end result improves Cambodia\u2019s business climate. In promoting RIA, ORIA \nestablished RIA pilot projects in four line ministries, i.e., the Ministry of Industry, Mines, and \nEnergy (MIME), MOC, the Ministry of Tourism (MOT), and the Ministry of Environment. \n \n15.  Build awareness and capacity to undertake regulatory impact assessments. MIME \nand MOC have taken ownership of the RIA process. In MIME, the RIA unit is a permanent task \nforce and, starting in 2011, all regulatory proposals in MIME\u2019s General Department of Industry \nare subject to the RIA process. In MOC, the RIA process is applied to the regulatory processing \nof two main important laws: Competition Law and Trade Remedies. Both MIME and MOC have \ncompleted one preliminary impact assessment. The four pilot RIA units have completed their \n2012\u20132013 work plans. The newly created ECOSOCC website (www.ecosocc.gov.kh) includes \nORIA activities and preliminary impact assessments. \n \n16.  Increase female participation in regulatory efficiency. ORIA mainstreams gender in \nits activities and takes into account gender issues in regulatory analysis. As such, the recently \ndeveloped manual for preliminary impact assessments includes a checklist for gender impact \nassessment, and analyses of the impact on women and equity, impact on women\u2019s roles, and \nthe participation of women in decision-making. RIA assessors first consult female entrepreneurs \nwhen assessing new regulations. \n \n17.  Promote competition in the domestic market. The government conducted a public \nconsultation for the draft competition law. MOC, as the lead agency for drafting the law, shared \nthe draft law with other relevant government stakeholders and with the private sector through a \nseries of public consultations. This action supports the government\u2019s commitment to have a \ncompetition policy by 2015\u2014one of the main actions the government will accomplish in the \nRectangular Strategy, phases 1 and 2. For the government, a competition policy is expected to \nimprove  the  efficiency  of  the  economy,  thus  benefitting  consumers.  It  is  also  part  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s commitment to WTO and ASEAN. The ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint \nrequires that all ASEAN countries introduce a competition policy by 2015.10 \n \n2.  Investment Climate \n \n18.  Subprogram  3,  as  the  last  subprogram  of  the  Promoting  Economic  Diversification \nProgram, implements reforms that allow the government to improve the investment climate \nthrough  the  promotion  of  technology  diffusion,  increased  access  to  finance,  and  gender \nmainstreaming. Measures accomplished by the government include (i) the General Department \nof Taxation at the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) is giving priority to negotiating a \ndouble tax agreement (DTA) and has a DTA module, (ii) the General Department of Industry at \nMIME is starting to implement the capacity development plan for technology and innovation \npolicy, and (iii) MEF is introducing a partial credit guarantee facility for a sector-specific industry. \n \n19.  Investor confidence and protection. The government, with ADB technical assistance, \nis finalizing a draft policy framework for the DTA, a draft DTA negotiation program that identifies \nthe first country for negotiation, and a draft DTA module. The government sees the importance \nof DTA because it provides foreign investors with security and stability on the issue of taxation \n                                                \n10 ASEAN. 2003. ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint. Jakarta. \n ", "    5   \nand relief from double taxation. Hence, it will have a positive impact on foreign investment in \nCambodia. \n \n20.  Technology diffusion. The government is implementing the Technology Development \nFund (TDF). The TDF is a pilot matching grants fund between ADB and the government that \nassists SMEs with a proven track record in food processing to upgrade their SPS-related \nproduct quality and management processes, thus enhancing their competitiveness in domestic \nand international markets. The matching grant would be up to 50% of an SME\u2019s upgrading \nproject cost to a maximum of $30,000. During the first round of the TDF, the government \nselected 10 food processing SMEs using a lottery scheme. The fund-matching disbursement \nwas approximately $256,000, ranging from $15,000 to $30,000 per SME. Women own and \nmanage seven of the 10 selected SMEs. This indicates an increase in female entrepreneurship \nand is in line with the findings of the 2011 economic survey. The government is currently in the \nprocess of selecting the next TDF recipients in the second round, which will draw from 25 food-\nprocessing SMEs. \n \n21.  Access to finance. MEF and the National Bank of Cambodia introduced a partial credit \nguarantee scheme to guarantee loans from commercial banks to companies and rice millers. In \n2010, the government adopted a new rice policy based on an ambitious 5-year plan aimed at \nexpanding the production and export of rice. However, lack of financing is constraining the \ngovernment\u2019s goal of expanding its production and export capacity and becoming a major \nexport nation. To be able to export more milled rice, local rice millers need more financing to \npurchase large amounts of Cambodia\u2019s paddy rice for processing domestically. The new credit \nguarantee  scheme  provides  short-term  loans  to  the  rice  millers.  In  the  2011  budget,  the \ngovernment allocated up to $25 million to the partial credit guarantee scheme. In addition, the \nWorld Bank is providing the government with another partial credit guarantee scheme with a \nbroader scope (including working capital and investments for agribusiness in general) and \nlonger loan maturities (medium- to long-term).11 \n \n22.  Gender dimension. Selected private participants in the food processing industry, in \nconjunction  with  the  Sanitary  and  Phytosanitary  Standards  Management  Systems  Project \n(footnote 5), set up an informal private sector consultative group that meets quarterly. The group \npromotes innovativeness and access to technology in the food processing industry. Women \nowners of food processing companies account for almost 40% of the group members. The \ngroup is an effective forum for exchanging information and provides inputs and comments to the \ngovernment on SPS issues, particularly relating to food safety, tax, regulatory burden, the TDF, \nstandards, and legal framework support. \n \n3.  Trade Policy and Facilitation \n \n23.  Subprogram 3 implements the government\u2019s reform agenda on trade policy that started \nin subprogram 2. These reforms aim to lower the cost of doing business for the private sector \nand  provide  implementing  measures  to  improve  trade  facilitation  (customs  and  SPS)  for \nenhanced competitiveness. The following measures are complete. \n \n24.  Trade policy reforms. Trade policy reforms continue with WTO publishing Cambodia\u2019s \nfirst TPR. The government finalized the revised trade remedies legislation and accompanying \nimplementing regulations. Subprogram 3 assisted the government in conducting and finalizing \nthe TPR12 in November 2011. Cambodia is the first least-developed country to produce a TPR. \n                                                \n11 World Bank. 2010. Cambodia\u2013Agribusiness Access to Finance Project. Washington, DC. \n12 The  TPR provides  a  review  of  Cambodia\u2019s  trade and  investment policies  and  highlights  the government\u2019s \ncommitment for continuing trade reform. \n ", "6   \nFor trade remedies, the government shortened the 2010 draft trade remedies legislation from \n100 articles to 46 (footnote 7). The trade remedies working group13 believes that shorter draft \nlegislation, comprising only the substantive part of the law and not the implementing articles, \nwould gain wider support from relevant stakeholders.14 The working group also produced the \nimplementing regulations. The policy trigger initially anticipated the draft law\u2019s submission to the \nNational  Assembly.  However,  the  consultation  process  on  the  proposed  trade  remedies \nlegislation has been prolonged to ensure greater stakeholder support. Consistent with domestic \nlaw-making practice, the government now plans submission to the OCM by September 2012 for \nits endorsement and submission to Parliament in 2013. \n \n25.  Trade  facilitation  in  customs  reforms. The General Department of Customs and \nExcise (GDCE) rolled out the national automated system for customs data (ASYCUDA) in all \nmajor ports in Cambodia. This continues the process of introducing ASYCUDA to three main \nports  in  subprogram  2;  ASYCUDA  now  operates  in  Sihanoukville  Port,  Phnom  Penh \nInternational Airport, Phnom Penh Port, and dry ports and customs border checkpoints (MSE-\nKPM, Poi Pet, So Nguon, Bavet, Tech Srun, Teng Lay, Trapaing Phlong, and Trapaing Sre), \nand covers both import and export processing.  Progress has also been made in customs \nvaluation transaction. As of 1 January 2011, the government terminated the use of price list \nmethods for valuing certain sensitive items and high-risk goods, including used vehicles, other \nused items, and petroleum products. Instead, a complaint procedure and appeals process for \nthese valuations is in place. GDCE implemented the WTO valuation agreement in parallel with \nthe decentralization of customs valuation decision-making, and obtained significant early results. \nFor example, 50% of dutiable goods were processed using the transaction value. \n \n26.  Capacity, enforcement, and awareness in food safety management systems. In \nsubprogram  3,  the  government  strengthened  risk  management  on  cross-border  market \nsurveillance activities for food safety. The Ministerial Regulation (Prakas 155) introduced a risk \nmanagement unit in the Cambodia Import\u2013Export Inspection and Fraud Repression Directorate \nGeneral of MOC. The government also improved interministerial coordination on food safety \nbetween the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (MAFF), the Ministry of Health \n(MOH), MOC, MEF, MIME, and MOT by issuing an interministerial prakas (IMP) in October \n2010 on the implementation of food safety based on the farm-to-table approach (IMP 868). The \nregulation defines the roles and responsibilities for food safety within the supply chain among \nthe  six  government  ministries  and/or  agencies.  On  the  implementation  of  food  safety,  the \ngovernment issued food safety guidelines, which were to be a precursor to the food policy. The \ngovernment also strengthened the delivery of SPS services to the private sector and community \nby improving the quality of services of the Institute of Standards of Cambodia (ISC) and the \nIndustrial Laboratory Center of Cambodia (ILCC). Lastly, the government, with the assistance of \nthe ADB grant (footnote 5), drafted a food policy. \n \n27.  Professionalization of the food safety management system. The government built \nthe capacity of ILCC, ISC, MAFF, MOC, and MOH personnel through a series of programs \nfinanced  under the  program  cluster. The government  views  the  development  of  a  pool of \nqualified  and  internationally  registered  auditors  as  critical  to  professionalize  food  safety \nmanagement. This capacity building is complete. First, with the assistance of the ADB SPS \nproject, 19 government food safety auditors (four are women) were trained as International \n                                                \n13 The trade remedies working group is an interministerial working group led by MOC and comprising the Council of \nJurists, ECOSOCC, GDCE, MAFF, MIME, and the National Assembly. \n14 The current legislative process to prepare a draft law in Cambodia requires the draft law to be reviewed first by the \ninterministerial meeting before it is approved by the Council of Ministers for approval by the Prime Minister\u2019s Office. \nA delicate balancing between maintaining the core of the draft law while accommodating the needs of the other \nstakeholders is crucial to gain support. \n ", "    7   \nOrganization for Standardization (ISO) 22000 lead auditors.15 The result has been impressive: \n11 auditors (3 are women) passed the ISO qualification examinations. Second, 33 staff of ILCC, \nISC, and MIME (12 are women) are enrolled in intermediate and pre-intermediate technical \nEnglish  classes.  The  classes  are  a  critical  requirement  for  ISO  accreditation.  Third,  the \nCambodia Certification Department of ISC, which is responsible for the certification schemes, \nwas also assessed by international accreditation bodies for compliance with ISO 17021 and \nILCC for compliance with ISO 17025. The Cambodia Certification Department addressed the \ntwo main conformities found during the audit and is currently waiting for the response from the \naccreditation body. ILCC has obtained ISO accreditation for test parameters and ISO 17025 \naccreditation  from  the  National  Association  of  Testing  Authorities  in  Australia  for  seven \nmicrobiology tests. ILCC has also been awarded certification for ISO 17025 for a full range of \nfood and water tests. These accreditation processes increase the professionalization of food \nsafety management in Cambodia. Fourth, ILCC, with the assistance of an ADB grant, provided \nstaff with on-the-job-training and targeted training programs for food safety in other countries, \nsuch as Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Viet Nam.16 Eight ILCC staff (three are women) enrolled in \nexternal training courses. Fifth, ILCC continues to commercialize to meet increasing demand for \nits services.  The number of commercial tests completed increased by 34% in 2010 and 22% in \n2011. In addition, in 2010, ILCC\u2019s income increased by 130% and gross profits by about 170%. \nTo meet increasing demand, ILCC produced business plans for 2011 and 2012, and financial \nprojections. \n \nD.  Development Financing and Program Costs \n \n28.  To support reform initiatives, the government has requested a loan in various currencies \nequivalent to SDR16,568,000 ($25 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to \nfinance subprogram 3 of the Promoting Economic Diversification Program cluster. The loan will \nhave a 24-year term including an 8-year grace period, and interest of 1% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft loan agreement. The government will meet the remaining resource requirement. The \nproceeds of the program loan will be disbursed in accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s \nrelevant policy.17 ADB will retain the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the \naccuracy of the withdrawal application certification. \n \n29.  The  program  size  reflects  the  development  financing  needs  in  2012  central \ngovernment\u2019s budget of $1 billion and factors required to support implementation of the policy \nmatrix  (Appendix  4).  ADB  estimates  that  the  long-run  benefits  of  the  reform  program  are \napproximately 2.6% of GDP or over $290 million (in 2010 prices).18 These economic benefits \ninclude increased output and investment from a reduction in business costs of compliance with \nlicensing, lower trade facilitation costs, increased foreign direct investment due to a better \ninvestment climate, increased productivity due to lower incidence of food and water-related \ndiseases and premature mortality in the human population, and higher tax revenue due to a \nbroader tax base. The reforms will also have important distributive effects that will increase \nemployment and wages. Distribution of labor will be more widespread as more labor will be \nemployed in new industry. Female entrepreneurship will also thrive. Policy adjustment costs to \nthe government and private sector are conservatively estimated as a discounted present value \nlump sum of $30 million (or $18 million without the present value lump sum). These adjustment \ncosts include administrative, enforcement, and fiscal costs to the government in implementing \n                                                \n15 ISO 22000 is an international standard that defines the requirements of a food safety management system. \n16  The ILCC team trained at Dynamics Bangkok in Thailand, at the Institute of Technology in Sri Lanka, and at \nIntertech Lab in Viet Nam. \n17 ADB. 1998.

The policy \nadjustment costs include the increased business costs of compliance with the SPS reforms \nrelated to mandatory SPS-sensitive standards (conservatively estimated at $5 million). \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n30.  MOC,  the  executing  agency  for  the  subprogram,  will  be  responsible  for  overall \nimplementation  of  subprogram  3,  including  carrying  out  all  policy  actions,  program \nadministration, and maintenance of program records. The subprogram 3 will be implemented \nfrom October 2011 to September 2012. The implementation arrangements under subprograms \n1 and 2 will continue under subprogram 3. MOC will use a steering committee chaired by the \nminister  of  commerce  and  comprising  senior  officials  from  MEF  and  MIME.  The  steering \ncommittee is responsible for coordinating implementation and sustaining the program cluster \npolicy actions with MOC and relevant line ministries and agencies involved in supporting the \nprogram  (MEF,  MIME,  the  Ministry  of  Environment,  MOH,  MOT,  and  ECOSOCC).19 The \ncommittee will meet quarterly to monitor progress and oversee program implementation. ADB \nmay be invited to participate in the meetings as an observer. English translations of the minutes \nof these meetings will be forwarded to ADB within 2 weeks of each meeting. MOC will be \nresponsible for day-to-day program implementation activities, and report on implementation \nprogress. MEF will be responsible for subprogram 3 disbursements. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Governance \n \n31.  The country\u2019s financial management systems were assessed to identify fiduciary risks \nand determine fiduciary arrangements for subprogram 3. The assessment was based on the \nsector work of ADB\u2019s report on Cambodia\u2019s country governance risk assessment and risk \nmanagement plan.20 The first national governance risk assessment and risk management plan \nfor Cambodia was prepared using ADB\u2019s Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan \nand its implementation guidelines.21 The assessment is risk-based and looks at risk in relation to \nfiduciary matters and broader governance risks to achieving satisfactory development outcomes. \nThe  approach  is  based  on  three  core  governance  areas:  public  financial  management, \nprocurement,  and  corruption.  The  report  assesses  public  financial  management  to  have \ngradually  progressed,  given  the  strong  government  Public  Financial  Management  Reform \nProgram. The results of the 2010 public expenditure financial accountability (PEFA) indicate \nmixed but improving performance since the 2002 PEFA. The 2010 PEFA finds Cambodia to be \nat par with other low-income countries at similar stages of development. Financial accountability \nimproved markedly, i.e., significant progress with budget formulation, internal controls, treasury \noperations and cash management, accounting system, and internal and external auditing. The \nprocurement assessment, which used several recent procurement diagnostic studies of the \nWorld Bank, ADB, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, indicates \nlimited recent tangible progress, but significant reform work is well under way and could result in \n                                                \n19 ECOSOCC is one of the councils in the OCM. Its key function is to review all proposed legislation and subdecrees \nprior to submission to cabinet for consideration. It also provides economic advice to the OCM. \n20 ADB. 2012.

Manila. \n ", "    9   \nimportant progress. The anticorruption assessment indicates important recent legislative and \ninstitutional developments with prospects for improvement have not yet achieved significant \nresults. Important new legislative developments include penalty provisions in the new Law on \nthe Public Finance System (2008), strengthening of the penal code in relation to corruption \noffenses (2009), and passing of the new Anti-Corruption Law (2010). Institutional work now \nfocuses  on  strengthening  the  capacity  of  the  Anti-Corruption  Unit  to  fulfill  its  mandate  as \nprovided for under the new law. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government. \n \nB.  Poverty and Social \n \n32.  Subprogram 3 will contribute to sustainable poverty reduction through three channels. \nThe  first  channel  is  through  higher,  broad-based,  and  sustainable  economic  growth.22 By \nreducing the business compliance costs with the business licensing system, lowering trade \nfacilitation costs, and improving taxation and investor guarantees in line with international norms, \nprivate and foreign investment will increase across a broad range of sectors thereby supporting \nhigher economic growth. The improvement in SPS management systems will aid government \nefforts to develop backward linkages with the agriculture sector. The second channel is through \nthe  labor  market  with  increased  real  wages  and  hiring  activity  across  most  sectors  from \nincreased investment. The lower risk of food and waterborne diseases in the human population \nwill increase productivity and improve household incomes. The third channel is through lower \nprices of goods and services. By improving transparency in trade policy, increasing integration \nwithin the region and the world through trade policy and regulatory reforms, and implementing \ncompetition policy, domestic prices will fall because of greater competition in the economy. \n \n33.  Subprogram 3 is classified under effective gender mainstreaming. The categorization \nreflects a gradual buildup of ADB dialogue with government counterparts on gender issues \nthroughout the Promoting Economic Diversification Program. Subprogram 1 was classified with \nno gender benefits and subprogram 2 was classified with some gender benefits. Subprogram 3 \nbenefits  women  entrepreneurs  by  improving  regulatory  aspects  and  increasing  access  for \ngreater involvement in the economy. From the regulatory aspect, subprogram 3 addresses \nbarriers to integrating gender concerns within the regulation drafting processes by ensuring that \nthe RIA guidelines and checklists are developed to provide actions and indicators for adequate \nconsultation  of  all  key  stakeholder  groups  of  both  genders,  with  monitoring  of  women\u2019s \nparticipation in consultations. Subprogram 3 provides access for women entrepreneurs in the \nfood processing sector by giving them access to funds from the SPS Matching Grants Project \nthat is financed under subprogram 2 to avail of relevant SPS technologies and improve the \nquality of their products. To date, 7 of the 10 entrepreneurs supported by the project are female. \nGender concerns were addressed in the food safety management system. Currently, 30% of \nISO-certified government auditors are women. Female business owners comprise close to 50% \nof  the  private  sector  consultative  group  of  the  food  processing  industry,  which  provides \nfeedback to the government on SPS issues, i.e., food safety and tax. ILCC and ISC continue to \ntrain their female staff in food safety management. To date, three of the eight ILCC staff sent \nabroad for training on food safety are female and one of the four ISC auditors accredited as ISO \n22000 lead auditors is female. \n \nC.  Safeguards \n \n34.  The  program  will  have  (i)  no  adverse  environmental  impacts,  (ii)  no  involuntary \nresettlement impacts, and (iii) no impact on indigenous peoples. It is classified under category C \nfor  involuntary  resettlement,  indigenous  peoples,  and  the  environment.  The  program  is  a \n                                                \n22 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10  \ngeneral intervention aimed at supporting sustainable economic growth. In that respect, it is \nexpected to have an indirect positive effect on poverty reduction. \n \nD.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n35.  The assumptions underlying subprogram 3 include (i) external economic environment \ncontinues to improve to support domestic macroeconomic stability and growth, and (ii) the \ngovernment will continue with key business regulatory reform measures. Subprogram 3 has \nthree potential risks (Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nContinuing  slowdown  in  the  The program supports government efforts to diversify its economic base by promoting \nglobal economy reduces global  access to technology and access to finance to the nontraditional economy, such as the \ndemand  for  Cambodia\u2019s  food processing industry. \ngarments \nThe  capacity  of  agencies  to  The program reduces this risk by focusing on policy triggers that constitute high-priority, \nimplement  reforms  may  be  high-impact policy reforms supported by substantial capacity development assistance in \nconstrained by resources and  the core areas of the program, such as competition policy, regulatory reform, and SPS. \nother emerging priorities \nResistance  to  some  of  the  The program focuses on efforts to support the government\u2019s own initiatives and reforms \nreforms from vested interests,  in areas where political will and commitment are strong.

Similarly, the SPS reforms have \nstrong political commitment supported through the private sector development forum. \nBoth reforms are supported with capacity development projects linked to performance \nmilestones and triggers. \nMIME = Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy; MOC = Ministry of Commerce; MOE = Ministry of Environment; MOT = \nMinistry of Tourism; RIA = regulatory impact assessment; SPS = sanitary and phytosanitary standards. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n36.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the program will conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement.  In  addition  to  the  standard \nassurances, the government will ensure that program steering committee constituted under \nsubprogram 1 will meet semiannually and, if needed, on ad hoc basis to (i) monitor and evaluate \nprogress of the program cluster, in particular the PPPF; and (ii) provide guidance and direction \nto MOC, the implementing agencies, and the relevant line ministries for PPPF implementation. \nThe program steering committee may invite ADB to participate in its meetings. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n37.
