INTRODUCTION   \n1.  The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) to support Henan province in \nformulating its financial reform policy and strategy for rural areas of the Central Plains Economic \nZone  (CPEZ). ADB  fielded  a  mission  to  the  PRC  on  26\u201327  May  2014  and  reached  an \nunderstanding  with  the  government  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation \narrangements, cost estimates, financial arrangements, and the consultants\u2019 terms of reference. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1\n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The PRC is the world\u2019s second largest economy with nominal gross domestic product \n(GDP)  of  $9.28  trillion  in  2013.  The  overall  national  prosperity,  however,  has  not  been \ndistributed fairly across the regions. Industrialization and urbanization have generally been \nfocused in the coastal region, leaving the socioeconomic needs of the western and interior \nregions  mostly  unaddressed.  Widening  regional  and  urban\u2013rural  disparity  remains  a  key \nchallenge for the government. \n \n3.  The CPEZ is the largest economic zone in the PRC in terms of area and population.2 \nLocated in the central region, it has traditionally been the PRC\u2019s key grain production and \nagriculture base. The region produces more than 18% of the nation\u2019s total grain output, and is \nthe biggest producer of wheat with nearly half of the total national output. Considering its \nsignificance in agricultural production, the government is keen to maintain the farmland and \ngrain output in balance with the region\u2019s demand for industrialization and urbanization.  \n \n4.  Areas with greater dependency on primary production or agriculture for income tend to \nexhibit lower per capita incomes. As of 2011, per capita disposable income of urban residents in \nthe CPEZ was $2,852, significantly lower than the national average of $3,492. The net per \ncapita income of rural residents in the CPEZ ($1,061) is relatively comparable with the national \naverage ($1,117 in 2011). However, it falls far below the urban level, and this leads to rural\u2013\nurban migration.3  \n \n5.  The  government  has  recognized  the  importance  of  access  to  finance  in  providing \nopportunities for development. It is particularly true for many rural populations, as the provision \nof  reliable  and  affordable  financial  services  is  limited.  Financial  institutions  in  general  are \nreluctant to respond to the demands of rural finance because of higher transaction costs and \ncredit risk. Despite the government\u2019s substantial policy drive to address this issue, finance \nremains one of the main lagging sectors in rural areas. While total lending through banking \ninstitutions in the PRC has increased by 80% since 2009, and thus increased from 124.8% of \nGDP to 134.7% of GDP, the share of rural lending in total bank lending has increased only \nmarginally.4     \n                                                \n1 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 31 July 2014.  \n2 The CPEZ covers the entire Henan province as well as part of the adjoining provinces of Anhui, Hebei, Shandong, \nand Shanxi, with a total population of 179 million as of 2011 and an area of 289,000 square kilometers. Henan \nprovince represents the majority in terms of population and area. The State Council officially issued the guidance on \nsupporting Henan province to be built into the CPEZ in October 2011, and approved the development plan for \n2012\u20132020.   \n3 Government of the PRC, National Development and Reform Commission. 2012.

Knowledge Work on \nCredit Growth in Microfinance and Rural Finance. Consultant\u2019s report. Manila. \n ", "2   \n \n6.  The State Council called for financial reform tailored to rural areas of the CPEZ in 2011. \nThe importance of establishing a strong rural financial system was reinforced in 2012 through \nthe approval of a development plan for the CPEZ. The plan unveiled the government\u2019s vision to \ntransform the region into a modern agricultural base with increased per capita income and rural \nliving standards. The Henan provincial government is engaged in formulating a development \nstrategy, and one of its key strategic priorities is to improve the access to and quality of financial \nservices for its population in rural areas. An improved rural financial system will promote social \nand economic development and poverty reduction, thus lessening the long-standing issue of \ninequality.   \n \n7.  The majority of rural residents in the CPEZ is engaged in agriculture and agribusinesses \nas a source of livelihood. Rural enterprises and residents are mainly serviced by four types of \nbanking institutions: (i) a policy bank (Agricultural Development Bank of China); (ii) a large \ncommercial bank (Agricultural Bank of China); (iii) the Postal Savings Bank of China; and (iv) \ncooperative  financial  institutions,  including  rural  credit  cooperatives  (RCCs).  RCCs  have \ncollectively played a major role in servicing the financing needs of rural residents by mobilizing \nsavings  and  extending  credit.  Along  with  the  government\u2019s  reform  agendas,  RCCs  have \nundergone numerous reforms and restructuring, and alternative rural financial institutions\u2014such \nas village or township banks, rural mutual  credit cooperatives, and loan companies\u2014have \nemerged in recent years. 5  RCCs are important for rural finance nonetheless, accounting for \nnearly 20% of total outstanding rural lending in 2013, while the provision of credit to rural areas \nremains inadequate.  \n \n8.  It is also notable that the demand for financial products has become more sophisticated \nwith the development of rural economies. In line with the government\u2019s drive to develop rural \nlivelihoods, economic activities in rural areas have diversified and become more dynamic. A \nrising number of rural entrepreneurs and increased household income induce demand for more \ncapital and varied financial services, which adds further pressure on the rural financial system to \nimprove. There is a growing need for financial institutions to offer a full range of financial \nproducts and services and to work closely with rural businesses and households. The regulatory \nframework should be upgraded to encourage financial institutions to provide adequate financial \nservices to rural areas while ensuring financial stability.  \n \n9.  Given the diverse characteristics of rural areas in the PRC, there is no single best rural \nfinancial system that would adequately satisfy the needs across the whole country. Hence, the \nHenan provincial government needs a good grasp of the prevailing conditions of its financial \nsystem in comparison with the actual needs of rural enterprises and residents in order to identify \nareas  for  development.  Domestic  and  international  best  practices  and  innovation  in  rural \nfinancial products will also be studied for potential policy and strategy options. Based on the \nfindings, a reform policy will be formulated and presented to the Henan provincial government \nfor approval and implementation. \n \n10.  ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for the PRC promotes inclusive growth \nas one of three strategic pillars.6 An improved rural financial system will support promoting rural \n                                                \n5 The RCC is highly recognized for making credit available in rural areas since its establishment in the 1950s, and at \nthe same time is criticized for having problems such as unclear ownership, poor asset quality and losses from \noperations, weak risk-taking capacity, heavy government intervention, and lack of competition in the local financial \nmarket. The government has implemented a series of reforms aiming at channeling credit to the needed agricultural \nand rural development and improving sustainability. \n6 ADB. 2012.

ADB has previously supported building an inclusive, \nmarket-oriented, rural finance system and strengthening financial supervision in rural finance. \nThe proposed TA is the continuation of ADB\u2019s support for rural finance development in the PRC7 \nand  for  balanced  growth  in  agricultural  areas  of  Henan  province.8 Based  on  previous  TA \nfindings and outputs that delivered national analysis on rural finance, the proposed TA will \nprovide further assistance to the Henan provincial government in promoting the development of \nan effective and sustainable rural financial system tailored to agricultural areas of the CPEZ. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact will be more effective and sustainable rural financial services provided in the \nCPEZ. This will be measured by adoption of recommendations that emerge from the TA. The \noutcome will be improved policy with an actionable road map for the establishment of a rural \nfinancial system in the CPEZ.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  Output 1: Comprehensive report on rural financial system completed. This output \nwill include (i) analysis of the prevailing conditions and key issues of the rural financial system in \nthe CPEZ; (ii) assessment of national and international rural financial reform policies, principles, \nand practices for potential policy and strategy options; (iii) identification of suitable financial \nproducts for  rural  enterprises, farmers,  and  households;  and (iv)  observation  of regulatory \npractices to give recommendations on promoting reliable and sustainable financial services in \nrural areas. Under this output, consultants will be engaged to compile diagnostic studies, review \nrelevant policy and legal documents, examine the state of the financial system in rural areas, \nand incorporate applicable findings and lessons from previous ADB operations in order to \ndevelop an effective reform strategy. Consultants will be required to (i) conduct field surveys \nand interviews with financial consumers and institutions in selected areas of the CPEZ to collect \ninformation and to understand shortcomings of the existing financial system and policy; and (ii) \nundertake in-depth consultations with policy makers, ministries and regulatory bodies, leading \nspecialists, and rural financial institutions in other provinces of the PRC such as Zhejiang and \nJiangsu, where the rural financial system is considered well-established. A report in English and \nChinese will be generated in interim and final versions for wide dissemination of TA findings. \nInception and midterm workshops will be held to discuss the framework and methodology of the \nstudy, and provide timely inputs on the progress. \n \n13.  Output 2: Policy recommendation and road map on financial reform in rural areas \nof the Central Plains Economic Zone formulated and presented. Under this output, the \nconsultants will assist the Henan provincial government in formulating a rural finance reform \nstrategy to facilitate the development of the CPEZ into a modern agricultural base, and a road \nmap to implement the reforms.

The \npurpose of the study tour is to observe international best practices on rural financial systems \nand innovation in financial products, as well as identify policies and regulatory frameworks \nrelevant to the Henan context. Meetings and workshops with policy makers and other key \nstakeholders will be organized for in-depth discussion and guidance on further improvement of \nthe study. A final workshop will be organized to invite experts, government officials, and industry \nleaders  to  present  ideas  and  provide  feedback  on  recommendations  in  order  to  promote \nconsensus and concerted actions later on, and to disseminate the TA findings. A policy brief \nenumerating key recommendations and road map will be generated and disseminated to high-\nlevel policy makers for support. The final outputs will be presented to the Henan provincial \ngovernment for approval and implementation. Upon approval, it is expected that pilot cities will \nbe selected in rural areas of Henan province to implement financial reforms.  \n \n14.  Potential risks are (i) inadequate capacity of the market and participants for full-scale \nimplementation of rural financial reform, (ii) insufficient support from the government and market, \nand (iii) inadequate coordination and communication between various stakeholders. To mitigate \nrisks, the government has agreed to provide adequate counterpart support and all necessary \ndata in a timely manner. Regular consultation with policy makers and industry participants will \nalso be arranged during implementation for shared understanding and desired support.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, access to data sources, office \naccommodation, office equipment and supplies, secretarial assistance, logistical support, and \nother in-kind contributions. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 21 months, from 1 October 2014 to 30 June 2016. The \nFinance Bureau of the Henan provincial government will be the executing agency and the \nFinancial Services Office (FSO) of the Henan provincial government will be the implementing \nagency.  The  executing  and  implementing  agencies  will  consult  with  officials  from  relevant \ngovernment  offices,  including  provinces  that  are  part  of  the  CPEZ  as  well  as  regulatory \nagencies, during project implementation. \n \n17.  Under  close  supervision  of  the  implementing  agency  and  ADB,  the  TA  will  be \nundertaken by consultants with substantial expertise in rural finance. The team leader will \ndevelop a detailed work plan with the FSO at the outset of the TA, and will take the lead \nresponsibility  in  coordinating  with  other  consultants.  ADB  will  facilitate  implementation  and \nsupervision of the TA through regular communication and review missions with the executing \nand implementing agencies, and the consultants. ADB will also facilitate the access to pertinent \navailable  information  and  data  from  previous  operations.  The  implementing  agency  will \nsupervise  the  day-to-day  work  of  the  consultants  and  take  responsibility  for  administering \nconsultation with stakeholders, seminars, workshops, and international study tour.  \n \n18.  One international consultant for 4 person-months and five national consultants for 18 \nperson-months in total will be recruited individually in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The consultants will be selected \nbased on their academic qualifications and relevant work experience. Individual recruitment will \n ", "  5 \nbe used in view of each consultant\u2019s experience and qualification being the main requirements, \nand streamlined recruitment requirements to expedite the process. Outline terms of reference \nfor all consultants are in Appendix 3. Consulting services contracts will include expenses related \nto consultants and surveys as indicated in the cost estimates and financing plan (Appendix 2). \nThe proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). An advance payment facility \nmay be provided to the executing agency to administer the activities of workshops and study \ntour.  \n \n19.  With support from the consultants, the FSO will submit quarterly progress reports to \nADB. The TA will be periodically monitored and evaluated based on the implementation of \nactivities and satisfactory delivery of intended outcome and outputs, as defined in the design \nand  monitoring  framework.  The  FSO  will  monitor  project  progress  against  the  project \nimplementation schedule, and will inform ADB of any significant deviations. A report and policy \nbriefs will be prepared and disseminated during the final stakeholders\u2019 workshop. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Study of Financial Reform in Rural \nAreas of the Central Plains Economic Zone, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nMore effective and  Amount of rural lending and  Statistical documents  Sound rural financial \nsustainable rural  savings mobilized in the    reform policy \nfinancial services  CPEZ to be increased by  Documentation of  implemented \nprovided in the CPEZ  10% in 2020 (baseline to be  executing and \nRisk \nestablished)  implementing \nCapacity of the market \nagencies \nand participants are \n \ninadequate for full-scale \nimplementation of rural \nfinancial reform \nOutcome      Assumption \nImproved policy with  Reform proposal on rural  Documentation of  Central and provincial \nactionable road map  financial system in the CPEZ  executing and  governments are \nfor the establishment  presented to the provincial  implementing  committed to improve \nof rural financial  government for approval by  agencies  rural financial system \nsystem in the CPEZ   June 2016   \nRisk \n \nReform is delayed with \nlack of support from the \ngovernment and market \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
