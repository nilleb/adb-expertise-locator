INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  produce  studies  on  the \npromotion of e-commerce for targeted poverty reduction in rural and mountainous areas of \nChongqing Municipality, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The TA will also support the \npreparation of policy recommendations, and organize capacity building for applying e-commerce \nin rural and mountainous areas.  \n \n2.  The TA is in the 2017\u20132019 country operations business plan for the PRC.1 Following a \nfact-finding mission on 31 August\u20131 September 2017, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and \nChongqing Municipal Government reached an understanding on the impact, outcome, outputs, \ncost estimates, financing plan, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Some 56 million people live in poverty in rural areas of the PRC, according to 2015 figures, \nbased on the national poverty line of CNY2,980 per year.3 They mainly live in remote and \nmountainous areas, particularly in the west and southwest of the country including Chongqing \nMunicipality. By the end of 2016, Chongqing had a poverty population of about 710,000, mainly \nliving in its rural and mountainous areas, many of whom are women.4 The Government of the \nPRC  has  set  a  target  to  eliminate  absolute  poverty  by  2020,  and  encourages  innovative \napproaches to poverty reduction, including e-commerce. The State Council issued directives for \ndeveloping e-commerce in rural areas as a tool for targeted poverty reduction.5 This is expected \nto expand markets for agriculture products and services, provide more timely and accurate market \ninformation to guide agricultural production, create more nonfarm jobs, and raise rural income.  \n \n4.  The World Trade Organization defines e-commerce as \u201cthe sale or purchase of goods or \nservices conducted over computer networks by methods specifically designed for the purpose of \nreceiving or placing of orders.\u201d6 E-commerce has several key advantages over traditional ways of \ndoing business. First, e-commerce lowers the cost of doing business, as the seller requires \nminimal physical infrastructure. It improves market access for traders, as it connects the supply \nand demand sides without traditional physical limitations and without certain transaction costs\u2014\nincreasing profit margins for traders. Second, e-commerce permits better and faster customer \nservice, and saves time and money. This helps improve competitiveness, particularly for small \nand medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that have difficulty competing and surviving in the market. \nThese advantages make e-commerce a powerful and low-cost tool for expanding trade networks \nin rural areas. E-commerce could play an important role in reducing poverty in rural areas, and \nwill also help empower women by creating higher-income jobs selling agricultural products.  \n \n5.  E-commerce has been growing rapidly in the PRC since 2011. By the end of 2016, the \nPRC had 731 million internet users, of which 467 million were engaged in online shopping and \n209 million in selling goods and services.7 The total value of e-commerce transactions reached \n                                                \n1   ADB. 2017.

E-commerce has also been growing fast in \nrural areas, but it still lags urban areas. Internet users in rural areas account for only 27.4% of the \nnational total, and the value of online retail sales in rural areas was CNY895 billion, accounting \nfor 17.4% of the national total.  \n \n6.  Overall, e-commerce in Chongqing has undergone rapid growth since 2011, and total \nonline sales in 2016 reached CNY50 billion, an increase of 25.6% over 2015. However, online \nsales in rural areas accounted for only 11.0% of the total. Chongqing has yet to overcome \nchallenges to realize the potential of e-commerce in supporting economic development in rural \nand mountainous areas, where most of its poor people live.  \n \n7.  In addition to gaps in physical infrastructure for e-commerce in rural areas, three key soft \nconstraints need to be addressed.8  \n(i)  The local e-commerce platforms have had limited success in building e-commerce \nbusiness models to cater to local conditions and meet the needs of trade in \nagriculture-related products, which are usually seasonal, perishable and time-\nsensitive, small in quantity but large in variety, and widely dispersed in terms of \nproduction locations. The business models used for agricultural e-commerce in \nChongqing  are  mostly  replicated  (with  little  innovation)  from  established                     \ne-commerce  platforms,  which  are  more  suitable  for  the  large-scale  sale  of \nindustrial and manufactured goods, particularly brand products.  \n(ii)  The policy and legal framework for e-commerce in rural areas is still inadequate. \nProgress in local legislation for e-commerce is lagging; coordination for policy \nmaking  and  implementation  among  various  agencies  (including  agriculture, \ncommerce, quality inspection, food and drug administration, standardization, and \nbusiness registration departments and/or offices) is often weak; awareness of                \ne-commerce-related policies and laws is usually low among the rural population, \nparticularly  in  remote  mountainous  areas;  and  statistics  and  data  on  rural                   \ne-commerce are lacking.  \n(iii)  Chongqing\u2019s  rural  areas  still  lack  technical  sophistication  and  operational \nexperience  in  e-commerce  because  of  (a)  a  shortage  of  interdisciplinary \nprofessionals who understand not only agriculture, but also marketing and the \ninternet; (b) a low level of participation by poor households and SMEs caused by \npoor literacy in information and communication technology; and (c) lack of a \ncomprehensive capacity building strategy for rural areas based on needs analysis.  \n \n8.  Chongqing is fully aware of these challenges and is increasing its efforts in improving the \nsupporting infrastructure for e-commerce, both physical and soft, to promote e-commerce for \npoverty alleviation in rural areas. The municipal government passed a decision and issued \nguidelines in 2016 to implement the State Council directives (footnote 5), aiming to establish a \ncompetitive and effective e-commerce system in Chongqing\u2019s rural areas by 2020, which will \nsubstantially improve e-commerce coverage in rural and mountainous areas and increase the \ntrade of agricultural products through e-commerce platforms.9  \n \n \n                                                \n8   Infrastructure gaps in rural areas (particularly those below the township level) include lower coverage of the \ntelecommunications network, slower internet speed, and poor logistics facilities and services related to the collection, \nstorage, distribution, and delivery of agricultural produce and other products.  \n9  Government of the PRC, Chongqing Municipality. 2016.

The TA is aligned with the following impact: access to markets for agricultural products \nexpanded (footnotes 5 and 9). The TA will have the following outcome: e-commerce for poverty \nreduction in the rural and mountainous areas of Chongqing strengthened and applied effectively.10  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n10.  The proposed TA will support the efforts of Chongqing in implementing the State Council \ndirectives for e-commerce development for targeted poverty reduction. The TA will have the \nfollowing three outputs: \n(i)  Practical and effective e-commerce business models for poverty reduction \ndeveloped.  The  TA  will  support  a  study  on  the  experience  of  e-commerce \ndevelopment in the southwestern mountainous areas including Wuling, Qinba, and \nWumeng mountain areas. The study will review the status of policies, infrastructure, \nand operational performance related to e-commerce; and identify problems and \nconstraints. It will also review the experience of other areas of the PRC and \nselected foreign countries in applying e-commerce for poverty reduction. Based on \nthe findings of the studies, business models for applying e-commerce for poverty \nreduction (with special attention to the needs of local SMEs, poor households, and \nwomen) will be developed to serve as a reference guide for the poverty areas in \nChongqing and elsewhere in the PRC. Each business model will be supported by \nactual cases with in-depth analysis. The data and information gathered from the \nstudies will also be used to improve policy making and implementation.  \n(ii)  Recommendations on improving legal and policy framework for applying        \ne-commerce in targeted poverty reduction prepared. Based on the findings of \nthe studies and workshops, the TA will produce policy notes to be submitted to \nChongqing  municipal  government  and  relevant  agencies  of  the  PRC  central \ngovernment to inform their policy making, which is expected to have a broader \nimpact  on  poverty  reduction  in  the  country.  The  policy  notes  will  include \nrecommendations to fill the infrastructure gaps and improve the agriculture value \nchain in support of e-commerce development in poor areas.  \n(iii)  Capacity  of  Chongqing  municipal  government  and  poverty  counties  for              \ne-commerce development in rural areas enhanced. The TA will (a) formulate \nan overall institutional strengthening and capacity building plan for developing           \ne-commerce in rural and mountainous areas, with gaps and needs analysis; \n(b) prepare training manuals, which should be easy to understand and use for \npeople living in poverty areas; and (c) organize at least six training workshops for \ne-commerce users from the mountainous areas, with at least three networking \nevents held directly following the training workshops to facilitate interaction and \nbusiness matching between the e-commerce platform enterprises and agricultural \ncooperatives from the rural and mountainous areas.  \n  \n                                                \n10 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $450,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources).
