INTRODUCTION \n1.  In March 2004, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) accepted the administration of the \nJapan  Fund  for  Public  Policy  Training  (JFPPT)  as  a  new  trust  fund.  In  accordance  with \narrangements approved by the Board of Directors, the Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI) \nwas appointed by the Government of Japan as JFPPT administrator. Following implementation of \nthe JFPPT pilot project by ADBI in an initial phase, the Government of Japan held consultations \nwith ADB and ADBI to make arrangements for full-scale implementation of the JFPPT program and \nits  long-term  sustainability.  Subsequently,  it  was  decided  that  the  program  could  be  more \neffectively  and  sustainably  implemented  by  ADB.  The  ADB  Board  of  Directors  approved  the \nmodified implementation arrangements for the JFPPT on 14 October 2005.  \n \n2.  The Fact-Finding mission was fielded in Viet Nam during 17\u201321 October 2005 to brief the \nGovernment of Viet Nam on the modified implementation arrangements, and discuss and agree \nwith the Government on the objective, scope, outputs, and implementation arrangements of a \nregional technical assistance (RETA) to facilitate the transition and formulate a multiyear public \npolicy training project for implementation in Viet Nam under the JFPPT program, prepare and \nconduct pilot short courses in Viet Nam, and commence preliminary work in Cambodia, and the \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) with the same goal and purpose (Appendix 1 gives \nthe design and monitoring framework).1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Over the past few decades, developing member countries (DMCs), especially those with \ntransitional economies, have been undertaking reforms aimed at promoting more market-oriented \npolicies  and  preparing  themselves  for  increased  interaction  and  regional  and  international \neconomic integration. One leading example of this has been Viet Nam\u2019s transition from a centrally \nplanned  economic  system  to  a  socialist-oriented  market  economy  with  associated  public \nadministration  reform,  increasing  economic  integration,  and  resulting  external  competitive \npressure. These reforms change the role of the state and the public sector and require officials in \nthe central and local governments to acquire a broad range of skills in public economics to address \nnew challenges and opportunities.  \n \n4.  As set out in document R33-04,2 the main objective of the JFPPT is to assist DMCs and \ntheir  institutions  to  build  their  capacities  for  public  policy  training  and  education,  with  initial \nconcentration on transition economies such as Viet Nam. The immediate purpose is to (i) conduct \npublic policy training for mid-career and senior government officials and leaders at both national \nand subnational levels, who are involved in formulating and implementing public policies; and (ii) \nsupport initiatives to eventually establish a center of excellence for public policy education. \n \n5.  According  to  the  specific  situation  in  the  DMCs  receiving  support  from  the  JFPPT, \nassistance may be provided to enhance existing public policy training centers or to establish new \ninstitutions to provide education in public policy making, in addition to financing the conduct of \ncarefully  designed  and  high-quality  learning  programs  in  public  policy  and  management.  To \nmaximize  its  synergy  and  impact,  JFPPT-financed  programs  will  be  aligned  with  and  made \n                                                 \n1  The concept clearance was approved on 26 October 2005. Its scope was expanded during the Fact-Finding mission.  \nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 2 November 2005. \n2  ADB. 2004. Cooperation with Japan\u2500Japan Fund for Public Policy Training. Manila. The paper was based on an \nextensive background research by the Asian Development Bank Institute on the need and rationale for such a program \nfor developing member countries, including Viet Nam. \n \n ", "2   \ncomplementary to ADB\u2019s country strategies and programs, poverty partnership agreements, and \npublic administration reform programs. While the major part of the funding will come from the \nJFPPT,  cost-sharing  with  recipient  governments  and  institutions,  where  appropriate,  is  also \nenvisaged. It is understood that this arrangement will enhance  the ownership and commitment of \nrecipient countries and institutions and contribute to the sustainability of public policy training \nactivities in the long run.  \n \n6.  Recognizing  the  urgent  need  and  acknowledging  the  related  requests  to  assist  DMC \ngovernments in strengthening the capabilities of government officials (civil servants) in public \npolicy, the JFPPT was established at ADB in 2004. ADBI undertook the preliminary work for \nimplementing of the program in Viet Nam, including consultations with government agencies; \nidentification  of  potential  partner  universities,  national  and  international  experts;  collection  of \nsecondary information and research reports; and preparation and conduct of two demonstration \nshort courses. A training program office, with modern training facilities, was established in Hanoi, to \nimplement JFPPT projects in Viet Nam, and to gradually begin preparatory work in other DMCs \nsuch as Cambodia and the Lao PDR in later years.  \n \n7.  The Government of Viet Nam (Government) believes that the discipline of public policy was \ncrucial in terms of both public education and in-service training to enhance the quality of leadership \namong civil servants at all levels. Government officials, especially at middle-to-senior levels, are \nstill captive to development management concepts and thinking that were more in line with the \ncentralized economic planning model of the past than with Viet Nam\u2019s free market-based growth \naspirations. The Government believes that the transformation to the new model of economic \ndevelopment  and  social  welfare  will  be  accelerated  by  creating  a  new  generation  of  public \nmanagers steeped in cutting-edge knowledge and skills related to public policy, public sector \nmanagement,  and  public  service  delivery  to  people  and  businesses.  The  Government  also \nwelcomes the idea of developing the JFPPT Viet Nam program as a regional hub for public policy \ntraining and providing learning opportunities for other DMC officials through it. The Government \nhas reconfirmed Viet Nam\u2019s participation in the JFPPT program.3  \n \n8.  Several useful lessons can be drawn from the recent experience of ADB and ADBI in \ncapacity building and training projects in the DMCs. First, at the outset, design of the project and \nchoice of partner institutions are fundamental to make the subsequent phases successful. Second, \ncost-sharing  arrangements  where  appropriate  and  a  participatory  approach  can  be  useful  to \npromote country ownership and effective partnership with national institutions for ensuring the \nintended project results and their sustainability. Third, \u201cpublic policy\u201d in the economic development \nfield cuts across many sectors, themes, and stakeholders; sometimes it can be misconstrued as a \nsensitive area. These lessons will be duly taken into account in formulating and conducting the \nensuing technical assistance (RETA) projects for public policy training under the JFPPT program. \nThe RETA supports ADB\u2019s thematic focus on sustainable economic growth and governance and is \nin line with the country strategy for Viet Nam, Cambodia, and Lao PDR.  \n \n                                                 \n3  Government\u2019s Decision No. 1059/CP-HTQT dated 28 July 2004; and Letter of the Office of the Government Reference \nNo. 4710/VPCP-HTQT dated 19 August 2005, Hanoi, Viet Nam. Concurrence from Cambodia and Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic will be obtained during RETA implementation as their programs will start later, i.e., from 2007. \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The RETA is designed to formulate and implement Public Policy Training Program 2006 \nunder the JFPPT. The overall impact (goal) of the RETA will be an effective start-up to contribute to \nthe process of enhancing the public economic policy capability of government officials in Viet Nam \nand, gradually in later years, in other DMCs such as Cambodia and Lao PDR through the JFPPT \nprogram. The immediate main outcome (purpose) will be to support JFPPT\u2019s transition from its \ninitial implementation to full implementation in Viet Nam; and at a later stage (i.e., from 2007) to \nbegin preliminary work in Cambodia and Lao PDR (Appendix 1).  \n \n10.  The RETA\u2019s main inputs are as follows: (i) operation of the JFPPT program office in Hanoi \nfor the Viet Nam program and as a regional hub4 for public policy training activities under the \nJFPPT program; (ii) formulation of a multiyear public policy training program for Viet Nam; (iii) \ncommencement of preliminary work in Cambodia and Lao PDR for similar programs in the future; \n(iv) preparation and offering of pilot short courses in public economic policy analysis for mid-career \ngovernment officials in Viet Nam; (v) a feasibility study of establishing a public policy training \nschool in Viet Nam (e.g., at the Vietnam National University (VNU); (vi) training materials for short \ncourses; and (vii) creation of a dedicated website for disseminating the data on the JFPPT program \nand its outputs, including training materials, key results, lessons, and a platform for distance \nlearning and e-discussions. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The RETA will adopt a process approach whereby the project components will be designed  \nand implemented in close consultation with the relevant government agencies and local partner \nuniversities such as VNU in the case of Viet Nam. The RETA will review available literature on key \ndevelopment  challenges,  and  skills  and  capabilities  required  to  address  the  new  challenges. \nSpecifically, it will review recently prepared reports on training needs assessment, particularly that \nprepared for conceptualizing the trust fund (i.e., the JFPPT). With the outcome of the literature \nreview and discussions with central Government ministries and agencies, the RETA team will \nidentify priority subject areas for public policy training in the immediate, medium, and long term. \n \n12.  On  the  institutional  capacity-building  side,  a  detailed  review  of  VNU  in  relation  to  its \ncorporate vision, plans, and resources will be carried out. The review will assist in identifying the \npotential for establishing a school of public policy, and required resources and actions. The review \nwill  also  look  at  the  cost  (logistics)  sharing  possibilities,  training  of  trainers,  and  strategic \nmanagement aspects of VNU. As to public education in public policy, a detailed survey of national \nand  regional  universities  in  Viet  Nam  will  be  undertaken,  to  help  assess  their  interests  and \ncapabilities to introduce public policy-related courses at diploma and degree levels.    \n  \n13.  The RETA will take similar approach in the case of other DMCs such as Cambodia and Lao \nPDR for implementation of JFPPT in later years. Following the above method and activities, it will \nprepare a multi-year public policy training program for Viet Nam and start preliminary work in \nCambodia and Lao PDR. The RETA will also prepare and conduct pilot short courses in Viet Nam \nbuilding upon the works already carried out by the ADBI in this regard.  \n                                                 \n4  The RETA will synergize and complement the activities of ADB-supported regional initiatives such as Phnom Penh \nPlan for Development Management, Making Markets Work for the Poor, and Network of Public Administration \nInstitutes of the Asia and Pacific Region. \n ", "4   \n  \n14.  The ensuing JFPPT project in Viet Nam will assist the Government at mainly two levels. On \na broad, long-term level, it will address society\u2019s education needs in the area of public policy. \nCurrently, the discipline is not offered at any of the country\u2019s educational institutions. There is a \ndemand for the subject, especially from among those keen to make a career in government, or \nthose  wishing  to  serve  in  an  international  organization,  or  institution  of  learning.  On  a  more \nimmediate level, the project will provide short-term training to civil servants in the public policy field. \nA range of courses needs to be developed and offered based on the training needs assessment \nthat was recently undertaken by the JFPPT program and also for the Phnom Penh Plan for \nDevelopment Management. Civil servants at both central and provincial levels will be targeted. \nPrograms for awareness, and dissemination of international and regional good practices in public \npolicy will be conducted to benefit high-level government officials and leaders. In addition, an \nanalytical capacity in public policy through training based on real-life case studies/projects will be \ndeveloped at ministry and provincial levels to support immediate policy analysis and development \nrequirements. \n \n15.  The RETA will assist in developing partnerships with regional and international centers of \nexcellences that can best contribute to the development of the public policy discipline in Viet Nam \nand other DMCs. Research anchored in Viet Nam but with perspectives on national, regional, and \nglobal issues will help develop the required learning materials. Establishing a School of Public \nPolicy in the country at a university like VNU that can offer degree programs in public policy, or \nshorter executive programs, will serve the overall objective of the JFPPT program. This approach \nwill lead to at least five outcomes: (i) it will produce civil servants who are better qualified as \nmanagers and leaders of the development process, (ii) it will create a pool of indigenous lecturers \nand professors in the discipline, (iii) learning resources of an international standard will be available \nin  Viet  Nam,  (iv)  high-quality  educational  technology  (learning,  testing,  evaluating)  will  be \ndeveloped indigenously, and (v) the School of Public Policy can develop into a center of excellence \nin the region. However, it is important that partner universities/training institutions have definite a \nlong-term vision, a corporate strategy and plan on how to achieve it, and dedicated and capable \nfaculties (staff) for implementing them. \n \n16.  The training modules/materials, key results, and lessons of the RETA will be disseminated \nthrough seminar discussions, and printed and electronic media. The RETA is envisaged to serve \nas a model for possible replication in other DMCs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing    \n17.  The estimated cost of the RETA is $950,000 for 2006, which will be financed by the JFPPT. \nVoluntary  in-kind  contributions  from  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam  and  other  participating \ngovernments5 and universities and training institutions, will be worth about $200,000. The cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the RETA, the Viet Nam Resident Mission (VRM) will \nbe responsible for overall RETA administration. Implementation will be guided by an Advisory \nCommittee (AC). A highly qualified and experienced program manager will be engaged, and will be \nbased in Hanoi to undertake day-to-day program management, provide leadership and oversight to \nother consultants, and assist VRM in implementing the RETA. The program manager will report to \n                                                 \n5   Cambodia and Lao PDR. \n ", "  5\nthe ADB Country Director, (VRM). The AC will guide and oversee JFPPT program implementation. \nIts members will comprise: senior-level representatives from central ministries, central banks, and \npartner universities such as VNU in the case of Viet Nam, and the ADB country director for Viet \nNam, a senior-level representative from ADB Mekong Department, and a representative of the \nGovernment of Japan. As necessary and appropriate, AC membership will be expanded to include \nother relevant ministries and agencies, and also representatives from Cambodia and Lao PDR and \nADB country directors in later years. The AC will draw on technical advice and inputs from the \nnational and international experts, as necessary. One of the central ministries/agencies nominated \nby the Government will chair the AC and also coordinate with other government agencies for the \nViet Nam program. Appendix 3 gives the terms of reference for the AC chair and the consultants.  \n \n19.  The RETA project (for the 2006 program) will require consulting services from the following \nexperts: a program manager and team leader (international, 12) program officers and economists \n(three  domestic,  12  each),  international  short-term  consultants  (20),  domestic  short-term \nconsultants (30), and equivalent of domestic resource persons and interpreters (20) from partner \nuniversities/training  institutions/local  think-tanks  and  research  community  for  course  design, \ndevelopment,  and  delivery.  The  consultants    will  work  closely  with  the  relevant  government \nministries/agencies and VNU to benefit from local knowledge, to determine government training \nneeds and priorities, and also to provide learning opportunities to those ministries/agencies and \nVNU by involving them in designing and implementing public policy training activities. VNU will be \ngiven more responsibility in preparing courses and delivering them to targeted government officials \nin relation to their work experience and improvement in institutional capability.  \n \n20.  ADB will engage consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. Given the nature \nand  urgency  of  RETA  mobilization,  the  consultants  will  be  engaged  on  an  individual  basis. \nEquipment and related items for website development and operations will be procured following \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n  \n21.  The RETA will be implemented over 12 months. It will start in December 2005 and end in \nDecember 2006. Evaluation of implementation progress and initial outcomes of the RETA will be \ncarried out through periodic reviews of the TA activities and the AC meetings. Representatives \nfrom the Government of Japan will be invited to participate in review missions and also in AC \nmeetings. Implementation progress, including initial outcomes of the project components, will be \ndelivered to all stakeholders through the biannual reports. The JRETA program manager will \nprepare and submit to ADB (i) an inception report, outlining the work plan, within 2 weeks of the \nstart of the RETA; (ii) a monthly progress report; (iii) a midterm report 6 months after the RETA \nstarts;  and  (iii)  a  final  report  9  months  after  the  RETA  starts,  outlining  the  work  plans  for \nsubsequent years.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $950,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Japan Fund for Public Policy Training for Public Policy Training Program 2006, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact (overall goal)       \n     \nEnhanced public economic     \npolicy capability of  Successful management and  Final report \ngovernment officials in Viet  operations of the JFPPT  Beneficiary feedback survey \nNam, and in later years in  program and its activities  AC minutes \nCambodia, and Lao PDR \nOutcome (purpose)      Assumptions \n      \u2022  Full cooperation and active \nPublic Policy Training  A multiyear program  Progress reports  participation of government \nProgram transition from   developed in close  Consultants\u2019 reports  ministries, agencies, and local \ninitial phase implementation  consultation with and    universities (Viet Nam National \nto full implementation  participation of the AC    University) \n  members     \u2022  Timely recruitment and \n      mobilization of RETA staff and \n  consultants  \nRisk \n\u2022  implementation delays due to late \napproval of the RETA and/or \ndelays in mobilizing consultants, \nand government concurrence on \nthe multiyear work program  \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n      \u2022  Timely mobilization of the project \n(i) Takeover and operation of  Takeover of the ADBI/JFPPT    \u2022  No delays in handover/takeover \nthe PPTP office in Hanoi for  Program Office in mid-Dec  Handover/takeover note  \u2022  Wee functioning Advisory \nthe Viet Nam program as well  2005    Committee \nas a regional hub for public      \u2022  Active and quality participation \npolicy training activities under      and guidance by government \nthe JFPPT program       agencies in course prioritization \n      and selection of course \n(ii) Formulation of a multiyear  Program Manager and other    participants \ntraining and public education  consultants recruited and     \nprogram in public economic  mobilized  AC minutes, monthly progress \npolicy analysis in Viet Nam  Task team formed and work  report \n  plan formulated   \n(iii) Commencement of     \npreliminary preparatory work     \nin Cambodia and Lao PDR    AC minutes, monthly progress \nfor similar programs in the  A reconnaissance mission to  report \nfuture (from 2007)   Cambodia and Lao PDR   \n  undertaken    \n(iv) Conduct of pilot executive     \nshort courses in Viet Nam      \n  Identification of priority  AC minutes \n  courses, review of previous  Monthly progress report \n  work, and preparation of  Participants\u2019 feedback \n  course content and conduct  AC minutes \n(v) Conduct of a feasibility  of the short courses   \nstudy for establishing a public     \npolicy training   A task team formed and   \nschool in Viet Nam (e.g., at  mobilized   \nthe Vietnam National     \nUniversity)     AC minutes; monthly progress \n    report \n(vi) A dedicated website for     \ndisseminating JFPPT     \nprogram and its outputs and  A team of web developers   \na platform for distance  engaged, relevant websites   \nlearning and e-discussions  reviewed and design  AC minutes; monthly progress \n  commenced   report \n(vii) Training materials for  Necessary equipment   \nexecutive short courses in  purchased   \n ", "Appendix 1  7\nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \npublic economic policy     \nmaking   Case studies carried out as  AC minutes; monthly progress \n  necessary; training folders  report  \nprepared.
