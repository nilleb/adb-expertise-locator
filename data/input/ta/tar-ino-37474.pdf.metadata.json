Upon request of the Government of Indonesia, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nfielded a fact-finding mission in March 2004 to formulate an advisory technical assistance (TA)1 \nfor Gender Responsive Public Policy and Administration. The TA will help the Government to \nincrease women\u2019s participation in political decision making and improve gender mainstreaming \nin  policies  and  programs  at  the  regional  level.  The  Project  directly  addresses  the  third \nMillennium Development Goal to reduce gender disparities and promote gender equality and \nempowerment  through  gender  sensitive  programs  and  projects  at  the  district  level.  The \nobjectives, scope, implementation arrangements, cost and financing arrangements, and terms \nof reference for the TA are based on the understanding reached with the Government during the \nmission. The project framework is included in Appendix 1.      \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.   Indonesia has undergone political and social reform since the resignation of President \nSoeharto  in  1998.  This  process  has  been  followed  by  greater  political  participation  and  a \ndemand  for  increased  representation  of  women  in  political  decision  making  processes. \nWomen\u2019s equal participation in the political life is pivotal to their general advancement and \ndemocratic governance. The goals of equality and sustainable development cannot be achieved \nunless women\u2019s perspectives are incorporated into, and women participate actively in, decision \nmaking at all levels. Women\u2019s participation in political decision making is very low.  From 1992 \nto 1997, women held only 12%2 of the seats in the national parliament; in 2004, 11.1%. The \nrepresentation of women in local representative bodies (LRBs)3 remains low, as well: 13% after \nthe election in 2004.   \n \n3.  In February 2003, legislation was passed stating that each participating political party \nmay nominate candidates for the national parliament and the local parliament for each electoral \ndistrict, giving consideration to representation of women of at least 30%. However, the law did \nnot have a significant impact on women\u2019s representation in national representative bodies or in \nLRBs. Women\u2019s representation remains low because (i) few women are involved in political \nparties, (ii) they lack the confidence and skills to operate in public institutions, and (iii) they lack \nawareness of the advantages of women\u2019s national and local representation.    \n \n4.   Gender  equality  does  not  flow  simply  from  increased  participation  of  women  in \nrepresentative bodies. The effectiveness of women\u2019s participation in terms of their ability to \narticulate gender interests and the impact of this on actual resource allocation processes and \ndecisions  are  also  critical.  To  increase  the  effectiveness  of  women\u2019s  participation  in \nrepresentative bodies, the gender perspective must be mainstreamed into all areas of public \nadministration as well. \n \n5.  The introduction of regional autonomy in 2001 resulted in the devolution of substantial \nauthority  and  functions  from  the  central  Government  to  regional  governments.4  Regional \ngovernments are now responsible for ensuring that gender concerns are mainstreamed into all \naspects  of  local  administration.  Regional  autonomy  opens  a  window  of  opportunity  for \nmeaningful  participation of women and for directly  addressing gender disparities at the local \nlevel.  However, many barriers remain, including a lack of awareness, knowledge, and political \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 13 February 2004. \n2  For Asia as a whole, the same figure is 13.4% (2004). \n3  Local representative bodies refer to the district representative bodies and the village representative bodies.  \n4  Regional  governments  refer  to  the  district  administration  and  local  representative  bodies,  including  district \nrepresentative bodies and village representative bodies.   ", "2 \nwill of decision makers at the regional level. These factors contribute to the suppression of \nwomen\u2019s rights and weak follow-up in the implementation of international conventions, such as \nthe Convention to End all Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Beijing Platform for \nAction. Regional governments  lack technical capacity to mainstream gender  equity concerns \ninto policies and programs.   \n  \n6.  Within regional governments, women\u2019s empowerment divisions5 (WEDs) are responsible \nfor ensuring that gender is integrated into planning and policy development of all sectoral offices \n(dinas).6  The  WEDs  provide  technical  input  and  monitor  and  evaluate  the  gender \nresponsiveness of the administration. However, they lack the resources and technical expertise \nto implement this task, leaving sectoral offices without specific and practical support in gender \nmainstreaming. Consequently, approaches addressing gender issues at the district level do not \nfocus on gender disparities or their causes (discrimination, subordination, and lack of access to \nresources  and  services).  Very  often,  the  emphasis  is  on  support  of  women\u2019s  \u201ctraditional\u201d \ndomestic, reproductive, and family welfare responsibilities.7 \n \n7.  District administrations lack understanding of some of the basic concepts of gender \nmainstreaming and equality and of how to practically implement gender sensitive policies and \nprograms. Four basic elements for gender mainstreaming are missing at district level: (i) sex- \ndisaggregated data is not collected to analyze gender gaps; (ii) district administrations, including \nthe WEDs, lack skills in gender analysis; (iii) there are no procedures to monitor and report on \ngender mainstreaming; and (iv) there are no accountability mechanisms to ensure that women \nand men receive a reasonable proportion of local governments\u2019 resources.  \n \n8.  Previous  ADB  assistance  to  strengthen  gender  mainstreaming  capacity  included  a \nsmall-scale TA8 to strengthen the capacity of the State Ministry of Women\u2019s Empowerment \n(SMWE)  to  coordinate,  monitor,  and  evaluate  the  Government\u2019s  plans  to  mainstream  the \nconcern of gender into all sectoral policies, plans, and programs. Another TA9 was to review and \ncompile  data  on  the  sociolegal  status  of  women  in  Indonesia.  ADB  supported  a  TA10  to \nmainstream gender equity concerns into development policies, strategies, program design, and \nimplementation at the district level.11 While this TA succeeded in increasing the capacity of \nregional governments to mainstream gender, the impact of the TA was limited to the four \ndistricts where the TA was implemented. To expand the impact, national-level mechanisms \nshould be developed to facilitate gender mainstreaming regionally on a larger scale. The TA will \nhelp SMWE prepare and adopt a national action plan identifying mechanisms, targets, and \nbudget requirements to support gender mainstreaming in regional governments. The national \naction plan will be based  on  the SMWE\u2019s  national gender mainstreaming strategy for 2004\u2013\n2009. The preparation and adoption of a national action plan for mainstreaming gender at the \nregional level will be an important instrument for ADB and other funding agencies to coordinate \ntheir gender interventions more effectively.        \n \n \n                                                 \n5  WEDs were formed in 2001.  \n6  Dinas are district sector agencies. \n7 Institutionally, the WEDs are still very dependent  on the  State Ministry of Women\u2019s Empowerment (SMWE) for \ntechnical advice and resources to implement their activities.      \n8  ADB. 1993.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n9.  The  goal  of  the  TA  is  to  reduce  gender  inequality  and  empower  women  through \nparticipation and gender mainstreaming. The purpose is to help regional governments increase \nwomen\u2019s participation in political decision making and improve the gender responsiveness of \nregional policies and programs.12     \n \n10.  The TA has three expected outputs. First, the TA aims to increase capacity of women as \npresent members or future candidates of LRBs to influence political decision making. The TA \nwill provide training and help women to organize and mobilize. Second, the TA will ensure \nincreased capacity of district administrations to mainstream gender concerns into design and \nmonitoring and evaluation of programs and projects. Third, the TA will, in cooperation with \nSMWE, prepare a national action plan13 specifying approaches, targets, and resources needed \nto support gender mainstreaming into regional policies, programs and projects.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA consists of the following components: (i) capacity building of women as present \nmembers  or  future  candidates  of  LRBs;  (ii)  capacity  building  of  district  administrations  to \nmainstream gender in design, monitoring, and evaluation of programs and projects; and (iii) \nassistance to the SMWE in preparing and adopting a national action plan based on its existing \nnational gender mainstreaming strategy for 2004\u20132009.     \n \n12.  Under the first component, an inventory will be made of women already in LRBs and of \npotential  female  candidates  for  LRBs.  The  women  identified  will  be  included  in  training \nprograms.14  The training program for potential candidates will include gender and leadership, \ntechnical skills for campaigning, presentation, negotiation, and handling media, and gender \nawareness  in  general.  The  training  program  for  existing  members  of  LRBs  will  focus  on \nleadership  training,  participatory  planning,  and  gender  sensitive  policies  and  programs, \ntechnical issues such as legal support, knowledge of how the legislature works, written and \nunwritten  codes,  and  procedures  and  mechanisms  for  conducting  a  political  agenda.  The \ntraining material will be drawn from existing material prepared by nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs) and research institutions specialized in the areas of gender and governance.  \n \n13.  Existing  women\u2019s  groups  involved  in  politics,  such  as  women\u2019s  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) and caucuses, will be mobilized and organized in each district. The TA \nwill help establish networks between these groups and local grass-roots organizations and \nsimilar groups  to ensure linkages between women in  LRBs and their constituents. The local \nnetworks will act as advocacy or lobby groups for increasing the number of women in LRBs and \nfor implementing gender responsive policies and programs. The local networks will connect to \nthe national level, with caucuses and organizations, such as the Parliamentarian Forum on \nPopulation and Development. Best practices on how female politicians have managed to make \na difference through legislation will be documented. The local networks will use these best \npractices in their advocacy or lobby work.   \n                                                 \n12 Three districts will be selected from among the 40 districts where the proposed ADB-supported loan project Local \nGovernment Finance and Governance Reform Program, will be implemented. The districts will be selected based \non the following criteria: (i) the existence of a well-established women\u2019s empowerment unit, and (ii) political \ncommitment from regional governments to implement the TA. \n13 SMWE will develop a new national action plan in 2005 to replace the one covering 2000\u20132005.   \n14 The TA will develop clear and transparent selection criteria for women to be included in the training activities. ", "4 \n14.  The second component of the TA will increase the capacity of district administrations to \ndesign,  monitor,  and  evaluate  gender  responsive  projects  and  programs.  This  component \nincludes  the  establishment  of  gender-disaggregated  data  collection  from  selected  sectoral \noffices so that locally relevant gender issues can be identified. The data will form the basis of a \nreport on gender inequalities in the district, to be submitted by the WEDs regularly to the elected \nhead of the local government (bupati) and the LRBs. This component will strengthen the WEDs\u2019 \nability to apply practical approaches to gender analysis in their daily work. This will include skills \nin  information  collection,  gender  sensitive  regulations,  participatory  planning,  and  gender \nsensitive indicators (particularly with respect to monitoring local development targets and the \nmillennium development goals). The training will also include participants from selected sectoral \noffices, especially from the district planning board15 and gender focal points from other sectoral \noffices. Finally, a monitoring mechanism will be established in order to track how sectoral offices \nare mainstreaming gender into their programs.      \n \n15.  The TA will implement gender responsive budgeting16 in the project areas. This will \ncontribute to effective public spending and good governance by improving the delivery of goods \nand  services  to  women  and  men  in  a  just  and  responsible  manner.  The  TA  will  identify \nmodalities to support the proposed ADB-supported loan project, local government finance and \ngovernance reform program (the reform program). Gender responsive budgeting will support the \nreform  program  by  facilitating  enhanced  transparency,  accountability,  efficiency,  and \neffectiveness in the delivery of basic regional services. An important part of gender responsive \nbudgets is enhancing participation of communities in planning and preparing the budget. Village \nworkshops will be held in the three districts to increase budget literacy of women, in particular. \nThe  TA  will  provide  training  of  relevant  sectoral  offices  (including  the  WEDs)  in  gender \nresponsive budgeting. Such budgeting will then be replicated in all the districts where the reform \nprogram is going to be implemented.   \n \n16.  The third component of the TA consists of preparing a national action plan for SMWE. \nThe action plan will identify (i) targets for mainstreaming gender at the local level for the next 3 \nyears,  (ii)  milestones  and  gender  indicators to  monitor  and  evaluate  progress,  (iii)  gender \ncapacity-building requirements over the next 3 years for the effective implementation of the \nSMWE\u2019s national gender mainstreaming strategy, and (iv) resources needed to implement the \nnational action plan.      \n  \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 equivalent, comprising $238,000 in \nforeign exchange cost and $262,000 in local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 by the Government of the United Kingdom17 and \nadministered by ADB. The Government will provide $100,000 equivalent in the form of office \nand support facilities, counterpart staff, administrative support, part of workshop expenses, and \nlocal transportation for counterpart staff. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are \nshown in Appendix 2.    \n  \n \n \n                                                 \n15 The district planning board decides the development priorities and approves funding for plans that comply with \nthese priorities.  \n16 Gender responsive budgets introduce gender (as well as other categories like ethnicity, socioeconomic groups, \netc.) as crosscutting criteria into planning activities and the allocation of resources.  The preparation of gender \nresponsive budgets will be based on experiences from Loan 1964-INO (ADB. 2002. Sustainable Capacity Building \nfor Decentralization Project. Manila) where these budgets are being introduced in some of the project areas.  \n17  Provided by the Department for International Development (DFID). \n   ", "5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n18.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be SMWE.  NGOs specializing in women in politics \nwill provide training packages and conduct training for women in LRBs and potential women \ncandidates.  A  coordination  unit  with  representatives  from  the  WED,  district  development \nplanning board, bureau of statistics, and key local representative members will be established in \neach of the three districts to oversee TA implementation. Detailed terms of reference for the \ncoordination units will be developed and agreed to at the inception meeting. The project director \nwill be identified by SMWE before the commencement of the TA.  The project director, whom \nthe SMWE will identify before the TA starts, will provide the overall coordination. The TA \nconsultants will be located at SMWE and in the three selected districts.  \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months from March 2005 to March 2006 and will \nrequire 40 person-months of consulting services, including 10 person-months for international \nconsultants and 24 person-months for domestic consultants engaged by the SMWE through a \nconsulting firm. The TA also includes 6 unallocated person-months for recruiting NGOs. The \nconsultants will be engaged in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by \nAsian Development Bank and its Borrowers using the quality- and cost-based selection method, \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. All \nprocurement under the TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The \nSMWE will be responsible for providing the agreed counterpart resources. The proposed terms \nof reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n20.  The consultants will prepare (i) an inception report, including a detailed work program \nwithin the first month; (ii) monthly progress reports; (iii) a midterm review report after 7 months; \n(iv) a draft final report; and (v) a final report within 1 month after receiving comments on the draft \nfinal report. Tripartite review meetings between SMWE, the consultants and the ADB will be \nheld after inception and at the draft final report stage. The consultants will also be responsible \nfor preparing technical reports as specified in Appendix 3. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 to the Government \nof Indonesia to be financed on a grant  basis by  the  Government of the United Kingdom for \nGender Responsive Public Policy and Administration, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard.
