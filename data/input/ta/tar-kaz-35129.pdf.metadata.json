The  Government  of  Kazakhstan  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for \ntechnical assistance (TA) to prepare the Second Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector \nProject. The TA is included in the 2005\u20132007 country strategy and program update.1 Fact-\nfinding was undertaken in May 2005 and an understanding was reached with the Government \non the impact and outcome, scope, cost and financing, implementation arrangements, and \nterms of reference for the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Government has accorded high priority to ensuring public access to safe drinking \nwater  which  meets  international  standards.  In  particular,  rural  water  supply  services  need \nimprovement\u2014both in terms of quality and quantity. According to the United Nations Human \nDevelopment Report 2003,2 one third of the rural population does not have access to safe \ndrinking water. Only 9% of the rural population has access to water pipelines and 91% use local \npoint sources such as wells (including artesian) and springs. There are few working wastewater \ncollection  systems  or  acceptable  levels  of  human  waste  disposal  in  rural  areas.  Most \nwastewater  is  discharged  to  the  nearest  waterways  without  treatment.  Banyas  (public \nbathhouses) in many villages have largely fallen into disuse due to lack of water supply. \n \n3.  Much of the existing rural water supply system has gradually become inoperative. This \nnetwork is the only source of drinking water for many villages, connected by thousands of \nkilometers of water mains. Almost all infrastructure\u2014water intakes, water distribution networks, \npumping stations, and water treatment plants\u2014was constructed in the 1960s and 1970s and is \nseverely deteriorated. Outdated technology, as well as limited maintenance and repair work \nover the decades, has created serious inefficiencies that make the current water supply systems \nunsustainable. \n \n4.  Kazakhstan\u2019s water supply systems are further aggravated by poor water quality. About \n50% of the population uses drinking water that does not meet established standards of salinity, \nmineralization, and hardness. Insufficient wastewater management exacerbates the problem of \nsurface and groundwater pollution. Water-borne diseases such as dysentery, typhoid fever, and \nviral infections have increased in recent years parallel with deteriorating quality of drinking \nwater. \n \n5.  There are few functioning rural sanitation systems. Only a few raion (district) centers \nhave  sewerage  systems,  which  collect  wastewater  and  dispose  of  it  without  treatment. \nElsewhere, wastewater is disposed of on the ground around the house or in a septic tank. \nPrivate  toilets  usually  comprise  simple  non-sanitary  pit  latrines,  which  are  dilapidated  and \nreplaced when full. Most school and hospital latrines are also in poor condition. \n \n6.  The Committee for Water Resources (CWR) under the Ministry of Agriculture directly \nmanages the use and protection of water sources at the national level. The CWR is responsible \nfor  rural  water  supply  development,  irrigation,  drainage,  river  basin  water  resources \nmanagement, transboundary natural waters, and water use permits. The CWR provides advice \non establishing or revising laws and regulations concerning use, management, protection, and \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004.

In addition, CWR is the main implementing \nagency for locally or externally funded rural water supply and irrigation projects. \n \n7.  The Government developed the Potable Water Sector Program 2002\u20132010 in January \n2002. The program emphasizes (i) development of groundwater resources; (ii) provision of \nwater  supply  services  to  different  social  groups;  (iii) improvement  of  water  quality; \n(iv) strengthening  of  water  resources  protection;  (v)  gradual  transfer  from  non-redeemable \nbudget funding towards credit, with subsequent decentralization of investment; and (vi) water \nconsumers\u2019 compliance with water legislation. \n \n8.  The project area will cover East Kazakhstan oblast (province), Pavlodar oblast, and \nAlmaty oblast. In East Kazakhstan oblast, 667,000 rural inhabitants live in 856 rural settlements3 \nin  15  raions.  Centralized  water  supply  systems  serve  218  rural  settlements,  623  use \ndecentralized systems, and 15 are supplied by water tanks. In Pavlodar oblast, 291,000 rural \ninhabitants live in 509 rural settlements in 13 raions. Centralized water supply systems are used \nin 97 rural settlements, 392 are served by decentralized systems, and 20 use water tanks. In \nAlmaty oblast, 1,218,000 rural inhabitants live in 824 rural settlements in 19 raions. Centralized \nwater supply systems serve 398 rural settlements, 414 use decentralized water sources, and 13 \nare supplied by water tanks. \n \n9.  In 2003, ADB approved the Rural Area Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project,4 \nwhich will help improve living and health conditions for more than half a million people in rural \nareas by providing basic water supply and sanitation infrastructure and services. The loan \nbecame  effective  on  2  August  2005.  ADB  also  approved  two  small-scale  TA  projects  for \ninstitutional strengthening of the Committee for Water Resources (2004) and strengthening the \nwater supply sector program (2005).5 Fieldwork for the institutional strengthening project started \nin May 2005 and a final report will be submitted in November 2005. The Islamic Development \nBank (IDB), in collaboration with ADB, is helping provide water to rural Karagandy, promoting a \ncommon strategic approach. The Japan International Cooperation Agency is providing materials \nand  equipment  for  rural  water  supply  in  North  Kazakhstan.  World  Bank  assistance  in \nKazakhstan has been focused on urban water supply. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The TA will prepare a project to improve the living and health conditions of selected rural \nsettlements suitable for ADB financing in the project area covering East Kazakhstan oblast, \nPavlodar oblast, and Almaty oblast. The project area was selected because of (i) low water \nconsumption  due  to  lack  of  access  to  water,  (ii)  insufficient  water  supply  systems,  and \n(iii) deterioration  of  water  supply  and  sanitation  systems.  The  proposed  project  will  fulfill \nimmediate demand for drinking water supply and safe sanitation services in the project area by \n(i) upgrading water supply infrastructure and services (including levels of service and coverage); \n(ii) providing adequate sanitation services (including wastewater drainage facilities, school and \n                                                 \n3  Rural settlements are defined as settlements with more than 50 people, in which no less than half of the population \nis engaged in the agriculture sector. \n4  ADB. 2003.

Impacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous \npeoples are not expected to be significant. It is envisaged that the proposed project may require \nsmall  areas  of  land  for  small  groundwater  pumping  stations  and  storage  tanks.  However, \nassessment will be carried out under the TA and, if necessary, mitigation measures/plans will be \nprepared and included in the project design. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  A sector loan approach will be applied to the proposed project. To qualify for funding, \ninterested local governments will be required to show their willingness to participate actively in \nsubproject  planning,  implementation,  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  by  fulfilling  a \nseries  of  pre-project  conditions  to  be  identified  under  the  TA.  Feasibility  studies  will  be \nconducted under the TA for four core subprojects. The TA will use the available sector study \nresults and focus on identifying concrete measures that can be readily operationalized. The \nproposed measures will be discussed with key government officials and other stakeholders. The \nTA will follow the Government\u2019s feasibility study requirements for budget investment projects \nand  programs6  as  well  as  ADB  project  preparation  guidelines.  Lessons  learned  from  the \nexperience in implementing the Rural Area Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project will be \nincorporated in the design of the proposed project. \n \n12.  Although the exact scope of the proposed project will be determined upon completion of \nthe TA, the project is expected to comprise two parts: Part A\u2014Physical Infrastructure and \nPart B\u2014Institutional Development. Part A will include development and rehabilitation of water \nsupply systems, wastewater facilities, school and hospital latrines, and bathhouses. Part B will \ninclude capacity building and education programs. \n \n13.  The  TA  will  review  socioeconomic  conditions,  and  water  supply  and  sanitation \ninfrastructure and service delivery in the project area. The review will include (i) an assessment \nof physical, institutional, and human resources required for implementation of the proposed \nproject; and (ii) description of the present facilities, planned future coverage, cost recovery, \nO&M arrangements, private sector involvement, and related policies. Particular attention will be \npaid  to  integrated  water  resources  management  and  environmental  concerns  to  ensure \nprotection of water resources at regional and local levels. \n \n14.  The TA will consider (i) the possibility of transition (if necessary) from long-distance \nwater pipelines, which are inefficient to operate and costly to maintain, to decentralized local \nwater  supply  systems;  (ii)  use  of  modern  water  treatment  and  distribution  technology; \n(iii) environmentally  friendly  and  low-cost  alternatives  for  sanitation  and  wastewater \nmanagement  techniques,  such  as  on-plot  and  on-block  treatment  systems;  and  (iv)  more \neffective O&M for the improved water supply systems at raion and settlement levels. The \nfeasibility study for the core physical infrastructure subprojects will cover (i) preparation of \npreliminary engineering designs and cost estimates, (ii) assessment of financial and economic \nviability  and  sustainability,  (iii)  assessment  of  environmental  and  social  soundness, \n(iv) development of a design and monitoring framework and implementation arrangements, and \n(v) establishment of criteria and guidelines to select subprojects to be proposed by interested \nlocal governments. The TA will also formulate an institutional development program including \n                                                 \n6 Ministry of Economy and Budget Planning. 2004.

Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $930,000 equivalent, comprising $445,000 in \nforeign exchange costs and $485,000 equivalent in local currency costs. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $650,000 equivalent covering the entire foreign exchange costs and \n$205,000 equivalent in local currency costs. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will finance the \nbalance of the local currency cost, equivalent to $280,000, by providing office space, utilities, \nlocal communications, administrative support, and counterpart staff. Detailed cost estimates are \nin Appendix 3. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit \nADB to finance any proposed project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The Ministry of Agriculture will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will provide \npolicy guidance, facilitate interagency coordination, and resolve any institutional problems. CWR \nwill be the Implementing Agency and will oversee day-to-day TA implementation. CWR will also \nprovide a furnished office for the consultant, with utilities, telecommunication access, materials, \nmaps, data, and all required project documents. CWR will appoint a senior officer as project \nmanager, assisted by other qualified counterpart staff.  \n \n17.  The TA will require 13 person-months of international and 70 person-months of domestic \nconsulting services. The international consultants will include a water supply and sanitation \nspecialist/team leader (5 person-months), an economic analyst (2 person-months), a financial \nmanagement specialist/financial analyst (2 person-months), a social development/community \nparticipation specialist (2 person-months), an environmental specialist (1 person-month), and a \nresettlement specialist (1 person-month). The domestic consultants will include a water supply \nand sanitation engineer/deputy team leader (6 person-months), a water supply and wastewater \nengineer (5 person-months), a financial analyst (5 person-months), an economist (5 person-\nmonths),  civil  engineers  (8  person-months,  2  positions),  an  electrical  engineer  (4  person-\nmonths), a hydro-geological engineer (4 person-months), design engineers (8 person-months, 2 \npositions), a cost estimate engineer (4 person-months), an institutional development specialist \n(5 person-months), an environment specialist (5 person-months), a community participation \nspecialist  (5  person-months),  a  gender  and  poverty  specialist  (4  person-months),  and  a \nresettlement  specialist  (2  person-months).  ADB  will  select  and  engage  consultants  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB for the selection and engagement of domestic consultants. The quality and cost-based \nselection  method  using  simplified  technical  proposal  procedures  will  be  followed.  The \nconsultants  may  procure  equipment  through  direct  purchase  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. Upon completion of the TA, equipment procured under the TA will \nbe transferred to CWR. The consultants will hold workshops on the proposed project\u2019s planning \nand design with the participation of related government agencies and local communities. Outline \nterms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4. \n \n ", "  5\n18.  The TA will be implemented over 6 months, from January to June 2006. The major \nreports required from the consultants are (i) an inception report describing the detailed work \nprogram within 3 weeks of TA start, (ii) an interim report within 3 months of TA start, (iii) a draft \nfinal report within 5 months of TA start, and (iv) a final report at TA completion. Tripartite \nmeetings will be held with the Government, ADB, and the consultants to discuss the TA reports. \nA final report will be submitted 2 weeks after receiving comments from the Government and \nADB. All reports will be prepared in both English and Russian. A separate feasibility study report \nwill be prepared in Russian, in accordance with the Government\u2019s feasibility study requirements \nfor budget investment projects and programs. \n \nIV.
