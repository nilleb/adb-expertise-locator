The proposed project will support the government of Cambodia in improving urban \nservices and enhancing climate resilience in four participating towns in the Tonle Sap Basin.1 \nThe  project  will  support  urban  infrastructure  investments,  including  drainage  and  flood \nprotection,  wastewater  treatment  and  management  and  solid  waste  management,  in  the \nmunicipalities of Steung Sen, Serei Saophoan, Kampong Chhnang and Pursat.2 By enhancing \ndrainage and flood protection, the project will improve climate resilience and adaption capacity \nin the four towns. The project will also improve climate resilient urban planning and disaster risk \nmanagement and strengthen institutional capacity for sector coordination and managing public \ninvestments.  \n \n2.  A project preparation technical assistance (PPTA) is needed for the preparation of (i) \nfeasibility studies and (ii) detailed design and bidding documents, for selected subprojects under \nthe project; a (iii) capacity development plan for Steung Sen and Serei Saophoan and (iv) a \nconsolidated proposal and procurement plan. The PPTA will directly build on pre-feasibility \nstudies (PFS) to be conducted under the Cities Development Initiative for Asia (CDIA), between \nOctober 2016 and May 2017.3  \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n3.  The  activities  and  outputs  under  the  PPTA  are  organized  into  four  components, \nsummarized below.  \n \n4.  Component  1:  Development  of  feasibility  studies.  The  consultant  will  develop \nfeasibility studies for selected subprojects under Output 1 and Output 2. The selection of Output \n1 subprojects that would be developed to feasibility level will be confirmed as part of the pre-\nfeasibility study.  \n \n5.  Component  2:  Development  of  detailed  design  and  bidding  documents.  The \nconsultant will develop detailed design and bidding documents for selected subprojects under \nOutput 1. Consultants will carry out all necessary surveys\u2014including detailed topographical and \nsoil surveys, field verification, studies, collection of data, and analyses needed to prepare the \ndetailed engineering designs and contract documents for the subprojects. The consultants will \nprepare detailed designs and cost estimates\u2014accurate to plus or minus five percent\u2014and \nprepare  bidding  documents  in  line  with  the  procurement  plan.  The  selection  of  Output  1 \nsubprojects that would be developed to detailed design level will be confirmed as part of the \npre-feasibility study, and will  include those sub projects which are assessed as being the \nhighest priority investments across the four towns.   \n \n6.  Component 3: Capacity building program. The consultant will develop a capacity \nbuilding program to be adopted and implemented under Output 3 of the project. The purpose of \nthe program will be to train staff for the effective and efficient implementation of the project, \nmanagement  of  urban  services,  operations  and  maintenance  of  the  project  facilities,  and \n                                                \n1  The project is included in ADB. 2015.
