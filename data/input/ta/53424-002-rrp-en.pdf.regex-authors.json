THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased loan to Papua New Guinea (PNG) for subprogram 2 of the State-Owned Enterprises \nReform Program. \n \n2.  The program, comprising three subprograms, targets improvements in the operational \nperformance and financial sustainability of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and helps strengthen \nservice delivery. Policy reforms improve the legislative and policy framework for SOEs, the \ngovernance and transparency of SOEs, and financial sustainability of specific SOEs. Policy \nactions achieved under subprogram 1 have been sustained and are built upon by subprogram 2 \nactions. All 16 actions in subprogram 2 have been completed.  \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Economic and fiscal performance. PNG is a highly resource-dependent country, with \nexports of liquefied natural gas, gold, and other mineral resources accounting for 81.3% of goods \nexports and 34.0% of gross domestic product (GDP) during 2015\u20122020. Together with its high \nexposure to natural hazards, including from the country\u2019s location on the Pacific Ring of Fire, the \ncountry  is  prone  to  frequent  shocks  that  undermine  economic  performance  and  human \ndevelopment. In recent years, volatile global commodity prices, droughts, and a large earthquake \nin 2018 have affected PNG\u2019s economic performance. Following the recovery in energy and \nmineral production that led to GDP growth of 5.9% in 2019, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \npandemic pushed the economy into a recession in 2020, with output estimated to have shrunk by \n3.3% in 2020, 5.4 percentage points below pre-COVID-19 estimates. While official COVID-19 \nnumbers of 27,895 confirmed cases and 335 deaths as of 24 October 2021 are low in global \nterms, testing rates are also low and so the full impact of COVID-19 is unknown.1 Indirect impacts \non an already fragile health system, nascent private sector, and weak public sector are considered \nsignificant and ongoing. As of 24 October 2021, 223,263 people (4.5% of the adult population) \nhave received at least one vaccine dose, and 147,831 (3.0% of the adult population) are fully \nvaccinated.2 \n \n4.  Frequent large shocks feed through to the country\u2019s fiscal situation, where limited public \nadministration capacity, multilayered institutional arrangements across government levels, and a \ncomplex political economy compound the effects. Following a period of expansionary fiscal policy, \nthe government started fiscal consolidation efforts in 2016 that led to a substantial narrowing of \nthe fiscal deficit to 2.5% of GDP in 2017 and 2.6% in 2018. With lower than expected revenue \ncollection, including because of low global commodity prices and substantial arrears payments, \nthe fiscal deficit increased again to 5.0% of GDP in 2019. In February 2020, the government \nentered into a Staff-Monitored Program (SMP) with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).3 Under \n \n1  Department of Health and World Health Organization (accessed 17 October 2021).Coronavirus Disease 2019 \n(COVID-19) Health Situation Report #96 (25 October 2021). Port Moresby. \n2  The slow vaccine uptake is due to a number of factors including delays at the national level in preparing applications \nfor the first vaccine supply, small multiple donations across various bilateral partners making it challenging to \ncoordinate at the central level, limited number of vaccination sites in the provinces because of overstretched and \nunderfunded health systems, and widespread vaccine hesitancy, including among health workers. \n3  IMF. 2020. Papua New Guinea: 2019 Article IV Consultation and Request for Staff Monitored Program\u2014Press \nRelease, Staff Report, and Statement by the Executive Director for Papua New Guinea. IMF Country Report. No. \n20/95. Washington, DC. The SMP includes measures and targets to tighten expenditure controls, reinvigorate \nrevenue reforms, restore exchange rate flexibility, initiate SOE reforms, and deal with corruption. \n \n ", "2 \nthe SMP, the fiscal deficit was projected to narrow to less than 2.0% of GDP in the medium term, \nachieving primary surpluses to reduce public debt to less than 40.0% of GDP by 2026. However, \nthe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has undermined consolidation efforts, driving up the fiscal \ndeficit to 8.9% of GDP in 2020. As a result, public debt increased by 9 percentage points to reach \n49.1% of GDP in 2020, pushing PNG into being at high risk of external and overall debt distress.4 \n \n5.  The general direction of PNG\u2019s macroeconomic policies is considered adequate, although \nsubject to significant risks. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) assesses debt to be sustainable \nover the medium term, based on the government\u2019s commitment to fiscal stabilization.5 The \ngovernment plans to reduce recurrent expenditure gradually as COVID-19-related expenditures \ndecline, while tax revenues are expected to pick up as economic activity is restored. The fiscal \ndeficit is projected to be 7.1% of GDP in 2021 before narrowing to 2.1% by 2024, stabilizing public \ndebt slightly above 50.0% of GDP in the medium term (Table 1). As part of the IMF SMP linked \nto budget support under its Rapid Credit Facility, the government is implementing monetary policy \nmeasures, which include strengthening liquidity management and monetary operations, clearing \na backlog of unfilled foreign exchange orders at banks, and gradually restoring kina convertibility \nand flexibility (footnote 3). Annual growth is forecast to be 1.3% for 2021 and is expected to \nrecover to about 4.0% per year during 2022\u20122024. However, this outlook is associated with a \nhigh degree of uncertainty. In the near term, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, aggravated by a \nlow vaccination rate and spreading and emerging variants, threatens the projected gradual \nrecovery, requiring continued high alert levels from government authorities. In the medium term, \na planned new liquefied natural gas project that could start in 2023 and would see investments of \nmore than $10 billion is an upside risk and could lift growth substantially over several years. \n \nTable 1: Selected Economic and Fiscal Indicators \n(% of GDP, unless otherwise indicated) \nItem  2018  2019  2020  2021f  2022f  2023f  2024f \nReal GDP growth (% change)  (0.3)  5.9   (3.3)  1.3   4.1   3.7   3.8  \nChange in CPI (% annual average)  4.7   3.6   4.9   4.0   4.4   4.1   3.0  \n C  entral government budget                                    \n  Total revenue  17.7   16.3   14.8   14.0   14.7   16.2   17.0  \n    Tax revenue  13.2   13.0   12.0   11.9   12.3   13.8   14.7  \n    Nontax revenue  2.2   1.2   1.1   0.9   1.4   1.4   1.2  \n    Grants  2.3   2.1   1.7   1.1   1.1   1.0   1.0  \n  Total expenditure  20.3   21.2   23.7   21.1   19.9   19.4   19.1  \n    Recurrent  14.4   14.0   15.3   13.0   11.9   11.4   11.1  \n    Capital  5.9   7.2   8.4   8.0   8.0   8.0   8.0  \n  Fiscal balance  (2.6)  (5.0)  (8.9)  (7.1)  (5.2)  (3.2)  (2.1) \n  Primary balance  (0.1)  (2.4)  (6.3)  (4.7)  (3.0)  (0.8)  0.5  \nPublic debt  34.2   40.0   49.1   49.9   50.4   52.5   51.7  \n  of which: external debt  12.6   17.0   22.0   24.9   24.6   25.3   24.9  \n N  ominal GDP ($ billion)  22 . 0   23 . 4   24 . 3   23 . 3   26 . 0   28  .1   28 . 2  \n( ) = negative, CPI = consumer price index, f = forecast, GDP = gross domestic product. \nSources: Asian Development Bank, International Monetary Fund, and Papua New Guinea Department of Treasury \nestimates. \n \n6.

The IMF \nprojects gradual fiscal consolidation and also assesses public debt to be on a sustainable path under the baseline of \nfiscal consolidation and economic recovery. \n \n ", "3 \nenergy, water supply, telecommunications, ports, and air transport\u2014are provided through SOEs.6 \nThe performance of SOEs has budgetary implications for the government and for the costs of \ndelivering services to the economy. Kumul Consolidated Holdings (KCH) is the holding company \nfor the government\u2019s non-resource sector assets through the General Business Trust (GBT).7 The \nGBT owns government shares in nine SOEs, regulated by the Kumul Consolidated Holdings \nAuthorisation Act 2002 as amended (KCH Act).8 KCH is the trustee of the GBT and oversees \nSOE performance. KCH reports to the National Executive Council (NEC), which comprises all \nministers, through the minister for state enterprises, who is responsible for all policy matters \nrelated to the SOE portfolio. \n \n7.  SOEs consistently demonstrate poor operational and financial performance. Incomplete \nfinancial data indicate that the overall profitability of SOEs has declined since 2015, with COVID-\n19 intensifying losses. In 2020, SOEs in the GBT reported unaudited consolidated net operating \nprofits before tax of K11.9 million, a reduction by 90% from K120.8 million in 2019. Air Niugini \nLimited (ANL), the national airline carrier, was particularly impacted by COVID-19, increasing its \n(unaudited) net operating loss after tax from K25.0 million in 2019 to K97.1 million in 2020. Kumul \nTelikom Holdings Limited (KTH) and PNG Power Limited (PPL) also performed poorly financially \nin 2020, with (unaudited) net operating losses after tax of K56.7 million for KTH and K48.4 million \nfor PPL. In 2020, selected SOEs, including PNG Ports Corporation Limited, Water PNG Limited, \nand Motor Vehicles Insurance Limited, generated small net operating profits after tax, providing \na total of K78.1 million to the government, down from K89.2 million in 2019.9 \n \n8.  Given the important (and often monopolistic) role that SOEs have in delivering services, \ntheir  continued  weak  performance  results  in  expensive,  inefficient,  and  low-quality  service \nprovision and makes the economy less competitive. For example, only 47% of the population had \naccess to an improved drinking water source in 2020 while only 23% were able to use an improved \nsanitation facility.10 While still turning a profit, Water PNG\u2019s share of nonrevenue water (a key \nmeasure of the efficiency of a water utility) remained high at 39% in 2020 because of substantial \nphysical losses and unmetered water use. Latest available data on electricity use shows that only \nhalf of the population had access to electricity in 2017.11 Average electricity prices are higher than \nin countries with higher household purchasing power, and grid reliability is low because of \nfrequent  failures  in  distribution  lines,  transformers,  and  generators,  stemming  from  poor \nmaintenance and underinvestment.12 On the public sector side, inefficient SOEs are a substantial \ndrain on scarce public funds and some SOE debts represent a contingent liability and expose the \ngovernment to fiscal risk.13 \n \n6  Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management (accessible from list of linked documents in Appendix \n2). \n7  The government is also the majority shareholder in two resource companies: Kumul Petroleum Holdings and Kumul \nMineral Holdings. \n8  Government of PNG. 2021.

Port Moresby. \n13 Only SOE debt that has been guaranteed by the government and has been called upon is recorded in the \ngovernment\u2019s consolidated debt figures in the budget. Several SOE loans have been contracted without NEC \napproval, and more than half without adequate economic and financial viability assessments. \n \n ", "4 \n9.  Key  constraints\u2014regulatory  framework  for  state-owned  enterprises.  The  weak \npolicy and legal framework governing operational performance of SOEs contributes to poor SOE \nperformance. The KCH Act previously did not provide the required clarity on the role of KCH to \nmonitor SOE performance, and on corporate planning and accountability requirements for SOEs. \nEfficiency and profitability were not emphasized as SOE objectives. Before the 2021 amendments \nto the KCH Act passed under this subprogram, inadequate legislative frameworks provided \nconsiderable scope for political considerations to override commercial imperatives, including \naffecting board composition of government majority-owned SOEs. A competition policy aiming to \nimprove  economic  efficiency  and  increase  consumer  welfare  through  the  promotion  and \nmaintenance of fair and effective competition in all markets in PNG\u2019s economy was approved \nunder subprogram 1. Policy implementation has commenced but remains to be completed. \n \n10.  Corporate governance. As a result of multiple responsibilities, political interference, and \ninsufficient capacity, KCH has not been discharging its SOE oversight functions effectively. This \nhas contributed to the lack of timely and transparent reporting and disclosure by SOEs, which in \nturn further reduces accountability and performance. Most SOEs have not produced timely annual \nfinancial statements, resulting in a major accounting backlog. Subprogram 1 started addressing \nthese gaps but further efforts are required to clear remaining financial reporting and audit \nbacklogs. For several SOEs, audited financial statements for 2018 were not available at the end \nof 2020. KTH entities and ANL had an even greater backlog at that time, with statements pending \nfrom 2015 onward for KTH and for 2016 onward for ANL. Audited annual financial statements \nhave not been publicly available, nor have annual reports for KCH and the GBT. This precludes \neffective management decision-making and board and shareholder oversight.  \n \n11.  Limited legislative guidance previously provided under the KCH Act resulted in little focus \nbeing given to selecting and evaluating the performance of board members and management. As \na result, the boards and management of SOEs have lacked qualified and experienced personnel \nand some appointments have been made through nontransparent processes, further reducing \nthe quality of oversight and corporate governance. A lack of diversity has also been evident, with \nonly 4% of board directors being female in 2019. SOE planning processes are weak and annual \noperating plans are often delayed. Most SOEs do not prepare statements of corporate intent or \nsystematically  develop  key  performance  indicators.  Initial  progress  was  achieved  under \nsubprogram 1, with seven of the nine SOEs preparing annual operating plans that the NEC \nsubsequently  approved,  and  new  guidelines  for  improved  corporate  planning  and  director \nselection were introduced by KCH. Further improvements are needed to implement the corporate \nplanning guidelines across all SOEs and improve their performance management and oversight. \nProcurement processes in some SOEs, including in PPL, are not sufficiently robust, leading to \ncorruption risks and poor value for money. \n \n12.  Financial challenges of specific state-owned enterprises. The community service \nobligation (CSO) policy, approved by the NEC in 2012 to provide a framework for identifying and \nfinancing noncommercial services rather than the current practice of opaque cross-subsidization, \nhas not been implemented. Unpaid bills from government clients\u2014particularly for utilities and air \ntransport\u2014continue  to  present  challenges  to  reducing  losses  and  managing  cash  flows. \nAccumulated arrears from government were K365 million in the first half of 2021. At the same \ntime, SOEs such as ANL and KCH hold noncore assets, diverting attention and resources away \nfrom their  core mandates.  Some  SOEs  have high  debt  exposure  and  have  pursued  risky \ncommercial opportunities in the absence of functioning oversight and procurement processes. \nThe consolidated SOE debt was estimated to be K5.1 billion as of the end of December 2020, of \nwhich K1.9 billion was commercial debt. The top three SOEs in terms of debt exposure at the end \nof 2020 were KTH (K1.36 billion), PPL (K1.18 billion), and PNG Ports Corporation (K1.02 billion). \n \n ", "5 \n13.  Public\u2013private partnerships. The regulatory framework for public\u2013private partnerships \n(PPPs) remains  weak, with  corporate responsibilities  for  PPPs moving  between ministries, \ncreating uncertainty and lack of ownership. Since the passing of the Public Private Partnership \nAct in 2014 (PPP Act), its decision-making bodies\u2014the PPP Steering Group and its committees \n(intended  to  promote,  coordinate,  and  analyze  PPP  arrangements)\u2014are  yet  to  be  fully \nimplemented. This hinders the mobilization of private sector capital for building and operating \npublic infrastructure. Subprogram 1 supported the drafting of regulations for the existing PPP Act \nas a first step to establishing an effective regulatory framework. There remain further legislative \nweaknesses that require an amendment to the PPP Act. Some SOEs operate in technologically \nfast-developing and globalizing environments and could benefit from expertise brought in through \nstrategic PPPs to enter new markets while ensuring they remain competitive. \n \n14.  Government  reform  strategy.  The  government  aims  to  improve  the  operational \nperformance of SOEs, with the broader objective of delivering services across PNG at high quality \nand affordable prices.14 Accordingly, the NEC approved an SOE reform blueprint in November \n2019, laying out reforms to be undertaken across SOEs in 2019\u20132022, to strengthen overarching \ncorporate governance and policies and tackle SOE-specific challenges. The government also \nemphasizes the need for SOEs to be accountable and financially sustainable and recognizes the \nkey constraints in improving SOE performance (paras. 9\u201313). The ongoing program is aligned \nwith the government\u2019s SOE reform blueprint. \n \n15.  Consistency with ADB strategy. The program is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 \noperational  priorities  of  strengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity  (including  SOE \nreforms to improve service delivery) and accelerating progress in gender equality.15 With the aim \nof improving service delivery and financial performance of SOEs, the program strengthens \ngovernance and institutional capacity through completing and implementing policy and regulatory \nframeworks for SOEs, competition, and PPPs. Reform targets include strengthening the corporate \ngovernance of individual SOEs and their oversight. Several reforms accelerate gender equality, \nincluding by increasing the representation of women on SOE boards, strengthening reporting on \ngender indicators, and carrying out gender analysis for new investments for essential services \n(paras. 37\u201239). The program aligns with the priorities of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for \nPNG, 2021\u20132025 under which ADB supports SOE reform, business environment improvement, \nand greater competition.16 It is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for PNG, \n2021\u20132023.17 \n \nB.  Policy Reform, ADB\u2019s Value Addition, and Sustainability \n \n16.  Policy reform. The policy actions for the program cover three reform areas: legislative \nand policy framework strengthened, governance and transparency enhanced, and financial \nsustainability of specific SOEs improved. Subprogram 2 contains 16 policy actions, all of which \nhave been completed. The actions in subprogram 2 continue the foundational reforms achieved \nin subprogram 1, which commenced key legislative amendments for SOEs and PPPs, supported \nthe development of a range of new policies (including for SOE ownership and competition) and \nguidelines,  started  addressing  corporate  governance  shortcomings  of  SOEs,  and  initiated \ntransactions by specific SOEs. Subprogram 2 takes forward legislative changes to institutionalize \n \n14 Government of Papua New Guinea. 2018. Medium Term Development Plan III 2018\u20132022. Port Moresby. \n15 ADB. 2018.

Subprogram 3 will complete the regulatory framework for competition and PPPs, continue \nto institute improved corporate governance practices in SOEs (including clearing the remaining \nbacklog of SOE audited financial reports), and further implement transactions and reforms of \nselected SOEs. Reform targets have been developed to address key development constraints, \nbased on government priorities and capacity and considering possible continued COVID-19 \ndisruptions. \n \n17.  Some changes have been made to indicative actions as a result of COVID-19 impacts \nand latest technical information, and those changes are outlined in each reform area. Indicative \nreform actions for subprogram 3 have also been modified to reflect changes in subprogram 2 and \nnewly available technical information.18 In total, under subprogram 2, five indicative policy actions \nhave been specified with additional technical detail, two indicative policy actions to strengthen the \nlegal framework for PPPs under the first reform area have been combined into one while achieving \nthe targeted outcome, and two indicative policy actions that targeted the introduction of a third \nparty logistics model by Post PNG and the redevelopment of Jacksons International Airport under \na PPP model under the third reform area have been removed based on technical assessments \nconcluding that the current market climate affected by the COVID-19 pandemic prevented the \nadvancing of reforms and that this was in the best interests of the government and citizens of \nPNG. These two indicative policy actions have been replaced by one new policy action that \nadvances an independent solar power producer arrangement under the third reform area. The \nremaining indicative actions have been implemented as foreseen. The changes are not expected \nto impact the program\u2019s targeted medium-term development results, as shifts in sequencing and \nprioritizing the SOE reform pathway were anticipated as likely during implementation in response \nto changes in the external environment and were therefore factored into the program design. \n \n18.  Reform area 1: Legislative and policy framework strengthened. Actions completed \nunder this reform area provide strong regulatory and policy support to SOE oversight and \noperations,  competition  policy,  and  PPPs.  ADB  has  added  value  by  supporting  all  three \nsubprogram 2 actions in this area through technical assistance (TA).19 The KCH (Amendment) \nBill, approved by the NEC under subprogram 1 for submission to Parliament, was approved by \nParliament in August 2021. The amendments enable KCH to better monitor SOE performance, \nreduce political influence on commercial decision-making, introduce clear processes for the \nselection and ongoing performance appraisal of SOE boards and their directors, strengthen the \ninclusion of women in director appointment processes, and clarify identification and costing of \nCSOs. The amendments also reinforce SOE corporate governance requirements, including the \ntimely preparation and publication of corporate plans and audited financial statements. \n \n19.  Following  the  approval  of  the  National  Competition  Policy  under  subprogram  1, \nsubprogram 2 supported the policy\u2019s implementation. A plan was developed that outlines the \npolicy\u2019s operationalization and monitoring by various public sector agencies. The Ministry of State \nEnterprises and the Department of Treasury (DOT) negotiated general competitive neutrality \nprinciples  that  are  in  line  with  international  guidelines  and  global  goals  for  sustainable \n \n18 Further detail of changes is in Summary of Changes from Indicative Actions (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n19 ADB. 2019.

Subprogram 3 will continue the \nstrengthening  of  competition  and  consumer  protection  by  supporting  NEC  approval  of \namendments to the Independent Consumer and Competition Commission Act 2002 that will \nsupport the reporting of general competitive neutrality principles, the process for investigating \nissues raised, and the mandate to provide advice on and monitoring of the participation of \nwomen\u2019s businesses in public procurement. Additionally, under subprogram 2, amendments to \nthe PPP Act were approved by the NEC for submission to Parliament in September 2021. The \namendments include the establishment of the PPP Centre and recruitment of the chief executive \nofficer for the PPP Centre. The indicative policy action for subprogram 2 had provided for these \nactions to be endorsed by the PPP Steering Group, however, this is no longer required as they \nhave been included in the legislative amendments. Hence, the two indicative actions concerning \namendments to the PPP Act and PPP Steering Group have been combined into one prior action. \nSubprogram 3 will support implementation of PPP regulations to make the amended PPP Act fully \noperational. The PPP Steering Group will approve guidelines on roles and responsibilities for the \nnew PPP Centre and utilize budget allocations for its operations starting from 2022\u20122024. \n \n20.  Reform area 2: Governance and transparency enhanced. The second reform area \nsupports the implementation of the amendments to the KCH Act through close monitoring of \ncompliance by KCH and individual SOEs. ADB has added value to all actions under this reform \narea through staff advisory support and TA (footnote 19). Under subprogram 1, the KCH board \napproved new processes and guidelines for the appointment and assessment of all directors. As \npart of subprogram 2, the KCH board implemented these new process and guidelines. This led \nto an increase in female representation to 10% of all SOE directors in 2021 from 4% in 2019. The \nestablishment and operationalization of a database of qualified women for potential director \npositions under subprogram 2 supports further increases in female board participation under \nsubprogram 3. The database includes the names of women who are qualified for future board \npositions and identifies those requiring further training or experience. The ongoing tracking of the \nprogress of these women and actively alerting them to upcoming positions to apply for provides \na strong pipeline of women for the future. A KCH employee has been identified and is undergoing \ntraining to monitor and continue developing the database. Further, the KCH board approved new \nprocesses and guidelines for assessing SOE directors\u2019 performance against key performance \nindicators, with implementation support provided through subprogram 3. \n \n21.  To strengthen compliance and provide the information for effective oversight, subprogram \n2 continued the phased approach started under subprogram 1 to eliminate the backlog of audited \nfinancial  statements  for  KCH  and  SOEs  in  the  GBT.  Despite  ongoing  COVID-19-related \nrestrictions that hindered workflows, the progress of completed audited financial statements has \nbeen commendable. To date, the auditor general has signed off the audited accounts of all nine \nSOEs for 2018 and eight SOEs for 2019 and four for 2020 (as required under policy action 2.6).21 \nThe Auditor General\u2019s Office has also appointed auditors for all nine SOEs for 2020 and for five \nSOEs for 2021, and all completed audited financial statements have been published on the KCH \nwebsite. This provides the basis for bringing all SOE audited financial statements up to date under \nsubprogram 3. The KCH board approved the 2021 corporate plans and statements of corporate \nintent for seven of the nine SOEs, including reporting on gender diversity as per guidelines \n \n20 The general competitive neutrality principles require SOEs to (i) achieve a commercial rate of return on assets;  \n(ii) be tax neutral, i.e., pay all taxes and duties; (iii) be regulation neutral, i.e., comply with all laws and regulations; \nand (iv) be debt neutral, i.e., borrow at commercial rates or include charges to account for implicit and explicit \ngovernment guarantees. \n21 Audited accounts are due for each SOE by 30 June each year. \n \n ", "8 \napproved  under  subprogram  1.  Subprogram  3  will  continue  supporting  the  preparation  of \ncorporate documentation for 2022 and expand coverage across the SOE portfolio. \n \n22.  Following the approval of a procurement policy for PPL under subprogram 1, the PPL \nboard approved a revised procurement framework as part of subprogram 2, enhancing clarity and \nefficiency. This is an important step towards improving PPL\u2019s ability to manage  its capital \nexpenditure and cash flow. The provisions provide guidance on supporting women\u2019s businesses \nto better participate in procurement processes. Subprogram 3 will support the implementation of \nthe new framework. Demonstrating the implementation of CSO provisions under the KCH Act, \nPost PNG piloted estimating the cost of its CSOs under subprogram 2 and reported this in its \n2021 corporate plan. Accurately identifying and capturing this information gives greater planning \ncapability to the SOE and allows the budgeting information to be shared with KCH and Treasury. \nSubprogram 3 will expand the CSO costing to at least five SOEs, with funding for at least one \nSOE included in the 2022 national budget. Lastly, the KCH board continued to improve the quality \nand public disclosure of its KCH annual reviews started under subprogram 1 by disclosing the \n2019 and 2020 annual reviews on its website. The expanded reporting gave coverage to key \nprojects, the investment outlook for all SOEs in the GBT, financial accounts, and gender diversity \nindicator performance. Subprogram 3 will continue disclosure of the 2021 annual review and add \nsummary statements of corporate intent and audited financial information to the 2020 report \ncontent. \n \n23.  Reform  area  3:  Financial  sustainability  of  specific  state-owned  enterprises \nimproved. Subprogram 2 supported ANL, Water PNG, and PPL to strengthen their operations \nfor improved financial sustainability. ANL progressed the implementation of its recovery plan \nthrough a variety of strategic initiatives, including closing international sales offices and hiring \naircraft complete with operational staff (wet leases) as a more financially efficient means of \nrunning freight. It has also actively worked on reducing and consolidating creditors. Domestically, \nANL is working with the Internal Revenue Commission on a swap for tax owed and, after \ncommissioning an independent legal audit of all historic debt, has been able to progress payments \nto major creditors. It has also renegotiated an airplane engine service agreement to deliver \nimmediate savings in 2021. Finally, ANL has divested noncore assets by selling nine properties, \neasing  COVID-19  related  cash  flow  challenges.  Subprogram  3  will  continue  recovery  plan \nimplementation, including through adopting a financial decision-making tool, further rationalizing \noverseas sales offices, improving the fleet utilization system, and continuing noncore asset \ndivestment. \n \n24.  In the water sector, subprogram 2 supported parliamentary approval of the National Water \nSupply and Sanitation (Amendment) Bill 2019 initiated under subprogram 1. This will facilitate the \nmerger of Eda Ranu into Water PNG, which will become operational under subprogram 3, with \nthe aim of realizing efficiencies and streamlining operations. Further, in September 2021 the \nWater PNG board approved the Port Moresby Water Supply System Master Plan (2020\u20122040), \nwhich includes a social and gender analysis, and initiated a feasibility study to structure a PPP \nfor a new Mount Eriama water treatment plant that will explore the inclusion of landowner benefits \nand meet the forecast water needs of Port Moresby through to 2030.22 Subprogram 3 will seek \nNEC approval to undertake the recommended PPP structuring arrangement based on the \nfeasibility study. Work with PPL has continued from subprogram 1 with the approval by the board \nof the revised procurement framework in subprogram 2. Implementation is ongoing and scheduled \nfor completion in 2021, giving PPL enhanced cash flow management, forecasting, and budgeting \n \n22 Hunter H2O and Water PNG. 2021.

ADB has added value through TA on private sector participation for both Water PNG \nand PPL (footnote 19). \n \n25.  Subprogram 1 began the process of strengthening the environment for fostering and \npromoting PPP transactions and privatization opportunities in PNG. Subprogram 2 indicative \nactions were based on the best available information on potential projects at the time and a large \nnumber of work streams were carried out in these areas, with the understanding that not all \nprojects will come to fruition while others may come to the fore. Following the NEC decision for \nPost PNG to create a third-party logistics company with a reputable strategic partner under \nsubprogram 1, the detailed feasibility study concluded that none of the identified potential partners \nhad the financial, managerial, or technical capabilities to be a suitable joint venture partner. A \nreview was subsequently commissioned, and it recommended a more detailed assessment of the \nviability of the legacy postal and related services business, which will further investigate suitable \noptions including through a partnership model. The indicative policy action was removed from the \npolicy matrix based on these technical findings. ADB will follow the progress of this assessment \nand, if a viable option is presented, will look to support it. Similarly, the implementation of the \ndecision taken under subprogram 1 to redevelop Jacksons International Airport under a PPP was \npaused because of the COVID-19 pandemic and following sound technical advice from ADB\u2019s \nOffice of Public\u2013Private Partnership. Related indicative actions in subprograms 2 and 3 were \nremoved and replaced by a subprogram 2 action for the PPL board to approve the release of a \ncall for expressions of interest as part of a competitive tender for the proposed Gazelle Solar \nIndependent Power Producer Project based on a PPP prefeasibility assessment, which will be \nfurther progressed through subprogram 3. \n \n26.  Lastly, after subprogram 1 supported the settlement of government arrears owed to ANL, \nsubprogram 2 continued reforms through an NEC decision to settle the buildup of arrears to all \nSOEs. Detailed discussions between the DOT, KCH, and PPL have resulted in the DOT being \ncurrent on its payments to PPL by the end of September 2021 based on payment of undisputed \ninvoices within 60 days. Subprogram 3 will support further arrears payments, ensuring both the \ngovernment and SOEs meet their obligations. \n \n27.  ADB value addition. ADB has a history of involvement in SOE reforms in PNG through \nTA, which have supported the design and implementation of the government-owned SOE reform \nprogram (paras. 18, 20 and 24; footnote 19).23 ADB regional TA has supported benchmarking of \nSOE performance since 2012,24 and feasibility assessments for PPPs for the National Airports \nCorporation, PPL, PNG Ports Corporation, and Eda Ranu.25 Results have been mixed, depending \non political commitment and administrative support. ADB has built strong relationships with SOEs \n \n23 TA in the areas of SOEs, PPPs, and business environment reform has been provided by ADB through country-\nspecific TA and the regional Private Sector Development Initiative (footnote 19), including its previous phases.

While \nearlier reform progress was slow, the current administration\u2019s commitment to SOE reforms at the \nhighest level and ADB\u2019s support through a medium-term program to advance SOE reforms in \nPNG provide, for the first time, a more enabling environment. \n \n28.  Development  partner  coordination.  ADB  has  coordinated  with  key  development \npartners on the program. Regional TA (footnote 19) is cofinanced by the governments of Australia \nand New Zealand, and the European Union. Ongoing and planned partner TA projects, including \nfrom the governments of Australia and New Zealand and the World Bank, were considered in \nidentifying and implementing reforms.27 ADB coordinated closely with the IMF during program \nformulation, including on policy dialogue, fiscal projections, and macroeconomic analysis. This is \nalso reflected in the IMF\u2019s SMP, currently under discussion to be extended into a second phase \nuntil June 2022, which supports transparency, accountability, and governance in SOEs. New \nZealand is providing parallel cofinancing of $1 million as grants, not administered by ADB. The \ngovernment leads the coordination of development partners on SOE reform. \n \n29.  Lessons. The key lesson from the mixed success of ADB\u2019s prior engagement in SOE \nreform in PNG is that capitalizing on political support for reform is crucial.28 ADB seeks to make \nthe most of the current administration\u2019s commitment to reform and  chose a programmatic \napproach that gradually builds in complexity and strength to ensure, and indeed build, ongoing \ncommitment. Where feasible, legislation, implementation support, and capacity building will help \ninstitutionalize  reforms.  ADB  recognizes  that  extensive  TA,  coordinated  with  development \npartners and provided in parallel with budget support, can help advance the reform agenda and \nsupplement government capacity. The program recognizes that stronger oversight mechanisms \nand  resolution  of  board  issues  can  improve  SOE  performance.29 Other  lessons  include \nrecognizing the benefits of (i) backloading ADB\u2019s disbursements across three subprograms and \nrecognizing that implementation of complex reforms may take longer, based on ADB\u2019s experience \nin Fiji;30 (ii) establishing a technical working group to coordinate reforms, including staff from the \nMinistry of State Enterprises, the DOT, the Department National Planning and Monitoring, and \nKCH and relevant SOEs, based on ADB\u2019s experience in the health sector program in PNG;31 and \n(iii) given the vested interests involved in SOEs, ensuring relevant ministers are kept abreast of \nprogress and difficulties encountered so their support can be used to overcome challenges. To \nensure sustainability of reforms, a post-program partnership framework will be developed during \nthe preparation of subprogram 3 to provide guidance on the continued provision of TA and as a \nbasis for ongoing dialogue and engagement. \n \n \n26 ADB.

Manila. \n \n ", "11 \nC.  Expected Outcome of the Reforms \n \n30.  The program is aligned with the overarching development objective of delivering services \nacross PNG at high quality and affordable prices (footnote 14). The targeted outcome of the \nreforms is to improve the performance of SOEs. SOEs are responsible for the delivery of several \nessential services in PNG, including water and sanitation, electricity, communications, and air and \nsea transport. Poor SOE performance undermines investments in service infrastructure and the \nefficient delivery of public services while causing a significant drain on scarce government \nresources, which are then unavailable for other priorities. Improving SOE performance therefore \ncomes with the double dividend of better, more efficient SOE service delivery, and the freeing of \nfiscal resources that can be redirected to other priority sectors like health and education. \n \n31.  A better policy, legal, and institutional framework for SOEs supported through the program \nand policy actions under subprogram 2 will strengthen governance, diversity, and accountability, \nwhich is expected to improve the operational performance of the SOE portfolio. More transparent \nand  merit-based  selection  and  clearer  performance  evaluation  processes  are  expected  to \ncontribute to more qualified personnel on SOE boards. Some reforms target specific SOEs and \ntackle their constraints. These measures will variously help avoid unsustainable borrowing; \nreduce contingent liabilities; encourage private investment; and improve the reliability, efficiency, \nand affordability of public services. In the medium term, the improved financial position and \noperational performance of SOEs will support greater investment in, and attention to, service \ndelivery.32 \n  \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n32.  Driven by COVID-19 impacts, the government\u2019s development financing needs reached \nalmost $2.0 billion in 2020, financed by $1.0 billion in net external financing on concessional \nterms, $0.8 billion in net domestic financing, and $0.2 billion drawdown of cash reserves. With the \nongoing pandemic, development financing needs are expected to decrease only slightly to K6.6 \nbillion in 2021, equivalent to almost $1.9 billion or 7.1% of GDP. This will be financed from a \ncombination of domestic and external borrowing, including $150 million from subprogram 2 (Table \n2). For 2022, financing needs are projected to fall to below $1.5 billion, with external financing \nexpected to include $250 million from subprogram 3. Complementary to ADB\u2019s financing under \nthe program and financing for investment projects from a range of development partners, external \nbudget financing is being provided on concessional terms from the governments of Australia and \nJapan, the IMF, and the World Bank over the program period during 2020\u20132022. \n \nTable 2: Papua New Guinea\u2019s Financing Needs and Sources \nItem  2018  2019  2020  2021f  2022f \nFiscal balance (% of GDP)  (2.6)  (5.0)  (8.9)  (7.1)  (5.2) \nFiscal balance ($ million)  (624)  (1,220)  (2,082)  (1,848)  (1,450) \nDrawdown from cash balances 0    0    229  0    0   \nNet financing needs ($ million)   624    1,220    1,853    1,848    1,450   \nDomestic net financing ($ million)  (148)  456   821   554   885  \nExternal net financing ($ million)  772   764   1,031   1,293   566  \nof which: ADB PBLs and CPRO ($ million)  100   100   500   150   250 \n( ) = negative, ADB = Asian Development Bank, CPRO = COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option, f = forecast, GDP = \ngross domestic product, PBL = policy-based loan. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Papua New Guinea Department of Treasury estimates. \n \n \n32 Program Economic Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "12 \n33.  The government has requested a regular loan of $150 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the program. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period \nof 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the straight-line method, the \naverage maturity is 9.25 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n34.  The DOT is the executing agency. The DOT, the Ministry of State Enterprises, the Auditor \nGeneral\u2019s Office, and the Department of National Planning and Monitoring are the implementing \nagencies.33 A technical working group, chaired by KCH and including all the implementing \nagencies and representatives from SOEs, is coordinating the program reforms. The program \nimplementation period is October 2019\u2012September 2022, and the implementation period for \nsubprogram 2 is December 2020\u2012October 2021. The proceeds of the policy-based loan will be \nwithdrawn following ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n35.  Safeguards.  Following ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  subprogram  2  is \nclassified category C for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. The \nprior policy actions have been assessed and are not expected to result in or lead to involuntary \nresettlement or negatively affect indigenous peoples or the environment. \n \n36.  Poverty and social. The public sector is an important provider of services to low-income \nhouseholds. The program will help SOEs strengthen public service delivery. Better financial \nsustainability of SOEs will improve their cash flow position and allow them to invest in better \nservices. The program will reduce pressures on the national budget by reducing (i) the need for \ngovernment transfers to cater for inefficient SOE operations and (ii) the risk of SOEs defaulting \non debt that represents a contingent liability for the government. This will help ensure that the \ngovernment has resources to respond to future economic shocks and cushion adverse effects on \nthe poor, while maintaining critical public services. Where feasible, private sector participation will \nincrease competition under a strengthened oversight regime, with positive impacts on affordability \nand quality of services. \n \n37.  Gender. The program is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. Gender inequality \nis prevalent in PNG and there are significant gender gaps in all spheres of life. Women are \nunderrepresented in the formal economy, community leadership, and national politics. Currently, \nthere are no female parliamentarians. Women are underrepresented on SOE boards and in \nmanagement; in 2019 (before the start of the program), only two of 48 SOE directors were women. \nFewer women than men are in the workforce, and men are almost twice as likely as women to \nhave  wage-paying  jobs  in  the  formal  sector.  Women  run  small  enterprises  but  often  face \ncompetitive disadvantages and entry barriers, including limited access to finance and lack of \ninformation  on  accessing  public  procurement  opportunities.  Finally,  while  poor  quality  or \nexpensive service delivery impacts everyone, women disproportionately bear the brunt because \nthey are primary caregivers and are largely responsible for household maintenance and upkeep \n(including coping with water and energy poverty). \n \n \n33 The government transferred the responsibility of managing the PPP Centre and carriage of the PPP Act amendment \nfrom the Department of Finance to the Department of National Planning and Monitoring in November 2020. \n \n ", "13 \n38.  The program includes proactive gender actions and targets in all three reform areas. To \nsupport women\u2019s leadership and active involvement in decision-making, there are significant \nreforms  to  increase  women\u2019s  representation  on  SOE  boards.  These  include  the  KCH  Act \namendment in 2021 introducing a provision to include at least one woman on the short list for \ndirector appointments, and the establishment of a database of women for potential director \npositions to ensure a pipeline of qualified women for SOE boards. These actions support the \nincreased number of female SOE directors over the program period with a target of 10.0% female \nSOE directors in subprogram 2 (up from 4.1% in 2019). As of August 2021, the program has \nsupported the achievement of 10.0% female SOE directors. The performance framework for SOE \ndirectors will now also include measurements on gender and diversity. \n \n39.  In addition to the gender activities at the governance level, SOEs have also approved new \nprocesses to support increased gender equality, including PPL approving revised procurement \nprocesses that include guidance for women\u2019s businesses to better participate in procurement \nopportunities, and reporting on gender diversity in corporate plans, statements of corporate intent, \nand in annual reviews for the first time. Under reform area 3, Water PNG has approved the Port \nMoresby Water Supply System Master Plan that includes gender analysis and a commitment to \ndeveloping a gender action plan. The master plan will guide future PPP processes. \n \n40.  Governance. PNG is classified as a fragile and conflict-affected situation.34 Promoting \ngovernance and strengthening public financial management (PFM) are government priorities \n(footnote 14). A 2015 public expenditure and financial accountability assessment and a 2019\u2013\n2020  reassessment  identified  substantial  gaps  that  undermine  the  composition  of  budget \noutturns, the timeliness of financial reports and subsequent audit oversight, and the compliance \nwith internal controls. In response, the government is implementing several major PFM reform \ninitiatives guided by its PFM reform road map.35 Core reform initiatives are (i) rolling out the \nintegrated financial management system to national and subnational government agencies;  \n(ii) passing and implementing the National Procurement Act 2018 to strengthen controls and help \nboost  value for money,  fairness,  and transparency  in  procurement;36 (iii)  tightening  payroll \ncontrols; and (iv) reforming the national budget to strengthen its use as a policy tool. These \nreforms are supported by ADB and complementary development partner TA, including from the \nGovernment of Australia, the European Union, the IMF, and the World Bank.37 These reforms \nhelp reduce fiduciary risks and ensure that the government can implement its budget. \n \n41.  Complementary to whole-of-government PFM reforms, the program, together with parallel \ndevelopment partner support, will contribute to gradually reducing fiduciary risks stemming from \nthe substantial SOE subsector with its large fiscal drain and liability risks. Program reforms to \nincrease accountability and transparency will directly support the government\u2019s goal of promoting \ngood governance. The current administration has pledged to combat corruption, although much \nremains to be done.38 Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 3 and \ndescribed in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.39 \n \n \n34 ADB.
