The  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  Members  Electricity \nRegulators  Forum  (CMERF)  was  established  in  2005  at  the  request  of  the  countries \nparticipating in CAREC.1 CMERF supports regional cooperation and integration in the energy \nsector under CAREC and aims to develop the capacity of participants to provide improved \nregulation of and regulatory support for energy sector reforms. CMERF promotes more efficient \nproduction and use of energy domestically, and is crucial for supporting the development of \nelectricity trade in the CAREC region. Improved regulation will also attract more private sector \nparticipation in the regions\u2019 energy sector projects.  \n2.  At  the  second  CMERF  Annual  Meeting,  held  in  September  2006,  the  participating \ncountries2 reaffirmed the practical value that CMERF adds to the process of harmonizing \nenergy regulations, encouraging and facilitating regional trade, and developing the capacity of \nboth regulators and regulatory bodies. The countries requested that the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) further support the CMERF program in 2007\u20132008, and advised that CMERF focus \non providing training to participants on specific regulatory topics.  \n \n3.  The technical assistance (TA)3 will be a continuation of ADB\u2019s efforts in support of \nCMERF  and  the  capacity  of  its  participants  to  provide  sound  regulation  of  and  regulatory \nsupport for energy sector developments. It will build on the outcomes of regional TA 62674 \nactivities  and  provide  direct  hands-on  support  for  regulatory  bodies,  by  designing  and \nimplementing tailor-made training programs for regulatory staff. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The priority of the CAREC program in the energy sector is to promote efficient and \nrational energy use within the region. CMERF was established to identify the key challenges \nfaced by governments and regulators and to systematically assist them in moving forward with \nreforms. Energy sector challenges common to CAREC countries include: (i) excessive technical \nand commercial losses; (ii) poor billing and collection; (iii) heavily subsidized tariffs and unsound \ntariff structures; (iv) unreliable services, particularly in rural and poor urban areas; and (v) \naffordability problems facing consumers.5  \n \n5.  The  energy  sector  in  almost  every  CAREC  country  was  until  recently  a  vertically-\nintegrated, publicly-owned monopoly. This arrangement has proven inefficient and imposed \nserious regulatory challenges. CAREC countries are consequently considering a variety of \napproaches to structural reform. Sector reforms in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) are \nevidence  of  gathering  regional  momentum  to  tackle  the  inefficiencies  associated  with  the \nexisting sector structure.  \n \n6.  Institutional weaknesses in most CAREC countries distort the price of domestically-\nproduced energy, so that market prices do not reflect true economic and financial costs, thereby \nobscuring the benefits of energy trade and conservation. Cross-subsidies are also common. \n                                                 \n1  CMERF was established in November 2005 at the Fourth CAREC Ministerial Conference with the support of \nAzerbaijan, PRC, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.  \n2  In addition to the above seven countries, Afghanistan became a participant of CMERF in September 2006. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 23 January 2007.  \n4  ADB. 2005.

Manila. \n ", "2     \nWhile regulators in the region are committed to tariff rationalization, this will require a clear and \nopen debate on the quality of service that the government is willing to support through explicit, \nnon-distortionary subsidies to vulnerable or remote consumers. This debate will require robust \nparticipation by well-informed and articulate regulators, committed to realistically balancing the \nneeds of consumers, developers, and government policies. \n \n7.  CAREC countries also possess significant complementary energy resource endowments. \nKazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Tajikistan,  and  Uzbekistan  possess  the  common  gas  and \nelectricity transmission infrastructure necessary to exploit these complementarities, but the poor \ncondition of the infrastructure remains an impediment to trade. Currently, most energy trade in \nthe region is on an exchange basis, and external power sources are used only when domestic \nproducers  are  constrained.  Deeper  and  more  economically  rational  trade  will  considerably \nreduce the economic cost (including environmental factors) of meeting countries' energy needs. \nThis trade is vital, given the cold winters experienced in all CAREC countries, the high energy \nintensity of most CAREC economies, and the increased industrialization and economic growth \nenvisioned  by  their  governments.  Establishment  of  transparent  electricity  trading  among \nCAREC countries will reduce the perceived political risk associated with investments in large \nprojects that could be implemented for export of energy to neighboring countries. \n \n8.  Recent ADB-financed regional power projects connecting Afghanistan to Tajikistan6 and \nUzbekistan7 are clear examples of how cross-border trade offers a win-win solution, enabling a \nsurplus  of  power  in  one  country  to  satisfy  a  neighbors\u2019  excess  demand.  Recent  studies \nrecommend  that  the  CAREC  region  should  pursue  and  encourage  interconnections  to \nneighboring regions.8 ADB is studying the regional electricity trading potential, which would help \noptimize utilization of power resources in both Central and South Asia.9\n \n9.  Ensuring properly utilization of these opportunities will require further improvements in \nthe  structure  and  regulation  of  individual  countries'  domestic  energy  sectors,  as  well  as \nharmonized  regulations  for  cross-border  energy  trade,  transmission,  and  investment.  The \neconomic returns associated with cross-border infrastructure improvements will depend on the \nresolution of regulatory and structural issues. As reforms improve the sectors\u2019 financial position \nand economic signals, regional trade will emerge as a least-cost solution to meeting energy \ndemand, and returns on infrastructure investments will rise. Regulators will be required to \nfacilitate such trade by harmonizing regulations, particularly regulations regarding the use of \nregional power grids. \n \n10.  At the second CMERF Annual Meeting, participating countries stressed the importance \nof coordination and facilitation of activities and the need for greater ownership of CMERF. The \ncountry delegations reiterated that CMERF was not simply an annual gathering, but an effective \nand functional forum, and that activities under regional TA 6267 provided direct and practical \nsupport to their work. The exchange of ideas during annual meetings was indeed something \nthat the regulators need, and it should be continued, as it fosters active cooperation among \nexperts and regulators, and builds professional relationships between the CAREC region\u2019s \nregulatory bodies.  \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2006.

The participants requested that CMERF train the regulatory agency staff on specific \nenergy regulation topics. In addition to the annual meeting, these training programs will add \ndirect  value  to  the  capacity  of  the  regulatory  bodies  themselves.  The  customized  training \nprograms will also strengthen the individual capacity of the regulatory staff to make professional \njudgments and objective decisions. The participants also debated whether CMERF meetings \ncould  adopt  a  working  group  format,  in  which  specific  case  studies  (i.e.,  regional  power \nregulation  benchmarking  and  wheeling  charge  methodologies)  would  be  presented  and \ndiscussed.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The TA will enable energy regulators to make professional and objective regulatory \ndecisions. Improved regulation will enhance energy trade and support sound energy sector \nreforms in the CAREC region. The key outputs will be strengthened capacity of regulatory \nbodies and improved professional skills and knowledge of regulators. This will be achieved \nthrough customized training programs for regulators on selected focus areas, which enhance \nunderstanding of the economic incentives created by regulatory decisions. The design and \nmonitoring framework is provided in Appendix 1.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The  participating  countries  agreed  that  the  CMERF  program  should  focus  on \nstrengthening the professional capacity of regulatory experts.10 The TA directly responds to this \nneed and will undertake the following hands-on activities: (i) designing and delivering tailored \ntraining programs on specific regulatory topics, and (ii) organization of annual meetings. These \nactivities are consistent with CMERF objectives and will further facilitate close coordination \namong the region\u2019s regulators, ADB, and other multilateral institutions. \n \n14.  Energy regulatory frameworks in each of the CAREC countries differ significantly, and \nregulatory skills vary from one agency to another. These differences in context and skills have \nbeen  evident  during  past  CMERF  meetings  and  activities.  The  participating  countries  fully \nrecognize these differences, and are eager to learn from their neighbors in the region as they \ndevelop approaches that match their own economic and technical conditions and objectives. \nThe issues and responsibilities associated with each approach must be carefully considered by \nregulators, in light of international and regional experience.  \n \n15.  Effective  and  ongoing  interaction  among  CMERF  participants  will  be  required.  The \nannual meeting remains a good platform for exchange of knowledge and experience, and \nfacilitates access to prominent world experts in energy regulation; the meetings also benefit the \nregulators by enabling discussions of successes and failures in addressing common problems. \nElectronic  communications  will  be  an  efficient  and  useful  way  to  develop  initiatives  and \ndisseminate information between annual meetings. \n \n16.  The TA will adopt a flexible approach to the design and delivery of training programs in \norder to effectively target and reach the regulators with relevant issues. Participants have been \nproactive in their willingness to address differences in their mandates and skills. By adopting a \n                                                 \n10 Memorandum of Understanding for the Establishment of CMERF, CAREC Ministerial Conference, Bishkek, Kyrgyz \nRepublic, 6 November 2005. \n ", "4     \nparticipant-driven approach, CMERF will be able to ensure that the participating regulators \nretain ownership of the activities. Initial training programs will focus on the following areas: (i) \nthe roles, functions and skills required for effective energy regulation in the CAREC region; and \n(ii) the costs and benefits of incentive energy regulation in the CAREC region. Each of the \nparticipating  regulators  will  then  nominate  up  to  two  priority  topics  for  consideration  for \nsubsequent  trainings;  two  topics  will  be  defined  following  consultation  among  participating \nregulators. Training activities will then be designed that focus on the specific needs of the target \naudience and are delivered in one of the participating agency locations. \n \n17.  The participating countries also requested that CMERF coordinate efforts with other \nregional energy regulatory associations and training institutions, so as to benefit from existing \nprograms and activities. This will allow CMERF to respond to individual training needs, avoid \nduplication of effort, and save time and resources. Upon receiving specific individual training \nrequests from participating countries the TA will examine the justifications and accordingly \nprovide required support to trainees on a case-by-case basis.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on \na  grant  basis  from  the  Government  of  the  PRC  through  the  PRC  Poverty  Reduction  and \nRegional Cooperation Fund. The detailed cost estimates are shown in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  ADB will be the executing agency, and its Central and West Asia Department (CWRD) \nwill  administer  the  TA.  Each  participating  country\u2019s  regulatory  agency  (the  implementing \nagencies) will take part in (i) defining relevant training topics, (ii) assisting trainers with design \nand preparation, (iii) training delivery, and (iv) organizing annual meetings and leading the \nexchange  of  experience  and  information.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  20  months \nbeginning in April 2007. CWRD will organize and facilitate the annual meetings in 2007 and \n2008. As agreed during the second Annual Meeting in 2006, the Energy Regulatory Authority of \nMongolia will co-host the third CMERF Annual Meeting in Mongolia, when the co-host of the \n2008  annual  meeting  will  be  selected.  An  international  training  institution,  with  qualified \npractical  and  instructional  expertise  in  energy  regulation,  will  be  recruited  to  design  and \nadminister the training programs on selected energy regulation topics. The training institution \nwill be engaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006, \nas amended from time to time) using the quality- and cost-based selection method (simplified \ntechnical proposal). The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. \n \n20.  Training materials will also be disseminated via the CMERF website, and shared directly \nwith  relevant  government  personnel  and  development  partners.  Quality  will  be  assessed \nprimarily  through  participant  and  peer  review.  The  outcome  will  be  observed  through  (i) \ninteractions with regulators during and after training and annual meetings, and (ii) the quality of \nsubsequent regulatory decisions. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Central Asia Regional \nEconomic Cooperation Members Electricity Regulators Forum, and hereby reports this action to \nthe Board.

The  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  Members  Electricity \nRegulators  Forum  (CMERF)  was  established  in  2005  to  support  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration in the energy sector under CAREC. Its main purpose is to develop the capacity of its \nparticipants to provide improved regulation of and regulatory support for energy sector reforms. \nCMERF promotes more efficient production and use of energy domestically, and is crucial for \nsupporting the development of electricity trade in the CAREC region. At the second CMERF \nAnnual Meeting, held in September 2006, the participating countries1 advised CMERF to focus \non providing training to its members on specific regulatory topics. \n2.  This Asian Development Bank (ADB) regional technical assistance directly responds to \nthese  requests  and  will  enable  the  region\u2019s  energy  regulators  to  make  professional  and \nobjective  regulatory  decisions.  It  will  specifically  provide  direct  and  hands-on  support  for \nregulatory bodies through the design and implementation of tailor-made training programs for \nregulatory  staff.  Improved  regulation  will  enhance  energy  trade  and  support  sound  sector \nreforms  in  the  CAREC  region.  Improved  regulation  will  also  attract  more  private  sector \nparticipation in the region\u2019s energy projects. \n3.  Energy regulatory frameworks in each of the CAREC countries differ significantly, and \nregulatory skills vary from one agency to another. These differences in context and skills have \nbeen  evident  during  past  CMERF  meetings  and  activities.  The  participating  countries  fully \nrecognize these differences, and are eager to learn from their neighbors in the region as they \ndevelop approaches suitable for their own economic and technical conditions and objectives. \nThere are issues and responsibilities associated with each approach that must be carefully \nconsidered by regulators, in light of international and regional experience.  \n4.  The TA will adopt a flexible approach to the design and delivery of training programs in \norder to effectively target and reach the regulators with relevant issues. Participants have been \nproactive in their willingness to address differences in their mandates and skills. By adopting a \nparticipant-driven approach, CMERF will be able to ensure that the participating regulators \nretain ownership of the activities. Initial training programs will focus on the following areas: (i) \nthe roles, functions and skills required for effective energy regulation in the CAREC region; and \n(ii) the costs and benefits of incentive energy regulation in the CAREC region. Each of the \nparticipating  regulators  will  then  nominate  up  to  two  priority  topics  for  consideration  for \nsubsequent training. After consultation among participating regulators two topics will be defined. \nTraining programs will then be designed that focus on the specific needs of the target audience \nand are delivered in one of the participating agency locations. \nB.  Inputs  \n5.  An international training institution (the consultant) with qualified analytical, practical and \ninstructional expertise in energy regulation will be recruited to design and administer the training \nprograms.  The  consultant  will  have  sufficient  administrative  and  logistical  experience  in \nproviding training activities for clients from varying countries. The consultant will be engaged in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006, as amended from \n                                                 \n1 CMERF participating countries are Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, the People\u2019s Republic of China, Kazakhstan, the \nKyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. \n ", "8  Appendix 3 \n \ntime to time) using the quality- and cost-based selection method (simplified technical proposal). \nThe consultant will be responsible for the overall planning and implementation of the training \ncomponent of the TA. This responsibility will be carried out under the guidance of the Central \nand West Asia Department of ADB, and in close collaboration with the regulatory agencies of \nCMERF participants. The consultant will ensure and facilitate close coordination among the \nregion\u2019s regulators, ADB, and other multilateral institutions. \n \n6.  The consultant will be responsible for organizing a cohesive team of international and \ndomestic trainers to design and deliver four training programs on select energy regulation topics. \nInitial training will focus on two general topics: (i) the roles, functions, and skills required for \neffective energy regulation in the CAREC region; and (ii) the costs and benefits of incentive \nenergy regulation in the CAREC region. The consultant will also identify the two subsequent \ntraining topics, based on consultation with and input from the regulatory agencies of CMERF \nparticipants. These additional topics will be finalized at the third CMERF Annual Meeting.  \n \n7.  Each training program will be delivered in one of the CMERF country locations. The first \ntwo training programs will be held in conjunction with the third CMERF Annual Meeting, which \nwill  be  held  in  Ulaanbaatar,  Mongolia  and  co-hosted  by  ADB  and  the  Energy  Regulatory \nAuthority of Mongolia. The target date is 10\u201314 September 2007. The location for subsequent \ntraining programs will be selected based on the relevance to the country regulator, as well as \nlogistical and cost considerations. \n8.
