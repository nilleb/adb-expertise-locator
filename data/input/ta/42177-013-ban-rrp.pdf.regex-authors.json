I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Government of Sweden \nthrough Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, both to the People\u2019s Republic \nof Bangladesh, for the Urban Primary Health Care Services Delivery Project.1 This report also \ndescribes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Supporting the Urban Primary Health Care \nServices Delivery Project, and if the Board approves the proposed loan and administration of \nthe grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \n2.  The  project  builds  upon  two  previous  urban  primary  health  care  (PHC)  projects \nsupported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Bangladesh to develop and strengthen \ninstitutional capacity for sustainable delivery of pro-poor primary health services in urban areas \nthrough public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs).2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale  \n3.  Bangladesh is undergoing rapid urbanization. This is largely fuelled by the migration \nfrom rural areas of people in search of employment and trying to escape poverty and frequent \nnatural disasters. A result has been a growing number of impoverished city dwellers. Poor living \nconditions  leave  the  urban  poor,  especially  women  and  children,  more  exposed  to  health \nproblems than the general population, a vulnerability that is compounded by their lack of public \nhealth awareness and access to basic health services. The mortality rate for children under 5 in \nurban slums is 91 per 1,000 live births,3 compared with 77 per 1,000 live births in rural areas.4 \nChildren from the poorest urban wealth quintile are four times more likely to be chronically \nmalnourished than children from the wealthiest urban quintile.5 Among the urban poor, 70% of \nwomen give birth at home with the help only of untrained traditional birth attendants.6 This \nexposes  them to  a  higher risk  of  complications. The  2.46 fertility  rate  among  urban  slum \ndwellers is much higher than the 1.85 in non-slum areas (footnote 3). Many slum women also \nface domestic and workplace violence, which raises the need overall for women to have access \nto urgent medical attention. \n \n4.  Because the poor have a small asset base, sound health is essential for generating their \ndaily  income  and  subsistence.  Poor  health  not  only  limits  their  productivity  and  their \nopportunities to earn and  escape poverty but illness also often deprives them of previous \nincome gains by forcing them to spend on emergency catastrophic health care. These factors \nmake  investment  in  pro-poor  basic  health  services  and  public  health  promotion  critical  to \nreducing urban poverty and protecting the well-being of the overall population in urban areas, \nwhich account for over 60% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product. \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance.

The statutory responsibility for the delivery of PHC in urban areas rests with the urban \nlocal bodies (ULBs), under the oversight of the Local Government Division (LGD) of the Ministry \nof  Local  Government  and  Rural  Development  Cooperatives  (MOLGRDC).  However,  rapid \nunplanned urbanization has overwhelmed the capacity of the ULBs to meet the vast need for \nurban PHC. The private sector is the dominant provider of basic health care in urban areas but \nthese services vary in quality and the poor often cannot afford them. Private health enterprises \ngenerally also do not provide disease preventive and health promotion services, which have low \nprofit margins. These barriers, along with physical, social and other factors result in limited \naccess to and low use of essential health services by the urban poor.  \n \n6.  As a strategy for addressing the large unmet need for urban PHC, the Government of \nBangladesh has long recognized the need to tap nongovernment resources and expertise to \nquickly  expand  coverage  of  services  and  reach  vulnerable  communities.  In  1998,  the \ngovernment initiated a PPP pilot PHC program with support from ADB under the Urban Primary \nHealth Care Project (UPHCP I).7 UPHCP I contracted out government-financed PHC services to \nnonprofit  private  service  providers.  Under  the  contracting  arrangement,  the  private  sector \nassumes a share of financial risks tied to their performance and cost recovery targets, as well \nas certain operational risks in delivering agreed services. ADB\u2019s project completion report on the \nUPHCP I in 20078 found the PPP approach successful, innovative, and replicable, a conclusion \nthat was validated in 2008 by ADB\u2019s Independent Evaluation Department.9 This resulted in a \nsubsequent investment during 2005\u20132012 under the Second Urban Primary Health Care Project \n(UPHCP II), which expanded the area covered.10 Based on the experiences of UPHCP I and \nUPHCP II, the government\u2019s five-year plan for 2011\u20132015 called for continuing the approach \nestablished by ADB\u2019s previous urban PHC projects for delivering basic health services to the \nurban population.11 \n7.  The project builds on the key lessons learned from UPHCP I and UPHCP II and seek to \nfurther  enhance  related  governance  structures  and  health  service  delivery.12 To  improve \ngovernance, the project will strengthen the government\u2019s strategic framework for addressing \nurban health; support relevant institutional arrangements, policies, and guidelines; advocate \nmechanisms  to  mobilize  regular  local  revenue  for  urban  PHC;  and  support  more  direct \ninvolvement and ownership by ULBs in managing delivery of urban health services. To improve \nhealth service delivery, the project will include measures to strengthen quality, accessibility, and \nuse of services so that they have a larger beneficial impact on urban health. These steps will \ninclude the development of a robust quality assurance system, systemized monitoring and \nevaluation (M&E), better identification and targeting of the poor, better physical access for the \npoor, and increased outreach activities. \n \n8.  The project has the following key features: (i) scaling up a pro-poor model of urban PHC \nservices delivery through PPP to cover a wider geographic area; (ii) making substantial use of \nhealth  information  technology  (IT)  to  improve  service  delivery,  training,  and  management;       \n                                                \n7  ADB. 1997.

ADB has addressed rapid urbanization in the country by placing a  high priority on \nempowering local governments, improving urban planning, and making the economic growth \nprocess more inclusive.14 The proposed project conforms with ADB\u2019s holistic, multidisciplinary \napproach  to  urban  sector  development  as  a  core  operation  in  Bangladesh  and  will  help \ntransform the country\u2019s institutions so that they can better deal with rapid urbanization. It will \nreduce  urban  poverty  and  inequality,  address  a  critical  gap  in  urban  basic  services,  and \nenhance the basic human capital and productivity of the urban poor. It aligns with ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 202015 and ADB\u2019s health operational plan16 by building on areas where ADB has a \ncomparative advantage and promoting gender equity and PPP. The project also supports the \ngovernment\u2019s five-year plan commitment to developing strategic partnerships with private sector \nand nongovernment organizations that can provide support in areas that have traditionally been \nin the public sector domain and to promote PPPs as a key element of good governance.17 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The  impact  of  the  project  will  be  the  improved  health  of  the  urban  population  in \nBangladesh, particularly the poor, women, and children. The outcome will be sustainable good \nquality urban PHC services provided in project areas that target the poor and the needs of \nwomen and children. \n \nC.  Outputs  \n11.  The project outcome will be supported through the following outputs: (i) strengthened \ninstitutional  governance  and  local  government  capacity  to  sustainably  deliver  urban  PHC \nservices;  (ii)  improved  accessibility,  quality,  and  utilization  of  urban  PHC  services  delivery \nsystem, with a focus on the poor, women, and children, through PPP; and (iii) effective support \nfor decentralized project management.  \n \n1.  Output  1:  Strengthened  Institutional  Governance  and  Local  Government \nCapacity to Sustainably Deliver Urban Primary Health Care Services \n12.  Support for the Local Government Division.  To assist sustained delivery of urban \nPHC, the project will support strengthening strategic framework for urban health and relevant \ninstitutional set-ups.The project will help the LGD implement the country\u2019s draft national urban \n \nhealth strategy, in coordination with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW).18 The \nstrategy will cover (i) institutional arrangements for urban health in the LGD, (ii) a relevant \npermanent interministerial coordination structure, (iii) clarification of the mandate of the LGD in \nrelation  to  the  MOHFW  for  supporting  the  ULBs  in  carrying  out  their  urban  health \nresponsibilities, and (iv) sustainable financing for urban PHC. The project will also support \ncapacity building of the urban health unit that is being established in the LGD,19 reviewing and \nupdating LGD policies and guidelines to better address crosscutting urban health issues, and \n                                                \n13 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 ADB. 2011.

Support for local governments. The LGD places a very high priority on strengthening \nlocal government institutions and providing them with the assistance necessary for efficient \nprovision of locally relevant public services, including PHC for the poor. The project\u2019s support for \nstrengthening local government institutions will target the ULB health departments, which are \nmainly responsible for delivering urban PHC. Through capacity building, the project will enable \nULB health departments to continue managing the urban PHC systems in their localities after \nthe  project  ends.  This  will  include  developing  reorganization  and  staffing  plans  and \nstrengthening their skills in core project management and in PPP contract management using \nthe UPHCP model. The project outcome will be made more sustainable by enhancing the ULBs\u2019 \nownership of project services and their increased allocation of resources to urban health. Over \nthe project period, participating ULBs will be required to (i) contribute at least 1% of their local \nrevenue to the urban PHC sustainability fund established by the Ministry of Finance,21 and (ii) to \ngradually increase allocations for urban PHC to at least 20% of the development block grants. \nTo support this greater allocation of resources to urban health, the project will finance an \nadvocacy program to sensitize local governments and the local public to urban health issues. \nThe  project  will  help  make  the  use  of  limited  local  public  expenditures  more  efficient  by \ncoordinating with the LGD to train ULBs on integrated planning and budgeting for basic social \nservices, including PHC and public and environmental health. \n \n14.  Management systems and innovations. To support management systems, learning, \nand  innovation  in  urban  PHC,  the  project  will  help  the  government  and  the  implementing \npartners to effectively adapt IT to manage and deliver services efficiently. This will include \nsupport for a computerized health management information system that will ultimately link with \nthe M&E functions of the LGD and the MOHFW; geographic information system mapping of \nexisting  health  facilities  in  the  partnership  agreement  areas  to  improve  referral  links;  and \nincorporation of e-learning and e-assessment in the project training program. The project will \nalso support an operations research program by reputable research institutions that will become \nknowledge hubs on urban health. \n \n2.  Output 2: Improved Accessibility, Quality, and Utilization of Urban Primary \nHealth Care Services Delivery System, with a Focus on the Poor, Women, and \nChildren, through Public\u2212Private Partnership \n15.  Under  this  output,  the  project  will  (i)  support  provision  of  PHC  services,  including \nbehavior  change communication  (BCC),  through  partnership  agreements  with  the  nonprofit \nprivate sector in 30 partnership areas covering all cities and selected municipalities; and (ii) \nstrengthen the urban PHC infrastructure network to improve physical accessibility. \n \n16.  Urban primary health care services. The project will deliver a package of essential \nPHC services aligned with operations of the MOHFW and include comprehensive emergency \nobstetrics care. The package will focus on maternal and child health, nutrition, family planning, \nand BCC. Better access to PHC services and health information will bolster the population\u2019s \nresilience to the health related effects of climate change, given the country\u2019s great vulnerability \n                                                \n20 Central government support for city corporations and municipalities is through block grants and grants-in-aid from \nthe LGD. The grants-in-aid are for specific activities under the development budget; block grants are for general \nbudgetary support. These mechanisms are outside of project financing. \n21 The urban PHC sustainability fund was established 22 September 2008 under UPHCP II with objective to sustain \nPHC services in respective city corporations and municipalities following project completion. \n ", "5 \nto natural calamities and the diseases and injuries that result, particularly among the poor.22 The \nproject will improve the accessibility, quality, and utilization of PHC services. At least 30% of all \nservices, including drugs, will be given free to the poor, with specific emphasis on women. The \nproject will also allocate additional resources to identifying and targeting the urban poor and will \ninclude  weekly  mobile  outreach  services  to  reach  the  extremely  poor  and  the  homeless \npopulation. The project will establish collaboration agreements with local partners to reach more \nof the impoverished in urban areas and to set up effective referral networks.23  It will work to \nimprove the quality of PHC through strong quality assurance mechanisms; support for the \ntraining and qualification of health workers and health managers; a better supply of drugs and \nmedical  equipment;  and  introduction  of  a  small-scale  performance  incentive  scheme  and \ninnovation fund in partnership contracts  to enhance the accountability of partners for their \nresults and to encourage innovations to improve service delivery.  \n \n17.  Infrastructure  network.  The  project  will  improve  access  to  and  coverage  of  PHC \nservices  by  supporting  expansion  of  the  urban  PHC  infrastructure  network,  including  the \nconstruction of 12 comprehensive reproductive health centers and 26 PHC centers near slums \nand other densely populated areas. This new infrastructure will be better designed and more \nfunctional than centers provided under UPHCP I and II. The upgrades will include solar power \nand rainwater harvesting in selected facilities to improve operational efficiency and mitigate \nclimate change impacts. \n \n3.  Output 3:  Effective Support for Decentralized Project Management \n18.  The project will support the government\u2019s sixth five-year plan\u2019s priorities of capacity \ndevelopment in public administration and devolution of responsibilities to local governments by \nprogressively  devolving  the  management  and  implementation  responsibilities  of  its  project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU)  in  the  LGD  to  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  in  the  health \ndepartments of each project city corporation or municipal government. This will strengthen the \noversight and supervisory capabilities of the PMU and the management and implementation \ncapacities of the PIUs and ultimately strengthen the project\u2019s sustainability. The project will give \nthe PMU and PIUs management and technical support in such key areas as PPP contracting, \nurban  PHC,  human  resources  development,  quality  assurance,  procurement,  and  financial \nmanagement. The financial management system employed under UPHCP II will be improved \nand  computerized  under  the  project  to  minimize  fiduciary  risks  and  streamline  project \naccounting processes. The responsibilities of a training coordination cell to be established in the \nPMU will include detailed review and planning of project capacity development requirements, \nstrategic collaboration with other agencies and training institutes, development of guidelines, \nand implementation of the training program. The project will also have a strong performance \nand benefits M&E program that will include support for the health management information \nsystem,  routine  monitoring,  and  rigorous  evaluations  of  project  impacts  and  effectiveness \nthrough household, facility-based, and qualitative surveys. \n \nD.

ADB will finance $50 million (61.72% of the financing), \nthe  Government  of  Sweden  will  provide  the  equivalent  of  $20  million  (24.70%),  and  the \nGovernment of Bangladesh will provide the equivalent of $11 million (13.58%). \n \nTable 2: Financing Plana \nSource  Amount ($ million)    Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank  50.00    61.72 \nGovernment of Swedenb  20.00    24.70 \nGovernment of Bangladesh  11.00    13.58 \n  Total           81.00    100.00 \na  Parallel financing for complementary services will be provided through a $3.0 million grant by the United Nations \nPopulation Fund.  \nb  Administered by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).

Implementation Arrangements \n22.  The LGD of the MOLGRDC will be the executing agency and city corporations and \nmunicipal  governments  will  be  the  implementing  agencies  in  their  project  areas.  A  PMU \nestablished under UPHCP II headed by a full-time project director will be continued in the LGD \nto provide the technical, administrative, and logistical support required for implementation. An \ninterministerial  national  project  steering  committee,  chaired  by  the  secretary  of  LGD  and \nestablished under UPHCP II will oversee overall project implementation. The project will create \n                                                \n24 The ADB loan will also finance transportation and insurance costs. \n25 The United Nations Population Fund will provide support in comprehensive emergency obstetrics care (including \nequipment and ambulances); family planning (including outreach, materials, and BCC); and adolescent sexual \nreproductive health (Project Administration Manual [accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2]).  \n ", "7 \nPIUs in ULB health departments to oversee implementation in project cities and municipalities. \nUrban health coordination committees (UHCCs) will be set up in each project city or municipality to \ncoordinate field activities and stakeholder participation. They will be chaired by ULB chief executive \nofficers. Because cities and municipalities are divided into wards for administrative purposes, ward \nUHCCs cochaired by ward commissioners and zonal health officers will be created and include \nrepresentation from local stakeholders. Where standing committees with similar responsibilities \nalready exist\u2014dealing with health and water and sanitation, for example\u2014the role envisaged for the \nUHCCs may be assigned to these committees so that parallel structures are not set up. \n \n23.  Procurement of civil works, goods, and related services will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Packages  using  national \ncompetitive bidding may follow the government\u2019s Public Procurement Act, 2006 and Public \nProcurement Rules, 2008, with modifications agreed between the government and ADB, as set \nout in the procurement plan. Consulting services will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The \nimplementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the project \nadministration manual (PAM), which includes an indicative procurement plan. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  July 2012\u2013June 2017 \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2017 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  National  Project  Steering  Committee;  Secretary,  LGD  (chair);  representatives  of \nMinistry of Health and Family Welfare, project urban local bodies, Ministry of Finance, \nand Planning Commission (members) \n(ii)  Executing agency  LGD, Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development Cooperatives \n(iii) Key implementing  City Corporations, municipal governments \nagencies \n(iv) Implementation unit  A PMU set up under UPHCP II will be continued within the LGD with 18 proposed \nstaff. \nProcurement   ICB  30 partnership contracts     $36.70 \nNCB  Civil works, vehicles   million \nShopping   Office equipment, furniture  $16.64 million \n$0.32 million \nConsulting services   Firm (QCBS, 90:10)    Monitoring and evaluation   $1.20 million \nFirm (QCBS, 80:20)  Behavior change communication program  $1.50 million  \nFirm (QCBS, 80:20)  Health management information system  $1.15 million \nFirm (CQS)  Operations research  (2 packages)  $0.50 million \nIndividual Consultants  11 person-months, international (2 persons);  $1.17 million \n208 person-months, national (9 persons) \nRetroactive financing  ADB may, subject to its policies and procedures, allow on request advance contracting \nand/or advance  of procurement and consulting services, and may finance up to 20% of the loan and \ncontracting  the grant amount for eligible expenditures for operational costs incurred in the 12-\nmonth  period  before  signing  of  the  loan  agreement.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n24.  A TA of $400,000 is proposed to be attached to the project on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The TA will be implemented over 18 months and \n ", "8 \nprovide capacity building and implementation support to minimize delays in project start-up.26 \nThe LGD will be the executing agency for the TA and it will implement the TA through the PMU. \nADB will engage the consultants on an individual basis in accordance with its Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n25.  Economic viability.  The project\u2019s economic viability has been assessed based on the \nassociated benefits and costs. The economic benefits include (i) the direct benefit for project \nbeneficiaries in health care cost savings; and (ii) productivity gains in terms of disability adjusted \nlife years saved, and such other expected benefits as fewer work days lost due to illness, \npositive externalities of immunization, and health improvements that will lead to better learning \noutcomes in school. Three major streams of economic costs are (i) the investment costs, which \ninclude the costs of constructing and upgrading PHC facilities, of purchasing equipment, of \ninstalling IT-based systems, and of providing training; (ii) indirect project-related costs, including \nthose  of  maintaining,  replacing,  and  upgrading  capital  investment,  such  as  the  costs  of \nmaintaining PHC facilities; and (iii) the operating costs of administration, wages, transport, and \nutilities. The project\u2019s estimated net present value is $17.5 million. The estimated economic \ninternal rate of return is 27.8%, assuming a discount rate of 12%. A sensitivity analysis shows \nthat the project will yield economic internal rates of return of over 12% even with significant \nadverse changes to key assumptions. This suggests that the project is a sound investment. \n \n26.  Financial  sustainability.  Financial affordability and sustainability of the  project has \nbeen analyzed based on the country\u2019s medium-term budgetary framework and current five-year \nplan. The government\u2019s annual commitment to the project as a percentage of total government \nexpenditure  averages  0.08%  over  the  five-year  period.  The  long-term  sustainability  of  the \nproject will depend on several key factors: (i) cost recovery; (ii) the ability of the LGD to cover \nestimated investments and associated recurrent expenditures for urban health; (iii) gradual \nincreases by ULBs in their allocation for urban PHC and other pro-poor basic services to at least \n20% of the development block grants (footnote 20); and (iv) delivery of at least 1% contribution \nby each participating ULB of their annual revenue budget to the urban PHC sustainability fund \n(footnote 21). Given a positive outlook for growth in gross domestic product and government \ninvestment, allocations for local government development are expected to increase and urban \nhealth programming will likely receive more resources than it does now. The cost of continuing \nthe program for one year after the project ends in 2017 have been projected at Tk0.92 billion, or \n0.05% of total government expenditure. The government is projected to be fiscally able to \nprovide this level of funding. \nB.  Governance \n27.  Project-related governance risks have been assessed, as required by ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor Implementing the Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan II. 27  The assessment found \nthat adequate management system and staff capacity were established in the PMU under \nUPHCP II and will be retained. Because this project will have greater geographic coverage and \naims to develop sustainable capacity in ULBs for delivering basic health services, the risk \nassessment and management plan makes several recommendations to strengthen capacity \nboth  in  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  and  to  improve  procedures  for  efficient \n                                                \n26 Details of the TA are in Technical Assistance for Supporting the Urban Primary Health Care Services Delivery \nProject (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 ADB. 2008. Guidelines for Implementing the Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan II. Manila. \n ", "9 \nmanagement  and  effective  control  in  financial  management  and  procurement. 28  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment and the LGD. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are \ndescribed in the PAM and key ones are reflected in the loan covenants. \nC.  Poverty and Social \n28.  The project will improve the lives and productivity of the urban poor by providing them \nwith affordable access to basic health services. It will expand the reach of basic health services \nthrough pro-poor project interventions. These will include strong outreach activities to ensure \ncommunity participation in all stages of project implementation and evaluation, social and BCC \nactivities  targeting  the most  vulnerable  populations, strengthened  poverty  identification  and \ntargeting, and the management of a fee-exemption system.  By focusing on women\u2019s health, the \nproject will enhance gender equity. A gender action plan has been prepared to promote gender \nequity in the project areas by such measures as (i) reducing inequalities in sex-disaggregated \nhealth indicators, and (ii) gender training and institutional support while developing personnel \ncapacity in gender mainstreaming and monitoring project outputs. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n29.  Environment. This is a category B project. The project will support construction of new \nhealthcare  centers  and  the  improvement  of  existing  facilities.  It  is  not  expected  to  have \nsignificant or irreversible negative environmental impacts during either construction or operation. \nAny environmental risks will be effectively addressed through proper mitigation measures at the \ndesign, planning, construction, and operation phases. An environment assessment and review \nframework has been prepared and disclosed because land and sites for project civil works will \nbe identified only after implementation begins. The executing agency has ample institutional \ncapacity to carry out environmental safeguards and compliance measures, along with capacity \nto  manage  related  risks  and  implementation  of  the  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework. \n \n30.  Social  safeguards.  This  is  a  category  C  project  for  involuntary  resettlement  and \nindigenous peoples. No land acquisition will be involved because existing unoccupied land \nalready owned by the ULBs will be used for project\u2019s civil works. The project will use institutional \narrangements and assurance mechanisms to ensure compliance with safeguard requirements \nin new construction. A resettlement framework for conducting social screening, assessment, \nand stakeholder consultations is included in the PAM. Since this project covers only urban areas, \nno impact on indigenous peoples is expected. \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n31.
