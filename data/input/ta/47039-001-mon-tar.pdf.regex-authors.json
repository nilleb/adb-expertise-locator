The Municipality of Ulaanbaatar (MUB) requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide  a  technical  assistance  (TA)  that  will  enhance  its  in-house  resources,  capacity,  and \ninstitutional arrangements related to urban planning for better delivery of master and local plans \nand  efficient  plan  implementation. 1  After  the  TA  fact-finding  mission  on  28  November\u2013\n12 December  2012,  the  Mayor  of  Ulaanbaatar  and  the  Director  General  of  the  Economic \nCooperation, Loan and Assistance Policy Department at the Ministry of Economic Development \nsigned a memorandum of understanding. The mission consulted the Master Planning Agency of \nCapital City (MPACC) of MUB and the Urban Planning, Architecture and Design Institute of \nUlaanbaatar  City  (UPADI).2 Both  entities  agreed  on  the  TA\u2019s  impact,  outcome,  outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, cost and financing, and outline terms of reference for consulting \nservices. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Rapid urbanization is taking place in Ulaanbaatar, but strategic urban infrastructure and \nplanning are inadequate. MUB needs to build its capacity to plan, regulate, and implement its \nurban development to overcome long-term economic, social, and environmental problems; and to \nimprove  the  people\u2019s  quality  of  life.  Parliamentary  approval  of  the  Ulaanbaatar  Urban \nDevelopment Master Plan 2030 in February 2013 and adoption of new laws to regulate the urban \ndevelopment of Ulaanbaatar provided a framework for the city\u2019s development. However, the \nexisting technical capacity and institutional arrangements for urban planning in the MUB make it \ndifficult to implement the master plan effectively, and are inadequate for the urban development \nrequirements of the rapidly growing city. \n \n3.  Institutional arrangements. The main government bodies involved in urban planning are \nas follows: \n(i)  The  Ministry  of  Construction  and  Urban  Development  is  responsible  for \n(a) preparing the legal framework for urban planning, including laws on urban \ndevelopment,  land  management,  and  construction;  and  (b)  reviewing  and \napproving the urban plans of Ulaanbaatar before submission to the Parliament. \n(ii)  The  MPACC  of  MUB  is  responsible  for  (a)  formulating  policies  on  urban \ndevelopment, land administration, and infrastructure; (b) preparing master plans \nand detailed development plans; (c) developing the urban planning database; and \n(d) monitoring development and construction activities. The agency has a division \nthat manages the geographic information system (GIS) and urban database.  \n(iii)  UPADI is an agency under the MPACC and is responsible for formulating the city\u2019s \nmaster  plan,  associated  detailed  plans,  and  building  and  infrastructure  design \naccording to the economic and social objectives of the city.  \n(iv)  Several other municipal agencies such as Agency for Economic Development are \nalso involved in the planning process and implementation. Sector agencies are \nresponsible for  developing  their  own  sector master  plans,  such  as  water  and \nwastewater master plan, transport master plan, and energy master plan. \n \n4.  Currently, implementation and enforcement of urban master and local plans are ineffective \ndue to (i) segmentation of urban planning functions in MUB; (ii) lack of integrated protocols, \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 5 April 2013. \n2  Previously, the name of the Master Planning Agency of Capital City was the Construction, Urban Development, and \nPlanning Department. \n ", "2   \napproval mechanisms, and information sharing among the main players directly involved in urban \nplan  formulation  and  implementation;  and  (iii)  weak  links  among  urban  planning,  land \nmanagement processes, and legal framework. \n \n5.  Urban planning principles. Although the system of urban development planning has \nundergone  changes  since  the  early  1990s,  current  planning  procedures,  regulations,  and \nstandards still largely reflect the central \u2015top-down\u2016 planning approach. In particular, the process \nis still heavily oriented towards the use of prescriptive end-state master plans. Urban planning \nneeds  to  adopt  modern,  integrated,  multisector  approaches;  and  to  shift  away  from  the \nconstruction-based plans of the past. In particular, it should include plans that are more flexible in \nresponding to the market-led economy, and accord greater role to communities in determining the \nfuture of their urban areas through participatory consultations on plans.  \n \n6.  Urban planning capacity. Changes in the planning system will need significant technical \nsupport to train a new generation of urban planners, widespread dissemination of information, \nand training in new ways of urban planning. To date, the majority of the city\u2019s professionals \nworking in planning are architects rather than urban planners. They come from a design-based \nbackground that perpetuates the detailed construction-based master plan approach rather than \nmodern,  broad-based  planning,  which  embraces  economic,  social,  and  environmental \nconsiderations. Introduction and enforcement of new policies, plans, and laws will be dependent \non availability of sufficient municipal capacity. Without proper capacity and adequate professional \nskills of the city staff, the city master plan along with the associated detailed plans cannot be \nproduced and implemented with desired quality standards. \n \n7.  Planning  software.  Updated  management  and  design  software\u2014in  particular,  a \ncomprehensive GIS\u2014are fundamental tools for making decisions in planning in a complex urban \nsystem such as Ulaanbaatar. A GIS database is already being assembled by  the MPACC. \nHowever, it is being used primarily for data storage and mapping, rather than as an analytical tool \nor for assisting in information sharing and decision-making. \n \n8.  The city master plan. Parliament approved the Ulaanbaatar Urban Development Master \nPlan 2030 in February 2013. One of the master plan\u2019s key aspects is that, for the first time, the \nredevelopment  of  the  poor  and  highly  polluted  peri-urban  ger  areas  is  formally  and  fully \nincorporated  in  the  city\u2019s  overall  development  and  urban  infrastructure  programming.3 The \nextension  of  urban  services  through  a  network  of  subcenters  will  unlock  the  economic \ndevelopment potential and improve the livelihood of people in these poor urban areas. The \nimplementation of the master plan is essential to alleviate poverty and improve the environment in \nthe city. However, the master plan is still preliminary and provides only general development \ndirections. Further refinement and adjustment is expected to start soon in detailed local plans \nbased on the approved master plan. Also, a large number of sector-based projects are being \nplanned  or  implemented  within  the  city  by  development  partners.  It  is  critical  that  each \ndevelopment partner\u2019s assistance plan aligns with the master plan and government programs. \nThe master plan and its associated detailed plans need to recognize and incorporate the ongoing \nproject  activities,  as  the  master  plan  will  have  the  legal  authority  in  guiding  overall  urban \ndevelopment. It is critical for the city to have the capacity to develop plans that build on ongoing \nurban  projects  supported  by  development  partners  and  serve  as  a  tool  to  coordinate  their \nassistance. Close coordination with relevant ministries, departments, and development partners \nwill also be required. \n                                                \n3 Ger areas are named after ger tents. \n ", "  3 \n \n9.  Legal and regulatory framework. Several changes are being proposed to current urban \nlaws, and the Ministry of Construction and Urban Development is receiving assistance from \ndevelopment partners such as ADB, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and World \nBank. The proposed urban laws will create a significantly better planning and legal environment \nfor upgrading city development. However, an important condition for this is the harmonization of \nthe proposed urban laws with other laws related to urban planning and development, along with \nthe capacity to enforce them through adequate regulations. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the TA will be improved living conditions in Ulaanbaatar. The outcome will \nbe stronger capacity of MUB for urban planning.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The objective of the TA will be to strengthen Ulaanbaatar\u2019s development strategies and \nplans by building MUB\u2019s capacity and mechanisms in urban planning based on international \nstandards. Assistance will involve provision of training materials, working group, and workshops \nfocused on disseminating methodologies for and experiences in strategic planning processes. \nImprovement of master and local planning capacity will specifically emphasize (i) strengthening \nthe critical links between (a) the urban infrastructure sectors\u2014e.g., water, transport, and energy\u2014\nin integrated urban planning and development processes; and (b) economic development and \nphysical  and  infrastructure  planning,  urban  laws  and  policies,  poverty  reduction,  and \nenvironmental improvement; (ii) financing requirements of investment plans, revenue generation \nfrom different urban infrastructure services, and implications for local government debt, budget, \nand  other  key  financing  indicators;  (iii)  full  engagement  of  government  and  nongovernment \nstakeholders,  private  sector,  and  communities  in  the  planning  process  through  participatory \nplanning methods; and (iv) enhancement of environmental and safeguard skills and mechanisms \nto lay the foundation for green development as well as strategic environmental assessment with \nmeasurable indicators. The TA will have four components with the following outputs. \n \n12.  Output 1: Enhancement of technical skills for urban planning and development of \nmaster  and local  plans. This will mainly target the MPACC and UPADI staff but could be \nextended to other related institutions in the MUB.4 The TA will (i) analyze urban planning capacity \nand assess training needs; (ii) extend advisory services from a team of international and national \nconsultants who will strengthen the current MUB urban planning teams at different levels of the \nplanning process; (iii) provide training and materials on urban planning to introduce (a) modern, \nintegrated, multisector, and sustainable urban planning practices and participatory approaches; \n(b) updated norms and standards for urban land use planning, urban design, green development, \nand  construction;  and  (c) international  best  practices,  lessons,  and  case  studies  from  other \noverseas  cities,  particularly  post-communist  cities  and  cities  with  similar  climate  settings  as \nUlaanbaatar;  (iv)  provide  training  by  inviting  external  speakers  to  increase  the  international \nexposure of municipal staff; (v) undertake case studies and workshops on concrete and agreed \nurban development plan scenarios or sector plans; (vi) launch a pilot planning program to apply \nthe learned technical capacities and skills to the practical plan-making process; (vii) train trainers \nto ensure the sustainability of the technical skills enhancement; and (viii) produce knowledge \n                                                \n4 This includes the newly established Agency of Economic Development of MUB. \n ", "4   \nproducts on strategic urban development and lessons learned from capacity building activities. \nMPACC and UPADI staff will receive certificates upon completion of the training programs. \n \n13.  Output  2:  Strengthening  of  urban  planning  function  with  a  more  participatory \nprocess  and  efficient  organizational  arrangement.  The  TA  will  (i)  perform  an  in-depth \nassessment of the current institutional arrangements and decision-making mechanisms within \nurban planning and conduct case studies; (ii) develop with the key stakeholders a road map for \norganizational  restructuring  within  MUB,  and  produce  an  agreed  time-bound  organizational \ndevelopment plan; (iii) introduce the participatory planning approach, build it into the decision-\nmaking process, and establish an action plan on a participatory, bottom-up approach; (iv) define \nand agree with key stakeholders a road map for master plan implementation and a step-by-step \napproach of establishing mechanisms to plan, manage, and promptly update master and local \nplans, policies, and standards in response to the changing demands of the growing city; (v) \nrecommend links between urban planning, regulatory, and legal frameworks; and (vi) prepare an \noperations manual for departmental responsibilities with staff job descriptions and management \nprocesses. \n \n14.  Output  3:  Establishment  of  shared  urban  database. A properly functioning urban \nplanning database will be established, with proper hardware and software and trained staff for \ndatabase operation and maintenance. The TA will (i) propose specific solutions and protocols to \nensure that planning activities by the municipality are prepared using the same base maps, with \nstandardized coordinates and data sources; (ii) provide institutional and technical advice to install \na GIS and a geospatial center within municipal departments and agencies to ensure that the \nitems  mentioned  above  are  developed  and  implemented  in  a  coordinated  manner;  and \n(iii) propose  a  step-by-step  harmonization  of  all  the  geospatial  tools  now  used  by  different \nagencies (e.g., Ulaanbaatar water and sewerage company, transport planning agencies) in a \nstandardized and integrated system and platform. The shared urban database could be provided \nby establishing a one-stop shop containing all planning information of Ulaanbaatar, including \nmaps,  data,  laws,  and  reports.  A  board  of  directors  that  will  include  representatives  from \nmunicipal departments and agencies will manage the database. \n \n15.  Output 4: Upgrade of planning software. Geospatial systems will be established and \nused with proper software and trained staff for operation and maintenance. Up-to-date GIS, \ngeospatial tools, as well as management and design software and their official licenses will be \ndeveloped or purchased to support the daily planning activities and the shared urban database. \nWhen conducting technical analysis and feasibility work, where necessary, specialized software \nwill be purchased and training will be provided. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,700,000, of which $1,500,000 which will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR)  administered  by  ADB.  The \ngovernment  will  provide  in-kind  counterpart  support  through  the  provision  of  office  space, \nequipment, office communications, and remuneration and per diem of counterpart staff. The cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  MUB will be the executing and implementing agency for the TA. It is proposed that the TA \nbe implemented through the MPACC, one of MUB\u2019s departments in charge of planning. The \ncapacity development activities  will mainly target the MPACC and the UPADI, which is the \nagency under MPACC, but if found necessary, the activities will be extended to other relevant \n ", "  5 \nagencies in MUB to promote integration. A TA project management unit will be established within \nthe MPACC and will report to the management of MUB. MUB will form a steering committee to \nprovide overall guidance, monitoring, and evaluation on implementation of the TA. The steering \ncommittee is proposed to include key government departments and agencies, stakeholders, and \nkey development partners to ensure that assistance in urban planning is coordinated, updated \ninformation is shared, and synergy between key players and development partners is maximized. \nThe TA will be closely coordinated with ADB\u2019s proposed urban development program and JICA\u2019s \ncapacity development project.5 \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, and is expected to start on 1 October 2013 \nand finish by 30 September 2015. The TA will finance consulting services, workshops, training, \nequipment, and software. It will require an estimated 74 person-months of consulting services (34 \nperson-months of international consultants and 40 person-months of national consultants). The \nmain fields of expertise will be urban planning, institutional reform, capacity building, and the GIS. \nProceeds  of  the  TA  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n19.  The TA will engage a consulting firm and individual consultants. The consulting firm will \nhave total inputs of 66 person-months (30 international and 36 national). The firm will be selected \nthrough the quality- and cost-based selection method with a 90:10 ratio.6 ADB\u2019s full technical \nproposal  will  be  used  to  select  and  engage  the  consultants.  The  individual  consultants \n(international  and  national)  will  have  total  inputs  of  8  person-months.  The  outline  terms  of \nreference  are  in  Appendix  3.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The equipment for \nTA implementation will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as \namended from time to time) and will be turned over to MUB after completion of the TA. \n \n20.  During TA implementation, a report on the strategic urban development of Ulaanbaatar \nwill be produced as a knowledge product. After completion of the TA, another report will be \nproduced to disseminate the evaluation of outputs and expected outcome with lessons learned \nfrom capacity development activities in urban planning practices in Ulaanbaatar. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 to the Government \nof Mongolia to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction  for \nUlaanbaatar Urban Planning Improvement, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n5 This TA will support the formulation of improved community-led local planning in the targeted areas of the ADB \nProposed  Multitranche  Financing  Facility  to  Mongolia  for  the  Ulaanbaatar  Urban  Services  and  Ger  Areas \nDevelopment Investment Program. While the JICA project on Advisor for Urban Planning and Urban Planning Law \nwill  focus  on  the  legal  framework  and  redevelopment  issues  in  Ulaanbaatar  working  with  MUB\u2019s  Ger  Area \nDevelopment Agency, this TA will focus on urban planning capacity building in Ulaanbaatar working with MUB\u2019s \nMPACC and UPADI.   \n6 The selection ratio is considered appropriate because of the complexity of the subject and the high technical \nqualification requirement. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact  By 2020    Assumptions \nImproved living  Funding gap in urban  National Statistical Office  Implementation and \nconditions in  infrastructure is addressed  reports  operation arrangements \nUlaanbaatar  in the urban plans     of other infrastructure \n(Urban infrastructure    projects are going \ninvestment by MUB in    smoothly once planning \nUlaanbaatar is increased  capacity is improved. \nby 20%.
