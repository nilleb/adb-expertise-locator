On 12 December 2000 the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved (i) the Private \nSector Development Program (PSDP) cluster; (ii) subprogram I of the PSDP comprising two \nloans amounting to $85 million equivalent from the Asian Development Fund and $15 million \nfrom ADB's ordinary capital resources; and (iii) technical assistance (TA) for Governance and \nInstitutional Support for Private Sector Development. \n \n2.  Due to the uncertain security situation resulting from the civil war and the high level of \npublic debt at the time of the design of the PSDP, caution was exercised to avoid adding \npressure to the public budget or placing additional demands that could disrupt economic stability \nand  growth.  As  a  result,  the  PSDP  was  structured  as  a  cluster  with  two  subprograms: \nsubprogram  I  and  subprogram  II.  Depending  on  progress  in  implementing  subprogram  I, \nsatisfactory macroeconomic management, and the Government of Sri Lanka's commitment to \nundertake proposed reforms, subprogram II would be processed for Board consideration. \n \n3.  PSDP subprogram I supports the creation of an enabling environment for private sector \ndevelopment by focusing on five broad areas: (i) sustaining and reinforcing the Government\u2019s \nprivatization  and  public  enterprise  reform  program,  (ii)  facilitating  private  sector  entry  and \nparticipation in infrastructure development, (iii) enhancing the market system by promoting fair \ncompetition and appropriate regulation of private sector activity, (iv) increasing labor market \nmobility while providing adequate protection to workers, and (v) improving private sector access \nto finance. \n \n4.  The first tranche of subprogram I was released upon loan effectiveness on 31 January \n2001, the second on 19 December 2002, and the third and final tranche was released on 21 \nNovember 2003. \n \n5.  Due to the satisfactory progress in implementing subprogram I1 and (i) the improved \nsecurity situation resulting from the second year of a cease-fire agreement after a 20-year civil \nwar; (ii) improved economic growth and macroeconomic stability (real gross domestic product \ngrowth rate has been in the range of 5.5\u20136.0% since mid-2002); (iii) reduction in the fiscal deficit \nto budgeted 7.5% in 2003, compared with 8.9% in 2002 and 10.0% in 2001; and (iv) the \nGovernment\u2019s  policy  reforms  introduced  in  subprogram  I  to  stimulate  private  sector \ndevelopment, project preparatory technical assistance (TA) for subprogram II was included in \nthe 2003 Country Strategy and Program. A Fact-Finding Mission was fielded to Colombo in \nAugust  2003  and  reached  understanding  with  the  Government  on  the  objectives,  scope, \nfinancing plan, and implementation arrangements for the TA. The TA2 is designed to build on \nADB\u2019s earlier assistance and support efforts for further policy reforms to stimulate private sector \ndevelopment that were identified as critical areas in the Government\u2019s national development \nstrategy, Regaining Sri Lanka. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n6.  The future growth of private sector development requires that follow-on initiatives should \ncontinue to adequately address major impediments to private sector participation. \n                                                 \n1  All 10 conditions for the third and final tranche release of subprogram I have been fully or substantially met. \nProgram implementation is discussed in ADB. 2003.  Private Sector Development Program Progress Report: \nRelease of Third Tranche. Manila. (Loans 1800 and 1801-SRI). \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 19 March 2003. ", "2   \n7.  Capital Market.  Limited access to financing, particularly long-term financing, and the \nhigh cost of funds in the country hinder increased private sector activity. The financial system \ncontinues to be dominated by the banking sector and by state-owned institutions. The latter \nhave a large presence in banking, insurance, and provident funds; they control over 60% of the \ntotal assets of financial institutions and utilize over 50% of the country\u2019s financial resources. \nAssets of institutional investors amount to approximately one third of the total assets of banks. \nDespite their large relative size, their impact on financial market development and innovation \nthrough new products have been negligible, mainly because they have been used as a captive \nsource for funding primarily Government issued short-term debt. \n \n8.  There is a strong demand in the private sector for medium- and long-term debt financing, \nespecially for home mortgage financing; but the housing sector has been crowded out of the \nmarket due until recently, to the lack of a government yield curve for various medium- and long-\nterm maturities. Mortgage companies assume significant interest rate risk in their portfolios by \nmismatching  long-term  mortgage  lending  activities  with  short-term  borrowings.  Due  to  the \nlimited availability of long-term debt to the private sector, mortgage rates are high, and housing \nconstruction and job creation are reduced.  \n \n9.  The Stock Market. As a result of the cease-fire agreement in effect, the Colombo Stock \nExchange has substantially increased its market capitalization and trading volume during the \nlast 2 years. However, the number of products and services offered are still limited, especially in \nthe management of investment risk for issuers and investors, and asset management.  \n \n10.  The  Insurance  Industry.  The  working  population  in  the  country  with  access  to \ninsurance is extremely low (5% for life insurance and 7% for general insurance), and there is \nsignificant  potential  for  growth  of  the  insurance  industry.  However,  almost  all  insurance \ncompanies  lack  financial  strength  and  some  companies  may  be  in  danger  of  technical \ninsolvency. Additionally, the insurance industry does not have a strong regulator to supervise \nand monitor it and implement international best practice accounting standards.3 \n \n11.  State-Owned  Enterprises  and  Government  Assets.  The  Government  has  made \nsignificant  inroads  in  the  sale  of  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs).  Since the approval of \nsubprogram I, proceeds from the sale of assets are in excess of $100 million. Yet, due to the \nfiscal burden resulting from the budget support to SOEs, the process of privatization must be \naccelerated and the inefficient operations of SOEs addressed.   \n \n12.  Commercialization of Government Owned Assets. Many services that are presently \nor could be offered by the Government can be more efficiently provided through public-private \npartnerships or joint ventures. Government assets (e.g., land and other assets used by railway \nstations, major bus terminals, and postal complex, etc.), which are strategically located, could \nalso be developed but the Government lacks the proper management and financial resources.   \n \n13.  Deregulation and Streamlining Regulations.  In its national strategy,  Regaining Sri \nLanka, the Government has identified barriers that reduce productivity and limit investment and \neconomic growth. The Government\u2019s economic policies are gradually being reformed to create \nan environment that promotes economic growth. The Government's focus is on reforming the \nregulatory process pertaining to obtaining approvals for (i) goods to pass through ports and \n                                                 \n3  Results from the TA ADB. 2000.

To promote private sector growth, new \nsystems and regulations that impose the least possible burden on economic performance4 \nshould be introduced. \n \n14.  Corporate  Governance.  To  improve  corporate  governance  in  the  public  sector, \nParliament passed a Code of Best Practices in Corporate Governance for Public Enterprises \n(Code). The Code must be implemented in all SOEs. Additionally, corporate governance must \nbe  improved  to  meet  international  best  practice  standards  in  the  private  sector  for  listed \ncompanies and securities on the Colombo Stock Exchange. There is also a significant need to \nimprove corporate ethics for financial service professionals. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n15.  Following up on the earlier TA and taking into account ongoing reforms in the private \nsector, in part supported by PSDP subprogram I, the proposed TA will further support private \nsector development as outlined in paras. 7-14 as well as assist in implementing reforms and \nremoving barriers to private sector development as outlined in Regaining Sri Lanka. The TA will \nassist in preparing PSDP subprogram II.   \n \n16.  The TA will prepare the overall design and principal implementation components of \nsubprogram II. The major components will focus on (i) continuing support to foster a competitive \ncapital  market  and  nonbank  financial  sector;  (ii)  reducing  Government  intervention  in \ncommercial activities by accelerating the privatization of SOEs and commercializing government \nowned assets; (iii) further strengthening corporate governance to enhance market discipline, \nand to implement international best practices for corporate governance in the public and private \nsectors; and (iv) supporting deregulation activities and streamlining regulations that undermine \neconomic growth.  The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n17.  As  a  collaborative  effort,  the  TA  will  be  implemented  in  close  consultation  with \nstakeholders. The World Bank, through its Poverty Reduction Support Credit, supports labor \nand land reforms, public enterprise restructuring, private participation in infrastructure, and \nfinancial  sector  reforms.  The  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC),  Swedish \nInternational  Development  Cooperation  Agency  (Sida),  and  United  States  Agency  for \nInternational Development (USAID) support an enabling environment for business development. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n18.  The TA will engage international and domestic consultants who will work closely with the \nexecuting and implementing agencies, market participants, and ADB in the following areas: \n \n1.  Capital Market and Nonbank Financial Sector \n19.  The TA will explore ways of improving and deepening the products and services offered \nin the nonbank financial market, including the need to increase the issuance of medium- and \nlong-term  bonds  and  to  introduce  debt  and  equity-related  instruments  that  provide  risk \n                                                 \n4  Part of the policy reform being implemented under policy Loan 1894.

Manila. \n ", "4   \nmanagement products for issuers and investors. The TA will support improving the quality of \nasset management services presently available and recommend changes to  promote new \nproducts and services.  \n \n20.  The TA will explore the possibility of introducing in the capital market publicly traded \nsecuritized obligations (e.g., asset-backed and/or pass-through bonds) for home mortgages.  \nThe experience with secured transactions reform and development of securitized instruments \nfor the South Asian region will be analyzed. The use of securitized instruments in other sectors \n(e.g., infrastructure, financing companies, etc.) will be reviewed.  \n \n21.  The focus will be on further strengthening the insurance market. The TA will review the \nimplementation  of  regulations  for  the  nonbank  financial  sector  and  make  suitable \nrecommendations for enhancing effectiveness, as appropriate. \n \n2.  Private Sector Participation in Restructuring State-Owned Enterprises and \nDeveloping Government-Owned Assets \n22.  Although accelerating the sale of SOEs to the private sector is a high priority of the \nGovernment, making some SOEs commercially viable can have significant restructuring costs \n(e.g., need for working capital, capital investment, capacity building for retraining employees, \nand retrenching employees). Additionally, business units within some of the larger SOEs could \nbe spun off into smaller enterprises to commercially benefit from private sector intervention. The \nTA will explore the possibility of creating a loan facility (Fund) to facilitate the financing of \nacquired SOEs for private sector buyers. The possibility of obtaining co-investors (local and/or \ninternational, debt and/or equity) for the Fund will be explored. The TA will also assess the \npossibilities  of  commercializing  Government-owned  assets  through  public-private  limited \npartnerships and/or joint ventures with the private sector.  \n \n3.  Corporate Governance \n \n23.  Taking  into  account  work  already  done  by  the  Government,  ADB,  and  other  aid \nagencies, the TA will (i) improve and expand the implementation of the Code; (ii) review and \nrecommend changes in financial governance and business ethics for publicly listed companies \n(listed or not) issuing publicly traded securities; and (iii) recommend rules and regulations for \nimproving business ethics for financial service professionals. \n \n4.  Deregulation and Streamlining the Regulatory Process \n \n24.  The TA will analyze the systems, time and costs of obtaining regulatory approval for (i) \nports and customs clearance of goods, and (ii) starting and operating a business enterprise. \nRecommendations will be made for the design of new systems for both areas, as well as for \nmanagement information systems.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n25.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,000,000 equivalent comprising $680,000 in \nforeign  exchange  and  $320,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  ADB  will  provide  $800,000 \nequivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $120,000 equivalent of the local \ncurrency cost. The Government will contribute $200,000 equivalent to fund counterpart staff, \noffice facilities and administrative services. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTA funding program. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n ", "       5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n26.  The Ministry of Finance will be the Executing Agency. The TA will be implemented over \n6 months starting in February 2004 and ending in August 2004. A team of 9 international \nconsultants and 6 domestic consultants will provide 28 person-months of consulting services \n(14 international, and 14 domestic). The international consultant for the secured transaction \nanalysis  will  be  recruited  on  a  direct  selection  basis,  and  all  others  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The quality-based selection method will \nbe applied in selecting the consultants because of the relative complexity of the program, which \ncovers  a  number  of  subsectors,  debt  and  equity  markets,  institutional  investors,  nonbank \nfinancial intermediaries, and market infrastructure. The issues are highly sensitive and will \nrequire high-level policy interaction with government officials and extensive consultations with \nother stakeholders, particularly aid agencies in the field. The consultants must have high level of \ncredibility and competence. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. \n \n27.  In support of the TA activities, the executing and implementing agencies (e.g., Ministry of \nFinance, Customs Department, etc) will provide (i) furnished office space for the consultants \nand access to a conference room, (ii) secretarial support, and (iii) local communication facilities \nfor the consultants in Colombo. The Government will release two full-time counterpart staff to \nwork as part of the deregulation team. Additional staff will be made available on a part-time \nbasis, as necessary. \n \n28.  The consultants will submit an inception report to the Government and ADB within 2 \nweeks of the start of work; an interim report halfway through the engagement, which would \nincorporate  a  draft  policy  matrix;  and  a  draft  final report 2 weeks before the end of the \nengagement.  The  draft  final  report  will  be  discussed  at  a  tripartite  meeting  involving  the \nGovernment,  the  consultants,  and  ADB.  The  final  report  will  incorporate  results  from  the \nmeeting and be made available 2 weeks from the date of the meeting. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n29.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  for  preparing  the  Private  Sector  Development  Program \n(Subprogram II), and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance    Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets  Monitoring Mechanisms  and Risks \n       \nGoal   \nAssist the Government in  Technical assistance (TA) \nformulating a program of  interim and final reports \npolicy reforms to support   \nprivate sector development  Tripartite meeting of \nand growth by  Government, consultants, \n  and the Asian Development \nBank (ADB)  \n \n(i)  Eliminating impediments  Reduce the cost and time to    Political will to implement \nto private sector  obtain necessary regulatory  policy reforms \ndevelopment  approvals for (i) goods   \npassing through ports and   \ncustoms; and (ii) \nestablishing and operating \nbusinesses \n \n(ii)  Adopting market- Eliminate areas that create    Systemic implementation of \noriented policies and  distortions in the capital  policy reform program to \nincreasing reliance on  market and deter private  promote a more conducive \nand use of market  sector growth  environment for the private \nmechanisms to support  sector \nprivate sector growth   \n  Further financial reforms and    Policy changes inadequate \nfostering a competitive  to meet required reforms of \ncapital market  the capital market \n \n  Remove Government from    Restructuring costs of state-\nall commercial activities that  owned enterprises (SOEs) \ncan be more efficiently  too high to attract private \nundertaken by the private  sector investors \nsector \n \n       \nPurpose   \n   \n1.
