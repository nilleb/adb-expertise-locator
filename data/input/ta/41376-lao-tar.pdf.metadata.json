The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) is a landlocked, low-income country \nwith a scattered population of about 6 million people and a per capita income of $550 per \nannum. About 20% of its population lives on less than $1 per day. Major public health problems \nand market failure in its health sector affect household productivity and cause serious income \nerosion for the poor. The Government of the Lao PDR (the Government) identifies the health \nsector  as  one  of  four  priority  sectors  for  fighting  poverty  and  achieving  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs).1  \n  \n2.  According to the long-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020) of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB),2 the health sector is not a core sector for ADB, and direct investment \nin it will be considered case by case. The Lao health sector makes a good case. While the \nneeds are evident, the Government has shown strong leadership in and commitment to the \nsector. It highly appreciates ADB\u2019s leadership role and long-term commitment in the sector. \nADB projects have focused on the MDGs and governance and financing reforms and have \nshown  strong  performance.  The  sector  remains  seriously  underfunded,  both  in  terms  of \ndomestic resources and a paucity of partners.3 The Government has asked ADB to support the \nhealth sector in its transition to a new aid architecture and help ensure that past investments are \nsustained.   \n \n3.  The proposed Health Sector Development Program (the SDP) is included in the country \noperations business plan (2008\u20132010) for the Asian Development Fund funding of $22 million in \n2009.4 The ADB fact-finding mission for project preparatory technical assistance (TA) was \nfielded from 28 July to 4 August 2008 and reached an understanding with the Government on \nthe program scope and modality and on TA design and implementation arrangements. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  The Lao PDR has made good progress toward the health-related MDGs 1, 4, and 5. The \nchild mortality rate declined from 170 to 98 per 1,000 live births between 1990 and 2005, \ncompared with a target of 55 in 2015. Infants account for three quarters of child mortality. The \nmaternal mortality ratio declined from 750 to 405 per 100,000 live births between 1990 and \n2005, compared with a target of 185 in 2015. The malnutrition rate (weight by age), may have \ndeclined from 40% to 30% between 1990 and 2005, compared with a target of 20% in 2015. \nThe  Lao  PDR  is  surrounded  by  countries  with  HIV/AIDS.  The  Lao HIV  prevalence  is still \nincreasing  but  may  remain  concentrated  in  high-risk  groups.  Progress  in  tuberculosis  and \nmalaria control programs are threatened by emerging drug resistance.  \n \n5.  The Government is committed to \u201cHealth for All.\u201d The main vehicle for achieving this is to \nprovide all citizens access to primary health care (PHC). The Ministry of Health (MOH) has \ndeveloped  a  poverty-focused  strategic  health-development  plan  for  the  period  2006\u20132010 \ncurrently budgeted at $560 million, or $22 per person per year, compared to the international \n                                                 \n1  Government of the Lao PDR. 2006.

Manila. \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 13 August 2008. \n ", "2   \nminimum standard of $34.6 Current public and private spending is only $12 per person per year, \nof which $7 is out of pocket and $3 from partners. MOH is proceeding with the preparation of \nthe next strategic sector plan for 2011\u20132015, which would clearly spell out Government priorities \nand potential support from partners in various subsectors. The sector remains highly dependent \non external funding until broad-based revenue and expenditure reforms have materialized.  \n \n6.  ADB has been an important partner in the Lao health sector for the past decade. It has \nassisted MOH to (i) develop PHC in the eight northern provinces, with the World Bank providing \nsimilar assistance in the southern provinces; (ii) strengthen provincial health systems nationwide; \nand (iii) control emerging and neglected endemic communicable diseases.  \n \n7.  With the support of ADB and other partners, the MOH has established a basic PHC \nnetwork of hospitals, health centers, and trained village health volunteers (VHVs). The Primary \nHealth Care Expansion Project helped develop this network in 8 northern provinces covering \nabout 2 million people including 56% ethnic minorities.7 Between 2004 and 2006, the use of \npublic health facilities as the first place of care increased from 21% to 39% for ethnic minority \ngroups, and from 37% to 50% for others in these provinces. Deliveries in health facilities \nincreased from 5% to 8% for ethnic minorities, and 18% to 28% for others. Immunization \ncoverage doubled. The increase in demand is due to better access, drugs supply, and staff \nquality, in addition to increased education and affordability. However, the use of health services \nis still low at 0.45 visits per year, and much lower for some ethnic groups. This is not because of \ncompeting services: the mainly urban private sector is small, and the use of traditional health \ncare is low. The public health system itself needs further strengthening in two major areas, \nnamely (i) access, quality, and affordability of PHC; and (ii) sector management and financing.   \n \n8.  Lao is a low population density country making it difficult to provide good access for \nremote populations. In 2006, 76% of ethnic minorities had access to VHVs, but only 39% had \naccess to a health center within 1 hour of travel. The Government can ill afford operating a \nhealth center in each hamlet, so VHVs play an important role. However, existing health centers \nand hospitals often lack staff, in particular for maternal and child health (MCH). Achieving MDGs \n4 and 5 in Lao PDR will depend on making VHVs and MCH staff available, including specialists, \nmidwives and female staff from ethnic minorities. MOH and its partners are developing specific \nplans to improve access to MCH according to minimum service standards at all levels. Staff \nquality also needs further improvement. MOH is preparing a human resource development \n(HRD) policy and a staff management system to improve training, accreditation, and quality \ncontrol. In addition, older facilities not included in previous projects require repair and new \nequipment. The introduction of cost recovery in 1995 improved drugs supply and provided some \nincentive for staff. However, affordability of health care for the poor has reduced since then. \nTransport charges, fees, and indirect cost of health care, in particular for catastrophic illnesses \nsuch as obstetric emergencies, are often prohibitive for the poor. A caesarian section may easily \ncost several hundred dollars. As part of the effort to achieve MDGs, pilot health equity funds and \nother initiatives to make health care more affordable for the poor will need to be scaled up.  \n \n9.  Low demand and substandard health care is also caused by management and financing \nproblems in the sector resulting in considerable inefficiencies. While PHC receives high priority, \nthe health sector has been input driven and the recurrent budget has remained very low.

Manila. \n ", "      3\nsalaries are a major reason for staff absenteeism. Recently, more results-oriented instruments \nhave been introduced such as provincial strategic and annual planning and budgeting cycles, \nand results-based financing. However, a major challenge remains to improve the coordination of \nprograms and projects at central level into a sector approach.   \n \n10.  Following the Vientiane Declaration on Aid Effectiveness in 2006,8 the Government has \nmoved to develop sector-wide approaches with its partners. Progress has been made. The \nWorld Bank and its partners9 provide support for public expenditure reforms. Public sector \nfundamentals are being improved through the 2006 budget law and other vehicles. The Ministry \nof Education and other ministries have pioneered a sector approach, initially with considerable \nuncertainty. The ministries are now committed to developing this further, in view of it being a \nmore strategic and transparent approach with expected impact and efficiency gains.  \n \n11.  MOH is planning to develop a sector approach, with support of the Ministry of Finance \n(MOF) and the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI). Major progress has been made in the \npast two years. MOH and partners have endorsed the new sector coordination framework for \nhealth, and there is general agreement on the way forward.10 The partners are assisting MOH \nwith standardizing maternal and child care and the health management information system. \nThree task forces are working on health financing, HRD, and PHC (with a focus on MCH).  \n \n12.  ADB\u2019s Health System Development Project,11 approved in 2007 for a period of 4 years is \nalso assisting MOH in preparing building blocks for a sector approach. ADB is helping MOH \nprepare the HRD policy, improve several training, strengthen provincial planning and budgeting, \npilot a results-based approach and health equity funds, and develop the next 5-year plan (2011-\n2015). The 5-year plan is expected to help with aid coordination and mobilizing funds to address \nthe overall funding gap in the sector, including for PHC. This will require MOH to strengthen and \ninstitutionalize  its  secretariat  for  the  sector  working  group  for  health  to  provide  ongoing \nleadership, resources, information management and coordination.  \n \n13.  MOH, the MOF, and the MPI asked ADB to consider an SDP modality in support of the \nnext 5-year plan that will contribute to achieving MDGs 1, 4 and 5. Two major priorities for \nconsolidating and possibly furthering ADB\u2019s support to the sector are in line with ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2020, namely (i) maximizing past investments in the 8 northern provinces to achieve MDGs; and \n(ii) helping develop the sector approach to improve overall sector performance in terms of \nefficiency, effectiveness and sustainability. The SDP\u2019s project investment would support PHC, \nwith a focus on MCH, in the eight northern provinces in terms of improving access, quality, \nacceptability, affordability, and management. The SDP\u2019s program investment would support \nMOH and the partners to develop the sector approach and provide complementary support for \nstandardizing MCH services, the HRD policy, personnel management, making health care more \naffordable for the poor though health equity funds, and results-based planning and budgeting. \nThe proposed SDP investment is estimated at $22 million for a period of 4 years.    \n \n \n \n                                                 \n8  Government of the Lao PDR. 2006.

The joint \nadministration  of  several  projects  appears  to  be  working  well.  However,  the  policy  and \nadministrative environment of projects requires ongoing adjustment.

The TA will result in improved demand for public health services, in particular from \nwomen, children, and ethnic minorities. The TA outcome is a draft health SDP proposal by April \n2009. An initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n16.  The TA will help (i) appraise national and provincial sector development and related \ngovernance and financing aspects, including aid coordination; (ii) appraise PHC performance \nwith a focus on MCH care, HRD, and affordability; (iii) conduct a participatory planning process \nto identify priorities for project and program support under the health SDP; and (iv) prepare the \ndraft health SDP proposal and implementation plan for possible ADB assistance.  \n \n17.  Toward possible program support, the TA work will include a review of (i) health policy \nand  regulations;  (ii)  health  sector  planning  and  financing;  (iii)  the  sector  approach  being \ndeveloped  by  MOH  and  its  partners  and  related  policy  developments  and  institutional \narrangements;  (iv)  MOH  capacity  and  aid  coordination;  (v)  provincial  health  system \ndevelopment, including sector coordination and aid harmonization, planning and budgeting, and \nresults-based management; (vi) HRD; (vii) the health management information system; and (viii) \nfinancial management.  \n \n18.  Toward possible project support, the TA work will include a review of (i) needs for \nupgrading  facilities  and  equipment,  (ii)  options  to  improve  the  quality  and  acceptability  of \nservices with a focus on comprehensive MCH care and the \u201chealthy village,\u201d (iii) priorities for \nimplementing the HRD policy and plan,12 and (iv) the proposed expansion of health equity funds \nto eight northern provinces.    \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n19.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $575,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $500,000 \nequivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The \nGovernment will provide $75,000 equivalent through in-kind contributions for counterpart staff, \nfacilities, transport, and provincial data collection. The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 3. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB \nto finance any ensuing SDP.  \n \n \n                                                 \n12 Including improving standards and quality control, nursing and midwifery schools, the Louang Phrabang PHC \nfamily doctor school, midlevel PHC workers schools, village health workers, the university of health sciences, and \npublic health and professional associations. \n ", "      5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  MOH will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The MOH steering committee, chaired by \nthe Minister of Health and including representatives of MPI and MOF, will review and guide TA \nwork, if and when required. Tripartite meetings of the Government, ADB, and consultants will be \nheld at inception, midterm, and completion of the TA. The Planning and Finance Department of \nMOH will be responsible for TA implementation. MOH has nominated a project director and a \nfull-time deputy project director for the TA. The project director will provide overall leadership \nand chair weekly team meetings to guide and coordinate TA activities. The deputy project \ndirector will provide liaison with stakeholders, among other responsibilities. In each province, the \nprovincial health team will conduct a basic provincial health account and prepare a provincial 5-\nyear plan and medium-term expenditure framework. Technical working groups for MCH care, \nHRD, and health financing will provide technical advice, as will experts from other ministries and \npartners.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA,  engage  the  consultants,  and  provide  technical \nbackstopping.   \n \n21.  ADB will support 13 person-months of international consulting services, including a team \nleader and health sector reform expert (5 person-months), health economist (3), sociologist (2), \nresettlement expert (1), and engineer and environment expert (2). Fifteen person-months of \nnational consulting services will include an HRD expert (5), financial management expert (5), \nand engineer (5). All consultants will be engaged through a firm using the biodata technical \nproposal and fixed budget selection method in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants are in Appendix 4. Equipment will be procured under the TA by MOH in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and retained by it on \ncompletion of the TA. MOH will open a separate account to manage the funds for the office, \nworkshops, field work, and data collection. \n   \n22.  The TA team of consultants and counterparts will prepare an inception plan for the TA \nbased on initial consultations and scoping and submit it within 1 month to MOH and ADB. This \nwill be followed by specific appraisals of relevant subsectors and dialogue with stakeholders to \nidentify issues and options for investment. The midterm report will be submitted after 2 months, \nincluding  reviews  of  the  Health  System  Development  Project  and  similar  projects,  and  of \nprogress in building blocks towards a health sector coordination approach. Then the team will \nconduct a 2-month participatory planning process to prepare a draft SDP proposal, which will be \nfinalized with Government and ADB inputs over the next month. MOH will organize three \nworkshops for stakeholders, at the inception, midterm, and draft final stages. The draft final \nreport will be submitted after 4 months, and a final report and implementation memorandum \nwithin 5 months. The TA work will begin on 15 December 2008 and be completed by 15 June \n2009.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for preparing the Health Sector \nDevelopment Program, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1   \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \n  Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved demand for  Percentage of population  Household surveys and  \u2022 PHC improvements are \npublic health services  using a health facility in  health service surveys in  sufficient to trigger \nthe past month increased  the eight northern  increased demand for \nfrom 35% in 2010 to 55%  provinces in 2010, 2012  health services from the \nin 2014 (disaggregated  and 2014   poor, women, children, and \nby age, sex, income, and    ethnic minorities. \nethnic group)  Health facility and village   \n  reporting systems  Risk \nPercentage of deliveries \n  \u2022 Increasing cost of fuel and \nassisted by trained birth \n     food may worsen poverty \nattendants in the past \n  and affect demand for \nyear increased from 25% \nhealth services.   \nin 2010 to 50% in 2014 \n \n(by ethnic group) \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nAn agreed draft SDP   Technically sound SDP  Memorandum of  \u2022 Partners support the SDP  \ndesign acceptable to  the  understanding for grant  design \nGovernment and ADB  fact-finding and appraisal   \narticulated by 15 May  between the Government  \u2022 The Government commits \n2009  and ADB    to sustaining proposed SDP \npolicy reform and PHC   \n  \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nThe Government of Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) identifies the health sector as one of four priority sectors. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) Country Operations Business Plan 2008\u20132010 for Lao PDR gives priority to the health \nsector. The health sector plays a major role in poverty reduction as poverty rates are high, the cost of medical care is a major \nreason for new poverty, disease among the poor affects their productivity, income is eroded because of the poor quality of care, \nand widespread poverty requires government intervention to make services available and affordable.   \nB.     Targeting Classification          \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention (GI)   Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n \n2.  Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \nThe sector development program (SDP) will strengthen the provincial health system\u2019s ability to provide better primary health \ncare, make health care more affordable for the poor, and make health care more acceptable to women, ethnic minorities, and \nother vulnerable groups. It will support the sector program approach. The technical assistance (TA) will analyze health service \nperformance, quality of care, human resource development, health financing, and management, and it will propose policy \nreforms, capacity building, and investments. The purpose is to establish a process of year-by-year upgrading of provincial \nhealth services based on needs and results, rather than inputs, to make services more equitable, efficient, and effective. The \nanalysis will include an assessment of physical, social, and financial access to health services and whether health service \nmanagement is pro-poor and gender-equal. It will access opportunities for women and ethnic minorities and specific issues for \nvulnerable groups. The analysis will also assess the potential benefits of reform and investment for the poor. \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  Poverty impact analysis will be done through household and health service surveys measuring the use of health services.  \n \n2.  These surveys are already financed under an ongoing project. \n \n3. The proposed SDP includes measures to enhance social inclusion through scholarships for ethnic minorities, cross \nsubsidies through health equity funds, and pro-poor governance through better planning and budgeting.  \n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  The services to be improved directly benefit rural people, in particular the poor, women, children, and ethnic minorities.  \n \n2.  Measures are taken to improve financial and social access for these vulnerable groups. \n \n3.  The SDP will improve financial access by expanding health equity funds to all eight northern provinces and improve social \naccess by training women, ethnic minorities, and village health volunteers.  \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.   Stakeholders include the beneficiaries, in particular the poor, women, children, and ethnic minorities; health staff; \n  provincial governments; and central ministries and partners.    \n  \n2.   Consultations will involve field visits, meetings with health staff, workshops, and dialogue with government officials and \n  development partners.  \n3.   What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n     Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n \n4.   Will a consultation and participation plan be prepared?    Yes          No    Please explain.  \n  The TA includes a sociologist who will ensure adequate consultation with stakeholders.   \n \n ", "8  Appendix 2 \nC.  Gender and Development \n1. What are the key gender issues in the sector and/or subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project or program? \nThe TA will develop a gender strategy and plan to emphasize the needs of women, in particular regarding reproductive health \nand access to acceptable, affordable, quality health services. It will examine ways to provide employment opportunities and \nsocial protection to minority women. The strategy will incorporate the views of beneficiaries, including women from ethnic \nminorities.   \n2.
