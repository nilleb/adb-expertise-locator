During the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country programming mission in December \n2012, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested ADB to provide \npolicy and advisory technical assistance (TA) to help the Shaanxi provincial government (SPG) \nwith watershed management for the Weihe River.1 The TA was then included in ADB\u2019s country \noperations business plan, 2013\u20132015 for the PRC.2 In April 2013, an ADB mission visited \nShaanxi Province, and reached an understanding with the SPG on the TA impact, outcome, and \noutputs; cost estimates and financing plan; implementation arrangements; and consultants\u2019 \nterms of reference. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The TA will build \non achievements of the River Basin and Water Resources Allocation and Management Policy \nTA,3 and support SPG efforts for river basin water resources management. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Weihe River, the longest tributary of the Yellow River, is considered the main river \nof Shaanxi. Originating from Niaoshu Mountain in Weiyuan County of Gansu Province, the river \nruns from west to east through Gansu and Shaanxi provinces and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous \nRegion, and joins the Yellow River at Tongguan County in Shaanxi. It is 818 kilometers (km) \nlong; 502 km are in Shaanxi (61.4% of the total). Historically the river has played an important \nrole in the development of Shaanxi. The Weihe River basin covers 135,000 square kilometers \n(km2); 67,100 km2 are in Shaanxi (49.7% of the total). The average annual volume of self-\ngenerated water resources reaches 6.99 billion cubic meters.  \n \n3.  Intense economic development since the 1990s within the river watershed has resulted \nin problems, including increasing water resource scarcity and water pollution. Annually, 317 \ncubic meters of water are available per capita (13% of the national average). The treatment of \nwaste and polluted water is challenging as 78% of water in the main river channel is classified \nas exceeding class V.4   \n \n4.  Water flow in the river is currently highly regulated. Twenty-six dams and reservoirs (four \nare large and the remaining medium-sized) regulate water flow and contribute to hydropower \nproduction.  The  province  is  nonetheless  facing  a  water  resource  scarcity  primarily  due  to \ncompeting demands for available water resources from the river. Shaanxi has implemented \nmeasures to meet stakeholder demands and requirements. However, the lack of a coordinated \nmechanism to address competing demands has resulted in conflict between administrative units \nalong the river in Shaanxi.  \n \n5.  To address the broader watershed and water management issues of the Weihe River in \nShaanxi, in 2006 the Shaanxi Provincial Water Resources Department (SPWRD) established \nthe Weihe River Management Bureau (WRMB). Water management issues include the need to \nmeet water allocation demands for the Yellow River downstream, in addition to demands of \nvarious sectors and administrative units along the Weihe River itself. However, due to the \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 9 August 2013. \n2  ADB. 2013.

The \nSPG recently invested in river modification projects based on recommendations of the Key \nProjects for Improvement of the Weihe River Basin, approved by the State Council in 2005. The \nprojects include construction of embankments along various sections of the river to mitigate \nflooding.  A  water  transfer  project from  the  Han  River  to  the Weihe River,  currently  being \nconstructed, is to supplement the increased demand for water resources from the Weihe River.  \n \n6.  In January 2013, the SPG passed the 2012 Shaanxi Provincial Weihe River Watershed \nManagement Regulations, which cover planning, water resources management, water pollution \nprevention, flood management, river course management, and ecological rehabilitation. In light \nof these new regulations, the technical assistance (TA) will (i) review the range of key water \nmanagement  issues  affecting  Weihe  River,  and  prepare  a  strategic  framework  with \nmanagement recommendations; and (ii) provide recommendations for improved organizational \narrangements for watershed and water resources management in the Weihe River basin.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The  TA  will  contribute  to  improved  environmental  management  and  sustainable \ndevelopment  in  Shaanxi  by  supporting  SPG  efforts  to  enhance  watershed  management \napproaches  to  improve  water  resources  management.  The  impact  will  be  the  sustainable \nmanagement of water resources in the Weihe River basin in Shaanxi province. The outcome will \nbe improved strategic planning and organizational arrangements for management of the Weihe \nRiver watershed.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The  TA  will  have  three  outputs:  (i)  a  strategic  framework  with  management \nrecommendations for watershed and water resources management in the Weihe River basin; (ii) \nimproved  organizational  setup  for  management  of  the  Weihe  River  watershed;  and  (iii) \nenhanced communication and awareness of river basin water management issues. As water \nmanagement and allocation is often a very challenging topic due to the range of stakeholders \nand competing demands, the TA will incorporate the principles of integrated water resources \nmanagement  from  the  onset  of  TA  implementation.  Key  stakeholders  and  sectors  will  be \nengaged  from  the  start  to  support  the  development  of  the  strategic  framework  for  water \nresources management. Numerous small-scale consultation workshops with key water user \ngroups and administrative units are anticipated during TA implementation. The communication \nand participation strategy, which will include transprovincial engagement and input due to the \ntransboundary nature of the Weihe River, will be presented at the TA inception workshop to \ndemonstrate good governance and wide participation in TA implementation.  \n \n9.  Output  1:  A  strategic  framework  with  management  recommendations  for \nwatershed  and  water  resources  management  in  the  Weihe  River  basin.  The  TA  will \nfacilitate the development of a strategic framework and management recommendations for \nwater  resources  management  in the Weihe  River  basin  through  a review  of major  issues \naffecting  water  resources  management  in  the  basin  and  introduction  of  international  best \npractice  approaches  for  integrated  basin  water  resources  management.  The  strategic \n ", "  3 \nframework will also serve to operationalize priorities5 identified in the 2012 Shaanxi Provincial \nWeihe River Watershed Management Regulations, and will build on successes and challenges \nof past efforts. Development of the framework will consider existing issues and recent river \nimprovement interventions. It may include medium- to long-term methods and approaches6 for \ndeveloping measures to resolve the most urgent water resource management problems, and \nmedium- to long-term approaches to address other priorities identified in the 2012 Shaanxi \nProvincial Weihe River Watershed Management Regulations. The framework and management \nrecommendations will include the identification and development of a coordinated monitoring \nprogram for key water resource management issues. To achieve this output, the following key \nactivities are anticipated: (i) review international approaches for allocating and managing water \nfor multifunctional purposes in highly modified or regulated rivers,7 and make recommendations \nfor the Weihe River; (ii) review and identify major issues affecting water resources management \nand  water  allocation  for  the  Weihe  River,  and  highlight  intermunicipal  and  potential \ninterprovincial issues; (iii) conduct a study tour of selected river basin management authorities;8 \n(iv)  prepare  recommendations  for  best  practice  in  water  resources  management  in  highly \nregulated and multifunctional river bodies; and (v) prepare a draft strategic framework with \nmanagement  recommendations9 for  resolving  issues  and  enhancing  cooperation  in  water \nresources management in the Weihe River basin.  \n \n10.  Output 2: An improved organizational setup for management of the Weihe River \nwatershed. To support the new WRMB mandate and implementation of the strategic framework \nand  management  recommendation  in  output  1,  the  TA  will  review  and  propose  improved \norganizational  arrangements  for  management  of  the  Weihe  River  watershed.  Anticipated \nactivities include (i) review the organizational and administrative challenges of managing water \nresources in the Weihe River basin, including assessing key advantages and limitations of the \ncurrent management and coordination arrangements, and review the existing regulations for \nWeihe River watershed management and municipal and/or county applications; and (ii) assess \nin  detail  the  scope  and  responsibilities  of  WRMB,  and  prepare  recommendations  for \norganizational improvement of the management of water resources in the river basin.  \n \n11.  Output  3:  Enhanced  communication  and  awareness  of  river  basin  water \nmanagement issues. WRMB will take the lead in preparing a comprehensive communications \nand participation strategy for TA implementation, and ensure relevant stakeholder participation \nin development of the strategic plan and management recommendations. Activities will include  \n(i) prepare a detailed communication and participation strategy with appropriate milestones to \nensure major water management stakeholders are engaged throughout TA implementation;  \n(ii) prepare one academic paper or publication on Weihe River water resources management \nissues; (iii) prepare a glossy information booklet on water management issues for the river and \nsolutions proposed with relevant stakeholders, i.e., to promote a provincial department of water \n                                                \n5  The priorities contained in the 2012 Shaanxi Provincial Weihe River Watershed Management Regulations include \nplanning management, water resources management, water pollution prevention and protection, flood protection \nmanagement, river course management, ecological construction and protection, management and supervision, and \nlegal responsibilities. \n6  The proposed approaches may include a comprehensive hydrometeorological monitoring system and licensing \nsystem to show how water resources are used and allocated.  \n7  Including flood control, irrigation, power generation, urban water supply, and ecological protection. \n8  The study tour will provide opportunity for local government officials to get access to \u201cinternational best-practice\u201d \napproaches for watershed and water resources management in highly regulated and multi-functional river systems. \nThe destination and program for the study tour will be determined during the TA inception phase with input from the \ninternational consultant and team leader. \n9  The WRMB  will  provide  the  consultants  with  the  specific  priorities  and  requirements  when  developing  the \nmanagement recommendations and/or model. \n ", "4   \nresources to lead the resolution of water management issues for the river; (iv) promote efforts to \nimprove cooperation on Weihe River water management issues in the local media (SPWRD); \nand (v) summarize key lessons from the strategic planning process in a knowledge product.  \n \n12.  Major assumptions include (i) relevant sectors have sufficient understanding of the need \nfor  more  coordinated  water  resources  management  and  organizational  reform,  and  are \ncommitted to making the required changes; and (ii) SPWRD and the Shaanxi Provincial Finance \nDepartment have sufficiently strong leadership and mandate. A key risk is that stakeholder \ngroups  may  have  conflicting  priorities for  water  demand;  some may  not  be  able to  reach \nconsensus on the strategies required for better watershed management in the Weihe River.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $430,000, of which $350,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013other sources).  \n \n14.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \nspace, office supplies, domestic transportation, workshop costs, administrative support, and \nother in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA will be implemented from 1 November 2013 to 30 June 2015. WRMB will be the \nexecuting agency and the Center for River Engineering Technical Research (a technical division \nof WRMB) will be the implementing agency. A TA management office is in place and will be \nresponsible for day-to-day operations with ADB, consultants, and related government agencies. \nThe head of WRMB is the executive director of the TA management office and the head of the \nCenter for River Engineering and Technical Research is the deputy director.  \n \n16.  SPG established a TA leading group to provide guidance on implementation issues and \nensure intra- and interdepartmental coordination. The group will provide advice and guidance to \nthe TA management office on interprovincial coordination needs, and ensure participation and \ninputs from the Yellow River Conservancy Commission throughout TA implementation. The \ndeputy  director  general  of  SPWRD  chairs  the  leading  group.  The  division  chiefs  of  the \nInternational  Cooperation  Division  of  the  Shaanxi  Provincial  Finance  Department  and  the \nForeign Cooperation and Science Technology Division of SPWRD will function as deputy chairs. \nMembers of the group include (i) deputy division chief of the International Cooperation Division; \n(ii) deputy director of the Shaanxi Provincial Weihe River Comprehensive Management Office; \n(iii)  directors  of  the  personnel  and  water  resources  divisions  of  SPWRD;  and  (iv)  deputy \ndirectors of the Weinan, Xi\u2019an, and Xianyang municipal water conservancy bureaus.  \n \n17.  The TA will require 3 person-months of international and 23 person-months of national \nconsulting  services.  Four  national  consultants  (river  basin  water  resources  management \nspecialist and team leader, legal specialist, institutional and organizational reform specialist, and \npublic administration and policy specialist) and one international river basin water resources \nmanagement specialist will be required for TA implementation. ADB will engage the individual \nconsultants in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  done  following  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  An  advance \npayment facility will be established for TA implementation.  \n \n ", "  5 \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n18.
