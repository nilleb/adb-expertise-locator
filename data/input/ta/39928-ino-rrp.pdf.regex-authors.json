THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nunsecured corporate loan without government guarantee of up to $75 million to PT Perusahaan \nGas Negara (Persero) Tbk (PGN); (ii) a proposed complementary loan of up to $75 million to \nPGN provided by one or more international commercial banks under ADB\u2019s complementary \nfinancing scheme (CFS); and (iii) a proposed complementary loan of up to $50 million to PGN \nprovided by Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) under ADB\u2019s CFS, for the South Sumatra to \nWest Java Phase II Gas Pipeline Project (the Project) in the Republic of Indonesia. If approved, \nthis will be the first ADB loan without government guarantee to a partially privatized state-owned \nenterprise (SOE) in Indonesia. \n \nII.  INTRODUCTION \n2.  Indonesia has abundant gas reserves and supplies approximately one fifth of the world\u2019s \nliquefied natural gas (LNG). Nevertheless, development of the country\u2019s natural gas resources \nfor domestic use has been slow, primarily because of the Government\u2019s policy of subsidizing \ndomestic petroleum product prices, which has historically caused gas prices to be relatively \nuncompetitive.  In  addition,  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  governing  exploration  and \nproduction of gas for domestic consumption has been unclear, and the commercial terms \noffered to investors have been relatively unattractive. As a result, the share of natural gas in the \ndomestic energy mix has remained below 30%. In 2005, as a result of steadily declining oil \nproduction and increased consumption, Indonesia became the only OPEC member country to \nbe a net importer of oil and oil products.  \n \n3.  The Government is now keen to reduce the country\u2019s reliance on oil and petroleum \nproducts and at the same time reduce the burden of fuel subsidies on the national budget, \nwhich would allow savings to be diverted to essential education, health, and infrastructure \nspending. To this end the Government took the bold step of increasing domestic oil prices by \n29% in March 2005 and by a further 126% in October 2005. These price increases are expected \nto lead to savings of about $10 billion in 2006 and have also provided a strong incentive for \nenergy consumers to switch to gas in order to mitigate the price increase. In parallel, the \nGovernment  is  supporting  the  development  of  the  domestic  gas  market  and  is  aiming  to \nincrease gas to at least 30% of the national energy mix by 2025.1 \n \n4.  PGN is Indonesia\u2019s leading provider of gas transmission services and the country\u2019s \ndominant  gas  distributor.  As  part  of  its  expansion  plans  PGN  is  developing  two  major \ntransmission pipelines that will link major gas fields in South Sumatra with major gas-consuming \nareas in West Java. One of these pipelines is the 661 km South Sumatra to West Java Phase II \nGas Pipeline Project.  \n \n5.  In April 2005, the Indonesian Ministry of Finance requested that ADB consider a loan to \nPGN on a stand-alone corporate basis without sovereign guarantee, to fund the Project. PGN \nsubsequently made the same request to ADB in early July 2005. In late July 2005, ING Bank \nsubmitted a letter to PGN, copied to ADB, proposing its role to underwrite and lend under ADB\u2019s \nCFS and arrange a debt tranche from one or more European bilateral institutions. In January \n2006, ADB and ING were mandated by PGN to structure an overall loan package in which the \nGerman development financing institution, KfW, and the Islamic Development Bank (IDB) have \nbeen invited to participate. Due diligence was carried out from January to May 2006. \n                                                 \n1  Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. 2005.

The Oil and Gas Sector  \n1.  Sector Background \n6.  Information on the oil and gas sector is in Appendix 2. Indonesia has significant reserves \nof oil, natural gas, and coal. The country is particularly well-endowed with natural gas resources, \nwith more than 90 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of proven reserves, the 13th largest gas reserves in the \nworld and the largest gas reserves of any country in Asia and Pacific region. Indonesia\u2019s proven \ngas reserves are three times the country\u2019s oil reserves on an energy-equivalent basis. Most of \nIndonesia\u2019s gas production is converted to LNG and exported to Japan; the Republic of Korea; \nand Taipei,China. Indonesia supplies about one fifth of the world\u2019s LNG from its gas fields in \nAceh and Kalimantan. Gas is also exported via pipeline to Singapore, including from Sumatra \nthrough the Grissik to Singapore pipeline, which was financed by the ADB. Indonesia is the \nworld\u2019s 6th largest gas producer. \n \n7.  Energy consumption in Indonesia is dominated by oil and gas, which together account \nfor 80% of the primary energy mix (Table 1). Since 2000, domestic oil production has declined \nbecause of the maturation of producing fields combined with a slower reserve replacement. \nOver the same period, the consumption of oil and oil products increased steadily. As a result in \n2005 Indonesia became a net importer of oil.  \n \nTable 1: Share of Different Energy Sources \n(%) \n \nEnergy Type  1990  1995  2000  2001  2002  2003 \n     \nCrude Oil and Oil Fuels   60.13 53.36 57.79 53.34 53.35  54.28 \nCoal   5.60 6.53 10.18 13.80 14.32  14.25 \nNatural Gas, LPG, and \nLNG   29.44 34.62 27.64 27.98 28.05  26.46 \nHydropower   4.38 3.82 3.22 3.48 2.87  3.58 \nGeothermal  0.44 0.61 1.18 1.40 1.40  1.44 \n     \nLNG = liquefied natural gas, LPG = liquid petroleum gas. \nSource: Government of Indonesia. \n \n8.  Since 2000, the share of natural gas in the domestic energy mix has remained below \n30%. However, recent developments have set the stage for natural gas to play a more important \nrole. First, Indonesia has become a net oil importer. Second, the oil subsidy reductions in March \nand  October  2005  have  made  natural  gas  prices  more  competitive.  Third,  the  legal  and \nregulatory framework for gas exploration and production has been strengthened. As a result, \nprivate investors are poised to develop large new gas fields, and the national electric utility, PT \nPLN Persero, is keen to increase the share of natural gas in its generation mix. The main \nmarket for energy is in Java, which has fewer gas reserves than Kalimantan, Irian Jaya, and \nSumatra, and is dependent on natural gas from these islands. Major pipeline projects/LNG \nterminals are therefore needed to bring natural gas to the Java market.  \n \n9.  The outlook for the oil and gas industry will depend on the Government\u2019s policies and \nactions.  These  include  (i)  elimination  of  energy  subsidies,  (ii)  incentives  to  encourage \n ", "  3    \nexploration and production in difficult areas, (iii) clear regulations and their implementation \nwithout prejudice, and (iv) promotion of the efficient use of natural gas as a domestic fuel and \nthe export any surplus oil.  \n \n2.  Sector Regulation \n10.  In November 2001, a new oil and gas law was passed.2 It recognizes the importance of \na certain and transparent legal environment in which to conduct business and contemplates the \nestablishment of separate regulators for the upstream and downstream sectors, thus ending \nPERTAMINA\u2019s supervisory role for the upstream sector. The law also removed PERTAMINA\u2019s \ndownstream monopoly, requires transmission and distribution pipelines to be regulated, and \nrequires that third parties have open access to excess pipeline capacity. \n \n11.  To  execute  the  new  oil  and  gas  law,  the  Government  has  prepared  a  series  of \nimplementing regulations3 and established regulatory bodies. BP Migas, a nonprofit state-owned \nlegal entity, was established as the contracting authority for the upstream part of the sector. In \nthis role BP Migas has replaced PERTAMINA in existing production sharing contracts and will \nenter into cooperation contracts with entities undertaking exploration and exploitation of oil and \ngas in Indonesia. The downstream regulatory body-cum-contracting agency, BPH Migas, is \nauthorized to determine and regulate rates for natural gas transmission and distribution through \npipelines,  to  determine  and  regulate  prices  to  residential  and  small-scale  commercial \nconsumers, to resolve disputes among participants in natural gas transportation activities and to \ngrant access and tender rights to participate in the natural gas master plan. Gas prices charged \nto  industrial  and  other  customers  not  classified  as  small  will  remain  unregulated  and  will \ncontinue to be determined bilaterally between the customer and the provider of gas. \n   \n12.  The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources has prepared and will update a natural \ngas  master  plan.  The  master  plan  is  intended  to  focus  on  tendering,  development,  and \nconstruction of new projects to develop the national gas transportation network. Before the \ndevelopment of the master plan, licenses to develop some projects had already been granted, \nand for such projects existing licenses remain valid. PGN has already been granted a license for \nphases I and II of the South Sumatra to West Java gas pipeline project.  \n \nB.  ADB\u2019s Operations \n1.  ADB\u2019s Country Strategy for Indonesia \n13.  ADB\u2019s new country strategy for Indonesia, currently under preparation, states that ADB \nwill be guided by the Government\u2019s five priority areas to achieve sustainable economic growth, \nwhich is needed to absorb the large number of new entrants to the labor market and to reduce \npoverty. The five priority areas are (i) job creation and poverty reduction; (ii) macroeconomic \nstability; (iii) increase of investments, exports, and tourism; (iv) improved access to and quality \nof education and health; and (v) infrastructure development by improving the efficiency of \nexisting services and increasing private sector participation. To support the Government\u2019s goal \nand drawing on lessons learned, ADB will focus on (i) development of infrastructure, (ii) financial \nsector deepening, (iii) decentralization, (iv) millennium development goal acceleration, and (v) \n                                                 \n2  Law of the Republic of Indonesia (Number 22 of 2001) Concerning Natural Oil and Gas. \n3  The  Government  Regulations  on  Implementing  Agency  (BP  Migas),  Regulatory  Agency  (BPH  Migas), \nCorporatization of PERTAMINA, Upstream Businesses, Downstream Businesses, and Appointment of the Head of \nImplementing Agency, as well as the Presidential Decree on the Establishment of Regulatory Agency, issued in \n2002\u20132004.  \n \n ", "4     \nenvironment and natural resource management. This Project is in line with ADB\u2019s focus on \npoints (i) and (v).  \n \n14.  ADB is proposing a major contribution to the development of infrastructure through the \ninfrastructure reform program (IRP), currently being processed. The IRP is proposed as a \nprogram cluster comprising three sub-programs, to be implemented from 2006 to 2009. The \nobjective  of  the  IRP  is  to  strengthen  the  investment  climate  to  accelerate  infrastructure \ndevelopment through private sector participation and additional public sector resources.4 The \npolicy  framework  for  the  IRP  is  based  on  ongoing  reforms  (for  sub-program  1)  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s own medium-term reform agenda, with the actions for sub-programs 2 and 3 \ndefined in an indicative manner. The policy framework for the IRP includes an assessment of \npossible further reforms of the oil and gas sector regulatory framework. \n \n2.  ADB\u2019s Energy Sector Strategy for Indonesia \n15.  ADB\u2019s energy sector strategy supports, as operational priorities, (i) poverty reduction, \nincluding by creating energy infrastructure for sustainable economic growth; (ii) promotion of \nprivate  sector  involvement  by  restructuring  the  energy  sector,  and  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment for the private sector; (iii) addressing regional and global environment impacts by \nsupporting measures to address acid rain problems and use of clean energy; and (iv) promotion \nof regional cooperation. This Project assists points (i) through (iii) of this strategy.  \n \n16.  ADB has played a significant role in the development of gas transmission infrastructure \nin Indonesia and in developing the country\u2019s regulatory capacity for the oil and gas sector. \nADB\u2019s Loan 1357-INO5 supported the construction of the trans-Sumatra gas pipeline that not \nonly enhanced domestic use of natural gas but also established an important segment of the \ntrans-ASEAN gas grid promoting regional energy cooperation. An important policy covenant \nunder the loan required the conversion of PGN from a state corporation to a limited liability \ncompany and this conversion was completed in 1996. ADB also conducted extensive and high-\nlevel policy dialogue on the participation of the private sector and, as a result, PGN created a \nsubsidiary with a 40% private sector participation to own and operate the transmission system \ncomprising the Grissik\u2013Duri line completed in 1998, the Grissik\u2013Sakernan\u2013Batam\u2013Singapore \npipelines completed in 2004 and the Batam distribution network completed in 2005. ADB has \nprovided  several  technical  assistance  (TA)  projects6 to  support  the  establishment  of  the \nregulatory framework and restructuring of the gas sector, development of the gas sector master \nplan, and for gas distribution and use. An ongoing TA supports the development of the least-\ncost option for gas supply to meet growing energy demand in Java.7 \n \n                                                 \n4 The sector coverage of IRP includes: transportation (roads, ports, airports, and railways); power; oil and gas; \ntelecommunication; and water supply and sanitation. \n5  ADB. 1995.

ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations in Indonesia \n17.  ADB commenced private sector operations in Indonesia in 1985. Before 2005, ADB had \napproved  financial  assistance  for  16  projects  in  the  general  industry  and  financial  sectors \ntotaling  $197.5  million.  The  performance  of  some  of  these  projects,  particularly  in  the \nmanufacturing sector, was less than satisfactory, primarily because of issues of sector and \npartner selection. The private sector portfolio was badly affected by the Asian financial crisis. \nBecause of concerns surrounding concession awards, infrastructure projects have rarely been \nconsidered  by  ADB.  However,  recently  there  have  been  significant  changes  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s  attitude  towards  business,  with  increasing  support  for  transparency  and \ngovernance. To support the Government in its efforts, ADB proposes to revitalize its private \nsector operations to catalyze the return of private sector investments in infrastructure, especially \nin the energy and transport sectors. This process began with the approval in December 2005 of \na $350 million loan to the Tangguh LNG project,8 and this Project is seen as a continuation of \nthis process in line with the strategy.  \n \nIV.  THE BORROWER \nA.  Background \n18.  Background information on PGN is in Appendix 3. PGN is an Indonesian gas utility \ninvolved in the transmission, distribution, wholesaling, and retailing of natural gas. PGN owns \nand operates four transmission pipelines totaling 1,074 km and seven distribution networks \nserving eight cities and consisting of 3,172 km of pipelines. The company\u2019s main business is \nselling  natural  gas  to  industrial  customers,  and  PGN  is  the  dominant  gas  distributor  in \nIndonesia, accounting for more than 90% of gas sales by volume. Gas distribution accounted for \n79% of PGN\u2019s revenues in 2005. PGN also receives revenue from its transmission assets by \ncharging a toll fee for transportation services and this business contributed 21% of revenues \nduring the same period. Following its IPO in December 2003 PGN is listed on the Jakarta and \nSurabaya stock exchanges. PGN is 61% owned by the Government. \n \n19.  In calendar year 2005 PGN\u2019s distribution business had gas sales volume of 303 mmscfd. \nPGN sells gas primarily to industrial customers in eight urban markets9 and over the next few \nyears the company plans to open gas distribution networks in four new urban markets.10 PGN \nestimates that its current core customer base of 670 industrial clients requires a further 500 \nmmscfd of gas supply and that there are another 180 potential customers with a total potential \ndemand of 450 mmscfd. As of 1 June 2006, PGN had entered into preliminary agreements for \ngas sales with 309 of these potential customers.  \n \n20.  PGN\u2019s  transmission  network  comprises  (i)  the  Grissik\u2013Duri  transmission  pipeline  in \nSumatra through which ConocoPhillips ships gas to Caltex under a long-term gas transportation \nagreement; (ii) the Grissik\u2013Singapore transmission pipeline through which PERTAMINA ships \ngas to PowerGas of Singapore, also under a long-term gas transportation agreement, both of \nwhich are owned and operated through PGN\u2019s 59.75%-owned subsidiary, Transgasindo; and \n(iii) two small transmission operations in Medan and Jakarta used by PERTAMINA to supply \ngas to power stations and CNG filling stations. The Grissik\u2013Duri, Grissik\u2013Singapore and Medan \ntransmission systems consist of 1074 km of pipelines with a combined capacity of 807 mmscfd, \nwhile  the  Jakarta  transmission  system  uses  the  existing  distribution  pipelines.  PGN\u2019s \n                                                 \n8  The loan to the Tangguh LNG project was ADB\u2019s first PSOD loan to Indonesia since 1994 and is also the largest \nsingle tranche loan by PSOD to date. \n9  Jakarta, Surabaya, Medan, Bogor, Cirebon, Palembang, Batam Island, and Pekanbaru \n10 Semarang, Banten, Lampung, and Jambi. \n ", "6     \ntransmission network transported an average of 676 mmscfd of natural gas in the first quarter of \n2006. \n \n21.  PGN has begun building two pipelines between South Sumatra and West Java, phases I \nand II of the South Sumatra to West Java gas pipeline project, and has received approval for \nthe construction of a 509 km transmission pipeline from Duri to Medan. PGN also intends to \ntender for the right to develop other gas transmission pipeline projects, which are put out to \npublic tender by BPH Migas as part of the Government\u2019s master plan to develop Indonesia\u2019s \nintegrated gas transmission and distribution network.  \n \nB.  Corporate Governance \n22.  PGN\u2019s management team comprises a five-member board of directors (BOD) whose \nactivities are monitored by a six-member board of commissioners (BOC). All current members \nof PGN\u2019s BOD and BOC have extensive experience in the Indonesian oil and gas industry. \nMembers of PGN\u2019s BOD have long records of service with the company, ranging from 12 to 23 \nyears. Members of PGN\u2019s BOC come from a variety of backgrounds, including the Ministry of \nEnergy  and  Mineral  Resources,  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  PERTAMINA,  and  the  National \nDevelopment Planning Agency (Bapenas). \n \n23.  In December 2003, PGN listed its shares on the Jakarta and Surabaya stock exchanges \nin  an  IPO  that  reduced  the  Government\u2019s  shareholding  in  PGN  to  61%.11 Although  the \nGovernment retains a special share and has the power to direct PGN activities, it has allowed \nthe company to operate as an independent, commercial entity. PGN\u2019s listing has subjected it to \ncompany law and other laws that apply to private sector companies. Listing has also meant that \nPGN\u2019s  commercial  performance  is  subject  to  monitoring  by  shareholders  other  than  the \nGovernment. The significant rise in PGN\u2019s share price since the IPO, from the listing price of \nRp1,500 to Rp12,600 on 1 June 2006, may be seen as a reflection of market confidence and is \nto a large extent supported by PGN\u2019s reputation for good corporate governance. PGN was \nawarded the top performing listed company 2006 by Investor, a local business magazine, in \nApril 2006.  \n \n24.  Following  its  listing  PGN  complies  with  the  Jakarta  Stock  Exchange  requirements \nregarding  financial  reporting,  which  stipulate  that  PGN  must  submit  its  (i)  audited  annual \nfinancial statements for the year ending December 31 by June 30 of the following year, and (ii) \nunaudited interim financial results for the first 6 months of the financial year by 31 August the \nsame  year.  PGN\u2019s  auditors  are  appointed  at  a  shareholders\u2019  meeting  each  year  and  are \nrequired to be one of the private audit firms licensed by the Ministry of Finance and accredited \nby  the  Indonesian  Capital  Markets  Supervisory  Agency  (Bapepam).  As  a  publicly  listed \ncompany, PGN is also subject to the Bapepam requirements regarding independent board \nmembers and an independent audit committee, which is not to be chaired by the chair of the \nboard. PGN has two independent commissioners on its BOC whose task is to monitor the \noperations of the business on behalf of public investors. PGN has also formed an independent \naudit committee, chaired by one of the independent commissioners, which is responsible for \nreporting to the BOC on the financial condition of the company and business management and \nfor increasing the effectiveness of internal and external audit functions. \n                                                 \n11  ADB  has  been  involved  in  corporate  governance  and  privatization  reforms  through  the  SOE \nGovernance and Privatization Program between 1998 and 2005. As part of this program, PGN has \nprepared Statements of Corporate Intent outlining its corporate vision and operational plans on an \nannual basis. The Government has also included further privatization of PGN in its annual plans since \n2004. However, Parliamentary approval has not been obtained to date. \n ", "  7    \n25.  PGN received an ISO 9001:2000 certificate from Lloyd\u2019s Register Quality Assurance in \n2003,  and  in  2005  PGN  recommitted  itself  to  implementing  good  corporate  governance \nprinciples of transparency, independence, accountability and fairness. As part of its corporate \ngovernance policy PGN requires its staff to adhere to its standard operating procedures for \nsafety  in  emergency  situations  for  transmission  and  distribution  pipelines;  operation  and \nmaintenance  of  distribution  pipelines;  and  pipeline  design  standards,  which  have  all  been \ndeveloped following international codes of practice. \n \nC.  Financial Performance \n26.  A review of financial information on PGN is included in Appendix 4 and key financial \ninformation is summarized in Table 2. PGN is rated by the international credit rating agencies \nMoody\u2019s and Standard & Poor\u2019s. On 19 May 2006 PGN\u2019s foreign currency debt rating was \nupgraded from B1 to Ba3 by Moody\u2019s. PGN is therefore rated higher than the Indonesian \nsovereign rating of B1 by Moody\u2019s. Both PGN and the Indonesian sovereign are rated B+ by \nStandard and Poor\u2019s.  \n \nTable 2: Summary of PGN Financial Performance 2003-2005 \n(Rp billion) \n \n     \nItem  2003  2004  2005 \n       \nRevenue            3,596            4,458               5,434  \n  Transmission               627               849              1,153 \n  Distribution            2,969            3,609              4,280 \nEBITDA            1,278            1,460               2,204  \nPretax Profit               740               683               1,364  \nNet Profit               510               474                  862  \nCash and Equivalents             1,927            3,347              3,972 \nTotal Assets            9,127          11,040             12,575  \nTotal Debt            4,329           6,174              6,383 \nTotal Liabilities            5,865            7,862               8,376 \nShareholders' Equity            3,262            3,178               4,198  \nCurrent Ratio (Current Assets Divided \nby Current Liabilities)   4.01   3.76    3.59 \nEBITDA Margin (%)                35.5                32.8                   40.6 \nNet Margin (%)                14.2                10.6                   15.9 \nDebt to Equity (Debt Percentage) (%)                57                66                   60 \nDebt Service Coverage Ratio \u2013 \nEBITDA Divided by Total Debt Service \n(times)  3.32  2.95   3.74 \nDebt Divided by EBITDA  3.39  4.23   2.90\n \nEBITDA = earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization  \nSource: PGN Consolidated Financial Statements with Independent Auditors\u2019 Report 2003\u20132005. \n \n27.  In 2005, PGN generated total revenues of Rp5.4 trillion (equivalent to $584 million), 79% \nfrom  distribution  and  21%  from  transmission.  Pre-tax  income  in  2005  was  Rp1.4  trillion \n(equivalent to $147 million), which represented a 100% increase compared with the prior year. \nPGN had strong cash flow from operating activities of Rp1.6 trillion (equivalent to $172 million) \nin 2005. EBITDA for the year was Rp2.2 trillion (equivalent to $237 million) and with total debt \n ", "8     \nservice amounting to Rp589 billion (equivalent to $63 million) the debt service coverage ratio \nwas a comfortable 3.74x. The company\u2019s unrestricted cash position remained healthy at the end \nof 2005 at Rp4 trillion (equivalent to $427 million). PGN\u2019s total borrowings as at 31 December \n2005 were Rp6.4 trillion (equivalent to $686 million), including loans owed to the Government of \nRp2.9 trillion (equivalent to $315 million) and amounts due under the two Eurobond issues \ntotaling Rp2.6 trillion (equivalent to $282 million). The loans due to Government were funded by \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation, European Investment Bank, World Bank and ADB. \nThe Eurobonds, which were issued in 2003 and 2004, have a 10-year final maturity with a put \noption after 7 years and are unsecured. An analysis of PGN\u2019s borrowings as at 31 December \n2005 shows that (i) most of the borrowings were long-term (only 5.3% of total debts were \nrepayable within 12 months) and (ii) the company\u2019s total debt\u2013equity ratio was 60:40, which is \ncomfortably inside the level covenanted to ADB under the existing loan agreement of 70:30. \nPGN\u2019s total equity at the end of 2005 was Rp4.2 trillion (equivalent to $451 million). As of 1 June \n2006, the company\u2019s stock market capitalization was Rp57 trillion (equivalent to $6.1 billion). \n \nD.  Special Features \n1.  SOE Lending under IEI Pilot Financing Instruments \n \n28.  As outlined in ADB\u2019s Innovation and Efficiency Initiative: Pilot Financing Instruments and \nModalities paper12, there are numerous SOEs that are creditworthy and have the long-term \nfinancial viability to borrow without government guarantees. They constitute a \u201cthird generation\u201d \nof potential clients, increasingly important as borrowers separate from the sovereign. These \nentities play an important role in creating jobs and providing infrastructure and basic public \nservices. Giving them access to affordable long-term credit is critical to promoting economic \ngrowth. Starting in 2003, PGN has borrowed from the international debt capital markets without \nGovernment  assistance.  ADB\u2019s  objective  in  processing  this  transaction  is  to  lend,  and  to \nfacilitate further lending through cofinancing, in each case without government guarantee to \nPGN so as to ensure that environmentally friendly indigenous energy can be delivered to West \nJava on an economic basis.  \n \n2.  Supporting the Sector Reform Program \n29.  As indicated in the IEI Board paper, ADB lending to SOEs should be accompanied by \ncorporate/sector  reforms.  ADB  has  played  a  significant  role  in  developing  the  regulatory \ncapacity for the oil and gas sector and the Government is now fundamentally reforming the \nsector pursuant to the new oil and gas law. In particular, the Government has initiated the \nunbundling of the sector into its upstream and downstream components and has mandated a \nclear separation of the regulatory function from business entities. New regulators have been \nestablished for the upstream and downstream subsectors, and competition has been introduced \nby, for example, calling for tenders for the development and construction of pipelines that form \npart of the natural gas master plan developed by BPH Migas and by removing PERTAMINA\u2019s \ndownstream monopoly. To complement its various sector reforms the Government has asked \nthat  ADB  consider  increasing  its  non-sovereign  guaranteed  lending  to  eligible  borrowers \nespecially in the infrastructure sector and the proposed loan to PGN is responsive to this \nrequest.  \n \n                                                 \n12  ADB. 2005. Innovation and Efficiency Initiative: Pilot Financing Instruments and Modalities. Manila \n ", "  9    \n3.  Supporting PGN\u2019s development \n30.  As noted above, PGN is a long-standing borrower from ADB and an important policy \ncovenant under ADB\u2019s previous loan required the conversion of PGN from a state corporation to \na limited liability company. This conversion was completed in 1996. In addition, PGN has \nundertaken numerous corporate governance reforms to improve performance, transparency, \nand efficiency, leading to its partial privatization via IPO in late 2003. PGN is now 61%-owned \nby the Government. Subsequent to its IPO, PGN has issued debt in the international debt \ncapital  markets  with  a  10-year  maturity  on  an  unsecured  basis  and  without  government \nguarantee. As a publicly listed company with debt ratings from the international credit rating \nagencies PGN is now subject to substantial scrutiny and market discipline and can be regarded \nas having successfully graduated from being an SOE to being a company that is governed and \nmanaged with a high degree of autonomy and which operates on a fully commercial basis. It is \nanticipated  that  any  future  ADB  support  to  PGN  will  be  provided  without  a  Government \nguarantee, either on a corporate or on a project finance basis. PGN is seen as a governance \nmodel  for  SOEs  and  may  be  regarded  as  a  successful  model  for  the  reform  and \ncommercialization of SOEs.  \n \nV.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Description \n31.  The Project consists of the construction of 661 km of gas pipeline for the transportation \nof natural gas from major gas fields in South Sumatra to the major gas-consuming markets of \nWest Java. The pipeline will be constructed in four linked sections between Grissik in South \nSumatra and Rawa Maju in West Java. Section 1 of the pipeline will comprise 196 km of 36-\ninch-diameter pipeline running from the Corridor Block gas field operated by ConocoPhillips at \nGrissik in South Sumatra to Pagardewa, also in South Sumatra. Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the \npipeline will comprise linked 32-inch-diameter pipelines running (i) 270 km from Pagardewa to \nthe coast of South Sumatra at Labuhan Maringgai; (ii) 161 km offshore beneath the Java Sea \nfrom Labuhan Maringgai to the coast of West Java at Muara Bekasi, and (iii) 34 km from Muara \nBekasi to Rawa Maju in West Java. Section 2 of the Project will follow the same alignment \nbetween Pagardewa and Labuhan Maringgai as the South Sumatra to West Java phase I gas \npipeline project under construction by PGN using official development aid funding provided by \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC).  \n \n32.  The Project is the second component of an overall PGN transmission pipeline system \nexpansion designed to address a shortage of natural gas in West Java through the linkage of \ngas supply sources in South Sumatra with West Java. The Project has been designed with the \ncapacity to transport 460 million standard cubic feet per day (mmscfd) of natural gas from the \nCorridor Block operated by ConocoPhillips. Gas users will be primarily industrial customers \nlocated in West Java. The construction of the Project will make available much-needed gas \nsupply for PGN\u2019s West Java distribution business, which in recent years has been operating \nsubstantially below capacity because of insufficient supplies of gas. \n \n33.  In parallel with the implementation of the Project, PGN is investing in its West Java gas \ndistribution network  in  Greater  Jakarta  and  the  Banten  area  (funded  by  World  Bank),  the \nCilegon area (funded by JBIC) and in the Rawa Maju area (funded from internal resources). \nFrom 2005 to 2008, PGN plans to invest over $200 million in its West Java gas distribution \nnetwork. \n \n ", "10    \nB.  Key Implementation Arrangements  \n1.  Design and Land Acquisition \n34.  The pipeline design has been completed. The design of the pipeline as well as its \nsupporting facilities has been carried out in accordance with international as well as national \nstandards.13 The  pipeline  will  be  coated  externally  for  corrosion  prevention  and  has  been \ndesigned for an operational period of at least 20 years. With respect to project design, the \nlenders\u2019 technical consultant14 has concluded that the pipeline facilities in the Project are typical \nof that expected in projects of this nature. As of May 2006, PGN had acquired about 85% of \nland for the pipeline corridor and PGN expects to complete the land acquisition by October \n2006. \n \n2.  Contracting Strategy and Costs \n35.  An overview of the construction contracts awarded for construction of the Project is in \nAppendix 5. For the purposes of construction, the Project has been divided into 17 contract \npackages, all of which have been awarded on a fixed-price basis. PGN has advised that there \nhave been no variation orders issued under any of the contracts and that the company expects \nthe Project to be completed within the original budget and that the physical contingency will not \nbe used.  \n \n3.  Procurement \n36.  The lenders\u2019 technical consultant has reviewed the procurement arrangements for the \nProject and has concluded that PGN has used a well-established transparent and competitive \ntendering process. In particular, to ensure transparency the tender opening process is a public \nevent and PGN allows unsuccessful bidders to lodge objections.  \n \n4.  Construction Progress and Schedule \n37.  As of the end of April 2006, construction of the Project was 42% complete and PGN was \nworking toward the following milestone dates for the Project: (i) 1 November 2006: gas turn on \nfrom PERTAMINA at the receiving station at Pagardewa, South Sumatra, and delivery to Rawa \nMaju in West Java; and (ii) 1 February 2007: completion of the Grissik\u2013Pagardewa section and \nconnection with the ConocoPhillips gas supply. As of May 2006, the onshore construction \ncontractor for the Pagardewa to Labuhan Maringgai section of the Project was about 5 weeks \nbehind schedule because of inclement weather in early 2006. The contractor has submitted a \nrecovery plan which would allow completion to occur by 1 November 2006, and the lenders\u2019 \ntechnical consultant has advised that this plan is ambitious but may be achievable under ideal \nweather conditions. PGN receives monthly progress reports on construction progress from its \ncontractors and the lenders will discuss with PGN the possibility of these being made available \nto lenders.  \n                                                 \n13  International standards refer to the (i) American Petroleum Institute, (ii) American Society for Testing Material, (iii) \nAmerican Standard for Mechanical Engineering (ASME) (ASME B-31.8 Gas Transmission and Distribution Piping \nSystems, ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code), and (iv) Det Norske Veritas (DNV-OS-F101 and DNV 2000 \n[Submarine Pipeline Systems]). National standards refer to SNI (Standar Nasional Indonesia or National Standard \nof Indonesia) 13-3474-2002 and Decree of the Minister for Mining and Energy of the Republic of Indonesia no. \n300.K/38/MPE/1997 on Safety for Natural Gas Transmission Pipeline. \n14  As part of the due diligence process, ADB and ING appointed a consortium led by Schlumberger Business \nConsulting and including JP Kenny, ERM and other divisions of Schlumberger to conduct a review of PGN that \nencompassed market, commercial, supply, regulatory, design, construction, environmental, health and safety, and \nsocial and stakeholder issues. \n ", "  11    \n5.  Construction Management and Operations \n38.  PGN  is  responsible  for  overall  management  of  the  Project,  including  construction \nmanagement and operation and maintenance of the pipeline. For the construction phase, PGN \nhas awarded two construction management contracts, one for the onshore portion of the works \nand one for the offshore portion. For the operations phase, PGN will create an operation and \nmaintenance  team  comprising  staff  members  selected  from  Transgasindo,  who  have \nexperience of operating PGN\u2019s existing Grissik\u2013Singpore and Batam\u2013Grissik\u2013Duri pipelines. \nPGN\u2019s  pipeline  operations  and  maintenance  procedures  are  designed  to  international \nstandards.15 The lenders\u2019 technical consultant has concluded that PGN\u2019s existing operation and \nmaintenance procedures are comprehensive and practical.  \n \n6.  Gas Supply Agreements \n39.  PGN has signed two anchor gas supply contracts for gas supply from South Sumatra to \nWest Java. The first was signed in June 2003 with PERTAMINA for the supply of at least 1 tcf of \ngas over 12 years. Gas deliveries are scheduled begin in the last quarter 2006 at a rate of 150 \nmmscfd, will reach a plateau of 250 mmscfd from 2008 to 2017, and thereafter will be subject to \nactual availability and deliverability of the field. The second major agreement for the supply of \ngas from South Sumatra was signed in August 2004 with ConocoPhillips and is for the supply of \n2.3 tcf of gas over 17 years. Gas deliveries will begin in the first quarter 2007 at a rate of 175 \nmmscfd and will rise to 412 mmscfd from 2012 until contract termination in 2023. The gas \npurchase price under the contract is fixed for the full tenor of the contract.  \n \n7.  Gas Sales Arrangements \n40.  Industrial  customers  accounted  for  98%  of  PGN\u2019s  sales  in  2005.  PGN\u2019s  industrial \ncustomers typically sign 3-year gas purchase contracts. Key industrial sectors include glass and \nceramics, chemicals, and paper, which together accounted for 62% of total gas sales in 2005. \nThe typical profile of PGN\u2019s largest customers are domestic export-oriented manufacturers and \nIndonesian subsidiaries of international companies. Given current oil prices, there is substantial \nfinancial benefit to consumers in switching to gas from oil-based fuels. The lenders\u2019 technical \nconsultant  has  concluded  that  there  is  likely  to  be  sufficient  demand  for  all  of  the  gas \ntransported by the Project and that PGN\u2019s sales volumes are more likely to be constrained by \nthe availability of gas supplies than by a shortfall in demand by end users.  \n \nC.  Environmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n1.  Environment \n41.  The Project has been classified under environmental category B. A summary of the \ninitial environmental examination for the Project is included as Appendix 6. The proposed 466 \nkm Project pipeline corridor in South Sumatra traverses through agricultural land, degraded and \nfragmented forests, rural settlements, and roads. The terrain is mostly low-lying plains. The 34 \nkm pipeline corridor between Muara Bekasi and Rawa Maju in West Java passes through \nterrain similar to that of South Sumatra. The mangrove on the coast around Labuhan Maringgai \nand  Muara  Bekasi  is  either  fragmented  or  used  for  fishponds,  which  is  no  longer \nenvironmentally sensitive. Despite the fact that the Project will not pass through environmentally \nsensitive areas, PGN is committed to rehabilitate and improve the ecosystem in an area of 1 ha \nof lost mangrove habitat at the coastlines at Labuhan Maringgai and Muara Bekasi, the two \n                                                 \n15  ASME B-31.8 - Gas Transmission and Distribution Piping Systems. \n ", "12    \npoints where the pipeline meets the sea.16 The offshore pipeline alignment avoids the coral \nreefs around the Seribu Islands. The sea around Labuhan Maringgai and Muara Bekasi has no \ncoral reef or marine mammals of ecological importance.  \n \n42.  During  construction,  the  Project  will  create  transient  disturbances  to  environmental \nquality. However, the disturbances common to all civil work construction would not create \nsignificant impacts considering the short construction period over a section of the corridor before \nthe construction progresses to other sections of the narrow construction area. The construction \nwill not have significant impacts on wildlife and forest. The corridor will be covered with grass \nand shallow-root vegetation to minimize soil erosion. During operation, the pipeline will not \npollute the environment as it does not generate wastes. The only issues of note will be noise \nand  safety.  To  ensure  system  performance  and  integrity,  a  supervisory  control  and  data \nacquisition system will be installed to manage the operations of the pipeline, including leak \ndetection. An information-sharing and education program for communities near the onshore \npipeline routes will also be developed to prepare the communities for emergency response and \nevacuation in the event of accidents.  \n \n43.  PGN  has  prepared  an  environmental  management  plan,  which  contains  mitigation \nmeasures for all identified major impacts, and monitoring activities to be carried out during \nconstruction  and  operation.  PGN  has  incorporated  within  each  construction  contract \nenvironmental management requirements to be complied with by the contractors.  \n \n44.  The Project will create environmental benefits by replacing more polluting fuels such as \nhigh speed diesel and coal, with natural gas. Based on the estimates of natural gas use, the net \npresent  value  of  the  environmental  benefits  is  estimated  at  about  $74.52  million  for  the \noperating life of 20 years and a discount rate of 8% per annum.  \n \n45.  All  environmental  plans  relating  to  the  Project  have  been  scrutinized  by  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental specialists and the lenders\u2019 technical consultant and have been found to be \nsatisfactory.  \n \n2.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement, Indigenous Peoples    \n46.  The Project has been classified under involuntary resettlement category A and a full land \nacquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) has been prepared. A summary of the LARP is \nincluded as Appendix 7. The onshore pipeline alignment was selected because it minimizes the \nnumber of structures and persons affected. In South Sumatra and Lampung provinces, PGN is \nacquiring 1,137.76 ha of land for the Project including 951.42 ha of privately owned land. In all, \n4,791  land  parcels  belonging  to  4,315  users  (both  legal  owners  and  non-titled  users)  are \naffected. The land acquired is mainly agricultural land such as rice fields, traditional plantations, \ndrylands, and arable homesteads. A total of 28 structures in South Sumatra and 12 in Lampung \nwith an average area of 50.5 m2 are also affected. The structures affected are semi-permanent \nwooden houses, huts, and farm field shelters. No community structures and common property \nresources nor social facility structures are directly affected by the Project. Since all affected \npersons in South Sumatra and Lampung have opted for cash compensation, no resettlement is \nrequired. Land used for the Project in West Java will be leased from Perum Jasa Tirta II and \nruns adjacent to an existing drainage canal. No structures or persons in West Java are affected \nby the Project. The land acquisition and resettlement arrangements for the Project have been \n                                                 \n16 In  its  Grissik  to  Singapore  via  Batam  island  transmission  and  distribution  project  (Loan-1357-INO),  PGN \nrehabilitated mangroves at its Panaran station on Batam island, involving a local community and the surrounding \nlocal community in replanting and monitoring growth of the mangrove trees there. \n ", "  13    \nreviewed and have been found to be acceptable, subject to certain requirements set out in \nparagraph 47  \n \n47.  PGN  will  be  required  to  (i)  ensure  that  the  resettlement  plan  is  implemented  in \naccordance  with  ADB's  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement;17 (ii)  submit  updated  and  final \ninformation on the number and different categories of affected persons; (iii) ensure that internal \nand external monitoring reports on resettlement are submitted to ADB; (iv) provide a report \nimmediately  following  completion  of  implementation  of  the  LARP;  (v)  appoint  an  external \nconsultant to carry out an updated socioeconomic survey and to review and report to ADB on \nimplementation of the LARP; and (vi) if outstanding resettlement issues are identified, prepare \nand submit to ADB a comprehensive plan to address such issues with supporting budget. \n \n48.  Due diligence has confirmed that the project area will not pass through any communities \nof indigenous people.  \n \nD.  Development Impact \n49.  The Project supports the Government\u2019s objective of achieving sustainable economic \ngrowth to reduce poverty through infrastructure development with private sector participation. \nThe Project will increase the supply of economic and clean energy to West Java, which includes \nthe third largest concentration of poor in Indonesia, and thereby support economic growth and \nhelp reduce air pollution. The Project will also decrease imports of oil and petroleum products \nthereby increasing energy self-sufficiency and insulating energy consumers from any sharp \nincrease in fuel prices that would result from future subsidy reductions. The proposed ADB \nassistance will also further the aim of graduating PGN from a Government-guaranteed borrower \nto  a  stand-alone  borrower  and  will  support  PGN  as  a  model  of  SOE  reform  and \ncommercialization in Indonesia.  \n \nE.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n50.  The Project\u2019s total investment cost is estimated at $652.5 million, which includes the cost \nof land acquisition, the cost of the 17 fixed-price contract packages that have been awarded, \nand an allowance for physical contingencies.

PGN has requested a loan of up to $75 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to \nhelp finance the Project. The loan will have a 15-year term including a grace period of 3 years. \nIn addition, ADB has been asked to provide two complementary loans: (i) up to $75 million to be \nfunded by one or more international commercial banks under ADB\u2019s CFS, and (ii) up to $50 \nmillion to be funded by KfW under ADB\u2019s CFS.  \n \n ", "  15    \n53.  In its role as lead arranger of the financing for PGN, ADB has introduced the Project to \nthe Islamic Development Bank (IDB), which is expected to provide a direct loan to PGN of up to \n$75  million  with  a  term  of  up  to  15  years.  The  balance  of  the  funding  required  for  the \nimplementation of the Project will come from PGN\u2019s own resources, which include proceeds of \nthe company\u2019s IPO in December 2003, two bond issues carried out in 2003 and 2004 and cash \nflow generated from operations. As of 31 December 2005, PGN had cash and cash equivalents \n(including restricted cash) of Rp4.15 trillion (equivalent to $445 million) and therefore is in a \nposition to fund its portion of the Project cost with relative ease. \n \n \nVI.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  ADB Loans \n1.  Nature and Amount \n54.  The proposed ADB assistance to PGN will comprise three loans: \n \n(i)  A direct loan of up to $75 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with an \namortization  period  of  15  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  and \nsemiannual repayments. Interest will be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility  and  PGN  will \nconsider the option of either a floating or a fixed interest rate. Front-end fees, \ncommitment fees, and the interest margin will be determined by ADB\u2019s Interest \nRate Committee; \n(ii)  A  complementary  loan  of  up  to  $75  million  to  be  funded  by  one  or  more \ninternational  commercial  banks  under  ADB\u2019s  CFS,  with  a  term  of  6  years, \nincluding a grace period of 1.5 years, with interest at LIBOR plus an agreed \nmargin. ADB will charge an arrangement fee as a percentage of the CFS loan \nand also an annual administration fee in line with ADB policy; and \n(iii)  A complementary loan of up to $50 million to be funded by KfW under ADB\u2019s \nCFS, with a term of 12 years, including a grace period of 3 years, with interest at \nLIBOR  plus  an  agreed  margin.  ADB  will  charge  an  arrangement  fee  as  a \npercentage of the CFS loan and also an annual administration fee in line with \nADB policy.  \n \n2.  Main Terms and Conditions \n55.  The proposed direct and CFS loans will each be documented in a loan agreement, \nwhich will contain standard terms and conditions that apply to loans to private sector borrowers \nwithout government guarantees and CFS, respectively. ADB will also enter into the following: (i) \na participation agreement with the participating cofinancing banks, and (ii) related and ancillary \ndocumentation. The proposed loans are structured as a corporate finance transaction and since \nPGN has no secured obligations the loans will have recourse to all the assets of PGN. During \nthe tenor of the loan, PGN will be bound by financial and operational covenants as well as \ncovenants related to ADB\u2019s policies pursuant to the ADB loan agreement.18  \n \n                                                 \n18 These covenants include (i) compliance with ADB's environmental and social safeguard policies; (ii) compliance \nwith ADB\u2019s anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, and anti-fraud policies; (iii) the maintenance of adequate debt \nservice coverage ratio and debt to equity ratio; and (iv) negative pledge on PGN's existing assets. \n ", "16    \nB.  Justification for ADB Assistance \n56.  The Project merits ADB\u2019s support for the following reasons: \n \n(i)  The  Project  helps  achieve  the  Government\u2019s  objective  of  increasing  the \nproportion of indigenous natural gas in the domestic energy mix by substituting \nexpensive and polluting oil products with more economic and environmentally \nfriendly natural gas. \n(ii)  The substitution of oil products with natural gas will reduce the requirement for oil \nimports, thus increasing Indonesia\u2019s energy self-reliance. \n(iii)  The Project will reduce the burden of oil subsidies on the national budget when \noil prices are high. \n(iv)  The Project will encourage growth in economic activity in West Java. \n(v)  The financing is responsive to MOF\u2019s request to ADB to lend to PGN without \nsovereign guarantees, thereby furthering the objective of graduating PGN from \nsovereign guaranteed borrowing. \n(vi)  If PGN opts for fixed-rate financing, then the financing will provide PGN access to \nfixed-rate financing over longer tenors than may be available from commercial \nsources. \n(vii)  The financing is consistent with ADB\u2019s policy of supporting mixed (i.e., joint \nprivate  and  public  sector)  enterprises  or  commercially  run  state-owned \nenterprises  with  management  autonomy  and  high  standards  of  corporate \ngovernance under its IEI policy.  \n(viii)  The Project is consistent with the ADB energy policy19 and its promotion of clean \nenergy and also with ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for Indonesia, which \nemphasizes  infrastructure  development,  environment  and  natural  resources \nmanagement, and the encouragement of private sector participation.   \n \nC.  Percentage Investment \n57.  The  proposed  loan,  which  is  ADB\u2019s  first  assistance  to  PGN  without  a  Government \nguarantee since it was partially privatized will, if approved by the Board, represent 4.16% of \nADB\u2019s non-sovereign exposure. ADB\u2019s non-sovereign exposure to Indonesia will be 5.05% of \nADB\u2019s aggregate non-sovereign exposure. ADB\u2019s non-sovereign exposure to transmission and \ndistribution will rise to 7.87% of ADB\u2019s aggregate non-sovereign exposure. \n \nD.  Anticorruption Policy, Combating Money Laundering, and Financing of Terrorism  \n58.  As  a  publicly  listed  company,  PGN  is  subject  to  monitoring  by  Bapepam  and  by \ninstitutional and individual shareholders. PGN must also comply with the financial reporting \nrequirements of the Jakarta Stock Exchange, which require the company\u2019s financial reports to \nbe audited by licensed independent auditors, and is closely monitored by the international credit \nrating agencies in connection with its international public market debt issuance. The lenders\u2019 \ntechnical consultant has reviewed PGN\u2019s procurement processes for the Project and has found \nthat PGN\u2019s procurement processes are well established and transparent. Tenders are well \nadvertised, with appropriate oversight to reduce the risk of collusion. Safeguards are included in \nthe procurement process such as formal prequalification or technical prequalification of bidders. \nPGN also ensures that tender opening is a public event, allows unsuccessful bidders to lodge \nobjections, and will declare a tender void in the case of an insufficient number of bidders. PGN \nhas systems in place to ensure that project-related documents are properly filed and is setting \n                                                 \n19  ADB. 2000.

PGN was advised of ADB\u2019s  anticorruption policy and policy relating to the combating of \nmoney  laundering  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will require PGN to institute, maintain, and \ncomply with internal procedures and controls following international best practice standards for \nthe purpose of preventing corruption or money laundering or the financing of terrorism, and \ncovenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. The loan documentation between \nADB and PGN will further allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these \nundertakings.  \n \nE.  Assurances \n60.  A framework agreement relating to ADB\u2019s status, privileges, and immunities with respect \nto its equity investments and lending operations in the private sector is in effect between the \nGovernment and ADB. Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development \nBank, the Government will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed \nassistance to PGN. No funding will be disbursed until ADB receives such confirmation. In \naddition  no  funding  will  be  disbursed  until  PGN  has  completed  to  ADB\u2019s  satisfaction  the \nrequirements in relation to land acquisition and resettlement set out in paragraph 48 above.  \n \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n61.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove  \n \n(i)  the loan of up to $75,000,000 to PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero) Tbk for \nthe South Sumatra to West Java Phase II Gas Pipeline Project from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a term of 15 years, including a grace period \nof  3  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in this report and as may be reported to the \nBoard;  \n \n(ii)  the complementary loan of up to $75,000,000 to PT Perusahaan Gas Negara \n(Persero) Tbk, to be funded by one or more international commercial banks \nunder ADB\u2019s complementary financing scheme, with a term of 6 years, including \na grace period of 1.5 years, with interest at LIBOR plus an agreed margin, and \non such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those \nset forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board; and \n \n(iii)  the complementary loan of up to $50,000,000 to PT Perusahaan Gas Negara \n(Persero)  Tbk,  to  be  funded  by  KfW  under  ADB\u2019s  complementary  financing \nscheme, with a term of 12 years including a grace period of 3 years, with interest \nat LIBOR plus an agreed margin, and on such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be \nreported to the Board.  \n \n ", "18    \n \nLiqun Jin \nVice President \n \n \n19 July 2006 \n ", "Appendix 1     19 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n     \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets/Indicators  Data Sources/Reporting Mechanisms \n   \n \n     \nImpact     \n     \nThe Indonesian economy  Increased indigenous energy use as a  Statistics/yearbook from: \nis increasingly able to rely  proportion of Indonesia\u2019s energy mix   \non  indigenous  and  Increased use of gas as a proportion of     a.

Indonesia has 45 tertiary sedimentary basins with oil and gas prospects, 15 of which are \nproducing oil and gas, eight that have oil and gas discoveries but are yet to be developed, and \n22 basins which are unexplored. Foreign companies have an active history in the exploration \nand production of oil and gas in Indonesia. However, of late there has been limited new \ninvestment in exploration and production activities.  \n \n2.  The country is well endowed with energy resources and has significant reserves of oil, \nnatural gas and coal. It has 94.7 trillion cubic feet (ft3) of \u201cproven\u201d natural gas reserves (Table \nA2.1), the 13th largest in the world and the largest in Asia and the Pacific. The proven gas \nreserves are three times Indonesia\u2019s oil reserves in energy equivalent terms, and can supply the \ncountry for 35 years at current production rates. If the \u201cpossible\u201d gas reserves are included, \nfuture  supply  could  be  longer  than  50  years.  However,  not  all  of  these  reserves  are \ncommercially viable and not all of their gas is exportable, due to gas quality and distance to \nmarket. \n  \nTable A2.1: Energy Reserves \n(2004) \n \nReserves/ \nEnergy Type    Units  Quantity\nProduction Ratio\n         \nOil    Billion barrels  4.72  11.5 \nGas    Trillion cubic feet  94.7  34.9 \nCoal    Million tonnes  4968  38.0 \n   Anthracite    Million tonnes  740   \n   Sub-bituminous and Lignite  Million tonnes  4228   \n       \n   Source: BP Energy Statistics 2005, Migas. \n \n3.  A majority of Indonesia\u2019s natural gas is produced for the manufacture of LNG, which is \ncurrently exported to Japan, Korea and Taiwan. Due to the decline in natural gas production in \nArun, natural gas and LNG production have declined. However, new LNG projects are under \ndevelopment, including the BP-operated Tangguh LNG project in Irian Jaya, as well as the \nPertamina led Donggi LNG project in Sulawesi. Natural gas is also exported via pipelines to \nSingapore from the Natuna gas fields, and from Sumatra through the Grissik to Singapore \npipeline financed by ADB. \n \n4.  Energy consumption in Indonesia is dominated by oil and gas, which account for 80 \npercent of the total energy (Table 2). Since 2000, the domestic oil production has declined, due \nto natural maturation of producing fields combined with a slower reserve replacement rate. The \nconsumption of oil and oil products has increasing steadily. As a result in 2004, Indonesian oil \nproduction and consumption was just about even, and in 2005 Indonesia became a net importer \nof oil.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  21\n      \nTable A2.2: Share of Different Energy Sources \n(% share) \n \n \nEnergy Source  1990  1995  2000  2001  2002  2003 \n \n     \nCrude Oil and Oil Fuels   60.13 53.36 57.79 53.34 53.35  54.28 \nCoal   5.60 6.53 10.18 13.80 14.32  14.25 \nNatural Gas, LPG, and  29.44 44.62 27.64 27.98 28.05  26.46 \nLNG  \nHydropower   4.38 3.82 3.22 3.48 2.87  3.58 \nGeothermal  0.44 0.61 1.18 1.40 1.40  1.44 \n     \nLNG = liquefied natural gas, LPG = liquid petroleum gas. \nSource: Government of Indonesia. \n \n5.  Although Indonesia is the world\u2019s sixth largest natural gas producer and supplies about a \nquarter of the world\u2019s LNG from its fields in Aceh and Kalimantan, until  recently the abundance \nof cheap oil limited the domestic use of natural gas.  Moreover, lack of clarity regarding the legal \nand regulatory environment and poor incentives in terms of return on investment hampered \nexpansion in current production sharing contracts and new gas field exploration.1 Share of \nnatural gas in the domestic energy mix has remained below 30% due to an inadequate gas \nsupply infrastructure. Several recent developments have set the stage for natural gas playing a \nmuch more important role. First, Indonesia has been on the verge  of becoming a net oil \nimporter. Second, the fuel subsidy reductions in March and October 2005 have made natural \ngas competitive. Third, the legal and regulatory framework has been strengthened. As a result, \nprivate investors are poised to develop new large gas fields, and PLN is keen to substantially \nincrease the share of natural gas in its generation mix. The main market for energy is in the \nisland of Java which has fewer gas reserves than Kalimantan, Irian Jaya, and Sumatra, and is \ndependent on natural gas from these islands. Major pipeline projects and/or LNG terminals \nneed to be implemented to bring natural gas to the Java market.  \n \n6.  Indonesia\u2019s natural gas production reached 73,300 million m3 in 2004, 8th largest in the \nworld and largest in Asia and the Pacific. The country\u2019s gas exports have grown 60-fold from \n661 million m3 in 1977, when LNG exports started, to 39,600 million m3 in 2004. Natural gas is a \nlarge revenue generator for the country. Indonesia\u2019s natural gas exports have traditionally been \nin the form of LNG. Indonesia presently is the largest LNG producer in the world with nearly a \n20% market share. LNG exports are the country\u2019s main energy export, and thus a principle \nsource of revenue. LNG exports averaged 9.5% of the country\u2019s total exports during 1998\u2013\n2004. During the same period, the contribution of LNG to the country\u2019s gross domestic product \naveraged 3.5%. Since 1998 the share of LNG has declined and domestic consumption of \nnatural gas has increased. This rate of growth in consumption is expected to increase further \nwith  the  Government\u2019s  decree  prioritizing  the  domestic  use  of  indigenous  fuels  to  reduce \ndependence on the volatile international oil market. \n \n                                                 \n1  Gas contracts signed before 1971 still account for almost 60% of Indonesia\u2019s commercial reserves, and large gas \nfields have remained unexplored. \n ", "22  Appendix 2   \nF.  Sector Regulations \n7.  As part of a wider program for deregulation, the Government announced reforms in the \noil and gas and in November 2001 a new oil and gas law providing a new framework for the oil \nand gas industry: Law of the Republic of Indonesia (Number 22 of 2001) Concerning Natural Oil \nand Gas (the new oil and gas law) was approved. It recognizes the importance of a certain and \ntransparent legal environment in which to conduct business activities, and contemplates the \nestablishment  of  upstream  and  downstream  environments  with  an  appropriate  regulatory \nframework  for  each.  Though  similar  in  its  philosophy  to  the  annulled  Electricity  Law  No. \n20/2002, the Oil and Gas Law No. 22/2001 was upheld by the Constitutional Court in December \n2005, except for provisions related to domestic market obligation, and oil and gas pricing. The \nConstitutional  Court  ruled  that  a  minimum  allocation  for  the  domestic  market  should  be \nstipulated for oil and gas producers, and that gas prices should be set administratively rather \nthan being determined by competition. \n  \n8.  To  execute  the  new  oil  and  gas  law  the  Government  has  prepared  a  series  of \nimplementing regulations and established regulatory bodies. The upstream regulator, BP Migas \ncontrols upstream activities on behalf of the Government through cooperation contracts with \nentities undertaking exploration and exploitation of oil and gas in Indonesia, and has replaced \nPertamina in the existing production sharing contracts. The downstream regulator, BPH Migas, \nis authorized to determine and regulate rates for gas transmission and distribution through \npipelines, and prices for residential and small-scale commercial consumers. BPH Migas is also \nentrusted to resolve disputes among participants in natural gas transportation activities and to \ngrant access and tender rights to participate in the natural gas master plan. Gas prices charged \nto industrial and other customers not classified as small-scale will be unregulated and will be \ndetermined bilaterally between the customer and the provider of gas and the margin on the gas \nprice will not be subject to regulation.  \n \n9.  BPH  Migas  has  undergone  capacity  building  to  fully  operationalize  its  downstream \nregulatory  functions.  Under  the  current  arrangements,  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mineral \nResources (MEMR) is responsible for policy making, regulation of the upstream part, and \u2013 \ntogether  with  BPH  Migas  \u2013  regulation  of  the  downstream  part.2   BP  Migas  acts  as  the \ncontracting authority in the upstream part, and BPH Migas in the downstream part. The dual role \nof  regulator  and  contracting  authority  played  by  BPH  Migas  may  raise  concerns  among \noperators  about  its  objectivity  in  the  case  of  contractual  disputes.  The  subdivision  of  the \ncontracting authority for the upstream and downstream business between  BP  Migas  and  BPH \nMigas  may  lead  to  inconsistencies  in  the  planning  and  implementation  of  upstream  and \ndownstream  projects.  Consequently,  the  current  arrangements  should  be  reviewed  in  the \nmedium term, with a view to creating a single regulatory body and a single contracting agency, \nand ensuring that the former has no links to the latter and is fully independent.3  \n \n \n                                                 \n2  The regulatory role within MEMR is exercised by its Directorate General of Oil and Gas (DG Migas). \n3  Such independence can be achieved by giving the new regulatory body a statutory authority and ensuring that it \n(i) has adequate technical expertise, (ii) reports to the President of Indonesia, (iii) has no financial stake in any \nsector operator, (iv) is financially autonomous through funding from levies on the regulated industry, (v) is headed \nby commissioners appointed for fixed terms and on the basis of transparent selection criteria, and (vi) has an \nappropriate stakeholder representation. Apart from managing tariffs not prescribed by contract or determined by \nthe market, the new body should take over some other regulatory functions currently exercised by MEMR, such as \nissuing licenses and setting service standards. \n ", "  Appendix 3      23          \nBACKGROUND ON PGN \n \n1.  PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero) Tbk (PGN) is Indonesia\u2019s leading natural gas \nutility, dominating the gas distribution market while also serving as the leading provider of gas \ntransmission services. \n \n2.  PGN started operations as a private Dutch company, Firma L.J.N. Eindhoven & Co. \nGravenhage, in 1859. This Dutch entity was the first to introduce manufactured gas made from \ncoal to Indonesia. In 1958, the Indonesian Government assumed control of the entity and \nchanged its name to Badan Pengambil Alih Perusahaan-Perusahaan Listrik dan Gas, becoming \nBadan Pimpinan Usaha \u2013 Perusahaan Listrik Negara (BPU-PLN) in 1961. On May 13, 1965, \nBPU-PLN was established as a state company and became known as Perusahaan Negara Gas \n(PN Gas). Pursuant to subsequent Government Regulations No. 27 of 1984 PN Gas was \nconverted into a public service enterprise under the name Perusahaan Umum Gas Negara. \nPGN became a limited liability company and adopted its current name in 1996 and the company \nwas given an exclusive license to develop and distribute natural gas and manufactured gas in \nIndonesia. Pursuant to the New Oil and Gas Law passed in 2001, PGN is deemed to have a \nlicense to continue its existing distribution and transmission business. PGN\u2019s 59.75%-owned \nsubsidiary, Transgasindo, has a license to conduct its transmission business which was issued \non February 26, 2002.  As at 1 June 2006, PGN has a total of 1,274 permanent employees, at \nthe parent level and in Transgasindo, its subsidiary. \n \n3.  PGN operates its business through various strategic business units based on regions \nand through one subsidiary. Three strategic business units have been formed for the distribution \nbusiness: SBU I, covering West Java and South Sumatra area, SBU II covering East Java and \nCentral Java, and SBU III covering North Sumatra.

PGN has distribution district networks in Jakarta, Surabaya, Medan, Bogor, Cirebon, \nPalembang, Batam Island and Pekanbaru with a combined 3,172 km of pipelines and a capacity \nof 1,066 mmscfd as at 31 March 2006. PGN\u2019s distribution business in these seven districts in \nthe three months ended 31 March 2006 distributed an average of 337 mmscfd of natural gas, \nprincipally to industrial customers. Demand for natural gas in Indonesia has been increasing, in \npart as a result of the progressive reduction of fuel oil subsidies which began in 2001 and which \nhas made natural gas an attractive alternative fuel. In order to meet this increasing demand, \nPGN has plans to expand its distribution business to include networks in two districts, Lampung \nand  Semarang  which  are  strategically  located  in  close  proximity  to  the  proposed  new \ntransmission pipelines, as well as to expand its existing networks. \n \n6.  Most of PGN\u2019s distribution networks have operated below full capacity in recent years \ndue to supply constraints. Demand generally has exceeded the volume of natural gas which \ncould be transported to the company\u2019s distribution networks due to the limitations of the existing \ngas transmission infrastructure in Indonesia. PGN expects that the construction of planned new \ntransmission  pipelines,  including  the  Project,  will  assist  in  reducing  existing  gas  supply \nconstraints and will allow PGN to increase utilization of its distribution networks, as well as \nconstraining upward pressure on gas supply prices.  \n \n7.  PGN\u2019s  transmission  network  currently  comprises  (i)  the  Grissik-to-Duri  transmission \npipeline  in  Sumatra  through  which  ConocoPhillips  ships  gas  under  a  gas  transportation \nagreement  to  Caltex;  and  (ii)  the  Grissik-to-Singapore  transmission  pipeline  through  which \nPertamina ships gas under a gas transportation agreement to PowerGas of Singapore, both of \nwhich are owned and operated through PGN\u2019s 59.75%-owned subsidiary, Transgasindo; and  \n(iii) two small transmission operations in Medan and Jakarta used by Pertamina to supply gas to \npower stations and CNG filling stations. The Grissik-to-Duri, Grissik-to-Singapore and Medan \ntransmission systems consist of 1,074 km of pipelines with a combined capacity of 869 mmscfd \nwhile  the  Jakarta  transmission  system  utilizes  the  existing  distribution  pipelines.  PGN\u2019s \ntransmission network transported an average of 676 mmscfd of natural gas in the 3 months \nended 31 March 2006.   \n \n8.  In addition to its existing transmission network, PGN has begun the construction of \nPhases I and II of the South Sumatra-to-West Java transmission pipeline project and has \nreceived approval for a transmission pipeline from Duri to Medan. PGN also intends to tender \nfor the right to develop other gas transmission pipeline projects which are put out to public \ntender by BPH Migas as part of the Government\u2019s plan to develop Indonesia\u2019s integrated gas \ntransmission and distribution network.1 These projects are namely: the East-Kalimantan to Java \nand Sengkang to Makassar transmission pipelines. \n  \nA.  Corporate Governance \n9.  PGN can be cited as a model for SOE reform.  In December 2003 PGN listed its shares \non the Jakarta and Surabaya stock exchanges with an Initial Public Offering which saw the \nGovernment reduce its shareholding in PGN to 61%.  Although the Government retains a \n                                                 \n1  To promote the use of natural gas and to ensure that existing demand can be satisfied, the Government has \nindicated its plans to establish a national integrated transmission and distribution network for piped natural gas. \nThis integrated network is expected to comprise pipelines that will connect gas fields and customers from North \nSumatra through Java to East Kalimantan. In order to plan for and develop this network, the Government has \nprepared a natural gas Master Plan, which includes the development of new transmission and distribution projects. \nAll new projects under the Master Plan are subject to an open tender process and PGN intends to compete for the \nrights to develop, own and operate selected new projects under the Master Plan. \n ", "26  Appendix 3   \nSpecial Share and has the power to direct PGN\u2019s activities, it has allowed the company to \noperate as an independent, commercial entity. \n \n10.  PGN\u2019s listing has subjected it to company law and other laws that apply to private sector \ncompanies.  Listing  has  also  subjected  PGN\u2019s  commercial  performance  to  monitoring  by \nshareholders other than the Government because shareholders have a residual rather than \nprior claim on the firm\u2019s asset.  The significant rise in PGN\u2019s share price since the IPO, from the \nlisting price of Rp1,500 to Rp12,600 at 1 June 2006 may be seen as a reflection of market \nconfidence  and  is  to  a  large  extent  supported  by  PGN\u2019s  reputation  for  good  corporate \ngovernance. PGN was awarded the top performing listed company 2006 by Investor, a local \nbusiness magazine, in April 2006.  \n \n11.  As a publicly listed company, PGN is also subject to the requirements of the Indonesian \nCapital Markets Supervisory Agency (Bapepam) regarding independent board members, and an \nindependent audit committee which is not to be chaired by chairman of the board.  PGN has two \nindependent commissioners on its board of commissioners (BOC) whose task is to monitor the \noperations  of  the  business  on  behalf  of  the  public  investors.  PGN  has  also  formed  an \nindependent audit committee, currently chaired by one of the independent commissioners, \nwhich is responsible to report to the BOC on the financial condition of the company, business \nmanagement and to increase the effectiveness of internal and external audit functions. \n \n12.  PGN received an ISO 9001:2000 certificate from Lloyd\u2019s Register Quality Assurance in \n2003, and in 2005, PGN committed itself to implement good corporate governance principles of \ntransparency, independence, accountability and fairness. As part of its corporate governance, \nPGN requires its staff to adhere to its Standard Operating Procedures for safety in emergency \nsituations for transmission and distribution pipelines; operations and maintenance of distribution \npipelines; and pipeline design standards, which have all been developed following international \ncodes of practice. \n13.  As part of its SOE reforms, PGN is required to borrow from private lenders without the \nbenefit  of  a  government  guarantee,  subjecting  it  to  scrutiny  by  commercial  lenders  and \ninternational credit rating agencies. In 2003, the company issued its first $150 million unsecured \nEurobond and in 2004, PGN raised its second Eurobond amounting $125 million. Both its bonds \nwere rated B by Moody\u2019s. In mid 2005 PGN started discussions with international commercial \nbanks to raise debt financing for its South Sumatra \u2013 West Java Phase II project, on corporate \nbasis, without government guarantee. \n \n14.  In implementing the SSWJ Phase II project, PGN\u2019s commitment to rehabilitate an area of \nlost mangrove habitat at the coast lines of Labuhan Maringgai and Muara Bekasi the two points \nwhere the pipeline meets the sea, demonstrates PGN\u2019s appreciation of environmental mitigation \nefforts.  In managing its land acquisition for the project, a formal grievance mechanism is in \nplace and communicated to affected people. As of 1 June 2006, land acquisition has reached \n99.9% for the Pagardewa to Labuhan Maringgai section, 71% for the Grissik to Pagardewa \nsection and 40% for the Muara Bekasi to Rawa section.  To date, no formal complaint has been \nfiled. \n \nB.  Management Team \n15.  PGN\u2019s management team comprises a five member board of directors (BOD) whose \nactivities are monitored by the six members of the BOC. In compliance with Jakarta Stock \nExchange regulations on annual general meetings (AGMs), PGN\u2019s next AGM is scheduled to be \nheld on 8 June 2006.  \n ", "  Appendix 3  27\n      \n \n16.  All  current  members  of  PGN\u2019s  BOD  and  BOC  have  extensive  experience  in  the \nIndonesian oil and gas industry.  Members of its BOD have served the company for long period \nof service, ranging from 12 to 23 years.

The consolidated financial statements of PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero) Tbk \n(PGN) for the years ended 31 December 2004 and 2005 have been prepared in accordance \nwith  Indonesia  accounting  standards.  The  statements  have  been  audited  by  independent \nauditors Prasetio, Sarwoko & Sandjaja (a member firm of Ernst & Young) who have been given \nan unqualified audit opinion.  The statements consolidate PGN\u2019s 59.75% owned subsidiary, PT \nTransportasi Gas Indonesia (Transgasindo) which accounted for 21% of revenues and 39% of \ntotal assets in 2005. Transgasindo\u2019s financial statements were audited by other auditors who \nhave provided an unqualified report on these statements to PGN\u2019s auditors \n \nA.  Income Statement and Profitability  \n2.  PGN\u2019s total revenues have increased steadily over the past three years, reflecting the \nexpansion of the company\u2019s distribution and transmission business.  In 2005 PGN generated \ntotal  revenues  of  Rp5.4  trillion  (equivalent  to  $584  million)  comprising  (a)  Rp4.3  trillion \n(equivalent to $460 million) from distribution, and (b) Rp 1.1 trillion (equivalent to $124 million) \nfrom transmission.  Cost of goods sold in 2005 was Rp2.6 trillion (equivalent to $285 million), \nrepresenting  49%  of  revenues.    Total  operating  expenses  (transmission,  distribution  and, \ngeneral and administration) were Rp1.2 trillion (equivalent to $132 million) or 23% of total \nrevenue.  PGN\u2019s income from operations was Rp1.6 trillion (equivalent to $167 million) and the \ncompany\u2019s total pretax profit was Rp1.4 trillion (equivalent to $147 million).   \n \n3.  Revenues were generated from (i) selling 112,304 million standard cubic feet (mmscf) of \ngas through seven distribution networks in West Java, East Java and Sumatra; (ii) transporting \nan average of 219,890 mmscf through three transmission lines.  Revenues from operations, \nyear on year, grew 24% in 2004 and 22% in 2005, reflecting higher gas volume sales and \nhigher gas sales prices.  Operating income grew 22% in 2004 and 56% in 2005.  Net income in \n2004 was negatively affected by large forex losses of Rp242 billion (equivalent to $26 million) \nwhile in 2005, forex losses were significantly lower, at Rp91 billion (equivalent to $ 10 million). \nThe increase in revenue, together with better cost control and substantially lower forex losses, \nled to net income of  Rp862 billion (equivalent to $93  million) for 2005, which represented an \n82% increase compared to the prior year\u2019s net income.

Introduction \n1.  The proposed South Sumatra \u2013 West Java Gas Transmission Project (the Project) is \none of two gas pipelines that PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero) Tbk (PGN) has planned to \ntransport natural gas from South Sumatra to West Java. The Project pipeline will run in the \nsame corridor from Pagardewa to Labuhan Maringgai with the other gas pipeline (SSWJ-Phase \nI). The two projects require separate gas pipelines as the gas from the Pagardewa gas field is \ndifferent in quality from that of the Grissik gas field. \n \n2.  In conformance with Indonesia\u2019s environmental impact analysis (AMDAL) regulation,1 \nPGN prepared three AMDALs, respectively, for section 1-the onshore pipeline from Grissik to \nPagardewa in South Sumatra; section 2-the onshore pipeline from Pagardewa to Labuhan \nMaringgai also in South Sumatra; and section 3-the undersea pipeline from Labuhan Maringgai \nto the shore at Muara Bekasi in West Java and the onshore pipeline from Muara Bekasi to \nRawa Maju. This summary initial environmental examination (SIEE) summarizes major findings \nof  the  three  AMDALs  and  updates  of  the  original  assessments  based  on  latest  available \ninformation on land use and forest along the proposed pipeline corridor.   \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n \n3.  The Project will construct 196 kilometers (km) of steel pipelines of 36 inches, and 465 \nkm of 32 inches. Major facilities along the Project corridor will include 2 receiving stations, 1 \ndelivery station, 2 gas compressor stations, and a supervisory control and data acquisition \n(SCADA) system. \n \n4.  The pipeline will be laid in a 25 m wide corridor for both Phase I & II pipelines. Each pipe \nwill be laid at about 9 m from the boundaries of the pipeline corridor right of way. The pipeline \ncorridor will be cleared of vegetation and debris. The pipes will be buried in trenches at least 1.5 \nm deep below ground surface. Except for the top 0.25 m, excavated soil will be backfilled, \nleveled, and compacted in layers of 0.2 m to prevent subsidence and stress on the buried pipe. \nFor the top 0.25 m, the excavated topsoil will be used for backfilling up to a height 0.1 m above \nthe  natural  ground.  The  topsoil  will  not  be  compacted  mechanically.  After  the  pipeline  is \ncompleted, markers will be placed along the pipeline at 1 km intervals. \n \n5.  Pipeline construction across small water courses will be done using an open cut method. \nAt major river crossing, pipes will be laid using a horizontal directional drilling (HDD). At major \nroad crossings, a thrust boring (TB) method will be used to avoid traffic disturbances. For small \nroad crossings, an open cut method will be used. \n \n6.  The offshore pipeline will cross the Java Sea and the Jakarta Bay. Generally, the pipe \nwill be laid on the sea bed for water depths greater than 13 m. For water depths less than 13 m, \nthe pipe will be buried.  In areas with heavy sea traffic, the pipe will be covered by rock armour \nto protect the pipeline from ship anchors. For crossing with other undersea facilities, such as \nfiber  optic  cables  and  other  undersea  pipes,  the  pipes  will  be  laid  on  concrete  mattress \nsupports.  \n                                                 \n1  Decree of the Minister for the Environment no. 17 of the year 2001. \n \n ", "38     Appendix 6 \n \n7.  Routine inspection and maintenance of the pipeline during the project operation will be \ndone by foot patrols and the use of vehicles. For annual inspections, helicopters may be used. \n \n8.  The Project requires about 1,250 ha of land consisting of 1,165 ha in South Sumatra and \n85 ha in West Java. As of February 2006, PGN has acquired about 77% and 80% of land for the \npipeline corridors in South Sumatra and in West Java, respectively. PGN expects to complete \nthe land acquisition by October 2006. The Project will affect 4,980 households along the 500 km \nland corridor due to the loss of income earned from crops and trees in the acquired land. Only \n40 structures, including rudimentary farm field shelters and wooden houses, will be physically \naffected. After the pipeline is laid, cultivation and building construction on the corridor will be \nprohibited.  \n   \n9.  PGN will be responsible for overall management of the Project, including construction \nand  operations.  Project  implementation  will  be  under  the  responsibility  of  the  director  of \ndevelopment. After project completion, operations of the pipeline system will be under the \nresponsibility of the director of operations. About 176 persons will be required for the operations \nof the gas pipeline system.  \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n  1.  Physical Environment \n10.  The onshore pipeline sections in south Sumatra and in West Java will be constructed on \nrelatively flat land with 0\u20133% slope and with elevations ranging from 10 to 38 m above mean \nsea level. The 466 km section from Grissik to Labuhan Maringgai in Sumatra will traverse \nplantations, areas designated as forests, farm lands, paddy fields and settlements.  \n \n11.  Hydrocarbon levels in the air of West Java ranged from 23.2\u2013105.2 \u00b5g/m3, and those in \nSouth Sumatra 11.15\u201328.0 \u00b5g/m3. The hydrocarbon levels were well below the safety threshold \nof 160 \u00b5g/m3. \n \n12.  The pipeline in South Sumatra will cross 21 major rivers. The Muara Bekasi-Rawa Maju \nsection in West Java will cross three major rivers. The major rivers in South Sumatra upstream \nand downstream of the pipeline crossings are mainly used for transportation. In West Java, the \nrivers are mainly used for irrigation.  \n \n13.  The rivers in West Java are grossly polluted by industrial and domestic wastes. The \nrivers in South Sumatra are relatively less polluted and the quality meets the provincial water \nquality standard for raw water supply sources. \n \n14.  Sea water quality between Labuhan Maringgai and Muara Bekasi shows a slight degree \nof pollution against the standards for marine life, Decree No. 51/2004, Ministry of Environment. \nThe coastal water around Muara Bekasi was found to be more polluted than that of Labuhan \nMaringgai due to higher densities of population, industrial and other economic activities. \n \n  2.  Biological Environment \n15.  Forests in Sumatra have long been encroached upon by various development activities, \nparticularly for large oil palm and rubber plantations. Most of the remaining forests in South \nSumatra exist in small and isolated patches scattered in the region and provide no significant \n ", "      Appendix 6     39 \necological value to wildlife, especially the Sumatran tigers. Only 39.6 ha of land along the \ncorridor in South Sumatra are designated as forest areas, consisting of 37.8 ha in South \nSumatra Province and 1.8 ha in Lampung Province.2 The forests in West Java are small and so \ndegraded that they no longer serve an ecological function. The onshore pipeline corridor in \nWest Java will not pass through any forests. \n \n16.  The coast around Labuhan Maringgai is mostly sandy. The mangrove forests along the \ncoasts of Labuhan Maringgai and Muara Bekasi vary in density and expanse. They have been \nsubjected to considerable stress by human activities and the width has been reduced to less \nthan 20 m. In Muara Bekasi there is very little left of the mangrove forests as most of the areas \nare now being used for fishponds. \n \n17.  Most of the fish species where the pipeline will pass have economic value. There are \nalso coral fish in the Kepulauan Seribu Area, which are not classified as rare species. The \noffshore  pipeline  alignment  has  been  selected  to  avoid  the  coral  reefs  around  the  Seribu \nIslands. However, the sea areas around Labuhan Maringgai and Muara Bekasi have no coral \nreef or marine mammals of ecological importance.   \n \n  3.  Sociocultural Environment \n18.  There are 115 villages near the pipeline corridor between Grissik\u2013Labuhan Maringgai in \nSouth Sumatra and  Muara Bekasi\u2013Rawa Maju  in West Java. These villages have populations \nranging from 508 to 27,297. The villages in West Java in general have higher population \ndensities, ranging from 72 to 7,205 per km2. \n \n19.  In South Sumatra, the villagers are mostly farmers and laborers employed in rubber and \npalm oil plantations, paddy fields, farm lands, fishponds and fishing activities.  In West Java, the \nmajority of the villagers work as farmers, fishermen, and fishpond farmers. Some are self-\nemployed micro entrepreneurs in the informal economic sectors, such as vendors and small \ntraders. Some are also employees of private sector enterprises.  \n \n20.  Education infrastructure in South Sumatra is inadequate and schools are only available \nup to the elementary level. Health facilities are inadequate in South Sumatra.  Most villages are \nserved only by small health clinics providing only basic medical care. In West Java, health \nclinics at village level in Muara Bekasi are adequately equipped. Despite this, environmental \nsanitation in both areas is poor. \n \nD.   Anticipated Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n21.  Construction  activities  under  the  Project  that  could  create  adverse  environmental \nimpacts are: (i) movement of heavy equipment for trenching, transport of pipes and movement \nof personnel, (ii) clearing of vegetation within the corridor, (iii) trenching activities including \nstorage of excavated materials, (iv) laying of pipes under the rivers, (v) laying of pipes under the \nsea, and (vi) construction of the gas receiving and compressor stations. The impacts would \ninclude (i) noise, (ii) dust, (iii) loss of vegetation in the corridor, (iv) emissions from vehicles and \nheavy equipment used in the construction, and (v) increased turbidity of the river and sea water \nduring pipe laying. In general, the impacts would not be significant and they will be transient in \nnature since (i) the pipeline is a linear structure and the construction activities are confined to \nshort sections along a narrow corridor for around 5\u201310 days, (ii) the onshore corridor is mostly \n                                                 \n2   PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero) Tbk. 2006. PGN Land Compensation Data as of April 2006. \n ", "40     Appendix 6 \nwithin sparsely populated areas, and (iii) the offshore section is within areas which are not \necologically sensitive. PGN will monitor the actual environmental impacts of the Project and \nensure the mitigation plans from all the AMDAL monitoring and mitigation documents (RKL and \nRPL) are implemented. \n \n22.  To  ensure  the  system  performance  and  integrity,  a  supervisory  control  and  data \nacquisition (SCADA) system will be installed to manage the operations of the gas pipeline, \nincluding leak detection. The SCADA system will be operated from the master control station at \nBojonegara.  In  the  event  of  emergency,  the  SCADA  system  will  automatically  isolate  the \naffected pipe section by remotely operated valves. \n \n23.  PGN  will  ensure  through  contracts  that  the  contractors  will  implement  best \nenvironmental management practices in their construction to minimize normal environmental \ndisturbances associated with civil works construction. In addition, the contractors will also be \nrequired to be responsible for providing basic facilities such as temporary housing, water supply, \nbasic health care, and sanitation facilities for the work force. Heavy construction machinery and \nequipment will be moved only along the right of way.  \n \n24.  The pipeline is designed to have an economic life of 20 years. However, technically the \nworking life of the pipeline can be as long as 40 years. After its useful life, the pipeline will be \ndecommissioned to make it free from fire hazard. The decommissioning of both the onshore and \noffshore sections of the pipeline will use the same procedure. The residual natural gas in the \npipeline will be purged with nitrogen gas, followed by water. The abandoned pipes will stay \nburied filled with water.   \n \nE.   Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n25.  The AMDALs include preparation of RKL (environmental management plan (EMP)) and \nRPL (environmental monitoring plan). The EMP contains mitigation measures for all identified \nmajor impacts during the construction and operations phases, and monitoring activities to be \ncarried  out  during  the  construction  and  operations.  PGN  has  incorporated  within  each \nconstruction contract environmental management requirements to be complied with by the \ncontractor and subcontractors. In addition, the contractors will be briefed on the conditions \nimposed by the MOE on the Project, the potential problems and mitigation measures as outlined \nin  the  AMDAL  reports,  and  their  obligations  in  meeting  those  requirements.  The  EMP  is \nsummarized in an Appendix to the IEE.  \n \n26.  The  implementation  of  the  RKL/RPL  by  PGN  will  involve  the  following  activities  (i) \nmaintaining  coordination  with  the  environmental  regulatory  agencies  and  contractors  for \neffective  project environmental management, (ii) monitoring and inspection activities of the \nProject, including project sites and  enforcing reporting requirements by the contractors as \nstipulated in the contracts, (iii) coordination with the local agencies and communities to ensure \ncooperation  and  effective  execution  of  the  RKL/RPL,  and  (iv)  submission  of  semiannual \nenvironmental monitoring reports as required by MOE and the local governments during both \nconstruction and operation phases.3 \n \n27.  In the operations phase, the gas pipeline performance will be monitored by the SCADA \nsystem supplemented by foot patrolling.  \n \n                                                 \n3   The reports would also be required by ADB. \n ", "      Appendix 6     41 \n28.  During the construction, about 38 environmental staff under the manager of Quality \nAssurance and Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) will be responsible for regular monitoring \nand monthly evaluation of the environmental management results. During operations 83 HSE \nstaff  will  be  employed.  Bapedalda  (Badan  Pengendali  Dampak  Lingkungan  Daerah,  Local \nEnvironmental  Impact  Assessment  Agencies)  and  ESDM  Department  (Energi  dan  Sumber \nDaya Mineral, Energy and Mineral Resources) will monitor Project environmental performance. \nPGN will allocate approximately $50,000 annually for environmental monitoring. \n \nF.   Public Consultation and Information Disclosure \n29.  PGN has carried out extensive public consultation and disclosure with the Project\u2019s \nstakeholders since the early stage of the AMDAL process, including (i) dissemination of project \ninformation through mass media including local broadcasting. Community members who wished \nto  give  input  and  opinions  were  given  30  days  (after  the  announcements  were \nbroadcasted/published) to make submissions to the local BAPEDALDA or PGN; (ii) surveys of \npublic  attitudes  towards  the  Project;  and  (iii)  public  meetings  held  in  nine  regencies  and \nsubdistricts along the entire Project area from November 2003 to August 2005 with an average \nof 100 people attending each meeting. These meetings provided information on the Project and \nits impacts on community members. The people consulted generally supported the Project but \nexpressed some concerns regarding the adequacy of compensation for land acquisition.  \n \n30.  A survey of the attitudes of local communities towards the project reveals the following; \n(i) of those interviewed along the Grissik\u2013Pagardewa section, 78% expressed support for the \nproject, 5% stated otherwise and 17% abstained; (ii) in West Java, attitudes towards the project \nshow 47% expressed support, 39% stated otherwise and the balance abstained; and (iii) in \nLabuhan Maringgai, 40% expressed support, 45% stated otherwise and the balance abstained. \nThe survey in Labuhan Maringgai was carried out before 1999 prior to any public consultations \nheld to explain the benefits of the project. PGN will carry out further public consultations before \nOctober 2006 to gauge current attitudes for the Pagardewa-Labuhan Maringgai segment, and \ntake  proper  measures  to  address  local  communities\u2019  concern  about  the  project.  PGN  will \ncontinue public consultations including the disclosure of relevant information for the duration of \nthe Project. \n  \n31.  Based on field findings from community involvements activities, PGN has prepared a \ncommunity development program (CDP) for local communities.  The CDP will provide social \ninfrastructure (including religious activities, medical equipment and supply, renovation of school \nbuildings and supply of handbooks), consultation and counseling, and additional community \nservices based on specific needs for the communities. The CDP budget is approximately Rp 5 \nbillion and is included in the project cost. \n \nG.  Findings and Recommendations \n32.  The Project is the most practical way to increase the share of natural gas in the energy \nprofile of West Java.  Pipeline transport is the only viable option to bring natural gas from the \nonshore production fields in Sumatra to industrial and residential consumers in West Java.  \n \n33.  During  construction,  the  Project  will  create  transient  disturbances  to  environmental \nquality. However, the disturbances common to all civil work construction would not create \nsignificant impacts considering the short construction period over a section of the corridor before \nthe construction progresses to other sections of the narrow construction area.  \n \n ", "42     Appendix 6 \n34.  During the construction and operation phases, PGN will follow the mitigation measures \nand monitoring schedules identified in the three RKLs/RPLs that were approved by the MOE to \navoid  environmental  impacts  of  the  Project.  PGN  will  establish  the  manager  of  Quality \nAssurance  and  HSE  to  conduct  regular  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  environmental \nmanagement results. PGN will submit semi-annually environmental monitoring reports to both \nMOE and ADB. \n \nH.  Conclusions \n35.  The Project will create environmental benefits by replacing more polluting fuels such as \nHSD and coal, with natural gas. Based on the estimates of natural gas use, the net present \nvalue of the environmental benefits is estimated at about $74.52 million for the operating life of \n20 years and a discount rate of 8% per annum.  The Project can be justified on environmental \ngrounds because its benefits exceed its Environmental costs.     \n ", "Appendix 7     43     \nSUMMARY OF THE LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n \nA.  Project Description \n1.  The South Sumatra to West Java Phase II Gas Pipeline Project (the Project) will transport \ngas from the Grissik gas field in South Sumatra to Rawa Maju in West Java. The Project \nconsists of a 661 km pipeline and includes 500 km of onshore pipeline and 161 km of offshore \npipeline. Construction began in January 2006 and is scheduled to be completed no later than \nFebruary 2007. \nB.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n2.  The  onshore  pipeline  alignment  was  selected  because  it  minimizes  the  number  of \nstructures, persons, and the forest ecosystems affected.  The pipeline right of way (RoW) \nrequires  the  acquisition  of  land  and  other  fixed  assets.    In  South  Sumatra  and  Lampung \nprovinces, the Project will acquire 951.42 ha of privately owned land and 186.34 ha of land \nowned by corporations. In all, 4,791 land parcels belonging to 4,315 users (both legal owners \nand non-titled users) are affected. The land acquired is mainly agricultural land such as rice \nfields, traditional plantations, drylands, and arable homesteads.  Affected persons (APs) inhabit \n115 villages with a combined population of 393,426 and an average population density of 166 \nper km2.  A further 40 households will incur loss of structures, totaling 28 structures in South \nSumatra and 12 in Lampung, with an average area of 50 m2.1  No community structures and \ncommon property resources nor social facility structures will be directly affected by the Project. \nThe pipeline will have temporary impacts during construction on some public facilities such as \nirrigation canals and village roads. Since all APs in South Sumatra and Lampung have opted for \ncash compensation, no resettlement is required. Land used for the RoW in West Java will be \nleased from Perum Jasa Tirta II (PJT II). Additional data on levels of affectedness of non-\ntitleholders, APs owning or using structures and number of sharecroppers is being gathered and \nthe land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) will be updated to incorporate this data.  \nC.  Socioeconomic Information on Affected Persons \n3.  A  socio-economic  survey  conducted  in  1997  indicates  that  64%  of  the  population  in \naffected villages is in the productive age range (15\u201355 years). Average household size is about \n5\u20138 members. Farming is the main occupation for both males and females.  The secondary \noccupations of males are wage laboring, civil service, and trading while, for females, the main \nsecondary occupation is the retailing of food crop products. The average levels of education are \nelementary and junior high school levels. Skill levels are limited, mostly carpentry, mechanics, \ndriving, and handicrafts. The project area will not pass through any communities of indigenous \npeople and none of the communities along the RoW are isolated communities with closed \neconomic systems.  \nD.  Information  Dissemination,  Consultation,  Participatory  Approaches,  and \nDisclosure Requirements \n4.  Since the early stage of the land acquisition process in 2004, and prior to its acquisition \nnegotiations, PGN carried out extensive and thorough information dissemination, consultation \nand disclosure with the Project\u2019s stakeholders including: (i) information dissemination regarding \n                                                 \n1 These structures comprise semipermanent wooden houses, huts, and farm field shelters. \n ", "44     Appendix 7 \nrights to entitlements, (ii) public consultation meetings with APs, and (iii) the formation of Land \nAcquisition Committees (LACs) chaired by the vice governor or regent in each regency.  APs \nhave been able to participate in the LARP preparation through institutional channels, which are: \nvillage  governments,  village  boards  of  resilience  (LKMD),  and  district  &  regency  level \ngovernments.  PGN representatives have cooperated extensively with these institutions. \n5.  Public  consultations  have  been  carried  out  through  various  means,  including;  (i) \ndissemination of project information through the mass media.  Community members were given \n30  days  after  the  announcement  notifications  to  submit  input  and  opinions  to  the  local \nBAPEDALDA or to PGN; (ii) surveys of public attitudes towards the Project; and (iii) public \nmeetings held in nine regencies and sub-districts along the entire Project area from November \n2003 to August 2005 with an average of 100 people attending each meeting.  Those meetings \nprovided information on the Project and its impacts.  They also solicited AP views on impact \nmitigation, and sought cooperation of communities and all related parties. PGN will continue \npublic consultations, take proper measures to address local communities\u2019 concern about the \nProject and continue to disclose relevant information for the duration of the Project.  \nE.  Grievance Redress Mechanisms \n6.  The  grievance  procedure,  based  on  Presidential  Decree  No.  55/1993,  is  designed  to \nmitigate disputes regarding compensation levels for land. Since the determination of the Project \nalignment  and  the  land  acquisition  program  is  participatory  in  nature  and  carried  out  in \nconsultation  with  the  APs,  the  need  for  grievance  redress  procedures  has  been  minimal. \nHowever, complaints and grievances can still occur in the course of project implementation. All \ngrievances must be registered within a month from the announcement of the result of the \nmeasurement  and  inventory  of  the  land, structures  and  assets  and are  addressed  by  the \nrelevant  LAC.    If  the  LAC  cannot  resolve  the  problem  specifically  regarding  financial \ncompensation then the dispute sent to the district court (Pengadilan Negeri) for resolution. \nDuring the disputation settlement, the compensation is held in an escrow account by the district \ncourt.  Grievance  redress  mechanism  and  procedures  are  publicized  at  meetings  with \nstakeholders so that APs are aware of their rights and procedures for grievance redress. \nF.  Policy and Legal Framework \n7.  PGN\u2019s general policy for land acquisition, compensation and resettlement regarding gas \ntransmission and distribution projects follows Presidential Decree (KEPPRES) No. 55/19932 on \nLand Acquisition which also specifies grievance procedures for landowners; defines \"public \ninterest\" for development purposes; separates private projects which should use regular land \npurchase arrangements; places increased emphasis on community consultation and reaching \nagreement with people affected regarding the form and the amount of compensation; and which \npresents  options  for  compensation  including  substitute  land,  resettlement  and  cash.  The \nRegulation of the State Minister of Agrarian Affairs and National Land Agency No. 1 of 1994 \nspecifies  that  each  Provincial  Governor  addresses  establishment  of  a  Land  Acquisition \nCommittee or LAC3 (Panitia Pengadaan Tanah) in each kabupaten (regency/district) and kota \n                                                 \n2  Presidential Regulation (PERPRES) No. 36/2005 replaces Presidential Decree (KEPPRES) No. 55/1993, for only \n21 different categories of public works, and does not include gas transmission pipelines. \n3 Comprising: (i) Head of Kabupaten/Municipality (Bupati/Walikota) as Chairman; (ii) Head of Kabupaten/Municipality \nAgrarian/Land Office as Vice Chair; (iii) Head of Land and Building Tax Office; (iv) Head of local Public Works, \nBuildings Agency; (v) Head of local agriculture (Plantation & food Crops Agency); (vi) Head of District (Camat) \nwhere project will be build; (vii) Head of Village (Lurah); (viii) Secretary of Bupati/Walikota as First Secretary of \nCommittee; and (ix) Head of Division in local Land Office as Second Secretary of the Committee. \n ", "      Appendix 7     45 \n(municipality) to be chaired by the Bupati or Walikota, and compensation is also given to \npersons using land without any titles (Art 20).  The LAC includes representatives of the Level II \nLand Office, Tax Office, Public Works Agency, Agriculture Agency, the heads of the sub-district \nand villages where land acquisition will take place, and two additional members.  Compensation \nis provided at the same replacement rates to all affected persons including holders of hak adat \nor ulayat (customary rights), and also to long-term squatters on government land. \n8.  The policy of the Asian Development Bank on Involuntary Resettlement is set out in the \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995).  PGN  has  also  used  the  ADB  Handbook  on \nResettlement: A Guide to Good Practice (1998) and ADB Handbook on Poverty and Social \nAnalysis  (2001)  as  guidelines.    PGN\u2019s  framework  for  land  acquisition,  compensation  and \nresettlement regarding gas transmission and distribution project follows KEPPRES No. 55/1993, \nand specifies that compensation for APs will be negotiated based on the latest NJOP (Nilai Jual \nObjek Pajak, government land value) and current market value.  The scope of PGN\u2019s land \nacquisition, compensation and resettlement framework covers compensation for loss of assets \nand restoration or enhancement of livelihood of all categories of APs (directly or indirectly \naffected,  title  holders  and  non-title  holders)  and  provides  that:  (i)  compensation  and \nrehabilitation provided to APs will be sufficient to reestablish their pre-project standard of living, \nwith  the  prospect  of  improvement;  (ii)  all  APs  will  be  adequately  informed  on  eligibility, \ncompensation rates and standards, livelihood and income restoration plans, and project timing; \nand (iii) no land acquisition will take place prior to satisfactory compensation and resettlement of \nthe APs. \nG.  Eligibility and Entitlements \n9.  Payment of cash compensation, allowances and income rehabilitation will comply with \nKEPPRES 55/1993 and is witnessed by the relevant LAC and monitored by a provincial level \nmonitoring team. The compensation value for land acquisition is determined by negotiation and \nagreement (musyawarah) on the basis of replacement values, in particular when the Tax Object \nSelling Price (NJOP) is below the market price. The compensation rates used vary for different \nregions, land types, and land productivity. The budgeted amount of cash compensation for land \nacquisition in South Sumatra and Lampung Provinces, as of 12 July 2006, totaled Rp62.8 \nbillion. Compensation for the 40 structures affected by the Project is based on price estimates \nfrom PU (Ministry of Public Works) and estimated at Rp1.2 billion. Aside from receiving cash \ncompensation for land, APs also received cash compensation for the standing crops on the \nproject  affected  lands.  Total  estimated  cash  compensation  for  standing  crops  amounts  to \nRp47.9  billion.  No  social  facility  structures  are  affected  by  the  Project.  Entitlements  are \nsummarized in Table A7. \nH.  Relocation of Housing and Settlement \n10.  The selected onshore pipeline alignment minimizes the number of structures affected. \nPGN had offered APs the choice of replacement land and structures and/or cash compensation. \nThis process was officially documented, and to date, all APs have chosen to accept the offer of \ncash compensation for loss of land and structures.  Hence in the case of South Sumatra and \nLampung Provinces there is no requirement for resettlement.   \n \n \n ", "46     Appendix 7 \nI.  Income Restoration and Rehabilitation Strategy \n11.  The field survey, conducted in 2004, anticipated no significant loss of assets, income or \nlivelihood, or displacement of people due to the Project. The survey found no vulnerable groups. \nThe emphasis is on the provision of adequate compensation to ensure that the economic and \nsocial future of the APs is at least as favorable as it would have been in the absence of the \nProject. Separately, as part of its corporate responsibility program, PGN is implementing a \ncommunity development program (CDP) with an NGO (PKBL) in the area impacted by the \nProject. The CDP comprises (i) a partnership program with small scale business enterprises; \nand (ii) a community empowerment program. Aside from PKBL, PGN has also implemented a \nCDP based on the need assessment4 of people in the affected villages. The ultimate goal of \nCDP activities is to contribute to the growth of the village economies. Funding for the programs \nis allocated from PGN\u2019s profit.5 \nJ.  Budget and Financing \n12.  The total budget for implementation of the LARP is estimated at Rp161 billion.  Land \npurchase  in  South  Sumatra  (in  Lampung  and  South  Sumatra  provinces)  is  the  largest \ncomponent, accounting for Rp62.8 billion while cash compensation for trees and crops is the \nsecond largest component, at Rp47.9 billion. The estimated cost of the acquisition of land in \nWest Java is Rp17.7 billion. PGN will provide all funding for implementation of the LARP from its \nown cash resources.  \nK.  Implementation Schedules \n13.  PGN will implement a control and monitoring process to ensure that the APs receive the \ncompensation  satisfactorily  before  pipeline  construction  activity  starts  in  a  particular  area. \nInternal and external monitoring will be conducted by PGN and a third party consultant for the \nProject from March 2004 until December 2007. As of 30 June 2006, land acquisition and \ncompensation activities in the Lampung6 province have been completed.  Meanwhile for the \nprovince of South Sumatra, two out of a total of six affected7 regencies have been completed.  \nThe remaining four regencies which are located along the Grissik to Pagardewa segment of the \npipeline are expected to be completed by August 2006.   \nL.  Organizational Framework for Land Acquisition and Resettlement  \n14.  The overall responsibility for the enforcement of the policy framework and the planning and \nimplementation of the LARP lies with PGN. The Project Coordinator from PGN will maintain a \nclose liaison with the local authorities, representatives of APs and NGOs.  At the local level, the \nlocal authorities with PGN will have the responsibility for all LARP activities including surveys, \nconsultation and negotiation with the APs and acting through the LAC.  The Project Coordinator \nmakes special efforts to maintain good community relationships, and resolve compensation \nproblems and complaints including the active and effective participation of the APs in the \npreparation and implementation of LARP. The Project Coordinator monitors the Project activities \nand prepares reports for PGN\u2019s Director of Development and Director of Finance.  \n                                                 \n4 Need assessment is a survey conducted to identify potentials of the affected villages to ensure that CDP activities \nare efficient, on-target and enduring. \n5  For 2006 total funding allocated for PKBL is 1.5% of previous year\u2019s profit. \n6  Covering four affected regencies : Waykanan, TUBA, Lampung Tengah and Lampung Timur. \n7 OKU Induk and OKI Timur are completed, MUBA, Banyuasin, Muaraenim and Prabumulih are expected to be \ncompleted in August 2006. \n ", "      Appendix 7     47 \nM.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n15.  Monitoring and supervision of the LARP implementation involves internal monitoring and \nexternal monitoring.
