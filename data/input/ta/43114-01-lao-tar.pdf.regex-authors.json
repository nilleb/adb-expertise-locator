INTRODUCTION \n1.  In May 2007, the Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) \nrequested Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance to strengthen the capacity of the Water \nResources and Environment Administration (WREA). ADB provided technical assistance (TA)1 \nto update the water resources policy and strategy and design the National Integrated Water \nResources Management framework. An ADB fact-finding mission in May 2009 discussed the \nneed and scope for further capacity development assistance. Understanding was reached on \nthe terms of reference of consultants, cost estimates, and implementation arrangements for a \ncapacity development technical assistance (CDTA), which was confirmed during a consultation \nmission in November 2009, when representatives of WREA, the Government of Australia, and \nADB signed a memorandum of understanding. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Lao PDR is the source of 38% of the annual flow of the Mekong River. Each country \nin the Mekong Basin3 perceives its future opportunities and risks related to water in a very \ndifferent  way,  and  each  has  quite  different  human  resources  and  technical  and  financial \ncapacity. Managing the Mekong will increasingly require riparian countries to address cross-\nborder issues, which will demand in turn strong national capacity to deal with complex issues \nregarding water use and resource protection. The formation of WREA in May 2007 was a \nsignificant step in strengthening capacity for integrated water resources management (IWRM)4 \nin the Lao PDR, as it brings together several previously fragmented agencies and functions. \nDespite  rapid  development  in  the  water  sector,  the  Lao  PDR  has  lacked  the  capacity  to \neffectively implement IWRM. This has significantly limited its ability to (i) manage its own water \nresources  strategically  to  ensure  that  the  rapid  development  of  water-related  projects \nacceptably balances economic, social, and environmental concerns; and (ii) be an informed and \nequal partner in the international negotiations of the Mekong River Commission.5 \n \n3.  Abundant water resources and mountainous terrain are the foundation for the expanding \nhydropower industry in the Lao PDR. While the need to regulate concessions that use water \nresources is recognized, the risk remains that the processes of granting water-use concessions \ncould  limit  the  effectiveness  of  strengthened  IWRM  capacity.  In  addition  to  strengthening \ncapacity for IWRM initiatives, WREA must strengthen its capacity for assessing environmental \nimpact and enforcing environmental management plans to enable itself to fully implement its \nmandate.6   \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for Updating the National Water \nResources Policy and Strategy. Manila (TA 7013-LAO, 12 December, in the amount of $1.0 million, including $0.5 \nmillion cofinanced by the Government of Australia). The Government of Australia provided an additional $0.3 \nmillion in 2009 for additional preparation activities for implementation of the proposed CDTA. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 21 April 2010. \n3  The lower Mekong Basin countries are Cambodia, the Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Upstream, Yunnan \nProvince of the People\u2019s Republic of China and Myanmar also have riparian access to Mekong water resources.   \n4  IWRM promotes the coordinated development and management of water, land, and related resources to maximize \neconomic and social benefits in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems. \nBy definition, management integrates planning and implementation.  \n5  The lower Mekong Basin countries are members of the commission and use it to facilitate the resolution of trans-\nboundary water issues. The proposed capacity development TA will complement the ongoing IWRM capacity \nbuilding led by the commission secretariat in each member country. \n6  The Government of Finland is preparing TA to WREA specifically focused on the environmental mandate of the \nadministration. \n ", "2   \n4.  A multiplicity of sector agencies has roles in water resources management, and multiple \nlevels  of  government  are  responsible  for  developing  and  conserving  water  and  related \nresources,  each  making  development  decisions  that  affect  water  resources.  As  in  many \ncountries, the objective of rapid economic development can collide with sustainable natural \nresource  use  and  the  equitable  sharing  of resources  and  their  benefits  among  traditional, \nexisting, and new water users. An important challenge for WREA is to engage government and \nresource-using  sectors  in  river  basin  planning  and  management  to  efficiently  achieve \nsustainable and fair water use. A key issue is how to adopt the results of river basin and sub-\nbasin plans into the formal government planning process efficiently and effectively. While there \nis  some  regional  experience  with  IWRM  and  river  basin  and  sub-basin  planning,  there  is \nconcern  that  the  planning  processes  not  become  the  dominating  activity  and  delay  the \nimplementation of necessary and important investments and other actions. Thus, it is important \nfor  river  basin  planning  and  IWRM  to  accommodate  and  facilitate  obviously  necessary \ninvestments without unnecessary delay, while maintaining adequate safeguards, rights, and \nresponsibilities.  \n \n5.  In June 2010, the government approved the Decree on Establishment and Activities of \nRiver Basin Committees. The Lao PDR has established the first river basin committee, in the \nNam Ngum Basin, and is testing the new institutional arrangements to facilitate coordination \namong sectors and levels of government.  These are significant changes in the way that natural \nresources are allocated and managed. These changes require careful introduction with strong \npolitical  will  and  leadership  to  ensure  that  all  stakeholders  are  aligned  with  the  new \nmanagement regimes as they are established. The TA will help build the institutional and human \nresources required to implement the National Water Resources Policy and Strategy7 that will \nguide activities in the water sector and will provide timely assistance to support the development \nof basin committees and assist in the mobilization of stakeholders. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The impact of the National Integrated Water Resources Management Support Project \nwill be that water resources are managed in the Lao PDR river basins for sustainable economic, \nsocial, and environmental objectives. The outcome of the TA will be that the necessary human \nresources and institutional capacity will have been established in WREA, river basin committees, \ntheir secretariats, and other key agencies for integrated water resources management.   \n \n7.  The TA will contribute to the implementation of the National Integrated Water Resources \nManagement Support Program.8 It will assist the government: (i) establish gender-responsive \nprofessional development programs for WREA staff; (ii) implement appropriate governance \nsystems  for  project  management,  monitoring,  and  evaluation;  (iii)  establish  institutional \narrangements  for  river  basin  management;  (iv)  provide  updates  on  the  inventory  of  water \nresources and their utilization; and (v) assist the development of formal university education in \nIWRM at the National University of Lao (NUOL).  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The outputs of the project will provide the foundations for a national approach to IWRM \nincluding river basin and sub-basin planning and management, and equip the Lao PDR to \nparticipate more equally and effectively in regional activities. The support project will provide a \n                                                 \n7  WREA. 2010. National Water Resources Strategy and Action Plan for the Years 2011\u20132015. Vientiane (mimeo). \n8  The National Integrated Water Resources Support Program is the framework used by WREA to coordinate donor \nfunds  with  resources  available  through  the  national  budget.  The  framework  includes  ten  components \ndesigned to establish the necessary capacity for IWRM in Lao PDR. \n ", "  3\nroad map for achieving effective IWRM and provide WREA with a nationally owned project as a \nbasis  for  (i)  strategic  planning  in  the  sector;  (ii)  human  resources  development;  (iii)  the \ninstitutional upgrading of water resource data collection, management, and processing; (iv) work \nand budget planning; and (v) the coordinated mobilization of resources from the government \nand external development partners.  \n \n9.  The TA will be implemented over 4 years with four outputs designed to complement \nactivities funded by other development partners which are outside the scope of ADB TA.9 The \nTA outputs will directly assist in implementing the water resources strategy and action plan \n(footnote 7). Each package will focus on outputs that contribute to the outcome of positioning \nWREA at the center of sustainable IWRM, with resource development and water services \nprovided through appropriate line agencies and the private sector. The TA will help WREA to (i) \nidentify entry points for mainstreaming climate change concerns in water resources planning \nand management at both the policy and operational level and (ii) strengthen the capacity of \ndecision makers to climate-proof water infrastructure. The TA will extend the impact of support \nto WREA capacity building for climate change adaptation.10  \n \n10.  Output 1: National capacity built in integrated water resources management. The \nproject will help the WREA cabinet and participating departments to implement appropriate \nproject  and  project  management  systems  to  ensure  good  governance  of  the  project  and \nsubsequent  WREA  operations.  The  TA  will  focus  immediately  on  building  the  capacity  of \nWREA\u2019s  project  management  unit  (PMU),  located  in  the  Department  of  Water  Resources \n(DWR), to effectively coordinate project management and serve as the secretariat of the project \nnational steering committee. It will support continuing professional development for WREA staff \nin cooperation with relevant WREA departments, Mekong River Commission training projects, \nand the NUOL. Training courses will be aimed at management, technicians, and trainers of \ntrainers. Capacity development will include priority training projects for the staff of national \nagencies;  emerging  basin  organizations;  provincial  agencies;  and  academic,  private,  and \nnongovernment  organizations.  Training  will  be  provided  on  the  role  of  IWRM  and  basin \nmanagement  in  climate  change  adaption  and  mitigation  in  rural  communities.  Capacity \ndevelopment  will  promote  actions  to  help  implement  the  gender  action  plan  of  the  Prime \nMinister\u2019s Office and develop a gender action plan to ensure that WREA capacity development \nand field operations are implemented in gender responsive way. \n11.  The WREA professional development program will coordinate capacity development and \ntraining across the organization to ensure that appropriate training opportunities and subjects \nare available to WREA management and staff in coordination with other capacity development \nprograms, including that of the Mekong River Commission. \n \n12.  The  TA  will  help  WREA  to  establish  gender  disaggregated  project  monitoring  and \nevaluation systems and the necessary performance management capability in the monitoring \nand  evaluation  unit  in  the  WREA  Cabinet  Office  to  implement  the  WREA  monitoring \nframework.11 \n \n \n                                                 \n9  Pipeline support for WREA: (i) World Bank Mekong Integrated Water Resources Management Project (Lao PDR \ncomponent estimated at $4.0 million), late 2010; (ii) Government of Finland estimated at $8.0 million, 2010, \nGerman development cooperation through KfW in kind support for basin management, 2010. A shared project \nmanagement unit is being established by WREA with the assistance of ADB TA (footnote 1). \n10 ADB. 2010.

The project will help WREA develop \nand implement IWRM in river basins, including dealing with large projects in water resources \ndevelopment, working across sectors and with communities and the private and public sectors. \nThe TA will focus on developing and testing appropriate river basin institutional arrangements \nadapted to local conditions in selected pilot river basins,12 ultimately leading to river basin plans \nbeing integrated into government  planning and investment decisions. The TA will promote \nIWRM as key to mainstreaming climate change adaptation into resource management in the \nLao PDR. Three case studies will help develop specific climate change adaptation interventions \nin the Nam Ngum Basin relevant at both the farm and sub-basin level to assess barriers and \nidentify potential countermeasures.13 The national water resources inventory will be updated to \ncategorize basins and to identify critical IWRM issues and locations. \n \n14.  Output 3: National groundwater management action plan prepared. The project will \nassist  the  WREA  units  responsible  for  groundwater  management  in  preparing  an  initial \napproach to and action plan for managing groundwater systematically for sustainable use. The \nTA will enable WREA to (i) assess key public and private stakeholders and their groundwater \ninformation needs and uses and assess institutional, policy, and standards settings; (ii) assess \nexisting information, data, and the understanding of key stakeholders and estimate, on a river \nbasin and groundwater basin basis, probable groundwater resources, conditions, usage, and \ndemand;  (iii)  evaluate  monitoring  networks  and  databases,  practices,  and  procedures  and \nrecommend improvements; and (iv) assess the training needs of groundwater management \nspecialists, including identifying the units and/or staff members to target, so that the training is \nrelevant and focused. \n \n15.  Output 4: Integrated water resources management education strengthened at the \nNational  University  of  Laos.  The  project  will  assist  the  Water  Resource  Engineering \nDepartment (WRED) of the NUOL in preparing the strategic plan and detailed proposals for \nbachelor-level qualification in IWRM. The TA will initiate the retraining of WRED teaching staff \nand support the in-house development of the strategic plan and proposals for future support. \nWRED will review IWRM good practices and implementation experience, as well as governance \nand  institutions;  stewardship;  management  devolution  to  the  lowest  appropriate  level; \norganizational functions at the national, river basin, and local level; and stakeholder participation \nin  decision-making  regarding  the  trade-offs  among  economic,  social,  and  environmental \nobjectives. Specialist assistance will be provided to advise the curriculum development team on \nmainstreaming climate change into the IWRM degree project at the NUOL. The strategic plan \nand detailed proposal will present the rationale for the proposed curriculum and retraining of \nteaching  staff,  including  a  design  and  monitoring  framework  and  detailed  monitoring  and \nevaluation plans as the basis for seeking support for tertiary IWRM training. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $4,210,000, toward which the government has requested \nADB financing of $3,900,000 (Appendix 2). ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV) \nwill finance $300,000 as a grant. The Government of Australia A$3,200,000, and the Spanish \nCooperation Fund for Technical Assistance $600,000 will provide grant finance administered by \nADB. The government will finance the balance equivalent of $310,000 in kind by providing \ncounterpart staff, offices, and other support required for implementing the TA. Output 1 is \nestimated to cost $1,125,000; output 2 $2,245,000; output 3 $535,000; and output 4 $305,000. \nAdditional financing may be sought for a second phase based on an evaluation of progress \n                                                 \n12 The Nam Ngum River Basin Committee, managed by the newly created River Basin Committee Secretariat in \nVientiane Province, is the priority basin because of ongoing hydropower and mine development.  \n13 Interventions may include water harvesting, zero tillage, changing cropping patterns and varieties, water allocation \nand sharing, increasing water storage capacity, reusing wastewater, and water pricing and water rights. \n ", "  5\ntoward  the  end  of  year  3  of  implementation.  Evidence  of  the  development  of  sustainable \nfinancing of WREA and RBC operations will be monitored and assessed during implementation. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  WREA will be the executing agency for the overall support project. WREA has appointed \na national project director in the DWR to lead the PMU.14 The implementing agencies for the TA \nare (i) the WREA PMU for output 1, (ii) the DWR in partnership with river basin committees and \ntheir secretariats (footnote 12) for output 2, (iii) the Water and Environment Research Institute \nand the DWR for output 3, and (iv) the NUOL Water and Engineering Department for output 4. \nThe monitoring and evaluation of the overall progress of the support project will be by the \nWREA Cabinet Office Project Monitoring and Evaluation Unit following the agreed monitoring \nframework (footnote 11). A national steering committee and development partner group will \nguide project implementation. ADB, the Government of Australia, and the Government of Spain \nwill participate in semiannual joint review missions. The TA will be implemented over a 4-year \nperiod expected to commence in early 2011. Consulting services packages will be approved for \nimplementation based on the progress of the TA following reviews by ADB, the Australian \nAgency for International Development, the Government of Spain, and WREA to ensure WREA \nhas the capacity to absorb additional project inputs. \n \n18.  Consulting  services  will  total  269  person-months,  comprising  66  person-months  of \ninternational consultancy and 203 person-months of national consultancy in five packages. The \noutline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  are  in  Appendix  3.  International  and  national \nconsultants will be recruited by the PMU through consulting firms using ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-\nbased system at a ratio of 90:10,15 with either simplified or full technical proposals.16 Individual \nconsultants may be engaged for special studies and TA following agreement between WREA \nand ADB on assignments. All consultants will be recruited by ADB following its Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The procurement of equipment \nfor the TA will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time), and \nall equipment will be transferred to the implementing agencies on TA completion. The proceeds \nof the TA will be disbursed in line with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION AND DECISION \n19.  The President recommends that the Board approve ADB administering a portion of \ntechnical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of A$3,200,000 to the Lao PDR for the \n \nNational Integrated Water Resources Management Support Project, to be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Government of Australia. If the Board approves ADB administering the technical \nassistance, the President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, will approve (i) \nADB  administering  a  portion  of  the  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of \n$600,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the Spanish Cooperation Fund for Technical \nAssistance; and (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a \ngrant basis for the National Integrated Water Resources Management Support Project. \n                                                 \n14 The PMU will be established before the capacity development TA is effective. The procedures and accounting \nsystems for the PMU are being developed through consulting services provided by TA 7013-LAO during 2010. The \nPMU will manage the World Bank-financed Mekong IWRM Project in the Lao PDR, due for approval in 2011. \n15 A ratio of 90:10 is proposed to meet the need for high-quality consulting services for this project. \n16 Simplified technical proposals will be used for packages 3 and 4, which are budgeted at less than $600,000. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n    Data Sources and   \n  Performance Targets and  Reporting   \nDesign Summary  Indicators  Mechanisms   Assumptions and Risks \nImpact  By 2020 in five basins:    Risk \n    Project investment  Critical decisions may be \nWater resources  Investment decisions are  plans and proposals  made before WREA has \nmanaged in Lao PDR  consistent with IWRM river  reported in the River  significant influence. \nriver basins for  basin plans   Basin Committee and   \nsustainable economic,  (baseline 2010 = 0).
