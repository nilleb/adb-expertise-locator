INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of Mongolia requested knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) \nfrom the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support the implementation of the National Program \non  Gender  Equality  (2017\u20132021)  and the  Ulaanbaatar  Declaration,1 adopted  under TA for \nGender-Responsive Sector and Local Development Policies and Actions financed by the Japan \nFund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR).2 The TA is consistent with the objectives of ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy, 2017\u20132020 for Mongolia.3 In line with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, ADB will support \nMongolia\u2019s efforts to achieve gender equality by supporting enforcement of gender equality \nlegislation and strengthening collaboration with civil society organizations (CSOs).4 The TA is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2019\u20132021 for Mongolia.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Gender inequality is an obstacle to economic growth and poverty reduction, and the \nSustainable  Development  Goals  prioritize  gender  equality  and  women\u2019s  empowerment. 6 \nMongolia is committed to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, and the TA will support \nMongolia by strengthening policies and legislation aimed at promoting gender equality and \nwomen\u2019s empowerment. \n \n3.  Mongolia has a comprehensive gender legislative framework, but enforcement remains \ninadequate because of (i) limited capacity and accountability of government institutions to conduct \ngender analysis and mainstream gender in policy planning and budgeting; (ii) insufficient cross-\nsector coordination by the government, including with CSOs; (iii) a lack of sex-disaggregated data \nin some sectors; and (iv) the prevalence of strong gender stereotypes in all spheres of society, \nas revealed by the study on public perceptions and attitudes on gender inequality issues under \nprevious JFPR-funded TA (footnote 2). For instance, out of 1,000 respondents, over 70% of men \nthink men should hold executive position in government while women should take implementing \npositions.  Further,  women  of  various  ages  with  differing  levels  of  education  highlighted \npronounced gender-specific barriers that hinder their access to jobs and career opportunities. As \na result, a relatively large share of women (40.5%) are employed in precarious informal work and \nunpaid family work (women spend more than twice as much time on caregiving duties and \nhousehold chores as men). Women participate far less in entrepreneurial work than do men, and \nthe imbalance is most acute in rural areas. In 2016, 33.6% of all workers (35.4% of all men and \n31.7% of all women) were employed in agriculture, but women are not reaping the full benefits of \ntheir labor in the pastoral economy. Across all immovable assets, women account for less than \n40% of dwelling owners and around 20% of agricultural land owners.7 \n \n                                                \n1  Government of Mongolia. 2018.

Effective engagement of civil society at all levels is crucial to ensure local government and \nservice  providers  are  accountable  to  the  public.  An  estimated  19,260  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) are registered in Mongolia, with about 21% operating at the local level. \nHowever,  local  NGOs  lack  experience  in  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  and  public \ncommunication  to  promote  gender  equality  at  the  grassroots  level.  Although  the  Law  on \nPromotion of Gender Equality, adopted with ADB\u2019s support in 2011, stipulates the importance of \ncivil society\u2019s role in monitoring the implementation of the law, the government does not prioritize \ncapacity building of CSOs. Effort is also needed to reach out to the private sector, particularly \nmicro  entrepreneurs,  to  support  women\u2019s  entrepreneurship  and  gender  inclusive  practices \nthrough financial and nonfinancial support, including training on financial literacy and facilitation \nof access to markets for businesses owned by women. \n \n5.  ADB has actively engaged with the National Committee on Gender Equality (NCGE) in \nMongolia since 2009, including by supporting the design and adoption of the gender equality law, \nand through capacity building for effective law enforcement. As shown by international good \npractice, implementing the gender equality legislation based on sector-specific gender strategies \nis critical. In this regard, the government has accelerated policy initiatives through the adoption of \nthe National Program on Gender Equality, and sectoral and local-level gender policies and \nsubprograms since 2016. The TA will build on previous ADB support to ensure the practical \napplication of the policy documents on gender equality at national, sector, and local levels, while \nfostering the sustainability of the policies.8 The TA will also complement ongoing regional TA for \ndeepening civil society engagement for development effectiveness.9 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n6.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: (i) gender equality in political, legal, economic, \nsocial,  cultural,  and  family  relations  substantially  promoted;  and  (ii)  sustainable  social \ndevelopment objectives ensuring gender equality substantially achieved.10 The TA will have the \nfollowing outcome: CSOs\u2019 engagement in implementation of gender equality programs at national, \nsector, and local levels improved.11 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n7.  Output  1:  Knowledge and  understanding  of  government  staff,  nongovernment \norganizations, and private sector to operationalize gender agenda improved. To ensure the \npractical application of the national, focus sector, and local gender equality programs, the project \nwill provide training (i) on gender mainstreaming for about 151 local government officials working \nin public administration, food, agriculture, and light industries of Selenge aimag (province);12 and \n(ii) on participatory M&E of focus sector gender policy implementation for about 20 NGOs working \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2003.

Grant Assistance Report: Proposed Administration of Grant to \nMongolia for Combating Domestic Violence against Women and Children. Manila (Grant 9198-MON). \n ", "3 \nin the food, agriculture, and light industry sectors. To support women\u2019s entrepreneurship and \ndisseminate  gender-inclusive  workplace  guidelines  for  private  sector,  developed  under  the \nprevious JFPR-funded TA (footnote 2), the project will provide training on financial literacy, \nbusiness development skills, and green jobs for about 59 informal micro, small, and medium-\nsized enterprises owned by women of Selenge aimag that operate in focus industries. To promote \nprofessional networking among civil society, the TA will (i) establish and furnish a resource hub \nin the existing NCGE Secretariat facility; and (ii) organize a speaker series among CSOs, media, \nand development partners. \n \n8.  Output 2: Implementation of subnational gender equality programs monitored and \nevaluated by local nongovernment organizations. Building on training provided under output \n1 and to increase the engagement of CSOs in the implementation of subnational gender programs, \nthe project will train about 100 selected local NGOs of 21 aimags (4\u20135 NGOs per aimag) on:13 (i) \nparticipatory  M&E  of  local  gender  equality  subprogram  implementation  and  (ii)  public \ncommunication skills to facilitate community sensitization on gender equality through regional \ntraining. A toolkit for participatory M&E of local gender subprogram implementation will be \ndeveloped for NGOs. The training programs on public communication skills will build on insights \nand knowledge products from the 2016 JFPR TA (footnote 2) tailored to specific community \nstakeholders. The project will select 15 local gender and/or women\u2019s NGOs from five aimags to \npilot participatory M&E on local gender equality subprogram implementation; the M&E results will \ninform the NGOs\u2019 recommendations to local governments. Women will be the predominant TA \nbeneficiaries, as Mongolian NGOs typically comprise a much higher percentage of women than \nmen. \n \n9.  Output 3: Gender-related knowledge products disseminated and public awareness \nraised. This output will produce focused knowledge products on a range of key gender issues. \nBased on a gender analysis of young herders\u2019 livelihoods, a workshop will be held to provide \npolicy recommendations on addressing gender issues among herders. A high-level national forum \nwill be organized to reinforce implementation of the Ulaanbaatar Declaration (footnote 1) adopted \nunder the 2016 JFPR TA (footnote 2). Further, to facilitate gender studies on climate change \nadaptation and improvement of rural women\u2019s livelihoods, up to five research proposals of \nresearchers and scholars will be funded, with findings presented to the national symposium. To \nsensitize the public regarding gender stereotypes, innovative messages (e.g., using story-telling \nvideo clips and/or podcasts, and social marketing techniques) will be produced and disseminated \nnationwide in collaboration with high-capacity NGOs, building on the gains of the JFPR TA \n(footnote 2). The TA will engage the 15 trainee NGOs (para. 8) to help them identify, design, and \nimplement  local  communication  campaigns  targeted  at  their  communities,  and  will  thereby \nincrease community-driven outreach on gender equality, and ensure NGOs are able to apply \nlessons and insights regarding public communication skills. \n \n10.  The TA will extend ADB\u2019s engagement with CSOs nationwide through focused training \nprograms and innovative, pro-poor, socially inclusive, and gender-responsive \u201clearning-by-doing\u201d \napproaches. Specifically, the 15 trainee NGOs will (i) pilot participatory M&E on the gender \nequality subprogram implementation in their aimags and (ii) design and implement communication \ncampaigns for their respective communities where the impact can be most significant. The \nparticipatory M&E toolkit developed under the TA can be replicated to other sectors and the \nremaining 16 aimags. The TA also addresses gaps and adds value to capacity building of local \nwomen entrepreneurs. \n                                                \n13 Selection criteria will include (i) expertise on social, gender, human rights, and development issues; (ii) at least 2 \nyears of continuous practical experience; and (iii) prior experience working with local government. \n ", "4 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $530,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby the JFPR and administered by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. The \ngovernment will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff remuneration, office \naccommodation for project implementation unit staff, meeting venues, operation and maintenance \ncosts of the resource hub, logistics and administrative support of workshops and training, and \nother in-kind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  ADB will implement the TA from 1 August 2019 to 1 August 2021. The NCGE Secretariat \nwill be the executing and implementing agency. The NCGE Secretariat will form and chair a \nsteering committee to guide the TA, composed of senior officials from relevant ministries and \nagencies. The TA  coordinator  will  act  as  a  secretary  to  the  steering  committee.  ADB  will \nadminister the TA and be responsible for the recruitment and contracting of all consultants in \ncoordination with the executing agency (EA). \n \n13.  To facilitate TA implementation, ADB will establish a separate advance payment facility \nwith the NCGE Secretariat in a commercial bank in local currency (togrog) in coordination with \nthe Ministry of Finance following ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). This will be used to support cash expenditures for workshops, \ntraining programs, conferences, and publications; local travel costs of the EA staff; and other \nmiscellaneous administration and support costs with prior agreement from ADB. The TA will \nsupport local travel costs of the EA staff for the facilitation of extensive trainings in rural areas, \nincluding per diems and vehicle rentals. The TA will not support ineligible expenditures following \nthe JFPR policy guidelines. The EA is assessed as having the financial management capacity \nand internal control to maintain records.14 ADB will also make certain direct payments (e.g., for \nprocurement of equipment and furniture, workshop venues).  \n \n14.

Consulting services. ADB will hire two individual consultants (a TA coordinator and a \nfinance and administrative assistant) to provide support across all three outputs. ADB will also \nengage two national consulting firms: one will focus on gender and M&E, and the other will deliver \npublic communication activities.15 Output-based terms of reference will be used to recruit the \npublic communications firm using the quality-based selection method. Interested organizations \nwill be requested to prepare a full technical proposal, including a methodology and approach to \ndeliver the outputs and determine the number of experts required to achieve the set objectives. \nADB will engage consultants in accordance with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or staff instructions. \nADB will evaluate TA progress through semiannual review missions based on the performance \ntargets and indicators defined in the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 2. \n \n16.  ADB\u2019s  procurement.  ADB  will  procure  equipment  and  furniture  following  the  ADB \nProcurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  its  associated  project \nadministration instructions and/or staff instructions. This may include office equipment, computers, \ntablets, projector, LED screen, furniture, and automated facilities. The equipment and furniture \nprocured through the TA will be turned over to the NCGE Secretariat upon TA completion. \n \n17.  Cofinancier requirements. The TA will liaise closely  with local CSOs  whose local \npresence and specialized knowledge will help in addressing gender inequalities that constrain \npoverty reduction and inclusive growth. The TA is designed with strong grassroots participatory \napproaches, given its target of civil society activists working to help the poor, vulnerable and other \nmarginalized groups, and youth not commonly involved in decision making that affects their lives. \nThe TA will be implemented following the 2018 JFPR Policy Guidelines for TA grants. \n \nIV.
