INTRODUCTION\n1.  At the request of the Government of the Philippines, a Fact-Finding Mission was fielded\nin  July  2001  to  formulate  technical  assistance  (TA)1  for  preparing  a  comprehensive  slum\nupgrading and eradication program for Metro Manila. The Mission followed a Reconnaissance\nMission undertaken during January-February 2001. The Mission held discussions with officials\nof the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC), the Department of\nFinance, National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), other Government agencies,\nlocal  government  units  (LGUs),2  the  League  of  Cities,  and  nongovernment  organizations\n(NGOs).  Understanding  was  reached  on  the  objectives,  scope,  cost  estimates,  and\nimplementation arrangements for the TA.\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2.  Rapid  urbanization  in  the  Philippines  is  seen  in  the  megacity  of  Metro  Manila,  a\nmetropolitan area comprising 17 cities and municipalities where the population has increased\nfrom under 2.5 million in 1964 to over 12 million in 2000. Metro Manila, growing at 3.3 percent\nannually, is a major economic engine of growth that contributes approximately 30 percent of the\ngross national product. At the same time, over 20 percent of the population are living either\nbelow or near the poverty line; 35 percent reside in informal slum settlements,3 many of which\nare gateways to a continuous influx of poor rural migrants. The settlements\u2019 growth and demand\nfor  services  have  overwhelmed  the  capacity  of  the  government  and  NGOs  to  effectively\nrespond. Resettlement programs that have attempted to relocate the urban poor to remote sites\naway from established sources of livelihood have generally failed.\n3.  Many urban poor communities in Metro Manila have been written off as entrenched\nslums  that  defy  solutions  for  improvement.  Major  slum  upgrading  efforts  have  not  been\nundertaken on a large scale since the 1970s. In recent years, prime urban areas have attracted\nheavy investments from private sector developers, creating pockets of relatively good urban\nplanning and design, while the Government has pursued major road and light rail projects. The\ninterface between poorer depressed informal areas and formal, developed areas is weak, and\nmunicipal  infrastructure  is  lacking.  The  majority  of  new  development  is  undertaken  in  an\nuncoordinated and unsustainable manner. Increasing urban density, growing environmental\nproblems, an unmet backlog of low-income housing, and worsening traffic congestion have\nraised serious concern over the long-term livability of Metro Manila.\n4.  Most of the LGUs in Metro Manila lack up-to-date, accurate data on their respective\nurban resource bases. Such information is crucial to urban planning; without knowledge of what\nis there and what, how fast, and in what ways it is changing, effective planning cannot be done.\nCity planning staff typically lack formal geographic or spatial analysis training, which limits\neffective land use and development planning. Computer-based geographic information systems\n(GIS) using satellite or aerial imagery, and other electronic governance initiatives, offer promise\nfor more rational urban planning and management.\n5.  Since the passage of the Local Government Code (LGC) of 1991, which has promoted\ndecentralization,  LGUs  have  been  tasked  to  take  a  lead  role  in  their  own  planning  and\n                  \n1\n The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in August 2000 (Internet edition).\n2\n Cities of Caloocan, Mandaluyong, Marikina, Muntinlupa, and Pasay.\n3\nInformal slums are blighted urban areas that lack basic municipal services and infrastructure, and are typically\ninhabited by squatters who lack tenure to the land.", "2\ndevelopment,  but  are  constrained  by  weak  capacity  and  limited  resources.  NGOs  have\nincreasingly  served  as  effective  development  partners,  and  have  supported  participatory\ndevelopment approaches that strengthen project sustainability. Despite these changes, LGUs\nare generally reactive, and allow new development to occur in an uncontrolled manner. Urban\nplanning and management systems are inadequate and accorded low priority. By choice or\ncircumstance, LGUs are unable to address slum areas, or to control the influx of new squatters.\n6.  On-site urban upgrading and integrated urban development approaches may effectively\naddress urban poverty and improve access to basic services, while avoiding complicated off-site\nresettlement schemes that are prone to failure. While available land under the control of the\nLGUs in Metro Manila is in short supply, national government land parcels have been identified\nfor privatization. Previous efforts to sell these parcels through public bidding have failed, largely\ndue to the problem of squatters. With the sale of such land, the LGC entitles the concerned LGU\nto 40 percent of the proceeds as its share in the \u201cproceeds from development and utilization of\nthe national wealth.\u201d4 LGUs are interested in receiving an in-kind proportion of these land\nparcels for on-site upgrading or as in-city relocation sites for their squatter populations.\n7.  National Government land slated for privatization include the 76-hectare Welfareville\nproperty  in  Mandaluyong,  the  450-hectare  New  Bilibid  Prison  property  in  Muntinlupa,  and\nvarious  Philippine  National  Railways  parcels  in  Caloocan,  among  others.  Utilizing  these\nremaining tracts of government land for in-city urban poor housing, integrated into a balanced\nurban development scheme, is perhaps the last chance for Metro Manila to resolve the long-\nstanding problem of slum and squatter settlements. Notably, the unrealized asset potential of\nthis urban land, or \u201cdead capital\u201d as it has been characterized, is estimated at $66.4 billion for\nMetro Manila and adjacent urban areas.5\n8.  A concerted multistakeholder effort is required to formulate and execute a policy reform\nagenda and action plan to reclaim and convert government land into value-added housing\nschemes that involve the private sector and civil society. LGUs require reliable and up-to-date\ninformation bases to design and implement urban development projects, which can be provided\nby GIS technology, and strengthened urban planning and management capacity. The TA will\naddress these requirements, and will package a subsequent loan project suitable for financing\nby the Asian Development Bank (ADB).\n9.  The TA supports the thrusts outlined in the Government\u2019s Medium-Term Development\nPlan (2001-2004), the National Housing and Urban Development Framework, and the National\nUrban Policy Agenda 2001-2004. The Government has also announced adoption of the \u201cDe\nSoto\u201d principle (footnote 5): that is, to seek equity, social justice, and broad gains in economic\ndevelopment through the unblocking of urban land markets, disposing of idle government land,\nand granting land titles to the urban poor.\n10.  The TA and the ensuing program of investment projects will support the policy reform\nagenda, and initiate a phased, multiyear slum eradication and upgrading program in support of\ndecentralization and devolution where local governments, in partnership with communities and\nthe private sector, assume responsibilities for urban upgrading, renewal, and regeneration.\nThese recommendations are supported by findings under two urban sector TAs,6 and the two\n                  \n4\nShare of Local Government Units in the National Wealth, Local Government Code of 1991 (Republic Act 7160).\n5\nDe Soto, Hernando. 2000.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objective\n11.  The TA aims to assist the Government formulate a phased, metropolitan-wide 15-year\nstrategy  for  slum  eradication  and  urban  upgrading  in  Metro  Manila,  initiate  a  process  for\nformulating LGU-level integrated urban development interventions in support of the strategy,\nincluding support for the transfer of national Government lands to local governments, and\nprepare, for possible external funding, a high-priority investment project. The TA will prepare\none project within this phased investment program for possible ADB financing. The project will\nbe relatively modest compared with the overall investment requirement to address Metro Manila\nin its entirety, but should have high impact and serve as a demonstration of achievable urban\nsector improvements. A preliminary project framework is given in Appendix 1.\n12.  The  TA  will  (i)  strengthen  metropolitan  planning  and  management;  (ii)  build  LGU\ncapacity for urban and land use planning and management, urban service provision (water\nsupply, solid waste, and sanitation), urban renewal and regeneration, and housing provision,\nwith  a  focus  on  social  equity;  (iii)  help  establish  mechanisms  to  promote  and  direct  new\ninvestment, using incentives and other innovative tools to direct and manage growth and unlock\nthe  urban  land  market;  (iv)  help  encourage  the  redevelopment  of  depressed  urban  poor\ncommunities through the creation of special districts and community revitalization zones (CRZs)\nto attract private sector investment; (v) promote sound environmental management; and (vi)\ncreate mechanisms and a framework to assist communities create community development\ncorporations (CDCs) to promote comprehensive urban revitalization programs.\n13.  The subprojects will evaluate and incorporate feasible development plans and proposals\nprepared by concerned government departments and corporations, LGUs, NGOs, community\norganizations, and the private sector. An integrated package of high-priority components in\nselected LGUs will be prepared for consideration for funding by ADB, other aid agencies, and\nthe private sector. The project aims to demonstrate what is possible by tackling well-defined\nissues on a pilot basis and with a limited, and therefore manageable, scope of activities.\nB. Scope\n14.  The TA will help prepare a 15-year strategic metropolitan-wide slum eradication and\nurban upgrading plan, and formulate a loan proposal of investments covering a 5-year time slice\nof the plan. These outputs are to be produced in phase 1 and phase 2 of TA implementation,\nrespectively. Phase 2 will primarily focus on selecting and designing at least three subprojects in\nselected LGUs, featuring innovative mechanisms, including (i) creation of targeted CRZs and (ii)\nformation  of  CDCs  as  multistakeholder  partnerships  to  oversee  community  development\ninitiatives. Subproject components will include urban poor housing; urban services (water supply\nand  sanitation);  associated  municipal  infrastructure  (flood  control,  drainage,  roads,  street\nlighting); social infrastructure (health and education); and other urban amenities.\n                  \n7\nJFPR 9003-PHI: On-Site Urban Upgrading for Vulnerable Slum Communities in Payatas, for $1,000,000, approved\non 13 December 2000; and JFPR 9004-PHI: Off-Site and Off-City Relocation for Vulnerable Slum Communities of\nMuntinlupa City, for $1,000,000, approved on 21 December 2001.", "4\n15.  The TA will (i) assess existing development plans and policies with a focus on the urban\npoor; (ii) prepare a 15-year comprehensive metropolitan-wide program for slum eradication and\nurban upgrading; (iii) prepare pilot integrated urban upgrading, renewal, and regeneration plans\nfor selected community districts in participating LGUs, using innovative tools and mechanisms;\n(iv)  propose  the  establishment  of  pilot  CDCs  in  selected  districts  to  manage  community\ndevelopment programs; (v) identify associated municipal infrastructure investments to support\nthe proposed plans; (vi) establish a GIS for land use and urban development planning and\nmanagement;  (vii)  identify  high-priority  components  for  investment,  and  prepare  technical,\neconomic, and financial feasibility studies; (viii) prepare a cost recovery and revenue generation\nplan;  (ix)  review  existing  institutional  arrangements  and  recommendations  for  an  improved\ninstitutional framework for urban planning and management; and (x) assess information and\ncommunications technology (ICT) capacity for improved urban governance and management.\n16.  The  TA  will  assist  selected  LGUs  in  piloting  comprehensive  approaches  to  urban\ndevelopment and management in model CRZs, to include urban upgrading, reblocking, infill\nhousing, densification, land readjustment, possible industrial relocation, employment generation,\nland redevelopment opportunities, and encouragement of alternative land uses on a shared,\ncommunity-driven basis in collaboration with the local government and the private sector. The\nCRZs will be anchored by high-priority municipal infrastructure projects that will strengthen\nurban  linkages  and  unlock  the  development  potential  of  long-depressed  communities.  The\nsubprojects  will  include  extensive  community  participation,  documentation,  and  sharing  of\nexperience and resources between districts; and will serve as models for further replication and\nexpansion. The project will support the overall strategic objective of ADB for poverty reduction\nby tackling well-established pockets of extreme urban poverty, and problem solving for their\nupgrading and permanent improvement.\nC. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,430,000 equivalent, comprising $758,000 in\nforeign exchange costs and $672,000 equivalent in local currency costs (Appendix 2). ADB will\nfinance $1,000,000 to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and part of the local currency cost\nequivalent to $242,000. ADB will finance the TA on a grant basis from the Asian Currency Crisis\nSupport Facility, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will provide the balance\nof the local currency cost, equivalent to $430,000, through payments in kind in the form of\ncounterpart staff, office space, furniture, administrative support services, and logistics. The\nGovernment has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any\nensuing projects.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n18.  HUDCC will be the Executing Agency for the project. A project management office will\nbe established jointly by the participating LGUs and will have a project manager, a team of\ninternational and domestic consultants, and counterpart staff with appropriate qualifications and\nexpertise.  HUDCC  will  provide  technical,  administrative,  and  logistical  support.  Subproject\noffices will be established in participating LGUs.\n19.  A project steering committee (PSC) will be formed and will meet at least bimonthly to\nprovide policy guidance and interagency coordination. The chairperson will be the Secretary of\nHUDCC;8 members will include representatives of Department of Budget and Management,\nDepartment of Environment and Natural Resources, Department of Finance, Department of\n                  \n8\n Related agencies to be represented include Home Guaranty Corporation, Housing and Land Use Regulatory\nBoard, Land Registration Authority, National Home Mortgage Finance Corporation, and National Housing Authority.", "5\nInterior  and  Local  Government,  Department  of  Justice,  Department  of  Social  Welfare  and\nDevelopment, the League of Cities, Metro Manila Development Authority, the National Anti-\nPoverty  Commission,  NEDA,  Presidential  Commission  for  Urban  Poor,  NGOs,  community\norganizations, and the private sector.9 A core group to be formed within the PSC will meet more\nfrequently.  LGU  commitment  will  be  established  through  consultations  with  city  mayors.  A\nworking committee will be formed under PSC to provide operational guidance. HUDCC will\ndesignate a coordinator to supervise and manage the TA, and will assign suitable counterpart\nstaff.\n20.  ADB will engage a team of international and domestic consultants in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The TA will require about 67 person-months of\nconsulting services: 31 international and 36 domestic. The international consultants will have\nexpertise in urban development; housing and housing finance; municipal services; GIS and land\nmanagement;  urban  environmental  management  and  training;  institutional  development;\ntaxation, property, and land use law; urban policies; private sector partnerships; and financial,\neconomic and social analyses. The domestic consultants will have expertise in urban planning,\npoverty  reduction  and  community  development;  microcredit;  financial,  environmental,  and\neconomic analyses; private sector partnerships; civil engineering; urban governance; and GIS\nand ICT. The domestic team will include at least two members drawn from NGOs actively\ninvolved  in  the  sector.  To  expedite  consultant  selection,  advance  action  to  recruit  the\nconsultants on a noncommittal basis has been approved. The outline terms of reference are in\nAppendix 3.\n21.  The TA is expected to commence in January 2002 for a period of eight months, and be\ncompleted by August 2002. Part 1 will comprise preparing a phased, metropolitan-wide 15-year\nstrategy for slum eradication and urban upgrading in Metro Manila, identifying integrated urban\ndevelopment interventions in selected LGUs in support of the strategy, and establishing a GIS\nfor rapid land use assessments and urban poverty mapping. Part 2 will prepare the Project and\npackage  high-priority  components  for  community-based  urban  upgrading  and  associated\nmunicipal infrastructure in selected LGUs, suitable for external financing.\n22.  In addition to the strategy, the consultants will prepare four reports: inception, interim,\ndraft final, and final report. Tripartite reviews will be conducted by ADB, the Government, and\nthe consultants to consider the reports. The consultants will conduct two seminar workshops for\nstakeholders to discuss the Project. The first seminar, to be conducted at the beginning of part 1\nof the TA, will present the project concept and obtain feedback and inputs for the project\npreparation stage. The second will present and discuss the project proposals in the draft final\nreport. Computers and other equipment will be procured by direct purchase in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on Procurement.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of the Philippines in an\namount not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 for the purpose of preparing the Metro\nManila Urban Services for the Poor Project, and hereby reports such action to the Board.\n                  \n9\n
