The Government of Sri Lanka intends to improve the suburban railway system in the \nColombo Metropolitan Region (CMR) including the 64 km Veyangoda\u2013Colombo Fort\u2013Panadura \nsection. This project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) will (i) assess the railway system \nin the CMR including the corridors linking to Kandy and Galle; and (ii) identify and prioritize \ninterventions such as track rehabilitation and modernization of signaling and telecommunication \nsystems, possible railway electrification and rolling stock required to increase railway operation \nand maintenance facilities. The PPTA will prepare pre-feasibility studies including cost-benefit \nanalysis to decide on the priority interventions in consultation with the government, and define \nthe scope of further projects to be prepared under the proposed technical assistance loan (TA \nloan), which will support detailed design, bid documents, safeguards documents, procurement \nand safeguards implementation. \n \nB.

Consulting Services \n4.  Sri Lanka Railway (SLR) is operating a 230-kilometer (km) railway network serving the \nCMR, comprising of four railway lines radiating from Colombo. The Main Line and the Coast \nLine are well patronized especially during peak periods. The Puttlam Line and the Kelani Valley \nLine are single-tracked and not as attractive due to low train speeds and frequencies. The \ngovernment is also planning several extensions to the suburban railway network, such as the \nline to Battaramulla. \n \n5.  The project will improve the capacity and operation speed of the railway network in the \nCMR by (i) modernizing and upgrading track, signaling and telecommunication infrastructure; (ii) \nelectrification of the suburban railway lines, initially on the 64 km Veyangoda\u2013Colombo Fort\u2013\nPanadura section; (iii) procurement of fast and modern commuter trains. The project will be \ndesigned on a modular basis to allow future expansion of the suburban electric network e.g. to \nthe Puttlam Line and Colombo Airport or the Kelani Valley Line and to Battaramulla, expansion \nof  the  capacity  of  the  railway  lines  by  additional  tracks  to  accommodate  freight  trains  to \nColombo Port and a regional express network towards e.g. Galle and Kandy. \n \n6.  An international consulting firm will be recruited by ADB using the quality and cost-based \nselection method with full technical proposal and a quality to cost ratio of 90:10 due to the \nspecialized technical requirements and the nature of this project as a multidisciplinary railway \nproject. The consultants will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \n \nTable A3.3: Summary of Consulting Services Requirement \nInternational  National \nName of Positions  Person-months  Name of Positions  Person-months \nRail Transport Planner (TL)  6  Transport Planner (Dty.
