THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) \nTourism  Infrastructure  for  Inclusive  Growth  Project.1 This  is  one  of  three  complementary \nprojects for the participating GMS countries; others are proposed for Cambodia and Viet Nam. 2 \n \n2.  The project will remove physical and capacity constraints impeding tourism development \nin Champassak, Khammouane, Luangprabang, and Oudomxay\u2014four provinces situated astride \nthe GMS Central Corridor. It will contribute to the creation of 27,000 tourism-related jobs in the \nLao PDR by: (i) paving 70 kilometers (km) of rural roads to open new areas for private tourism \ninvestment and improve access to markets and social services for 15,000 people; (ii) improving \nenvironmental services in areas important for cross-border tourism to reduce public health \nhazards  for  35,000  residents  and  2.4  million  annual  visitors,  beginning  in  2019;  and  (iii) \nfacilitating business support services for at least 500 small and medium-sized enterprises.3 The \nproject will strengthen regional cooperation and integration by implementing regional tourism \nstandards, promoting multicountry tour circuits, and supporting structured policy dialogue to \nreduce nonphysical barriers to travel. The project investment plan is in line with the GMS \nTourism Sector Strategy,4 and the government\u2019s National Tourism Strategy, 2012\u20132020.5 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Regional context. Among country groupings in Asia and the Pacific, the GMS has a \nstrong comparative advantage in tourism as a result of its diverse cultural and natural assets, \ngood  international  air  and  land  transport  connections  between  gateway  destinations,  and \nsurging demand for intraregional leisure travel. International tourist arrivals are growing by \n12.4% per year; in 2012 arrivals reached an all-time high of 44.8 million, and generated $44.3 \nbillion in receipts. Tourism supports 7 million jobs and creates positive economic impacts in \nother service and productive sectors. About one-third of international arrivals visit at least two \ncountries while travelling in the GMS and millions of residents cross borders each year for day \ntrips. GMS countries are eager to strengthen subregional tourism cooperation and recently \nreaffirmed  their  commitment  to  promote  cross-border  tourism  under  the  GMS  Economic \nCooperation  Program  Strategic  Framework,  2012\u20132022.6 Nevertheless,  underinvestment  in \npublic infrastructure beyond the major gateways remains a critical constraint that restrains \nexpansion of private tourism enterprises and dispersal of benefits to less-developed areas.7 \n \n4.  National priorities. The Lao PDR received 3.33 million international tourists in 2012, a \n22% increase over 2011, but accounting for less than 8% of GMS arrivals. Travel and tourism \ncontribute 5.3% of gross domestic product and support 134,000 jobs, equal to 4.5% of total \nemployment.8 The government\u2019s National Tourism Strategy is consistent with the GMS Tourism \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance.

The  estimated  cost \nto implement the strategy is $430 million, of which 83% is earmarked for infrastructure. \n5  Ministry of Information, Culture and Tourism, Lao PDR. 2012.

Travel and Tourism Economic Impact 2013: Laos. London. ", "2 \nSector Strategy, which prioritizes transport and urban infrastructure upgrades, education and \ntraining, and policy enhancements to improve the business enabling environment. The 2005 \nTourism Law provides the legal basis for the strategy, setting out the parameters for creation of \na  sustainable  tourism  industry  that  contributes  to  national  development  and  strengthens \ninternational cooperation. Strategic objectives are to: (i) generate employment and income for \nlocal  people,  (ii)  strengthen  tourism  destination  management,  (iii)  expand  public\u2013private \ncooperation in tourism, and (iv) diversify tourism products and services. The estimated cost of \nthe government\u2019s investment program for tourism between 2011 and 2015 is $118 million. \n \n5.  Key issues. Although the Lao PDR has many cultural and natural tourist attractions with \ngood development potential, tourism is highly concentrated in Vientiane Capital, which accounts \nfor 43% of international arrivals and 47% of hospitality investment. Women comprise about half \nof  tourism  workers;  however,  many  are  employed  in  low-skill,  low-wage  jobs,  and  are \nunderrepresented  in  tourism  management.  The  key  impediments  to  more  inclusive  and \ngeographically dispersed growth are insufficient last-mile transport infrastructure in secondary \ndestinations; weak market linkages between the tourism industry and other economic sectors; \nand  limited  institutional  capacity  to  promote  local  tourism-related  enterprise  development. \nConsequently, at least 40% of tourism receipts leave the country in the form of tourism-related \nimports. Inadequate environmental infrastructure and low service standards suppress tourist \nlength of stay, spending, and yield, resulting in average receipts per visitor of about $154\uf0bethe \nlowest in the GMS and much less than the benchmark of $1,390 in Asia and the Pacific.9 \n \n6.  To  remove  these  constraints  and  engender  a  more  equitable  pattern  of  tourism \ndevelopment, the project will upgrade access roads that link rural tourist attractions with urban \ncenters, improve environmental services in areas important for tourism, and support training and \ncapacity building for destination management organizations and local entrepreneurs.10  Project \ninvestments are designed to catalyze additional private investment in tourism superstructure \nand services, boost tourist spending and related job creation in underdeveloped areas, and \nensure that tourism growth is environmentally and socially sustainable.11 \n \n7.  Related policies and strategies. The project is consistent with the Lao PDR\u2019s Seventh \nNational Socioeconomic Development Plan, 2011\u20132015, which aims to promote sustainable \neconomic growth and reduce poverty and inequality. Project outputs will contribute to economic \ndiversification and human resource development, and strengthen the participation of women \nand ethnic groups in national development. The emphasis on improving connectivity between \nurban and rural areas, strengthening value chains linked to the rapidly growing tourism sector, \nand creating jobs for unskilled and semiskilled workers is closely aligned with the overarching \nobjectives  of  the  ADB\u2019s  Lao  PDR  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132016:  inclusive  and \nsustainable economic growth and poverty reduction.12 The project reinforces regional efforts to \nincrease cross-border investment flows and develop the GMS corridors into economic corridors.  \n \n8.  Development  coordination.  The  GMS  Tourism  Working  Group  is  the  forum  for \ncoordinating regional tourism sector assistance. Senior GMS tourism officials and ADB co-chair \nsemiannual  working  group  meetings  to  guide  implementation  of  the  GMS  Tourism  Sector \nStrategy and identify policy issues for elevation to the annual GMS tourism ministers meeting \nand the triennial GMS summit. In the Lao PDR, sector coordination is led by the Ministry of \n                                                \n9  United Nations World Tourism Organization. 2013. UNWTO Tourism Highlights.

Other development partners engaged in tourism are \nGerman  development  cooperation  through  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Internationale \nZusammenarbeit, the International Trade Center, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, \nthe Lux-Development, the New Zealand Aid Programme, Swisscontact, the World Wildlife Fund, \nand the Wildlife Conservation Society.13 The Pacific Asia Travel Association is the leading \nindustry  group  with  over  1,100  members  and  an  active  chapter  in  the  Lao  PDR.  Parallel \nfinancing opportunities will be actively sought during implementation. \n \n9.  Lessons.  ADB\u2019s  GMS  tourism  sector  assistance  program  and  completed  tourism \nprojects in the Lao PDR are rated successful.14 Lessons from past projects include the need to \n(i) analyze tourism demand in project areas to guide selection of infrastructure investments, (ii) \nimprove cross-sector coordination and build synergies with other ADB assistance, (iii) provide \ncapacity building for project management and operation and maintenance (O&M), and (iv) \npromote  tourism-related  private  enterprise  development  alongside  infrastructure  to  expand \nincome-generating opportunities for local residents. Applying these lessons, the project has \nselected  relevant  infrastructure  subprojects  based  on  robust  market  analysis,15 as  well  as \ncomplementarities with other ADB and development partner assistance for urban development, \nwater  supply  and  sanitation,  vocational  training,  and tourism.  Capacity  building for  entities \nresponsible for infrastructure O&M, and parallel support for small enterprises led by women and \nethnic groups, will enhance the sustainability of project outputs and ensure benefits reach \nvulnerable groups. The project has deliberately selected infrastructure and capacity-building \ninterventions that will connect lower-income groups to basic services and markets and enable \nthem to access tourism employment, education, health care, and other opportunities. \n \n10.  Special features. The project will (i) strengthen collaboration between government, the \nprivate sector, civil society, and local communities to improve tourism destination management; \n(ii) demonstrate how tourist entry fees and charges can help finance the maintenance of public \ngoods such as heritage sites, roads, and environmental services; (iii) strengthen knowledge \npartnerships  among  GMS  and  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  members;  and  (iv) \nleverage service sector opportunities to accelerate widening of the GMS corridors into economic \ncorridors by linking secondary tourism destinations with increasingly affluent regional markets. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the project will be increased tourism employment for people living in \nunderdeveloped segments of the GMS Central Corridor. The outcome will be increased tourism \nreceipts in Champassak, Khammouane, Luangprabang, and Oudomxay. By 2019, aggregate \nannual tourism receipts in the project provinces will increase to $330 million, helping to stimulate \nthe creation of 27,000 additional tourism-related jobs by 2025. Based on current workforce \nparticipation rates, it is expected that 50% of these jobs will be held by women. \n \nC.  Outputs \n12.  The project outputs are (i) improved last-mile tourism access infrastructure, (ii) improved \nenvironmental services in cross-border tourism centers, (iii) strengthened institutional capacity \nto promote inclusive tourism growth, and (iv) effective project implementation and knowledge \nmanagement.

All goods and civil  works will be procured following ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2013, as amended from time to time). Works valued at $1 million or above and goods valued at \n$500,000 or above will be procured through international competitive bidding. The government\u2019s \npublic  procurement  legislation  and  regulations  (as  acceptable  to  ADB)  will  be  applied  for \npackages below international competitive bidding thresholds for goods and works, which will be \nprocured  using  national  competitive  bidding.  Goods  and  works  will  be  procured  through \nshopping for packages equivalent to $100,000 and below. All  consultants will be recruited \nfollowing ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \n ", "7 \n19.  The  implementation  arrangements  are  based  on  previous  ADB  projects.19 Policy \nguidance  and  oversight  will  be  provided  by  subregional,  national,  and  provincial  steering \ncommittees that will meet at least twice per year. Development partners, the Pacific Asia Travel \nAssociation, and members of the GMS Tourism Working Group will join steering committee \nmeetings to harmonize other tourism sector assistance. The MICT will be the executing agency \nand departments of information, culture and tourism (DICTs) will be the implementing agencies. \nOverall  project  coordination  and  regional  cooperation  activities  will  be  led  by  a  project \ncoordination unit (PCU) embedded in MICT\u2019s Tourism Development Department. The PCU will \nreport to the vice minister of MICT, who will be the permanent chairperson of the national \nsteering committee and represent the Lao PDR on the subregional steering committee. DICTs \nin each participating province will establish a project implementation unit (PIU) staffed with \nmultidisciplinary  teams  to  oversee  day  to  day  project  implementation.  PIUs  will  report  to \nprovincial vice-governors and the PCU, which will consolidate quarterly project progress reports \nfor onward submission to members of the national steering committee and ADB. The PCU and \nPIUs will share consultant resources and jointly attend all routine steering committee meetings \nto ensure project activities are well coordinated. \n \n20.  The project will work directly with community-based organizations, village development \ncommittees and business associations, which will appoint local focal points to ensure good \ncoordination between the PIUs and project beneficiaries. If no community-based organizations \nor business associations exist in project areas, the PIUs will extend assistance to form them. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n21.  The project will upgrade rural roads and ferry terminals to facilitate access to tourist \nattractions; improve waste management and public sanitation at tourist sites; and construct \npublic tourism amenities such as information centers and markets to create favorable conditions \nfor  enterprise  development  by  local  residents,  particularly  women  and  ethnic  groups. \nEngineering solutions are technically feasible and consider cost, durability, affordability, and \nclimate resilience.20 All civil works designs are compatible with standard parameters and the \nO&M  capacity  of  local  authorities.  Contract  packaging  will  attract  contractors  with  suitable \nqualifications  and  ensure  efficient  procurement.  Capacity-building  programs  will  help  small \nentrepreneurs to become more competitive and improve the business enabling environment. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n22.  An economic analysis was conducted for all infrastructure subprojects following ADB \nguidelines.21 Quantified benefits are (i) increased tourism receipts arising from an increase in \ntourists  visiting  project-supported  destinations  and  staying  0.4\u20131.1  days  longer;  (ii)  vehicle \noperating cost savings from reductions in road roughness; and (iii) for the Chom Ong Cave \naccess road improvement subproject, a combination of tourism benefits, vehicle operating cost \nsavings, and increased income for farmers that will arise from increased agricultural production. \nThe  base  case  results  indicate  all  subprojects  are  economically  viable  with  an  estimated \neconomic internal rate of return exceeding the assumed economic opportunity cost of capital of \n12%. Returns range from 13.0% for Chom Ong Cave access improvements to 37.8% for access \n                                                \n19 ADB. 2002.

Findings of the analysis are consistent with the \npast performance of other ADB-financed public tourism infrastructure in the Lao PDR; when \nsimilar assumptions were applied, the infrastructure generated internal rates of return of 13.2%\u2013\n50.3%.22 All subprojects remain viable under adverse scenarios tested.23 \n \n23.  The  financial  analysis  followed  ADB  guidelines. 24  Road  subprojects  and  their \ncomponents were considered nonrevenue-generating, and a financial sustainability analysis of \nthe departments of public works and transport (DPWTs) that will be responsible for O&M was \ntherefore completed. Based on historical revenue and expenditure statements, the analysis \nfound  that  Khammouane  and  Luangprabang  DPWTs  will  have  sufficient  funds  to  cover \nincremental O&M, but Oudomxay DPWT will require additional funds for periodic maintenance \nof the Chom Ong Cave access road. The government has committed to provide sufficient funds \nfor this purpose through an assurance in the loan agreement. A separate analysis for small \ninfrastructure under the responsibility of DICTs found that revenue from tourist user fees will be \nsufficient to cover O&M costs of all facilities developed by the project.25 \n \nC.  Governance \n24.  An assessment of the executing and implementing agencies\u2019 capacity to undertake \nprocurement and financial management envisaged under the project, including the use of the \nstatement  of  expenditure  and  imprest  fund  procedures,  suggests  the  implementation \narrangements and internal control systems are suitable.26 Measures to mitigate risks identified\u2014\nsuch as the potential for corruption from weak procurement oversight and the shortage of \nfinancial management skills\u2014will be addressed by applying standard ADB bidding documents \nand embedding consultants in the PCU and PIU to provide on-the-job training and help prepare \na project-specific financial management manual. While incumbent MICT staff members have \nexperience  with  ADB  guidelines,  all  counterparts  will  receive  additional  training  to  ensure \nprocurement, financial management, and disbursement are undertaken following procedures \nacceptable to ADB. Compliance with ADB\u2019s financial reporting and external audit requirements \nwill be monitored by review missions and normal project supervision. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and \nMICT. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n25.   The  project  will  benefit  about  200,000  people  in  the  four  participating  provinces.27 \nPoverty rates in project areas are 14%\u201354%, mainly as a result of isolation, inadequate income, \nunderdeveloped  human  capital,  and  a  lack  of  enterprise  support  services.  The  project\u2019s \ncomplementary investments to improve access infrastructure and environmental services, build \ncapacity  to  strengthen  tourism  management,  and  provide  small  enterprises  with  business \nsupport  services  are  designed  to  overcome  these  constraints  and  expand  economic \nopportunities to benefit poor and low-income households. The project is categorized effective \ngender mainstreaming. It will improve women\u2019s access to economic opportunities and social \n                                                \n22 ADB. 2011.

A gender action plan has been prepared specifying women will hold 50% of the \ntourism-related jobs created by the project and comprise 50% of participants in community \nconsultations  and  training,  hold  40%  of  leadership  positions  in  destination  management \norganizations, and comprise 30% of project management and technical staff.28 The project will \nreduce  the  vulnerability  of  women  and  children  to  human  trafficking  and  other  forms  of \nexploitation by implementing awareness-raising programs and promoting collaboration between \nprivate enterprises, nongovernment organizations, and law enforcement agencies. 29 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n26.  All safeguards documents were prepared following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009) and are posted on the ADB website in compliance with disclosure requirements.30 The \nsafeguards categorization for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples is \nB.  Initial  consultations  with  residents,  government  officials,  and  civil  society  confirm  broad \nsupport for the project. Consultation with these groups will continue throughout the project cycle \nfollowing the consultation and participation plan and stakeholder communications strategy in the \nPAM. The project includes resources to assist counterparts effectively implement social and \nenvironmental  safeguards.  Monitoring  requirements  and  appropriate  grievance  redress \nmechanisms are in the safeguards documents. \n \n27.  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  prepared  for  the  project\u2019s  area  of \ninfluence,  based  on  current  information.  The  potential  environmental  impacts  are  not \nirreversible,  diverse,  or  unprecedented.  Expected  impacts  and  risks  are  site  specific,  with \nappropriate  mitigating  measures  in  subproject-specific  environmental  management  plans \n(EMPs). Works in sensitive environments such as caves and near physical cultural resources \nwere designed in consultation with DICTs, following international good practice and national \nlaws  and  regulations.  Infrastructure  subprojects falling  within  the  boundaries  of  the  United \nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization World Heritage Site in Luangprabang \nwill be consistent with the current safeguarding and enhancement plan. The IEE and EMPs will \nbe updated and finalized at the detailed design stage with involvement of cave experts and \ncultural  heritage  specialists.  Updated  versions  of  the  documents  will  be  cleared  by  the \ngovernment and ADB, posted to the ADB website, and form part of bidding documents. The \nfinal IEE and EMPs will guide construction supervision and the preparation of site management \nplans with environmentally sensitive O&M guidelines. \n \n28.  The project will have minor LAR impacts, involving no physical dislocation of affected \npersons. Resettlement plans were prepared for each subproject with LAR, commensurate with \nthe extent and degree of the expected impacts. Improvement of the access road and ferry \nterminal in Chomphet District will cause temporary disruption of 21 businesses and require \npartial dismantling of nonresidential structures. The upgrading of the 54 km rural road to Chom \nOng Cave will require minor land acquisition from six households. Road upgrades to Xang Cave \nwill result in minor loss of garden areas and trees of three households. Initial costs of land \nacquisition and compensation are estimated at $53,000. This amount is considered adequate \nbased on the census and inventory of losses prepared in consultation with affected persons. \nProject information was disclosed to all affected persons and a cutoff date for their inclusion in \nthe  resettlement  plans  was  established  during  resettlement  consultations.  The  project \ninformation booklet will be updated and disseminated during the detailed measurement survey.  \n                                                \n28 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 The project will collaborate with the Child Safe Tourism Campaign in cooperation with World Vision, the United \nNations Office on Drugs and Crime, and Interpol. \n30 ADB. 2011.

An indigenous peoples plan (IPP) has been prepared in consultation with Khmu, Hmong, \nand Makong ethnic groups living in project areas. The project will benefit these groups by (i) \nformalizing community management of tourist attractions in ancestral territories, (ii) promoting \ncultural industries to create income-generating opportunities, and (iii) improving physical access \nmarkets and social services. The IPP specifies that indigenous peoples will be represented in \ntourism destination management organizations and includes measures to protect intangible \ncultural resources. The IPP and resettlement plans will be updated and finalized at the detailed \ndesign stage, cleared by the government and ADB, and posted to the ADB website. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n30.  The overall risk for the project is assessed as low and the benefits and impacts are \nexpected to outweigh the costs.
