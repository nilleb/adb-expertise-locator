INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the 2007 Country Programming Mission and the water financing conferences \nheld September 2006 in Manila and March 2007 in Hanoi, the Government of the Socialist \nRepublic of Viet Nam requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for assistance to prepare \nthe Ho Chi Minh City Water Supply Project. Viet Nam is one of the five target countries for \nADB's water financing program, which aims to double ADB lending in the water and sanitation \nsector by 2010. The proposed Project addresses provision of a sustainable supply of potable \nwater  for  Ho  Chi  Minh  City.  The  Project  is  directly  linked  to  the  agenda  of  supporting \ninfrastructure development and public\u2013private partnerships in infrastructure, as set out in the \nCountry Strategy and Program (2007\u20132010). The Project contributes to Goal 7 of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, to \"Ensure environmental sustainability\", and specifically to Target 10: \n\u201cHalve by 2015 the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and \nbasic sanitation.\u201d, and to the corresponding Viet Nam Development Goals. \n2.  An ADB mission visited Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) in May 2007 to undertake fact-finding \nfor a project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) for the proposed Project. Agreement was \nreached on the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, and financing \narrangements for the PPTA. The design and monitoring framework for the PPTA1 is provided in \nAppendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  HCMC is Viet Nam\u2019s largest city, and its most important commercial and industrial center. \nIts population of 7.9 million is growing at about 2.1% per annum, and is likely to reach 13.5 \nmillion in 2020. While Viet Nam\u2019s economy is growing at more than 8% per annum, HCMC\u2019s \neconomy is growing substantially faster, at around 12% per annum. This growth rate is placing \nvery serious strains on the city\u2019s already inadequate infrastructure, and not least on its water \nsupply system. \n4.  In response, the HCMC People\u2019s Committee is preparing a master plan for the HCMC \nwater system up to 2025. This provides for an increase in urban water supply coverage (from \nthe present 76% of the city\u2019s population to 100%), corresponding to an increase in capacity from \n1.2 million cubic meters per day (cmd) to 3.2 million cmd of treated water. Based on this \ndevelopment  plan,  the  World  Bank  has  financed  a  feasibility  study  on  nonrevenue  water \n(NRW),2 which divides the city water supply network into six hydraulic zones and about 500 \ndistrict metered-areas (DMAs), and proposes to reduce actual water losses in two of the six \nzones.3 The Government of France has financed a pilot project to determine the components \nand characteristics of water losses in the city's An Dien\u2013An Phu area.  \n5.  Two large wastewater projects are currently being implemented in HCMC, financed by \nthe Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC)4 and the World Bank.5 These projects \naddress the difficulties faced by the city as a result of sharp increases in the volume of industrial \neffluent and domestic wastewater, which stems from rapid industrialization and urbanization in \nthe absence of investment in wastewater treatment plants or rehabilitation of the city's 30-year \nold sewer network. The JBIC-financed project will increase the city\u2019s sanitation coverage and \ntreatment capacity to over 60% by providing wastewater treatment plants with 470,000 cmd \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 4 December 2007. \n2  NRW represents all the water produced that is not sold. \n3  This corresponds to a total of about 200 DMAs in zone 1 and zone 2. \n4  The Second Ho Chi Minh City Water Environment Improvement Project. \n5  The World Bank also implemented the HCMC Environmental Sanitation Project. \n ", "2   \ncapacity,  sewer  interceptors,  combined  sewers,  and  pumping  stations.  The  World  Bank-\nsupported wastewater treatment project covers about half of the city center or about 25% of \nHCMC\u2019s population. \n6.  HCMC\u2019s  water  supply  operations  are  managed  by  the  Saigon  Water  Corporation \n(SAWACO), which was established in 1874, and most recently restructured in 2005. As of end-\n2006,6 SAWACO had about 3,500 staff, 2,800 of whom worked in water operations, with the \nbalance  working  in  affiliated  consulting  and  contracting  companies.  SAWACO  has  an \napproximately 3,000 kilometer (km) distribution network, with 570,000 connections. Overall, \nSAWACO has five staff per 1,000 connections, a very low and efficient ratio. SAWACO delivers \ncontinuous service with a residual chlorine test of 97%, corresponding to drinking water quality. \nThe company has annual revenues in excess of D1,000 billion (about $70 million) and an \naverage operating ratio of below one. The average water tariff per cubic meter of $0.28 is below \nthe national average, but sufficient to cover operating expenses allowing SAWACO to generate \na  positive  cashflow.  About  93%  of  the  water  production  comes  from  three  surface  water \ntreatment plants (Thu Duc, Tan Hiep and Binh An); the latter operated under a build-operate-\ntransfer (BOT) contract. The ongoing extension of the Thu Duc production plant under a build-\nown-operate  (BOO)  contract  is  structured  with  the  participation  of  the  HCMC  Urban \nInfrastructure Investment Fund (HIFU) as equity holder and mostly local currency financing. The \nremaining production comes from groundwater. \n7.  SAWACO  faces  several  challenges  in  the  areas  of  profit  generation,  financial \nmanagement, management of costs and service delivery, and institutional structure. Better tariff \nstructures7 and reduced NRW levels (currently at about 40%) need to be implemented to \nimprove the company\u2019s financial and operating performance. The company has a number of \nsubsidiary entities that need to be consolidated to maximize efficiency. Some subsidiary entities \nhave an element of private sector participation, but a more coherent plan for both strategic and \nfinancial participation by the private sector in the overall group is needed.  \n8.  Under  the  new  Water  Supply  Decree  117/2007/ND-CP  of  11  July  2007,  full  cost \nrecovery is now mandatory. SAWACO is under growing pressure to (i) improve and modernize \nits  service and  sustainably  supply  all  HCMC  residents  (i.e.,  achieve  100%  coverage)  with \npotable water by 2025, (ii) increase public\u2013private partnerships and private sector participation, \nand (iii) provide and deliver water to the city in a sustainable manner. Given these challenges, \naccessing finance for future capital expenditure from a broader base of fund providers as well \nas the capital markets will require significant reforms in the institutional structures of both \nSAWACO and related governmental bodies.  \n9.  Accordingly,  SAWACO  has  approached  ADB  to  finance  a  portion  of  its  expansion \nprogram, specifically (i) implementing a NRW management project over the four hydraulic zones \nnot covered by ongoing World Bank and other financing, including a supervisory control and \ndata  acquisition  (SCADA)  system  and  a  geographic  information  system  (GIS);  and  (ii) \nstrengthening and expanding the city transmission and primary network, including reservoirs, \npumping stations and about 90 km of pipeline of various sizes. An institutional strengthening \nprogram to be implemented as part of the ensuing project will address SAWACO\u2019s most critical \ninstitutional issues. This will be identified and prioritized as part of project preparation. The \nproposed  technical  assistance  will  focus  primarily  on  water  supply,  given  that  attempts  to \naddress HCMC\u2019s wastewater and drainage issues have already been undertaken under projects \nfunded by other donors (refer to para. 5). \n                                                 \n6  Communication from SAWACO management and extracted from Southeast Asia Water Utility Network. 2007. \nData Book of Southeast Asian Water Utilities. \n7  Water tariffs in HCMC are officially set at a level to achieve cost recovery. \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the Project will be to improve urban livability and competitiveness in \nHCMC through development of water supply infrastructure.  \n11.  The outcome of the PPTA will be the design of a project to increase the level of water \nservice by (i) extending and rehabilitating a portion of HCMC\u2019s water distribution network, \nincluding  booster  pumping  stations  and  reservoirs,  to  increase  the  coverage  and  provide \npotable water to all city residents by 2025; (ii) improving the level of service and SAWACO\u2019s \nfinancial performance by reducing NRW in four of the city\u2019s six hydraulic zones; and (iii) overall \nstrengthening of water operations in the city. An initial poverty reduction and social analysis for \nthe project is provided in Appendix 2. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The PPTA will prepare a project to be implemented in three parts, as set out below. \n(i)  Part I\u2014NRW. Based on work now being done under the World Bank-financed \nproject, this part of the PPTA will study the remaining four hydraulic zones to \nestablish  a  methodology  to  reduce  NRW.  The  NRW  component  will  be \nimplemented  through  performance  and/or  management  contracts,  for  which \nterms of reference will be prepared as part of the PPTA. SAWACO will use its \nown funds to finance the feasibility study for the GIS and SCADA systems that \nwill form part of the ensuing project. The PPTA will coordinate with the ongoing \ninformation technology projects and standards used by other agencies of the \nHCMC People's Committee to review and integrate the GIS and SCADA system \nwith the project design. \n(ii)  Part  II\u2014Strengthening  and  Expansion  of  the  Transmission  and  Primary \nNetwork. Based on the objectives set forth in the master plan, the PPTA will \nprepare  a  feasibility  study  for  strengthening  and  expanding  SAWACO\u2019s \ntransmission  and  primary  pipe  network  over  the  service  area  to  increase \ncoverage and improve the security of distribution. The project will install over 90 \nkm of pipes, for the transmission and primary distribution system, with booster \npumping stations and ancillary equipment. SAWACO will finance the secondary \ndistribution system in line with the city\u2019s master plan. The study will include a \nspecial focus on pipe material selection.  \n(iii)  Part III\u2014Planning and Institutional Strengthening. The PPTA will define a \nframework  for  public\u2013private  partnerships  and  private  sector  participation, \nespecially for the divestiture8 of SAWACO's holding company, its subsidiaries \nand  affiliated  companies.  This  task  will  include  (a)  asset  inventory  and \nmanagement; (b) a policy for water conservation through demand management; \n(c) a strategy for energy efficiency through an energy audit and a prioritized \ninvestment plan based on cost recovery, which could be included for financing as \npart of the ensuing project, and (d) a framework for optimizing the provision and \nthe delivery of water supply services during the project, and certification under \nthe International Organization for Standardization (ISO).9  \n                                                 \n8  Divesture is required under the new legislation with a recommended 30% divested to private investors. \n9   Certification under (i) ISO 9001 for all design, operation and maintenance activities, (ii) ISO 14001 for safety and \nenvironment, (iii) ISO 18001 for occupational health and safety in the operation, and (iv) the new ISO 24512 for \nthe management of drinking water utilities. \n ", "4   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The PPTA is estimated at $1,900,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis in the \namount of $1,500,000 equivalent by the Government of France and administered by ADB.10 \nSAWACO will finance $400,000 through in-kind contributions of (i) office space (for a maximum \nof 20 consultants) and access to international phone and internet (the PPTA consulting firm will \npay for communications costs), (ii) about 60 person-months of counterpart staff to support the \nPPTA, (iii) vehicles for site visits, (iv) feasibility studies for the SCADA system and GIS, and (v) \na topographic survey to confirm resettlement data and any other essential information that may \nbe identified during the TA. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA does \nnot  commit  ADB  to  finance  any  ensuing  project.  A  detailed  cost  estimate  is  provided  in \nAppendix 3. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  SAWACO  will  act  as  the  executing  agency  (EA)  for  the  PPTA  with  overall  project \nresponsibility and will establish a project management unit for day-to-day management of the \nPPTA. For the duration of the PPTA, the project management unit will be run by full-time staff \nincluding a director, an English-speaking coordinator, and two to five counterpart personnel. \nThey  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  coordination  work  with  the PPTA  consulting  firm\u2019s \npersonnel,  other  government  agencies,  and  other  stakeholders.  A  steering  committee \ncomposed of representatives from relevant agencies of the HCMC People's Committee and \nother relevant stakeholders will meet at least every 3 months to (i) review the progress of the \nPPTA, and (ii) provide strategic direction for the selection of investment proposals and related \nfinancing plans. \n15.  The PPTA will be implemented by one consulting firm (see para. 16) over 12 months \nfrom October 2008 to September 2009. Total consulting inputs will be about 130 person-months, \nconsisting of 16 international consultants for 40 person-months and 15 national consultants for \n90 person-months (including 19 person-months of unallocated national consultant services, \nwhich will facilitate policy dialogue with the central and local government, and address specific \nissues that arise during PPTA implementation). The scope of work, distributed between project \ninvestment and planning and institutional strengthening, is broadly as follows (outline terms of \nreference are provided in Appendix 4). \n  (i)  Project Investment. This task will be implemented over 9 months, to define and \nprepare  parts  I  and  II  of  the  PPTA,  including  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards and financial and economic analysis to meet ADB requirements, and \ntwo local feasibility studies to meet the Government's approval requirements. It is \nanticipated that 28 person-months of international consultant services and 73 \nperson-months of national consultant services will be required for this part. \n  (ii)  Planning and Institutional Strengthening. This task will be implemented over \nthe  duration  of  the  PPTA.  The  consultants  (about  5  person-months  of \ninternational  consultant  services  and  5  person-months  of  national  consultant \nservices) will work closely with SAWACO in defining the needs and requirement \nfor the institutional strengthening program to be implemented as part of the \nensuing project. \n                                                 \n10  Through the channel financing agreement (technical assistance program) between the Government of France \nand ADB. \n ", "  5\n16.  The consultants will be engaged by ADB as (i) an international firm in association with a \nlocal firm, recruited under fixed budget selection (FBS) through simplified technical proposals; \nand  (ii)  individual  consultants.  FBS  is  appropriate  inasmuch  as  the  TA  is  limited  to  the \nproduction of two simple feasibility studies and an institutional strengthening program with \ndetailed terms of reference, input consultant time, and deliverables clearly identified. The firm \nand the individual consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Equipment will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). All the equipment \npurchased under the PPTA will be turned over to SAWACO at the end of the Project. \n17.  The  PPTA  will  include  four  workshops  in  HCMC  at  (i)  the  inception  phase,  (ii) the \nmidterm completion of the preparation of the two investment components, (iii) the completion of \nthe feasibility studies, and (iv) following the initial development of the institutional strengthening \nprogram. The workshops will include representatives from the HCMC People\u2019s Committee, \ncentral government agencies, civil society, and the private sector. The reporting requirement will \ninclude an inception report, three progress reports and a final report. In addition, the consultants \nwill prepare two feasibility study reports for the investment components of the project (NRW and \nnetwork strengthening and expansion), and a series of reports for each of the items for the \nplanning and institutional strengthening component. All the documents produced will be in \nEnglish and in Vietnamese. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,500,000  to  the \nGovernment of Viet Nam to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of France for \npreparing the Ho Chi Minh City Water Supply Project, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources /  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nImproved urban livability  \u2022  NRW is reduced in the  Investment project completion  \u2022  The Government, \nand economic  project area   report  SAWACO and other \ncompetitiveness of HCMC  \u2022  Water supply coverage    concerned agencies sustain \ndue to better quality and  in HCMC increased  Government demographic,  best practices in water \nmore sustainable water  from 76% to 90% in  economic, health and water  supply delivery beyond \nsupply  20151  sector statistics  completion of the project. \n\u2022  Water supply service is     \ncontinuous, of drinking  Public feedback, public  Risks \nwater quality, meets  opinion surveys, citizen report  \u2022  Natural disasters or other \ndemand, and is  card  catastrophes deplete fresh \nfinancially sustainable    water resources. \nby 2015  ADB monitoring of baseline  \u2022  Factors other than water \n\u2022  Positive change in the  indicators  supply severely affect the \nperception of the level  economic situation or \nof water supply service  health of the population in \nin the project area  the project area.  \n  \u2022  Political interference \nprevents successful \nimplementation of the \ninstitutional strengthening \nprogram and threatens the \nfinancial sustainability and \ncompetitiveness of the \nwater supply system. \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nAgreed design of new  \u2022  Endorsement by  ADB PPTA completion report  \u2022  Government, SAWACO, \ninvestments to extend and  HCMC of feasibility    and other concerned \nrehabilitate the water  studies on (i)  Official reports and feedback  agencies committed to \ndistribution network,  strengthening and  from SAWACO and other  timely and successful \nreduce NRW, and an  expansion of  agencies  completion of the Project. \ninstitutional strengthening  distribution network,     \nprogram to be  and (ii) NRW, by    Risks \nimplemented during the  September 2009  Local government and water  \u2022  Differences between central \nsubsequent loan project  \u2022  HCMC and SAWACO  company policy papers  and local government, or \nagree on the content of  between local government \nproposed institutional  and SAWACO significantly \nstrengthening program,  delay approval of the \nby July 2009  feasibility study and \n\u2022  Recommended  institutional strengthening \nframeworks for the  program. \nprogram are adopted \nby HCMC and \nSAWACO by June \n2009 and initial steps \nare taken towards \nimplementation. \n \n1 \nGovernment\u2019s target is 100% supply coverage by 2025. \n \n      \n      \n ", "  Appendix 1  7 \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources /  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n1.  The Viet Nam country strategy and program, 2006\u20132009 stresses the importance of maintaining sustainable equitable \neconomic growth to achieve further reductions in poverty. Viet Nam\u2019s success in reducing the portion of the population living \nbelow the poverty line (from 70% in 1990 to 27% in 2005) was based on rapid but equitable economic growth. The \nGovernment\u2019s strategy for Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) is to develop water and sanitation infrastructure, improve service levels, \nand expand services to new urban and peri-urban areas. The proposed project is expected to reduce nonrevenue water and to \nstrengthen and expand the primary transmission network in order to improve coverage. In addition, the project will include an \ninstitutional strengthening program to assist the Saigon Water Corporation (SAWACO) improve efficiency and service. These \nmeasures will ultimately improve the quality of life, working environment, ability to attract investment into the city and access to \nservices, and will therefore help reduce poverty. The Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy will be reviewed to identify the \nimpact of such large-scale infrastructure projects on poverty reduction in Viet Nam. \n \nB.  Targeting Classification \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention    Individual or Household;  Geographic;  Non-Income MDGs  \n \n2.   Explain the basis for the targeting classification: The project will seek to improve water service delivery and expand \ncoverage in HCMC. \n \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  If the project is classified as Targeted Intervention Household, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact \nanalysis is needed? N/A \n \n2.  What resources are allocated in the PPTA/due diligence? A total of 6 person-months of international and national \nconsultant services and a provisional sum of $20,000 for the social assessment survey. \n \n3.  If General Intervention, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, \npro-poor governance, and pro-poor growth)? The water tariff structure will be pro-poor and focus on providing the urban \npoor, vulnerable and disadvantaged people access to service, and will use a citizen report card to measure the service. \n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from the \nproject? The objective of the project is to enable SAWACO to provide 100% of HCMC residents with potable water by \n2025. The project will directly benefit people living in peri-urban areas and improve the level of service to all users. The \ntariff includes a subsidized \u201clifeline\u201d of 4 cubic meters of water per person per month; this would include the connection \ncost, to promote access and the use of the service by vulnerable and disadvantage groups in HCMC. \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? The project will provide affordable and \nclean water to prospective users, such as households, industries, commerce and institutions (e.g., hospitals and public \nbuildings). \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project address \nthem? Block tariffs and access to service are known to be counterproductive with the poorest segment of the urban \npopulation. The project team will work with SAWACO and the HCMC People's Committee to incorporate the one-off \nconnection to access the service unto the water tariff. Miscellaneous programs, such as output-based aid and \"small pipe \nnetworks\" will be examined and considered for inclusion in the project. \n \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Indicate the potential initial stakeholders: Stakeholders include the water users, the water company and the local \ngovernment. \n2.  What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., workshops, \ncommunity mobilization, involvement of nongovernment organizations and community-based organizations, etc.)? \nThere will be several public consultation meetings over the course of project preparation, including four workshops, a \nresettlement town hall meeting, willingness to pay and affordability surveys, and a water tariff public consultation. The \nproject would strengthen SAWACO\u2019s customer service department, seek to address complaints from users, and \ndevelop a plan addressing communication between water companies and users. \n \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n       Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n \n4.  Will a C&P plan be prepared?    Yes          No    Please explain. A C&P plan will be prepared by the PPTA \nconsultant during the social assessment survey and focus groups discussion to seek views from the project population. \nThe C&P plan will be used in formulating a communication plan for disseminating information from water companies to \nusers, and in defining performance indicators to measure the level of service through the citizen report card. \n \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project/program? The \nconsulting firm will conduct a detailed gender assessment for the households affected by resettlement.  A gender plan \nfor addressing gender concerns in the Project related to resettlement, HIV/AIDS, safety measures, and capacity \nbuilding of the EA and relevant stakeholders will be prepared for the proposed project. The communication plan will be \ngender focused to promote and build awareness. \n \n2.  Does the proposed project/program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment by \nimproving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and participation in decision \nmaking?       Yes          No    Please explain.  \nThe project will not directly lead to women's empowerment; however, the improved services and the expansion of the \ndistribution network will benefit women through improved access to a potable water supply. \n \n3.  Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or to widen gender inequality? \n          Yes          No    Please explain.  \n       Not Applicable. \n \nIII.
