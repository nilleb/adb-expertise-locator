In 2004, the Government of Cambodia requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide technical assistance (TA) to meet priority research needs for inland fisheries. On 21\u201329 \nJuly 2004, the ADB Fact-Finding Mission visited Cambodia to formulate the TA, in line with the \nprogram of actions formalized in the poverty reduction partnership agreement between the \nGovernment and ADB  and in ADB\u2019s Tonle Sap Basin Strategy.1 The Mission reached an \nunderstanding with the Government on the goal, purpose and outputs, methodology and key \nactivities, cost and financing, implementation arrangements, and outline terms of reference for \nthe TA. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Cambodia\u2019s inland fisheries are the fourth most productive in the world in terms of total \nfreshwater fish catch.3 Given the size of Cambodia\u2019s small (but fast growing) population, the \nfisheries easily rank first in terms of per capita fish production and consumption. With rising \ndemand for high-value freshwater fish in Thailand and Viet Nam, they are also becoming a \nsignificant source of foreign exchange. And so, one can say that their contribution to income, \nemployment,  and  food  security  is  likely  higher  than  that  in  any  other  country.  However, \npopulation and development pressures coupled with poor governance and technology have \nintensified exploitation as well as habitat degradation and change, especially in the flooded \nforest. These have led to smaller average catches,4 biodiversity loss, worsening poverty for \nmany  fisher  folk  and  fish-dependent  households,  weaker  access  rights  for  the  poor,  and \nescalating conflict. Inland fisheries are now close to their maximum production and this resource \nwill not be available forever if it is not cared for, protected, and tapped in a sustainable way.5 \nWithout fish to provide protein6 and income, many people will starve. Yet, understanding of the \nmultitudinous factors that are detrimental to sustainable management of this vital resource is \nlimited and requires continuous, intensive scientific and social science research. Such research \ncan work to (i) make fish more affordable; (ii) add to the diversification of fisheries; (iii) generate \nemployment and income for fishers; (iv) create alternative livelihoods; (v) conserve and rebuild \nfish stocks; (vi) provide policy advice on management arrangements for common resources, \nfrom insights into the factors that impinge on their use; and (vii) buttress community efforts to \nmanage aquatic resources and protect biodiversity. To this end, in late 2002, the Government \nestablished  the  Inland  Fisheries  Research  and  Development  Institute  (IFREDI)  under  the \nDepartment of Fisheries (DOF) in the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries to shore up \nbold attempts at reform.7 \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003. Fighting Poverty in Cambodia: The Tonle Sap Basin Strategy. Manila. The development objectives of \nthe Tonle Sap Basin Strategy are to foster, promote, and facilitate (i) pro-poor, sustainable economic growth; \n(ii) access to assets; and (iii) management of natural resources and the environment. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 23 July 2004. \n3  Research suggests that production can exceed 400,000 tons per year. \n4  Research shows that the share of larger species in the total catch volume is in sharp decline. The catch of \nmedium-sized fish is showing a decrease. \n5  In the broader context of the lower Mekong River Basin, the fish habitat of the Tonle Sap is of paramount \nimportance. Many fish spend part of their life cycle in the biologically rich and sheltered flooded forest. Through \nlongitudinal migrations, they are linked with fishing grounds in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and the \nMekong delta in Viet Nam. In this sense, local fisheries operations have regional externalities. \n6  Fish accounts for more than 75% of the Cambodian population\u2019s animal protein intake. \n7  These include, for instance, the release of 56% of the commercial fishing lots to communities in October 2000. In \nJune 2004, a new Fisheries Law was formulated with ADB assistance and submitted to the National Assembly, \nwith an accompanying subdecree on community fisheries. \n ", "2 \n3.  In 2003, ADB extended TA for capacity building of IFREDI.8 The TA aimed to kick-start \nIFREDI as an efficient, effective, and relevant research and development institute. It resulted in \nmuch-enhanced, if not newly created, indigenous capacity for institute management, research \nand development, technology transfer,9 and policy development and dialogue. IFREDI is now \nfunctional: it is equipped with a full set of financial and administrative manuals and a human \nresource management plan. It knows how to draw annual operational and medium-term plans \nthat  prioritize  research  agenda.  It  is  capable  of  designing  and  carrying  out  research  in \nbioecology and socioeconomics. Its staffs face the future with more confidence than a year ago. \nIt can also, to a lesser degree, transfer technology, develop policy, and conduct policy dialogue. \nThe TA's outputs were accomplished through on-the-job training, learning-by-doing, and formal \ntraining courses. \n \n4.  IFREDI\u2019s capacity must be built further. Above all, greater efforts are necessary in the \nareas of technology transfer10 and policy development and dialogue to maximize outreach of \nresearch  findings.  Clear-cut  partnership  arrangements  with  appropriate  institutions  should \nfacilitate this. At the same time, IFREDI staff need to hone and practice their research skills to \nremain current and continue to feed policy development, particularly regarding bioecology and \nsocioeconomics. Last but not least, early exploration of what governance structure can best \nsustain IFREDI as an efficient, effective, and relevant research and development institute is \ndesirable. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n5.  The goal of the TA is sustainable management and conservation of natural resources \nand biodiversity in the Tonle Sap Basin. Its purpose is to build further the skills and awareness \nof IFREDI staff to disseminate research findings. The TA will complement the suite of loan and \nTA projects that ADB promotes under the Tonle Sap Initiative.11 Three accomplishments will \nachieve the TA's purpose: technology transfer will be accelerated, research and development \nwill be upheld, and policy development and dialogue will be galvanized. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n6.  Technology Transfer. The success of IFREDI hinges on its ability to develop and \ndisseminate research findings to policy makers, fisher folk, fish farmers, fish workers, women, \ntraders, and other key stakeholders. Building on the 2 year operational plan for technology \ntransfer and sets of information dissemination strategies designed under the earlier TA, key \nactivities will include (i) building technology transfer capabilities by running specialized training \nin information dissemination for IFREDI staff; (ii) designing and speeding up dissemination of \nmaterials;  (iii)  promoting  and  concluding  partnership  arrangements  with  four  research  and \ndevelopment institutes; and (iv) elucidating and recommending the governance structure that \nwill guide IFREDI most efficiently and effectively toward professionalism and excellence. \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Capacity Building of the Inland Fisheries \nResearch and Development Institute. Manila. (TA 4025\u2013CAM.) \n9  \"Technology transfer\" means the diffusion of research findings. \n10 Additional outputs from the TA were a 2 year operational plan for technology transfer, sets of information \ndissemination strategies, and a web site at http://www.ifredi.org/index.html. The first two outputs must now be \nacted upon. The third requires updating. \n11 The Tonle Sap Initiative is a partnership of organizations and people working to meet the poverty-environment \nchallenge of the Tonle Sap. \n ", "    3 \n7.  Research and Development. To present more objective bases for choosing between \nmanagement options for different bioecological and socioeconomic environments, IFREDI staff \nneed  to  continually  upgrade  their  knowledge  of  the  Tonle  Sap  ecosystem,12  drawing  on \nstakeholder-focused and value-based approaches. To this end, key activities under the TA will \nfocus on acquiring, interpreting, and communicating critical bioecological and socioeconomic \nparameters, bearing in mind their sociocultural dimensions. \n(i)  Bioecology. Key activities will include (a) improving knowledge of the bioecology \nand  requirements  of  dominant  species;  (b)  analyzing  the  functional  and \necological links between fish production and the water regime and habitats of the \nTonle Sap; and (c) synthesizing key findings and making recommendations. \n(ii)  Socioeconomics. Key activities will include (a) assessing comprehensively the \neconomic and livelihoods values of inland fisheries; (b) analyzing socioeconomic \nconflicts over property rights, resource access, technology, markets, and fishing \neffort; and (c) synthesizing key policy instruments and making recommendations \nfor improving livelihoods and resource management in the Tonle Sap. \n \n8.  Policy Development and Dialogue. Policy development and dialogue must take into \naccount  critical  bioecological  and  socioeconomic  parameters.  Key  activities  will  need  to \ngalvanize  such  policy  development  and  dialogue.  Key  activities  will  include  (i)  continuing \nprovision of policy inputs to, for instance, the Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve Secretariat, the \nCambodia Development Council, the National Institute of Statistics, the Ministry of Planning, \nand the Council on Agriculture and Rural Development; (ii) assessing feedback from policy \ndialogue; and (iii) refining approaches in response to feedback. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n9.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $410,000 equivalent, comprising a foreign \nexchange cost of $300,000 and a local currency cost of $110,000 equivalent. The Government \nhas requested ADB to finance $300,000, including $250,000 in foreign exchange and $50,000 \nequivalent in local currency. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding \nprogram.  The  Government  will  finance  $60,000  equivalent  through  the  provision  of  office \naccommodation and remuneration and per diem of counterpart staffs. The WorldFish Center will \ncontribute  $50,000  in  international  resource  specialist  inputs  and  backstopping  from  its \nheadquarters. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n10.  ADB will enter into an agreement with the WorldFish Center,13 which will implement the \nTA over 6 months. The WorldFish Center is the most qualified and competent agency to provide \nthe services required based on its experience, capacity, and commitment.14 The Mekong region \nis  one  of  its  priority  regions  and  Cambodia  is  one  of  its  priority  countries.  It  has  staff  in \n                                                 \n12 The Tonle Sap ecosystem is the permanent core area of the Tonle Sap and the surrounding floodplain, within the \nboundaries constituted by the upper flood lines. It includes the Tonle Sap River, its branches, and floodplain. \n13 The WorldFish Center's legal name is the International Center for Living Aquatic Resources Management. \n14 The WorldFish Center works on inland and marine fisheries in developing countries. It researches ecosystem \ndynamics; investigates alternative management schemes; analyzes policy, economic, and institutional constraints \nin fisheries and aquatic resources management; and prioritizes and improves the productivity of key fish species. \nThis entails cooperative research with institutions in developing countries and support for information and training \nin  national  agricultural  research  systems.  In  Cambodia,  the  WorldFish  Center  has  existing  collaboration \narrangements with Department of Fisheries on issues dealing with institutional frameworks, livelihoods analysis, \nand economic valuation, with support from the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom \nand the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency. \n ", "4 \nCambodia, who conduct research in collaboration with DOF. It will expand collaboration with \nDOF and others in Cambodia under the Water and Food Challenge Program of the Consultative \nGroup on International Agricultural Research. The WorldFish Center has implemented, with a \ngood track record in output accomplishment, several ADB-supported TAs including TA 4025\u2013\nCAM (footnote 8). To complement the TA, it will backstop capacity building of IFREDI staff from \nits headquarters in Penang and advise on development of partnership arrangements between \nIFREDI and other research and development institutes. \n \n11.  TA implementation will require (i) 18 person-months of international resource specialists, \nin the fields of technology transfer, bioecology, socioeconomics, and policy development; and \n(ii) about 15 person-months of short-term domestic resource specialists, mainly in the fields of \ntechnology transfer, bioecology, socioeconomics, and policy development as the need arises, in \nconsultation with ADB. The methodology, key activities, and outline terms of reference for the \nTA  are  specific  and  clearly  identified.  Hence,  ADB's  procedures  for  simplified  technical \nproposals will be used as the basis for contract negotiation with the WorldFish Center. The \nresource  specialists  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  and  its  Borrowers,  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  technology  transfer \nspecialist will be the team leader and coordinate, supervise, and monitor their activities. He or \nshe will have primary expertise in fisheries management and secondary expertise in technology \ntransfer. He or she will have advanced leadership, managerial, and public relations skills and a \nhistory of managing for results. He or she will be familiar with the particular circumstances of the \nTonle Sap Basin. Familiarity with poverty reduction and sustainable development will also be \nrequired. The resource specialists will be based at IFREDI. Equipment will be procured in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. The staffing schedule is shown in Appendix \n3. Outline terms of reference are given in Appendix 4. \n \n12.  DOF will be the Executing Agency for the TA. DOF will assign capable and enthusiastic \ncounterpart staff for a total of 18 person-months. The counterpart staff will provide full-time \nassistance to the international resource specialists and seek to benefit to the maximum through \non-the-job training, learning-by-doing, and formal training courses. Their aim will be to become \nfully competent with and capable of delivering similar services in the fields of bioecology, \nsocioeconomics,  technology  transfer,  and  policy  development  from  TA  completion. \nMethodologies  for  this  purpose  will  be  given  by  the  WorldFish  Center.  To  facilitate  TA \nimplementation,  DOF  will  provide  logistical  support  to  the  resource  specialists  engaged, \nincluding adequately furnished office space and access to communications facilities. DOF will \nalso provide copies of relevant laws, regulations, policies, and reports to the WorldFish Center \nand  ADB,  including  drafts  of  new  regulatory  instruments.  At  the  WorldFish  Center's \nheadquarters, a project coordination office headed by the program leader, Policy Research and \nImpact Assessment Program, and including experts in bioecology, socioeconomics, technology \ntransfer, and policy development, will be established to advise on TA implementation and \ncoordinate with ADB. The cost of its operations will be borne by the WorldFish Center. At ADB, \na project officer with suitable expertise will be assigned to administer the TA and monitor the \nprogress of the work. \n \n13.  The  WorldFish  Center  will  produce  (i)  an  inception  report,  within  4  weeks  of  the \ncommencement of the TA; (ii) a midterm report, within 12 weeks; (iii) a draft final report, within \n20 weeks; and (iv) a final report detailing TA outcomes and future actions, which will take into \naccount ADB\u2019s comments on the draft final report, within 23 weeks. IFREDI will submit to ADB a \ncomprehensive completion report, within 3 months of the end of the TA. DOF will respond to a \nTA  completion  questionnaire  to  evaluate  the  TA's  outputs  and  activities,  identify  lessons \n ", "    5 \nlearned, and suggest follow-up action. The TA is expected to commence in April 2005 and to be \ncompleted by November 2005. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n14.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Cambodia  for  Capacity  Building  of  the  Inland  Fisheries  Research  and \nDevelopment Institute II, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6     Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \nPerformance Indicators  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Monitoring Mechanisms \nand Targets  And Risks \nGoal       \nSustainable management  \u2022  Fisheries research is  \u2022  Government statistics   \nand conservation of natural  catalyzed  \u2022  Research program \nresources and biodiversity  \u2022  Systems and the  publications \nin the Tonle Sap Basin  capacity for natural  \u2022  Policy statements \nresource management  \u2022  Funding for research \nare enhanced \n\u2022  Planning and \nmanagement follow \nintegrated, cross-\nsector approaches to \nthe Tonle Sap Basin \n\u2022  Stakeholders \nparticipate in decision \nmaking \n\u2022  Rural livelihoods are \nsustained and \nimproved \n\u2022  Policies and \ninstitutions are pro-\npoor \nPurpose      Assumptions \nTo build further the skills  \u2022  Capacities to  \u2022  Technical assistance  \u2022  DOF, IFREDI, and other \nand awareness of Inland  disseminate findings  (TA) framework  relevant institutions \nFisheries Research and  are strengthened by  \u2022  Final report by the  have a clear vision \nDevelopment Institute  the end of month 6  WorldFish Center  about the sector goal to \n(IFREDI) staff to  \u2022  TA completion  which the TA will \ndisseminate research  questionnaire filled out  contribute \nfindings.  by the Department of  \u2022  Trained counterpart \nFisheries (DOF)  staffs remain at IFREDI \n\u2022  TA completion report \nprepared by IFREDI \n\u2022  TA completion report \nprepared by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank \n(ADB)  \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
