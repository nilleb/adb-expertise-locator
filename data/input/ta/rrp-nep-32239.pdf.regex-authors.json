An initial environmental examination (IEE) was \nAssessment  undertaken and the summary IEE is a core appendix. \n   \nProject Description  The Project will promote sustainable urban development in the \nselected nine urban growth nodes surrounding Kathmandu Valley \nby  addressing  critical  urban  and  environmental \ninfrastructure/service improvement needs. To achieve that goal, \ntraining activities for institutional capacity building and revenue \nimprovement will first be provided for the relevant municipal staffs. \nThen, a number of capital investments in essential  urban and \nenvironmental infrastructure and facilities will be implemented. At \nthe same time, public health awareness campaigns and sanitation \neducation programs will be carried out at the community level in \nthe  participating  towns.  The  Project  will  also  provide  overall \nproject implementation assistance. \n   \nRationale  Rapid urbanization is taking place in Nepal through significant \nrural-to-urban  migration.  Population  growth  rates  in  the  58 \ndesignated urban areas, especially those in the central region, are \nas  high  as  7%  per  annum,  which  is  roughly  three  times  the \naverage  national  population  growth  rate  of  2.3%  per  annum. \nNepal\u2019s  population  density of around 600 persons per square \nkilometer of arable land, which is one of the highest in the world, \nexceeds the carrying capacity of the rural areas. As a result of the \nrapid  population  growth  in  the  urban  areas,  serious  urban \nenvironmental issues are emerging, including inadequate drinking \nwater  supply;  haphazard  disposal  of  solid  waste  and  human \nwaste,  which  is  causing  various  pollution  problems;  and \nuncontrolled urban/physical development. To date, the existing \ncentralized public administration system has failed to respond to \nthese urban management challenges. To address this institutional \nfailure,  the  Government  is  now  starting  a  serious  effort  to \ndecentralize urban management. This Project is the Government's \nfirst step in realizing this decentralization policy. The Project will \nalso address the issues of disparities between Kathmandu Valley \nand areas outside the valley, and help mitigate the increasing \ntrend  of  reverse  to  the  capital  region,  with  all  its  negative \nenvironmental and social consequences. \n   \n ", " iv \nObjectives and Scope  The Project intends to bring about sustainable urban development \nin the nine urban areas outside Kathmandu Valley by improving \nessential  urban  and  environmental  infrastructure  and  services, \nand  strengthening  the  relevant  institutions.  As  a  result  of  the \nProject, personal hygiene, environmental sanitation and overall \nquality of life are expected to improve in these areas. \n \n  The Project will have five main components: \nA.  municipal  institutional  strengthening  and  revenue \nmobilization, \nB.  provision of urban and environmental infrastructure, \nC.  provision of supplementary urban facilities, \nD.  community development, and \nE.  project implementation assistance. \nRelevant  municipal  staffs  will  first  go  through  training  for \ninstitutional  capacity  building  and  revenue  improvement  under \ncomponent A. Under component B, the Project will finance major \ninfrastructure improvements in five subsectors: \nB (i)  sanitation and wastewater management, \nB (ii)  water supply, \nB (iii)  neighborhood  road,  drainage,  and  water  supply \ndevelopment, \nB (iv)  river training, and \nB (v)  road upgrading. \nThese major infrastructure improvements are complemented by \nimprovements to supplementary urban facilities in component c, \nwhich has two subcomponents: \nC (i)  small urban community facilities, and \nC (ii)  revenue-generating urban facilities. \n  Financing  for  these  supplementary  urban  facilities,  which  are \nsmall compared with those in component B, will be carried out \nthrough  the  Town  Development  Fund  (TDF).  Public-private \npartnership  is  encouraged  for  this  component.  Under \ncomponent D,  various  health  awareness  campaigns  and \nsanitation education programs will be carried out at the community \nlevel  in  the  participating  towns.  Under  component  E,  overall \nproject implementation assistance will be provided. \n \n  Additionally, the Project will be linked to two parallel schemes. \nOne  scheme  will  promote  rural-urban  partnership,  which  will \ncontribute to poverty reduction not only in the main urban areas \nbut also in the surrounding rural areas within the municipalities. \nThe other scheme will address the solid waste management issue \nby promoting composting. Funding for the parallel schemes is \nbeing arranged separately. \n ", "  v \nCost Estimates  The  estimated  project  cost  is  $37.50  million  equivalent, \ncomprising foreign exchange costs of $12.62 million (33.7%) and \nlocal currency costs of $24.88 million equivalent (66.3%). \n   \nFinancing Plan    ($ million)   \nPercent \nSource  Foreign  Local  Total \nExchange  Currency  Cost \nAsian  12.62  17.38  30.00  80.0 \nDevelopment \nBank \nGovernment    4.40  4.40  11.7 \nProject Town/ \n  3.10  3.10  8.3 \nCommunity/ \nPrivate Sector \nParticipation \nTotal  12.62  24.88  37.50  100.0 \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of SDR22,699,000 ($30 million equivalent) from ADB's \nSpecial Funds resources will be provided. The loan will have a 32-\nyear term including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest rate \ncharge of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  Municipalities are required to provide up-front counterpart funds. \nTerms  By  relending  a  portion  of  the  ADB  loan (SDR7,285,000), the \nGovernment will provide the municipalities with some matching \ngrant funds whose amount/percentages are primarily determined \nby the subsector concerned. The Government will provide the \nbalance for the municipalities in the form of loans. The loans will \nhave an interest rate of 8% per annum with a 20-year repayment \nperiod  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years.  In  parallel,  the \nGovernment will relend a portion of the ADB loan (SDR2,562,000) \nto the TDF with an interest rate of 5% per annum with a 20-year \nrepayment period including a grace period of 5 years. The TDF \nwill onlend the funds to the municipalities with an interest rate of \n8% per annum and a 12-15 year repayment period including a \ngrace period of 3 years. The Government will bear the foreign \nexchange risk. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 March 2010 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 September 2009 \nCompletion Date \n   \n ", " vi \nImplementation  The Ministry of Physical Planning and Works (MPPW) will be the \nArrangements  Executing Agency (EA) for the Project. It will discharge its duties \nthrough  its  Department  of  Urban  Development  and  Building \nConstruction (DUDBC), which will establish a project coordination \noffice (PCO) for the Project. The nine participating municipalities \n(including one prospective municipality of Dhadingbesi) will be the \nImplementing Agencies (IAs) for the majority of the subprojects. \n  Implementation at the municipal level will be managed using one \nof two possible models: the project advisor (PA) model and the \nproject  implementation  unit  (PIU)  model.  The  PA  model  is \npreferred  by  two  municipalities  with  relatively  advanced \ninstitutional capabilities (Bharatpur and Hetauda), while the PIU \nmodel  is  preferred  by  the  remaining  six  municipalities  whose \ninstitutional capabilities are still weak. The PA model envisages \nthat the municipal administration will essentially be in charge of \nimplementation management, assisted by a PA without executive \nfunction. The PIU model envisages that a PIU will be formed and \nstaffed by the EA, and will assume the executive function for \nmanaging implementation, subject to general guidance from the \nmunicipality  concerned.  Considering  the  limited  personnel \nresources at DUDBC, from which secondment staff will be drawn \nfor PAs/PIUs, a staggered implementation schedule will be used. \n   \nExecuting Agency  MPPW \n   \nProcurement  All  procurement  under  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. Contracts for \ncivil works estimated to cost $1.0 million equivalent or more will be \ncarried  out  using  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB) \nprocedures, while those estimated to cost less than $1.0 million \nequivalent  will  be  carried  out  under  local  competitive  bidding \n(LCB)  procedures.  Goods  to  be  procured  will  preferably  be \ngrouped into packages of $500,000 equivalent or more to be \nsuitable for ICB procedures. Contracts for miscellaneous minor \ngoods estimated to cost less than $500,000 equivalent will be \nprocured through international shopping (IS) procedures. Minor \nitems estimated to cost less than $100,000 equivalent per contract \nmay be purchased directly, following proper procedures. \n   \nConsulting Services  Consulting services of 29 person-months (international) and 747 \nperson-months (domestic) are planned. All consulting services will \nbe selected and engaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants and/or other arrangements satisfactory to \nADB for engaging domestic consultants. \n   ", "  vii\nProject Benefits and  The Project will directly benefit the urban population of  about \nBeneficiaries  320,000 in the selected nine urban areas with improved personal \nhygiene, environmental sanitation, and overall quality of life. In \nparticular,  the  EIRRs  for  the  water  supply  subprojects  are \nestimated to be around 22-28%. The management and financial \ncapacities  of  the  participating  local  institutions,  including \nmunicipalities  and  prospective  water  supply  utilities  under \nmunicipal  control,  will  be  strengthened  for  sustainable  urban \ndevelopment.  Furthermore,  the  regional  integration  of  water \nsupply services for improved efficiency will be pioneered for a \ncluster of a few neighboring urban areas. Thus, the Project is \nexpected to contribute to the Government's decentralization policy \n  for better governance and improvements to the framework for \npublic-private partnership. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The main risks include the (i) limited capacities of the municipal \ngovernment  staff;  (ii)  uncertainty  regarding  continued  political \nsupport for decentralization with sufficient administrative budget \nallocation/transfer; (iii) uncertainty regarding continued municipal \nrevenue  improvement;  and  (iv)  uncertainty  regarding  the \nwillingness  of  the  local  communities  to  contribute  time, \ncounterpart funds, and other resources for project implementation. \nTo mitigate most of these risks, sufficient measures have been \nincorporated in the Project in the form of various training activities \nand community education/awareness campaigns. \n \n ", " \nKERUNG (TIBET)  KHASA (TIBET) \nLINKAGE POINT TO CHINA  LINKAGE POINT TO CHINA \nv\niii \n \n KODARI \nBIDUR  BHIMESHWOR \nMCOARMKMEETR CCEEN/TTORUE/RTIRSAMD E/  TRADE-INFOTECH \nMARKET  DHADINGBESI     TERDAUNCSA PTOIORTN    122km \nCENTRE/ \nAGRO-TRADE \nPOKHARA  BANEPA  6km  DHULIKHEL \n  70km  26km  EDTOUCUARTISIOMN  \n20km  24km HEALTH \nMUGLING  NOUBISE      St\nr\na\n157km  122km  t\ne\n  g\nMALEKHU  GALCHI  KATHMANDU  PANAUTI ic\nBUTWAELA ST-WEST HWY  MRAGAARRTTKONOE-AIUTNNR DCIAUESSNGMTT ARERYR    HVEATLALUEDYA   TMOAURRKISEMT-  CCEUNLTTURREE   TMRAAKRDAKEME/CATOL CAMEMMNAETIRR CE E   Eco\n  77 km  INDUSTRY    n\n113km  MARKET CENTRE  o\nVOCATIONAL EDUCATION  38km  m\n \nBHARATPUR  i\nc\nINTDRUASDTER Y  29km  EAST-WEST  HIGHWAY  DHALKEBAR  L\n22km  COTHOMEUMARELITRSHMC E   SIMARA  109 km  ink\n(RELIGIOUS)  BARDIBAS  a\nTRANSPORT  19km  g\ne\ns\n o\n26k m  f U\nBHAIRAWA    E\n \n  IP\nBIRG ANJ  JANAKPUR   T\no\n4km  w\nn\n2km  s\n \nSUNAULI (INDIA)  SITAMAD (INDIA) \nLINKAGE PO INT TO INDIA  RAKSAUL (INDIA)  LINKAGE PO INT TO INDIA \nLINKAGE POINT TO INDIA \nHighway \n \nRoad in Poor Condition \n \nSecondary Route \n \nPlanned Route \n \nUEIP Town \n \nNode Town \n \nFuture Agglomeration ", "  \n \n \nIX\n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Kingdom of Nepal for the Urban and Environmental Improvement Project. \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES 1 \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  To date, Nepal is still one of the least urbanized countries in Asia, with approximately \n14% of its total population of about 23 million people (Central Bureau of Statistics Preliminary \nResult of Population Census 2001) living in 58 designated urban areas. Even so, the pace of \nurbanization has increased markedly in the last two decades, with the urban population growing \nat up to 7% per annum, which is roughly three times the average national population growth rate \n(2.3% per annum). The reason for rapid urbanization is mainly the population pressure in rural \nareas: Nepal\u2019s population density of around 600 persons per square kilometer of arable land is \none of the highest in the world and exceeds the carrying capacity of the rural areas. This results \nin deforestation, environmental degradation, poverty, and, eventually, migration to urban areas. \nWhile Nepal\u2019s total population is expected to reach about 30 million by the year 2011, its urban \npopulation by then will have risen to about 6.8 million, or approximately 23% of the total \npopulation. Over the last two decades, the industry and services sector with predominantly \nurban activities has grown by an average of 6.4% per annum, which is slightly less than the \ngrowth of the urban population. In other words, urban gross domestic product per capita has \nbeen more or less stagnant. About 25% of urban-based employment is estimated to be in the \ninformal sector. \n3.  The rapid growth of the urban sector, coupled with the inability of the Government to \nkeep pace with the demand for infrastructure and services for urban population, has caused the \nemergence of a number of urban environmental issues, especially in the central region of Nepal. \nUrban land is polluted due to the absence of urban services, haphazard disposal of human \nwaste,  uncontrolled  growth,  haphazard  physical  development,  and  institutional  failure  to \nrespond to these challenges. The lack of adequate sanitation facilities often leads to pollution of \nsurface water and groundwater. Major polluting industries, such as tanneries, sugar, paper, \ncanning, cement, brewery, and pharmaceutical industries, are invariably located in or near \nurban areas and often dispose of their industrial waste, including toxic waste, to roadside drains \nand open spaces. Also, disposal of hospital waste, which can be hazardous, does not appear to \nbe properly controlled. \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n4.  Piped water supply covers only a small portion of urban residents, and the supply is \nusually not continuous but intermittent. About one in three households faces a serious water \nshortage at least once a year, and about one in six all year round. Water quantity delivered is \nmostly below 50 litres per capita per day (lcd). In addition, water quality often falls below World \nHealth Organization standards for drinking water, mainly due to bacteriological contamination \ncaused by poor sanitation facilities. Only about three quarters of the urban population have \naccess to proper sanitation facilities. On-site sanitation systems, such as septic tanks, are not a \nviable option especially for densely populated core town areas. Sewerage systems, often \ncombined with storm water drainage systems, exist in a number of urban areas; however, their \n                                                 \n1  See also Nepal Urban Development Sector Study; Water Supply, Urban Development and Housing Division. \nDecember 2001. ", "2  \ncoverage  is  limited,  and  final  treatment  of  the  sewage  is  often  inadequate, if not totally \nnonexistent. As a result, rivers in urban areas have often  practically become open sewers, \nespecially in upland towns during the dry season. In contrast, urban areas located in lowlands \noften experience health hazards during the rainy season when flooding and rising groundwater \ntables render the existing wastewater disposal systems ineffective. Overall, these deficiencies of \nurban  and  environmental  infrastructure  and  services  pose  a  serious  threat  to  health  and \nsanitation of the residents.  \n5.  To address these critical urban environmental issues,  the Government  and the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) signed a Memorandum of Understanding on 5 November 1999 to \nlaunch technical assistance (TA) with the objective of preparing a project to improve the urban \nenvironment in 6-10 towns in the central region of Nepal.2 Project preparation was then carried \nout for the nine selected towns, which are now included in the proposed Project, through \nintensive  participatory  processes  involving  municipal  officials  and  other  stakeholders.  The \nproject  framework  is  in  Appendix  1.  Minutes  of  two  key  workshops  can  be  found  in \nSupplementary Appendix A. Further, intensive workshops were conducted in each project town, \ninvolving numerous participants from outside the bureaucracy. \n6.  Nepal\u2019s Seventh Five-Year Plan (1987-1992) included some urban policy components \nfor the first time (Appendix 2). During that period, the urban institutional framework was created \nfor the Ministry of Housing and Physical Planning (now the Ministry of Physical Planning and \nWorks  [MPPW]),  Nepal  Water  Supply  Corporation  (NWSC),  Urban  Development  Training \nCentre (UDTC), and town development committees (TDC) in each municipality. During the \nEighth Five-Year Plan (1992-1997), the Town Development Fund (TDF) was established. The \nrole,  past  performance,  and  assessment  of  the  TDF  is  elaborated  in  Appendix  3.  Also, \namendments to the Town Development Act were passed. This Act, which is summarized in \nAppendix 4, enables a local body to conduct guided land development (GLD) and/or land \npooling projects. During the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1997-2002), the Local Self-Governance Act \nand the Nepal Water Supply Regulation were passed. The proposed Project, which reflects the \nGovernment's urban policies elaborated in Appendix 2, will be the first decentralized urban \ndevelopment project, except for the earlier Kathmandu Urban Development Project, which \ncovered only the capital city. \n7.  In the water supply and sanitation sector, the Government's policy emphasizes municipal \nresponsibility in line with its decentralization policy. Various principles including (i) demand-\ndriven  approach;  (ii)  importance  of  institutional  development;  (iii)  user  involvement; \n(iv) integration of water supply and sewerage in urban areas; (v) cost recovery of 50% of capital \ninvestments, which is a transitional arrangement toward full cost recovery, and 100% of O&M in \nurban areas; and (vi) importance of establishing an independent regulatory body are also \nrecommended. The policy is summarized in Appendix 5. \n8.  Until 1999, the octroi tax was the main source of urban revenue, comprising typically \nabout 65% of a municipality\u2019s own-source revenue. That tax has since been replaced by the \nlocal development tax, which is a 1.5% levy charged on all imports and distributed to the \nmunicipalities. This tax is meant to be a transitional solution only, and to be replaced by other \nlocal revenue sources including the property tax as the single most important component. \nProjections for the future financial capacity of a given municipality are therefore affected by a \nconsiderable degree of uncertainty. \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance to Nepal for Urban Environmental Improvement. Manila. ", "  3\n9.  Currently ongoing external assistance to Nepal\u2019s urban sector includes activities of the \nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) (especially in the fields of decentralization, \nsupport to private sector participation in urban development), and strengthening of rural-urban \nlinkages through its Rural-Urban Partnership Program (RUPP); the World Bank (especially \nsupport  to  private  sector  participation);  German  Agency  for  Technical  Cooperation  (GTZ) \n(support to the establishment of the TDF and through its program Urban Development Through \nLocal Efforts [UDLE]); and Danida (especially in the field of decentralization and urban self-\ngovernance). More information can be found in Appendix 6. \n10.  Major lessons learned from ADB\u2019s previous, similar projects3 in urban infrastructure \ndevelopment in Nepal are summarized as follows: \n(i)  Complex and multicomponent projects should be avoided where the executing \nagencies (EAs) have limited experience. Institutional capacities with respect to \nland  acquisition,  procurement  of  consultants,  etc.  should  be  thoroughly \nexplored, \n(ii)  All stakeholders should be fully involved in project identification and design \nfrom an early stage. In particular, water user committees (WUCs), if they are \nexpected to operate and maintain the systems, need to be established and fully \ninvolved  before  the  start  of  physical  works.  Sufficient  information  on \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and  community-based  organizations \n(CBOs)  active  in  the  project  area  should  be  gathered  to  facilitate  their \ninvolvement in the project, \n(iii)  Institutional strengthening should be given the greatest possible emphasis. Key \nstaff should be in place before board consideration,4 \n(iv)  Physical works should be tendered in relatively large packages to attract bigger \nand more experienced contractors. No contractor should  be allowed to bid for \nfurther packages before he has substantially completed his current project, \n(v)  Likewise, consulting services should be tendered in relatively large packages to \nattract bigger and more experienced consultant companies.

Objectives \n11.  The Project aims to bring about sustainable urban development in the nine urban areas \noutside Kathmandu Valley by improving essential urban and environmental infrastructure and \nservices,  and  strengthening  the  relevant  institutions.  As  a  result  of  the  Project,  personal \nhygiene, environmental sanitation, and overall quality of life are expected to improve in the nine \nareas. \n12.  The Project will help the Government carry out its policy of decentralization. The Project \nwill also address the issues of disparities between Kathmandu Valley and areas outside it, and \nthe increasing trend of migration to the capital region, with all its negative environmental and \nsocial consequences. The Project will cover nine urban areas all located in the central region of \nNepal. Three are close to Kathmandu Valley (Banepa, Dhulikhel, and Panauti), two are located \nin the uplands (Bidur and Dhadingbesi), and four are in the lowlands (inner terai; i.e., Bharatpur, \nRatnanagar, Hetauda, and Kamalamai). The populations of the nine areas range from about \n12,000  to  about  89,000.  All  the  municipalities  involved  require  substantial  institutional \nstrengthening, substantial improvements to their physical infrastructure, and emphatic efforts to \nreduce urban poverty. Since this is the first decentralized urban project for Nepal, this rather \nconservative choice of target urban areas, which are relatively close to Kathmandu, can be \njustified. The Project is, thus, expected to establish an important precedent for a series of similar \nprojects that could follow. \n13.  Currently,  Dhadingbesi  is  administratively  only  a  part  of  four  village  development \ncommittees (VDCs) but is being considered for municipality status by the consolidating few \nvillages. Because the current borrowing capacity will not allow it to undertake the envisaged \ninvestments and no effective municipal administration is in place yet, it does not appear sensible \nto  start  project  activities  in  Dhadingbesi  before  the  conversion  to  municipality  status  is \ncompleted.  Therefore,  only  limited  project  activities  are  planned  in  Dhadingbesi,  and \nimplementation will not start before a municipality is formally established. The TDF, which is \nexpected to provide financing for all the subprojects in Dhadingbesi, will start onlending only \nwhen the municipality is established. \n14.  With respect to decentralization, in addition to the strengthening of the municipalities, the \nProject is also expected to help establish financially and institutionally self-sustainable water \nsupply utilities under municipal control for the municipalities of Bharatpur, Hetauda, Banepa, \nPanauti,  and  Dhulikhel.  Furthermore,  regional  integration  of  the  water  supply  services  is \nenvisaged for Banepa, Panauti, and Dhulikhel, which are neighboring municipalities. Through ", "  5\nvarious  interventions  in  the  urban  infrastructure/services,  in  particular  in  the  water  supply \nsubsector, the Project is also expected to contribute to the improvement of the framework for \npublic-private partnership (para. 34). \nB.  Components and Outputs \n15.  The Project will comprise the following main components, A - municipal institutional \nstrengthening and revenue mobilization, B - provision of urban and environmental infrastructure, \nC - provision  of  supplementary  urban  facilities,  D - community development, and  E - project \nimplementation assistance. \n1.  Municipal  Institutional  Strengthening  and  Revenue  Mobilization \n(Component A) \n16.  Component A will cover the nine towns with a more or less uniform set of interventions, \nwhich will be implemented 1-3 years for each town. Most of the interventions are technical \ntraining, for municipal staff and will mostly be delivered by training institutions or consultants \nselected and contracted by the project coordination office (PCO). Some interventions are meant \nto raise public awareness about various urban issues and enlist political support for elected \nrepresentatives and local political leaders. Training will be delivered, as appropriate, to mayors, \ndeputy  mayors,  elected  representatives,  municipal  secretaries,  municipal  technical  staff \nincluding section and sub-section heads and senior staff, key local institutions, elected ward \nrepresentatives and staff, the private sector, and community representatives. Where possible, \ntraining will be hands-on and performance based, and linked to measurable outputs to judge \nthat required skill levels have been achieved, and to verify that the training received is actually \nbeing used on the job. With the early establishment of the project performance monitoring \nsystem (PPMS), the municipal institutional strengthening, revenue mobilization, and human \nresource department/capacity building programs will be monitored and evaluated at regular \nintervals  throughout  the  project.  Component  A  is  further  broken  down  into  three \nsubcomponents. \n17.  Subcomponent  A (i) - general  municipal  institutional  strengthening  and  support  for \nrevenue mobilization is designed to introduce new and improved urban management and \nrevenue generation procedures and practices. Depending on existing (preproject) institutional \ncapability, some project municipalities will receive all interventions included in the package, \nwhereas others will require only certain activities. Nevertheless, some activities are mandatory \nand will be given to all municipalities, irrespective of their existing institutional capacities. The \naim of this subcomponent is to raise urban management and revenue generation capability \nsuch that the municipalities will be able to prepare and implement action plans that respond to \ncritical needs. Specific training will be targeted at improving the revenue mobilization capacity of \nthe municipalities, through preparation of detailed urban mapping, house numbering programs, \nhouse tax and customer databases of various urban services, and implementing improved \ncomputerized tax and service fee collection systems. Subcomponent A (i) will include training in \nurban  management  orientation,  organization  management,  investment  planning,  improved \nbudget preparation, local area planning, improved accounting, revenue mobilization, contract \nmanagement and supervision, urban planning, O&M, customer client relations, public relations, \npublic-private partnerships, monitoring and evaluation, community mobilization, and community \nawareness. To support and encourage the implementation of action plans, the municipalities will \nidentify/select  various  small  urban  facilities  or  urban  service  activities  to  be  executed  as \nsubprojects.  These  can  be  funded  under  component  C  provision  of  supplementary  urban \nfacilities. ", "6  \n18.  Subcomponent  A (ii) - support  for  implementation  of  urban  and  environmental \ninfrastructure includes specific training and support for the successful implementation/operation \nof urban and environmental infrastructure components. It will cover the following subsectors: \nwater supply, sewerage, sanitation, roads, drainage, land development, and river training. The \ntraining modules will address, among other things, the following issues: O&M, cost recovery, \nuser groups, and public-private partnership. \n19.  Subcomponent A (iii) - support for supplementary urban facilities includes training for the \nexecution and operation of supplementary urban facilities. \n2.  Provision of Urban and Environmental Infrastructure (Component B) \n20.  The  component  will  cover  the  subsectors  of  B (i)  sanitation  and  wastewater \nmanagement;  B (ii)  water  supply;  B (iii)  neighborhood  road,  drainage,  and  water  supply \ndevelopment;  B (iv) river training; and B (v) road upgrading.  The component will constitute \napproximately 60% of the project cost, and will provide a multitude of physical facilities whose \nexact composition will vary widely from town to town. The proposed subprojects have been \nsubject to initial environmental evaluations (IEEs) and estimations of economic internal rates of \nreturn (EIRRs) and financial internal rates of return (FIRRs), where required. \n21.  To ensure that the  detailed engineering designs reflect the views of the municipalities \nand  communities,  all  design  work  will  be  carried  out  by  domestic  consultants  in  close \nconsultation  with  the  municipalities.  The  domestic  consultants  will  establish  design  (and \nsubsequently construction supervision) offices in the respective municipalities. PCO, assisted by \ntheir consultant for project implementation support, will review critical design elements and may \nhold approval of the tendering of the respective physical works contract until necessary design \nimprovements have been made. \n22.  The  sanitation  and  wastewater  management  subcomponent will provide expanded \nsewerage pipe networks and a number of simple wastewater treatment plants in nine urban \nareas.  Where  required,  the  expanded  pipe  networks  will  be  designed  for  the  combined \ncollection of rainwater and domestic wastewater (this may include wastewater from small \nnondomestic sources such as cottage industries). Otherwise, the pipe network will be designed \nto  collect  only  domestic  wastewater.  The  treatment  plants  will  be  innovative,  appropriate-\ntechnology reed bed treatment plants, in line with the least-cost and appropriate-technology \nphilosophy adopted here. The systems will be designed to give the urban poor adequate access \nto improved sanitation, and will be operated and maintained by the respective municipalities. \nThe expected benefits are public hygiene and public health improvements in the urban areas \nconcerned, and reduced pollution of groundwater and surface water in the vicinity. \n23.  The water supply subcomponent will basically cover five urban areas only, namely, the \nmunicipalities  of  Bharatpur,  Hetauda,  Banepa,  Panauti,  and  Dhulikhel,  the  latter  three  as \nbeneficiaries of a potential regionally integrated water supply system. It will involve development \nof new water sources, and construction of transmission lines, water treatment plants, reservoirs, \nand distribution networks. In particular, investments will be made so that maximum use of \nexisting facilities can be achieved. The expected benefits are public hygiene and public health \nimprovements in each urban area so served. Each scheme will be designed so that the costs for \ncapital investment and O&M can be fully recovered in a sustainable manner. As an indication of \nthe existing demand for improved piped water supply services, in Kathmandu the willingness to \npay ranges from $0.43/cubic meter (m3) (poor household; upgraded from unconnected to ", "  7\nshared  connection)  to  $0.86/m3  (non-poor  household;  already  connected).5  The  existing \nwillingness to pay in Banepa, Panauti, and Dhulikhel is expected to be roughly the same, while \nthe equivalent figure in the two inner terai towns (Bharatpur and Hetauda) must be somewhat \nlower because alternative sources of well water are available. Each scheme will be designed to \nensure that the urban poor have adequate access to improved water supply physically as well \nas financially. \n24.  The neighborhood road, drainage, and water supply development subcomponent will \npromote orderly urban expansion with plot readjustment. Areas that can accommodate the high \ndemand for urban growth will be identified. They will be developed in a proactive and orderly \nmanner using the land pooling scheme (para.  36) to avoid scattered and haphazard urban \nsprawl, driven entirely by uncoordinated individual efforts, which have become one of the main \nissues of environmental degradation in Nepal. This subcomponent will not only reduce the \nnegative environmental impact of urban expansion, but also increase the efficiency of providing \nurban infrastructure in the context of such proactive and orderly urban expansion. \n25.  The river training subcomponent will be required in three urban areas only (Bharatpur, \nHetauda,  and  Kamalamai).  It  will  comprise  embankment  protection  works  where  urban \nsettlements or valuable agricultural land are threatened by erosion or abrasion. \n26.  Activities in the road upgrading subcomponent will be limited to surface improvements of \nexisting roads (excluding realignment, straightening, and widening) so that no land acquisition \nand resettlement issues will arise and the associated negative environmental impact will be \nvirtually nil. \n3.  Provision of Supplementary Urban Facilities (Component C) \n27.  Component C will provide C (i) small urban community facilities, and C (ii) revenue-\ngenerating urban facilities, whose composition and cost will vary widely from town to town. As \nthese urban facilities are still small compared with those in component B, funding will be \nchanneled through the TDF, which was established in 1989 to facilitate financing of urban \ninfrastructure projects in municipalities or urbanizing villages. The TDF is authorized to receive \ngrant and loan funds from the Government and other organizations, foreign Governments, and \ninternational agencies for its programs. It provides grants and loans to any institution engaged in \ntown development including government and nongovernment institutions, user groups, VDCs, \nand municipalities according to its investment policies and procedures. The urban facilities to be \nprovided under this component will be identified with intensive community participation during \nimplementation (Appendix 3). Detailed engineering design and construction supervision for \nsubprojects under this component will be carried out by the same domestic consultants from the \ndesign and construction supervision office to be established in each municipality. \n28.  Small urban community facilities will include public toilets, public waste collection points, \nimprovements to public places and to places of worship, improvements to neighborhood lanes, \nsports grounds, and small public recreation parks. \n29.  Revenue-generating  urban  facilities  will  be  established  mostly  with  private  sector \nparticipation  and  will  include  bus  terminals,  bus/truck  parks,  marketplaces,  small \nslaughterhouses, cold storage facilities, recreational facilities, and vocational training centers. \n30.  Dhadingbesi  is  currently  only  a  part  of  four  VDCs  administratively  but  it  is  being \nconsidered for municipality status through the consolidation of a few villages. For this reason, \nfund channeling to Dhadingbesi under the Project will be all through the TDF instead of directly \nfrom the Ministry of Finance (MOF) under a subsidiary loan agreement. The TDF is not \n                                                 \n5  RTI study: Willingness to Pay for Improved Water Supply in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal, August 2001. ", "8  \nexpected  to  start  its  onlending  for  any  of  the  subprojects  in  Dhadingbesi,  under  both \ncomponents B and C, until a municipality has formally been established. \n4.  Community Development (Component D) \n31.  Ccomponent D will consist mainly of public health awareness campaigns and education \nprograms, in particular targeting women. These campaigns and programs will be implemented \nmore or less uniformly in all urban areas so as to mobilize the local communities. Local NGOs \nwill be contracted to implement them. The component consists of D (i) mass communication and \ndemonstration of public health awareness campaigns involving the production of materials such \nas posters, folders, leaflets, storybooks, and spots on the local radio and TV; D (ii) public health \neducation programs confined to the community under the responsibility of the Community \nDevelopment Subsection of the Environment and Community Development Section; and D (iii) \nschool  public  health  education  programs  confined  to  the  urban  school  system  where \nrehabilitation and construction of school sanitation facilities will be undertaken under the Project. \n32.  In Component D, the project town staff, representatives of CBOs, and women's groups \n(WGs) to be formed will be trained to undertake educational functions for the community in the \nareas  of  public  health.  Each  project  town  will  have  an  Environment  and  Community \nDevelopment Section, with overall responsibility for public health awareness campaigns and \neducation programs. This section, in turn, will direct the Community Development Subsection to \norganize the community and conduct these campaigns and programs in close collaboration with \nthe ward committees (WCs),6 NGOs, WGs, and representative leaders of the community. The \nrepresentative leaders will function as an important link between the community, Environment \nand  Community  Development  Section,  and  WCs.  More  details  on  social  strategy  are  in \nAppendix 7. \n5.  Project Implementation Assistance (Component E) \n33.  Component  E  comprises  various  consulting  service  assignments  and  incremental \nadministration costs. The required consulting services include E (i) support for the project \nimplementation management at PCO, including  the development and implementation of the \nproject performance management system (PPMS),  international and local; E (ii) advice and \nsupport for institutional reforms, technical  arrangements, and tendering  for the water supply \nsystem improvements at the five municipalities that will have a water supply subcomponent,7 \ninternational  and  local;  E (iii)  assistance  to  project  advisors/project  implementation  units \n(PAs/PIUs) in supporting the municipalities, local; and E (iv) a pool of short-term experts at the \ndisposal of the PCO, local. \n34.  Under subcomponent B (ii), each of the five municipalities, MPPW, and NWSC as the \nowner of the existing urban water supply system must agree on the arrangements for capital \ninvestment  project  management  as  well  as  subsequent  operational  arrangements  for  the \nresulting  water  supply  system  before  awarding  the  relevant  civil  works  contracts.  The \nGovernment policy of gradually transferring the authority to manage water supply from NWSC to \nlocal  governments  must  be  followed.  At  the  latest,  each  municipality  must  assume  full \nresponsibility8 for the water supply service by the time the resulting water supply system starts \n                                                 \n6  As defined in the Local Self Governance Act (1999), the ward committee is a group of elected representatives at \nward level (a ward is a geographic and administrative subunit of a municipality). \n7  Banepa, Panauti, Dhulikhel, Bharatpur, and Hetauda. \n8  Each municipality  must choose an appropriate form of management. Potential forms include establishment of \n(financially independent) municipal water supply department, contracting out to private operator, contracting out to \ngovernment operator (such as NWSC), delegating responsibility to water user groups, and a combination thereof. ", "  9\nits operations. To guide the five municipalities in carrying out the necessary institutional reform \nprocesses, action steps have been elaborated for Bharatpur and Hetauda (individual scheme) \nand for Banepa, Panauti, and Dhulikhel (regional scheme (para. 35 has more information), in \nSupplementary Appendix B Revisions to Water Supply Schemes. Furthermore, to address \nthese  rather  demanding  institutional  reform  exercises,  a  significant  amount  of  consulting \nservices is expected under subcomponent E (ii). The Government requested ADB's assistance \nin identifying potential grant funding for this pioneering sector reform initiative. If such grant \nfunding has been successfully identified, this item will be dropped from the loan funding. \nC.  Special Features \n35.  Specifically for Banepa, Panauti, and Dhulikhel, which are adjacent to one another, a \nregional and least-cost approach is recommended to permit the construction of an integrated \nwater supply system for all three municipalities. This approach will be more efficient than letting \neach of the three expand its existing water supply system individually. A neutral party  (a \ngovernment  agency,  a  government-controlled corporation, a joint venture among the three \nmunicipalities  concerned,  or  a  private  firm)  will  be  identified  and  tasked  with  physical \nimplementation of this subproject. The eventual operating entity will then either operate the \ncomplete water supply system for the three municipalities, or act as a bulk water supplier to \nthem or to water user groups/committees within these municipalities, which would then handle \nlocal distribution. If a private operator is charged with operating this proposed integrated water \nsupply system, it will be advisable to establish a controlling public body, which will procure such \na private operator through a competitive, transparent bidding process. These processes will be \nsupported by consultants recruited under the Project so that such a system is physically \nconstructed within the time frame of the Project. The regulating body, the National Water Supply \nRegulatory Board (NWSRB), which the Government intends to establish specifically for the \nwater supply sector in conjunction with the Melamchi Water Supply Project (Loan 1820-NEP) \nwill  oversee  the  development  of  a  sustainable  water  tariff  structure  in  all  locations,  and \ncontinuously monitor and regulate the subsequent tariff revisions. \n36.  The  expected  population  growth  rates  in  the  project  towns  are  high  (e.g.,  5%  in \nBharatpur). To address the corresponding urban spatial growth demands, land acquisition for \nthe  neighborhood  road,  drainage,  and  water  supply  development  subcomponent  will  be \nconducted through the mechanism of land pooling, instead of the usual straight purchase. Land \npooling, which was already implemented under the Kathmandu Urban Development Project \n(Loan  1240-NEP),  envisages  that  all  land  within  a  voluntarily  agreed-upon  development \nperimeter is temporarily pooled and, later on, redistributed to the original owners, after a \nnecessary percentage of the land to be used for public purposes has been deducted. This is to \nreduce  haphazard  development  and  urban  sprawl  and  land  speculation.  The  selection  of \nperimeters to be developed under this approach is such that involuntary resettlement ultimately \nwill not occur. Procedures and requirements to be followed, including eligibility criteria based on \nexpected  public  benefits,  public  notification  and  consultation  processes,  and  financial \nrequirements are summarized in Appendix 4 and Supplementary Appendix C. \n37.  In parallel with the Project, a cluster of activities designed specifically to support the \npoorer groups living in the rural farming communities within the municipalities covered by the \nmain Project, is proposed. This scheme will be designed based on the UNDP-supported RUPP, \nwhich has been successfully implemented in Nepal for several years. It is expected to contribute \nto poverty reduction, not only in the main urban areas but also in the surrounding rural areas \nwithin the municipalities. Its approximate total cost of $2.2 million is expected to be funded from \nother resources. ", "10  \n38.  Also in parallel with the Project, selected activities in the solid waste management sub-\nsector focusing on composting of biodegradable waste is proposed. Its approximate total cost of \n$1.0 million is expected to be funded from other resources. \nD.  Cost Estimates \n39.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $37.50 million equivalent (including taxes \nand duties of $4.38 million), of which $12.62 million (33.7%) is the foreign exchange cost \nincluding $0.78 million in interest charges during construction, and $24.88 million equivalent \n(66.3%) is the local currency cost.

Financing Plan \n40.  ADB will provide a loan in the amount of SDR22,699,000 ($30.00 million equivalent) \nfrom its Special Funds resources, which will represent 80% of the total cost of the Project. The \nloan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest of 1% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. It will cover the entire foreign \nexchange cost of the Project in the amount of $12.62 million (including interest and other \ncharges amounting to $0.78 million), and will finance $17.38 million equivalent, or 69.9%, of the \nlocal currency cost. The local currency cost to be financed by ADB will cover portions of the civil \nworks, equipment and vehicles, consulting services and project management support, but \nexcluding  duties  and  taxes  estimated  at  $4.38  million.  ADB\u2019s  financing  of  local  currency \nexpenditure is justified by the nature of the Project, which will address local poverty and health \nissues  within  the  project  areas.  Local  currency  financing  of  $4.40  million  equivalent,  or \napproximately 11.7% of the total project cost, will be provided by the Government, and will cover \npart of the cost of civil works and consulting services, and the cost of counterpart staff required \nfor the proposed central PCO, the PAs, and the PIUs. The project towns and user groups, \nincluding the private sector, will contribute $3.10 million equivalent, or around 8.3% of the total ", "  11\nproject cost.

The Government will relend a portion of the loan funds to the eight municipalities through \nrupee-denominated  subsidiary  loan  agreements  (SLAs)  in  accordance  with  government \nregulations on relending, including standard terms and conditions for implementing subprojects. \nThe subsidiary loans will have an interest rate of 8% per annum with a repayment period of 20 \nyears including a grace period of 5 years. The municipalities and community will also provide \ncounterpart funds \u2013 for example, 8% of project capital costs in a combination of cash (at least \n5%) and in kind (no more than 3%) for water supply subprojects. The Government will bear the \nforeign  exchange  risk.  Funds  will  be  repaid  to  the  Government  according  to  terms  and \nconditions defined in the SLAs, which will need to be acceptable to ADB. ", "12  \n43.  For supplementary urban facilities and all subprojects in Dhadingbesi, the Government \nwill relend the ADB loan to the TDF through a rupee-denominated SLA at an interest rate of 5% \nper annum with maturity of 20 years including a grace period of 5 years. The TDF will, in turn, \nonlend the funds to relevant entities as subloans at an interest rate of 8% per annum with a \nmaturity of 12-15 years including a grace period of 3 years. The Government will bear the \nforeign exchange risk. The TDF may use the repayments for financing similar town projects until \nthe maturity of its borrowing from the Government. \n44.  The Government, the municipalities, TDF, and ADB will jointly review the relending and \nonlending rates every 2 years from the date of loan effectiveness to ensure that the rates are in \nline with the general economic conditions of the country. \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n45.  MPPW will be the EA for the Project and will carry out its responsibilities for overall \nsupervision and execution of the project through its Department of Urban Development and \nBuilding Construction (DUDBC). The EA will discharge its duties in overall implementation \nmanagement mainly through the PCO to be headed by the PCO director. The participating \nmunicipalities will be the Implementing Agencies (IA) for all subprojects. This approach is in line \nwith the decentralization objectives of the Local Self Governance Act of 1999 and the related \nbylaws, and it will encourage the municipalities to display a greater sense of ownership of their \nsubprojects. Moreover, according to a review of previous urban projects, it is important that the \nmunicipalities take a lead role to ensure the sustainable O&M of subprojects, and to strengthen \nurban management capacity. However, the overall supervision of the water supply subprojects \nto be built for the municipalities of Banepa, Dhulikhel, and Panauti under subcomponent B (ii) \nwill be carried out in accordance with arrangements mutually acceptable to the Government and \nADB. Also, the participating municipalities may discharge their duties through duly appointed \nthird parties where required, particularly for subprojects under subcomponent C (ii). \n46.  Implementation at the municipal level will be managed using one of two possible models: \nthe PA model, or the PIU model. The PA model is preferred by two municipalities with relatively \nadvanced  institutional  capabilities  (i.e.,  Bharatpur  and  Hetauda),  while  the  PIU  model  is \npreferred by the remaining municipalities whose institutional capabilities are still weak. The PA \nmodel  envisages  that  the  municipal  administration9  will  essentially  be  in  charge  of \nimplementation management, headed by a project manager and assisted by a  PA without \nexecutive function. The PIU model, on the other hand, envisages that a PIU, headed by a \nproject manager who is DUDBC staff seconded to the municipality, will be established by the \nrespective municipality and staffed with the assistance of the EA, and that this PIU will assume \nthe executive function for implementing the Project, subject to general guidance from the \nmunicipality in question. Each PIU is expected to manage not only the main project but also the \ntwo  parallel  schemes  on  rural-urban  partnership  and  solid  waste  management.  For \nmunicipalities that adopt the PA model, some additional support will be provided either for \nrelevant municipal units or for the PAs in order to help them manage these two parallel \nschemes.  DUDBC  will  use  its  own  personnel  resources  and  enlist  the  support  of  other \ngovernment agencies, as necessary, for establishing an effective PCO as well as effective PIUs \nfor municipalities that require one. The organizational structure for implementing the Project is in \nAppendix 9. \n                                                 \n9  including its council, board, committees, sections, subsections, and units. ", "  13\n2.  Implementation Period \n47.  The Project will be implemented over 6 years from 2003 to 2009. Considering the limited \npersonnel resources at DUDBC and other relevant central Government agencies from which \nstaff will be seconded for PAs/PIUs, a staggered implementation arrangement will be used. The \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 10. \n3.  Procurement \n48.  All procurement services for the Project will follow ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. \nContract for civil works estimated to cost $1.0 million equivalent or more will be carried out using \ninternational competitive bidding (ICB) procedures while contracts that are estimated to cost \nless than $1.0 million equivalent will be carried out under local competitive bidding (LCB) \nprocedures. Good to be procured will preferably be grouped into packages equivalent to or \nlarger than $500,000 to be suitable for ICB procedures. Miscellaneous minor goods that cannot \nbe grouped into larger contracts and are estimated to cost less than $500,000 per contract will \nbe procured through international shopping (IS) procedures. Minor items estimated to cost less \nthan the equivalent of $100,000 per contract may be purchased directly, following proper \nprocedures to ensure economy, efficiency, and quality. The proposed contract packages are \nshown in Appendix 11. \n4.  Consulting Services \n49.  All consulting services to be financed under the Project will be selected and engaed \nfollowing the ADB's  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, using QCBS method, and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. A total input of 29 person-\nmonths of international and 747 person-months of domestic consulting services is planned. The \nconsulting inputs will cover a wide range of expertise and will result in substantial strengthening \nof administrative and management capacity and skills of the EA and IAs. \n50.  The consulting services are designed to support the project as well as build the longer \nterm capacity of the agencies and institutions responsible for planning and delivering urban \nservices. They will cover broad areas of expertise including (i) project implementation support \nand  project  performance  monitoring;  (ii)  topographic  surveys,  mapping,  geotechnical \ninvestigations, and water testing; (iii) engineering design and construction supervision; (iv) \ninstitutional reforms in the water supply sector; (v) training; and (vi) community development. \nIndicative terms of reference for the major packages are in Supplementary Appendix D. \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n51.  DUDBC  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  disbursement  projections  and  requesting \nbudget allocations for counterpart funds. It will establish an imprest account for the program. \nThe initial amount will be no more than a 6 month projected disbursement, or 10% of the loan \namount, whichever is lower. The imprest account will be established, managed, and liquidated \nin accordance with ADB's  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  Statement-of-expenditure  (SOE) \nprocedures may be used to reimburse eligible expenditures not exceeding $100,000, and to \nliquidate advances made into the imprest account in accordance with the guidelines. DUDBC \nwill coordinate the timely release of funds. This is essential because project activities will take \nplace at different locations and simple mechanisms are required to disburse small funds quickly \nthrough decentralized decision making while maintaining acceptable levels of financial control. \nAuditors satisfactory to ADB will audit the use of the imprest account and SOE procedures. A \nseparate audit opinion on the use of the imprest account and SOE procedures will be included \nin the annual audit report. ", "14  \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n52.  The Government, acting through DUDBC, will maintain records and accounts adequate \nto identify works, goods, and services financed out of the loan proceeds. Specifically, DUDBC \nwill (i) maintain separate accounts for the Project; (ii) ensure that project accounts and financial \nstatements are audited annually in accordance with sound accounting principles by independent \nauditors satisfactory to ADB; and (iii) submit to ADB, not later than 9 months after the close of \neach fiscal year, certified copies of audited accounts and financial statements and the auditor's \nreport on them. \n53.  DUDBC will prepare quarterly progress reports, in a format satisfactory to ADB, with \ninformation on (i) progress made against established targets, including pre-identified monitoring \nindicators;  (ii)  delays  and  problems  encountered,  and  actions  taken  to  resolve  them; \n(iii) compliance with loan covenants; (iv) proposed program of activities to be undertaken during \nthe next quarter; and (v) expected progress during the next quarter. Within 3 months of physical \ncompletion of the project, the Government will prepare and submit to ADB a project completion \nreport  on  the  execution  of  the  project,  including  the  costs  and  compliance  with  the  loan \ncovenants. \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n54.  In  accordance  with  ADB's  PPMS  Handbook,  a  shortlist  of  verifiable  performance \nindicators for monitoring and evaluation was prepared (Supplementary Appendix E). PPMS \nactivities will be conducted periodically to gather information through multiple sources so as to \ndetermine whether the input deliveries for implementing the subprojects have rendered the \nexpected benefits to the intended beneficiaries. PPMS also seeks to detect any deficiency and \ndiscrepancy  between  the  plan  and  the  execution  of  a  subproject  in  using  the  resources \nefficiently so that timely corrections can be made to adjust the project design and thus improve \nthe benefits, outcomes, and impact. PCO, with the assistance of a project-financed consultant \nteam, will develop comprehensive PPMS procedures and plans in accordance with ADB's \nHandbook  within  9  months  of  loan  effectiveness.  The  PPMS  procedures,  performance \nindicators,  and  their  targets  have  been  reviewed  and  approved  by  ADB,  and  most  are \nincorporated in the Project framework (Appendix 1). PCO, with the help of their consultant, will \nthen undertake a quantitative and qualitative project performance monitoring for each project \ncomponent to evaluate the delivery of the planned facilities and the project benefits accrued. \nThe nine municipalities and their respective PAs/PIUs will assist PCO and the PPMS consultant \nteam to carry out PPMS activities. These activities will be conducted annually: one immediately \nbefore the ADB midterm review and the one upon project completion to be more comprehensive \nthan the others. \n8.  Project Review \n55.  The Project will be reviewed jointly by the Government and ADB semiannually to assess \nprogress and at midterm more comprehensively. Taking into account the PPMS performance \nmonitoring  results,  the  midterm  review  will  (i)  evaluate  the  Project\u2019s  scope,  design,  and \nimplementation  arrangements;  (ii)  evaluate  the  progress  of  the  institutional  strengthening \nprocesses, including reforms for the water supply subsector; (iii) identify changes needed in any \nof  the  areas  reviewed;  (iv)  assess  implementation  performance  against  agreed-upon \nperformance indicator targets in the logical framework; (v) identify critical issues and constraints, \nif  any;  and  (vi)  recommend  adjustments  to  the  Project  design  and/or  implementation \narrangements, if necessary. ", "  15\n9.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n56.  The Project will require the permanent acquisition of a total of 26.7 hectares (ha) of land, \nof which 11.0 ha is owned by the Government, 6.9 ha by municipalities, 0.6 ha by other \nGovernment agencies, and 8.2 ha by private landowners. Acquisition of the identified land is not \nexpected to result in significant loss of livelihood or loss of community resources. The short \nLand Acquisition and Resettlement Action Plan (Supplementary Appendix F) includes details on \nland acquisition requirements identified by the Project. A summary of the plan is in Appendix 12. \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefits and Impacts \n57.  The Project will directly benefit the urban population of about 320,000 in the selected \nnine urban areas through improved personal hygiene, environmental sanitation, and overall \nquality of life. In particular, the EIRRs  for the water supply subprojects are estimated to be \naround 22-28%. The participating local institutions, including municipalities and prospective \nwater supply utilities under municipal control, will be strengthened in terms of management and \nfinancial capacities for sustainable urban development. \n58.  As the first decentralized urban project for Nepal, this Project is expected to establish an \nimportant  precedent  for  a  series  of  similar  projects  that  could  follow.  With  respect  to \ndecentralization, in addition to strengthening the municipalities themselves, the Project is also \nexpected to help establish financially and institutionally self-sustainable water supply utilities \nunder municipal control in Bharatpur, Hetauda, Banepa, Dhulikhel, and Panauti. Furthermore, \nregional  integration  of  the  water  supply  service  is  anticipated  for  Banepa,  Panauti,  and, \nadditionally, Dhulikhel. These will help the Government's effort to arrest the increasing trend of \nmigration  to  Kathmandu.  Through  various  interventions,  the  Project  will  help  improve  the \nframework for public-private partnership, too. \n59.  As a part of the project preparatory technical assistance, an IEE was carried out for the \nentire Project. The IEE concluded that the subprojects and components for all the 9 project \ntowns will have negligible adverse impacts on the environment, which could be overcome \nthrough adequate mitigation measures and regular monitoring during the design, construction, \nand operation phases. The Project is expected to bring about significant improvements in \npersonal, household, and community hygiene, and environmental sanitation, thereby enhancing \nthe quality of life and community health. The individual IEE conducted for each town also \nshowed  no  apparent  adverse  or  harmful  environmental  impacts  of  any significance and, \ntherefore,  a  full-scale  environmental  impact  assessment  is  not  required  for  any  of  the \nsubprojects. An example of summary IEE (SIEE) is attached as Appendix 13. \n60.  Economic  and  financial  analyses  of  the  proposed  subprojects  were  prepared  in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Framework  for  the  Economic  and  Financial  Appraisal  of  Urban \nDevelopment Sector Projects. Base case EIRRs for water supply, which constitute about 23% of \nthe total project cost, varies from 22.3% to 28.9%, confirming the economic robustness of the \nproposed  subproject.  The  least-cost  analysis  was  applied  to  sanitation  and  wastewater \nmanagement,  river  training  works,  and  road  upgrading  subprojects.  The  sanitation  and \nwastewater  management  subproject  was  subjected  to  least-cost  analysis  with  reed  bed \ntreatment system as the least-cost option for all the towns except Dhadingbesi, where the \nconventional wastewater treatment has marginally lower cost. The river training works were \nsubjected to least-cost analysis with gabion box-based embankment protection for three towns \n(Bharatpur, Hetauda, and Kamalamai) as the least-cost option. Road upgrading was subjected \nto least-cost analysis with black topping the earthen road for three towns (Banepa, Dhulikhel, ", "16  \nand  Ratnanagar)  as  the  least-cost  option.  The  FIRRs  were  calculated  for  the  revenue-\ngenerating subcomponent and water supply. The water supply subprojects in all the five towns \nwere found to be financially viable, with base case FIRRs ranging from 6.5% to 9.0%, exceeding \nthe weighted average cost of capital of 4.6%. The results of economic and financial analyses \nand the financial projections for the nine project towns are in Appendix 14. \nB.  Risks \n61.  The main risks include (i) limited capacities of the municipal government staff to carry out \nthe investment project (considering the history of difficulties in conducting procurement in \nNepal), and operate and maintain the resulting facilities on a sustainable basis; (ii) uncertainty \nregarding  the  continued  political  support  for  decentralization,  including  sufficient  budget \nallocation; (iii) uncertainty regarding the planned municipal revenue improvements whose failure \nwould endanger the municipalities' repayment of their loans to the Government; (iv) uncertainty \nregarding the willingness of local communities to contribute time, counterpart funds, and other \nresources for project implementation; and (v) the general political stability and security in the \ncountry, given the recent insurgency. During implementation, procedures will be developed to \nmitigate the effects of the conflict on the Project. The staggered schedule for beginning activities \nin the project towns provides some flexibility to defer activities when security conditions are \nunfavorable. \n62.  Regarding component C supplementary urban facilities, TDF management's capacity to \nprofessionally  appraise/screen  the  proposals  during  project  implementation  is  another  risk. \nWhether or not a proposal involves private sector participation, it should yield sufficient financial \nreturn. \n63.  Regarding the water supply subcomponent, the uncertainty regarding continued political \nsupport for water supply sector reforms is a risk. In particular, NWSC must smoothly transform \nitself in accordance with the Government's decentralization policy for the urban water supply \nsector. \n64.  The  expected  benefits  and  positive  impacts  outweigh  the  costs  of  associated  risks \npresented in paras. 61-63. Decentralization is one of the Government's commitments towards \nreform and, thus, this Project is a timely contribution to the reform process. Furthermore, the \nProject is expected to complement the Melamchi Water Supply Project in addressing the water \nsupply sector reform. \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n65.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n1.  Execution of Project \na.  Implementation Arrangements \n66.  Project Coordination Office.  The  PCO  will  be  based  within  DUDBC  and \nmaintained  throughout  the  project  implementation  period  with  adequate  staffing  and  other \nresources as may be agreed-upon by the Borrower and ADB. The PCO will be headed by a \nproject director, who will be responsible for day-to-day management of the Project at the central \nlevel. The PCO will provide the required professional, subprofessional, and support staff to carry ", "  17\nout its duties of planning, coordination, monitoring, and supervision. The task includes providing \nthe necessary specialized engineering staff, whenever required, to review designs, conduct field \nchecks for critical elements of the detailed design of physical facilities for the Project. \n67.  Project Implementation Units and Project Advisors.  The Borrower will cause the \nmunicipalities of Banepa, Dhulikhel, Panauti, Bidur, Ratnanagar, and Kamalamai to establish \nthe PIUs within 3 months of loan effectiveness and to maintain the PIUs with adequate staffing \nand other resources throughout the implementation of their respective subprojects. (The PIU for \nDhadingbesi will be established as and when it has become a municipality). The PIUs will be \nheaded by Project Managers who will be DUDBC staff seconded to the municipalities and will \nbe responsible for day-to-day implementation of the subprojects in their respective municipal \nareas. \n68.  The  municipalities  of  Hetauda  and  Bharatpur  will  appoint  their  respective  Project \nManagers within 3 months of the loan effectiveness. DUDBC will second a project advisor (PA) \nto each of these two municipalities. The PAs will assist the staff of subject municipalities in \nsubproject implementation, and will not have any executive functions. The Borrower will also \ncause the municipalities to retain the PAs during project implementation and to make the \nnecessary resources available for the conduct of their functions. \n69.

The Borrower will establish the PSC within 1 \nmonth of the loan effectiveness and maintain it throughout project Implementation with the same \ncomposition: chaired by the secretary of MPPW and comprising representatives from MPPW, \nMinistry  of  Finance,  Municipal  Management  Division  of  the  Ministry  of  Local  Development, \nDUDBC, Department of Water Supply and Sanitation of MPPW, National Planning Commission, \nTDF, the chairperson of the Municipal Association of Nepal, two mayors nominated on a rotation \nbasis from among the mayors of the municipalities, and ADB as an observer. DUDBC will serve \nas the secretariat for the PSC. The PSC will meet at least once every two months initially, and \nas often as necessary afterwards, and provide guidance to the EA and the municipalities, as the \nIAs, in project implementation matters. \n70.  Municipal Steering Committee (MSC).  The Borrower will cause each municipality \nto establish a MSC within 3 months of the loan effectiveness, comprising the mayor, deputy \nmayor, three members of the municipal council to be appointed by such council, secretary, \nrelevant department heads of the municipality, chief of the Division Office of DUDBC, four \nmembers  representing  the  local  disadvantaged  communities,  NGOs,  community  based \norganizations, and the private sector, to be appointed by the municipal council, and respective \nProject Manager (and the PA for Hetauda and Bharatpur). The Project Manager will serve as \nthe secretary to each MSC. The MSC will advise the municipality concerned in subproject \nimplementation matters. \nb.  Relending and Onlending Arrangements \n71.  TDF's Onlending.  The Borrower will ensure that, subject to PCO's approval, the TDF \nonlends the TDF subsidiary loan  - under terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB  - to the \nmunicipalities for the selected subprojects under component C, and to Dhadingbesi for the \nselected subprojects under components B and C, as may be agreed-upon between the TDF \nand the municipality concerned or Dhadingbesi, as the case may be. The municipalities and \nDhadingbesi will carry out feasibility studies for the selected subprojects under component C, in \nsuch details and format satisfactory to the Borrower and the Bank, prior to seeking financing \nfrom the TDF. The TDF will subsequently review and endorse the feasibility studies with respect \nto the financial viability of the underlying subproject before submitting them to the PCO for \napproval. ", "18  \n72.  Security for Subsidiary Loans.  The Borrower will ensure, and cause the TDF to \nensure, that the municipalities provide appropriate and adequate collateral, satisfactory to ADB, \nto secure their respective obligations under the subsidiary loan agreements and the subloan \nagreements. \n2.  Other Matters \na.  Cost Recovery/Affordability and Sustainability of Water Supply \n73.  The Borrower will ensure, and will cause municipalities that implement water supply \nsubprojects to ensure that (i) a cost recovery plan, which includes, among others, volumetric \ntariffs and connections charges; and (ii) arrangements for the management and operation of \nsuch subprojects, all of which will be satisfactory to ADB, are prepared and approved by the \nrelevant authority of the Borrower before relevant civil works contracts are signed. (refer to para. \n83(i) for corresponding condition). \nb.  Regional Water Supply \n74.  The Borrower will ensure that financing for the water supply subprojects  Banepa, \nPanauti, and Dhulikhel does not exceed 80% of the capital investment cost that would be \nrequired under a regional and least-cost approach and will cause those municipalities to adopt \nsuch an approach with respect to their water supply requirements. \nc.  Counterpart Funding \n75.  The Borrower will ensure that the Project is maintained as a priority project of the \nBorrower and adequate budgetary allocations of required counterpart funds are made and \nreleased  in  a  timely  manner  to  DUDBC  and  the  municipalities  for  each  year  of  project \nimplementation. \nd.  Land Acquisition, Resettlement and Water Rights \n76.  The Borrower will ensure that  \n(i)  all  land,  rights-of-way,  and  other  land-related  rights  for  any  subproject  are \nacquired or otherwise made available to the municipality concerned, free of all \nencumbrances, before the relevant civil works contract are signed; \n(ii)  all land for the Project is acquired in accordance with the land acquisition plan \nprepared for the Project and agreed upon by the Borrower and ADB; \n(iii)  perimeters for the proposed subprojects are selected in a way that minimizes or \ndoes not cause any involuntary resettlement; \n(iv)  involuntary resettlement, if any, under the Project is undertaken in accordance \nwith \n(a)  the resettlement framework already prepared and approved by the Borrower, \n(b)  the  individual  resettlement  plans  to  be  prepared  for  each  municipality  in \naccordance with the resettlement framework, and \n(c)  ADB's Handbook on Resettlement; and \n(v)  all  water  rights  and  related  rights  for  any  subproject  are  acquired  or  made \navailable to the municipality concerned, free of all encumbrances, before the \nrelevant civil works contract are signed. \ne.  Environment \n77.  The Borrower will ensure, and cause the municipalities and the TDF to ensure, that (i) \nthe  Project  is  carried  out,  and  all  project  facilities  are  designed,  constructed,  operated, ", "  19\nmaintained, and monitored in conformity with the existing environmental laws and regulations of \nthe  Borrower  and  the  environmental  guidelines  of  ADB,  in  particular  the  Environmental \nAssessment Requirements of the Asian Development Bank; (ii) all monitoring and mitigation \nmeasures enumerated in the IEE and the Environmental Monitoring and Management Plan \nprepared for the Project in consultation with stakeholders are duly undertaken; and (iii) local \ncommunities are duly consulted during the implementation period on such measures. \nf.

Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n80.  The Borrower will ensure that, within 9 months of loan effectiveness, the PCO, assisted \nby the consultants recruited under the Project, develops a comprehensive PPMS, including the \nrespective procedures and plans, in accordance with the relevant guidelines of the ADB. The \nBorrower will cause the PCO to undertake quantitative and qualitative project performance \nmonitoring for each project component by using PPMS to enable the Borrower to evaluate the \ndelivery of the planned facilities and the project benefits accrued. \nB.  Condition for Loan Effectiveness \n81.  The following is the condition for loan effectiveness: \nThe subsidiary loan agreements, with terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB, will have been \nduly signed and become legally binding for the Borrower and three municipalities (Bharatpur, \nDhulikhel, and Hetauda) and for the TDF. \nC.  Conditions for Withdrawals from Loan Account \n82.  No withdrawals will be made from the Loan Account for financing the subprojects in parts \nof the project area that comprise the municipalities of Banepa, Ratnanagar, Panauti, Bidur, and \nKamalamai, under component B of the Project until: ", "20  \n(i)  Relevant  subsidiary  loan  agreement  has  been  duly  executed  between  the \nBorrower and the municipality concerned, and delivered to ADB on behalf of the \nBorrower. \n(ii)  The municipality concerned has agreed, in writing, to be bound by the terms of \nthe  Project  Agreement  between  ADB  and  the  municipalities  of  Bharatpur, \nDhulikhel, and Hetauda, as if originally parties thereto. \nD.

A review of national policies mentioned in Nepal\u2019s Ninth Five-Year Plan and draft Tenth \nFive-Year Plan reveals the following basic features: \n\u2022  Urban development and environment protection-related policies are directly concerned \nwith urban and environment improvement while the local development, nongovernment \norganization (NGO) and poverty-reduction related policies are intended to facilitate the \ngoal of urban environment improvement (UEI). \n\u2022  The policy on decentralization indicates the process to be followed for undertaking UEI-\nrelated development activities. \n\u2022  All  policies  are  intended  to  encourage  the  adoption  of  participatory  development \nprocesses  in  the  sense  that  all  development  actors\u2014local government institutions \n(LGIs), NGOs, private sector, government agencies and communities\u2014are to be actively \ninvolved in UEI-related projects. \n\u2022  The  policies  give  special  emphasis  on  institutional  and  capacity  building  for  the \ndevelopment actors at both central and local levels. \n\u2022  Although  the  policies  are  rightly  developed  as  per  the  needs  of  Nepal\u2019s  urban \ndevelopment and environment promotion, they are not consistent with the relatively low \nlevel of Nepal's overall institutional and administrative capacity. Hence, the outputs of \nimplementing these policies will obviously be quite limited. \n2.  Thus, on the whole, although the policies are rightly conceived, their implementation is \nlargely weak, with adverse implications on urban development and environment improvement \nactivities. \nFurther details of these policies are summarized below. \nA.

History, Ownership, and Organizational Structure \n1.   The Town Development Fund (TDF) was established under the Ministry of Physical \nPlanning and Works (MPPW) in 19891 to facilitate financing of urban infrastructure projects in \nmunicipalities or urbanizing villages. It is governed under Town Development Act 2053 (1997), \nwith investment policies and procedures stipulated in the related Town Development Fund \nRules, 1997. The legislation establishes the TDF as a Government-owned autonomous body to \nprovide financial, technical, and institutional support and research to institutions engaged in \ntown development. The TDF board comprises the secretary or the representative from MPPW \n(chair), Ministry of Finance (MOF), and Ministry of Local Development (MLD); five Government-\nnominated mayors representing the five regions; two board-nominated financial and technical \nexperts; and an executive director appointed by the board through open competition. Others \nmay participate as observers, as necessary. \n2.  With  Government  approval,  the  TDF  may  act  with  any  foreign  government  or \norganization in areas of its activities. It is authorized to receive grant and loan funds from the \nGovernment and other organizations, foreign governments, and international agencies for its \nprograms. It may invest funds, issue debentures within prescribed regulations, and retain \nservice charges. The TDF may give grants and loans to any institution engaged in town \ndevelopment: government and nongovernment  institutions, user groups, village development \ncommittees (VDCs), and municipalities. The TDF stipulates the terms and conditions of its loan \nor grant and specifies conditions of recourse in the event of default, including seizure of pledged \nsecurity. The board has an Investment Promotion Committee for preparing investment policies \nand procedures. \n3.  The TDF is organized under four divisions: (i) Loans and Grants Division; (ii) Technical \nand Monitoring Division; (iii) Finance Division; and (iv) Administration Division. Additional staff or \nconsultants are employed on an as-required basis. As a result, the TDF maintains a lean \norganization. \nB.   Performance \n1.   Financial \n4.   TDF's funding for loan and grant projects to date has originated from the World Bank, \nUnited Nations Development Programme, Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) , and Deutsche \nGesellschaft  fur  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  (German  Agency  for  Technical  Cooperation \n[GTZ]) and Government contributions. As of the end of FY1999, the TDF had accumulated grant \nfunds of $2.90 million, Government contributions of $0.19 million, and World Bank loan of $1.35 \nmillion, with retained earnings and capital fund totaling $0.42 million. Assets were $4.47 million, \nincluding project loans of $3.56 million to municipalities. \n5.   As of the end of FY1999, the TDF had disbursed $1.8 million in World Bank loans, $0.2 \nmillion in KfW loans, $1.4 million in grants from GTZ, and $0.5 million in loans plus $1.6 million \nin grants from KfW. Almost all interest and principal repayments have been paid on the agreed-\nupon terms, with overdue interest representing 4% of total interest charged. Two municipalities \nhave not met the agreed-upon term, requiring the payments to be collected directly from the \nGovernment.  To  date,  no  provision  for  loan  losses  has  been  made  since  repayment \nperformance has been strong, with loans' performance exceeding 95% of interest and principal \ndue. Although loan agreements generally have recourse to payment through the Government, \nthe TDF bears the primary risk for loan losses. Recently agreed-upon terms for a second phase \n                                                 \n1  Town Development Fund Board (formation) Order 2045 (1989).

The terms also include the recommendation \nof a recent external policy review2 that the TDF should retain and transfer 2% of its interest \nincome to a special contingency reserve for potential loan losses. \n6.   Loan approvals have averaged $560,000 annually over the past 3 years The average \nloan size has increased in recent years to about $110,000, the largest being $440,000. The TDF \ncurrently  finances  projects  in  all  but  2  of  the  original  36  municipalities,  with  65  projects \ncompleted and 70 in progress. Social infrastructure development projects include public toilets \nand drainage, water systems, feasibility studies, solid waste collection equipment and sanitary \nlandfills, school buildings, and bus parks. Commercial loans include those to commercial retail \nbuildings. In total (including grant projects), the TDF has handled over 553 projects worth almost \n$8.5 million. \n7.   The net income for TDF has averaged NRs6.5 million3 over the past 3 years, with a \n3.3% average return on assets and 10.0% return on equity.

Over  its  10  years  of  operation,  TDF  has  developed  policies,  procedures4  and \nstandardized documents for grant and loan applications, evaluations, grant approvals, loan \nagreements, tendering, fund disbursement, and repayment monitoring. Projects under KfW \nfunding are financed by grants or loans, depending on the nature of the project and the income \nof the municipality. It has been recommended that future grants apply only to low-income \nmunicipalities and be restricted to the areas of sanitation, environment, and school projects. \nGrants  are  provided  with  counterparts  funds  from  the  municipalities.  The  tendering  and \ncontracting of projects financed under KfW funding are monitored by TDF's own staff at no \ncharge  to  the  municipalities.  The  TDF  supplies  technical  support  to  municipalities  with \ninadequate engineering capacity to plan, evaluate, and oversee implementation of their projects. \nIt also provides financial and accounting training, support, and post-implementation monitoring \nof operations to assess financial and operational performance. \n9.   To procure consulting services, the TDF maintains a roster of 24 prequalified consultants \nfor each architecture and planning project as well as engineering project. A roster of 12 \nprequalified consultants is maintained for each category of projects. Depending on performance, \nconsultants are removed from the list and others added. For competitive bidding, a shortlist \ngroup of six consultants is drawn from the appropriate pool, based on a regular rotation. If less \nthan three proposals are received, additional consultants are invited from the next group. The \nTDF prepares the terms of reference in all projects requiring consulting services. After an \ninvitation for proposals, consultants are briefed in a prebid meeting.

In the case of \nsupervision  assignments  to  a  design  consultant  (if  prequalified  by  TDF),  negotiations  are \nconducted directly with the consultant who prepared the master plan or design. Services, \nstudies, and designs are awarded by competitive bidding if the contract value is greater than \nNRs0.2 million. With contracts not exceeding NRs0.5 million, direct negotiation may be used. \nThe guidelines specify recourse in the event of cost overruns from construction delays caused \nby either the contractor or the municipality. All projects exceeding NRs1.5 million, or where \ncompetent  domestic  consultants  are  not  available,  must  be  supervised  by  a  consultant \nappointed by the TDF. \n10.   For procurement of construction works, projects costing less than NRs1.0 million may be \nexecuted through a user committee or by municipalities utilizing force account, or by suppliers \noffering  the  lowest  price,  based  on  quotations  in  three  sealed  envelopes  (records  to  be \nmaintained by the committee). Local shopping may be used for small purchases that cannot be \nincluded in other works, or where items are readily available through local suppliers. Three \nsealed  quotes  must  be  obtained,  evaluated,  and  submitted  to  the  TDF  for  approval. \nConstruction projects valued over NRs1.0 million are procured by tender, using standard tender \ndocuments as specified in a project appraisal report. The tendering process is similar to the \nbidding process for procuring consulting services, except that tenders are nationally advertised. \nTechnical evaluation is based on financial and technical past performance and capacity to \nundertake the work. Contractors are required to provide performance security. Contracts include \nboth penalties for nonperformance and incentives for early completion.  \nC.   Capacity for Management of Project Loan Financing \n1.   Financial \n11.   Projections were prepared to determine the financial capacity of the TDF to undertake \nthe proposed Project. As a relatively small financial institution, the TDF must have sufficient \nspread between the relending rate from MOF and the onlending rate to the subprojects and \nadequate financial capacity to cover project-related costs in the intervening period until subloan \nrepayments begin to provide cash flow and revenue. The incremental operation costs for staff, \nlogistical support, financial training program, and administration are based on TDF estimates. \nConstruction costs were developed based on four phases of 44 construction projects, with 8 \nstarting in the first quarter of 2001, and 12 each in the fourth quarters of 2002, 2003, and 2004, \nrespectively.  Each  project  is  assumed  to  average  NRs62.5  million  in  1999  prices.  Loan \ndisbursements are based on 25% of construction costs being disbursed semiannually over a 2-\nyear construction period. Based on the ratio of foreign costs to local costs, construction costs \nare assumed to increase 5% per year, and the price contingency will be adequately covered by \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  financing  being  in  dollars.  Local  inflation  is  estimated  to \ncontinue at 7.0%, foreign inflation is assumed as 2.4%. As the water users and sanitation \ncommittees (WUSCs) will have no funds to pay interest until operations begin, interest during \nconstruction is assumed to be capitalized for both WUSC and TDF. Interest on borrowing to \ncover cash-flow deficits is assumed at 12%, current commercial bank rates on overdrafts and \nloans ranging from 11.5% to 15%. Interest income on surplus funds available for investment is \nassumed at 4%, current commercial rates on deposits ranging from 3% to 8%. \n12.   Financial projections incorporate the incremental cash-flow impacts of the Project, with \nprojections  for  existing  TDF  operation.  The  TDF  cash-flow  projections  are  premised  on \noperational plans before the recently agreed-upon new KfW funding. The projections show that \nthe Project will initially have a negative impact on TDF incomes during the period 2001-2003 ", "32  Appendix 3 \nuntil interest revenues from the subloans flow in starting 2004. However, cash flow should be \nmore than sufficient to cover interim expenses relating to the Project. While the overall financial \npositions are healthy over the projection period, the current ratios will deteriorate until 2005 and \nimprove  marginally  thereafter,  indicating  inadequacy  of  long-term  capital  and  the  need  to \nfinance operations with short-term borrowings. This aspect will need to be monitored closely. \nKfW recently approved DM14.0 million5 funding for the TDF for a second phase of the town \ndevelopment program for grants and establishment of a long-term sustainable revolving fund for \nfinancing municipal infrastructure. Plans for managing these funds have not yet been finalized. \nThe new funding will strengthen, rather than weaken, TDF's financial capacity; therefore, the \nfinancial projections conservatively present TDF's financial outlook. \n \n2.   Operational \n13.   The Project is much larger than anything the TDF has handled to date, but the TDF's \nperformance  record  indicates  that  it  has  developed  significant  experience  in  working  with \nmunicipalities, and has developed an efficient and effective mode of operation. Over 10 years of \noperation, the TDF has developed clear policies, procedures, and standardized documents. It \nhas gained much practical experience in project identification and design, to ensure the projects \nare appropriate and responsive to the needs of the community. It has also gained considerable \nexperience  in  working  with  local  contractors,  improving  procedures  over  time.  As  an \nautonomous body, it has been flexible and responsive in project implementation, and gained \ntrust through transparent operations. \n14.   It currently has a trained staff of 38, of whom 15 have graduate or postgraduate \nqualifications in finance and business administration, engineering, architecture, and law. Further \ncapacity building is ongoing through professional training. The TDF estimates that the additional \nwork for the Project could be handled with an additional staff of two or three engineers, a \nfinancial  specialist,  sociologist,  accountant,  and  additional  support  staff  of  drivers  and  a \nsecretary. Under the recently approved second-phase KfW funding, the technical assistance \nand international consultant support will be continued. This is additional assurance to ADB that \nthere will be continuity in monitoring and the standards of TDF operations during project \nimplementation.\n                                                 \n5   Conversion rate: DM1=$0.4467 as of 16 August 2000.

It facilitates town planning by \u201cLocal Bodies,\u201d which are defined as \n(i)  village development committees (VDCs); \n(ii)  municipal corporations, submunicipal corporations, and municipalities; and \n(iii)  town development boards (committees). \n \n2.  Plans of VDCs and municipalities must be approved by a board, or a higher authority if \nno board exists. The membership of a board is determined by the government. (Only 4 of the 18 \nmembers are democratically elected.) The government can alter the membership as it sees fit. \n \n3.  Local bodies have duties and functions under the Act, namely, to \n(i)  define land use zones; \n(ii)  set standards and norms; \n(iii)  conduct programs for proper development; \n(iv)  restrict development; \n(v)  conduct land development programs; \n(vi)  stop development or subdivision of land for a maximum period of 2 years; \n(vii)  regulate, control, or prohibit development; \n(viii)  impose conditions when granting approval for development; \n(ix)  require unauthorized development to be removed at no cost; and \n(x)  acquire land in its name for the purpose of town planning. \n \n4.  The Town Development Act provides an elaborate legal framework for executing town \nplanning. More specifically, for land development programs, the Act empowers a local body to \nconduct guided land development (GLD) and/or land pooling projects, and provides the means \nto overcome legal objections that may arise if such projects are implemented under the Local \nSelf-Governance Act. \n \n5.  For land pooling, it gives local bodies authority to \n(i)  recover management and capital costs through the sale of reserve plots; \n(ii)  conduct land pooling in any area required; \n(iii)  conduct land pooling in any area where 75% of the owners/tenants demand, \nproviding that more than 50 families reside in the area; \n(iv)  conduct land pooling through a user committee; \n(v)  prevent subdivision, sale, and development of land for 2 years while land \npooling is conducted; \n(vi)  use prevailing land values to determine contribution ratios; and \n(vii)  enable owners with plots that are too small to buy additional land.

A demand-driven approach with maximum local resources will be used in rural water \nsupply schemes. Nongovernment agencies, community-based organizations, and the \nprivate sector will be mobilized as partners in developing the sector. \n2.   Priority will be given to the use of appropriate simple technologies that the community \ncan support. Technologies like rainwater harvesting, solar pumps, hydrams, etc. will be \nused wherever a perennial water source is not available. \n3.   Effective  and  sustainable  development  will  be  achieved  by  strengthening \nimplementation, operation and maintenance (O&M), and leakage control arrangements \nby involving local users committees/agencies from the planning stage. \n4.   Priority  will  be  given  to  rehabilitating  yet-to-be-handed-over  old  rural  water  supply \nschemes and incomplete schemes. \n5.   A policy for developing and conserving water resources within a watershed area by \nintegrated use management of ground water and surface water sources will be adopted. \nInstitutional development for integrated use management of watersheds will be made to \nimprove and augment the water supply in Kathmandu Valley. \n6.   National  quality  guidelines  will  be  prepared  and  the  quality  monitoring  and  control \nsystem will be strengthened to provide safe water. \n7.   Emphasis will be put on the skills and capability of users committees or nongovernment \norganizations for implementing water supply schemes by mobilizing them. \n8.   Sanitation programs will be implemented parallel to the development of water supply \nschemes. Sewerage systems in densely populated areas and on-site sanitation in other \nareas shall be promoted. \n9.   Water supply schemes will be operated on cost recovery basis. In rural areas, a policy of \ncost recovery of O&M and users community operation will be adopted. Cost recovery of \ncapital cost along with O&M cost will be adopted in urban areas. \n10.   Besides encouraging private sector involvement in managing of water supply systems in \nurban  areas,  water  supply  services  will  be  developed  and  expanded  by  involving \nmunicipalities in the responsibility as provided for in Nepal\u2019s decentralization policy. \n11.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nSector identified as a National Priority in  Yes  Sector identified as a National Priority in  Yes \nCountry Poverty Analysis?   Country Poverty Partnership Agreement?  \n \nOver the last decade the number of absolutely poor has increased to 9 million in Nepal. That is approximately 45% of the \ntotal population (UNDP 1998). If $1 per day per capita is taken as the yardstick for measuring of poverty, the percent of \nthe poor in Nepal is 53%. The Nepal Living Standard Survey 1996 revealed that 42% of the population remained as \nabsolute poor. The 9th Plan (1997-2002) emphasizes poverty reduction as the sole development objective and it \nbecame a major agenda.  \nUntil recently, Nepal\u2019s economy has been based largely on rural agriculture. But as the country develops toward a more \nurban economy, it faces a number of special circumstances associated with environmental degradation, high-income \ninequalities, entrenched poverty, and formation of slums and squatter settlements. The main factors that have \ncontributed to the rapid rise in overall urban populations are high level of rural to urban migration, extension of municipal \nboundaries, and designation of new municipalities. Municipalities are growing at an average rate of 5.2%, while the \nnational population as a whole is growing at about 2.4%, indicating that Nepal could have half of its population living in \nmunicipal areas 3 decades from now (UNDP 2001). \nHowever, poverty in urbanizing Nepal is somewhat different since substantial portions of municipal areas and the \npopulation are, in fact, rural in both occupational structure and village settlement pattern. These villages and settlements \nin the municipalities lack basic infrastructure such as water supply, usable roads, drainage, solid waste collection \nservice, electricity, and accessible schools. When poor villages are incorporated into municipalities, they lose all district-\nlevel village support from government. Municipalities, which are supposed to assume this support, are largely unable to \ndo so due to low levels of revenue sources and lack of external support for programs focusing on the urban poor in \nNepal. \nGiven that substantial portions of the population in municipal areas are in fact rural in occupational structure, rural urban \nlinkages remain poor in most regions in terms of markets, transportation, information and service access. Poor farmers \nface high costs, inadequate information, and other barriers to agriculture and nonagriculture activities.  \nIn the project towns, about 51% of the sample households have access to piped water, 24% are using public standpipes, \nand the rest do not have access to safe drinking water. The water supply often is only intermittent. About one in three \nhouseholds faces a serious water shortage at least once a year, and about one in six all year around. Water quantity \ndelivered is mostly below 50 liters per capita per day. In addition water quality often falls below World Health \nOrganization standards for drinking water, mainly due to bacteriological contamination as a result of poor sanitation \nfacilities. Only about three quarters of the urban population have access to toilets while about a quarter are forced to \ndefecate in open spaces such as riverbanks, drainage, and fields. Sewerage systems, often combined with storm water \ndrainage systems, are limited in urban areas. The final treatment of sewage is often inadequate. As a result, rivers in \nurban areas have often practically become open sewers, especially in towns during the dry season. Most municipalities \ncollect only 50-60 % of the domestic solid waste generated, and the balance is often burned or disposed of haphazardly \non the roadside.  \nThe shortage of good quality water and inadequate sewage system have an adverse effect on public health and the \nurban environment. Given that women are mainly responsible for family health maintenance and collection of water, the \nlack of basic piped water supply facilities is a greater burden on women.  \n \nADB\u2019s country strategy for Nepal emphasizes water supply, sanitation and urban development, and the need to target \nexcluded groups, to reduce both poverty and inequality. The Project will foster institutional development in nine urban \nareas and will finance infrastructure improvements with a focus on water supply, sewerage/wastewater management, \nand  solid  waste  management  as  well  as  small  urban  infrastructure,  such  as  bus  terminal/bus  park,  market, \nslaughterhouse, and environmental awareness program. In addition, the Project will be linked with a parallel scheme on \nRural Urban Partnership Program (RUPP). The Project aims to improve living condition and health status of the people \nin project towns. Access to safe drinking water, improved sanitation and environment will reduce vulnerability to \nenvironmental hazards for the communities in the project towns. Improved quantities and quality of domestic water \nsupply and sanitation facilities will reduce morbidity and mortality factor for young children. Availability of safe drinking \nwater supply will reduce water-carrying time for women. Better environment in the urban area will improve the quality of \nhealth and productive capacity of the people. ", "38   Appendix 7 \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Proposed Classification \nSocioeconomic survey in the project towns indicates that a total of 22% of sample households belong to below poverty \nline. The distribution of poverty among the project towns is found to be unequal. The highest percentage of poor \nhouseholds (59%) is in Dhadingbesi, followed by Bidur (31%) and Ratnanagar (21%). Most of the poor households \nbelong to lower castes. Urban poverty in the project towns is multifaceted, ranging from lack of employment, basic \nservices, such as water supply and sanitation, to substandard housing. The proposed Project will provide water supplies \nto the poor and low-caste communities through public water stand posts. The sanitation and wastewater management \nsubcomponent will provide public toilets, expanded sewerage pipe networks and simple wastewater treatment plants in \nnine urban areas. The system will be designed to give the urban poor adequate access to improved sanitation. The \nexpected benefits are public hygiene and public health improvement in low-income areas of the project towns, and less \npollution of groundwater and surface water in these urban areas. The improved public health would contribute to a more \nproductive  labor  force.  The  community-based  solid  waste  management  and  recycling  component  would  create \nemployment for the urban poor. Socioeconomic survey data indicates that over 70% of the poor in all municipalities \nsuffered from lack of employment opportunities. The direct impact of the Project on poverty reduction will be through \nemployment generation in construction works.  \n In the project towns, 54% of the poor are employed in agriculture, while 26% are casual laborers. RUPP will develop \nlinkages between rural and urban producer groups to strengthen the local economy and enhance employment and \nincome-earning opportunities for the urban poor, low-caste people, and Daliths (lowest caste people). The producer \ngroups as well as urban petty vendors often face problems related to the market center, license for vending, space for \nvending cart, etc. RUPP would provide an improved market-place, collection centers, and market information to poor \nproducer groups and the vendors. These would help them compete with bigger markets and to increase income of the \nsmall producers and vendors. \n \n \nC.

To  strengthen  community \nparticipation in local level governance in the project towns, the Project will adopt the following measures: (i) community- \nlevel committees should be formed to undertake solid waste management and recycling of waste; (ii) water user \nassociation will include men and women from the communities; (iii) low-caste communities and ethnic minority groups \nwill be represented in the user committees for different project components; and (iv) producer groups will be formed. \nNongovernment  organizations/community-based  organizations  will  participate  in  implementing  the  solid  waste \nmanagement.

Introduction \n1.  In compliance with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB's) environmental requirements, \nan initial environmental examination (IEE) was conducted. This appendix covers the project \ntown of Hetauda as a representative sample for the nine project towns. For the initial screening, \nADB's checklist of environmental parameters for selected infrastructure development projects \nwas used. The potential major impacts or benefits of the Project were identified next and an \nanalysis of whether or not a further study was warranted followed. The summary IEE (SIEE) \nsummarizes the screening of potential environmental impacts of the Project, suggests mitigation \nmeasures, and describes the institutional requirements and environmental monitoring program. \nThe SIEE is based on information gathered during the feasibility study, a review of reports \navailable in the core subproject areas, and data collected during fact-finding by staff of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). The Project aims to address critical environmental improvement \nneeds by preparing subprojects to facilitate sustainable urban development in the municipality of \nHetauda. \n2.  The  subcomponents  concerned  with  urban  and  environmental  infrastructure \nimprovements are (i) sewage treatment, (ii) water supply, and (iii) urban land development. \n3.  The 1997 Environmental Protection Regulations stipulates that an IEE is necessary for \nthe subprojects. The land to be acquired for project activities is mostly agricultural land. The \ndevelopment of infrastructure will bring positive impacts. Temporary, limited negative impacts \nthat will occur during construction can easily be mitigated. \nB.  Description of the Subprojects \n1.  Sewage Treatment Plant \n4.  The system proposed is the constructed wetland (CW) system. CW is a biological \nwastewater  treatment  technology  designed  to  mimic  processes  found  in  natural  wetland \necosystems. These systems utilize wetland plants, soils, and their associated microorganisms \nto remove contaminants from wastewater. The basic features of CW are a bed of uniformly \ngraded sand or gravel with plants such as reeds growing on it. \n5.  The bed is lined with plastic or clay to prevent wastewater from leaching into the ground \nand polluting groundwater. Wastewater is evenly distributed on the bed and flows through it \neither horizontally or vertically. As the wastewater flows through the bed, it gets treated through \nnatural processes \u2013 potential pollutants in the wastewater stream are mechanically filtered, \nchemically transformed, and biologically consumed. \n2.  Water Supply \n6.  Details of the water supply subproject are summarized in the table. \nSewerage and Sewage Treatment  Water Supply \nCombined sewerage system will be used and the  Rehabilitation  of  3  existing \ntreated wastewater discharged into the river. Two  systems, including rehabilitation of \nCW  treatment  plants  proposed  with  capacities  of  an  existing  infiltration  gallery; \n341 and 808 cubic meters/day. Some land has to be  construction of a tube well, a water \npurchased.  Other  components  include  laying  of  treatment plant, and 4 reservoirs of \nabout 12.7 km sewers and cleaning of about 4.5 km  300-500  m3;  laying  transmission \nexisting drains and sewers  mains and distribution pipes ", "  Appendix 13  49 \nC.  Description of the Environment \n1.  Physical Resources \n7.  Hetauda is an inner terai municipality situated 76 kilometers (km) east of Bharatpur. The \nChure,  Mahabharat,  and  Chandragiri  mountain  ranges  run  from  south  to  north  of  the \nMakwanpur District and Hetauda lies south of the district. The elevation of the valley ranges \nfrom 300 to 600 meters (m) above mean sea level between the Mahabharat and Chure ranges. \nThe soil of the valley is made up of alluvium, gravel, boulder, sand, and clay. The climate of \nHetauda is tropical. The winter is dry and mild, and the summer hot and moist. Average annual \nrainfall (from the southwest monsoon) is 2,313 millimeters. There is plenty of surface water in \nHetauda. The main river is the Rapti, which enters Hetauda in a southwest direction  and is \njoined by the Karra and the Kukhreni Kholas. Rivers border the municipality on all sides. The \ngroundwater table fluctuates from 2 to 4 m. Groundwater is also used as a source of drinking \nwater. \n2.  Ecological Resources \n8.  There are endangered fauna species in the vicinity, but there is no threat to them during \nor after construction, since environmental improvements are proposed in the core urban areas. \nThe flora is dominated by tropical deciduous forests consisting of Shorea robusta, terminalia \ntomentosa, Dalbergia sisoo, Acacia catechu, and Adina cordifolia. Globally threatened birds in \nHetauda are the white-rumped vulture (Gyps bengalensis), long-billed vulture (Gyps indicus), \nand lesser adjutant (Leptoptilus javanicus). An endangered reptile species is the Indian python \n(Python morulus). \n3.  Human and Economic Development \n9.  The population of Hetauda is 68,482 (2001). The town is the rural areas service center, \nfor education, health, and commerce. It had been undergoing rapid industrialization, which \nslightly declined recently. Agriculture is still the main occupation. \n10.  The population served by piped water is 27%. The water is not of good quality due to \nlack of proper treatment. Household latrine coverage is 58%. There are no sewage treatment \nfacilities in the town and sewage is ultimately discharged into nearby rivers. Surface drainage is \npoor. The town is accessible by road, has power supply from the national grid, and has \ntelecommunication facilities and hospitals. \n4.  Quality of Life \n11.  Average household occupancy in Hetauda is 9.1 persons. Water supply, sanitation, and \ndrainage facilities are inadequate and pose an environmental health hazard. \nD.  Anticipated Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n12.  Screening of environmental impacts from the individual subprojects (sewage treatment \nand water supply) indicates that most interventions result in either positive or insignificantly \nadverse socioeconomic or environmental impacts. \n1.  Sewage Treatment \na.  Environmental Impacts due to Location \n13.  No adverse environmental impacts are foreseen due to project location. \nb.  Environmental Impacts due to Design \n14.  There should be no major adverse impacts on the environment with the biological \nwastewater treatment plants, since it would improve the health of the people. Furthermore, the \ntreatment system will be the CW system that uses reed beds that are aesthetically pleasant with \nno standing water for breeding mosquitoes, requires no electricity and mechanical equipment, ", "50  Appendix 13 \nand has removal efficiencies of more than 97% for BOD 5 and total suspended solids, and \nremoval rates of more than 99% for total coliforms, E-coli and streptococcus. \n15.  During design, the following aspects must be carefully looked into, planned, designed, \nand monitored: \n(i)  adequate capacity of the system, \n(ii)  adequate protection of groundwater with the use of an impermeable lining, and \n(iii)  proper sludge disposal. \n16.  Land acquisition will be necessary in the town. Government and ADB guidelines in \ncompensating for land acquired will be followed. \nc.  Environmental Impacts due to Construction \n17.  During construction of the sewerage/drainage system, care should be taken to minimize \nsoil erosion and disruption of traffic. The works of the contractors should be carefully monitored \nto  see  whether  they  are  following the environmental mitigation measures specified in the \ncontract documents (workers' safety, sanitation at camps, use of local people as far as possible, \nand avoidance of child labor). There will be no significant negative impact during construction of \nthe CW system since the technology is very simple (using gravity flow, gravel, sand, and reeds). \nd.  Environmental Impacts due to Operations \n18.  Inadequate monitoring of the effluent and management could lead to river pollution. \nMitigation measures to minimize adverse impacts will be to design an efficient impermeable \nlining system on the bottom of the reed beds to avoid groundwater pollution and to ensure \nproper operation and management training. \n19.  Positive impacts from sewage collection and treatment follow: \n(i)  The town will become neater and cleaner. \n(ii)  The rivers will be less polluted. \n(iii)  Tourists will be attracted, thereby generating revenue. \n(iv)  Health hazards are minimized. \n2.  Water Supply \n20.  Surface water and, to a very limited extent, groundwater are the water sources for the \nwater supply subcomponent in Hetauda. \na.  Environmental Impacts due to Location \n21.  There are no adverse environmental impacts due to project location in Hetauda. \n(i)  Resettlement is not required as the land for the deep tubewell and for the reservoirs \nbelongs to the municipality. \n(ii) No historical/cultural monuments exist around the sites for the deep tubewell and for \nthe reservoirs and along the routes of the transmission mains. \nb.  Environmental Impacts due to Design \n22.   If the following points are considered during the design phase, adverse environmental \nimpacts can be mitigated: \n(i)  The new tubewell should be well protected with good drainage (for surface sources). \nDistribution pipes should be kept away from drains so that drain water cannot \ninfiltrate the distribution system and contaminate drinking water. The town should \nalso have a good drainage system to avoid ponding. Sedimentation and filtration (for \nsurface water sources) and chlorination should be done so that appropriate residual \nchlorine is available. A monitoring plan should be prepared to regularly monitor the \ndistribution system for leaks and the availability of residual chlorine. ", "  Appendix 13  51 \n(ii) Sludge from sewage treatment plants should be disposed of properly on low lands. \nThe sludge disposal areas should be identified during design. \n(iii) Provision should be made for security fencing and good drainage and security \npersonnel at the intake, treatment, and reservoir sites. \n(iv) Trees should be planted around the compound to keep down any noise generated. \n(v) The  storage,  in-plant  handling  (occupational  health  hazards),  and  dosages  of \nchemicals must be addressed during the design phase, and procedures set up and \nguidelines developed for handling chlorine (both bleaching powder and gaseous \nchlorine) and first-aid measures in case of emergencies. \n(vi) The laying of transmission lines in trenches during construction will not lead to loss of \nprecious ecology, loss of environmental aesthetics and soil erosion, and damage to \nwater quality and land values, as the transmission line will be underground. Grass \nthat will be destroyed during construction in laying the mains will rapidly grow back. \nc.  Environmental Impacts due to Construction \n23.  Minor, temporary adverse impacts to the environment can occur, but the following \nmitigation measures can minimize the impacts: \n(i)  Precautionary measures should be taken during construction to avoid collapses \nwhen excavating for reservoirs and boring deep wells. All excavated material should \nbe  safely  disposed  of.  Excavated  trenches  should  be  backfilled  properly  and \nconstruction activities during the rainy season should, if possible, be minimized. \n(ii) Safety measures for workers, especially during construction of the reservoir, should \nbe  considered.  The  contractor  should  be  responsible  for  all  safety  measures, \nespecially eye protection, safe handling of chemicals, provision of hard hats and \nsafety boots, and sanitation in the camps. As far as possible, local labor should be \nhired. The site manager should properly monitor the construction activities of the \ncontractor  to  ensure  that  the  mitigation  measures  specified  in  the  contract \ndocuments are followed. \nd.  Environmental Impacts due to Operations \n24.  Minor adverse impacts could occur during the regular operation of the system, but they \ncan be avoided by adequate staff training and operational supervision. \nE.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program \n25.  As Executing Agency, the Ministry of Physical Planning and Works (MPPW) will be \nresponsible  for  coordinating  and  implementing  the  Project.  The  Department  of  Urban \nDevelopment and Building Construction (DUDBC) under MPPW will be the primary Government \nagency responsible for project implementation. \n26.  The  Project  has  been  prepared  using  community  participation  at  all  stages  of \ndevelopment, and it promotes implementation through nongovernment organizations (NGOs), \ncommunity-based  organizations  (CBOs),  and  the  private  sector,  wherever  feasible  and \nappropriate. The municipality will be the Implementing Agency for all the components, except for \nthe capacity building component. A full-time project advisor (PA) will advise on all technical \naspects, and assist with recruiting consulting services and other implementation activities. \n1.  Environmental Procedures and Institutions \n27.  The Government has  in  recent  years  felt  the  importance  of  environmental  impact \nassessment (EIA) and made it mandatory for development programs. Separate environmental \nguidelines for some sectors have been formulated and implemented. The Ministry of Population \nand Environment (MOPE) was established in 1996, and the Environment Protection Act (1997) \nand the Environmental Protection Regulations (1997) have been promulgated. Furthermore, the \nfirst amendment to the regulations took effect on 5 April 1999. ", "52  Appendix 13 \n28.  Besides  MOPE,  which  is  in  charge  of  environmental  management  for  all  sectoral \nagencies, MPPW has overall responsibility for environmental monitoring of all subprojects. \nMOPE gives final approval to an EIA. MPPW gives it to an IEE. \n29.  The town will need to establish two units for water supply, and sewerage and sewage \ntreatment plant with adequately qualified staff to operate, maintain, and regularly monitor the \nsystems. The human resources required to effectively run the systems have been identified and \nsecured. \n2.  Environmental Monitoring and Management Plan \n30.  The environmental monitoring and management plan (EMMP) will be so designed that \nthe contractor is monitored during the construction phase to see that the work is done according \nto the contract documents in which mitigation measures are specified. The EMMP will also \nrequire regular monitoring of the actual environmental impacts during project operations over \nthe  years  following  project  completion.  The  Social  and  Environmental  Division  of  the \nmunicipality will be in charge of this monitoring. Impacts that are monitored will be compared \nwith the anticipated impacts. The town will be equipped with a portable water quality testing kit \nto regularly monitor water and wastewater qualities. The details, extent, and frequency of testing \nwill be determined at the detailed design stage. \n3.  Implementation of the EMMP \na.  During Design \n31.  EMMP monitoring activities will become a regular part of the town's activities. During the \ndesign phase, the project coordination office, PA, supported by his consultant, will ensure that \nmitigation measures are included in the design and the contract documents in compliance with \nthe Environmental Protection Act and Regulations. \nb.  During Construction \n32.  The supervising officers concerned and contractors will ensure that works carried out are \naccording to the contract documents and that mitigation measures are carried out accordingly, \nwith the overall guidance of PA and PCO. \nc.  After Construction \n33.  The  parties  that  will  be  responsible  during  the  postconstruction  phase  are  the \nestablished  units  (water  supply  and  sewerage)  that  would  regularly  monitor  the  systems, \nprepare monthly reports, and carry out necessary remedial actions. The staff of each unit will be \nadequately trained to look after the systems, environmental issues, and monitoring aspects so \nas to comply with environmental regulations. \nF.  Findings and Recommendations \n34.  The subprojects for Hetauda are expected to have only negligible negative impacts on \nthe environment. Such impacts will be mitigated through adequate measures and regular \nmonitoring during the design, construction, and operation phases. The Project is expected to \nbring about significant improvements in personal, household, and community hygiene and in \nenvironmental sanitation, thereby enhancing the quality of life. \nG.  Conclusion \n35.  The individual IEE conducted shows no adverse or harmful impacts of any significance \nare expected and, therefore, full-scale EIA is not required for any of the subprojects. ", "  Appendix 14  53 \nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSES AND FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY \nA.  General \n1.  Economic and financial analyses conducted under the project preparatory technical \nassistance were reviewed and revised in accordance with the Asian Development Bank's \n(ADB\u2019s) Framework for the Economic and  Financial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector \nProjects. Economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) were calculated for major subcomponents in \nthe nine project towns, using ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. For \nrevenue-generating  components,  financial  internal  rates  of  return  (FIRRs)  were  calculated \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial Analysis of Projects. Financial sustainability of the \ntowns was assessed based on the Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of \nInvestment Projects Financed by the Asian Development Bank. \nB.  Economic Analysis \n2.  The estimated costs and benefits of major subprojects1 were valued at their economic \nprices using the domestic price numeraire, which adjusts border price equivalent values to their \nequivalent domestic prices and entails the application of shadow price adjustments to convert \nthe estimated financial costs to their equivalents. Taxes and duties were excluded, a standard \nexchange rate factor of 1.11 was applied to the price of tradable goods, and a shadow wage \nrate factor of 0.70 was used to adjust for underemployment in the country.2 \n \n3.  The economic analysis is divided into water supply subprojects for five project towns, \nand  other  infrastructure  and  service  improvement  subprojects  including  sanitation  and \nwastewater management, neighborhood road, drainage, and water supply development, river \ntraining, road upgrading, and supplementary urban facilities. \n1.  Water Supply  \n4.  The assumptions in the economic analysis of water supply follow. The capital and \noperation and maintenance (O&M) costs are based on the design capacity requirements in the \nplanning period of 20 years. A capital allowance equivalent to 10% of the total capital cost is \nmade every 10 years to cover the cost of replacing the pump and other equipment, in addition to \nthe ordinary O&M expenditures for pressurized schemes. For gravity schemes, an allowance of \n2% every 10 years is provided for capital replacement. Water meters for pressurized schemes \nare assumed to be replaced every 7 years. A residual value equivalent to 50% of project costs \nis assumed in year 20 to take account of the remaining economic life of the civil works and \npipelines, which have an assumed economic life of 40 years. The major O&M costs for each \nsubproject are (i) operation, (ii) personnel, (iii) power, and (iv) maintenance. \n5.  Table A13.1 presents a summary of the base case EIRRs, the economic net present \nvalues at a 12% discount rate, and the average incremental economic cost (AIEC) per unit of \nwater sold in the five project towns that have a water supply subproject. The AIEC provides a \nmeasure of the cost per cubic meter of the proposed subprojects and indicates tariffs needed to \nmeet full cost recovery for water supply. The AIEC is the discounted value of incremental capital \ncosts and operating costs (in economic prices) over a 20-year period divided by the discounted \nvalue of incremental quantity of water sales as a result of the proposed investment. Capital \n                                                 \n1  In accordance with the Asian Development Bank's Framework for the Economic and Financial Appraisal of Urban \nDevelopment Sector Projects, smaller subprojects such as bus terminal and market improvements were not \nsubjected to a detailed economic internal rate of return analysis, but were examined using the cost-effectiveness \ncriteria. \n2  These adjustment factors are consistent with those used in other ADB-funded projects in Nepal such as the Small \nTowns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project approved in September 2000. ", "54  Appendix 14 \ncosts include economic cost of the water supply subprojects. The discount rate used is the \nsocial opportunity cost of capital (SOCC) estimated at 12%. \nTable A14.1: Summary of Economic Evaluation for Water Supply \nTown  EIRR (%)  ENPV  AIEC \n(NRs million)  (NRs/m3) \nBanepa  28.9  163.13  31.80 \nPanauti  25.1  101.13  28.52 \nDhulikel  22.3  118.74  51.38 \nBharatpur  22.6  141.42  17.07 \nHetauda  23.0  92.76  20.67 \nAIEC = average incremental economic cost, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, \nENPV = economic net present values. \n \n6.  Table A13.2 summarizes the sensitivity of the results tested in different scenarios. It is \nnoted that even in the worst-case scenario, which combines a 10% decrease in benefits and \n10% increase in costs, all subprojects are still viable with EIRRs above 12.0%. The economic \nbenefits are generally less sensitive to capital costs and O&M than to benefit streams. These \nresults indicate that the success of the Project will depend heavily on the realization of the \nbenefit streams. \n \nTable A14.2: Summary of the Sensitivity Analyses for Water Supply  \nTown  EIRR and  Base  Capital Cost  O&M Cost +  Capital and  Benefits   \nSI  Case  +10%  10%  O&M Cost  \u201310%   \n+10% (1)  (2)  (1) + (2) \nBanepa  EIRR (%)  28.9  26.9  28.8  26.8  26.6  24.6 \n  SI    0.69  0.05  0.73  0.80  1.49 \n  SV (%)    146.00  2165.00  137.00  124.00  67.00 \nPanauti  EIRR (%)  25.1  23.4  25.0  23.3  23.1  21.5 \n  SI    0.67  0.05  0.71  0.78  1.45 \n  SV (%)    150.00  2172.00  141.00  128.00  69.00 \nDhulikel  EIRR (%)  22.3  20.6  22.2  20.6  20.4  18.8 \n  SI    2.44  1.86  2.46  2.53  3.12 \n  SV (%)    41.00  54.00  41.00  40.00  32.00 \nBharatpur  EIRR (%)  22.6  20.9  22.1  20.5  20.3  18.3 \n  SI    0.73  0.19  0.91  1.00  1.88 \n  SV (%)    138.00  516.00  110.00  100.00  53.00 \nHetauda  EIRR (%)  23.0  21.2  22.7  20.9  20.7  18.7 \n  SI    0.77  0.14  0.91  1.00  1.87 \n  SV    129.00  720.00  110.00  100.00  54.00 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, O&M = operation and maintenance, SI = sensitivity indicator (percentage \nchange in EIRR/ percentage change in variable tested), SV = switching value (percentage of present value of net \nbenefits to the present value of a variable using a discount rate of 12%). \n2.  Other Project Components \na.  Sanitation and Wastewater Management Subprojects \n7.  The sanitation and wastewater management subprojects were subjected to least-cost \nanalysis. Sanitation improvements that include sewage collection and reed bed treatment are \nconsidered. Collection and off-site treatment are necessary because the density of population in \nthe municipalities makes it impractical to install septic tanks. For the least-cost analysis, the \nsewage collection/reed bed wastewater treatment and the sewerage collection/conventional \nwastewater treatment are compared. ", "  Appendix 14  55 \n8.  For the municipalities of Banepa, Panauti, Hetauda, and Bharatpur, information and cost \nestimates  of  sanitation  projects  together  with  water  use  and  significant  amount  of  cost \ninformation for water systems were available. For the five other municipalities, information on \nsanitation  projects  was  available,  but  there  was  no  data  on  water  use.  The  cost  of  the \nconventional treatment plant was based on earlier studies of a wastewater treatment plant for \nKathmandu in 2000. The unit cost was adjusted for inflation to arrive at the present rate of \nNRs13,400 for construction of a wastewater treatment plant with capacity of 1 m3/day. \n  Table A14.3: Summary of Sanitation Least Cost Analysis  (NRs million) \nTown  Sewerage System with Reed  Sewerage System with  Least-Cost \nBed Treatment  Conventional Treatment  Option \nCapital  O&M  NPV  Capital  O&M Cost  NPV \nCost  Cost  Cost  (2009) \n(2009) \nBanepa  113.77  0.73   93.85  108.27  1.73   94.95  Reed Bed \nDhulikhel  106.83  0.60   87.65  102.33  1.37   88.10  Reed Bed \nPanauti   49.42  0.46   41.55   46.32  1.09   42.36  Reed Bed \nBharatpur  137.42  0.70  112.37  133.09  1.54  113.20  Reed Bed \nRatnanagar   92.29  0.55   75.90   89.14  1.18   76.67  Reed Bed \nHetauda  117.51  0.61   96.17  111.89  1.48   96.34  Reed Bed \nBidur    5.52  0.21    5.45     4.30  0.40    5.51  Reed Bed \nKamalamai    4.96  0.17    4.80     4.33  0.39    5.51  Reed Bed \nDhadingbesi    6.82  0.31    7.04     5.64  0.47    6.96  Conventional \nTreatment \nNPV = net present value, O&M = operation and maintenance. \n \n9.  Table A13.3 shows the result of sanitation least-cost analysis with reed bed treatment \nsystem as the least-cost option for all towns except Dhadingbesi where the conventional \nwastewater treatment system is the least-cost. \n \n10.  Furthermore, past experience in operating a wastewater treatment plant in Nepal shows \nthat O&M costs and ease of operation with minimum use of electromechanical equipment are \ncrucial for sustainable operation. Because the reed bed wastewater treatment system meets \nthese requirements, in addition to being less expensive than the conventional system in most of \nthe project towns, it was adopted for the Project. The analysis shows that revenue from \nsewerage is sufficient to meet its O&M cost. \nb.  River Training Subprojects \n11.  River  training  involves  construction  of  embankments  to  protect  against  erosion  in \nBharatpur, Hetauda, and Kamalamai. River training in the three project towns will benefit these \nareas: low-lying land on the Rapti river at wards 1 and 11 and on Karra River at ward 4 in \nHetauda; low-lying land on the Narayani River in Bharatpur; and an old settlement area in Dhura \nbazaar and sports ground in Kamalamai. Recent damages as a result of heavy flooding include \nloss of land along Karra River in Hetauda, limited use of low-lying land in Bharatpur, and loss of \nland and crop at sports ground in Kamalamai. \n12.  River training is the least-cost approach and is primarily based on the rates of gabion \nworks available from the UN Park Development Project in Kathmandu. The length of the \nprotective embankment is 1.50 kilometers (km) for Bharatpur, 0.75 km for Hetauda, and 0.29 km \nfor Kamalamai. Two gabion boxes 3.5 meters (m) wide x 1.0 m long x 0.30 m high will be placed \nadjacent to each other to cover the riverbed 7.0-meter-wide. The embankment is 2.27 m high. ", "56  Appendix 14 \nThe inclined side of the embankment is 3.79 m and consists of earth filling at the base, 0.30 m \ndry stone pitching in the middle layer, and reinforced concrete rib as the top layer. \nc.  Road Upgrading Subprojects \n13.  Road  upgrading  involves  blacktopping  the  earthen  road  in  Banepa,  Dhulikhel,  and \nRatnanagar, based on the priority lists provided by the towns. The coverage varies. In Banepa, \nthe six roads to be covered are 1.6 km along Sahidmarg road, 1.4 km along Bhakteshwormarg \nroad,  1.0  km  along  Rajdasmarg  road,  1.0  km  along  Bhimsenmarg  road,  0.25  km  along \nLaxchcheshwarmarg road, and 0.25 km along Shreekhandamarga road. In Dhulikhel, the two \nroads to be covered are 3.0 km along Shreekhandapur and 1.0 km along Charandada. In \nRatnanagar, the road to be covered is 4.0 km along Bagmara Souharar. The existing gravel \nroads cause slow flow of traffic. \n14.  The cost of road upgrading is based on the least-cost approach and the unit costs of \nroads are based on cost per km of recent Department of Roads projects. In Banepa, the width \nof the six roads is uniform at 4.5 m. In Dhulikhel, one road is 8.0 m wide and another road is \n4.5 m wide. In Ratnanagar, the road is 8.0 m wide. The scarified, leveled, and compacted \nexisting surface will be covered with a 0.15 m subbase course of gravel packing, 0.20 m base \ncourse of gravel packing, and 0.05 m dense graded asphalt concrete topping. \nC.  Distribution and Poverty Impact Analysis \n15.  Poverty impact analysis was carried out at these three stages: analysis of subproject \nbeneficiaries, analysis of the distribution of benefits, and poverty impact analysis. \n1.  Analysis of Subproject Beneficiaries \n16.  Benefits from the water supply subproject will be the lower cost of water and the \nexpected increase in consumption valued in financial prices/tariffs. The consumers will also \nbenefit from the economic value of nonphysical losses avoided. Where the financial cost of \nlabor exceeds its opportunity cost, the difference accrues as a gain to the laborers (unskilled \nlabor), in both construction and operation phases of the subproject. \n17.  The economy loses where economic costs exceed financial costs and economic costs \ninclude cost of the sewerage subproject. There is a loss to the utility because not all of the full \nfinancial costs, including capital costs, are recovered where financial tariffs/revenues are less \nthan economic benefits. \n2.  Distribution Analysis of Benefits \n18.  Distribution analysis is used to identify more closely those who gain from the project \nbenefits and to serve as a basis for the poverty impact analysis. For the purpose of distribution \nanalysis, both financial and economic costs are discounted at the economic opportunity cost of \ncapital of 12%. The main participants are the government, the utility, the consumers, and labor. \n3.  Poverty Impact Analysis \n19.  Having allocated economic benefits to different groups in the economy, it is time to \nestimate the proportion of benefits accruing to the poor. It is necessary to assess the proportion \nof Government expenditure reaching the poor, defined as those living below the poverty line. An \nassessment  of  government  expenditure  assumes  that,  on  average,  around  14.75%  of  all \nGovernment's expenditure reaches the poor. (Refer to ADB's draft poverty handbook calculation \nfor Nepal.) \n20.  Losses  to  the  Government/economy  reduce  available  Government  funds,  thereby \ndecreasing Government expenditures directly targeted to the needs of the poor. ", "  Appendix 14  57 \n21.  It is necessary to estimate the proportion of unskilled labor for a subproject that could be \nsupplied by the poor in each respective town. It is estimated that the poor will provide 70% of \nunskilled labor in the construction and operational phases. \n22.  It is necessary to estimate that proportion of the poor that would become customers of \nthe utility. Because the project covers urban areas where there is presently no water supply and \nis targeted to these poorer urban sections of the towns, it is assumed that there will be more \npoor customers among those representing the number of new connections. Therefore, for the \npurposes of the analysis, it is estimated that the proportion of poor people receiving supply is \n20% greater than the average level of poor people in the municipality. \n4.  Poverty Impact Ratio \n23.  Table A13.4 shows the results of poverty impact analysis for the five project towns with a \nwater supply subproject. The poor benefit as consumers and as labor providers, but will face \npart of the costs of the Project through the costs borne by government. A poverty impact ratio \n(PIR), expressing the proportion of net economic benefits accruing to the poor, is calculated by \ncomparing the net economic benefits to the poor with the net economic benefits to the economy \nas a whole. The poverty impact ratio for all but two towns is greater than the share of the poor in \nthe overall gross domestic product (GDP) of 14.75%. \n \nTable A14.4: Net Benefit Accruing to the Poor through Consumption, \nGovernment, and Labor and the Poverty Impact Ratio for the Towns \nLabor \nTown  Consumers  Government  (in NRs million)  PIR \nBanepa  192  -1.0  6.0  0.29 \nDhulikhel  163  -4.0  8.0  0.28 \nPanauti  123  -2.0  0.5  0.28 \nBhatatpur  139  -39.0  0.0  0.14 \nHetauda  141  -11.0  1.0  0.10 \nD.  Financial Analysis \n24.  Basic assumptions used in computing the FIRRs include the following: (i) all revenues \nand costs are expressed in constant September 2002 prices on an incremental basis; (ii) project \ninvestment costs were derived from estimated costs, less price contingencies and interest \nduring construction; and (iii) capital expenditures are recorded at the time they are incurred, \nwhile interest and depreciation are excluded. \n1.  Water Supply \n25.  The purpose of the financial cost-benefit analysis is to assess the financial viability of the \nproposed subproject. It focuses on the additional financial benefits (usually in terms of additional \nrevenues, and capital and operating cost savings or reductions) attributable to the subproject for \nthe prospective operating entities, rather than the economy as a whole. The resulting FIRR \nindicates the profitability of the subproject (Table A13.5), and should exceed the weighted \naverage cost of capital (WACC) to be financially viable. The WACC of the water supply \ncomponents is estimated to be 4.6%.

The benefit \nstreams are the revenues derived from water sales to domestic and nondomestic customers \nbased on the tariffs for five project towns as discussed at the stakeholders meeting on 27 July \n2001 and 4 September 2002 and revised to recover costs. Average tariffs per cubic meter are \nset to cover O&M costs, repayment of 30% of initial capital costs, plus capital replacement \ncosts. \n27.  Revenues are derived from water sales from private taps, assuming full plumbing (100 \nlitres per capita per day [lcd]) and yard taps (60-65 lcd), and public taps and commercial sales. \nIn the case of public taps, households are assumed to pay the basic rate. Nondomestic \ncustomers are assumed to pay the upper rate. Institutional customers are treated as domestic \ncustomers. An allowance of 2.5% for bad debts is assumed on the small systems for Banepa, \nPanauti, and Dhulikhel, and 10% for the larger systems of Hetauda, and Bharatpur. \n28.  The capital costs include the cost of connections and meters. Customers are expected \nto bear these costs through their 20% contribution to system development costs. As a minimum, \ncustomers are assumed to meet the cost of connection of NRs2,400 per household. \n29.  Table A13.6 shows FIRRs ranging from 6.5% for Dhulikhel to 9.0% for Bharatpur. The \nwater supply subprojects for the five towns were found to be financially viable with base case \nFIRRs exceeding the calculated WACC of 4.6%. The sensitivity analysis showed that even in \nthe worst case scenario, the FIRRs for all five Project towns met the minimum WACC of 4.6%. \nTable A14.6: Summary of the FIRRs (%) for Water Supply \nTown  Base Case  Capital  O&M Cost  Capital and  Benefits   \nCost +10%  + 10%  O&M Cost  - 10%   \n+10% (1)  (2)  (1) + (2) \nBanepa  7.3  6.5  7.1  6.3  6.2  5.3 \nPanauti  7.2  6.5  7.0  6.2  6.1  5.2 \nDhulikhel  6.5  5.8  6.4  5.7  5.6  4.7 \nBharatpur  9.0  8.1  8.7  7.8  7.6  6.4 \nHetauda  7.0  6.1  6.7  5.9  5.8  4.7 \nO&M = operation and maintenance. \n2.  Tariff Structures, Average Monthly Water Bills, and Affordability \na.  Tariff Structures \n30.  Table  A13.7  summarizes  the  tariff  structure,  average  monthly  water  bills,  and \naffordability. Tariffs have been set with affordability in mind and on the assumption that the \nwater utility must maintain a positive cash flow from operations throughout the forecast period. \nThis essentially means that average tariffs set for the forecast period must generate sufficient ", "  Appendix 14  59 \nfunds  to  cover  operating  costs  and  debt  service  as  well  as  to  meet  the  costs  of  meter \nreplacement  or  rehabilitation  (commencing  in  year  7  and  estimated  at  NRs1,350  per \nconnection) and replacement of mechanical and electric equipment (estimated at 10% of initial \ncapital costs in year 10). Table A13.7 sets out the average tariff to be paid by a consumer \nconsuming  100  lcd  for  the  average  income  household  and  60-65 lcd  for  the  low  income \nhousehold. \nTable A14.7: Tariff Structure, Monthly Water Bills, and Affordability \n  Banepa  Panauti  Dhulikhel  Bharatpur  Hetauda \nProposed Water Tariff           \nIncrease (NRs/m3) \n0 - 10 m3   5.0(cid:224)15.5  5.0(cid:224)16.0  5.0(cid:224)16.0  5.0(cid:224)10.0  5.0(cid:224)11.0 \n> 10 m3   11.9(cid:224)30.0  11.9(cid:224)30.0  6.0(cid:224)45.0  11.9(cid:224)15.0  11.9(cid:224)18.0 \nAverage   22.0  19.0  33.0  11.0  13.0 \nWater Consumption           \n(m3/mo) \nAverage HH   27.0  22.0  22.0  22.0  18.0 \nLow Income HH  9.0  10.0  10.0  13.0  12.0 \nWater Bill (NRs/HH/mo)           \nAverage HH   665.0  520.0  700.0  280.0  254.0 \nLow-Income HH  139.5  160.0  160.0  145.0  146.0 \nAffordability (%HH Income)           \nAverage HH   9.6  6.5  8.7  2.6  3.1 \nLow-Income HH  5.0  4.9  4.9  5.0  4.2 \nHH = household, m3 = cubic meter. \nb.  Affordability \n31.  For  an  average-income  household  in  Banepa,  the  monthly  payment  of  NRs665 \nrepresents 9.6% of household income. In Bharatpur, NRs280 per month represents 2.6% of \nhousehold income. In low-income households, the income spent on water bills of NRs146 and \nNRs140  represents  4.2%  in  Hetauda  and  5.0%  in  Banepa.  The  large  household  size  in \nBharatpur means that a low-income household\u2019s water bill for 13 m3 would represent 5% of \nhousehold income. The results are within the accepted guidelines of affordability where monthly \ncharges are regarded as affordable up to 5% - 6% of monthly household income for low-income \nhouseholds. \n \nE.  Financial Capability of Implementing Agencies \n32.  A financial capability analysis was carried out for the proposed implementing agencies of \nthe Project. Financial projections for the towns were prepared for the period FY2003 - FY2022. \nThe financial projections include proposals for improved revenue generation from, in particular, \nthe land and property tax as part of municipal institutional strengthening. For the five project \ntowns  that  have  water  supply  subprojects,  the  financial  projections  for  the  water  supply \nsubprojects were carried out separately. \n33.  The projections assume increases in tax rates, increases in collection efficiency, and \nsome modest increase in levels of housing stock into higher value brackets over the forecast \nperiod. The integrated property tax increases from NRs200 per year in 2003 to NRs400 per year \nin 2004 and NRs500 per year in 2005 for properties valued at less than NRs 1 million. Rates for \nrural households are assumed at 20% of urban rates and reflect a lower level of municipal \nservices provided, but the rate will increase from NRs40 per year in 2003 to Rs80 per year in \n2004 and NRs100 per year in 2007. Collection efficiency is expected to improve over the ", "60  Appendix 14 \nprojection period. By 2010, it is assumed that all project towns collect 90% of potential/gross \nrevenues. With institutional strengthening and capacity building leading to increased revenue \ngeneration  through  introduction  of  property-based  taxes  and  more  efficient  collection,  the \nfinancial projections show that financing for the Project, especially debt servicing, is within the \ncapacity of each project town. \n34.  The local development tax is assumed to continue at present levels and to remain as the \nmajor  source  of  revenues  over  the  projection  period.  Professional  or  business  taxes  are \nassumed to represent a major future source of revenue with improved collection and higher tax \nrates. Through the increased effort to formulate, bill, and collect business taxes to support \nmunicipal activities, the professional or business taxes are expected to increase by six-fold over \nand above the expected GDP growth, assumed at 5% per annum over the next 5 years. \n35.  Other existing municipal taxes and fees are assumed to increase in real terms, in line \nwith GDP growth at 5% per annum. \n36.  It is assumed that households connected to the wastewater system would pay a monthly \ncharge of NRs20 in eight municipalities and NRs10 in Dhadingbesi in line with the willingness to \npay. Commercial customers would also be connected and hotels would be charged on people \nequivalents on the basis of average occupancy. For the neighborhood road, drainage, and \nwater supply development subprojects, the funds for loan repayment would be provided through \nsales of reserve plots. \n37.  On the basis of the preceding assumptions, revenues rise faster than operating costs, \nproviding surplus funds to contribute to capital expenditures and debt repayment. By 2010, it is \nassumed that all participating project towns are levying property taxes at the proposed levels \nand achieving a collection efficiency of 90%. With current population growth rates and higher \nproperty values, all project towns are expected to have surplus cash on hand by FY2020. \n "], "metadata": {"Creator": "R294-02_Cover - Microsoft Word", "CreationDate": "D:20021121123116Z", "Title": "R294-02_Cover", "Author": "rsa", "Producer": "Acrobat PDFWriter 4.0 for Windows NT", "ModDate": "D:20030131153831+08'00'"}, "author_page": "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 October 2002) \n \nCurrency Unit  \u2013  Nepalese rupee (NRe/NRs) \nNRe1.00  =  $0.013     \n$1.00  =  NRs76.73     \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  CBO  \u2013  community-based organization \n  DUDBC  \u2013  Department of Urban Development and Building Construction, \nMPPW \n  EA  \u2013  executing agency \n  EIA  \u2013  environmental impact assessment \n  EIRR  \u2013  economic internal rate of return \n  FIRR  \u2013  financial internal rate of return \n  GTZ  \u2013  Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (German Agency \nfor Technical Cooperation) \n  IA  \u2013  implementing agency \n  ICB  \u2013  international competitive bidding \n  IEE  \u2013  initial environmental examination \n  KfW  \u2013  Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (German Development Bank) \n  LCB  \u2013  local competitive bidding \n  Lcd  \u2013  litres per capita per day \n  MOF  \u2013  Ministry of Finance \n  MOPE  \u2013  Ministry of Population and Environment \n  MPPW  \u2013  Ministry of Physical Planning and Works \n  NWSC  \u2013  Nepal Water Supply Corporation \n  O&M  \u2013  operation and maintenance \n  PA  \u2013  project advisor \n  PCO  \u2013  project coordination office \n  PIU  \u2013  project implementation unit \n  PPMS  \u2013  project performance monitoring system \n  RUPP  \u2013  Rural-Urban Partnership Program \n  TDF  \u2013  Town Development Fund \n  UEIP  \u2013  Urban and Environmental Improvement Project \n  UNDP  \u2013  United Nations Development Programme \n  VDC  \u2013  village development committee \n  WACC  \u2013  weighted average of capital cost \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 15 July.
