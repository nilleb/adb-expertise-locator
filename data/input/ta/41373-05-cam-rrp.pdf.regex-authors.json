I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Kingdom of Cambodia, for subprogram 2 of the \nPublic Financial Management for Rural Development Program (PFMRDP); and (iii) a proposed \ngrant for institutional and capacity building. \n2.     The program\u2019s objective is to assist in implementing public financial management (PFM) \nreforms in three rural development ministries, including support to strengthen the capacity of the \nNational  Audit  Authority  (NAA).  The  program  and  related  project  will  improve  the  overall \ngovernance framework and support government efforts to meet PFM benchmarks essential to \nallocating  resources  efficiently  and  managing  expenditures  effectively,  transparently,  and \naccountably.   \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  High rural poverty. In Cambodia, 85% of the population lives in rural areas, where the \nmain source of livelihood and income is agriculture. About 73.5% of agricultural workers in rural \nareas are women. The recent robust economic growth reduced the overall poverty rate from \n47.0% in 1997 to 27.5% in 2008. However, the incidence of rural poverty is 35% compared with \n22% in urban areas. Rural poor have limited access to basic goods and services. Only about \n16% of rural households have effective irrigation systems and only about 25% have access to \nimproved water sources.  \n \n4.  Agriculture is essential to rural development. Employing 70% of the rural population \nand accounting for about one-third of gross domestic product (GDP), agriculture is an important \nsource  of  jobs,  enterprise  formation,  and  poverty  reduction.  However,  the  sector  remains \nvulnerable  to  external  shocks  and  unfavorable  weather  conditions.  The  potential  of  the \nagriculture sector needs to be developed, and investment in sector infrastructure is required to \nimprove productivity and reduce the vulnerability of rural populations to the effects of climate \nchange.  Cambodia\u2019s  agriculture  is  characterized  by  lower  inputs  in  terms  of  fertilizers, \nmachinery, irrigation, and extension services than its neighboring countries. This reflects the low \nlevel of private and public investment as well as external financing. Despite significant increases \nsince 1993,1 Cambodia\u2019s rice yield remains the lowest in the region. While agriculture accounts \nfor  59%  of  all  employment,  agro-industry  provides  less  than  1%  of  total  employment  and \naccounts for only 1.9% of GDP. Cambodia\u2019s share of agriculture value added in GDP has \ndeclined since 1993 because of the expansion of the industry and service sectors. The global \neconomic crisis is exacerbating the vulnerability of Cambodia's narrow economic base, which \nrelies heavily on the garment industry, tourism services, and construction.2 Climate change is \nhaving  a  significant  impact  on  agriculture  and  natural  resources.3 Improvements  in  water \nproductivity will likely be vital for Cambodia, because rainfall will be more variable and its spatial \ndistribution will be changed. Better water harvesting, storage, and management will be needed. \n \n                                                 \n1  The yield was 2.75 tons per hectare in 2008. \n2  These account for 42% of non-agriculture GDP. \n3  R. Wassmann, Y. Hosen, and K. Sumpleth. 2009. Agriculture and Climate Change: An Agenda for Negotiation in \nCopenhagen (for Food, Agriculture, and the Environment Overview). International Food Policy Research Institute. \nWashington D. C. (May). ", "2   \n5.  Rural development is a government priority. Growth in rural areas is a key thrust of \nthe government's development strategy. Much more investment in the sector will be needed to \nraise agriculture productivity, but line ministries are underfunded and institutionally weak. The \ngovernment's  sector-related  strategies  and  programs  target  implementing  the  Rectangular \nStrategy to promote rural development and help achieve the Millennium Development Goals.4 \nThe three line ministries that support rural development in Cambodia\u2014the Ministry of Rural \nDevelopment  (MRD);  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Forestry  and  Fisheries  (MAFF);  and  the \nMinistry of Water Resources and Meteorology (MOWRAM)\u2014are among the most underfunded. \nThis hinders the delivery of services to the poor. At about 11.5% of GDP, government revenue \nis lower than in other developing countries in Asia (16.0% of GDP). Accurately estimating what \nportion of public resources goes to rural development or the rural population is very difficult. \nHowever, about 3.3% of recurrent budget allocations are provided to the three ministries (known \nas the rural development ministries), an increase from 0.5% in the mid-1990s. While the level of \nexpenditure has increased from the 1990s, the resources allocated to this sector continue to be \ninsufficient. Spending on agriculture by development partners has also been low, generally \nabout $30 million\u2013$40 million of a total of $500 million\u2013600 million (or 5%\u20137%).  \n \n6.  Underfunded  budgets  exacerbate  public  expenditure  inefficiencies.  The  three \nprogram ministries use an incremental approach to planning and budgeting that limits their \nexpenditures to new and predominantly investment projects financed by development partners. \nThey suffer from weak coordination mechanisms within and across ministries, and tend to \noperate within \u201cpolicy silos\". Despite recent initiatives, such as the joint strategic plan for water \nand agriculture, policies overlap in many areas. Furthermore, the 2003 and the ongoing 2010 \nintegrated fiduciary assessment and public expenditure review, and the 2007 governance risk \nassessments of the MRD and the MOWRAM, stressed the need for substantial improvements in \nthe institutions, processes, and capabilities relating to PFM.  \n \n7.  Public  financial  management  and  rural  development. Reducing poverty requires \nappropriate policies and institutions, including the identification of poverty-reducing spending in \nthe budget. At the same time, links with PFM\u2014as a major crosscutting agenda\u2014need to be \nstrengthened.  Sustaining  rapid  economic  growth  over  the  long  term  will  require  economic \ndiversification and closer links between the agriculture and service sectors. These include (i) \nreforms in agriculture; (ii) increases in public capital spending; and (iii) PFM reforms. Therefore, \nthe institutional framework supporting rural development requires sustained support in PFM \nmechanisms. In an effort to establish an effective and efficient PFM system, the government \ninstituted the multistage Public Financial Management Reform Program (PFMRP). The initial \nactivities targeted strengthening budget credibility, including budget comprehensiveness, and \naggregate realism, the budget cycle, cash management and predictability of cash releases \n(platform  1).  Later  platforms  are  intended  to  address  financial  accountability,  policy  based \nbudgeting and accountability for performance.5 With a 10-year planning and implementation \nhorizon, the PFMRP is being supported through a sector-wide approach with financing from a \nnumber  of  development  partners,  primarily  through  a  multi-donor  trust  fund.  In  the  three \nprogram ministries, it will be important to build commensurate capacity by prioritizing the rollout \nof the training program and other measures designed under the PFMRP.  \n                                                 \n4  Government of Cambodia, 2008.

See  Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Public  Sector  Management \n(Appendix 2). ", "  3 \n8.  Public financial management to support good governance. ADB's support for the \nPFMRP in rural development is consistent with the priorities of the country strategy and program \nfor Cambodia and ADB's Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan, which has PFM \nand  procurement  as  central  themes  for  improving  governance.6 In  addition,  to  maximize \nharmonization and government ownership, and to minimize transaction costs, ADB and other \ndevelopment partners are using a sector-wide approach to support PFM. This approach is \ninformed by key lessons from implementing complex PFM reforms in a capacity-constrained \nenvironment that requires the gradual introduction of PFM changes. Progress will require long \ntime frames for external assistance given the weak starting points.  \n \n9.  Synergy  and  close  coordination  are  required  between  crosscutting  public  sector \nmanagement reform initiatives, such as the PFMRP (financial management), decentralization \nand  deconcentration  reforms  (restructuring  of  sub-national  administrations),  and  public \nadministrative  reforms  (personnel  management).  Public  administration  reforms,  including \nattractive pay and other incentives for civil servants, have a strong link with PFM that entails \nprobity and higher-level commitments. These reforms could help Cambodia provide significantly \nbetter, more cost-effective and more citizen-responsive public services and programs. The \nPFMRDP  is  adopting  a  phased  approach,  and  provides  the  groundwork  for  future \ndecentralization and deconcentration programs in Cambodia.7 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of subprogram 2 will be to strengthened prioritization of resource use and \nimproved governance. The outcome of subprogram 2 will be improved PFM subsystems in \nthree rural development ministries, which will be achieved through a set of program outputs.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n11.  Link between subprograms 1 and 2. The PFMRDP, approved by the Board as a \nprogram  cluster  on  4  December  2008,  comprises  two  single-tranche  subprograms  for \nimplementation  from  June  2006  to  December  2010  within  a  well-defined,  medium-term \nframework. 8  Subprogram 1 comprised (i) a grant of $6.71 million and (ii) a grant of $4.10 \nmillion to support institutional and capacity development. Subprogram 2 will continue the PFM \nreforms initiated under subprogram 1, and has 11 key reform actions to achieve three broad \nobjectives over the medium term that are intended to strengthen (i) the financial management \nframework to increase accountability, (ii) financial management in the rural priority sectors to \nimprove the delivery of services, and (iii) external audit as a pillar of accountability. Subprogram \n2 also will support the capacity development needs of the program ministries in the areas of \nPFM subsystems, and assist the NAA with implementation of key public policy audit reforms \nunder subprogram 2. The updated matrix reflects the policy actions the government has already \naccomplished (Appendix 4). The design and monitoring framework with relevant updates is in \nAppendix 1. The sector assessment (summary) is in Appendix 2. \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2007. Country Strategy and Program: Cambodia, 2005\u20132009. Manila; and ADB. 2010.

Progress in the implementation of policy actions under subprogram 2 is in Appendix 4. \nThis is to be read with Sector Assessment Summary in Appendix 2 and paras. 35\u201348 of the \nRRP for subprogram 1 (see Footnote 7). \n \n1.  Pillar  1:  Strengthening  Financial  Management  Framework  to  Increase \nAccountability \n \n13.  The government has sustained the momentum in PFM reforms since December 2008. \nIndependent evaluations undertaken in 2007 and 2010, including a Public Expenditure Financial \nAccountability Assessment (PEFA) suggest that the PFM reform program has contributed to \nachieving improved budget credibility, in what is a very challenging post-conflict environment \nwith substantive institutional and capacity constraints.9/10 Greater revenue collection and an \nefficient macro-fiscal and revenue forecasting has contributed to the overall credibility of the \nbudget through more timely and predictable release of funds. Budget comprehensiveness has \nalso improved with the introduction of medium-term budget strategy plans for all line ministries. \nGood expenditure control measures are in place. These measures resulted in aggregate fiscal \ndiscipline that supported the government's fiscal management in 2008 and 2009 in response to \nthe global financial crisis.  \n \n14.  Stage 2 includes a full rollout of the PFMRP to all line ministries and institutions. The \nMinistry of Economy and Finance (MEF) has strengthened efforts to finalize the ministerial \naction plans to ensure that all line ministries have a clear perspective of targeted outputs. The \nMEF recently established the PFM coordination working group for MRD, MAFF, and MOWRAM. \nThis group provides a platform for continuing dialogue on sector issues, including efficient public \nexpenditure management. Following the PFMRP annual retreat in January 2010, the MEF \nidentified  key  impediments,  and  proposed  finalizing  a  set  of  activities  to  accelerate \nimplementation of stage 2 of the PFMRP. \n \n15.  Several positive developments have strengthened budget execution and reporting. The \nDepartment  of  Public  Procurement  supported  the  line  ministries  in  the  preparation  of \nprocurement plans and organized training courses for procurement staff in 2009. Stronger cash \nmanagement, the creation of the Treasury single account, and the use of the banking system for \ntransactions have improved budget execution. The proposed financial management information \nsystem will further strengthen reporting and transaction processing efficiency under the PFMRP.  \n \n16.  Challenges  remain  in  finalizing  the  draft  procurement  law.11 The  first  draft  of  the \nframework for the sovereign procurement law of Cambodia is expected to be reviewed and \nfinalized  in  2010.  When  enacted  into  law,  it  will  merge  the  two  existing  procurement \nsystems\u2014one for state-budget financed procurement, the other for procurement financed by \ndevelopment partners. In the interim, the government has updated the Implementing Rules \nand Regulations for Public Procurement, 1998 (IRRPP), which was issued as supplementary \nrules and regulations under the Sub-Decree on Public Procurement, 1995. \n                                                 \n9 Government of Cambodia. 2007 and 2009.

", "  5 \n17.  Civil service pay initiatives, as part of broader national public administration reforms, \nhave gained momentum. Average salaries have quadrupled since 2004 to almost $90 per \nmonth in 2010. The Council for Administrative Reforms (CAR) has initiated consultations with a \nwide range of stakeholders to finalize the National Public Administration Reforms, 2009\u20132013 \nand  to  reform  the  whole  compensation  system  to  achieve  long\u2013term  sustainability  while \nmaintaining fiscal prudence. Several initiatives are being adopted: a labor market survey, an \noperational review, a census to map skills and expectations, introduction of new identification \ncards to foster organizational efficiency, and ensure that civil servants uphold the four core \nvalues of motivation, loyalty, professionalism, and service orientation. In order to further improve \nthe quality of service delivery, a new scheme -Priority Operating Costs (POCs)\u2013has been \nintroduced to provide a standardized incentive payment for selected civil servants.12  \n \n18.  The  government  has  continued  to  strengthen  the  institutional  capacity  for  debt \nmanagement through training and capacity development. A draft public debt sub-decree, which \nwill include provisions for debt and risk management, government on-lending, and government \nguarantees, is under consideration. The government is also finalizing a public debt management \nstrategy, which will help ensure that its borrowing needs are met efficiently.   \n \n2.  Pillar 2: Strengthening Financial Management in Rural Priority Sectors to \nImprove Service Delivery to Rural Population \n \n19.  The  program  ministries  have  continued  to  demonstrate  strong  ownership  of  the \ngovernment-led PFMRP. The establishment of the PFM reforms working group in MRD, MAFF, \nand MOWRAM has improved the institutional framework. Ministerial action plans for the PFMRP \nhave been prepared and are being implemented. The government-wide capacity development \nundertaken by the Economic and Finance Institute has improved PFM capacity through short- \nand long-term training, including that provided under the PFMRDP in the rural development \nministries. In 2009, the institute trained 64 staff from the three rural development ministries. This \nwas complemented by  a comprehensive PFM training plan with ADB support focusing on \nbudget planning, accounting, procurement, and internal audit. In the program ministries, the \nbudget formulation process has improved with the adoption of strategic budget frameworks, a \nkey tool for preparing their medium-term and annual expenditure plans. The draft 2010 budget \nis the first to include allocations to the program ministries for domestically funded investment \nexpenditures. In previous years, these ministries had received the bulk of the domestically \nfunded investment after it appeared in the budget as a line item. The MAFF and MRD have also \nbeen involved as pilot ministries in the introduction of program budgets since 2007, which aim to \nimprove the relevance of public spending by aligning resources more closely with policy priority \nareas.  \n \n20.  Budget  execution,  including  procurement  planning  and  practices,  has  continued  to \nimprove and are within \u00b15% of Budget Law allocations, drawing on PEFA best practice. The \nMRD, MAFF, and MOWRAM have continued to report to the MEF regular progress under \ndeconcentrated procurement procedures. Rural development ministries have improved in their \nuse  of  and  compliance  with  the  government's  standard  operating  procedure,  financial \nmanagement manual, and procurement manual for externally aided projects, as well as in their \n                                                 \n12 Priority operating costs (POCs) is an interim scheme defined as the costs of operating inputs necessary to achieve \nagreed outputs or results within the context of development programs, projects or activities. POCs payments are \nnot compensation or salary supplements.  \n ", "6   \nadherence to the good governance framework.13 Compliance is monitored through the annual \njoint country portfolio performance review by the MEF, ADB, and the World Bank. Internal audit \noversight in the program ministries has continued to make progress. A strategic audit plan for \n2010\u20132012 has been prepared, and an internal audit manual is being produced.  \n    \n3.  Pillar 3: Strengthening External Audit as Pillar of Public Accountability  \n \n21.  The NAA established in 2002 following the enactment of the Audit Law, 2000, continues \nto be strengthened. The number of audits performed by NAA has increased from 2 in 2002 to 58 \nin 2008 and 83 in 2009. However, the NAA needs to accelerate capacity development to be in a \nposition to extend audit coverage to 2,700 auditable entities within its jurisdiction. The NAA \npublished its first public audit report in 2009. An international audit peer review of the NAA by \nthe New Zealand Office of the Auditor General addressed the institutional constraints and \nestablished a baseline for a road map for long-term capacity development.  \n \nD.  Program Costs and Financing \n22.  The size of the program is based on considerations of a number of factors required to \nsupport implementation of reforms supported by the Program. This was determined by (i) the \nrelative importance of the reform program, the weight of the sector and the benefits from the \nreform program; (ii) the leverage necessary to counter  resistance from interest groups opposed \nto  transparency  enhancing  reforms    and  (iii)  the  policy  adjustment  costs  incurred  by  the \nGovernment and other stakeholders in implementing and complying with the reforms and (iv) \nthe  need  to  conform  with  the  overall  financing  requirement  from  the  Country  Partnership \nStrategy period.  ADB staff estimate that the long run benefits of the reform program are \napproximately $180 million - or about 1.5 % of GDP - from savings in the national government \nbudget from increased competition and transparency in procurement systems, savings from \nimproved budget execution and internal control systems and better public debt management, \nand from the second round effects of more efficient delivery of public goods and services.14 The \npolicy adjustment cost, arising from administrative, enforcement, and compliance costs, to the \ngovernment is estimated to be about $16 million in aggregate over the program implementation \nperiod. This includes (i) administrative cost to implement the PFMRP; (ii) investment cost to set \nup Integrated Financial management Information System; (iii) administrative cost to comply with \nthe internal audit and procurement procedures; and (iv) administrative cost to implement the \npeer-review recommendation of the NAA. To support the government reform initiatives outlined \nin  the  Program,  the  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  an  amount  not  exceeding  the \nequivalent of $10 million and a grant of $10 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help \nfinance subprogram 2. The loan will have a 24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years. \nThe annual interest rate will be 1% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. The program \nfinancing will be subject to such other terms and conditions substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft grant and loan agreements. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n23.  Program oversight and management. Implementation arrangements established \n                                                 \n13 All ADB-financed program and projects for Cambodia include a good governance framework. The framework \nincludes fiduciary risk mitigation measures that the government needs to implement related to (i) procurement \n(identification of procurement hotspots where risks occur, and mitigation measures); (ii) fiduciary management; (iii) \ncomplaint and remedy mechanisms; (iv) code of ethical conduct; and (v) sanctions.  \n14 See para 10-12 of the Subsector Analysis: The Public Financial Management Reform Program and Rural \nDevelopment Ministries ", "  7 \nunder subprogram 1 will continue. As the executing agency, the MEF will be responsible for \noverall  implementation  of  pillars  1  and  2  of  subprogram  2,  as  well  as  the  post-program \npartnership framework (PPPF), including program administration, disbursements, maintenance \nof all program records, and reporting to ADB. Key implementing agencies are the MRD, MAFF, \nMOWRAM, and CAR. The PFMRP steering committee, chaired by the MEF secretary of state \nand including the director general or secretary general in charge of finance from all ministries, \nwill  continue  as  the  program  steering  committee  responsible  for  coordinating  program \nimplementation. It will be supported by the Reform Committee Secretariat and the PFM reform \nworking groups at all program ministries for subprogram 2 implementation. The NAA is the \nexecuting agency for pillar 3, and will also responsible for relevant action under the PPPF.  \n \n24.  Procurement and disbursement arrangements. Implementation of Subprogram 2 is \nfrom January 2009 to 31 December 2010. The program loan and grant will be released in a \nsingle tranche upon completion of all the tranche conditions, and following loan and grant \neffectiveness. The closing date of the loan and grant will be 31 April 2011. The government will \nprimarily use the local currency counterpart funds generated by the grant and loan proceeds to \nmeet program expenditures and associated costs of reform. The proceeds of the program loan \nand  grant  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB's  Simplification  of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.15 Before withdrawing \nany funds, the government will open or nominate deposit accounts with the National Bank of \nCambodia to receive the loan and grant proceeds. The accounts will be managed, operated, \nand liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB. Subprogram 2 will provide for \nretroactive financing for eligible expenditures incurred by the government up to 180 days before \ngrant effectiveness. ADB will retain the right to audit the use of the grant and loan proceeds, and \nto verify the accuracy of the government\u2019s certification for the withdrawal application.  \n \n25.  Post-program partnership framework. Given the strategic reorientation in stage 2 of \nthe PFMRP and the long-term nature of some of the critical reforms such as decentralization \nand deconcentration and public administration reforms, the government agreed to establish a \nPPPF for 2 years. This will allow continual policy dialogue and engagement during 2011\u20132012. \nIncorporated in the revised policy matrix (Appendix 4), the PPPF focuses on the government's \npriorities. In coordination with the program steering committee, ADB will carry out periodic \nreviews of the implementation progress of the PPPF and assess the impact of the PFMRDP.  \n \nIII.  GRANT ASSISTANCE FOR CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT \n \n26.  In response to the government\u2019s request to design a second phase of the existing \nproject, a separate grant project for capacity development has been formulated. Given the \nvarying pace and unevenness of PFM progress in the program ministries, implementation of \nPFM reforms under the PFMRP will require additional technical inputs and targeted on-the-job \nsupport. The knowledge and skills will ensure that the policy and institutional reforms will be \nsustained  beyond  the  PFMRDP  and  that  objectives  under  the  PFMRP  are  achieved.  The \nproposed capacity development project will have four outputs. The first will continue to support \nthe three rural development ministries in PFM subsystems, including internal audit, monitoring, \nand evaluation. The second will support the MEF (Department of Investment and Cooperation) \nin public debt management issues. The third output will support two activities of the CAR within \nthe scope of NPAR 2009\u20132013. The fourth output will support the NAA in strengthening audit \ncapacity in selected areas.  The project is estimated to cost $5.5 million. ADB will finance $5 \nmillion from its Special Funds Resources (Asian Development Fund), including applicable taxes, \n                                                 \n15  ADB. 1998.

The project will be implemented from January 2011 to March 2013. At the request and \non behalf of the government, ADB will engage the consultants and administer their contracts in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime) and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. This continues the arrangement established \nfor subprogram 1, approved in December 2008. The ADB administration of the project is to \novercome  the  governance  and  inter-ministerial  coordination  problems,  and  to  ensure  that \nproject activities are synchronized across a wide range of agencies.

DUE DILIGENCE \n28.  Economic and financial. The program will produce economic gains through efficient \nresource use. It will have no fiscal impact since its main thrust is to build capacity in the three \nrural development ministries.  \n \n29.  Governance. The design of the PFMRDP is anchored in the governance framework. \nThe government is committed to key governance reforms in the PFMRP, and good progress \nhas  been  made.  The  enactment  of  the  Anticorruption  Law  in  March  2010  and  the \nimplementation of broader public administration reforms that incentivize civil service will improve \npublic sector governance and strengthen the accountability framework. ADB's Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the MEF, CAR, NAA, \nMRD, MAFF, and MOWRAM. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in paragraph 80 of the PAM (footnote 18). \n \n30.  Poverty and social impact.  The PFMRDP, a general intervention aimed at supporting \nsustainable  economic  growth,  is  expected  to  have  an  indirect  positive  effect  on  poverty \nreduction. The program will improve the delivery of services in rural areas where the poor are \nconcentrated, and where women comprise the majority of the workforce (73.5% of agricultural \nworkers). Details are in the summary poverty reduction and social strategy.17 \n \n31.  Safeguards. PFMRDP Subprogram 2 does not trigger the safeguard policies and is \ncategorized as C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous people.   \n \n32.  Risks  and  mitigating  measures.  Subprogram  2  of  the  PFMRDP  assumes \nmacroeconomic  and  political  stability  in  Cambodia  over  the  medium  term.  However, \nimplementation of subprogram 2 could face a number of risks for which mitigation measures \n                                                 \n17 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (Appendix 2). \n ", "10   \nhave been put in place.

In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: (i) keep ADB informed of policy \ndiscussions with other stakeholders about measures to ensure effective implementation of the \nPFMRDP, (ii) give ADB the opportunity to comment on relevant studies and draft laws or \ndecrees that are likely to affect PFMRDP objectives and implementation, and (iii) implement in a \ntimely manner the polices and reform actions indicated in the PPPF.  \n   \nVI.
