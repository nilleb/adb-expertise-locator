THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach, (ii) a proposed policy-based loan for subprogram 1, and (iii) a proposed \nproject loan, all to Georgia for the Modern Skills for Better Jobs Sector Development Program. \nThe program supports the Government of Georgia\u2019s efforts to improve the quality and relevance \nof, and access to, vocational education and training (VET) in Georgia. Two key areas of focus will \nbe to increase the participation of women in nontraditional fields of VET and in the labor market, \nand encourage stronger involvement of the private sector in VET. \n \nII.  THE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n2.  Economic context. Georgia enjoyed a 4.7% average annual rate of gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) growth and kept its annual fiscal deficit equal to about 1.0% of GDP during \n2011\u22122019.1 It halved its poverty rate from 38.8% in 2007 to 20.1% in 2018. GDP grew by 5.1% \nin 2019 but is expected to fall by 5.0% in 2020 because of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).2  \nIt is also estimated that, because of COVID-19, the unemployment rate could increase from 11.6% \nin 2019 to 31.5% in 2020. Restrictions on economic activity across almost all industries3 put many \npeople at risk, either by downward adjustments to income or working hours, or by losing their jobs. \nA preliminary estimate suggests that, in 2020, roughly 385,000 people or about 23.4% of the \nemployed face a high risk of job displacement.4 As a response to the sharp increase in the fiscal \ndeficit in 2020, the authorities adopted a medium-term plan to gradually bring the fiscal deficit to \n3% by 2023.5 The ratio of public debt to GDP stood at 44.5% in 2019. The International Monetary \nFund (IMF) assessed public debt as remaining at sustainable levels over the medium term.6 \n \n3.  Labor market context. The population has declined considerably since 1990 and is \nexpected to continue doing so because of low birth rates and continued net emigration, the latter \nbecause of a lack of well-paying jobs in the country. For now, employment in low-productivity \nagriculture remains relatively high.7 Agriculture accounts for almost half of employment but \ncontributes less than 10% to GDP. Most labor resources are locked in low-productivity jobs that \nrequire low-level skills. Future economic growth supported by technological advancement and \nglobal market demands will therefore require (i) efforts to improve the skills of the workforce to \nincrease productivity and employment, and (ii) measures to boost growth in emerging and high-\ndemand industries. And while the overall unemployment rate has fallen considerably\u2014from \n17.2% in 2012 to 11.6% in 2019\u2014thanks to improvements in the country\u2019s business environment, \nyouth unemployment is at 30.4%,8 and the share of 15\u201329-year-olds who are not in employment, \n \n1  International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Sector context. VET is part of the education sector11 and comprises basic, secondary, \nand  higher  vocational  education;  associate  degree  programs;  and  short-term  training  and \nretraining courses. Students generally enter VET after grade 9 or grade 12. Most are enrolled in \nformal, institute-based VET programs at lower levels of the national qualifications framework \n(NQF). VET provision also includes government-sponsored training and retraining for adults. In \n2019, some 90 VET institutes delivered formal programs to more than 11,850 enrollees.12 VET \nenrollments  have  fallen  by  27.0%  since  2017,  because  of  the  introduction  of  longer-term \ncompetency-based training and assessment (CBTA) programs. Private VET institutes play an \nimportant role in Georgia, representing almost 60.0% of all VET providers, although only 33.9% \nof total VET enrollments. They are largely funded by tuition fees and are concentrated in Tbilisi \nand other urban centers where people can afford to pay the tuition fees. Since 2019, however, \nthey have been receiving government funding for students enrolled in programs covering priority \nfields.  \n \n5.  In public VET institutes, almost one-third of students are enrolled in engineering (36%), \nfollowed by business administration (14%), services (13%), and information and communication \ntechnology  (10%).  In  private  VET  institutes,  39%  are  enrolled  in  health-related  programs \n(including pharmaceuticals), followed by business administration (17%) and engineering (11%). \nThe gender distribution of enrollments reflects the program offerings of public and private VET \ninstitutes. In 2019, 62% of private enrollees were women, while only 41% of public enrollees were \nwomen. In 2019, VET institutes cumulatively employed about 5,300 teachers, 72% of them \nwomen. Female teachers have higher qualifications than male ones (footnote 10). \n \n6.  VET is largely publicly funded. During 2017\u22122020, state spending on VET increased from \nGEL37.8 million to GEL66.5 million, in line with the government\u2019s intention to boost spending on \neducation from 3.8% to 6.0% of GDP by 2022.13 VET spending increased across all categories: \nvoucher programs, institutional and targeted programs, training and retraining programs, and \ncapital investment. State spending on VET represents 4.9% of the government\u2019s education \nbudget,14 less than half the share of the higher education sector. VET applicants who meet the \nentrance requirements get their full tuition covered at public VET institutes, and in priority study \nfields at private institutions. \n \n7.  Challenges in skills development. In 2018, the government adopted a new Law on \nVocational Education15 that revised the NQF, strengthened VET quality assurance, and expanded \nthe network of public VET providers, including through  public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs). \nDespite these efforts, the VET system still falls short in three areas: (i) quality and relevance of \nVET; (ii) access to, and participation in, VET; and (iii) policy and institutional framework for VET. \nThe lack of market-relevant skills affects both workers and employers by constraining earnings \n \n9  Government of Georgia, National Statistics Office. 2020.

Quality and relevance of training. The quality and relevance of VET programs are key \nconcerns. Although Georgia ranked 46th on the skills pillar of the Global Competitiveness Index \n2019, it fared poorly on key training components such as (i) extent of staff training, (ii) quality of \nVET, (iii) skills set of graduates, and (iv) ease of finding skilled employees.17 An inadequately \neducated workforce is also identified as one of the top five obstacles for innovators in Georgia by \nthe Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey.18 In addition, one in five firms \nsees the lack of workers with solid digital skills as a major or severe problem that constrains their \ngrowth (footnote 7). In addition, although the employment rate for VET graduates rose by \n4 percentage points during 2015\u22122017, a 2017 tracer study showed that the employment rate in \n2017 was about 58%\u201364% for men and 55% for women.19 While some institutes perform well, \nquality is variable. The measured unemployment rate for those with a VET education was 11.1% \nin 2018, slightly below that of higher education graduates (12.9%). \n \n9.  A mismatch exists between the skills required in the labor market and those produced by \nthe VET system. The Skills Towards Employability and Productivity survey by the World Bank \nhighlighted the lack of adequate problem-solving and technical skills in employees. It also showed \nthat employers were dissatisfied with the supply of skilled workers and found it difficult to hire \nworkers with the skills they needed. The biggest demand was for middle-skilled workers rather \nthan  high-skilled  workers  (footnote  7).  Beyond  the  educational  background,  employers  are \nprimarily looking for job-related skills, followed by positive personality traits. They generally \nbelieve that the educational system is not responding to the labor market needs.20  While firms \nneed workers with low- and mid-level technical skills, the education system produces mostly \ngraduates with higher education qualifications and graduates lacking soft and generic skills.21 \n \n10.  The ability to deliver high-quality training is hindered by such factors as poor quality of the \nteaching workforce, as well as outdated facilities that are often not adequate for emerging skills \nareas. Low teacher salaries and the lack of teachers\u2019 professional development hamper the ability \nto attract and retain high-quality teachers. Part-time work among teachers is common.22 \n \n11.  Limited access and participation. A second key concern is the low VET participation \nrate\u2014enrollments total less than 3% of young people aged 15\u201324, or only about 10% of the \nparticipation rate in higher education. A main reason is that higher education is seen as superior \nto VET for acquiring skills. Annual admissions to VET have declined since 2017 because of a \nfundamental change in the training approach\u2014transition from general training to CBTA\u2014and an \nincrease in program duration from 6\u201312 months to an average 18 months. The small size of the \nTVE system limits the impact it can have on individuals\u2019 economic opportunities, on firms\u2019 access \nto skilled labor, and on the economy more generally. Substantial gender segregation is visible in \nprogram choices and the labor market (footnote 8). Men tend to work in better-paying traditional \n \n16 World Bank. 2015.

Access to VET is limited by several factors. The unified admission examination required \nfor entering government-funded VET institutes creates an academic barrier to weaker students \nwho often come from poorer backgrounds. 24 This is exacerbated by the large presence of private \nVET institutes (para. 4), which are not affordable for many (footnote 22). Moreover, the network \nof VET providers spans only 37 of 69 municipalities, and is largely concentrated in the capital, \nTbilisi.25 The small size of the system limits its ability to have a positive impact on individuals\u2019 \neconomic opportunities, and the country\u2019s ability to diversify its economy. \n \n13.  Policy  and  institutional  framework.  A  core  weakness  of  the  current  policy  and \ninstitutional framework is the limited engagement of the private sector in the development and \nplanning of VET, especially in developing occupational standards which is the basis for VET \ncurriculum. Private input was possible through the vocational education committees with employer \nrepresentation that were created under the National Center for Education Quality Enhancement \nin 2014 to develop occupational standards and VET curricula. These committees operated until \n2017 but are no longer functional. The new VET law (footnote 15) envisages the creation of \nprivately  led  sector  skills  organizations  (SSOs)  to  drive  the  development  of  occupational \nstandards. The 2018 law on PPP26 established a framework to institutionalize  cooperation \nbetween VET institutes and the industry, but the use of PPPs remains limited. Because of a \nfunding framework that favors public VET institutes, the capacity of private colleges is underused. \nPoor students cannot afford the tuition and other fees, so private VET institutes are generally only \nfound in urban centers. \n \n14.  Strategic  alignment.  The  program  is  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s  key  economic \nstrategies: (i) Georgia 2020,27 the country\u2019s overarching socioeconomic strategy, which names \nskills enhancement as a key socioeconomic development goal; (ii) the Government Programme \n2019\u22122020,28 which lists education and economic growth as priority reform areas; and (iii) the \nRegional Development Programme of Georgia 2018\u22122021, which prioritizes human resources.29 \nThe country partnership strategy, 2019\u20132023 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for Georgia \nincludes the development of human resources through support for education.30 The proposed \nprogram is listed in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2020\u22122022.31 It supports three of \nADB\u2019s seven operational priorities under its Strategy 2030: (i) reducing poverty and inequalities, \n(ii) accelerating progress in gender equality, and (iii) strengthening governance and institutional \ncapacity.32 The proposed program will also complement the planned Sustainable Water Supply \n \n23 ADB. 2018.

It is similar to entrance examination of general schools.  A student who is good at practical skills \nand/or good at certain subjects might fail the examination, because of his/her poor marks on overall academic \nsubjects. Discussion on examination reforms are on-going to develop tailor-made entrance examinations by the VET \ninstitutes.  \n25 46 out of the 52 private institutes are located in the 3 big cities: Tbilisi, Kutaisi and Batumi.   \n26 Government of Georgia. 2018.

Modality.  ADB  and  the  government  selected  the  sector  development  program\u2014\nconsisting of a policy-based component and an investment component\u2014because of the parallel \nneeds for development financing, policy reforms, and project financing to meet infrastructure, \nequipment, and capacity requirements. The modality is appropriate because (i) the government \nhas increased its emphasis on human capital development since 2017 and shows strong will for \nVET reforms; (ii) the program's holistic and integrated approach translates into balanced policy \nreform and much-needed investment in VET; (iii) the modality strengthens sustainability outcomes \nby removing structural barriers to VET development; and (iv) it provides a strong tool to ensure \nthat  the  planned  increase  in  education  spending  yields  better  outcomes.  The  policy  and \ninvestment components are mutually reinforcing\u2014investments help operationalize reforms in the \nshort term, and policy reforms increase the long-term sustainability and effectiveness of project \noutputs. The policy-based lending component is in the form of a programmatic approach with two \nsubprograms that support the government\u2019s VET reform agenda. This approach is preferred \nbecause it will allow (i) the formulation and implementation of stronger reform initiatives, and \n(ii) adjustments to the proposed reforms should there be any changes in the government\u2019s VET \nstrategy. \n \nB.  Policy Reform Agenda and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n16.  Policy reform agenda. Georgia\u2019s VET system requires a significant improvement in its \nquality and relevance and a broadening of access. The program will support the government in \nremoving  critical  constraints  in  line  with  the  Unified  Strategy  for  Education  and  Science \n2017\u22122021,35 which commits the government to increasing the number of skilled graduates by \n(i) aligning VET with labor market needs, (ii) ensuring broader access to VET, and (iii) promoting \nVET as a skills development pathway. Subprogram 1 begins the task of introducing concrete \nreforms in line with the goals outlined in the Unified Strategy, such as implementing a revised \nNQF;  increasing  access  by  launching  a formal  system  of  adult training;  strengthening  the \ngovernance of VET institutes and the system as a whole; improving teaching; reinforcing quality \nassurance; stepping up spending on VET; boosting the engagement of the private sector in the \ndevelopment of occupational standards and work-based learning (WBL); introducing PPPs; and \nextending the government\u2019s voucher program to students enrolled in priority programs of private \nVET institutes. The second subprogram builds on the reforms of the first one in terms of teaching \nimprovements, private sector engagement, PPPs, and broader access. It also deepens reforms \nin areas such as the development of a gender policy. \n \n17.  Policy-based and project loan links. The policy reforms will sustain the government\u2019s \nVET reform agenda, complement investments under the project loan, and generate sustainable \nimprovements  in  the  performance  of  the  VET  system.  They  will  help  assure  that  project \ninvestments translate into more effective VET, and labor market and economic outcomes. Project \ninvestments are essential to support the implementation of the reform initiatives and are used for \npurchasing equipment and for strengthening operation and maintenance capacity, all of which will \ncontribute to greater operational efficiency of the VET system in Georgia. Policy measures such \nas greater private involvement in VET through SSOs and PPPs, an increase in VET budgets, \n \n33 ADB. 2020.

Subprograms 1 and 2 and post-program partnership framework. Subprogram 1 \ncovers several major reform areas, including revision and improvements of the NQF, quality \nassurance, adult education, and private sector involvement. It also includes the piloting of PPPs, \nas well as two actions related to fiscal issues\u2014increase in teacher salaries and more spending \non VET. Subprogram 1 also helps formulate the concept for the governance of skills hubs, which \nis needed to implement skills hubs under reform area 1. Subprogram 2 covers most of the same \nissues. It (i) extends these policy actions in some cases including  PPPs; (ii) formalizes approvals \nof  concepts  or  intermediate  decisions  in  other  policy  areas  (e.g.,  skills  hubs,  WBL,  and \noccupational standards); (iii) introduces new reforms (e.g., VET gender policy, VET system \ngovernance); and (iv) implements policies approved under subprogram 1 (e.g., NQF). A post-\nprogram partnership framework (P3F) will be implemented during 2022\u22122026 to provide an \navenue for future engagement with the government, ADB, and other development partners on \nkey policy reform issues. Some policy actions in subprogram 1 are fundamental administrative \nprocesses and will translate into changes in practices under subprogram 2 and during the P3F \nperiod. They ultimately lead to improved performance and outcomes of the VET system, and \neventually bring changes in the classrooms and beyond. The selected method drives substantial \nprogress throughout the programmatic approach and helps smooth the implementation of the \nP3F.36 \n \n19.  ADB\u2019s value addition. The program represents ADB\u2019s first engagement in the education \nsector in Georgia. Its design was informed by ADB\u2019s extensive experience in VET across Asia, in \nsuch diverse countries as India, Indonesia, the Kyrgyz Republic, the People\u2019s Republic of China, \nand Viet Nam.37 Two overarching lessons derived from it are the need for political and financial \ncommitment to raising the quality of VET, and the importance of private sector involvement, not \nleast in planning, financing, and curriculum development. Other lessons from previous ADB \nprojects and broader VET experience are the importance of (i) mobilizing students to pursue VET; \n(ii) incorporating entrepreneurship into programs; (iii) recruiting and training qualified teachers; \n(iv) providing career guidance and good labor market data to improve decision-making; (v) taking \nmeasures to increase women\u2019s participation; (vi) combining in-class training and WBL; (vii) \nimparting  soft  skills;  and  (viii)  using  recognized  quality  standards,  testing,  and certification \nprocesses. The program incorporates these lessons through both its program actions and project \ninitiatives. \n \n20.  Development coordination. The largest development partner for Georgia's VET efforts \nis the European Union, which has supported the system since 2008, followed by Germany's \nGesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), the United Kingdom\u2019s Good Governance \nFund, the United Nations Development Programme, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, and \n \n36 A policy reform working group, headed by MOESCS and with development partners as members, will refine the \npolicy actions for subprogram 2 and continue as the focal point for the development and implementation of the P3F. \n37 ADB. 2009.

German development cooperation \nthrough KfW is developing a center of excellence in construction and logistics in Tbilisi. Two \ndevelopment partner coordination groups operate under the Ministry of Education, Science, \nCulture and Sport (MOESCS)\u2014one covering all levels of education, one covering VET.38 These \nprovide an avenue for ADB to work with the IMF and other partners to further elaborate VET \nobjectives. The government is committed to reforms under the IMF\u2019s Extended Financing Facility \nto support the country\u2019s long-term economic performance. The IMF will supervise the compliance \nwith  performance  criteria  and  structural  benchmarks  that  help  sustain  the  medium-term \nmacroeconomic stability. ADB and the IMF have continuously liaised during the program design. \nADB also collaborated with the IMF in 2018 in preparing a document on Georgia\u2019s labor market \nand education system that set out the challenges facing the education and training system and \npossible directions for reform (footnote 7). \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n \n21.  The program is aligned with the following impact: inclusive economic growth strengthened \n(footnote 27). The effect of the reform is: a responsive VET network promoting excellence in skills \ndevelopment strengthened. The proposed program reform areas are: (i) quality and relevance of \nVET in priority economic sectors improved; (ii) access to, and inclusiveness of, the VET system \nincreased; and (iii) institutional framework strengthened through increased private participation in \nVET.39 (All policy actions for subprogram 1 have been completed). The program's policy-based \nand investment components cover all reform areas. The impact of the project will be: labor \nproductivity and competitiveness of the economy enhanced; its outcome will be: VET institutions \nand program aligned with evolving labor market needs. \n \n22.  Reform area 1: Quality and relevance of VET in priority economic sectors improved. \nThe reforms under this area will improve the quality and relevance of VET through better programs \nand diversification of revenues. Subprogram 1 policy actions include (i) development of a concept \nfor the governance framework for skills hubs, which aims at strengthening links with international \neducation and industry partners in adopting corporate principles to improve responsiveness and \ninstitutional efficiency; (ii) augmented voucher program, to include a 30% rise in remuneration for \nVET teachers to recruit and retain qualified teachers; (iii) increase in VET budget by about 23% \nstarting from January 2020;40 (iv) approval of a revised NQF; and (v) approval of VET authorization \nstandards and procedures. Subprogram 2 policy actions involve (i) approval of the governance \nframework for skills hubs (concept developed in subprogram 1); (ii) approval of a regulatory \nframework for VET teachers\u2019 competencies, induction, and in-service professional development; \n(iii) approval of revised entrepreneurship modules, as part of a national VET standard in line with \nthe European Entrepreneurship Competence Framework; and (iv) adoption of a regulation for a \nrevised VET funding framework, including the introduction of performance-based funding for VET \ninstitutes. \n \n23.  The project component will finance the establishment of two innovative skills hubs in \nexisting VET institutes in Kutaisi and Telavi to deliver high-quality and relevant training in seven \npriority economic sectors.41 The skills hubs will display sector leadership and innovation, develop \n \n38 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents under Appendix 2). \n39 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n40 The increase was to upscale the VET programs (all the budget components, including expansion of voucher program, \ninstitutional and targeted programs, and training programs). \n41 Priority economic sectors are (i) electronic engineering, (ii) information and communication technology, (iii) medical \nand pharmaceutical production, (iv) fashion and design, (v) water engineering, (vi) furniture production and carpentry, \nand (vii) services (hospitality and tourism). \n ", "8 \nnational and international links, and support other VET institutes. The program will finance \nimproved gender-sensitive facilities; updated equipment; training in entrepreneurship, languages, \nand soft skills; student placement services; capacity building; and support for income-generating \nactivities. The hub locations were chosen based on (i) their proximity to economic growth nodes, \n(ii) alignment of programs with priority economic sectors, (iii) government priorities, and (iv) the \ncondition of facilities and equipment. Skills hubs will have increased public and private funding. \nThe program will develop new or revise existing CBTA programs at NQF levels 4 and 5. The \nprogram steering committee will be able to propose changes to the prioritization of economic \nsectors and VET programs to reflect changes in economic circumstances or government priorities. \nThe project will also support the introduction of income-generating activities in skills hubs. \n \n24.  Reform area 2: Access to, and inclusiveness of, VET system increased. This reform \narea will increase access to VET and expand its scope to earlier levels of education. The \nsubprogram 1 policy actions involve approving (i) a new regulatory framework for adult education, \nincluding program development, eligibility to deliver programs, and rules for student enrollments; \n(ii) VET enrollment rules and procedures for youth and vulnerable groups supported by a more \nequitable funding scheme; and (iii) revised rules and procedures for the recognition of nonformal \nlearning. Subprogram 2 policy actions include (i) further expansion of VET delivery in secondary \nschools; and (ii) development of a VET gender equality policy, and guidelines and approval of a \n5-year action plan in 2022 to put this policy into effect. \n \n25.  The project component will support the introduction of VET in 20 secondary schools to \ndeliver CBTA VET programs at NQF levels 3 and 4 in priority economic sectors, by upgrading \nfacilities, providing equipment, supporting curriculum development, and building capacity. It will \nalso (i) formulate a VET gender policy and guidelines, (ii) undertake social marketing of VET, and \n(iii) establish a career guidance and counseling system. \n \n26.  Reform area 3: Institutional framework strengthened through increased private \nparticipation in VET. These reforms will strengthen the VET institutional framework by taking \nmeasures to increase private participation in the system. Subprogram 1 policy actions include \n(i) approval of MOESCS regulations on the transfer of responsibility for the development of \noccupational standards and the coordination of WBL with industry-led SSOs; (ii) piloting a VET \nPPP by authorizing collaboration with a private construction company and a privately operated \ncollege in Western Georgia, to offer VET programs in construction; and (iii) extended eligibility for \nthe government voucher program to private VET providers for some students enrolled in priority \nprograms. Subprogram 2 policy actions include (i) approval of a policy on occupational standards \nand  coordination  of  WBL  with  industry-led  SSOs;  (ii)  creation  of  a  skills  authority  with \n(a) responsibility for VET system governance, (b) a charter providing for private sector and \ngovernment participation in decision-making, and (c) 50% female representation on its board; (ii) \napproval of occupational standards  developed by SSOs  and (iii) approval of the PPP program \ndocuments for at least one additional VET PPP transaction (baseline: 3). \n \n27.  The project component will establish SSOs in seven priority economic sectors, responsible \nfor  the  development  of  occupational  standards  and  WBL  in  VET.  The  government  will  (i) \nencourage private participation in SSOs, (ii) finance specialized training in priority economic \nsectors, and (iii) pilot an innovative model of privately managed VET programs. \n \n28.  Response to COVID-19. The project design includes several measures to mitigate the \nimpact of COVID-19, such as boosting sectors and programs that are effective in responding to \na  pandemic  or  in  contributing  to  economic  recovery  (e.g.,  information  and  communication \ntechnology, and pharmaceutical and medical production). The project will finance the introduction \n ", "9 \nof e-learning and the retraining of workers in hard-hit sectors to help them acquire new skills and \nfind work in areas with increasing employment opportunities and higher value addition. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs, Summary Cost Estimates, and Financing Plan \n \n29.  The government has requested \u20ac67,865,600 in financial assistance in the form of a \nprogrammatic approach, comprising two regular policy-based loans from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources: \u20ac42,416,000 for subprogram 1 in 2020, and \u20ac25,449,600 for subprogram 2 in 2022 \n(indicative). The total financing gap for fiscal year 2020 is considerable at $1.613 billion, based \non a fiscal deficit of 8.5% of GDP in 2020 (footnote 6).42 Total budget support in 2020 is expected \nto be $1.782 billion, $169 million more than the financing gap.43 Total ADB budget support in 2020 \nwill tentatively be $530 million, or 32.9% of the total financing gap. The proposed budget support \nthrough subprogram 1 in 2020 will help bridge about 3.0% of the total financing gap. \n \n30.  The policy-based loan amount is justified by the government\u2019s development financing \nneeds. The loan for subprogram 1 will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; \nan annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the annuity repayment method with \n30% discount factor, the average maturity is 12.1 years, and no maturity premium is payable to \nADB. \n \n31.

ADB put together \na comprehensive package of support in response to the government\u2019s official request for assistance submitted on \n26 March 2020. ADB approved COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support ($100 million),  fiscal resilience \nand social protection ($200 million), and water supply and sanitation ($80 million), and is also preparing education \n($50 million), and policy-based loans for energy ($100 million), for an expected total disbursement of $530 million in \n2020 subject to approval. In addition, budget support from other development partners in 2020 totals $1,252 million: \n(i) $205 million from Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, (ii) $150 million from the Asian Infrastructure Investment \nBank, (iii) $223 million from the European Union, (iv) $294 million from German development cooperation through \nKfW, (v) $200 million from the IMF, and (vi) $180 million from the World Bank. \n43 The government sought budget support from development partners in excess of its expected financing needs. \nAlthough $1,782 million was discussed with development partners, only $1,157 million was signed by 24 August \n2020, of which only $615 million has been disbursed so far.

The government requested a regular loan of \u20ac16,966,400 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the project component. The project cost includes goods (equipment and \nfurniture), civil works, training, consulting services, project management, physical and price \ncontingencies, and interest during construction. It will have a 23-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 14 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year (interest and other charges during \nconstruction to be capitalized in the loan); and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \ndraft loan agreement. Based on the straight-line repayment method, the average maturity is 18.75 \nyears, and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.20% per annum. The government will \nfinance \u20ac7,634,880 in civil works, equipment and furniture, training, workshop, survey, and \ncurriculum  development;  and  in-kind  assistance  of  \u20ac5,938,240  in  the  form  of  office \naccommodation, office supplies, maintenance and repairs, environmental monitoring and social \ndue diligence reports; and taxes and duties.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n \n34.  The program will finance skills hubs and secondary schools offering VET. These will have \nimproved features compared with other VET providers, such as renovated classrooms and \nworkshops, updated equipment, and gender-inclusive design. Skills hubs will operate under new \ngovernance arrangements, such as greater management autonomy and accountability, which will \nensure the sustainable use of facilities and equipment. SSOs will strengthen the role of the private \nsector in VET. All facilities will meet or exceed national construction codes. \n \n ", "12 \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n35.  Reforms to education and enhanced sector management, including in VET, can help \nproduce a better-skilled workforce and support more robust and inclusive growth. Shifts in \nemployment from low productivity and/or low-wage sectors to high-productivity and/or high wage \nsectors can be a key driver of labor productivity growth and economic development (footnote 7). \nThe project will generate economic benefits from (i) increased enrollments, graduation, and \nemployment rates for long (1.5\u20133.0 years) and short (less than 1 year) VET courses in skills hubs \nand secondary schools; (ii) a small increase in graduation and employment rates for long and \nshort courses in conventional VET institutes; and (iii) a wage premium for employed graduates \nfrom skills hubs. More effective VET will lift the lifetime incomes of skills hub graduates, given the \nwage premium over those without VET.45 The economic internal rate of return is conservatively \ncalculated at 8.9% based on a discount rate of 6%.46 Increased women\u2019s employability will also \nbe the project\u2019s benefit. It is somewhat sensitive to changes in graduation and employment rates \nfor long courses in skills hubs and secondary schools, and to lower wage premiums. It is less \nsensitive to smaller increases in graduation and employment rates for short courses. The project \nremains economically viable under all these scenarios. It does not generate revenue so a financial \nviability analysis is not required. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n36.  Program sustainability is rated high. ADB and individual VET consultants will provide \ncapacity building and guidance to staff of MOESCS, Educational and Scientific Infrastructure \nDevelopment Agency, Municipal Development Fund, and the project implementation unit (PIU). \nThis will include training on ADB procurement regulations, disbursement procedures, financial \nmanagement, and safeguards monitoring and management. The  VET consultants will also \nprepare a sustainability strategy for the design and management of education infrastructure and \nequipment. The financial analysis concluded that the project\u2019s recurrent cost impact on state \nbudget expenditures will be very small and hence fully manageable from a fiscal perspective.47 \nThe government has assured ADB that it will make up for any shortfall in the finances required \nfor the project component. \n \nD.  Governance \n37.  Financial management and procurement risk assessments, and strategic procurement \nplanning were conducted. Key findings are in the risk assessment and risk management plan.48 \nThe assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk is substantial mainly because MOESCS \nstaff lack experience with ADB\u2019s financial management requirements and procedures. To address \nthis, the PIU will engage qualified financial management staff who will be trained in ADB\u2019s financial \nmanagement procedures and requirements. Other risks relate to accounting and internal control \n(lack of financial management or accounting guidelines), internal audit (formal internal audit \nqualifications of staff), and financial reporting (procedural issues in preparing the ministry-level \nconsolidated annual financial statements). \n \n38.  The  project  procurement  risk  is  moderate.  It  can  be  mitigated  by  (i)  engaging  a \nprocurement specialist in the PIU; (ii) customizing the national e-procurement system to meet the \nrequirements of ADB's procurement regulations; (iii) conducting roadshows for local construction \n \n45 I.

ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, \nas amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and MOESCS. The \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 44). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n39.  The program will increase the opportunities for skills development and thereby boost the \nemployability of VET graduates, lift their lifetime incomes, and reduce disparities. It integrates \ninclusive measures to enhance VET access for women, ethnic minorities, people with disabilities, \nand other vulnerable groups. Women have fewer opportunities than men in accessing educational \nprograms and employment in fields that are in high demand in the labor market (paras. 3 and 11). \nIn general, women earn 40% less than men.49 The program is categorized as gender equity theme, \nand includes gender-responsive design features such as (i) set-up of gender-inclusive skills hubs; \n(ii) training programs for women and vulnerable groups; (iii) CBTA-based VET programs that \nprioritize  women\u2019s  access  to  skills  development  in  high-demand  areas;  and  (iv)  expanded \nawareness-raising campaigns on VET and gender-sensitive career guidance programs.50 \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n40.  Environment (category B). MOESCS prepared a consolidated draft initial environmental \nexamination in line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The examination showed that \nthe construction and renovation of workshops, classrooms, and utilities under the program will \nhave site-specific temporary environmental impacts, including air and water pollution, noise, solid \nwaste, and occupational and community health and safety. A generic environmental management \nplan and its mitigation and monitoring programs will be part of the bidding documents for civil \nworks. \n \n41.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). Skills hubs and secondary schools will be \nestablished in existing compounds with available land. The renovation of existing buildings and \nthe construction of new facilities will take place on institute- or school-owned land, which is free \nof encumbrances. No third-party land users were identified, and project works will not adversely \naffect business or livelihood activities. In case of any changes in selected subproject sites or other \nchanges at the detailed design stage, a safeguards due diligence report was prepared and will be \nupdated to confirm the absence of land acquisition and resettlement impacts. \n \n42.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The program has been classified as category C for \nindigenous people\u2019s safeguard. There are no indigenous people\u2019s communities in the project area \nor in the country in general, as defined in the ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement for operational \npurposes.  Accordingly, no indigenous peoples planning documents are required. \nG.  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n43.
