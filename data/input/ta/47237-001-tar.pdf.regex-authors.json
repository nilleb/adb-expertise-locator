The  Government  of  Fiji  asked  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  capacity \ndevelopment technical assistance (TA) during a sector assessment mission to Fiji from 26 June \nto 4 July 2013.1 A TA fact-finding mission visited Fiji on 18\u201327 September 2013 and reached an \nunderstanding with the government and other stakeholders on the impact, outcome, outputs, \nimplementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference  for \nconsulting services. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Fiji has a population of about 868,000, of which 53% is urban.3 By 2030, it is estimated \nthat two in three Fijians will be living in the country\u2019s urban centers.4 Fiji\u2019s urban sector accounts \nfor 60% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product, with the share of the Greater Suva Area (GSA) \nestimated at 40%.5 The GSA, which consists of Suva City\u2014the national capital\u2014as well as the \ntowns of Lami, Nasinu, and Nausori and their surrounding peri-urban areas, accounts for 57% of \nFiji\u2019s  urban  population.  By  2021,  the  population  of  the GSA  is  expected to grow  by  16% \n(footnote 5).  \n \n3.  Despite the economic importance of the country\u2019s cities and towns, infrastructure and \nservices  have  not  kept  pace  with  urbanization.  Inadequate  provision  of  infrastructure  and \nservices is contributing to environmental degradation and increased health risks, and acts as a \nbinding constraint to social and economic development. Current planning regulations ban high-\ndensity  urban  development  in  unsewered  areas.  Because  existing  sewerage  infrastructure \ncovers only 40% of the GSA, the lack of adequate wastewater infrastructure has constrained \nhigh density development, and contributed to urban sprawl and environmental degradation. \nAccess to improved water supply services among the urban population is close to 100%, but \nlevels of nonrevenue water are high at about 50%. \n \n4.  Urbanization in the GSA is driving the emergence of a metropolitan area that stretches \nbeyond the administrative boundaries of local city and town councils, and is fuelling the rapid \ngrowth of informal settlements. Most urban growth in the GSA is now occurring in underserviced \nperi-urban areas. While town planning schemes regulate land use within municipalities, peri-\nurban areas within the GSA are managed by rural local authorities. Outdated and unclear \ninstitutional arrangements and legal frameworks are unsuitable for addressing today\u2019s urban \ndevelopment challenges. There are a variety of mandates and jurisdictions for different tiers of \nauthority  for  urban  development.  This  administrative  fragmentation  has  resulted  in  weak \nalignment between spatial planning and urban infrastructure investments in the GSA.  \n \n5.  The limited supply of affordable, serviced residential land in urban centers has resulted \nin the emergence of informal settlements. In 2011, an estimated 44,000 people, or 17% of the \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2013. Fiji: Update. Manila. IN.130-13. In preparation for future reengagement following elections in 2014, \nADB has committed to mobilizing TA to undertake background studies to foster sustainable infrastructure \ndevelopment, and examine options for upgrading urban settlements and services. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 14 November 2013.  \n3  United  Nations  Statistics  Division.

Manila. \n ", "2   \nGSA population, were living in 86 informal settlements in the GSA.6 Informal settlements are \noften located in marginal, low-lying or flood-prone land in mangrove swamps and foreshore \nareas. The absence of improved sanitation and other urban infrastructure exacerbates the poor \nliving conditions.  \n \n6.  The country\u2019s Urban Policy Action Plan, developed with ADB assistance, is intended to \nsupport  efficient,  effective,  and  sustainable  urban  development  that  can  make  an  optimal \ncontribution to the social, economic, and environmental development of Fiji.7 It aims to (i) \nexpand the capacity of local and central government to meet mandates and stakeholder needs; \n(ii) improve urban infrastructure and services; (iii) establish responsive institutional, regulatory, \nand policy frameworks for the management of urban development; and (iv) provide financing \nmechanisms to enable greater investment in urban infrastructure. Under this plan, an urban \ngrowth management plan (UGMAP) was developed for the GSA, which aims to strategically \naddress critical urbanization issues with a focus on peri-urban areas and informal settlements. It \nemphasizes promoting integrated urban management at the metropolitan level. Implementation \nof the UGMAP has been constrained by a lack of capacity within the agencies responsible for \nurban development in the GSA.  \n \n7.  ADB is providing support to the Water Authority of Fiji (WAF) through the Suva\u2013Nausori \nWater Supply and Sewerage Project, which was approved in 2003.8 The project is supporting (i) \nan increase in the delivery of safe water supply and sewerage services in the Suva\u2013Nausori \nurban area, and (ii) institutional reforms to make the water supply and sewerage services more \nsustainable, and (iii) strengthened water supply and sewerage management and operations, \nand  environmental  monitoring.  While  the  project  has  contributed  to  increased  sewerage \ncoverage, expanded wastewater treatment capacity, and improved reliability of water supply \nservices in the GSA, additional investments are needed to meet the water supply and sanitation \nneeds of the growing urban population.  \n \n8.  In absence of adequate urban planning and management arrangements, existing urban \ndevelopment challenges will become even more acute over time as the population of the GSA \nincreases. An up-to-date metropolitan-level urban planning framework is needed to guide critical \ninvestments in basic infrastructure services, particularly in informal settlement areas, to support \nmore sustainable and inclusive urban development in the GSA. Enhanced coordination among \nconcerned national and local government agencies, and strengthened institutional capacity, are \nalso critical for improved urban management. \n \n9.  The TA is consistent with the aims of the government\u2019s Urban Policy Action Plan and \nADB\u2019s Pacific Approach, 2010\u20132014, which identifies urban development, water, and sanitation \nas operational priorities.9 The TA is also in line with the Urban Operational Plan, 2012\u20132020, \nwhich promotes livable cities that are green, competitive, and socially inclusive; and the Water \nOperational Plan, 2011\u20132020, which promotes more efficient water use across users, and \nexpanded wastewater management and reuse including sanitation.10 \n                                                \n6  Cities Development Initiative for Asia. 2012.

The impact of the project will be efficient, sustainable and inclusive urban development. \nThe outcome of the project will be strengthened national urban development policies and plans. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  Output  1:  The  Urban  Growth  Management  Plan  for  the  Greater  Suva  Area  is \nupdated by the Department of Town and Country Planning. The UGMAP for the GSA will be \nreviewed and updated to reflect changes to urban development trends that have taken place \nover the past 10 years, as well as expected future growth patterns in the GSA. The updated \nUGMAP will include the development of a metropolitan-level spatial plan to guide future growth \nand infrastructure planning. Hazard and climate change risk assessments will be carried out to \ninform land use planning in the GSA. The capacity of the Department of Town and Country \nPlanning will be strengthened using a \u201clearning by doing\u201d approach to prepare TA outputs. The \nupdated UGMAP will be used to guide, coordinate, and prioritize land development and public \ninfrastructure investments in the GSA. \n \n12.  Output 2: The Suva\u2013Nausori Water Supply and Sewerage Master Plan is reviewed \nand high-priority investments are assessed by the Water Authority of Fiji. Water supply \nand sewerage infrastructure are key determinants of existing and future urban growth patterns \nin the GSA. WAF has prepared a water supply and sewerage master plan for the Suva\u2013Nausori \narea. The master plan will be reviewed and updated, guided by the UGMAP, and feasibility and \ndue diligence assessments will be carried out on high-priority water and sewerage investments \nto support sustainable urban development in the GSA. Associated training will carried out to \nbuild WAF\u2019s strategic planning capacity through an expansion of current twinning arrangements \nto ensure sustainable delivery of water supply and sewerage services.11  \n \n13.  Output 3: An urban management board for the Greater Suva Area is established \nby the Ministry of Local Government, Urban Development, Housing and Environment. \nThe feasibility of establishing an urban management board for the GSA under the Ministry of \nLocal  Government,  Urban  Development,  Housing  and  Environment  (MLGUDHE),  as \nrecommended  in  the  UGMAP,  will  be  assessed.  The  board  will  support  strengthened \nmetropolitan-level coordination of urban planning and management in the GSA among urban \ndevelopment stakeholders, including national and local government agencies, utility service \nproviders, and the private sector. A detailed implementation plan for the board\u2019s establishment \nwill be developed and initiated after its endorsement by key stakeholders. \n \n14.  The  TA  assumes  that  urban  development  will  remain  a  key  national  development \npriority. Current and earlier national development plans identify housing, urban infrastructure \ndevelopment, and urban institutional reforms as key development priorities. There is a risk that \npriority  measures  and  investments  identified  in  the  UGMAP  and  the  Suva\u2013Nausori  Water \nSupply and Sewerage Master Plan may be not be implemented as a result of capacity and \nfinancing constraints. To mitigate this risk, the TA seeks to address capacity gaps in critical \n                                                \n11  ADB. 2007.

Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,150,000 equivalent, of which (i) $800,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Others); and (ii) $350,000 \nwill be financed on a grant basis by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund12 under the Water Financing \nPartnership Facility and administered by ADB.  \n \n16.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of (i) documents, data, \nstatistics, information, and maps that it has at its disposal; (ii) an adequate number of qualified \ncounterpart  staff,  including  remuneration  and  per  diem;  (iii)  office  accommodation  and \nequipment,  including  desks,  chairs,  and  photocopiers;  (iv)  logistical  assistance  for  the \nworkshops and seminars, including venue provision; and (v) other in-kind contributions. The \ncost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The executing agency for the TA will be the Ministry of Strategic Planning, National \nDevelopment  and  Statistics  (MSPNDS).  The MSPNDS  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating \nactivities among relevant agencies, and ensuring that TA outputs are consistent with national \ndevelopment objectives. The MLGUDHE will be the implementing agency for the project, and \nwill supervise all tasks performed by the consultants. A national steering committee will be \nestablished  to  oversee  and  monitor  TA  implementation.  The  permanent  secretary  of  the \nMSPNDS will chair the national steering committee, which will comprise of senior officials from \nthe Ministry of Finance; the MLGUDHE; the Ministry of Works, Transport, and Public Utilities; \nand WAF. The national steering committee will convene on a quarterly basis to guide and \nassess overall TA implementation progress. \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented from 1 March 2014 to 30 September 2015. The outline \nterms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. International expertise (24.5 person-\nmonths) will be obtained in the areas of urban planning, urban management, water supply and \nwastewater infrastructure planning and engineering, social development, gender and poverty \nanalysis, natural hazard and climate risk assessment, economic analysis, and environmental \nsafeguards and resettlement. National consultants (33 person-months) will have expertise in \nurban planning, water supply and wastewater engineering, community participation and social \ndevelopment, geographic information systems, and computer-aided design.  \n \n19.  The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants by ADB (2013, as amended from time to time). A national urban planner will be \nrecruited on an individual basis. All the other consultants will be selected and engaged through \na firm based on a simplified technical proposal under the quality- and cost-based selection \nprocess, using a 90:10 weighting. A full technical proposal will be used for the selection of the \nconsulting firm. The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance with the Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Equipment, such as \ncomputers, printers, and associated consumables, will be procured using the shopping method, \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). All \nequipment purchased under the TA will be turned over to the MLGUDHE after TA completion.  \n                                                \n12   Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. ", "  5 \n \n20.  The consultants will assist the government in organizing consultation workshops and \nforming  working groups  to  ensure  adequate stakeholder  participation and  dissemination of \nresults during TA implementation. These forums will ensure that inputs from a broad range of \nstakeholders are adequately reflected in the design of TA outputs to ensure local ownership, \nand that good practice and lessons learned during TA implementation are widely shared.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $350,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership \nFacility; and (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant \nbasis, to the Government of Fiji for Urban Development Planning and Institutional Capacity \nBuilding, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1                       \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \nDesign  and Indicators with  Reporting \nSummary  Baselines  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nEfficient, sustainable,  Access to sewerage  National statistical  Government is able to \nand inclusive urban  services in the GSA  reports  mobilize sufficient resources \ndevelopment  increases to 60% by    to undertake priority urban \n  2020 (baseline: 40%  WAF reports  infrastructure investments. \nin 2013)     \n  Risks \nUptake of services among \nhouseholds is low. \n \nDevelopment partner support \nis limited. \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nStrengthened national  Number of households  MLGUDHE reports  Government remains \nurban development  targeted by informal    committed to promoting \npolicies and plans  settlement upgrading  National budget  inclusive urban development \n  initiatives increases to  documents  as national priority \n5,000 per year by   \n2016 (baseline: 2,260   \nin 2014) \n \nOutputs       Assumptions \n1.
