INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Armenia requested assistance from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to improve the financial and physical sustainability of its road and water sectors. In \nconsultation with stakeholders in the public and private sectors, a policy and advisory technical \nassistance (TA) concept was developed in October 2012.1 Pursuant to concept clearance, a \nfact-finding mission visited Armenia from 12 to 15 November 2012 to discuss TA scope and \nimplementation arrangements with the government.2 Extensive consultations with public and \nprivate sector service providers, end users, and development partners3 ensure that the TA \nbuilds on ongoing reform and capacity building in the road and water sectors. This TA report \nreflects  agreement  reached  with  the  government  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA. \nThe design and monitoring framework is provided in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Armenia\u2019s economy is still recovering from the 2009 global financial crisis. Structural \nreforms begun in 1999 and recent fiscal consolidation work support recovery. Tax policy reforms \nare moving forward. There have been modest improvements in tax administration,  but raising \nrevenues  has  been  challenging.4 The  infrastructure  bill  is  growing,  as  aging  assets  need \noperational maintenance or replacement and new large investments are planned. Recent stress \ntests signal fiscal fragility. The economy is expected to grow by 4.3% in 2012,5 but the crisis and \nthe countercyclical fiscal package have crowded out fiscal space. The ratio of government and \ngovernment-guaranteed debt to gross domestic product soared from 16.1% in 2008 to 41.7% at \nthe end of 2011.6 External debt for project finance and budget support accounted for 84.5% of \ntotal government debt as of 30 September 2012.7 Public debt service is projected to increase, \nwith substantial debt repayments clustered in 2013 and 2014.8  \n \n3.  A more proactive approach is needed to safeguard growth-sustaining public expenditure, \nenable continued investment in productive capacity, and ensure adequate, sustainable service \ndelivery. Economic growth facilitated by improved infrastructure remains a key development \nchallenge.9 The  physical  and financial  sustainability  of  infrastructure  assets  is  at  risk. The \ngrowing mismatch between financing needs and resources and the efficient public management \nof infrastructure demand closer attention from policy makers and practitioners.  \n \n                                                \n1  The TA and subsequent policy-based loan for infrastructure sustainability support were included in ADB. 2012. \nCountry Operations Business Plan (Update): Armenia, 2012\u20132013. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 13 November 2012.  \n3  Development partners with public finance, transport, and water portfolios in Armenia include the International \nMonetary Fund, the World Bank, German development cooperation through GIZ and KfW, the European Bank for \nReconstruction and Development, the European Investment Bank, the European Union Delegation, and the United \nStates Agency for International Development. \n4  A tax policy strategy for 2013\u20132015 and a tax administration strategy for 2012\u20132014 have been developed to \nimprove tax buoyancy. Annual tax revenue increases by 0.4% of gross domestic product are targeted for 2013\u2013\n2015. International Monetary Fund Note, Republic of Armenia, October 2012. \n5   ADB. 2012.

Institutional reforms in public financial management, including program budgeting, have \nbeen initiated with the government\u2019s Strategy for Reforming the Public Financial Management \nSystem (October 2010). German development cooperation through GIZ has supported Ministry \nof Finance (MOF) implementation of program budgeting, including development of program \npassports  on  a  pilot  basis, 10  and  curriculum  development  for  MOF\u2019s  public  financial \nmanagement training center. The European Union and the Organisation for Economic Co-\noperation and Development have been supporting Armenia\u2019s public internal financial control \nsystem, including internal audit and procurement, since October 2008. The World Bank has \nbeen  supporting  the  modernization  of  the  internal  audit  system  in  Armenia  through  the \nintroduction of a new methodology and a unified information system. ADB has partnered with \nthe World Bank in developing the audit capacity of MOF staff.11 These reforms have not been \nfully applied at sector level, including in infrastructure sectors. \n \n5.  Among infrastructure sectors, road and water demand the closest attention. They feature \nprominently in the government\u2019s development agenda given their direct social, economic, and \nregional  impact.  They  also  account  for  a  substantial  portion  of  public  expenditures  on \ninfrastructure and of ADB support to Armenia. A results-based management (RBM) framework \nhas been introduced to these sectors, but its application to planning, budgeting, and monitoring \nprocesses still requires institutional mainstreaming and capacity development. 12 \n \n6.  Demand in these two sectors continues to outpace service provision. Private sector \nparticipation  in  these  sectors  has  been  supported  by  the  government,  and  it  has  yielded \nencouraging results in the water sector.13 Public sector capacity to engage in and manage \ndifferent partnership modalities with private service providers can be further developed. Private \nparticipation in public service delivery may be systematically integrated into sector development \nstrategies.  The  institutional  and  regulatory  framework  in  these  sectors  is  unclear.  Service \ndelivery standards and the regulation of services reflecting delivery standards would contribute \nto end-user satisfaction. While various agencies are tasked with different aspects of sector \nregulation, there is no single sector regulator. A consolidated and coherent approach is needed. \n \n7.  Sound sector strategies based on Armenia\u2019s development goals, allocation of budgetary \nresources  to  achieve  sector  targets,  efficient  spending,  systematic  results  monitoring,  and \nprudent management of the overall resource envelope are important. Budget allocations for \ninvestment in fixed assets, and for their operation and maintenance, have been insufficient for \nsustainability. Linkages among sector development targets, annual work plans, and budget \nallocations  are  tenuous.  Clear  criteria  for  identifying  and  prioritizing  sector  capital  and \noperational  expenditures  are  needed.  Systematic  expenditure  management  with  results \nmonitoring would provide powerful management and planning tools. \n                                                \n10 Passports are public information documents prepared on budget programs for the use of policy makers, budget \nand implementation managers, and other stakeholders. They indicate each program\u2019s (i) objective; (ii) design, \nfinancing resources, and implementation arrangements; and (iii) output and outcome performance indicators and \ntargets. \n11 ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance for Support for Implementation of the Second Governance and Anticorruption \nPlan. Manila (TA 6445-REG). The TA was approved on 18 February 2008 for $2,600,000. \n12 Results-based management is a management strategy focusing on performance and achievement of outputs, \noutcomes, and impact. (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. 2004. Glossary of Key Terms \nin Evaluation and Results Based Management. Paris.) \n13 The Armenian Water Sewerage Company is under a management contract from 2004 to 2013 with Saur. The Lori, \nShirak, and Nor Aqunk regional water companies are under a management contract until 2013 with the MVV \nDecon GmbH, MVV Energie AG, and AEG Service LLC consortium. Yerevan Djur is under a 10-year lease \ncontract from 2006 to 2016 with Veolia. These utility companies service more than two-thirds of all users in \nArmenia. \n ", "           3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n8.  The TA will improve the sustainability of the road and water sectors through RBM. \nStarting with assessments of existing institutions, regulatory frameworks, and public financial \nmanagement practices in the two sectors, the TA will identify gaps and recommend how they \nmay be addressed. TA outputs and findings will be used to design a proposed policy-based loan \nfor implementation starting in the second half of 2013. The TA will support the government\u2019s \ndevelopment agenda on sustainable infrastructure provision as articulated in the Draft Armenia \nDevelopment Strategy 2012\u20132025; Medium-Term Expenditure Framework 2012\u20132014;14 and \nthe Republic of Armenia Government Program.15 The TA closely aligns with ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2020;16 the Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020;17 the country development priorities identified \nin  the  Economic  Report  and  Interim  Operational  Strategy  2006\u20132009; 18 annual  country \noperations business plans for 2008\u20132010, 19 for 2012\u20132013,20 and the 2012\u20132013 Update;21 \nand Country Strategy Final Review 2006\u20132011.22 The TA will pilot a hybrid approach, using \npublic management tools to improve efficiency in infrastructure sectors. It will thus support and \ncomplement the Central and West Asia Department\u2019s ongoing interventions in Armenia\u2019s road \nand water sectors. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be the improved results-based management of the road and water \nsectors in Armenia by 2015. Achievement of the impact will be monitored through the effective \nuse and application of sector performance targets for the medium-term expenditure framework \n(MTEF) and the budgeting, budget and outturn reporting, and audit processes. \n \n10.  The outcome will be budget and MTEF-linked RBM frameworks for the road and water \nsectors. These frameworks will be piloted starting with the 2014 budget cycle. Efficiency gains \nfrom better resource utilization and expenditure management in these sectors are expected to \nimprove the quality, coverage, and delivery of public services. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will support the government\u2019s results-based management of the road and water \nsectors.  It  will  start  by  updating  and  completing  assessments  of  institutional,  legal,  and \nregulatory  frameworks,  and  public  financial  management  practices,  in  the  road  and  water \nsectors.  Initial  stocktaking  will  include  a  thorough  review  of  the  ongoing  initiatives  of  the \ngovernment,  ADB,  and  other  development  partners,  after  which  baselines  for  capacity \ndevelopment and future reform areas will be established. The government has been working \ntoward applying RBM in budget and MTEF preparation since 2008, developing staff capacity \nand the necessary institutional framework. The TA will help develop a roadmap in 2013 to \nemploy results-based budgeting and planning in the road and water sectors starting with the \n2014 budget.  \n                                                \n14 Government of Armenia. 2011.

This approach will identify key performance indicators according to development targets \nrather than activities. This framework will then be used to plan sector investment priorities for \ncapital and operational expenditures, reflecting these priorities in annual budgets and the MTEF. \nProgress will be monitored through passports at the project and program level in the road and \nwater sectors. The capacity of internal audit units in these two sectors will be strengthened to \naudit programs at the sector level. A key constraint in both sectors is the government\u2019s limited \nresource envelope. Determining resource requirements for sector targets will help identify the \nfinancial instruments, modalities, and partners needed to achieve them. Innovative financing \noptions and mechanisms will be explored, including partnerships with domestic and international \nprivate sector partners for public service delivery, will be explored. Staff capacity to effectively \nimplement results-based management frameworks will be developed through on-the-job training \nand workshops.  \n \n13.  The TA will pilot an integrated approach to public management and service delivery. It \nwill  link  (i)  typically  discrete  policy  interventions  in  public  sector  management  and  project \ninterventions in infrastructure sectors, and (ii) sector ministries with MOF through planning, \nbudgeting, audit, and monitoring processes to improve sector management and infrastructure \nsustainability. Knowledge gained during TA implementation will be distilled in a case study to \nshare this approach and its application to other sectors and countries. \n \n14.  Specific TA outputs will include (i) updating the assessments for road and water sectors \nprepared with baselines and gap analysis; (ii) developing road and water key performance \nindicators for sector and budget management; (iii) piloting results-based passports developed \nfor roads and water and using them in budget formulation; (iv) developing financing options and \nstrategies for public and private participation in the roads sector; and (v) strengthening the \ncapacity of internal audit unit staff in the Ministry of Transport and Communication and the State \nCommittee of Water System of the Ministry of Territorial Administration to audit programs. \n \n15.  Active  and  timely  contributions  from  counterpart  staff  are  important  to  effective  TA \nimplementation. It is assumed that budget and audit systems, processes, and staff will be in \nplace and facilitate TA implementation as planned. Risks derive from the political economy \ncontext and capacity gaps. Presidential elections are scheduled for February 2013, early in TA \nimplementation. Any substantial change in executing and implementing agency counterpart staff \nafter the elections may delay implementation as ownership and support for TA deliverables are \nre-established.  Human  resource  gaps  and  the  challenges  of  changing  current  public \nmanagement practices, especially in public financial management, will be managed through \ncapacity  development  and  continued  dialogue  with  policy  makers,  practitioners,  and \nstakeholders during TA implementation. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  and \nfacilitation of expert team\u2019s timely access to information and stakeholders, and other in-kind \ncontributions. All disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with the Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Detailed TA cost \nestimates are in Appendix 2. \n \n ", "           5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  MOF will be the TA executing agency, and the Foreign Financing Project Management \nCenter in MOF the implementing agency. The TA will be implemented from January 2013 to \nApril 2014. \n \n18.  The TA will engage three international consultants for 7 person-months and five national \nconsultants  for  13  person-months  to  provide  policy  advice  and  technical  and  capacity \ndevelopment during TA implementation. In accordance with the hybrid, multisector approach of \nthe TA, the consultant team will include an international public financial management and/or \npublic sector management specialist (3 person-months) who will be team leader; a national \npublic  financial  management  specialist  (5  person-months);  a  national  public  sector  audit \nspecialist (2 person-months); an international transport (roads) specialist (2 person-months); a \nnational  transport  (roads)  specialist  (2  person-months);  an  international  water  supply  and \nsanitation specialist (2 person-months); a national water supply and sanitation specialist (2 \nperson-months);  and  a  national  legal  expert  (2  person-months).  As  the  skills  mix  and \nqualifications required from consultants are diverse and difficult to source from a single firm, \nADB  will  engage  consultants  individually  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The ADB TA team and the implementing \nagency  will  coordinate  and  supervise  consultant  outputs.  Detailed  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants are in Appendix 3. The consultants will submit (i) inception reports 2 weeks after \ntheir services start, (ii) interim progress reports at appropriate stages of TA implementation, (iii) \ndraft final reports before the conclusion of the contract, and (iv) final reports 2 weeks after \nincorporating feedback from the executing agency and ADB.  \n19.  TA findings, frameworks and processes developed will be discussed with stakeholders in \na  series  of  workshops  to  inform,  validate,  build  ownership  for,  and  ensure  functional \nunderstanding  of TA  deliverables  and recommendations.  Timeliness  and  the quality  of TA \noutputs  will  be  monitored  by  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  and  ADB  staff. \nEvaluations will be based on the effective implementation of the results-based management \nframework and processes introduced. A knowledge product will be developed at the end of the \nTA to share information on the hybrid approach used. The TA team will work closely with GIZ, \nKfW, World Bank and other development partners for greater value addition through synergies \namong our respective programs in Armenia. \n \nIV.
