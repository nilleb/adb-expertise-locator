INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) is extraordinarily vulnerable to climate \nchange  due  to  its  (i)  high  socioeconomic  dependence  on  climate-sensitive  sectors  such  as \nagriculture and water, and (ii) low adaptive ability associated with widespread poverty and weak \ntechnical and institutional capacity. In 2008, the Government of the Lao PDR requested that the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) help draft a national strategy and action plan on climate change \n(NSAPCC) for the country. This proposed capacity development technical assistance (TA)1 seeks \nto  overcome  capacity  gaps  identified  in  the  NSAPCC  through  building  institutional  capacity, \nenhancing technical skills, and implementing pilot projects.   \n \n2.  A reconnaissance mission took place in July 2009, and ADB circulated a draft TA concept \npaper for comment by the government ministries in October 2009. A consensus emerged on the \nneed to strengthen the capacity of the eight technical working groups (TWGs) of the National \nSteering Committee on Climate Change, and to pilot various adaptation activities. A fact-finding \nmission with representation from the Nordic Development Fund followed from 26 to 29 October \n2009 to assess capacity needs of the TWGs, scope pilot activities, and discuss modalities of TA \nimplementation. A memorandum of understanding was signed with the director general of the \nEnvironment  Department,  Water  Resources  and  Environment  Administration  (WREA)  on  30 \nOctober 2009, agreeing to the core elements of the TA (impact, outcome, outputs, implementation, \ncost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference of consultants). The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Although it has made steady progress toward achieving Millennium Development Goals, \nthe Lao PDR\u2014and its poorer communities in particular\u2014are likely to suffer increasingly from \nclimate change impacts, which risk reversing these past successes. The NSAPCC notes that the \ndry season is becoming longer, droughts are more frequent and severe, and the incidence of \nextreme flood events is increasing. Between 1966 and 2008, the country experienced about 30 \nflood events, with one in 2008 causing a loss of $58 million. Strengthening climate resilience is \nthus central to the country\u2019s sustainable development and poverty reduction agenda. \n \n4.  The  government  has  shown  a  strong  commitment  to  addressing  climate  change  by \nratifying the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1995 and the Kyoto \nProtocol  in  2003.  It  established  the  National  Climate  Change  Office,  the  National  Steering \nCommittee on Climate Change, and eight TWGs in 2008. In May 2009, it published the National \nAdaptation Program of Action,2 which identified water, agriculture and forestry, and public health \nas high-priority, at-risk sectors due to climate change. It is preparing NSAPCC for approval in \n2010. The NSAPCC focuses on eight areas including (i) building awareness, (ii) strengthening \npolicies  and  institutional  capacity,  (iii)  mainstreaming  climate  change,  (iv)  expanding  the \nknowledge  base,  (v)  building  adaptive  capacity,  (vi)  enhancing  ecosystem  resilience,  (vii) \npromoting comprehensive disaster management, and (viii) mitigating climate change. \n \n5.  However, translating climate change strategies, plans, and programs into concrete actions \nhas been difficult due to constraints on human resources and institutional, technical, and financial \ncapacities. The NSAPCC notes that climate change awareness is limited to a small circle of \ngovernment staff members and that capacity to implement climate policies at the provincial level \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 19 October 2009. \n2  Water Resources and Environment Administration, Lao PDR. 2009. National Adaptation Programme of Action to \nClimate Change. Vientiane. \n ", "2   \nin designated environmental management units is almost nonexistent. The October 2009 fact-\nfinding mission also confirmed that the capacity of the eight TWGs for implementing NSAPCC and \nfor planning and budgeting for adaptation is limited.  \n \n6.  The proposed TA will address these constraints by providing policy support to the National \nClimate Change Office and institutions responsible for each TWG3 to implement the NSAPCC \neffectively. It will also raise public and policy maker awareness on climate change and provide \nassistance for implementing pilot adaptation activities in water, agriculture, and forestry sectors. \nThese  activities  will  also  reinforce  data  collection  systems  on  climate  change  impacts  and \nstrengthen TWG capacity in data collection and analysis. \n \n7.  The proposed TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy,4 which supports the \ngovernment\u2019s priority sectors under the Sixth National Socio-Economic Development Plan, 2006\u2013\n2010,5 with a focus on improving the national and sector-specific enabling environment for poverty \nreduction.  Besides  reforming  sector  governance,  building  sector  capacity,  and  ensuring \nsustainability,  the  strategy  includes  investment  in  infrastructure  projects  that  require \nmainstreaming of climate change concerns. The TA will also complement and strengthen links to \nother ADB projects6 in the Lao PDR. Further, the gap analysis carried out in the preparation of the \nADB  climate  change  implementation  plan7 identified  a  need  for  increased  support  to  policy \nmakers to take proactive roles in planning national and regional climate change programs. The TA \nwill  support  integration  of  climate  change  considerations  into  development,  another  need \nidentified as a priority activity in this plan.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  Impact. The TA\u2019s main impact will be better climate-resilient development in the Lao PDR, \nleading to improved livelihoods, especially for vulnerable groups including women. The TA will \ntake  a  holistic  view  of  adaptation,  including  strengthening  the  country\u2019s  access  to  financial \ninstruments available under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and \nthe Kyoto Protocol, such as the Least Developed Countries Fund and Adaptation Fund. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n3  The eight TWGs and the associated institutions are (i) agriculture, land use, and forestry\u2014National Agriculture and \nForestry Research Institute, Department of Forestry, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF), Department of \nPlanning  and  Land  Development,  and  Prime  Minister's  Office;  (ii)  water  resources\u2014Water  Resources  and \nEnvironment Research Institute; (iii) energy\u2014Environmental and Social Division, Ministry of Energy and Mines; (iv) \nurban infrastructure\u2014Department of Transport, Ministry of Public Works and Transport; (v) public health\u2014Division \nof Hygiene and Disease Prevention, Ministry of Health; (vi) economy\u2014National Economic Research Institute; (vii) \nfinancial instruments\u2014Ministry of Finance; and (viii) clean production\u2014Ministry of Industry and Commerce. \n4   ADB.  2007.

The expected outcome of the TA will be an improved enabling environment to \ncope with climate change impacts. The TA will enhance the climate resilience of programs, plans, \nand/or policies by building institutional capacity for planning, budgeting, and implementing climate \nchange actions; applying a learning-by-doing approach; and strengthening the information base \nfor  decision  making,  such  as  through  economic  assessments  and  the  development  of \nmethodologies for scaling up climate change actions. Capacity-building activities will be targeted \nat technical staff members and senior decision makers within the government. Pilot activities will \nallow the TA methodologies and outcomes to be replicated elsewhere and the TA benefits to be \ndisseminated throughout the country. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The proposed TA will involve six outputs grouped under two components: (i) capacity \ndevelopment and technical support, and (ii) pilot adaptation activities in priority sectors.  \n \n1.  Capacity Development and Technical Support \n11.  Assessment of investment and financial flows. To provide a sound economic basis for \naction, an assessment of investment and financial flows necessary to address climate change \nimpacts will be undertaken in the water, agriculture, and energy sectors using methodological \nframeworks such as those being piloted by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). \nThe  assessment  will  serve  as  a  long-term  planning  tool  and  provide  input  to  budgeting  for \nadaptation as well as for raising additional financing from external sources. \n \n12.  Technical assistance and policy support to the technical working groups. As the \nTWG structure of the National Climate Change Office coordinates climate change adaptation and \nmitigation across multiple sectors and government bodies, the TA will engage the TWGs in \ndeveloping  pragmatic  work  plans  to  realize  the  national  climate  change  strategy.  Training \nmodules  on  planning  and  budgeting  for  adaptation  actions,  opportunities  for  maximizing  co-\nbenefits of these actions, and approaches for enhancing climate resilience of current and future \ninvestments will be drawn up. Further, since disaster risk management and climate change \nadaptation  intersect,  the  TWGs  will  also  be  encouraged  to  coordinate  closely  with  National \nDisaster Management Office at the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare. Training activities will be \nconducted in cooperation with the World Bank, which provided initial support to TWGs, and other \nbilateral and multilateral donors such as the United Nations Development Programme. \n \n13.  Education,  training,  and  public  awareness-raising  campaign. The TA will include \npublic awareness programs on climate change aimed specifically at youth, women, community \nleaders, and senior citizens. Training programs will target government personnel in both national \nand  provincial  environmental  management  units  to  build  skills  in  economics,  policy  making, \nplanning,  and  budgeting  related  to  climate  change  through  learning-by-doing  activities,  staff \nexchanges, study tours, and participation in local and national training events and forums. This \noutput will help government representatives to forge long-term relationships with climate change \nprofessionals  in  both  the  Lao  PDR  and  other  countries.  Moreover,  theme-specific  training \nprograms  on  adaptation  in  selected  sectors  (e.g.,  water,  agriculture,  and  forestry)  will  be \nconducted to present guidelines and operational manuals to extension personnel to implement \nspecific adaptation projects and to apply for international funds such as the Adaptation Fund.  \n \n14.  Collaborative  mechanisms  for  information  dissemination  and  additional  pilot \nactivities. This output, under the leadership of WREA, will include (i) disseminating lessons from \nthe TA both nationally and internationally; (ii) supporting regional advisory and information-sharing \n ", "4   \nbodies such as forums organized by the Mekong River Commission through its climate change \nadaptation initiative; and (iii) designing additional pilot activities to allow eventual scaling up and \nreplication of the TA outcomes. The costs for implementing additional pilot activities will be \nestimated, and financing options will be identified to assist the government in their implementation \nfollowing this TA\u2019s closure.   \n \n2.  Pilot Adaptation Activities in Priority Sectors \n15.  Pilot climate change adaptation activities in water, agriculture, and forestry sectors will be \nimplemented on the basis of criteria such as the potential for scaling up, feasibility, alignment with \nnational  strategies,  impacts  on  vulnerable  groups,  and  opportunities  for  poverty  reduction. \nAdditional criteria may be developed in consultation with concerned ministries. The scope of each \npilot activity will be determined on the basis of participatory rural appraisal and other bottom-up \napproaches. Impacts on adaptive capacity will also be monitored. \n \n16.  Water sector. Under the leadership of WREA, the proposed TA will pilot activities for \ncoping with droughts in a northern province and floods in a southern province. The drought pilot \nactivity will focus on improved water conservation using groundwater recharge and bioengineering. \nThe flood pilot activity will center on climate proofing infrastructure, including changing the design \nof embankments, culverts, and irrigation and drainage channels. Both pilots will be implemented \nby provincial water resources and environment offices and will build on current ADB projects in \nthese provinces. \n \n17.  Agriculture and forestry sectors. These pilot activities will use an ecosystem-based \napproach to climate change adaptation and include (i) climate proofing infrastructure, such as \nrural roads; (ii) integrating indigenous knowledge in local adaptation plans; and (iii) adopting \nstress-tolerant cropping systems and varieties, focusing on rice ecosystems. Activities featuring \ngreenhouse  gas  mitigation  and  other  co-benefits  (e.g.,  air  quality,  health  improvement,  and \nemployment generation) will be prioritized, including (i) biogas generation from farm waste; (ii) \ncarbon sequestration through agroforestry, afforestation, and reforestation; and (iii) system of rice \nintensification to reduce energy use and methane emissions. Efforts will also be made to promote \nbiogas as a commercially viable industry by expanding its use for cooking, lighting, and water \npumping, which will reduce deforestation caused by fuelwood needs. The pilot activities will be \nimplemented  by  the  provincial  agriculture  and  forestry  offices  in  close  cooperation  with  the \nMinistry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) and the National Agriculture and Forestry Research \nInstitute. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the proposed TA is estimated at $3.4 million. It will be financed on a grant \nbasis by Nordic Development Fund in the amount of \u20ac2.0 million (about $2.8 million) and ADB's \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013IV) in the amount of $300,000. The government will \nprovide $300,000 equivalent in-kind, through provision of counterpart staff members. The grant \nfrom the Nordic Development Fund will be administered by ADB and utilized on a front-loading \nbasis. The cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The proposed TA will be implemented over 30 months from March 2010 to September \n2012 in close cooperation with the National Steering Committee on Climate Change and its TWGs. \nWREA will be the executing agency, and the National Steering Committee on Climate Change will \n ", "  5\nserve  as  the  TA  steering  committee.  The  implementing  agencies  will  be  the  line  ministries \nresponsible for the target sectors, that is, MAF, the Ministry of Energy and Mines, and WREA. \nOther  line  ministries  and  agencies,  provincial  water  resources  and environment  offices,  and \nprovincial agriculture and forestry offices will be involved through workshops and forums, direct \nconsultations, and pilot implementation. The director general of the Department of Environment at \nWREA, as the project director, will monitor and guide implementation. WREA will keep ADB and \nthe Nordic Development Fund informed of any significant deviations from the agreed project \nimplementation  schedule.  Within  3  months  of  TA  completion,  WREA  will  submit  a  project \ncompletion report.  \n \n20.  An international consulting firm will be recruited following quality- and cost-based selection \n(80:20) in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime to time). The firm will provide 40 person-months of international and 90 person-months of \nnational consulting services. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \nThe TA team leader will be located at WREA, but consultants will also work in the agencies \nresponsible  for  the  eight  TWGs  or  the  provincial  offices  (for  implementing  pilot  adaptation \nactivities). Procurement and disbursement will be done in accordance with ADB's Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook.8 Upon completion of the TA, all procured assets will be turned over to WREA. Funds \nfor office equipment, workshops, training seminars and conferences, and administrative support \nand reporting will be managed by WREA. Funds for pilot adaptation activities will be managed by \nthe implementing agencies:9 WREA for water pilot activities and MAF for agriculture and forestry \npilot activities. WREA and MAF will maintain separate accounts; have these accounts and related \nfinancial statements audited annually by an external auditor in accordance with auditing standards \nacceptable to ADB; and submit to ADB, within 6 months of the close of the fiscal year, certified \ncopies of audited project accounts and financial statements and auditor's reports, all in English.  \n \n21.  For  funds  to  be  expended  by  WREA  and  MAF,  an  advance  payment  facility will  be \nestablished at the Bank of Lao PDR. Its ceiling amount will be based on estimated expenditure on \na quarterly basis based on agreed work plans, not exceeding $300,000. The account will be \nestablished,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook and arrangements agreed upon by the government and ADB. \nThe  statement  of  expenditures  procedure  will  be  used  to  reimburse  or  liquidate  eligible \nexpenditures. Each individual payment reimbursed or liquidated using this procedure will not \nexceed $100,000 equivalent. Use of the Ministry of Finance's bidding documents for national \nshopping and competitive bidding is encouraged. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION AND DECISION \n22.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  a  portion  of \ntechnical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,800,000 to the Government of the Lao \nPeople's Democratic Republic for Capacity Enhancement for Coping with Climate Change, to be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Nordic  Development  Fund.  If  the  Board  approves  ADB \nadministering the technical assistance, the President, acting under the authority delegated by the \nBoard, will approve ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a \ngrant basis, for Capacity Enhancement for Coping with Climate Change. \n \n \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2008.
