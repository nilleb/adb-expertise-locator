An initial environmental examination was undertaken, and \nAssessment  a summary environmental analysis is in Appendix 12. The summary \ninitial environmental examination is in Supplementary Appendix P. \n   \nProject Description  The  Qingdao  Water  Resources  and  Wetland  Protection  Project \nrepresents a major environmental improvement investment in Jiaozhou \nBay, including Jiaozhou City and protection of its downstream wetlands. \nIt  is  classified  as  a  targeted  intervention  because  it  contributes  to \nachieving Millennium Development Goal 7, target 10, which calls for \nhalving by 2015 the proportion of people without access to safe drinking \nwater and improved sanitation. The Project will bring tangible benefits to \nthe environment of Jiaozhou City and the bay area by (i) reducing water \npollution; (ii) protecting water resources; (iii) reducing economic losses \nand  disruption  to  livelihoods  from  frequent  localized  flooding;  (iv) \nenhancing wetland ecosystems in both Shaohai Lake and the Dagu \nEstuary/Jiaozhou  Bay  wetlands;  (v)  promoting  sustainable  economic \ndevelopment;  (vi)  improving  the  environment,  living  conditions,  and \npublic health standards; and (vii) strengthening public service delivery \nthrough  corporatization  and  improved  financial  sustainability.  The \nimpact of the Project will be enhanced by the replication of project \nlessons learned in other newly developed zones within the Qingdao \nmunicipal  government  (QMG)  by  the  implementation  of  a  strategic \nenvironmental assessment (SEA).   \n \nThe Project has three key outputs: (i) improved water resources and \nflood  management,  including  (a)  dredging,  embankment,  and \nrehabilitation of four river courses with a total length of 19.5 kilometers \n(km); (b) upgrading flood retention facilities; and (c) constructing about \n11.4 km of storm sewers; (ii) strengthening wastewater management \nand  pollution  control,  including  (a)  constructing  about  15.9  km  of \ninterceptor  sewers,  (b)  establishing  about  11.8  km  of  additional \nsewerage networks to supplement the existing trunk sewerage, and (c) \nsupporting  the  establishment  of  a  wastewater  treatment  plant  with \nprivate sector involvement for an additional 50,000 cubic meters per \nday;  and  (iii)  integrated  water  and  ecosystem  management.  The \nintegrated information system for Jiaozhou flood, water, and wastewater \nmanagement  and  the  related  emergency  response  system  will  be \nestablished.  Management  of  the  downstream  Shaohai  Lake  will  be ", "ii \nstrengthened  by  (i)  improving  biodiversity  monitoring  capacities;  (ii) \nestablishing  surface  water  flow,  water  quality,  and  other  ecosystem \nparameters;  and  (iii)  establishing  a  hydraulic  and  water  quality \nsimulation  tool.  The  goal  of  protecting  environmental  conditions  in \nJiaozhou  Bay  and  preserving  wetland  areas  will  be  reinforced  by \nstrengthening  both  Qingdao\u2019s  and  Jiaozhou\u2019s  integrated  planning \ncapabilities through preparation of an SEA aimed at providing guidance \nfor environmental management in Qingdao Municipality.   \n   \nRationale  Most of the water management problems in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC), particularly in coastal cities, are the result of a fragmented \napproach to development. There is a need to move towards a more \nintegrated  management  approach  whereby  the  different  tasks \nassociated  with  water  management  (water  supply,  wastewater \nmanagement, and drainage) and ecosystem rehabilitation are managed \ntogether in close coordination with land-use planning, coastal zone and \nwater resource management, and pollution control at the river basin \nlevel. To reduce pollution in the country\u2019s coastal waters and sustain \necosystems,  a  number  of  specific  actions  are  needed,  including  (i) \nadopting a holistic approach to water management in river basins and \ncoastal zones; (ii) reducing land-based pollution sources, particularly \nfrom industrial and urban sources; and (iii) continuing institutional and \nfinancial  management  reforms  to  facilitate  sustainable  environment \nmanagement.   \n \nThe  coastal  wetlands  of  Jiaozhou  Bay  surrounded  by  Qingdao \nMunicipality (including Jiaozhou City at the head of the bay) are vital; \nthey represent the most important marine ecosystem of the Qingdao \ncoastal region and the Shandong Peninsula. They provide breeding \ngrounds  for  many  types  of  fish  and  shellfish,  a  resting  place  for \nmigratory birds, and a habitat for other coastal biological diversity. In \naddition, they play a key role in absorbing excessive nutrients from \nland-based activities before the nutrients enter the waters of the bay \nproper, thereby helping to prevent eutrophication in the bay. Finally, the \nwetlands play a key role in flood management and coastal protection, \nwhich  will  be  increasingly  significant  to  coastal  cities  as  sea  levels \ncontinue to rise as a result of global warming. Since the 1950s, the \ncoastal wetlands around Jiaozhou Bay have been severely impacted by \nhuman  activities,  notably  in  relation  to  excessive  pollution.  It  is \nestimated  that  since  1950,  the  wetland  area  has  shrunk  by  30%. \nMoreover, the area of natural wetlands has decreased, with the area of \nartificial  wetlands,  such  as  salt  and  aquaculture  ponds,  doubling. \nEffective  upstream  environmental  and  water  resources  management \n(i.e., reducing pollution loads, preserving river regimes, and effective \ncoastal zone management) is required to reduce further wetlands loss \nand degradation, and thereby ensure the preservation of the Jiaozhou \nBay environment.  \n \nJiaozhou City is one of the county-level cities under the administration \nof Qingdao municipality on the northwest coast of Jiaozhou Bay. In \n2007,  the  city  had  a  total  area  of  1,210  square  kilometers  and  a ", "iii \npopulation of 891,800. The population is estimated to be increasing at \nan average annual rate of 1.12%. Economic growth in the project area \nhas averaged about 20% per annum in real terms since 2004 (well \nabove  the  national  average)  and  this  rapid  growth  is  expected  to \ncontinue  in  the  intermediate  term.  Immediate  impacts  of  this  rapid \ndevelopment have included (i) an increase in the incidence of flooding \nin the expanding urban areas, (ii) a high rate of waterborne disease, \nand  (iii)  increasing  environmental  damage  in  Jiaozhou  Bay.  While \nflooding was relatively rare in the 1990s, it has subsequently increased \nto about once in every 3 years, with average damage valued in excess \nof CNY200 million per flood. As the economy continues to develop \nrapidly, the extent and value of this damage is expected to further \nincrease. The incidence of waterborne diseases, particularly stomach-\nrelated diseases, is estimated to be well above the national average \nand is expected to increase in the future if attention is not paid to \nwastewater collection and treatment and increased public awareness of \npersonal hygiene. In addition, the extent and quality of the wetlands in \nJiaozhou  Bay  has  seriously  deteriorated  over  recent  years  and  the \nannual rate of loss is currently estimated at about 0.9%. All of these \nfactors are having a serious impact on continued local development, \nand together contribute to a strong demand for remedial action.   \n  \nWhile Jiaozhou City has implemented various water conservation and \nmanagement projects, including notably the development of Shaohai \nLake (serving both as a flood retention zone and artificial wetland at the \nconfluence with the Dagu River) and the first phase of the centralized \nwastewater treatment facilities, there are still significant opportunities to \nimprove environmental management in relation to (i) the collection and \ninterception of industrial and domestic wastewater discharge directly \ninto  water  courses;  (ii)  the  expansion  and  enhancement  of  the \ncentralized treatment facilities to protect the Dagu River/Jiaozhou Bay \nwetlands;  (iii)  the  improvement  of  urban  rivers  and  storm-water \nnetworks in the old urban area; (iv) the development of an integrated \napproach to flood management, incorporating the different structural \nand nonstructural measures currently operated separately by different \nentities;  and  (v)  the  continuation  of  institutional  and  financial \nmanagement  reforms  to  facilitate  sustainable  environmental \nmanagement. The initial results and lessons learned from these efforts \nto improve environmental management will be a good model for other \ncounty governments in the PRC. \n   \nImpact and  The impact of the proposed Project will be improved quality of life, a \nOutcome  sustainable ecosystem, and biodiversity conservation in Jiaozhou Bay. \n \nThe project outcome will be improved condition of water resources and \nthe environment in Jiaozhou City and the downstream wetlands. \n   \nProject Investment  The  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $105.8  million, \nPlan   including taxes and duties of $3.1 million.  \n \nFinancing Plan  A loan of $45.0 million from the ordinary capital resources of the Asian \n ", "iv \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have \na 25-year term including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per annum on undisbursed funds, and \nsuch other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project \nagreements. \n   \nAmount \nSource  ($ million)  % \n \nAsian Development Bank  45.0  42.5 \nJiaozhou City Government  60.8  57.5 \nTotal  105.8  100.0 \n Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \nAllocation and  The Government of the PRC will relend funds to the Qingdao Municipal \nRelending Terms  Financial Bureau, which is under the QMG. The imprest fund account \nwill be set up in the Qingdao Municipal Financial Bureau. QMG will then \nonlend the loan proceeds to the Jiaozhou city government (JCG) with \nthe same loan terms and conditions. JCG will disburse the funds to the \ncontractors for the project implementation. In terms of loan repayment, \nJCG will pay QMG, and QMG will then repay the Ministry of Finance, \nwhich will in turn pay ADB. JCG will assume the foreign exchange and \ninterest rate variation risks of the ADB loan. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 September 2014 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 March 2014 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Jiaozhou city government \n   \nImplementation  A  project  leading  group  has  been  established,  headed  by  the  vice \nArrangements  mayor  of  JCG  and  comprising  representatives  from  Jiaozhou  City \nConstruction Bureau, City Development and Reform Bureau, Finance \nBureau, Environmental Protection Bureau, Planning Bureau, Shaohai \nArtificial  Lake  Management  Bureau,  Land  Resources  Bureau,  and \nWater Resources Bureau. The project leading group will provide overall \npolicy  guidance,  facilitate  interagency  coordination,  and  resolve  any \ninstitutional  problems  affecting  project  implementation.  A  project \nmanagement office (PMO) has been established, comprising 10 staff \nfrom  Jiaozhou  City  Construction  Bureau,  which  includes  the  project \nmanager  and  staff  for  undertaking  activities related  to  procurement, \ndisbursement, engineering, social and environmental safeguards, and \ninterpreting.     \n   \nProcurement  All procurement of goods and works shall be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime).  Contracts  for  goods  estimated  to  exceed  $1.0  million  and \ncontracts for works estimated to exceed $10.0 million shall be procured ", "v \nusing international competitive bidding procedures. Contracts for goods \nand works estimated to be equal to or less than the above international \ncompetitive bidding values but more than $100,000 shall be procured \nthrough national competitive bidding procedures in accordance with the \nPRC  Tendering  and  Bidding  Law  (1999),  subject  to  modifications \nagreed upon with ADB. Contracts for goods and works estimated to \ncost $100,000 or less shall be procured using shopping procedures. \nThe  relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date) will be included in all procurement documents and \ncontracts. \n   \nConsulting Services  About  31  person-months  of  international  and  100  person-months  of \nnational consulting services, to be funded under the Project, will be \nrequired  for  project  management  support  and  implementation  of \nnonstructural  measures.  Consulting  services  will  be  provided  in  the \nfollowing specific areas: (i) development of an integrated information \nsystem  for  management  of  drainage  and  wastewater  assets  in \nJiaozhou, (ii) ecological upgrading of the Shaohai Lake wetlands, (iii) \nconstruction supervision and quality control, (iv) financial management \nand  corporate  governance,  and  (v)  operation  and  maintenance \nimprovements. The international consultants will also provide training \nand  capacity  building  in  wastewater  management  and  treatment \nplanning, industrial pollution control, hydrological and hydraulic analysis, \nstorm-water source control, financial management, and environmental \nmonitoring  and  management.  Contracts  for  consulting  services \nestimated at $200,000 and above will be awarded to consulting firms \nusing  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedure  (80:20),  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time).  \n   \nProject Benefits  The  Project  will  directly  benefit  about  370,000  people  living  in  the \nand Beneficiaries  project area, of whom about 1.5% are poor, and indirectly benefit about \n3 million people in the Jiaozhou Bay area. All residents in Jiaozhou City \nwill  benefit,  as  their  living  conditions  will  improve  as  a  result  of  (i) \nreduced pollution of Jiaozhou Bay\u2019s surface water, with water quality \nimproving to at least class V by 2014, with longer-term potential to be \nupgraded to class IV; (ii) protection from flooding and elimination of \nhazards resulting from poor drainage; and (iii) 40% reduction in the \nincidence  of  waterborne  diseases  from  2008  levels,  with  a \ncorresponding decline in the number of sick days and expenses for \nmedical treatment. Residents in the broader Jiaozhou Bay area will also \nbenefit from (i) reduced pollution of Jiaozhou Bay, improved amenity \nvalues,  reduced  health  risks  from  the  consumption  of  shellfish  and \nreduced  algal  growths  in  the  bay  and  surrounding  areas;  and  (ii) \nimproved  urban  planning  through  the  raising  of  environmental \nsustainability at the early stages of project conception.   \nThe Project will create about 3,400 full-time jobs during construction, of \nwhich about 75% will be for the unemployed. To maximize the project \nbenefits, women will be given priority in the employment and training \nopportunities  generated  in  the  Project\u2019s  construction  and  operation \n ", "vi \nphases.  The  Project  will  generate  direct  economic  benefits  from \nimproved  flood  control  and  management,  improved  health,  and \nreductions in the extent of environmental degradation in the coastal \nwetlands from both the structural and nonstructural investments. For \nflood management, the annualized economic benefit in constant 2008 \nvalues is estimated at CNY90.8 million in 2011, increasing to CNY120.1 \nmillion in 2021; health benefits are expected to increase from CNY0.75 \nmillion in 2010 to CNY12.35 million in 2033; finally, the value of wetland \nbenefits  was  projected  to  increase  from  CNY0.04  million  (from  1.1 \nhectare [ha] saved) in 2011 to CNY6.97 million (from 196.1 ha saved) in \n2033. The overall project economic internal rate of return is 14.7%. The \nproject design is technically sound, economically efficient, affordable to \nbeneficiaries, and financially and economically viable. \nRisks and  Potential risks to the Project include (i) failure of the Government to \nAssumptions  implement  timely  extensions  and  enhancement  to  the  Jiaozhou \nwastewater treatment plant (WWTP), (ii) insufficient capacity to ensure \nthe proper operation and maintenance of project facilities, (iii) ineffective \norganizational  structures  and  inadequate  capacity  of  the  PMO,  (iv) \ndelays in the provision of counterpart funding, (v) failure of JCG to \nincrease wastewater tariffs to meet cost recovery targets, and (vi) delay \nin  implementation  of  the  proposed  SEA.  These  risks  have  been \nmitigated  by  (i)  obtaining  assurances  from  the  JCG  on  the  timely \nimplementation of the WWTP; (ii) capacity building for the PMO through \nthe Project; (iii) assurances from JCG on the provision of counterpart \nfunding, and regular tariff reviews and increases; and (iv) provision of a \ntechnical assistance (TA) grant by ADB to the Government.  \n \nThe  Project  does  not  have  any  unusual  technical  risks.  Standard \nengineering designs will be adopted for flood control and wastewater \nmanagement.  During  project  implementation,  consultants  will  help \nundertake proper survey and design prior to construction.   \n \nTechnical  An  advisory  TA  grant  of  $750,000  is  requested  to  strengthen  the \nAssistance  capacity of QMG in strategic environmental planning and management \nto  support  SEA  on  Jiaozhou  Bay  development.

Since the opening up of the PRC in 1978, spearheaded by the coastal provinces, the \nPRC  has  achieved  unprecedented  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  rates.  Over  this \nperiod, the rate of urbanization has increased from 17.9% in 1978 to 36% in 2000, and 40.5% in \n2005. Thus, the urban population has tripled over a period of 25 years, reaching a total of about \n500 million city dwellers by 2005. By 2030, the urban population is expected to reach about 870 \nmillion, representing around 60% of the total population. The increasing urban population is (i) \nfuelling further industrialization, economic development, and intensification of agriculture; (ii) \nstraining the already overloaded infrastructure; and (iii) contributing to widespread pollution and \nenvironmental threats to the PRC\u2019s rivers, lakes, and coastal waters. Urbanization pressures \nare particularly intense in the PRC\u2019s coastal provinces; various activities (settlements, ports, and \nindustrial facilities) are increasingly competing for land in the narrow coastal zones. Increasing \npollution loads, more frequent floods, and droughts (exacerbated by climate change and rising \nsea  levels)  impose  threats  to  sustainable  water  resources  management  in  these  coastal \nregions. A review of the sector is in Appendix 2.   \n \n3.  Combined with the declining availability of base flows, the river courses, streams, and \nlakes have seen a progressive increase in the quantity of wastewater discharged into them. The \ntotal volume of wastewater discharged in the PRC has been increasing since 1991, with about \n54 billion tons of wastewater discharged in 2006. The combined effects of overuse of water, \nwater pollution, and water-related developments are destroying aquatic ecosystems in the PRC. \nHowever, due to a lack of regular and systematic monitoring, it is difficult to quantify the effects. \nThe most vulnerable among these aquatic systems are lakes and wetlands because of their \nlower assimilative capacity and vulnerability due to the adverse effects of sudden changes. \n \n4.  The Government\u2019s plans to address water pollution have not kept pace with the rate of \neconomic growth. During the 10th Five-Year Plan (FYP, 2001\u20132005), environmental protection \nwas the only area of the plan that failed to fully achieve its targets, and as a result, eight of the \n20 environmental targets remained unattained. In particular, emissions of chemical oxygen \ndemand showed only a 2% decrease, compared with the planned 10% reduction. Treated \nsewage short of the envisaged target of 45% by about 8%. Only about 60% of the targets for \npollution control for the major rivers and lakes were accomplished; about 41% of the water in \nthe seven major river basins do not meet the class III national water quality standard and \nthereby is unacceptable as a source of drinking water. Marine ecosystems are also increasingly \nunder stress, with significant rises in the number of harmful algal blooms over the last few \ndecades; during the 10th FYP period, the number of harmful algal blooms increased to over 100 \nevents per year in coastal waters, from around 20 in previous years. The recent occurrence of \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Preparing the Qingdao Water Resources \nManagement Project. Manila.  ", "2   \nan algal bloom prior to the staging of the sailing regatta as part of the 29th Olympiad has \nsignificantly  raised  awareness  of  the  issue.  Several  factors  contributed  to  the  poor \nenvironmental  performance  during  the  10th  FYP,  the  most  significant  being  (i)  inadequate \nattention of local governments to environmental protection, (ii) high economic growth and rapid \nurbanization with low resource-use efficiency, (iii) weak regulatory supervision and enforcement, \n(iv)  weak  cross-sectoral  and  transboundary  coordination,  and  (v)  ineffective  financing \nmechanisms.  \n \n5.  As part of the 11th FYP (2006\u20132010), the Government has given priority to several \nenvironmental and natural resource concerns, which include (i) land degradation, (ii) water \nshortage and pollution, (iii) poor urban environmental infrastructure, (iv) degradation of marine \necosystems and wetlands, (v) increasing frequency and intensity of environmental accidents, \nand (vi) global environmental issues such as climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. \nThe Government issued a series of policy directives on environmental protection for the 11th \nFYP period. These policy directions are incorporated into the National Economic and Social \nDevelopment  Master  Plan  of  March  2006.  This  plan  gives  priority  to  (i)  protecting  and \nrehabilitating valued ecosystems, (ii) increasing efforts in pollution control, (iii) improving natural \nresources management, and (iv) sustainably utilizing marine/water resources. As a guiding \npolicy for the 11th FYP, the State Council directive sets forth two broad environmental objectives \nfor the next 5\u201315 years. By 2010, the environmental quality of key regions and cities will be \nimproved, and the trend of ecological degradation will be arrested. By 2020, the quality of the \nenvironment and the state of the country\u2019s ecosystems will have improved significantly. There \nare many other specific targets set under the 11th FYP, but the reduction in energy intensity by \n20% and total pollution load by 10% are the two most prominent. \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n6.  Most of the water management problems in the PRC, particularly for the coastal cities, \nare the result of a fragmented approach to development. There is a need to move towards a \nmore integrated management approach whereby the different responsibilities associated with \nwater management (water supply, wastewater management, and drainage) and ecosystem \nrehabilitation are managed together in close coordination with land-use planning, coastal zone \nmanagement and water resource management, and pollution control at the river basin level. To \nreduce pollution in the country\u2019s coastal waters and sustain ecosystems, a number of specific \nactions are needed, including (i) adopting a holistic approach to water management in river \nbasins and coastal zones; (ii) reducing land-based pollution sources, particularly industrial and \nurban sources; and (iii) continuing institutional and financial management reforms to facilitate \nsustainable environment management.   \n \n7.  The  coastal  wetlands  of  Jiaozhou  Bay,  surrounded  by  the  Qingdao  Municipality \n(including the city of Jiaozhou situated at the head of the bay), are vital, as they are the most \nimportant marine ecosystem of the Qingdao coastal region and the Shandong Peninsula. They \nprovide breeding grounds for many types of fish and shellfish, a resting place for migratory birds, \nas well as maintaining coastal biological diversity. In addition, they play a key role in absorbing \nexcessive nutrients from land-based activities, before the nutrients enter the waters of the bay \nproper, thereby helping to prevent eutrophication in the bay. The wetlands are also a key to \nflood management and coastal protection, which will become increasingly significant to coastal \ncities as sea levels continue to rise as a result of global warming. Since the 1950s, the coastal \nwetlands around Jiaozhou Bay have been severely affected by human activities, notably in \nrelation to excessive pollution generation. It is estimated that since the 1950s, the wetland area \nhas shrunk by 30%. As a result, the area of natural wetlands has decreased, while the artificial \nwetlands, such as salt and aquaculture ponds, have doubled in area. Whereas the water quality ", "  3\nconditions appear not to be eutrophic in the bay (with generally high levels of oxygen and low \nlevels of biomass), the frequency of algal blooms has been increasing and nutrient levels are \nconsidered to be sufficiently high to favor eutrophication should wetlands continue to degrade. \nThese  observations  indicate  that  effective  upstream  environmental  and  water  resources \nmanagement (reducing pollution loads and preserving river regimes) together with effective \ncoastal zone management zoning is required to reduce further wetlands loss and degradation, \nand thereby ensure the preservation of the Jiaozhou Bay environment.   \n \n8.  Jiaozhou  City,  one  of  the  county-level  cities  under  the  administration  of  Qingdao \nMunicipality, is on the northwest coast of Jiaozhou Bay. In 2007, the city had a total area of \n1,210  square  kilometers  and  a  population  of  891,800.  The  population  is  estimated  to  be \nincreasing at an average annual rate of 1.12%. Economic growth in the project area has \naveraged about 20% per annum in real terms over the since 2004, which is well above the \nnational  average,  and  this  rapid  growth  is  expected  to  continue  in  the  intermediate  term. \nImmediate impacts of this rapid development have included (i) an increase in the incidence of \nflooding in the expanding urban areas, (ii) a high rate of waterborne disease incidence, and (iii) \nincreasing environmental damage to Jiaozhou Bay. While flooding was relatively rare in the \n1990s, the incidence has subsequently increased to about once in every 3 years, with average \ndamage valued in excess of CNY200 million per flood. As the economy continues to develop \nrapidly, the extent and value of this damage is expected to further increase. The incidence of \nwaterborne diseases, particularly stomach-related diseases, is estimated to be well above the \nnational  average  and  is  expected  to  increase  in  the  future.  Its  attention  is  not  given  to \nwastewater collection and treatment and increased public awareness of personal hygiene. In \naddition, the extent and quality of the wetlands in Jiaozhou Bay has seriously deteriorated over \nrecent years and the annual rate of loss is currently estimated at about 0.9%. All of these factors \nare having a serious impact on continued local development and together contribute to a strong \ndemand for remedial action. A problem tree analysis is in Appendix 3. \n \n9.  In the past, too many water conservation programs in the PRC have failed due to the \ninability of county governments to raise adequate counterpart funds, or have been distorted due \nto the need to focus on activities that create short- and medium-term revenues. There is a need \nfor international financing institutions to fund those areas not supported by private funding \nsources. The wastewater treatment system is a good example where the establishment of \nsewerage networks is not attractive to private funding sources and is underfinanced by local \ngovernments. \n \n10.  While Jiaozhou City has implemented various water conservation and management \nprojects, including notably the development of Shaohai Lake (serving both as a flood retention \nzone and artificial wetland at the confluence with the Dagu River) and the first phase of the \ncentralized wastewater treatment facilities, there are still significant opportunities to improve \nenvironmental management in relation to (i) the collection and interception of industrial and \ndomestic wastewater discharge directly into water courses, (ii) the expansion and enhancement \nof the centralized treatment facilities to protect the Dagu River and Jiaozhou Bay wetlands, (iii) \nimprovement of rivers and storm-water networks in the old urban area, (iv) the development of \nan  integrated  approach  to  flood  management  incorporating  the  different  structural  and \nnonstructural measures currently operated separately by different entities, and (v) continuing \ninstitutional  and  financial  management  reforms  to  facilitate  sustainable  environmental \nmanagement.  The  initial  results  and  lessons  learned  from  these  efforts  to  improve \nenvironmental management will be a good model for other county governments in the PRC.  \n  \n ", "4   \n11.  The Qingdao municipal government (QMG) and the Jiaozhou city government (JCG) are \nrequesting the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) assistance to reduce flooding and pollution \nimpacts, and improve environmental management upstream from the Jiaozhou Bay wetlands. \nThis Project will serve as demonstration for further development of other districts around the bay \narea. This is particularly consistent with QMG\u2019s master plan for Jiaozhou Bay, which aims for \nbalanced development along the western and eastern parts of the bay. It also supports ADB\u2019s \nstrategic priority in the country partnership strategy (CPS),2 which aims to promote inclusive \ngrowth and environmental sustainability. \n \n12.  Government  Policies  and  Plans. The Government recognizes the urgent need to \naddress the prevailing pollution and water management issues of its marine ecosystems. In the \nwhite paper Environmental Protection in China3 , the Government of the PRC attached great \nimportance  to  the  appropriate  development  and  protection  of  marine  resources  and  the \nprevention of marine pollution and ecological damage to facilitate sustainable development. The \nGovernment is a signatory to the RAMSAR Convention4 on Wetlands, and has issued protection \norders  for  many  national  and  provincial  wetlands  including  the  Jiaozhou  Bay/Dagu  River \nwetlands. These actions are complemented by the issuance of legislation related to wetlands \nprotection  by  QMG,  proposing  definite  and  strict  requirements  for  wetland  protection.  The \ndevelopment  of  Shaohai  Lake  is  a  core  subproject  in  \u201cProject  of  wetlands  protection  and \nrestoration in Shandong Jiaozhou Bay Nature Reserves\u201d (Jiaozhou section) and an integral part \nof the \u201cShandong Province ecological construction planning\u201d.  \n13.  QMG  started  preparation  of  the  new  development  strategy  of  \u201cembracing  bay \ndevelopment, surrounding bay protection\u201d in March 2008. The strategy was to involve the whole \nJiaozhou Bay development and address the future population of an extra 3\u20133.5 million in 2020 \nin the Qingdao urban area. One of the key issues for the new planning is to focus on detailed \nplanning of several regions, including the Shaohai new area in Jiaozhou City. The features of \nthe new bay development will highlight environment protection, new technology development, \nand ecotourism. QMG is aware of the need for a comprehensive and integrated water resource \nand environmental management approach to address the complex and interrelated problems \nassociated  with  such  development.  It  is  for  this  purpose  that  QMG  is  seeking  effective \napproaches for managing its water resources and environment which, in turn, may serve as \nbasis for further development of other economic/industrial zones in the bay area.  \n  \n14.  ADB\u2019s  Country  Partnership  Strategy.  ADB\u2019s  CPS  emphasizes  inclusive  growth \nthrough balanced development and environmental sustainability. There will be increased focus \non  ecosystem  conservation,  and  increased  investment  in  natural  resources  management, \nagriculture, and rural development. The proposed Project supports ADB\u2019s strategic priorities. \nThe  Project  will  also  support  and  strengthen  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  and  initiatives  with \nQMG/JCG in several key areas including (i) nonstructural measures for flood management, (ii) \nintegrated approaches to river basin management and ecosystem restoration, (iii) wastewater \nand storm-water management, (iv) cost recovery and tariff reform for wastewater management, \n(v)  strengthening  corporate  governance  and  private  sector  participation,  and  (vi)  strategic \nenvironmental assessment (SEA).  \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2008.

", "  5\n15.  External Assistance. The Government of the PRC is an active participant in the Global \nProgramme for Action for the Marine Environment for land-based activities organized by the \nUnited Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), taking part in regional programs such as the \nNorth West Pacific Action Plan, the UNEP Global Environmental Facility (GEF) project on the \nSouth China Sea and the Gulf of Thailand, and the UNEP GEF Yellow Sea Marine Ecosystem \nProject.  To  gain  from  international  experience,  the  Government  has  entered  into  strategic \npartnerships with the GEF and other international partners to develop comprehensive resource \nmanagement  approaches  that  integrate  ecological,  economic,  and  social  dimensions  of \nbiodiversity management. ADB and other international agencies have provided a number of \ntechnical  assistance  and  loan  projects  to  assist  the  PRC  in  environmental  and  wetland \nprotection, flood management, and pollution control management (Appendix 4).    \n16.  Lessons. ADB\u2019s water supply and wastewater loan projects in the PRC have been \ngenerally  well  implemented.5 Lessons  from  previous  projects  in  the  Songhua  and  Nanjing \nQinghuai rivers, Sanjiang Plain, and Baiyangdian Lake were considered in policy dialogue with \nthe  Government,  engineering  designs  of  the  project  facilities,  and  capacity-development \nprograms. Lessons identified from ADB\u2019s post-evaluation experience in water infrastructure \nprojects  also  highlights  the  importance  of  nonstructural  measures:  (i)  encouraging  broad \nreforms, such as autonomous management, and introducing private sector participation for \nefficient  and  responsive  delivery  of  water  and  wastewater  services;  (ii)  appropriate  pricing \npolicies to encourage sustainable water and sanitation services; (iii) the use of management \ntools such as management and geographic information systems and performance grading to \nmore appropriately manage water service assets; and (iv) educating, consulting, and involving \nthe public in environmental improvement. In the project design, specific actions have been \ndefined to reinforce the nonstructural element of this Project, notably taking into account the \nfeasibility report recommendations.6  \n17.  Where projects have had difficulty, it has rarely been in the construction process itself \nbut rather in relation to (i) inadequate or late treatment of resettlement issues leading to serious \ndelays in construction start-up, (ii) inadequate or poor project design, (iii) inadequate knowledge \nof procurement procedures and complex procurement plans, and (iv) low proportion of civil \nworks financing resulting in loan savings and cancellation of surplus loan amounts. These \nissues have been reviewed in detail during project processing and the relevant lessons have \nbeen incorporated in the project design. A more detailed discussion of lessons learned is in \nSupplementary Appendix Q.  \n18.  Recent reviews7 on reviving Tai Lake, Baiyangdian Wetland, Sanjiang Plain Wetland, \nand West Lake have identified a series of features common to effective restoration of lakes and \nwetlands:  \n \n(i)  Strong  and  consistent  leadership  and  action.  Restoration takes time and \nresources often beyond the rather narrow focus of the typical FYP, and also \nrequires effective cross-sector and transjurisdictional coordination. Catchment \nboundaries are rarely the same as jurisdictional boundaries, and thus there is a \n                                                 \n5  In the project completion reports, the Dalian Water Supply Project was rated \"generally successful\"; the Anhui \nEnvironmental Improvement Project, Fuzhou Water Supply and Wastewater Treatment Project, and Suzhou Creek \nRehabilitation Project were all rated \"highly successful\". The project performance audit report for the Dalian Water \nSupply Project rated it \"highly successful\".  \n6  ADB. 2005.

Planning needs to integrate many sectors \nincluding land use, and should serve as a strategy that will be acceptable to all \nsectors  for  future  development.8 The  development  of  an  integrated  planning \nframework  has  often  led  to  particularly  notable  long-term  and  successful \npartnerships  between  the  PRC  and  the  major  development  agencies  and \ncommercial banks.  \n(iii)  Effective financial engineering. Too many programs have failed due to the \ninability of county governments to raise counterpart funds and focus spending on \nactivities that create short- and medium-term revenue-raising possibilities.9 There \nis a need for international financing institutions to fund those areas not supported \nby traditional and/or private funding sources. Domestic wastewater treatment \nsystems are a good example where one of the major deficiencies is with respect \nto the funding of networks which are not attractive to private funding sources.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n19.  The impact of the proposed Project is improved quality of life, a sustainable ecosystem, \nand  biodiversity  conservation  in  the  Jiaozhou  Bay  area.  The  project  outcome  is  improved \ncondition of water resources and environment in Jiaozhou City and the downstream wetlands.  \nB.  Outputs \n20.  The Project will adopt an integrated approach to address the current constraints in flood \nmanagement,  wastewater,  environmental  management,  and  ecosystem  conservation.  The \nproject outputs will comprise improved water resources and flood management, strengthened \nwastewater management and pollution control, integrated water and ecosystem management, \nand strengthened project management capacity. A detailed description of these components is \nprovided in Supplementary Appendixes A\u2013C. \n \n21.  Improved Water Resources and Flood Management. This component will help (i) \nundertake river dredging, embankment works, and greening over of a total length of 19.5 \nkilometers (km) for four river courses; (ii) upgrade the Erli\u2019he flood retention facilities; and (iii) \nconstruct 11.4 km of storm sewerage facilities in Jiaozhou City.   \n \n22.  Strengthened Wastewater Management and Pollution Control. This component will \nhelp (i) construct 15.9 km of interceptor sewer along river embankments in Jiaozhou City to \ncollect and transport sewerage to the existing wastewater trunk sewerage system; and (ii) \nsupplement the existing trunk sewerage system with an additional network of 11.8 km.  \n23.  To expand the wastewater treatment plant, a partnership with the private sector has \nbeen established. The expanded treatment capacity of 50,000 cubic meters (m3) per day will be \n                                                 \n8 The proposed strategic environmental assessment on the Jiaozhou Bay development, in parallel with the proposed \nProject, will strengthen QMG\u2019s integrated planning capabilities through streamlining environmental consideration \nand ecosystem conservation into its plan for further embracing Jiaozhou Bay. \n9 The Project is designed to use ADB financing to support the construction and upgrading of the storm-water and \nwastewater interceptor and sewerage system as well as the development of nonstructural measures which could \nnot directly generate revenue but are crucial to ensuring the sustainability of the water infrastructure investments. \nAt the same time, the private sector partnership to build a wastewater treatment plant has been established. ", "  7\nadded  to  the  existing  wastewater  treatment  plant  through  a  build-operate-transfer  (BOT) \ncontract between Jiaozhou authorities and a private company. As a result, the treatment level of \nthe plant will be enhanced from the existing class II10 to class IB, and will be adapted to treat \nlimited storm-water flows during high rainfall periods. The Project will provide safeguards due-\ndiligence support to the Jiaozhou authorities with respect to wastewater treatment process \ndesign and environmental assessment.  \n \n24.  Integrated Water and Ecosystem Management. This component will complement the \nstructural investments with a series of nonstructural measures to ensure effective utilization of \nthe new infrastructure and facilities. Activities are clustered into three key tasks, namely (i) \ncapacity building for flood and water resources management, (ii) environmental management \nand pollution control, and (iii) support for sustaining Shaohai artificial lake ecology.  \n \n25.  To enhance JCG\u2019s capacity in flood and water resources management, the Project will \nhelp  JCG  develop  an  integrated  information  system  for  flood,  water,  and  wastewater \nmanagement.  This  system  aims  to  gather  data  on  hydrology,  flood  facilities,  engineering, \ndrainage and wastewater collection network, and water quality information and integrate it into \none data system, rather than it being scattered across various line agencies, in order to promote \nholistic management. In addition to capacity building on the integrated information system, \ntraining on emergency response measures, flood zone mapping, storm-water control at source, \nand improved regulation for control structures will be provided under this component.  \n \n26.  The following activities have been designed to improve JCG\u2019s capacity in environmental \nmanagement and pollution control: (i) strengthening the participation of the local community and \nindustries in the environmental management and pollution control via training, workshops, and \nimproved compliance awareness; (ii) corporatization and strengthening of wastewater services \nin Jiaozhou City;11 (iii) wastewater tariff reform to ensure sustainable operations and to adopt a \npro-poor  approach;  and  (iv)  enforcement  of  the  environmental  monitoring  plan  under  the \nenvironmental management plan.  \n \n27.  To support the ecology of Shaohai Lake and its ecosystem management, the Project will \nconstruct artificial wetlands and enhance habitats to reduce nutrient loads into the lake. The \nmanagement of Shaohai Lake will be improved by strengthening capacity for monitoring of \nbiodiversity,  surface  water  flow,  water  quality,  and  other  ecosystem  parameters,  and \nestablishing a hydraulic and water quality simulation tool. Further details of this component are \nin Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n28.  The goal of protecting environmental conditions in Jiaozhou Bay and preserving wetland \nareas will be reinforced by strengthening both Qingdao\u2019s and Jiaozhou\u2019s integrated planning \ncapabilities through the preparation/formulation of an SEA aimed at providing guidance for \nsustainable environmental management to ensure \u201cQingdao embraces the bay\u201d (as described in \nparas. 56\u201358). \n \n29.   Strengthened Project Management Capacity. The existing project management office \n(PMO) of the Jiaozhou City Construction Bureau will be strengthened through staff training and \nthe provision of vehicles and equipment. Relevant staff from the PMO will receive training at the \n                                                 \n10  State  Environmental  Protection  Administration.  2006.

Beijing. \n11 This includes strengthening the institutional capacity of the intended wastewater service company, particularly for \nfinancial management, improved accountability, and increased transparency. The design of institutional capacity \ndevelopment will incorporate the best international practices for wastewater service companies.  \n ", "8   \nstart  of  the  Project  in  financial  management  and  reporting,  and  ADB  disbursement  and \nprocurement  procedures.  The  PMO  will  establish  and  maintain  a  project  performance \nmanagement system (PPMS) to monitor project implementation and performance in meeting \nproject targets. An international project implementation specialist will be recruited to provide \ntechnical advice to the PMO in technical design review, procurement, and project supervision. \nInternational and national experts in the following disciplines will also be provided to support \nproject management: (i) procurement; (ii) hydraulic, structural, and wastewater engineering; (iii) \nproject  monitoring  and  evaluation;  (iv)  resettlement  supervision;  and  (v)  environmental \nmonitoring. The terms of reference for consultants are in Supplementary Appendix D. \nC.  Special Features \n30.  Strategic  Environmental  Assessment.  The  proposed  SEA  on  the  Jiaozhou  Bay \ndevelopment, in parallel with the proposed Project in Jiaozhou City, will enable the initial results \nand lessons learned from the Jiaozhou project development to be incorporated into improved \nenvironmental planning over the whole bay area. The SEA will reinforce the institutional set-up \nby encouraging the development of a bay-wide environmental protection authority from the \nexisting leading group structure, and thereby contribute significantly to the coordination and \nintegration of the existing fragmented pollution control and water resources planning with urban \ndevelopment and marine ecosystem planning. The development of the SEA as a statutory \nplanning document guiding future detailed planning, and the implementation will reinforce the \nproject  outcome,  enabling  the  Project  to  be  replicated  throughout  the  bay  area,  thereby \nsignificantly enhancing the project impact.   \n  \n31.  Integrated Water and Ecosystem Management. Increased wastewater collection from \nabout 55% to over 80% will significantly reduce the pollution loads currently discharged to \nJiaozhou\u2019s rivers and Shaohai Lake. As a result, the risk of increasing eutrophication of the lake \ncan be mitigated. However, to reduce and further improve the existing conditions, a number of \nin situ measures involving the development of wetland areas at the point of entry of the rivers to \nthe  lakes  have  been  developed,  together  with  studies  to  monitor  and  further  investigate \nimprovements to water quality in the lake.  \n32.  The Project will complement the structural measures with the designed nonstructural \nmeasures,  which  were  well  accepted  by  the  Government. During  project  design,  hydraulic \nsimulation  techniques  were  developed  to  diagnose  current  flooding  behavior  and  test  the \nadequacy of proposed structural measures. These simulation approaches will be continued \nduring project implementation to develop operational rules to cater for events rarer than the \ndesign  events  through  flood  mapping  and  emergency  warning  systems,  and  test  the \neffectiveness of storm-water source control. In addition to these measures, the Project will \ncontribute to the corporatization of wastewater services and strengthening of tariff reform. An \nintegrated information system for flood, water, and wastewater management will be developed \nand operated during the project implementation.  \n33.  Public\u2013Private  Partnership.  Due to the underdevelopment of the sewage network, \ninadequate wastewater is being captured for the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). In this \nProject, ADB financing will support the construction and upgrading of the storm-water and \nwastewater interceptor and sewerage system as well as the development of nonstructural \nmeasures,  which  may  not  directly  generate  revenues  but  are  crucial  to  ensuring  the \nsustainability  of  the  water  infrastructure  investments.  In  addition,  to  expand  the  WWTP,  a \npartnership with the private sector has been established. An expanded treatment capacity of \n50,000 m3/day will be added to the existing WWTP through a BOT contract between the \nJiaozhou authorities and a private company. The Project will (i) provide safeguards and due-", "  9\ndiligence support to Jiaozhou authorities with respect to wastewater treatment process design \nand environmental assessment, and (ii) promote wastewater tariff reform in Jiaozhou City.  \n \n34.  This WWTP will be constructed and operated under a 20-year BOT arrangement by the \nZhongkecheng Environmental Company using the A2O12 treatment process. The agreement \nwith the Zhongkecheng Environmental Company has been signed. The WWTP is expected to \nbe operational by the end of 2009. In addition to being responsible for the operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) of the ADB-financed project, the public utility division under the Jiaozhou \nConstruction  Bureau  will  also  be  responsible  for  the  supervision  and  management  of  the \nproposed WWTP.  \n \n35.  Optimization of Design. Significant design optimizations were undertaken to improve \nboth the efficiency of the overall Project and to reduce resettlement and associated social \ndisruptions. The Erli\u2019he Reservoir subcomponent investment was significantly reduced while \npreserving its overall function and reducing significantly the amount of resettlement and land \nacquisition required. Initially, it was proposed to separate the sewerage system in the older \nparts of Jiaozhou, thereby creating two sewerage systems. Experience has shown that this \nsolution is both costly and difficult to achieve in practice. As a result, an alternative solution \nbased  on  the  use  of  an  interceptor  system  (associated  with  separation  of  the  secondary \nsewerage)  has  been  developed,  enabling  reduction  in  both  investment  costs  and  social \ndisruption.  \n \n36.  Pollution  Control  Enforcement. A major percentage of industries in Jiaozhou are \nconnected to the exiting sewerage system, parts of which discharge directly to water courses. \nConnection of these sewerage systems to the centralized wastewater treatment facilities can \ncreate risks in relation to the efficiency of the treatment process without industrial wastewater \npre-treatment. The Project will consider these risks and strengthen pollution control enforcement \nby  implementing  the  following  activities:  (i)  strengthen  the  enforcement  capacity13 of  local \nenvironmental protection bureaus (EPBs) through the proposed SEA, (ii) train the wastewater \nentity to undertake effective monitoring of these industries, (iii) establish a community-based \nmonitoring  team  to  help  promote  compliance,  and  (iv)  design  an  appropriate  industrial \nwastewater tariff (as part of the wastewater tariff reform) based upon pollution loads rather than \nsimply water use. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n37.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $105.8 million equivalent, including taxes \nand duties ($3.1 million), contingencies ($17.7 million), and interest and other charges ($5.8 \nmillion). A summary of cost estimates is shown in Table 1 and details are provided in Appendix \n5. \n                                                 \n12  Anaerobic/anoxic/oxic (A2O) is a process to treat domestic wastewater. The A2O process is proven to be effective \nin removing the nitrogen and phosphorus in the wastewater, which are key contributors to the eutrophication of \nlakes and wetlands.    \n13\nBoth the Qingdao EPB and Jiaozhou EPB have established environmental inspection offices which are responsible \nfor checking the level of compliance by enterprises with pollution standards, permits, and payment of charges. \nPrivate enterprises are inspected by Jiaozhou EPB. State-owned enterprises which are assigned a special \nadministrative status are inspected by Qingdao EPB. When noncompliance is established, inspectors can issue \nwarning letters, impose fines, or withdraw the permit for a part of or the whole installation. Compliance schedules \n(called \u201cpollution control within deadlines\u201d) are also frequently used. In August 2007, Jiaozhou EPB carried out a \nthorough inspection of 42 key polluting enterprises across seven sectors, and required these enterprises to reduce \ntheir pollution discharges to acceptable levels by June 2008.   \n \n ", "10  \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n \nItem    Amount a \nA.

The Government has requested a loan of $45.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% on undisbursed \nfunds, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the loan agreements. The Government \nhas provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these \nchoices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or \nadvice from ADB. The financing plan is in Table 2.

The ADB loan will finance 42.5% of the total project costs. The remaining costs will be \nfinanced by JCG covering base costs, financing charges during implementation, and physical \nand price contingencies. The local costs of JCG will be financed from land-use fees and urban \nconstruction  and  maintenance  taxes.  JCG  has  issued  a  commitment  letter  confirming  the \navailability of counterpart funds.14   \n40.  Loan Funds Flow. The Qingdao Municipality is one of the few special cases in the PRC \nthat report directly to the central Government in terms of fiscal revenues and outlays. Therefore, \nin terms of loan disbursement, ADB loan proceeds will be disbursed directly from the Ministry of \nFinance to the QMG. The imprest fund account will be set up in the Qingdao Financial Bureau, \nwhich has prior experience in dealing with loans from international institutions such as the World \nBank, Japan Bank for International Cooperation, and ADB. QMG will then onlend the loan \nproceeds to JCG with the same loan terms and conditions. JCG will disburse the loan funds to \nthe contractors for project implementation. In terms of loan repayment, JCG will pay QMG, \nQMG will repay the Ministry of Finance, which will then repay ADB. JCG will assume the foreign \nexchange and interest rate variation risks of the ADB loan. The flow of funds and onlending \narrangements are in Appendix 6. \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n41.  The Executing Agency (EA) for the Project is JCG. A project leading group has been \nestablished, headed by the vice mayor of JCG and comprising representatives from Jiaozhou \nCity  Construction  Bureau,  City  Development  and  Reform  Bureau,  Finance  Bureau, \nEnvironmental  Protection  Bureau,  Planning  Bureau,  Shaohai  Artificial  Lake  Management \nBureau, Land Resources Bureau, and Water Resources Bureau. The leading group will provide \noverall  policy  guidance,  facilitate  interagency  coordination,  and  resolve  any  institutional \nproblems affecting project implementation. A PMO has been established, comprising 10 staff \nfrom  Jiaozhou  City  Construction  Bureau,  which  include  the  project  manager  and  staff  for \nundertaking  activities  related  to  procurement,  disbursement,  engineering,  social  and \nenvironmental safeguards, and interpreting.   \n \n42.  During project implementation, the PMO will be responsible for coordinating with the \ndesign institutes, specialists, and contractors procured under the Project. Upon completion of \nthe Project, the Public Utility Division of the Jiaozhou Construction Bureau will be responsible \nfor the O&M of the completed facilities including wastewater networks, drainage, river courses \nmanagement, and supervision and management of the WWTP, which will be built by the private \nsector through the BOT modality.  \n                                                 \n14 Land acquisition and resettlement costs are estimated at about CNY2.8 million, and will be financed by local \ncounterpart funds. \n ", "12  \n43.  The capacities of water-related agencies in Qingdao and Jiaozhou were assessed. It \nwas concluded that there is a need for assistance to strengthen water resources management \nand conservation, such as (i) the introduction of an integrated information system, which will \napply real-time data acquisition, geographic information system platform, river courses and \ndrainage/sewer system simulation software, and a decision support system for real-time flood \nmanagement; (ii) training for the corporatization of wastewater services; and (iii) planning for \nwastewater tariff reform. The detailed analysis are provided in Appendix 3 and Supplementary \nAppendixes C\u2013L.   \n44.  The PMO\u2019s financial, technical, and institutional capacity was assessed. Based on the \nassessment, the Jiaozhou PMO will need training in relevant ADB procedures during project \nimplementation. The detailed discussion is in Supplementary Appendix L.  \n2.  Implementation Period \n45.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years  from  April  2009  to March  2014.  An \nimplementation schedule is presented in Appendix 7. The implementation period is estimated \nbased on the project scope and construction technology requirements and ADB\u2019s successful \nexperience with similar projects in the PRC, combined with the knowledge and experience of \nJCG/QMG  and  the  PMO  in  wastewater  management  and  other  urban  environmental \nimprovement projects. The implementation schedule is realistic and achievable. \n3.  Procurement \n46.  All procurement of goods and works shall be carried out in accordance with ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Contracts for goods estimated \nto exceed $1.0 million and contracts for works estimated to exceed $10.0 million shall be \nprocured using international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures. Contracts for goods and \nworks estimated to be equal to or less than the above ICB values but more than $100,000 shall \nbe  procured  through  national  competitive  bidding  procedures  in  accordance  with  the  PRC \nTendering and Bidding Law (1999), subject to modifications agreed to with ADB. Contracts for \ngoods  and  works  estimated  to  cost  $100,000  or  less  shall  be  procured  using  shopping \nprocedures. A procurement plan setting out the indicative list of all procurement packages and \nthe  procurement  methods  is  provided  in  Appendix  8.  The  relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) will be included in all procurement documents \nand contracts. \n4.  Consulting Services \n47.  The Project will finance about 31 person-months of international and 100 person-months \nof  national  consulting  services  (to  be  funded)  for  project  management  support  and \nimplementation of nonstructural measures. Consulting services will be provided in the following \nspecific areas: (i) development of an integrated information system for management of drainage \nand wastewater assets in Jiaozhou City, (ii) ecological upgrading of the Shaohai Lake wetlands, \n(iii)  construction  supervision  and  quality  control,  (iv)  financial  management  and  corporate \ngovernance, and (v) O&M. The international consultants will specifically provide training and \ncapacity building in wastewater management and treatment planning, industrial pollution control, \nhydrological and hydraulic analysis, storm-water source control financial management, and \nenvironmental  monitoring  and  management.  Contracts  for  consulting  services  estimated  at \n$200,000  and  above will  be  awarded  to consulting  firms  using  the  quality-and  cost-based \nselection procedures (80:20), in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants ", " 13\n(2007, as amended from time to time). The consultant\u2019s terms of reference are provided in \nSupplementary Appendix D. \n5.  Advance Procurement and Retroactive Financing \n48.  JCG has requested for advance contracting and retroactive financing to enable early \ncommencement of procurement of goods and services including consultant services, training, \ndesign, preliminary construction, and small equipment procurement for river courses (i.e., Erli\u2019he \nRiver and Sanlihe) rehabilitation due to the deterioration of downstream wetlands. The details of \nactivities to be financed will be set out in a written request to ADB. ADB has advised the \nGovernment that retroactive financing could only apply up to 20% of the ADB loan in respect for \nexpenditures incurred not earlier than 12 months before the signing of the loan agreement. All \ncontracts for advance action will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  and  Procurement  Guidelines.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that \napproval of the advance action and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to financing the \nProject.  \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n49.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with QMG, JCG, and the \nPMO. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt, \nfraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the \nbidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with \nthe Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records \nand accounts of JCG, the PMO, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service \nproviders as they relate to the Project. The project design and implementation arrangements \nprovide for mitigating corruption risks. Risks associated with project management, including \nprocurement and disbursement, will be mitigated by (i) engaging an international consultant and \na national consultant to advise and assist in the procurement of goods and services, and the \nengagement of other consultants; (ii) introducing a dual signing system in which the civil works \ncontractor awarded the contract will also sign an anticorruption contract with the employer; and \n(iii) periodical inspection by the PMO of the contractor\u2019s activities related to fund withdrawals \nand settlements. In furtherance of the principles of transparency and accountability, JCG will \ncause the PMO to set and develop a project website that describes the Project in order to \nprovide the public with information on the Project, including (i) a summary of the audited \nfinancial statements of the Project, and (ii) tracking of contract awards in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines.  JCG  will  ensure  that  the  PMO  establishes  financial  control  and \nmanagement arrangements compatible with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial Management \nand Analysis of Projects and Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n50.  The  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook. Since many of the payments will be made for large contracts, direct \npayment, reimbursement, and commitment procedures will be used to withdraw funds from the \nloan account. To expedite the flow of funds and simplify document processing, the statement of \nexpenditure  procedure  may  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures  for  any  individual \npayment not exceeding $100,000. Payments exceeding this ceiling will be reimbursed based on \nthe full documentation process.  \n ", "14  \n51.  A  project  imprest  account  will  be  set  up  by  the  Qingdao  Financial  Bureau  in  a \ncommercial bank acceptable to ADB. Disbursements from the imprest account will be supported \nby an appropriate withdrawal application and required documentation. The initial amounts to be \ndeposited to the imprest account shall not exceed the estimated expenditures for the following 6 \nmonths or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower, to be financed from the imprest account. \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n52.  The PMO will maintain records and accounts that identify goods and services from loan \nproceeds, financing resources received, expenditures incurred, and use of local funds. These \naccounts will be established and maintained in accordance with sound accounting principles \nand internationally accepted accounting standards. The PMO will review and consolidate these \naccounts and have them audited annually in accordance with sound accounting practices by the \nsovereign audit agency of the Government or other auditors acceptable to ADB. The audit \nreport will include a statement verifying whether or not the funds disbursed by ADB were used \nfor the purposes for which they were provided, as well as the auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the \nimprest account and statement of expenditures procedures. Copies of the audited accounts and \nauditor\u2019s report will be submitted to ADB within 6 months after the end of each financial year. \nThe  PMO  will  prepare  consolidated  quarterly  reports  indicating  progress  made,  problems \nencountered during the period, steps taken or proposed to remedy the problems, proposed \nprogram of activities, and progress expected for the next quarter. Within 3 months of physical \ncompletion of the Project, the PMO will submit to ADB a completion report that describes the \nachievements in relation to the Project\u2019s expected impact, outcome, and outputs.  \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n53.  To monitor the progress of the Project in achieving the planned outcome and outputs, \nthe PMO will establish and maintain a project performance monitoring system (PPMS), which \nwill be designed to permit adequate flexibility to adopt remedial action regarding project design, \nschedules, activities, and development impacts. The PPMS will adopt the following agreed \nindicators:  (i)  physical  progress  of  subproject  implementation;  (ii)  results  of  the  capacity-\ndevelopment program; (iii) water quality and quantity improvements in the rivers and Shaohai \nLake, Dagu River, and Jiaozhou Bay; (iv) improvement in biodiversity conservation in Shaohai \nLake and Jiaozhou Bay; and (v) social development. At project inception, the PMO will develop \ncomprehensive PPMS procedures to systematically generate data on inputs and outputs of the \nproject  activities,  and  the  socioeconomic,  health,  and  environmental  indicators  to  measure \nproject impacts.  \n54.  The PMO will refine the PPMS framework, confirm achievable targets and monitoring \nand recording arrangements, and establish systems and procedures no later than 6 months \nafter project implementation begins. Baseline and progress data will be reported at the requisite \ntime intervals by the PMO, including annual reporting on the environmental management plan. \nThe  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  analyzing  and  consolidating  reported  data  through  its \nmanagement  information  system,  and  for  reporting  outcomes  to  ADB  and  QMG  through \nquarterly progress reports.  \n10.  Project Review \n55.  In addition to regular monitoring, project performance will be reviewed at least once a \nyear jointly by ADB and the Government. The review will assess implementation performance \nand achievement of progress towards project outcomes and outputs, financial progress, and \nissues and constraints affecting implementation, and work out a time-bound action plan for their ", " 15\nresolution. ADB and the Government will undertake a midterm review to assess implementation \nstatus and take appropriate measures, including modification of scope and implementation \narrangements,  and  reallocation  of  loan  proceeds,  as  appropriate,  to  achieve  the  Project\u2019s \nexpected outcomes and impact.  \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n56.  An advisory TA grant of $750,00015 is requested to strengthen the capacity of QMG in \nintegrated environmental planning and management to support the SEA on the Jiaozhou Bay \ndevelopment. QMG, through the Qingdao Environmental Protection Bureau as the Executing \nAgency (EA), will provide $250,000 for in-kind costs. The TA will address three priority issues \nidentified by the sector analysis and the lessons learned from previous interventions that need \nto  be  improved  in  the  implementation  of  an  ecosystem-based  integrated  water  resources \nmanagement  scheme:  (i)  integrated  planning  and  analysis,  (ii)  an  effective  management \nscheme, and (iii) an appropriate mechanism to monitor and ensure effective implementation. \n57.  The  advisory  TA  comprises  three  components  to  support  the  SEA:  (i)  support  the \ncreation  of  an  effective  management  mechanism  for  strategic  environmental  and  planning \nprocesses, (ii) the SEA of Jiaozhou Bay\u2019s further development for integrated planning, and (iii) \noperational guidelines and a monitoring system for implementation. \n \n58.  An  international  firm  will  be  engaged  through  the  quality-  and-cost-based  selection \nmethod (80:20) using simplified technical proposals in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants. Fifteen person-months of international and 60 person-months of national \nconsulting  services  will  be  required.  The  indicative  consultant  needs  and  outline  terms  of \nreference are provided in Appendix 9. Implementation of the TA will commence in the first year \nof the Project (2009).  \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Project Benefits and Impacts \n59.  The Project will benefit directly about 370,000 people living in the project area, of whom \nabout 1.5% are poor, and indirectly benefit about 3 million people in the Jiaozhou Bay area. All \nthe residents in Jiaozhou City will benefit and their living conditions will improve as a result of (i) \nreduced pollution of Jiaozhou\u2019s surface water, with water quality improving to at least class V by \n2014, with longer-term potential to be upgraded to class IV; (ii) protection from flooding and \nelimination of hazards resulting from poor drainage; and (iii) 40% reduction in the incidence of \nwaterborne diseases from 2008 levels, with a corresponding decline in the number of sick days \nand expenses for medical treatment. Approximately 3 million residents in the broader Jiaozhou \nBay area will benefit from (i) reduced pollution of Jiaozhou Bay, improved amenity values, \nreduced health risks from the consumption of shellfish, and reduced algal growths in the bay \nand surrounding areas; and (ii) improved urban planning through the raising of environmental \nsustainability in the early stages of project conception.  \nB.  Financial Analysis  \n60.  The Project is considered financially viable and sustainable. The Government does not \ncharge  beneficiaries  directly  for  its  flood  protection  services  and  other  project-related \nenvironmental services. The interventions will not directly generate any revenues. Therefore, \n                                                 \n15 About $400,000 will be cofinanced from the Water Financing Partnership Facility.   \n ", "16  \nthe project financial analysis only focuses on three aspects: (i) funds flow and Jiaozhou City\u2019s \nfiscal capacity, (ii) the financial management capacity of the EA and the PMO, and (iii) the \nProject\u2019s cost recovery and financial sustainability. These are discussed in detail in Appendix 10 \nand Supplementary Appendix J. \n61.  Jiaozhou City\u2019s Fiscal Capacity. Jiaozhou has adequate experience in servicing loans \nfrom international financial institutions such as the World Bank and ADB. The Jiaozhou revenue \nsituation indicates that adequate funds are available for the project counterpart contribution and \ndebt servicing. The major source where such funds can be drawn from is the land-use fees and \nurban  construction  and  maintenance  taxes,  which  are  estimated  at  an  annual  average  of \nCNY655 million, and have been stable in the past.  \n62.  According to the projection of fiscal status of Jiaozhou City by 2020, the total debt \nservice  will  be  about  3%  of  the  city\u2019s  total  fiscal  revenue  in  the  first  year  of  the  project \nimplementation in 2009, decreasing to about 2% in 2014, the last year of implementation. As a \npercentage of annual GDP, total  debt service is estimated at about 0.2% in 2009 and is \nprojected to decrease to about 0.1% in 2013. Total counterpart funds and debt service as a \npercentage of total potential sources of funds range from 13% to 15% during 2009\u20132014, the \nperiod of project implementation. This is projected to decrease to about 5% and even 4% \nthereafter. As debt service accounts for only a small proportion, it is safe to indicate that JCG \nwill more than adequately cover the required repayments under the loan. \n63.  Project  Financial  Management  Assessment.  Financial  management  assessment \n(FMA)  has  been  undertaken  to  determine  the  institutional  capacity  of  each  implementing \nagency, funds flow arrangements, staffing, accounting policies and procedures, internal and \nexternal auditing arrangements, reporting and monitoring aspects, and information system. JCG \nis the EA of the proposed Project. A PMO was set up within the EA in May 2008. An FMA \nquestionnaire was adapted to the subprojects\u2019 conditions. Issues or risks associated with the \nfinancial  management  systems  were  identified  and  the  most  appropriate  risk  mitigation \nmeasures  were  determined  as  part  of  project  design  and/or  project  implementation \narrangements.   \n64.  The  results  of  the  FMA  questionnaire  were  analyzed,  with  particular  focus  on  the \naccounting and auditing procedures and staff expertise. In terms of accounting and auditing \nprocedures, the existing financial information system (i.e., accounting, reporting, and internal \ncontrol system) is complete and applicable for domestic construction entities. In terms of staff \nexpertise,  the  PMO  under  the  Jiaozhou  Construction  Bureau  has  broad  experience  in \ninfrastructure construction financed by domestic funds, but has not implemented any ADB \nprojects. Training on ADB procedures and advanced financial management will be necessary to \nensure success of implementation of the proposed Project. \n65.  Project  Financial  Sustainability  Analysis.  Project  financial  sustainability  was \nconducted by comparing the O&M costs of each project component with their financing sources. \nSuch analysis was done separately for the flood management component and environmental \nmanagement  components  under  the  Project.  Under  the  environmental  components, \nconsideration was given not only to the O&M of the wastewater collection and treatment but \nalso the O&M of the downstream wetlands. \n66.   In terms of financial sustainability of the flood management component, the incremental \nannual O&M cost is CNY4.32 million per year, which is to be financed through a flood control \nmanagement fee. Analysis shows that by 2020, the flood management fee could reach CNY178 \nmillion per year, providing sufficient funds for the flood management O&M. In order to assess ", " 17\nthe financial sustainability of the wastewater network subcomponent, the existing wastewater \ncollection and treatment facilities were examined. Analysis shows that the annual O&M costs \nare about CNY16 million for the WWTP. JCG will pay the WWTP about CNY18 million per \nannum at a BOT price for wastewater treatment services. Therefore, the WWTP has adequate \nrevenue to cover the O&M costs of wastewater treatment. The Government collects wastewater \ntreatment fees from households, institutions, and industries at different rates. Tariff analysis \nshows that current tariffs are lower than the BOT price, resulting in a fiscal subsidy of around \nCNY2 million per year for wastewater treatment. The subsidy comes from the Government\u2019s \ngeneral budget, especially from the urban construction and maintenance tax, which is around \nCNY46 million per annum. In the long run, it is advisable for the Government to increase the \nwastewater treatment fees in order to reduce such subsidies, but in the short- and medium- \nterm the Government has sufficient resources to cover the O&M. The annual O&M costs of \nwastewater network are CNY2.3 million and of the pumping stations CNY0.5 million, and these \nare generally financed by the fiscal budgets. \n67.  Analysis shows that a tariff level of CNY1.35/m3 (as compared to the current tariff of an \naverage of CNY0.88/m3) would allow the wastewater treatment work to be self-financed, and \neven  show  a  small  profit.  A  willingness-to-pay  survey  and  an  affordability  analysis  were \nconducted to assess households\u2019 acceptance of potential tariff increases in the future. Ninety \npercent of the interviewees, except the extreme poor, find the current water tariff acceptable. \nOther  things  being  equal,  an  increase  of  the  wastewater  treatment  fee  from  the  current \nCNY0.88/m3 to CNY1.35/m3 would increase the total water expenditure as a percentage of \nhousehold total income from 0.6% in 2008 to 0.75% in 2013. JCG has submitted to ADB a \nwastewater reform plan which aims to gradually increase the wastewater tariff to CNY1.40/m3 \nby 2014. The economic analysis is in Appendix 11.  \nC.  Economic Benefits \n68.  The economic analysis provides a rationale and justification for the Project based on \npolicy and sector analysis. It considers the Project directly contributing to pollution reduction and \nflood control. These will in turn decrease health costs and increase the overall quality of urban \nlife. The economic analysis includes the rationale for the Project through demand analysis, the \nselection  of  the  optimal  design  through  least-cost  analysis  design  of  the  plan,  and  the \ndetermination of economic benefits.  \n69.  The Project will generate direct economic benefits from improved flood control and \nmanagement, improved health, and reductions in the extent of environmental degradation in the \ncoastal  wetlands  from  both  the  structural  and  nonstructural  investments.  Currently,  in  the \nwithout-project  situation,  Jiaozhou  experiences  frequent  flood  damage  caused  by  severe \nsiltation and poor flood-discharge capability of the Yunxi and Hucheng rivers. This mainly affects \nindustrial/commercial and private properties within the city proper, and from various Jiaozhou \ndocuments, it is estimated to occur once every 3 years. Based on these data, the 2001 flood, \nwhich caused CNY298 million of damage, was estimated to represent the 30-year flood return \nperiod. An estimate of the impact of the 50-year flood return period was obtained from the flood \nsimulation model.16 With this information, the annualized economic benefit, in constant 2008 \nvalues, was estimated at CNY90.8 million in 2011, increasing to CNY120.1 million in 2021.  \n70.  Economic benefits from reduced disease incidence were estimated based on statistical \ndata from JCG and information collected in the socioeconomic survey. The main diseases \n                                                 \n16 The flood simulation model was developed specifically for this Project, This represents a special feature as \ndiscussed previously. See Supplementary Appendix G. \n ", "18  \nincluded in the analysis are diarrhea, dysentery, gastroenteritis, and hepatitis A. Due to lack of \ndata, stomach and intestinal cancers and pollution-related diseases were excluded. Without the \nProject, the incidence of stomach-related illnesses was projected to increase from about 11,400 \nin 2009 to 50,200 in 2033. A 40% reduction in these diseases is expected following project \ncompletion,  and  the  benefits  are  expected  for  both  urban  and  rural  populations.  With  an \neconomic cost of these diseases valued at CNY613.80 per person per year, the health benefits \nare expected to increase from CNY0.75 million in 2010 to about CNY12.35 million in 2033. \n71.  The  premise  underlying  the  estimation  of  benefits  derived  from  strengthened  water \nresources and environmental management is that pollution will be effectively regulated and \ncontrolled, thereby significantly reducing wetland degradation. In addition, implementation of the \nSEA for Jiaozhou Bay is expected to have a significant longer-term impact on the wetlands as it \nincreases awareness of degradation and provides a legal basis for further preservation and \npollution control in the bay as a whole. Direct and quantifiable environmental benefits are \nidentified as both direct uses (food production, raw materials, recreation, and cultural) and \nindirect uses (disturbance regulation, nutrient cycling, biological control, and habitat and refuge). \nOf these, the main benefit is through nutrient cycling, for which direct estimate of the benefit was \nmade based on the cost of treating the total amount of wastewater currently produced to \nremove nitrogen and phosphorus, since this is the major source of pollution in the bay proper. \nThis was expressed in terms of the cost per hectare (ha) of wetlands. The value of wetland \nbenefits  was  projected  to  increase  from  CNY0.04  million  (from  1.1  ha  saved)  in  2011  to \nCNY6.97 million (from 196.1 ha saved) in 2033. \n72.  The project economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated at 14.7%. The result \nindicates that the Project as a whole is economically viable. Sensitivity analysis shows that the \nproject EIRR will fall (i) to 13.0% if economic benefits fall by 10%, (ii) to 13.3% if investment \ncosts increase by 10%, (iii) to 12.6% if commissioning is delayed for 1 year and 11.1% if \ndelayed for 2 years, and (iv) to 11.7% if (i) and (ii) occur together. Sensitivity analysis is also \ntested for each benefit and indicated that flood benefits had the greatest impact on economic \nviability. Sensitivity tests indicate that the returns to the overall Project are generally robust. The \neconomic analysis is in Appendix 11. Detailed economic analysis is presented in Supplementary \nAppendix K. \nD.  Environmental Benefits and Impacts \n73.  The Project is classified as category B in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy \n(2002). An environmental assessment for the Project has been carried out in accordance with \nthe PRC regulatory framework and ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines. The analysis \nindicates that the Project will bring significant environmental improvements for the Jiaozhou \nurban area, the downstream Shaohai Lake, and the parts of the wetlands of the Jiaozhou Bay. \nThese include better public health in Jiaozhou City, improved water quality of urban rivers, and \nreduced pollution loads in the downstream Shaohai Lake and Jiaozhou Bay wetlands. The \nproposed SEA will enable QMG to introduce sustainable approaches to urban development, \nthus protecting and maintaining the functions of the coastal wetlands and ecosystems.  \n \n74.  Potential  negative  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the  Project  have  been \nidentified, and adequate mitigation and monitoring arrangements have been incorporated in the \nenvironmental management plan (EMP). Potential adverse impacts during the construction and \noperation phase include unsafe disposal of dredged sediments and WWTP sludge, and limited \nstandard construction impacts. An associated requirement for adequate treatment of collected \nwastewater  has  been  mitigated  through  project  assurances.  Extensive  public  consultations ", " 19\ninvolving meetings with stakeholders, focus group discussions, and surveys were undertaken \ntwice during preparation of the environmental impact report. \n \n75.  The possible adverse environmental impacts associated with the subprojects will be \nprevented, or minimized to an acceptable level, if the EMP, set out in the summary initial \nenvironmental examination (SIEE) (Supplementary Appendix P), is effectively implemented. The \nenvironmental analysis is provided in Appendix 12.  \nE.  Health Impact \n76.  The improved environmental situation will reduce the population exposed to waterborne \ndiseases from various sources such as direct contact through washing, pollution of water supply \nresources, and consumption of polluted shellfish. This will lead to a corresponding decline in \nmedical costs and the number of workdays lost due to sickness. The medical cost savings for \nthe elderly, women, children, and the poor would be greater, as they are most vulnerable to \nsuch diseases. Women will benefit from the improvements in sanitation, water quality, and \nurban  environment  as  a  result  of  the  Project.  The  poor,  who  are  exposed  to  unsanitary \nconditions  and  flooding,  will  gain  more  than  the  average  population  from  improved \nenvironmental and living conditions. To realize the full health benefits, parallel improvements in \nwater supply, public health education, higher standards of personal hygiene, disease prevention \nand control, and improved housing and living conditions will be required. The health impact \nassessment is in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n \nF.  Poverty Impact \n \n77.  The  Project  supports  the  achievement  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goal  for \nenvironmental sustainability (goal 7), which aims to halve the proportion of people without \nsustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015 (target 10), through \nimproved  urban  environmental  management.  The  Project  will  directly  benefit  an  urban \npopulation of 370,000 by improving environmental conditions and enhancing sanitation through \nwastewater treatment, flood prevention, and control. Of the beneficiary population, 1.5% are \nclassified as poor, living below the standard poverty line of CNY1,500 per capita per annum in \nJiaozhou City.  \n78.  The Project has incorporated two key features to benefit the poor. First, to mitigate the \nfinancial burden of the poor from increased wastewater tariffs, the Project has negotiated with \nthe Government that subsidies will be provided to poorer families. Second, the Project will \nprovide 75% of the jobs generated in the Project to vulnerable groups, including the poor and \nwomen. It is expected that the Project will generate about 3,400 jobs during construction. To \nmaximize the project benefits, women will be given priority in the employment and training \nopportunities generated in the Project\u2019s construction and operation phases. \n79.  The Project is also expected to have the following positive effects on the poor: (i) \nimprovement of the living environment by providing better wastewater collection and cleaning up \nthe  polluted  rivers;  (ii)  reduction  of  waterborne  diseases  by  improving  environmental  and \ndrinking water problems; and (iii) reduction of natural disaster (flooding) associated damages, \nmitigating possible loss of shelter and assets. \n80.  Public  consultation  and  participation,  which  have  been  key  elements  of  the  project \ndesign,  will  continue  during  project  implementation,  monitoring,  and  evaluation.  Ongoing \nconsultations  also  will  be  carried  out  by  the  PMO  to  (i)  meet  the  evolving  needs  and \nexpectations of the users, (ii) increase the awareness of the public about the benefits of the \n ", "20  \nProject, (iii) encourage the active involvement of local communities to maximize their support for \nthe Project, (iv) promote environmental protection, and (v) raise the social acceptance of tariff \nincreases.  \n81.  The social and poverty assessment conducted during the TA implementation suggested \nthat no indigenous people or ethnic minorities will be adversely affected. The summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 13. Details are in Supplementary Appendix O.  \nG.  Resettlement \n82.  Resettlement impacts have been identified and a resettlement plan has been prepared \nin accordance with the PRC land law and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). All \nsubcomponents were planned to minimize disruption of residential areas and communities. \nImpacts  will  include:  (i)  acquisition  of  42.1  mu17 collective  land  is  required,  affecting  15 \nhouseholds with 51 persons; (ii) loss of use of 48.7 mu of informal farmland along the river \nbanks or inside the current reservoirs/ponds, affecting 60 households with 212 persons; and (iii) \ntemporary use of 149 mu of state-owned land. Land acquisition and resettlement costs are \nestimated at CNY2.8 million, or $0.4 million (representing less than 1% of total project base \ncosts). The summary resettlement plan is provided in Appendix 14. \n83.  A due-diligence review (Supplementary Appendix N) of the resettlement associated with \nthe  implementation  of  the  Shaohai  Lake  development  was  undertaken.  The  resettlement \ndocumentation  has  been  reviewed  and  the  implementation  of  the  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement has been undertaken satisfactorily in compliance with the PRC regulations and \nlaws. It is considered that resettlement issues were addressed and mitigated adequately. The \nproposed extension of the existing WWTP will not involve any land acquisition or resettlement \nas land was previously acquired during the development of the first phase of the WWTP in \n2004.  \n84.  ADB  requires  internal  and  external  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  resettlement \nimplementation. The PMO will report progress regularly to the EA, which will summarize the \nland acquisition and resettlement progress in the quarterly progress reports to ADB. The PMO \nwill retain the services of a domestic monitor for external monitoring and evaluation. The monitor \nwill visit the subcomponents every 6 months to (i) review resettlement progress and the general \nwelfare of those affected, (ii) recommend ways to resolve any issues or problems, and (iii) \nprovide advice to PMO and local officials. The monitor will pay special attention to women, to \nassess whether they have fully regained their standard of living. Monitoring and evaluation \nreports will be prepared every 6 months during implementation, followed by an annual report 1 \nyear after the completion of resettlement. These reports will be submitted simultaneously to \nADB and the EA. They also will be uploaded onto the ADB website. \n \nH.  Risks and Mitigation Measures \n \n85.  The Project does not have any unusual technical risks. Standard engineering designs \nwill be adopted for flood control and wastewater management. During project implementation, \nconsultants will support the PMO by undertaking design review and ensuring that constructed \nworks, goods, and equipment comply with bidding documents and associated quality standards. \n                                                 \n17  1 mu =  0.067 hectares. \n ", " 21\n86.  The following risks could affect timely implementation and economic viability, and reduce \nthe available benefits of the Project: (i) the WWTP extension and process enhancement is not \nundertaken in parallel by JCG during the implementation of the Project; (ii) insufficient capacity \nto  ensure  proper  O&M  of  project  facilities;  (iii)  ineffective  organizational  structures  and \ninadequate capacity of the PMO, which could result in inefficient project development and \nimplementation delays; (iv) delays in the provision of counterpart funding; (v) failure of JCG to \nincrease  wastewater  tariffs  to  meet  cost  recovery  targets;  and  (vi)  the  proposed  SEA \nimplementation delayed and not in parallel with the development of planning proposals for urban \ndevelopment around Jiaozhou Bay.   \n87.  Risk (i) will be mitigated by synchronizing the implementation of the WWTP extension \nwith that of the interceptor network. JCG will provide specific assurances that are covenanted in \nthe Loan Agreement to this effect. Risks (ii) and (iii) will be mitigated through provision of \ntargeted capacity building for the PMO with the support of consultants. Risks (iv) and (v) will be \nmitigated through covenanted assurances from JCG on the provision of counterpart funding, \nand regular tariff reviews and increases. Risk (vi) will be mitigated by the provision of specific \ntechnical assistance by ADB to the Government. \n  \nVI.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITION \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n88.

The proposed Qingdao Water Resources and Wetland Protection is located in Jiaozhou \ncounty-level city, Qingdao municipality, in the southeast of Shandong Peninsula. Qingdao, the \nso-called  Eastern  Switzerland,  surrounds  Jiaozhou  Bay  in  the  Yellow  Sea  and  faces  the \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic of Korea, Republic of Korea, and Japan. As an important coastal \ncity  with  an  increasingly  open  economy,  Qingdao\u2019s  annual  gross  domestic  product  has \nincreased at an average of more than 10% per year since 1990. Its major industries include \ntourism, electrical appliances, and petrochemicals. Qingdao is also a major city for finance and \nforeign trade in Shandong Province. Seven districts and five county-level cities are under the \nadministration of Qingdao with a total area of 10,654 square kilometers (km2) and a total \npopulation of 7 million people. In addition, Qingdao was the host city for the sailing regatta of the \n29th Olympiad which was held in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in August 2008.  \n \n2.  Qingdao, including Jiaozhou City, has experienced rapid economic development over \nthe past three decades through intensive public investments and by encouraging foreign and \nprivate investors to participate in its development plans and activities. This has resulted in rapid \nurban  and  industrial  development,  along  with  the  associated  problems  which  have  had \ndetrimental effects on the water resources and on the overall condition of the municipality\u2019s \nenvironment. The Qingdao municipal government (QMG) is aware of the need to address these \nproblems and strengthen the capacity of the institutions that are mandated to manage water \nresources and the environment in order to meet its development objectives and targets. It is \nalso aware of the need for a comprehensive and integrated water resource and environmental \nmanagement approach to address the complex and interrelated problems as a requisite for \nsustainable economic development and improved quality of life within the Jiaozhou Bay area. \n \n3.  It is for this purpose that QMG is requesting assistance from the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) in designing a project that will effectively address these problems which, in turn, \nmay serve as a pilot for further replication to other economic/industrial zones in the bay area. \nThis is particularly relevant to, and consistent with, QMG\u2019s master plan for Jiaozhou Bay, which \naims for balanced development along the western and eastern parts of the bay. \n \n4.  The Project incorporates the following plans: \n \n(i)  In 2006, the Shandong Peninsula City Cluster Development Strategy Plan1 was \napproved by the Shandong provincial government and has been implemented \nsince the end of 2006. The general objective of the plan is to develop Shandong \nPeninsula cluster cities to be one of the essential advanced manufacturing and \nservice centers in the PRC and even in the economic region around the Yellow \nSea. Qingdao is one of the eight core cities and will be developed into the largest \ncity in Shandong. The population of Qingdao is expected to be about 12 million \nby 2020, and the population of Jiaozhou about 1 million. As a leading city in \nShandong Province and middle-to-downstream Yellow River area, Qingdao will \nbe developed into an international seaport and a developed and coastal tourist \ncity with modern manufacturing and service industries with an urban population \nof 5 to 5.5 million. \n \n(ii)  In order to incorporate Shandong Peninsula City Cluster Development Strategy \nPlan,  QMG  started  to  adjust  the  Qingdao  Master  Plan  in  March  2008.  The \n                                                 \n1 Shangdong Provincial Government. 2006. Shandong Peninsula City Cluster Development Strategy Plan. Jinan.  \n ", "28   Appendix 2 \nprincipal  concept  was  to  involve  the  whole  Jiaozhou  Bay  development  and \naddress the issue of an extra 3 to 3.5 million in 2020 in Qingdao urban area. One \nof the key issues for the new planning is to focus on the detailed planning of \nseveral regions, including Shaohai New Area in Jiaozhou City. The features of \nthe new bay development will highlight environment priority, industry, tourism, \nand ecological conservation eco-supporting in planning new urban areas. \n \n(iii)  Water  resources  and  environmental  management  are  always  critical  in \ndevelopment. Qingdao has set as its goal to improve the integrity of its ecological \nand environmental position in its 11th Five-Year Plan (FYP). In line with these \npolicy statements and consistent with its 11th FYP and overall plan for economic \ndevelopment,  QMG  intends  to  improve  its  capacity  for  water  resources  and \nenvironmental management by focusing on Jiaozhou City, which suffers from a \nvariety of interrelated problems related to severe flooding, and consequently, \npollution  of  its  watercourses  and  overall  environment.  Structural  and \nnonstructural measures will be considered simultaneously to effectively address \nthe problem of environmental degradation. \n \n5.  Jiaozhou is situated at the head of the Jiaozhou Bay area, encompassing the lower \nestuarine reaches of the Dagu River (the largest river basin in Qingdao Municipality). The \ncoastal wetlands of Jiaozhou Bay are vital, representing the most important coastal wetland \necosystem in Qingdao coastal region, providing breeding grounds for many types of fish and \nshellfish, a resting place for migratory birds, as well as maintaining coastal biological diversity. \nIn addition, the wetlands absorb excessive nutrients in the river flow before it reaches the sea, \nthereby reducing eutrophication in Jiaozhou Bay. \n \n6.  Since  the  1950s,  the  coastal  wetlands  around  Jiaozhou  Bay  have  been  severely \nimpacted by human activities including urbanization, industrialization, and the intensification of \nagriculture. From 1950 to 2000, it is estimated that the wetland area has been reduced by 30%; \nmoreover, natural wetland has been replaced by artificial wetland such as salt and fishery \n(shellfish/shrimp) ponds. The water environment in Jiaozhou City has deteriorated significantly. \nAs the same time, urbanization has changed the population structure and water consumption in \nthis area. Both existing natural environmental resources and management systems are facing \nbig challenges to prevent further degradation in wetland areas and the water environment, as \nwell as to maintain fast economic and social development in this area.   \n \nA.   Overview of Water Resources and Environment in Qingdao and Jiaozhou  \n \n7.  Qingdao is a coastal city located at the tip of the Shandong Peninsula between the \nYellow Sea to its east and southeast, and Jiaozhou Bay to its west and southwest. The total \narea of Qingdao Municipality is 10,654 km2, including cultivated land of approximately 484,600 \nhectares (ha). Annual rainfall is only 689.2 millimeters (mm) on average, but large water surface \nevaporative losses (about 1,000\u20131,100 mm annually), compounded by uneven geographic and \nseasonal distributions, present particular challenges for water resource management. Total \nannual water resources are only 313\u2013342 cubic meters (m3 ) per capita, only about 14% of the \nnational average and far less than 500 m3 per capita which is recognized as the international \nstandard for water scarcity. Due to the serious water shortage, the Yellow River has been \ndiverted since 1990 for municipal and industrial use in Qingdao City and southern Laoshan \nDistrict,  with  51\u2013130  million  m3/year  being  diverted.  The  current  domestic  water  tariff  is \nCNY2.5/m3 (including CNY0.7/m3 for wastewater treatment charge) and is considered low as it \ndoes not reflect the actual production costs, which are estimated at about CNY3\u20134/ m3.  \n ", "  Appendix 2  29 \n \n8.  According to the Qingdao Environmental Report 20062, the water quality in 40.4% of 31 \nriver courses was found to meet class III national surface water standard or better; the water \nquality in 42.9% of 47 river courses was found to be worse than class V standard. There were \naround 75,000 wells supplying water from underground in Qingdao Municipality in 2004. In \ngeneral, groundwater quality is poor in shallow aquifers, as reported in the Qingdao Water \nResources Report 2006. Poor water quality was reported in more than 65% of monitored wells.  \n \n9.  Jiaozhou is in the southwest of Jiaodong Peninsula and in western Qingdao Municipality, \nalong the northwestern side of Jiaozhou Bay. The area of the city is 1,210 km2. The central \nregion of the city  consists of hills and plains while the northeast region consists of alluvial \nplains. The eastern region has the estuary where the land and the sea join. Jiaozhou has a \ntemperate monsoon climate, with high humidity, high rainfall, and moderate temperatures; the \nannual average temperature in Jiaozhou is 12\u00b0 centigrade. The average annual wind speed is \nestimated  at  5.3  meters  per  second,  and  is  predominantly  from  the  southeast.  The  city\u2019s \naverage annual rainfall is estimated at 776 mm, and annual water evaporation rate is 1,100 mm. \nMost of the rainfall occurs from June to September. Rainfall can be heavy in July and August \nand lead to flooding.   \n \n10.  There are 27 rivers in Jiaozhou City, and these are mainly tributaries to three water \nsystems\u2014the Dagu, South Jiaolai, and Yanghe rivers. These rivers are characterized by rapid \nflow and short river courses and brief riverhead. During the high-water season, flash floods \nfrequently occur, while during the low-water season, run-off is so low that the rivers usually dry \nup. In urban areas, the Yunxi River from the west and the Danzi (Sanli) River from the west-\nsouthwest join and flow into Dagu River in eastern Jiaozhou City. Water quality in both the \nYunxi and Danzi rivers is poor. In 2005, there were 50 reservoirs operating in Jiaozhou City. \nThese included two medium-sized reservoirs and 48 small reservoirs, with a total water storage \ncapacity of 62 million m3.  \n \n11.  There  are  two  operating  water  supply  factories  owned by  the  Jiaozhou  City  Water \nCompany with a capacity of about 60,000 m3/day, a service area of 50 km2, and servicing a \npopulation of about 300,000 including Jiaozhou urban area, Jiaodong town, and Yinhai town. \nThe Qianhan water factory, with a design capacity of 35,000 m3/day, obtains groundwater from \nthe Dagu River basin. The Zhuanglitou water factory, with a design capacity of 20,000 m3/day, \nobtains surface water from the Sanzhou and Qingnien reservoirs. Due to the aging water supply \nfacilities (which were built nearly 40 years ago) and poor maintenance of distribution networks, \nthe water loss ratio is estimated to be 25% including leakage, billing errors, and unmetered \nwater use. Jiaozhou wastewater treatment plant (phase I) was constructed in 2003 with a \ndesign capacity of 50,000 m3/day. The other wastewater treatment plant, with a capacity of \n20,000 m3/day, was built in the industry park for textile factories.  \n \n12.  A wetland area is located in the eastern part of Jiaozhou. The Jiaozhou Bay and Dagu \nEstuary wetland, the only wetland in Qingdao Municipality, is included in the national wetlands \nprotection list. The wetland covers the mudflat and beach from the freshwater zone of the Dagu \nEstuary to the low-saltwater zone of Jiaozhou Bay, and has a total area of about 50,000 ha. The \nwetlands are home to 156 species of waterfowl and miscellaneous fish, and habitat for post-\nhouse to many migratory birds. However, due to the adverse impacts of industrial development \nand agricultural activities, the wetlands have suffered from severe pollution and destruction in \nrecent years. The number of wildlife species is declining and ecosystem functions are impaired, \n                                                 \n2 Qingdao Environmental Protection Bureau. 2006. Qingdao Environmental Report. Qingdao. \n ", "30   Appendix 2 \nespecially in some areas along the eastern bank of Jiaozhou Bay which are already degraded \nand consequently can no longer function as natural wildlife habitats.  \n \nB.  Problems Affecting Water Resources and Environment in Qingdao and Jiaozhou \n \n13.  With  rapid  urban  development  and  population  growth,  water  shortages  as  well  as \nfrequent  flooding  have  become  key  constraints  to  sustainable  development  in  Qingdao \nMunicipality and Jiaozhou City. The latter has implemented various water conservation and \nmanagement  projects  in  recent  years.  However,  it  is  constrained  by  inadequate  funds  for \ninvesting in new (and incomplete) water resources management infrastructures as well as poor \nmaintenance and management. Key problems affecting the Jiaozhou environment sector are \nsummarized as follows: \n \n(i)  Frequent destructive floods. Jiaozhou City suffers from frequent destructive \nfloods due to the natural topography and ineffective river flood control system. \nThere are three main kinds of floods. First, high water level in the main stream of \nthe Dagu River outside the Ccity combined with high tide level restricts the \ndischarge of the Yunxi and Sanli rivers from Jiaozhou City area; furthermore, \nstorm surges from the Dagu River go back to Jiaozhou City through these rivers \nin some situations. Within the city, floods are induced by either problems with the \ndrainage system or local river flooding from the Yunxi and Sanli rivers. The \nJiaozhou municipal government constructed a proper flood gate in the Yunxi \nRiver in 2003 to prevent the storm surges from the Dagu River and has started to \nbuild  a  floodplain  (named  Shaohai  Lake)  to  contain  the  floodwaters  from \nJiaozhou City. There is still the need for improved drainage facilities in flood-\nprone areas to prevent waterlogging, and upgrade watercourses in local rivers. \n \n(ii)  Water  pollution  and  subsequent  impact  on  environment.  Severe  water \npollution has become an increasing problem in the city. In 2006, the Jiaozhou \nEnvironmental Protection Bureau carried out wastewater discharge investigation. \nThe survey shows that, within Jiaozhou City, about 48,500 m3/day of wastewater \nis discharged into the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP); an additional 31,000 \nm3/day is discharged directly into rivers. A significant portion of the untreated \neffluent  is  industrial  wastewater.  Effluent  from  the  Textile  Industrial  Park  is \ncurrently  treated  at  a  specialized  WWTP  for  the  park;  other  industrial  area \nwastewater is discharged directly into the rivers or the sewers, many of which are \ncurrently not connected to the centralized WWTP. As a result, based on water \nquality surveys by Jiaozhou Environmental Monitoring Station in 2005, the water \nquality in the rivers through the main urban area is poor and classified as class V; \ntotal phosphorus and chemical oxygen demand exceed acceptable standards. \n \n(iii)  Water loss and soil erosion. Jiaozhou experiences severe water loss and soil \nerosion  every  year  with  significant  adverse  impact  on  production,  living \nconditions,  and  integrity  of  the  environment  in  the  affected  drainage  basins. \nContributing  to  this  situation  is  the  lack  of  a  comprehensive  plan  for \ncontrolling/preventing water losses and soil erosion for the city. Moreover, there \nis need to raise public awareness of water conservation as well as to establish \nmeasures for curbing and monitoring activities that contribute to this problem. \nInstitutional capacities for supervising and monitoring soil and water conservation \nand management also need to be strengthened. \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  31 \n(iv)  Weak  institutional  capacity  and  nonstructural  measures  for  water  resource \nmanagement.  The  capacity  of  relevant  institutions  involved  in  water  resources \nmanagement  in  Jiaozhou  City  cannot  match  the  requirement  for  developing  and \nimplementing  projects/programs/strategies  concerning  integrated  water  resources \nplanning and management. There is a need for assistance for developing mechanisms \nand strengthening capacities for monitoring of water-related activities and the required \nenforcement of regulations for ensuring that the water quality from scarce resources is \nmaintained properly for drinking purposes. This requires a complete human resource \ndevelopment  plan  for  improving  institutional  capacities,  as  well  as  the  provision  of \nincentives to limit the rapid turnover of staff. Furthermore, plans and policies related to \nwater resources management need further clarification and be actually integrated into \nthe  district  overall  development  plan.  Emphasis  should  be  made  on  nonstructural \nmeasures for improving water resources management and conservation such as (a) \nintroduction  of  an  integrated  information  system,  which  will  apply  real-time  data \nacquisition, a geographic information system platform, river courses and drainage/sewer \nsystem  simulation  software,  and  a  decision  support  system  for  real-time  flood \nmanagement; (b) training for the corporatization of wastewater services; (c) planning for \nwastewater tariff reform; and (d) strict enforcement of regulations for water conservation \nand environmental protection (those measures which have already been installed need \nto  be  reviewed  and  strengthened).  This  should  be  complemented  by  exploring \nalternative improved management practices and technology for flood control and water \nresources conservation. The detailed discussions are in Supplementary Appendixes C \nand L. \n \n14.  In addition, water shortage, low awareness of water conservation, and high potable \nwater leakage, are existing constraints. Jiaozhou City is currently exploring opportunities for \nmaximizing its surface water retention capacity through improvements to existing reservoirs \n(particularly the Guanlu reservoir) and water diversion projects. There is also need to maximize \nutilization  of  existing  storage  capacity  of  flood  retention  areas  in  conjunction  with  new \nconstruction of flood control infrastructure in urban areas. This will ensure availability of safe \ndrinking water in urban and rural areas. \n \n15.  While Jiaozhou City has implemented various water conservation and management \nprojects, including notably the development of Shaohai Lake (serving both as a flood retention \nzone and artificial wetland at the confluence with the Dagu River) and the first phase of the \ncentralized wastewater treatment facilities, there are still significant opportunities to improve \nenvironmental management in relation to (i) the collection and interception of industrial and \ndomestic wastewater discharge directly into watercourses, (ii) expansion and enhancement of \nthe  centralized  treatment  facilities  to  protect  the  Dagu  River/Jiaozhou  Bay  wetlands,  (iii) \nimprovement of rivers and storm-water networks in the old urban area, (iv) development of an \nintegrated  approach  to  flood  management  incorporating  the  different  structural  and \nnonstructural measures currently operated separately by different entities, and (v) continuing \ninstitutional  and  financial  management  reforms  to  facilitate  sustainable  environmental \nmanagement. \n ", "3\n    2\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPROBLEM TREE ANALYSIS                \n \n \nA\np\np\nLow quality  Unsustainable

Introduction \n \n1.  The sector analysis and lessons learned have identified three priority issues that need to \nbe  improved  in  the  implementation  of  the  ecosystem-based  integrated  water  resources \nmanagement  scheme:  (i)  integrated  planning  and  analysis,  (ii)  an  effective  management \nscheme, and (iii) an appropriate mechanism to monitor and ensure effective implementation. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n2.  The expected impact of the technical assistance (TA) is the strengthened capacity of the \nQingdao municipal government (QMG) in strategic environmental planning and management to \nsupport sustainable economic development in the Jiaozhou Bay area. The expected outcome of \nthe  TA  is  the  increased  protection  of  Jiaozhou  Bay  water  quality  and  wetland  ecosystem \nthrough the development of a strategic environmental assessment (SEA).   \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n3.  The advisory TA has three outputs: (i) support the creation of an effective management \nmechanism  for  strategic  environmental  and  planning  process,  (ii)  strategic  environmental \nassessment, and (iii) operational guidelines and monitoring system for implementation.  \n \n1.  Support the Creation of an Effective Management Mechanism for Strategic \nEnvironmental and Planning Process  \n \n4.  This component comprises the following activities: (i) development of a work plan for the \nSEA process through a participatory approach involving the key stakeholders in the \u201cembracing \nbay development\u201d strategy; (ii) establishment of an effective mechanism for information, data \nand  documents  collection,  including  data/information  on  planning,  economic  development, \necological zoning, land resources, water, soil erosion, and meteorology; (iii) strengthening of \ninformation exchange for all stakeholders involved in the SEA process; and (iv) establishment of \na distribution network to inform the SEA progress.  \n \n2.  Strategic Environmental Assessment of the \u201cEmbracing Bay Development, \nSurrounding Bay Protection\u201d Strategy \n \n5.  Through the SEA process, the TA aims to map out an integrated water resources and \nenvironmental plan for further developing the other parts of Jiaozhou Bay. The \u201cembracing bay \ndevelopment\u201d strategy formulation and SEA practice will be an interactive process. The outline \nterms of reference for the consultants are as follows: (i) review the existing international and \nnational experiences in SEA, in consideration of coastal zone management, a bay development \nstrategy, and a regional development plan; (ii) carry out a baseline survey on water quality, \nwater and land resources availability, and marine biodiversity types in Jiaozhou Bay; (iii) identify \nthe environmentally and ecologically sensitive areas in the bay area, and formulate an inventory \nof environmental limitation factors, which will provide the basis for the strategy, particularly in \nterms of land-use planning and industrial sector distributions; (iv) utilize necessary modeling \ntechniques to assess the potential impacts caused by the proposed strategy and related action \nplans,  including  direct,  indirect,  and  cumulative  impacts;  and  (v)  recommend  measures  to \nimprove  the  strategy  formulation  process,  and  propose  necessary  safeguards  measures \n(institutional, legal, instrumental, and investment) to ensure the sustainable development of \nJiaozhou Bay. \n ", "42  Appendix 9 \n \n3.  Operational Guidelines and Monitoring System for Implementation  \n6.  The TA will support QMG to further develop operational guidelines and a monitoring \nsystem for SEA implementation. It will help the Executing Agency (EA) prepare an operational \nmanual for strengthening QMG\u2019s capacity to develop a sustainable regional development plan \naround the bay area. In view of the large number of natural resources involved and associated \nlarge number of long-term activities to be executed, the TA will assist the EA in establishing a \ncomputer-based information and monitoring system to monitor the changes in natural resources \naround the bay and maintain the record of SEA implementation. The outline terms of references \nare  as  follows:  (i)  review  and  analyze  the  necessary  techniques  for  regional  integrated \nenvironmental management and planning (or regional environmental assessment); (ii) based on \nthe findings of component 2, help the EA prepare an operational manual for rapid environmental \nassessment, covering detailed guidelines on a baseline survey, valuation of the ecosystem, \nimpact assessment of specific regional development plans, the interactive process between \nrapid environmental assessment and regional plan formulation, an integrated marine ecosystem \nmanagement approach, and related safeguards measures; and (iii) help the EA develop a \ncomputer-based monitoring system to monitor the environmental impacts and natural resources \nchanges during the strategy implementation. This monitoring system will also provide the basis \nto examine if the SEA is effectively implemented, and, if necessary, suggest  improvements to \nthe safeguards measures. It is necessary to ensure the SEA is a continuous process and leads \ntowards the social and economic development of Jiaozhou Bay being sustainable.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangement \n \n7.  QMG is the EA for the TA. QMG has established the Leading Group for Qingdao \nEmbracing Bay Development Strategy Formulation. This group is headed by the vice-mayor of \nQMG,  and  consists  of  senior  officials  (at  deputy  director  general  level)  from  various  line \nagencies. 1 The leading group will provide overall guidance to the formulation of an \u201cembracing \nbay development\u201d document and the related SEA process.  \n \n8.  A  cross-agency  SEA  preparation  committee  will  be  established  in  Qingdao \nEnvironmental Protection Bureau (EPB), chaired by the director general of the Qingdao EPB \nand  comprising  senior  officials  of  the  Water  Resources  Bureau,  Ocean  Bureau,  Planning \nBureau, Land Resources Bureau, and environmental monitoring stations, and the divisions for \ninternational cooperation, pollution control, environmental impact assessment, and ecological \nconservation in the Qingdao EPB. A technical management office will be established in the \nenvironmental impact assessment division of the Qingdao EPB. \n \n9.  The consultant team will comprise six international consultants for 15 person-months \nand eight national consultants for 60 person-months, and detailed terms of references are \nprovided in Supplementary Appendix D. The indicative international consultants include (i) an \nSEA specialist/team leader (4 person-months), (ii) a marine ecosystem management specialist \n(3 person-months), (iii) a wetland ecologist (3 person-months), (iv) a regional planning specialist \n(1 person-month), (v) an integrated water resources management specialist (2 person-months), \n                                                 \n1  The vice-mayor of QMG serves as the chair of this leading group, with the participation of the senior officials from \nPlanning  Bureau,  Financial  Bureau,  Qingdao  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  Economy  and  Trade, \nConstruction Bureau, Environmental Protection Bureau, Land Resources Bureau, Ocean and Fishery Bureau, \nTransportation Commission, Public Utility Bureau, Labor and Social Security Bureau, Foreign Trade and Economic \nCooperation Bureau, state-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, Standing Committee of \nCommunist Party Central Committee of Shinan District, Shibei District, Sifang District, Li Chang District and \nChengyang District, Science and Technology Committee, Economic Development Zone, and Jiaozhou Municipal \nCommission.    \n ", "  Appendix 9  43 \nand  (vi)  an  environmental  management  specialist  (2  person-months).  Indicative  national \nconsultants include (i) an SEA specialist/deputy team leader (12 person-months), (ii) a water \nresources planner/hydrologist (10 person-months), (iii) a wetland ecologist (8 person-months), \n(iv) a water-quality modeling specialist (6 person-months), (v) a social development specialist (6 \nperson-months), (vi) a management information system specialist (6 person-months), (vii) an \nenvironmental economist (6 person-months), and (viii) planning and management trainers (6- \nperson months).  \n \n10.

Introduction \n1.  The Government does not charge beneficiaries directly for its flood protection services \nand other project-related environmental services. The interventions will not directly generate any \nrevenues. Therefore, the project financial analysis only focuses on three aspects: (i) fund flow \nand  Jiaozhou  City\u2019s  fiscal  capacity,  (ii)  the  project  management  office\u2019s  (PMO)  financial \nmanagement capacity, and (iii) the Project\u2019s financial sustainability.  \n \nB.  Fund Flow and Jiaozhou City\u2019s Fiscal Capacity  \n2.  Qingdao municipality is one of the few special cases in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC) which reports directly to the central Government in terms of its fiscal revenues and \noutlays. Therefore, in terms of loan disbursement, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan \nproceeds will be disbursed directly from the Ministry of Finance to the Qingdao Financial Bureau \n(QFB) which is under the Qingdao municipal government (QMG). The imprest fund account will \nbe set up in QFB, which has prior experience in dealing with loans from international institutions \nsuch as the World Bank, Japan Bank for International Cooperation, and ADB. QFB then onlends \nthe loan proceeds to the Jiaozhou Finance Bureau (JFB) with the same loan terms. JFB \ndisburses the funds to the contractors for project implementation. In terms of loan repayment, \nJFB pays QMG on behalf of the Jiaozhou city government (JCG). QMG then repays the Ministry \nof Finance, which in turn repays ADB. The fund flow of the proposed project is shown in \nAppendix 6. \n \n3.  By a comprehensive evaluation on GDP value, growth rate and development potential, \nJiaozhou City was ranked fourth among county-level cities in Shandong Province and 26th \namong top 100 county-level cities in all of the PRC in 2005. In 2007, its gross domestic product \n(GDP) was estimated at CNY42 billion and GDP per capita was about CNY50,000. The internal \nfiscal revenue of Jiaozhou City was about CNY1.5 billion. Total revenues, including transfers \nfrom the upper-level governments (i.e., Qingdao Municipality, Shandong provincial government, \nand central Government), are estimated at about CNY1.7 billion.  \n4.  By the end of the 11th Five-Year Plan (FYP, 2010), Jiaozhou City sets the fiscal target of \n\u201c3211\u201d, which means (i) the internal fiscal revenue of the city proper should reach CNY3 billion, \n(ii) the disposable income for urban inhabitants should be CNY20,000 per capita, (iii) the net \nincome of rural inhabitants should be CNY10,000, and (iv) the GDP per capita should be \nCNY10,000. Projections of GDP and aggregate fiscal revenue were conducted according to the \n11th FYP based on historical data provided by Jiaozhou\u2019s project implementation office (PIO) \n(Table A10). \n5.  The Jiaozhou fiscal revenue situation indicates that adequate funds are available for the \nproject counterpart contribution and debt servicing. Although there are multiple sources where \nsuch funds can be drawn from, such as land-use fees, urban construction and maintenance \ntaxes, and wastewater tariffs, the major source is the land-use fees and urban construction and \nmaintenance taxes. These are estimated at an annual average of CNY655 million and have \nbeen stable in the past (Table A10).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "    Appendix 10  45 \nTable A10: Projections of GDP and Aggregate Fiscal Revenue  \nItem 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\nFunds required for counterpart contribution and debt servicing (CNY million)a 93 98 103 104 18 36 35 35\nGDP (CNY million) 60,236 72,284 86,018 102,361 121,809 144,953 172,494 205,268\nFunds required for counterpart contribution  \n    and debt servicing as a percentage of GDP (%) 0.15 0.14 0.12 0.10 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.02\nFiscal revenue (CNY million) 2,803 3,476 4,170 5,014 6,012 7,220 8,660 10,394\n Funds required for counterpart contribution  \n      and debt servicing as a percentage of fiscal revenue  3.32 2.82 2.47 2.07 0.30 0.50 0.40 0.34\nPotential sources of funds: land-use fee and urban construction \n      and maintenance fee (CNY million) 655 664 675 687 702 720 741 766\nFunds required for counterpart contribution and debt servicing as a percentage\n       of land-user fee and urban construction and maintenance fee (%) 14.20 14.75 15.27 15.13 2.56 5.00 4.73 4.57\na Including the outstanding debt service of the World Bank loan of CNY0.5 million\u2013CNY0.8 million per year.\nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n \n6.  With the Project, the total counterpart contribution and debt service for Jiaozhou ranges \nfrom CNY93 million to CNY104 million during the project implementation period of 2009 to 2012, \nthen decreases to CNY18 million to CNY36 million per year after 2012. This is about 0.15% of \nthe projected GDP of Jiaozhou in 2009, and is projected to decrease to 0.02% of GDP in 2016. \nAccording to the projection of the fiscal status of Jiaozhou City to 2020, the total counterpart \ncontribution and debt service account for 3% of the city\u2019s total fiscal revenue in the first year of \nproject  implementation  in  2009  and  decrease  to  about  2%  in  2012,  the  last  year  of \nimplementation. Total counterpart funds and debt service as a percentage of total potential \nsources  of  funds  range  from  14%  to  15%  during  2009\u20132014,  the  period  of  project \nimplementation.  This  is  projected  to  decrease  to  about  3%\u20135%  thereafter.  As  counterpart \ncontribution and debt service accounts for only a small proportion of funds available, it is safe to \nconclude that JCG will more than adequately cover the required repayments under the loan \n(Table A10). \n \n7.  Jiaozhou City has experience in servicing loans from international financial institutions \nsuch as the World Bank and ADB. A subproject of Jiaozhou Carbon Black Group, with an ADB \nloan amount of $25 million, was included in the Qingdao Tyre Project1 in 1989. The loan \nmaturity was 20 years with a 4-year grace period. The debt service has been fulfilled according \nto the loan agreement and there is no outstanding loan amount for this Project. A World Bank-\nfinanced subproject of the Qingdao Irrigation, with the loan amount of $1.43 million, started from \nfiscal year 2001 with a loan period of 20 years and a grace period of 5 years. The outstanding \ndebt service is shown in Table A10. \n \nC.   Project Financial Management Assessment  \n8.  The  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  has  been  undertaken  to  assess  the \ninstitutional  capacity  of  each  implementing  agency,  funds  flow  arrangements,  staffing, \naccounting policies and procedures, internal and external auditing arrangements, reporting and \nmonitoring aspects, and information system. JCG is the Executing Agency (EA) of the proposed \nProject. A project management office (PMO) was set up within the Jiaozhou Construction \nBureau in May 2008. An FMA questionnaire was adapted to the subprojects\u2019 conditions and is \nshown in Supplementary Appendix J. Issues or risks associated with the financial management \nsystems are identified and the most appropriate risk mitigation measures are determined as part \nof project design and/or project implementation arrangements.   \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1989.

Manila (Loan 0987-PRC, $138.1 million, \neffective in June 1989) \n ", "46  Appendix 10 \n9.  The  results  of  the  FMA  questionnaire  were  analyzed  with  particular  focus  on  the \naccounting and auditing procedures and staff expertise. In terms of accounting and auditing \nprocedures, the existing financial information system (i.e., accounting, reporting, and internal \ncontrol system) is complete and applicable for domestic construction entities. The PMO has \nextensive  experience  in  implementing/constructing  infrastructure  projects  and  is  very \nknowledgeable in carrying out these works following the Accounting Standards for State-owned \nConstruction  Entities  issued  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  in  1995.  The  financial  statements \nprepared regularly according to the standards are (i) a balance sheet, (ii) an infrastructure \ninvestment statement, (iii) a statement of investment to be deferred, (iv) a statement of loans for \ninfrastructure, and (v) a statement of lump-sum investment. The statements are reported to JFB \non a monthly basis. The PMO uses accounting software (User Friend), from which all required \nfinancial statements are automatically produced. The PMO has also established budgeting \nsystems for internal control and a sound auditing system, both internally and externally. There is \nan internal auditor in Jiaozhou Construction Bureau (JCB) who performs auditing regularly. As a \ngovernment agency, it is audited annually by the Jiaozhou Auditing Bureau. It is also subject to \nexternal auditing each year and the auditing reports are usually produced by accounting firms \nbefore the end of the first quarter.  \n \n10.  In terms of staff expertise, the PMO has broad experience in infrastructure construction \nfinanced by domestic funds, but has not implemented any ADB projects. Training on ADB \nprocedures  and  advanced  financial  management  will  be  necessary  to  ensure  successful \nimplementation of the proposed Project. \n \nD.  Project Financial Sustainability Analysis \n \n11.  Project  financial  sustainability  was  conducted  by  comparing  the  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  costs  of  each  project  component  with  their  financing  sources.  Such \nanalysis  was  done  separately  for  the  flood  management  component  and  wastewater \nmanagement  component  of  the  Project.  Under  the  wastewater  management  component, \nconsideration was not only paid to the O&M of the wastewater collection and treatment but also \nto the O&M of the downstream wetlands.  \n12.  Financial Sustainability of the Flood Management Component. The rivers are not \nwell maintained in Jiaozhou City and 240,000 square meters (m2) river courses are currently \nmaintained only once a year. The annual O&M cost is only CNY480,000. With the Project, \n720,000 m2 of river course will be maintained three times a year, resulting in the increase of \nannual O&M costs to CNY4.32 million.  \n \n13.  The river course O&M cost is financed through the flood control management fee. Since \n2000,  JCG  has  been  collecting  the  flood  control  management  fee  for  the  river  course \nimprovement and flood control. It is levied at 0.1% of the turnover of enterprises in Jiaozhou \nCity. During 2003\u20132006, this turnover has increased from CNY20 to CNY55 billion, with an \nannual  growth  rate  of  over  30%.  Using  conservative  figures,  the  turnover  is  projected  to \nincrease at 10% per annum from 2007 to 2020. The flood management fee should be CNY55 \nmillion  in  2006,  but  the  collection  performance  before  2008  was  not  satisfactory,  with  the \ncollection rate of 10% or even less. Since May 2008, a new directive published by JCG stated \nthat  the  flood  management  fee  should  be  levied  together  with  other  mandatory  taxes  or \nsubtaxes,  such  as  urban  construction  and  maintenance  tax  and  education  sub-tax.  The \ncollection rate could be improved significantly from 10% in 2007 to 50% in 2008, and later in \n2020 could reach 85%. By year 2020, the flood management fee could reach CNY178 million. \nAnalysis shows that the O&M cost as a percentage of the total flood management fee revenue \nof the Government will decrease from 10% in 2006 to 2% in 2020. \n ", "    Appendix 10  47 \n \n14.  Financial Sustainability of the Wastewater Management Component. In order to \nassess  the  financial  sustainability  of  the  wastewater  network  subcomponent,  the  existing \nwastewater collection and treatment facilities were examined. Analysis shows that the annual \nO&M costs are about CNY16 million for the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), CNY2.3 \nmillion for the wastewater network, and CNY0.5 million for the pumping station.   \n \n15.  In terms of wastewater treatment, JCG pays the private sector operated WWTP at a \nbuild-operate-transfer (BOT) price of CNY0.998 per cubic meter (m3) and CNY18 million per \nannum. Therefore, the WWTP has adequate revenue to cover the O&M costs of wastewater \ntreatment. The Government collects wastewater treatment fees from households, institutions, \nand industries at different tariffs. Tariff analysis was conducted and the weighted average of \ntariff is CNY0.88/m3, CNY0.11 lower than the BOT price. This results in a fiscal subsidy of \naround  CNY2  million  per  year  for  wastewater  treatment.  The  subsidy  comes  from  the \nGovernment\u2019s general budget, especially from the urban construction and maintenance tax, \nwhich is around CNY46 million per annum. In the longer term, it is advisable to increase the \nwastewater treatment fees in order to reduce such subsidies,2 but in the short- and medium- \nterm, the Government has sufficient resources to cover the O&M for wastewater treatment.  \n \n16.  As far as the wastewater network is concerned, it is owned by JCG and operated and \nmaintained by the Municipal Engineering Division under JCB. An annual O&M cost of CNY2.3 \nmillion is partially financed by JCG (CNY1 million) and partially by profits of other engineering \nprojects operated by the Municipal Engineering Division (CNY1.3 million). The O&M cost of the \npumping station is around CNY500,000 per year, including CNY100,000 for electricity and \nCNY400,000 for eight management staff and three workers. While salaries are paid by the \nGovernment from budgetary recurrent expenditures, the electricity expenditure comes from the \nurban construction and maintenance tax. \n \n17.  River course management and wastewater collection and treatment will improve the \necological environment of Jiaozhou wetlands located at the downstream end of the Erli\u2019he River. \nHowever, the benefits of the wetlands will not be fully obtained unless there is an additional \nO&M  work  in  the  area.  The  wetland  in  Shaohai  will  be  managed  by  a  major  real  estate \ndeveloper  in  the  area,  Guangdong  Liantai  Real  Estate  Group  Corporation,  with  the  BOT \ncontract price of CNY3 billion including infrastructure construction and preparation, environment \nimprovement, and wetland protection. Wetlands in other areas will be maintained by the Water \nResource Bureau and the source of funds is the flood management fee which, according to the \nPMO, is sufficient for both river course and wetland. However, due to data limitations, such \ncosts cannot be accurately quantified at this stage.   \n                                                 \n2  Analysis shows that a tariff level of CNY1.35/m3 (as compared to the current tariff of an average of CNY0.88/m3) \nwould allow the wastewater treatment work to be self-financed, even with a small profit. A willingness-to-pay survey \nand an affordability analysis were conducted to assess households\u2019 acceptance of potential tariff increase in the \nfuture. Ninety percent of the interviewees, except the extreme poor, find the current water tariff acceptable. Other \nthings being equal, an increase of wastewater treatment fee from the current CNY0.70/m3 to CNY1.35/m3 would \nincrease the total water expenditure as a percentage of household total income from 0.6% in 2008 to 0.75% in \n2013.  More detailed analysis is included in Supplementary Appendix J.  \n \n ", "48  Appendix 11 \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Introduction \n1.  The proposed Qingdao Water Resources and Wetland Protection Project provides public \ngoods  including  flood  prevention,  wastewater  collection  and  treatment,  and  wetland \npreservation for the relatively densely populated county of Jiaozhou in Shandong Province. \nThere exists a clear and strong rationale for public interventions. The proposed Project includes \nboth  structural  and  nonstructural  components  including:  (i)  water  resources  and  flood \nmanagement,  (ii)  wastewater  management  and  pollution  control,  (iii)  integrated  water  and \necosystem  management,  and  (iv)  project  management  support.  In  addition,  a  strategic \nenvironmental assessment is proposed to be financed by an advisory technical assistance (TA) \nproject. Economic analysis was undertaken for the overall Project, including the TA, since the \nproposed interventions to improve flood control and management and to upgrade wastewater \ncollection and treatment are interrelated, and to some extent, strengthen each other. Similarly, \nno separation of the costs and benefits of structural and nonstructural benefits was attempted \nsince the nonstructural interventions were considered necessary to sustain the impact of the \nstructural ones. Achievement of the full benefits from wastewater activities will also require \ninvestment in an extension of the existing wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) by 2010, an \ninvestment  that  is  being  implemented  by  the  Government  through  a  build-operate-transfer \n(BOT) model. Completion of structural investments is expected to take 3 years and the final two \nproject years will be required to complete all nonstructural investments as well as for full \ncommissioning of the structural investments.  \n \n2.  The project life is assumed to be 25 years, including the 5-year implementation period. \nFlood control benefits are assumed to be fully achieved on completion of the infrastructure. \nBenefits from improved health and environment are staged over 3 and 5 years respectively, \nfollowing completion of investments, to reflect the build-up of impact from the nonstructural \ninvestments. For the economic analysis, economic costs and benefits have been valued using \nthe world price numeraire. Financial costs of nontraded goods are adjusted to their respective \neconomic values using a standard conversion factor of 0.93.1 The shadow wage rate factor for \nsurplus labor was estimated at 0.90 of the prevailing wage rate, reflecting the high level of \nactivity in the project area, and the shadow wage rate for scarce labor was estimated at 1.0. \nThese were adjusted by the standard conversion factor to derive economic values. All traded \ninputs and outputs were valued at their market prices. Financial investment costs, including \nphysical contingencies, have been converted to economic values by deducting taxes and duties \nand  applying  relevant  conversion  factors  to  the  various  investment  components  including \nforeign exchange costs, local currency costs, unskilled labor, and skilled labor.2 The resulting \nvalues represent the economic investment costs of the Project according to the world price \nnumeraire. The analysis is based on constant 2008 prices. The economic analysis has been \nconducted in accordance with the Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects of the Asian \n                                                 \n1\n The  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.93  is  based  on  the  economic  analysis  in  recent  ADB  reports  and \nrecommendations of the President, e.g., (i) ADB. 2006. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board \nof Directors on a Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region \nEnvironment Improvement Project. Manila; and (ii) ADB. 2007. Report and Recommendation of the President to the \nBoard of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Integrated Ecosystem and Water \nResources Management in the Baiyangdian Basin Project. Manila. \n2  Costs of the proposed extension to the WWTP were estimated based on a unit cost of CNY2,500 per cubic meter, \nwhich is in line with similar projects in the People's Republic of China. Taxes were assumed to account for 5% of \ncosts while the breakdown into foreign exchange, local currency, and unskilled labor was assumed to be the same \nas for the Project.  \n ", "  Appendix 11  49 \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). The detailed methodology and supporting tables for the analysis are \navailable in Supplementary Appendix K. \n \nB.   Demand Analysis \n3.  The population of Jiaozhou City was estimated to be about 891,800 in 2007,3 of which \nabout 230,000 lived in the project area. The population is estimated to be increasing at an \naverage annual rate of 1.12%. Based on local data, economic growth in the project area has \naveraged about 20% per annum in real terms since 2004over the past 3 years, which is well \nabove the national average, and this rapid growth is expected to continue in the intermediate \nterm, albeit with some gradual slowing as the economy develops. Immediate impacts of this \nrapid development have included (i) an increase in the incidence of flooding in the expanding \nurban areas, (ii) a high rate of waterborne disease incidence, and (iii) increasing environmental \ndamage to Jiaozhou Bay. While flooding was relatively rare in the 1990s, the incidence has \nsubsequently increased to about once in every 3 years with average damages valued in excess \nof CNY200 million per flood. As the economy continues to develop rapidly, the extent and value \nof  this  damage  is  expected  to  further  increase.  The  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases, \nparticularly stomach-related diseases, is estimated to be well above the national average and is \nexpected  to  increase  in  the  future  if  attention  is  not  given  to  wastewater  collection  and \ntreatment, and increased public awareness of personal hygiene. The current situation, where \nmuch wastewater is drained into open channels and the river network which traverses the \nproject area and permeates into the groundwater, is not conducive to overall development and \nreduced incidence of stomach and intestinal illnesses. In addition, the extent and quality of the \nwetlands in Jiaozhou Bay has seriously deteriorated over recent years and the annual rate of \nloss is currently estimated at about 0.9%. All of these factors are having a serious impact on \ncontinued local development and together contribute to a strong demand for remedial action. \nC.   Least-Cost Analysis  \n4.  Least-cost analysis was conducted to determine whether cost-effective water resources \nand environmental management measures have been proposed to achieve overall intended \ntargets of (i) improving flood retention facilities, (ii) upgrading the urban storm drainage network, \n(iii) rehabilitating river courses, and (iv) improving wastewater drainage facilities. Based on the \nfindings, further revisions of the preliminary design were investigated. The resulting proposed \ninvestments entail the least cost compared with alternative investment. Moreover, the proposed \ninvestments can be completed within the 5-year project implementation period. \nD.  Project Cost and Benefit Analysis   \n5.  Economic  Costs.  Financial  capital  costs,  including  physical  contingencies,  are \nconverted to economic capital costs by deducting taxes and duties, and then applying the \nrelevant conversion factors to the shares of local costs, unskilled labor, skilled labor, and other \ncosts. The resulting values represent the economic capital costs of the Project in world price \nnumeraire.  Annual  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  include  (i)  operating  costs  for \nproject investments in flood control, storm-water collection, river improvement, and wastewater \ncollection; and (ii) operating and maintenance costs for the WWTP extension to be financed \nfrom Government sources. \n6.  Economic Benefits. The Project will generate direct economic benefits from improved \nflood control and management, improved health, and reductions in the extent of environmental \n                                                 \n3  Jiaozhou City Government. 2007.

Due \nto the extent of road and pavement repair, as well as greening of the urban environment, there \nare expected significant direct and indirect benefits that can be attributed to these activities. \nHowever, no attempt is made to quantify these benefits due to the lack of data. \n7.  Currently,  in  the  without-project  situation,  Jiaozhou  City  experiences  frequent  flood \ndamage  caused  by  severe  siltation  and  poor  flood-discharge  capability  of  the  Yunxi  and \nHucheng rivers. This mainly affects industrial/commercial and private properties within the city \nproper, and from various Jiaozhou documents is estimated to occur once in 3 years. Based on \nthese data, the 2001 flood which caused CNY298 million of damage was estimated to represent \nthe 30-year return period flood. For the economic analysis, the damage caused to urban areas \n(the benefiting area) was extracted from the detailed flood information and adjusted to 2008 \nvalues. A further adjustment was made to reflect economic growth in the area since 2001, and \nalso economic growth that is expected to occur in future years. An estimate of the impact of the \n50-year return period flood was obtained from the flood simulation model, assuming a constant \nrelationship between flood depth and area flooded, and hence caused the damage. With point \nestimates of the expected financial value of flood damage for the 3-year, 30-year, and 50-year \nreturn period floods,4 the annualized financial benefit, in constant 2008 values, was estimated \nthrough a triangulation process at CNY96.6 million in 2011, increasing to CNY127.5 million in \n2021. The financial values were converted to economic values by applying a group conversion \nfactor of 0.94, which reflects the foreign exchange, local currency, labor, and tax composition of \nthe damage. The resultant economic values were CNY90.8 million in 2011 and CNY120.1 \nmillion in 2021. \n8.  Economic benefits from reduced disease incidence were estimated based on statistical \ndata from Jiaozhou and information collected in the socioeconomic survey. The main diseases \nincluded in the analysis are diarrhea, dysentery, gastroenteritis, and hepatitis A. Due to lack of \ndata,  stomach  and  intestinal  cancers  and  pollution-related  diseases  were  excluded.  The \nfinancial  cost  of  disease  incidence  was  estimated  as  the  total  of  the  cost  of  medical \nconsultations and treatment, including lost workdays of care providers who attend particularly to \nchildren and the elderly. Without the Project, the incidence of stomach illnesses was projected \nto increase from about 11,400 in 2009 to 50,200 in 2033. A 40% reduction in these diseases is \nexpected following project completion and the benefits are expected for both urban and rural \npopulations. With an economic cost for medical treatment of CNY613.80 per person per year,5 \nthe benefits are expected to increase from CNY0.75 million in 2010 to CNY12.35 million in \n2033. Economic benefits are also derived from the reduced losses in income either by the sick \npersons or those having to provide care particularly to the young and aged. This is estimated at \nabout CNY0.94 million in 2010 increasing to CNY15.5 million in 2033. Total health benefits are \nestimated at CNY1.7 million in 2010 increasing to CNY27.9 million in 2033. \n9.  The  premise  underlying  the  estimation  of  benefits  derived  from  strengthened  water \nresources  and  environmental  management  is  that  wastewater  production  and  disposal  in \nindustrial, rural, and urban communities will be effectively regulated and controlled, thereby \nsignificantly reducing exploitation of wetland resources and pollution loads being deposited into \nthe wetlands. This, in turn, is expected to reduce the continuing threat of human activities on the \nintegrity of the wetlands in the downstream Dagu River, and thereby save the natural wetlands \nfrom further degradation. In addition, implementation of the strategic environmental assessment \n                                                 \n4  The flood management structures were proposed to be designed up to the 50-year flood. Overdesign probably \nensures that they will protect against the 100-year flood but this additional benefit was not included in the analysis. \n5  Based on a financial cost of CNY660 converted to economic values using the standard conversion factor of 0.93. \n ", "  Appendix 11  51 \n(SEA) for Jiaozhou Bay is expected to have a significant longer-term impact on the wetlands as \nit increases awareness of degradation and provides a legal basis for reduction. Direct and \nquantifiable environmental benefits are both identified as direct uses (food production, raw \nmaterials, recreation, and cultural) and indirect uses (disturbance regulation, nutrient cycling, \nbiological control, and habitat/refuge). Of these, the main benefit is nutrient cycling for which \ndirect estimate of the benefit was made based on the cost of treating the total amount of \nwastewater currently produced to remove nitrogen and phosphorus, since this is the major \nsource of pollution of the wetlands. This was expressed in terms of the cost per hectare (ha) of \nwetlands. The values of other benefits were estimated using a benefit transfer approach based \non similar wetlands around Shanghai. The value of wetland benefits was projected to increase \nfrom CNY0.04 million (from 1.1 ha saved) in 2011 to CNY6.97 million (from 196.1 ha saved) in \n2033. There may be additional benefits from the improved status of the wetlands that are not \nlost, but these have not been included. \n10.  Economic Internal Rates of Return. Based on the identified benefits and costs, the \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the Project is estimated at 14.7%. The result indicates \nthat the Project as a whole is economically viable. \nTable A11: Economic Analysis \n(CNY million) \nProject Cost Economic Benefits\nOperation Reduced Reduced Total Net\nInvestment and Total Flood Health Wetlands Economic Economic\nYear Cost Maintenance Costs Damage Benefits Degradation Benefits Benefits\n2009        218.299 0.000              218.299 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000       (218.299)\n2010        393.332               5 .201              398.532 0.000                  1.683 0.000            1.683       (396.850)\n2011          74.807             1 0.401                85.208                90.759                  3.580                  0.039          94.378            9.170\n2012            2.049             1 0.401                12.450                98.538                  7.617                  0.156        106.310          93.860\n2013            1.292             1 0.401                11.693              103.230                  8.102                  0.347        111.679          99.986\n2014 0.000             1 0.401                10.401              105.197                  8.618                  0.651        114.466        104.064\n2015             1 0.401                10.401              107.200                  9.168                  1.027        117.394        106.993\n2016             1 0.401                10.401              109.242                  9.752                  1.397        120.391        109.990\n2017             1 0.401                10.401              111.323                10.373                  1.762        123.459        113.057\n2018             1 0.401                10.401              113.443                11.034                  2.123        126.601        116.199\n2019             1 0.401                10.401              115.604                11.738                  2.478        129.820        119.419\n2020             1 0.401                10.401              117.806                12.486                  2.829        133.121        122.720\n2021             1 0.401                10.401              120.050                13.282                  3.175        136.506        126.105\n2022             1 0.401                10.401              120.050                14.128                  3.516        137.694        127.292\n2023             1 0.401                10.401              120.050                15.028                  3.852        138.931        128.529\n2024             1 0.401                10.401              120.050                15.986                  4.184        140.220        129.819\n2025             1 0.401                10.401              120.050                17.005                  4.511        141.566        131.164\n2026             1 0.401                10.401              120.050                18.089                  4.833        142.972        132.570\n2027             1 0.401                10.401              120.050                19.242                  5.151        144.443        134.041\n2028             1 0.401                10.401              120.050                20.468                  5.464        145.982        135.581\n2029             1 0.401                10.401              120.050                21.772                  5.773        147.596        137.194\n2030             1 0.401                10.401              120.050                23.160                  6.078        149.288        138.886\n2031             1 0.401                10.401              120.050                24.636                  6.378        151.064        140.662\n2032             1 0.401                10.401              120.050                26.206                  6.674        152.930        142.528\n2033             1 0.401                10.401              120.050                27.876                  6.965        154.892        144.490\nEIRR = 14.66%\nNPV@ 12% = 119.202\n(  ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value.\nSource:  Asian Development Bank.  \n \nE.  Risk and Sensitivity Analysis \n11.  Sensitivity analysis shows that the project EIRR will fall (i) to 13.0% if economic benefits \nfall by 10%, (ii) to 13.3% if investment costs increase by 10%, (iii) to 12.6% if commissioning is \ndelayed for 1 year and 11.1% if delayed for 2 years, and (iv) to 11.7% if (i) and (ii) occur \ntogether. Sensitivity analysis is also tested for each benefit and indicated that flood benefits had \n ", "52  Appendix 11 \nthe greatest impact on economic viability. Sensitivity tests indicate that the returns to the overall \nProject are generally robust. Switching values indicated that the investment cost would have to \nincrease by 19.9% or overall benefits decrease by 15.0% for the Project to become nonviable. \nConsidered together, the change would have to be 9.1%. Even in the absence of any health \nbenefits or wetland environmental benefits, the Project would remain economically viable. \nF.  Distribution Analysis  \n12.  Distribution analysis involves the allocation of net economic benefits among the poor \nand non-poor in both rural and urban areas. The analysis shows that urban communities receive \nabout CNY11.1 million while rural communities receive CNY22.6 million. The economic cost to \nthe Jiaozhou city government is CNY54.7 million. Based on a poverty rate of 0.58% in urban \nareas and 4.80% in rural areas, the benefits to the poor are estimated at CNY0.06 million in \nurban areas and CNY1.09 million in rural areas, and the poverty impact ratio is estimated at \n0.06. \nG.  Financial Sustainability Analysis \n13.  Financial  sustainability  analysis  was  conducted  for  each  project  component  and  is \nincluded in Appendix 10.  \n \n ", "                                Appendix 12  53 \nENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Introduction \n1.  This environmental analysis summarizes the findings and recommendations from the \nenvironmental  assessment  carried  out  for  the  Qingdao  Water  Resources  and  Wetland \nProtection  Project.  The  Qingdao  municipal  government  (QMG)  and  the  Jiaozhou  city \ngovernment  (JCG)  requested  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  assistance  to  improve \nenvironmental  conditions  in  Jiaozhou  City,  the  newly  developed  Shaohai  Lake,  and  the \ndownstream area of Jiaozhou Bay wetlands. The Project aims to reduce flooding risks and \npollution loads, and to further strengthen the JCG environmental management capacity. The \nProject  will  also  serve  as  a  demonstration  project  for  sustainable  development  in  other \neconomic/industrial zones around the bay area.  \n \n2.  In accordance with the environmental assessment regulatory framework of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC), an environmental assessment was carried out for the proposed \nProject by the Jiaozhou Development and Reform Bureau.1 A first draft of the environmental \nassessment  report  was  completed  in  February  2008  and  submitted  to  the  Qingdao \nEnvironmental Protection Bureau (EPB) for appraisal on 18 March 2008. In the EPB appraisal \nmeeting,  representatives  and  leaders  from  Qingdao  EPB,  Jiaozhou  EPB,  and  Jiaozhou \nConstruction Bureau presented their comments on the environmental assessment report. The \npanel regarded the report as satisfactory to be used as a reference document for further project \nprocessing and approval. JCG updated the environmental assessment report based on EPB \ncomments  in  April,  continued  improvement  works  in  May  based  on  ADB  comments,  and \nfinished the second version of the report in May 2008.  \n \n3.  During  the  technical  assistance  implementation,  a  summary  initial  environmental \nexamination (SIEE) was prepared in accordance with the environmental assessment guidelines \nof ADB. The SIEE is based on the environmental assessment report for the Jiaozhou project \nand  includes  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  summarizing  the  main  mitigation \nmeasures, institutional responsibilities, and monitoring arrangements. The first version was \nfinished in April 2008. The SIEE was revised and finalized in July 2008 based on comments \nreceived from the Jiaozhou and Qingdao governments and key stakeholders, including ADB. \n \nB.  Project Description \n4.  The proposed Project will introduce an integrated approach to pollution control, water \nresources, and environmental management. The approach comprises an investment program \nand technical assistance2 to address key problems/constraints hindering effective management \nof water resources and the environment in the project area. The Project will be implemented \nover a period of 5 years from March 2009 to February 2014. The total project cost is estimated \nat $105.8 million. ADB will finance $45.0 million (42.5% of the total project cost). A summary of \nthe Project\u2019s four components is given below. \n \n \n                                                 \n1  The environmental assessment was carried out by the Ocean University of China, an Environmental Impact \nAssessment institute with class A certification. \n2  The proposed technical assistance aims to reinforce the goal of protecting environmental conditions in Jiaozhou \nBay and preserving wetland areas by strengthening both Qingdao\u2019s and Jiaozhou\u2019s integrated planning capabilities \nthrough the preparation/formulation of a strategic environmental assessment.   \n ", "54   Appendix 12 \n \nTable A12: Project Summary Matrix \nEstimated \nCosts \nProject Components  Performance Targets/Indicators  ($ million) \nComponent I: Improving Water Resources and Flood Management  73.2 \nFlood retention facilities  Existing Erli\u2019he flood retention facilities upgraded from 0.2 million m3 to 0.8  5.5 \nimproved.  million m3 by 2011. \nUrban storm drainage network  A total of 11.4 km of storm drainage pipelines installed by 2011.  14.4 \ninstalled/upgraded. \nMajor river courses  A total of 19.5 km of riverbanks upgraded/rehabilitated in four major rivers by  53.3 \nrehabilitated/upgraded.  2011.

Description of the Environment \n5.  Jiaozhou City is one of the county-level cities under the administration of Qingdao, \nlocated to the west of the main city of Qingdao and on the northwest coast of Jiaozhou Bay. \nJiaozhou City had a total area of 1,210 square kilometers (km2) and a total population of \n891,800 in 2007, of which 40% were residents in the main urban area. It is an important \nindustrial processing and warehousing logistics center based in the economic zone around \nJiaozhou Bay. \n \n6.  Rapid  urban  and  industrial  development  in  Qingdao  and  Jiaozhou  City  has  had \ndetrimental effects on its water resources and on the overall condition of the environment. In \nJiaozhou City, based on water quality surveys by Jiaozhou Environmental Monitoring Stations in \n2005, the water quality in the rivers passing through the main urban area are poor and are \nclassified as class V, with total phosphorus and chemical oxygen demand above the standards. \nMoreover, during the high-water season, flash floods frequently occur, while during the low-\nwater season, run-off is low with rivers often dry. In order to meet its sustainable development \nobjectives and targets, JCG and QMG are aware of the need to address these problems and \nstrengthen the capacity of the institutions that are mandated to manage water resources and the \nenvironment. They are also aware of the need for a comprehensive and integrated water \n ", "                                Appendix 12  55 \nresource and environmental management approach to address the complex and interrelated \nproblems as a requisite for sustainable economic development and improved quality of life \nwithin the Jiaozhou Bay area.  \n \nD.  Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n7.  Environmental  Benefits.  The  Project  will  mainly  have  environmental  benefits  and \nstrengthen the capacity of the Jiaozhou government to implement improved environmental \nmanagement practices. The river rehabilitation projects will reduce flooding risk, and thereby \nsignificantly improving public health. The wastewater interception and collection subcomponents \nwill significantly reduce direct pollution discharges to the rivers in Jiaozhou City. Water quality is \nanticipated to improve urban rivers, the newly constructed Shaohai Lake, the Dagu River, and \nthe downstream Jiaozhou Bay wetlands. As part of the nonstructural measures, the Project will \nalso provide technical assistance to the Jiaozhou government to improve its capacity to monitor \nand  control  pollution  in  the  entire  county.  Through  the  establishment  of  a  management \ninformation system, support for a \"wastewater group\" in the city government, and effective \ncoordination and guidance of the Project\u2019s leading group, it is anticipated that compliance with \nenvironmental standards will be increased and pollution loads will be reduced. \n \n8.  Impacts  During  Construction  Phase.  The Project will cause limited environmental \nimpacts during the construction phase. An estimated 1.8 million cubic meters of dredged sludge \nfrom the Erli\u2019he River Reservoir and the Yunxi, Hucheng, Wushui, and Sanli rivers will have to \nbe disposed of. Sediment sampling was undertaken during the environmental assessment for \nregular tests on heavy metal concentrations.3 The results showed that all monitored items are \nbelow the maximum permissible concentrations for neutral and alkaline soil of the Pollution \nControl  Standards  of  Sludge  Used  in  Agriculture  (GB4284-84).  Based  on  the  sludge \ncharacteristics, field utilization is proposed, which has been applied for years in Jiaozhou City \nfor river sludge disposal. In this Project, sludge excavation will be undertaken during the dry \nseason to reduce water contents and minimize environment impacts. Sludge from different \nrivers will be disposed separatelyarrange disposal specifically.  The sediment from the Yunxi \nRiver (east of Haier Avenue), the Erli\u2019he River, and the Sanli River can be used for farmland \naround Shaohai Lake. Sludge from the Yunxi River (west of Haier Avenue), the Hucheng River, \nand the Wushui River will be used in forest fields or for greening lands inside urban districts. \n \n9.  Limited negative impacts on soil, air, water, the acoustic environment, flora/fauna, and \nsurrounding communities are also expected during standard construction activities. The impacts \nwill be temporary and localized, and if proper mitigation measures are implemented during the \nconstruction period, the impacts can be minimized or eliminated. The residual impacts are \njudged to be insignificant. Similarly, construction activities have the potential to disturb cultural \nand/or historical sites, although none has yet been identified. A 2007 survey in Jiaozhou City \nindicates that cultural relics\u2014which are from Neolithic Age, Han Dynasty and Qing Dynasty\u2014\nare located outside the Jiaozhou urban city, mostly in rural towns surrounding the city. The \nimpacts  from  project  construction  and  implementation  on  the  cultural  relics  is  small  and \nnegligible,  if  any  existed.  To  mitigate  possible  risks,  contractors  will  protect  relevant  sites \nimmediately  and  report  to  local  culture  administration  agency  if  some  cultural  relics  are \nencountered, as described in article 32 of the Culture Relic Protection Law. \n \n                                                 \n3  Compared with Soil Environment Quality Standards (GB15618-1995), basically all the sludge samples can satisfy \nclass II standard, which is the level for guaranteed agriculture production and healthy growth of crops. Mercury in \nthe Wushui River and arsenic in the Yunxi River are higher than class II of GB15618. Sludge of Erli\u2019he River and \nSanli River is around class I standard of GB15618, which is the quality level for basic natural conditions. \n ", "56   Appendix 12 \n \n10.  Impacts During the Operation Phase. Environmental impacts during the operation \nphase  have  been  identified  and  addressed  in  the  project  design.  As  major  parts  of  the \nwastewater collection, infrastructure will be combined with storm-water,consist of a combined \nsystem,  sewer  overflows  will  occur  during  heavy  rainfall.  While  diluted  sewage  may  be \ndischarged directly to the river systems, impacts are minimized by the higher dilution in the \nrivers during the wet season. The noise impact from the operation of two pump stations is \nnegligible. The collected wastewater will require adequate treatment. Although the wastewater \ntreatment plant (WWTP) is not financed through the Project, JCG has ensured that the capacity \nof the existing Jiaozhou WWTP will be expanded and that all wastewater will be treated to a 1B \nlevel4 prior to discharge into the Dagu River.  \n \n11.  Due Diligence. The development of the Shaohai Lake and the required expansion of the \nWWTP have been identified as \u201cassociated impacts to be assessed\u201d with the Project and a due-\ndiligence review has been carried out. The development of the Shaohai Lake, the key to \nimproved  flood  and  water  quality  management,  was  started  in  2004.  The  approved \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  report  has  been  reviewed  and  it  is  considered  that \nenvironmental impacts were addressed adequately. For the wastewater to be collected by the \nProject, proper treatment has been assured by JCG through its commitment (project covenant) \nto expand the capacity of the existing WWTP and improve the quality of the treatment process \n(to 1B level). Moreover, JCG will monitor and ensure, through the support of the Project, that all \nindustrial establishments will apply pre-treatment to comply with national regulations. Similarly, \nJCG has provided proof that the sludge from Jiaozhou WWTP is safely disposed of. Since 2008, \nthe sludge has been sent to the Qingdao Diendi Biological Technical Company and processed \ninto plant fertilizers through biological degradation and harmless treatment. \n \n12.  Cumulative  Impacts. No cumulative impacts have been identified for the proposed \nproject activities. \n \n13.  Environmental Management Plan. An environmental management plan (EMP) has \nbeen prepared to (i) agree on appropriate mitigation measures, and (ii) guide the establishment \nof institutions or mechanisms to monitor and ensure compliance with environmental regulations \nand implementation of the proposed mitigation measures. The EMP describes (i) objectives, (ii) \na summary of potential impacts, (iii) mitigation measures, (iv) environmental monitoring, (v) \nplanned  public  consultation,  (vi)  responsibilities  and  authorities  for  implementation,  (vii) \ninstitutional strengthening and training, (viii) reporting and supervision, (ix) a work plan, (x) \nprocurement and cost estimation, and (xi) a mechanism for feedback and adjustment. The EMP \nwill be reviewed and updated at the end of the detailed design in order to be consistent with the \nfinal detailed design. \n \nE.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring \n14.  Executing Agency. JCG, being the Executing Agency, will be responsible for the overall \nimplementation and compliance with the EMP and monitoring plan. JCG will ensure that, as part \nof standard project monitoring arrangements, environmental monitoring reports will be submitted \nto ADB on a semi-annual basis. JCG will also be responsible for handling any disputes arising \nfrom noncompliance with the EMP.  \n \n15.  Project Management Office. A project management office (PMO) has been established, \ncomprising 10 staff from the Jiaozhou City Construction Bureau, including the project manager, \n                                                 \n4 Discharge standard of pollutants from municipal wastewater treatment plant (GB18918-2002). \n ", "                                Appendix 12  57 \nstaff for procurement, disbursement, engineering, and social and environmental safeguards, \nand interpreting. The PMO will have overall responsibility for supervising implementation of \nenvironmental mitigation measures and reporting to ADB. It will be responsible for the day-to-\nday implementation and compliance with the EMP and ensuring that mitigation measures are \nimplemented as described in the EMP, and will support the Executing Agency in handling any \ndisputes  arising  from  noncompliance  with  the  EMP.  The  PMO  will  provide  the  periodic \nenvironmental  monitoring  reports  to  JCG  and  ADB.  On  completion  of  the  Project,  the \nwastewater entity under the Jiaozhou City Construction Bureau will be responsible for the O&M \nof the wastewater networks, drainage, and river courses management. \n \n16.  Project Leading Group. To increase project effectiveness, a project leading group, \nestablished by the Jiaozhou Government, will provide general oversight and coordination over \nthe project implementation. The leading group is headed by the vice-mayor of Jiaozhou City, \nand includes members from the Jiaozhou Development and Reform Bureau, Jiaozhou Finance \nBureau, Jiaozhou Water Resource Bureau, Jiaozhou Environment Protection Bureau, Jiaozhou \nLand  Resource  Bureau,  Jiaozhou  Construction  Bureau,  Jiaozhou  Planning  Bureau,  and \nJiaozhou People Bank.  \n \n17.  Environmental  Monitoring  Arrangements.  The  PMO  will  nominate  at  least  one \nqualified  full-time  environmental  management  staff  member  to  undertake  environmental \nmanagement and monitoring activities. The PMO will further engage a construction supervision \nconsultant to assist in carrying out environmental management monitoring activities, prepare \nsemi-annual progress reports, report to ADB, and conduct necessary training. On behalf of the \nGovernment, the Qingdao EPB/Jiaozhou EPB will delegate environmental monitoring to the \nQingdao Environment Monitoring Center/Jiaozhou Environment Monitoring Centers.  \n \n18.  Reporting Schedule. The PMO, with the assistance of project consultants, will monitor \nand  assess  overall  project  activities  under  the  project  design  and  monitoring  framework, \nincluding environmental targets. The PMO will submit to ADB the EMP progress reports and \ninformation on project implementation and the environmental performance of the contactors. \nThese reports will include (i) semi-annual environmental reports on EMP implementation, and \n(ii) environmental compliance monitoring and audit report of the completion of each subproject.  \n \n19.  Monitoring Costs. The costs for the implementation of the monitoring plan during the \nconstruction phase is minimal, estimated at CNY120,000 over a period of 4 years. The annual \ncosts for monitoring during the operation phase will be approximately CNY40,000/year. These \ncosts have been included in the project cost tables. \n \nF.  Public Consultations and Disclosure \n20.  Public Consultations. Two rounds of public consultations and information disclosure \nwere conducted in January and February 2008. The consultations focused on project-affected \npeople in Shinan Community, Yunxi New Village, Yunxi Street Administration Office, Zhongyun \nStreet Administration Office, and Fuan Street Administration Office. A questionnaire survey was \nconducted  among  project-affected  people  living  in  Dongguan  Street,  Lanzhou  Street, \nShimenshou Street, Longzhou Street, and Lanzhou West Street. More than 87% of interviewed \npeople live within 2 kilometers of the proposed Project. Being dissatisfied with current water \nquality, and eager to solve the existing problems of environmental pollution, 98.2% of the total \ninterviewed people agreed with the construction of the Project, and expressed their expectations \nthat  the  Project  will  bring  significant  environmental  benefits.  During  the  consultation,  local \ncommunities  also  expressed  concerns  regarding  possible  adverse  impacts  during  the \n ", "58   Appendix 12 \n \nconstruction phase, and would like construction agencies to take suitable measures to mitigate \nthe impacts. \n \n21.  Disclosure. Disclosure of project information was carried out in two rounds on 14 March \n2008 and early April 2008. The project scope, environmental impacts, and mitigation measures \nwere posted on the Jiaozhou government's website5 www.jiaozhou.gov.cn. In addition, (i) the \nSIEE will be made available for review on ADB's website before consideration of the Project by \nthe ADB Board; (ii) copies of the full environmental assessment report will be made available on \nrequest; (iii) all environmental monitoring reports will be provided to the Qingdao EPB/Jiaozhou \nEPB and ADB; and (iv) a formal grievance redress committee will be established to answer \npublic complaints as discussed in former sections. \n \nG.  Findings and Recommendations \n22.  The  Project  will  have  positive  environmental  impacts  by  reducing  flooding  and \nassociated pollution and health hazards in Jiaozhou urban city. The Project will significantly \nimprove water quality in the urban rivers and Shaohai Lake. By assuring that all wastewater \ncollected by the Project will be treated to a class IB level through an expansion of the existing \nJiaozhou WWTP, JCG will reduce overall pollution loads on the Dagu River and Jiaozhou Bay. \nComplemented by improved environmental management capacity, the Project is expected to \ninitiate sustainable planning process, contribute to halting the degradation of the wetland areas \nin Jiaozhou Bay, and contribute significantly to improved water quality in the bay. \n \n23.  Potential adverse environmental impacts during both construction and operation periods \ninclude  unsafe  disposal  of  dredged  sediments  and  WWTP  sludge,  and  limited  standard \nconstruction  impacts.  All  these  impacts  have  been  analyzed  in  the  project  environmental \nassessment report and SIEE. Specific environmental mitigation measures will be undertaken to \nminimize the adverse impact. No further studies are considered to be necessary. \n \n24.  Extensive community consultation indicated that most of the affected people have a \npositive attitude towards the Project and that they believe it will benefit the local environment, \nliving standards, and economic development. Negative opinions on the Project focused on \nlocalized  noise,  odor,  and  air  pollution  associated  with  the  construction  phase.  The \nenvironmental mitigation measures have been developed to address these specific concerns. \n \nH.  Conclusion \n25.  The proposed Project will have significant positive environmental impacts in the project \narea, including enhanced urban flood prevention in Jiaozhou City and improved water quality of \nurban  water  bodies,  the  Shaohai  Lake,  and  the  downstream  Jiaozhou  Bay  wetlands.  The \nproposed  strategic  environmental  assessment  will  enable  JCG  and  QMG  to  introduce \nsustainable approaches to urban development, thus protecting and maintaining the functions of \nthe coastal wetlands and ecosystems. Based on the results of the SIEE, the Project will not \ngenerate significant environmental impacts, provided the mitigation measures are implemented \nappropriately. \n \n                                                 \n5 Available: http://www.jiaozhou.gov.cn/jzoa/jiaozhou/zwgg/zwgg/200804/5753.html.  \n ", "                                                                                                                                                          Appendix 13               5  9 \n \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY   \n \nCountry/Project Title: People\u2019s Republic of China/Qingdao Water Resources and Wetland Protection Project \n \nLending/Financing  Department/  East Asia Department/ \nProject Loan \nModality:  Division:  Agriculture, Environment, and Natural Resources Division \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe goal of the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan (FYP 2006\u20132010) is to build a \nharmonious society. To achieve the goal, the Government aims for a balanced development strategy that builds a harmonious \nsociety and a socialist market economy that is energy-efficient and environmentally friendly. In the FYP, a number of \nenvironmental and natural resources concerns are given priority, which include, among others (i) land degradation, (ii) water \nshortage and pollution, (iii) poor urban environmental infrastructure, (iv) degradation of marine ecosystems and wetlands, (v) \nincreasing frequency and intensity of environmental accidents, and (vi) global environmental issues such as climate change \nand greenhouse gas emissions. The Chinese Communist Party and the State Council issued a series of policy directives on \nenvironmental protection for the 11th FYP period. These policy directions are incorporated into the National Economic and \nSocial Development Master Plan  which was developed in March 2006. This plan gives priority to (i) protection and \nrehabilitation of valued ecosystems; (ii) increasing efforts in pollution control; (iii) improving natural resource management; \nand (iv) sustainable utilization of marine/water resources. As a guiding policy for the 11th FYP, the State Council directive sets \nforth two broad environmental objectives for the next 5\u201315 years. By 2010, the environmental quality of key regions and cities \nwill be improved, and the trend of ecological degradation will be arrested. By 2020, the quality of the environment and the \nstate of the country\u2019s ecosystems will have improved significantly. There are many other specific targets set under 11th FYP \nbut the reduction in energy intensity by 20% and total pollution loading by 10% are the two most prominent. \nIn accordance with the PRC\u2019s FYP, the Asian Development Bank's (ADB\u2019s) country partnership strategy for PRC 2008\u20132010 \nemphasizes inclusive growth through balanced development and environmental sustainability. ADB, as per its long-term \nstrategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020), will pay greater attention to poverty reduction, management of natural \nresources  and  ecosystems,  and  increasing  its  investment  in  natural  resources  management,  agriculture,  and  rural \ndevelopment.  \nThe proposed Qingdao Water Resources and Wetland Protection Project (the Project) supports ADB\u2019s strategic priorities. \nWith rapid urban development and population growth, severe pollution of water resources as well as frequent flooding have \nbecome  key  constraints  to  sustainable  development  in  Qingdao  Municipality  and  Jiaozhou  City.  While  various  water \nconservation  and  management  projects  have  been  implemented  by  the  Government  in  recent  years,  there  are  still \nopportunities  to  improve  environmental  management  in  the  area.  The  Project  aims  to  bring  tangible  benefits  to  the \nenvironment of Jiaozhou Bay area by (i) reducing water pollution; (ii) protecting water resources; (iii) reducing economic \nlosses and disruption to livelihoods from frequent localized flooding; (iv) enhancing wetland ecosystems in both Shaohai Lake \nand  the  Dagu  Estuary/Jiaozhou  Bay  wetlands;  (v)  promoting  sustainable  economic  development;  (vi)  improving  the \nenvironment, living conditions, and public health standards; and (vii) improving public service delivery through corporatization \nand improved financial sustainability. The poverty and social analysis shows that the Project will contribute to (i) reduced \nsurface and groundwater pollution; (ii) reduced risks of exposure to waterborne and vector-borne diseases, with associated \nreduction in medical costs and number of workdays lost; (iii) increased employment opportunities and income-generation \nactivities from temporary job creation during the construction period and permanent job creation during the operation period; \nand (iv) decreased flood-associated damages and economic losses. The expected outcome is improved condition of water \nresources and environment in Jiaozhou and the downstream wetlands. Its impact is improved quality of life, a sustainable \necosystem, and biodiversity conservation in Jiaozhou Bay. The project impact will be enhanced by the replication of project \nlessons to other newly developed zones within Qingdao municipal government territory by the implementation of a strategic \nenvironmental assessment as an integral part of strategic planning of future economic development in the Jiaozhou Bay area. \nThe Project will benefit directly about 370,000 people living in the project area, of whom about 1.5% are poor.  \nThe Project will also assist the PRC\u2019s progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goal 7, target 10, to halve by 2015 \nthe proportion of people without access to basic sanitation, by increasing coverage of the Jiaozhou public service systems \nincluding urban drainage to serve an estimated 370,000 people by 2010 and 450,000 by 2015. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1.    Key Issues  \n \nCurrently, 34 poor counties and more than 2.3 million people in Shandong province are living below the rural poverty line of \n ", "60   Appendix 13 \n \nCNY1,000 per capita per annum. Qingdao City in Shandong Province, however, is a rapidly urbanizing municipality, and the \nper capita annual net income of urban and rural residents is greater than that of both the PRC and Shandong Province. The \nQingdao 2006 Statistics Yearbook shows that per capita annual net income of rural residents was CNY6,546, and per capita \nannual disposable income of urban residents  was CNY15,328. The poor population  who had been supported by the \nGovernment\u2019s livelihood subsidy program\u2014those living on CNY1,500 per capita per annum in rural areas and CNY3,600 per \ncapita per annum in urban areas\u2014 numbered 106,637, or 1.42% of the total population in the city. In Jiaozhou City, the rural \nand urban minimum livelihood subsidy standards are set at CNY1,500 per capita per annum for rural areas and CNY2,880 per \ncapita per annum for urban areas. Those who were entitled to this subsidy totaled 10,493, or 1.5% of the total population in the \ncity.  \n \nThe socioeconomic survey showed that most of the urban poor are unemployed workers, part-time workers, the disabled, the \nelderly, and retirees. The cause of urban relative poverty groups are low income from employment (68.1%), illness (12.1%), \nlack of knowledge or skills (12.1%), insufficient labor (4.3%), and others (3.4%). This unemployment is usually due to lack of \nemployment opportunities and income resources. \n \n2.     Design Features  \n \nThe Project has incorporated two key features to benefit the poor. First, to mitigate the financial burden of the poor from \nincreased wastewater collection tariffs due to service improvement, the Project has negotiated with the Government that \nsubsidies will be provided to poorer families. Second, the Project will provide 75% of the jobs generated in the Project to \nvulnerable groups including the poor and women. It is expected that the Project will generate about 3,400 jobs during the \nconstruction period. To maximize the project benefits, women will be given priority in the employment and training opportunities \ngenerated in the Project\u2019s construction and operation phases. \n \nThe Project is also expected to have the following positive effects on the poor: \n(i)  Improving the living environment. The Project can improve the living environment of poor families by providing better \nwastewater collection and cleaning up the polluted rivers.  \n(ii)  Reducing incidences of waterborne diseases. The Project will improve hygiene and drinking water problems, \nthereby reducing the incidence of waterborne diseases. Poor families often ignore minor illnesses, at times even the \nmajor ones, due to financial constraints. The Project can reduce incidences of waterborne diseases and guarantee the \nbasic living standard of poor families. \n(iii)  Poverty-relief effect. The Project is expected to reduce natural disaster (flooding) associated damages, providing a \nguarantee to the poor population\u2019s housing and finance. \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.   Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nA poverty and social analysis was undertaken in line with ADB guidelines to collect detailed social information necessary to \ninform project design, and identify poverty reduction and social development objectives, outcomes, and indicators. The poverty \nand social analysis identified vulnerable groups, opportunities for pro-poor interventions and recommended social action \nmeasures, and participation and mitigation plans to achieve positive social benefits. \nThe Project will provide improved public services to residents in Jiaozhou. The direct social benefits include improved \ncleanliness and health, reduction in incidence of disease, increased job opportunities, and flooding control. However, the main \nsocial risks are identified, such as poor families being unable to afford the service of basic infrastructure and facilities such as \nwastewater services, and less ability to cope with pollution and a degraded environment. They often suffer from wastewater \npollution and poor urban environmental sanitation, which in turn increase their exposure to water pollution. This may put them \nat high risk of diseases related to water pollution such as diarrhea, hepatitis, and respiratory diseases. Thus, the Project will \nprovide equal benefits to poor people through reduced (or free) wastewater treatment charges. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.    Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nThe poverty and social assessment utilized a number of participation processes to solicit the input of a cross section of \nstakeholders.  Stakeholder  analysis  was  conducted  during  the  poverty  and  social  assessment.  Various  methods  and \napproaches have been conducted, including 400 households  sampling socioeconomic survey, stakeholder consultation \nmeetings and workshops, eight focus group discussions, and 103 key informant interviews. The main stakeholder groups are \nurban residents, women, poor people, enterprise owners, and local decision makers including relevant government agencies at \ncounty/committee levels, project management office, project implementation agencies, and the private sector. Formulation of \nthe short resettlement plan utilized separate socioeconomic surveys, community meetings, opinion surveys, and specific \nimpact studies in May 2008. \n \nAdditionally, three rounds of public consultations in the project areas were carried out to prepare the environmental impact \nassessment, social assessment, and the short resettlement plan. The public consultations and information disclosure included \n ", "                                                                                                                                                          Appendix 13               6  1 \n(i) introducing the project components to the stakeholders; (ii) collecting ideas, suggestions, comments, concerns, and critiques \non the potential environmental implications of the Project; and (iii) presenting the findings of the environmental impact \nassessment, social assessment, and short resettlement plan, summarizing potential environmental impacts and mitigation \nmeasure, and providing answers raised by workshop participants. The participation will be carried out throughout the whole \nprocess of the resettlement plan, environmental impact assessment, and environmental management plan implementation. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \nPublic consultation and participation, which have been key elements of the project design, will continue during project \nimplementation, monitoring, and evaluation. Ongoing consultations will be carried out by the implementing agencies to (i) meet \nthe evolving needs and expectations of the users, (ii) increase the awareness of the public about the benefits of the Project, (iii) \nencourage the active involvement of local communities to maximize their support for the Project, (iv) promote environmental \nprotection, and (v) raise the social acceptance of tariff increases. Moreover, measures to actively involve communities have \nbeen established in the design. Community-based monitoring team is planned to be set up to help project construction \nlaborers\u2019 selection, environmental protection awareness education, coordination with other stakeholders, reflect their views on \nthe project implementation, etc. The Project will provide CNY20,000 for the local residents to establish and conduct monitoring \nactivities.  \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, consultant \ninput, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nIt is expected that the following results will be achieved through the C&P: (i) increased participation of local population in the \nproject implementation and monitoring, (ii) increased awareness of project benefits and acceptance of the Project, (iii) \nincreased hygiene knowledge and reduced incidence of waterborne and vector-borne diseases, and (iv) increased participation \nof beneficiaries affected by this Project. Furthermore, stakeholder consultation and disclosure of information will be conducted \nthrough  environment  management  plan,  resettlement  plan,  and  social  development  action  plan  during  the  project \nimplementation and operation.   \n \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nWomen are often the ones who are more negatively impacted by water than men, as they take care of household chores and \nchildren. The health benefit would be greater to women, the elderly, children, and the poor as they are most vulnerable to \nstomachache  such    diseases.  Women,  with  more  chances  of  contact  with  water  from  domestic  chores,  will  benefit \ndisproportionately from the improvement of urban drainage faculties.  \n \nA target of 30% for women\u2019s employment in operation and maintenance of infrastructure has been set, plus an assurance from \nthe project managements office to encourage contractors to hire as much female construction labor as possible. Men stand to \nbenefit more than women from the unskilled construction jobs that will be created through the Project, due to the requirement \nfor physically  demanding labor. However, there is no  constraint to women\u2019s participation in the skilled operation and \nmaintenance work which will be created, as evidenced by the number of women already working in these sectors and the equal \nnumbers of male and female graduates with technical qualifications. There are also requirements for consultation with women \nin the resettlement plans. \n \n2.  Key Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and \nuse of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n    Gender plan          Other actions/measures         No action/measure \n \nSummarize key design features of the gender plan or other gender-related actions/measures, including performance targets, \nmonitorable indicators, resource allocation, and implementation arrangements. \n \nAppropriate participation and consultation is appreciated by women, and is more likely to lead to longer-term support and \nsuccess of the technical inputs. Women in the community will be actively engaged for the public education and awareness \nprogram to promote hygiene education, a garbage recycling program, and social acceptance of tariff increase. For the public \neducation and awareness program, the Project will work closely with local women\u2019s organization such as women association \nand  women\u2019s  street  committee. The  short  resettlement  plan  and  environmental  management  plan  will  include  gender \ndisaggregated data, where relevant. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "62   Appendix 13 \n \nIII.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION \n \nAre social indicators included in the design and monitoring framework to facilitate monitoring of social development activities \nand/or social impacts during project implementation?     Yes        No      \n \n ", "         Appendix 14   63\n \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n1.  The Qingdao Water Resources and Wetland Protection Project consists of three physical \nsubprojects: (i) Improvement of Flood Retention Project in Erli\u2019he Reservoir, (ii) Upgrading of Urban \nStorm-water and Wastewater Drainage Project, and (iii) River Course Rehabilitation Project. These \nsubprojects  will  not  only  increase  the  storage  capacity  of  reservoirs  and  enhance  the  flood \ndischarge capacity of watercourses, but will also improve the drainage system and control the \nwatercourse pollution.  \n \n2.  According to the resettlement investigation, impacts related to the project resettlement \ninclude (i) people affected by the permanent acquisition of land, (ii) people affected by permanent \noccupation of informal farmland along the river banks, and (iii) people affected by the temporary \noccupation of state-owned land. A total of 2.80 hectares (ha) of collective land will be acquired, of \nwhich 0.75 ha (26.8%) is farmland and 2.05 ha (73.2%) is pond; 15 households with 51 persons \nare affected. About 3.25 ha of informal farmland along the river banks or inside the existing \nreservoirs/ponds used for seasonal crops are affected, which involves 60 households with 212 \npersons. Also, 9.93 ha of state land (i.e., roads, sidewalks, or boulevards) will be temporarily \noccupied for laying wastewater and storm-water pipelines. There is no demolition of residential \nhouses or shops, and there is no vulnerable or ethnic minority group involved in this Project (Table \nA14.1). Local officials, leaders from subdistricts and villages, and the affected persons were closely \nconsulted during the feasibility study stage in order to avoid or minimize land acquisition and \nresettlement. \n \nTable A14.1: Summary of Resettlement Impacts \nPermanent  Temporary  Temporary \n       \nLand  Crops  Land \nName of  Name of  Household Population \nAcquisition  Occupation  Occupation \nSubproject  Subproject  Affected  Affected \n(mu)a  (mu)  (m2) \nThe pond of Area \n  0    0    0    0    0 \nErli\u2019he Water  1 \nRetention  The pond of Area \n  30.8    1    0    3    11 \nReservoir  2 \nProject  The pond of Area \n  0    5    0    11    42 \n3 \nErli\u2019he River    0    0    0    0   \nYunxi River    0    41    0    38    133 \nRiver Course \nRehabilitation Hucheng River    0    0.2    0    2    4 \nProject \nWushui River    0    1.5    0    0    0 \nSanli River    11.3      0    21    73 \nUrban  Wastewater \n  0      63,889     \nSewage and  pipeline \nDrainage  Stormwater \n  0      35,419     \nProject  pipeline \nTotal    42.1    48.7    99,308    75    263 \na   Fifteen Chinese \u201cmu\u201d equals 1 hectare. \n Source: Resettlement Plan by Jiaozhou city government, 2008. \n \n3.  As  the  resettlement  impacts  are  not  significant,  a  short  resettlement  plan  has  been \nprepared on the basis of the Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB). All affected persons will be eligible for compensation and assistance. The cut-off date \nfor eligibility for compensation and assistance under the Project will be the date that the Jiaozhou \nmunicipal  government  approves  the  resettlement  plan,  and  will  be  announced  to  all  affected \n ", "64   Appendix 14 \npersons immediately afterward. Once the detailed designs of the subprojects are finalized, the \nresettlement plan will be updated and submitted to ADB for approval. \n \n4.  Due  diligence  was  required  for  the  previous  resettlement  impacts  caused  by  the \nconstruction of East Lake (Shaohai), since this is a part of the Project which was constructed prior \nto ADB involvement. The due-diligence report has been prepared to evaluate the resettlement \nresults, compensation and rehabilitation measures, and present conditions of the affected persons. \nThe due-diligence report shows that the compensation and rehabilitation measures are in line with \nnational and local policies on resettlement, and affected persons are satisfied with the resettlement \nactivities. There are no remaining issues on resettlement in the Shaohai East Lake Development \nProject. \n \n5.  For people who will be unavoidably affected by the Project, the resettlement objective is to \nachieve equal or better income and living standards, in line with the national laws and local \nregulations, as well as ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy. Consulting with local governments \nand affected persons, the Jiaozhou city government (JCG) as the Executing Agency (EA) adopted \na set of compensation standards based on the replacement cost and general practice in the project \ndistricts and counties. The resettlement principles established for the Project are: (i) wherever \nfeasible, land acquisition and involuntary resettlement will be avoided or minimized through the \ndevelopment of design alternatives and the choice of the best alternative; (ii) compensation and \nentitlements provided will be based on market value or replacement value and must be adequate \nto allow those affected to maintain or improve their pre-project standard of living; (iii) temporary \nland occupancy and the period of disruption are to be kept to a minimum; (iv) all the people \naffected, whether legal or non-legal residents, are to be taken into consideration and accounted \nfor;  (v)  where  the  landholding  per  capita  is  not  enough  to  maintain  the  previous  livelihood \nstandards, other income-generating activities will be provided for; (vi) vulnerable groups will be \ngiven preference in matters such as compensation and employment; (vii) all those affected will be \nadequately informed about eligibility, compensation rates and standards, livelihood and income \nrestoration plans, and project timing; and (viii) close monitoring and timely actions will be carried \nout to identify and resolve problems as they arise. The affected persons will be compensated and \nresettled in a timely and adequate manner in accordance with the resettlement plan so that they \nwill be made better off, or at least not worse off, than they would have been without the Project. \n \n6.  With regard to land acquisition, the compensation standard is determined by consulting with \nthe affected villages whose land will be acquired. Land compensation for farmland is 10 times of \nthe average annual output value,1 and resettlement subsidy for farmland is 14 times the average \nannual output value. A land compensation and resettlement subsidy will be paid to the affected \nvillage committees, while young crops compensation will be paid to individuals. To restore the \nincome losses, the following measures will be implemented during the resettlement process: (i) the \nvillage  committee  will  adjust  the  remaining  land  within  the  whole  villages;  (ii)  the  land \ncompensation and resettlement subsidy will be deposited in banks for income earnings or welfare \nfrom interest, such as distributing rice, flour, and edible oil to all villagers; (iii) land compensation \nwill  be  used  for  basic  social  insurance  for  the  land-lost  farmers;  (iv)  secondary  and  tertiary \nindustries will be developed or expanded to generate employment opportunities and recover the \nincome of the affected persons, and technical training will be provided to the affected persons to \nteach them nonagricultural skills; and (v) the project EA will give the affected persons priority to be \nemployed in the activities during the project construction and operation. \n \n7.  With regard to the loss of access to informal farmland which does not legally belong to \nfarmers, the affected persons will be informed 6 months prior to civil works to stop planting \ntemporary crops along the river banks, or paid one-season young crops compensation. Moreover, \n                                                 \n1 The average annual output value of 2005, 2006, and 2007 is CNY1,600/mu in the affected areas, as per the Jiaozhou \nStatistical Bureau. \n ", "         Appendix 14   65\nskill training programs and employment will be provided for family laborers to help integrate these \naffected persons into urban society. \n \n8.  For businesses or residents that may be temporarily affected or inconvenienced by the \nconstruction of the wastewater and storm-water network, mitigation measures are also provided to \navoid or minimize the potential impacts during the construction period. Most construction impacts \nwill last less than 1 month; if impacts last longer, compensation will be negotiated between the EA \nand  the  affected  businesses  or  residents.  Other  mitigation  measures,  such  as  disclosing \nconstruction information, setting warning signs, and prohibiting construction schedules, will be \nimplemented. \n \n9.  The JCG, as the EA, will assume the overall responsibility for resettlement. The Jiaozhou \nproject management office (PMO) will take charge of resettlement compensation payment and \nsupervision. The PMO will also coordinate the planning, implementation, financing, and reporting of \nland acquisition and resettlement progress to ADB. \n \n10.  The cost of land acquisition and resettlement is included in the overall budget of the Project, \nwhich is estimated to be CNY2.8 million. The project owners will pay compensation and other fees \nto the affected villages and individuals through the PMO with domestic counterpart capital. To \nensure that land acquisition and resettlement can be finished successfully, the PMO has set up \nvarious financial and supervising organizations for funds management at different levels. \n \n11.  The affected persons were fully consulted and informed during the preparation of the \nresettlement plan. Local representatives participated in planning meetings, interviews, focus group \ndiscussions, public consultation workshops, and community consultations, and their comments and \nconcerns are integrated into the resettlement plan. The draft resettlement plan was distributed to \nthe affected subdistricts and villages in July 2008, and resettlement information booklets were \ndisseminated to the affected villages and affected persons on 3 September 2008. The grievance \nredress procedures are well established; they are explained in the resettlement plan and referred \nto in the resettlement information booklets. \n \n12.  The resettlement plan implementation will be subject to internal and external monitoring, as \ndescribed in the resettlement plan. The EA will supervise the implementation and monitor the \nprogress  quarterly  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  provisions  of  the  resettlement  plan.  Each \nresettlement  agency  within  the  EA  will  undergo  capacity  building  during  land acquisition and \nresettlement; the resettlement staff training programs and budgets are included in the resettlement \nplan.  The  PMO  will  entrust  an  independent  agency  with  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  activities  twice  a  year,  and  external  monitoring  reports  will  be \nforwarded directly to the PMO and ADB. \n \n13.  The resettlement implementation schedule is based on the overall project preparation and \nconstruction timetable. The process of land acquisition is scheduled to begin in the second half of \n2009  and  be  completed  by  the  end  of  the  year.  Before  land  acquisition,  the  detailed  land \nacquisition plan and agreements required under the PRC regulations will be approved by Jiaozhou \nLand Resources Bureau, after negotiation with and acceptance by the affected persons. If there \nare  any  significant  changes  in  land  acquisition,  resettlement  impacts,  or  entitlement,  the \nresettlement plan for this Project will be updated to reflect the changes, and the changes will be \ndisclosed to the affected persons and submitted to ADB for approval before land is acquired or civil \nworks commence. The PMO and EA have agreed on a set of supervision milestones with ADB for \ntimely and effective resettlement (Table A14.2).  \n \n \n \n ", "66   Appendix 14 \nTable A14.2: Resettlement Supervision Milestones \n \nNo.  Resettlement Tasks  Target  Responsible Agency  Deadline  Status  \nA.
