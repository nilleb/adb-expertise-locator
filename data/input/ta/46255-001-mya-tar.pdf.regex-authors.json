INTRODUCTION \n1.   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  in  the  preliminary  stages  of  reengaging  in \neconomic policy advice and capacity development with the Government of the Republic of the \nUnion of Myanmar. ADB adopted a three-phased process of reengagement with Myanmar in \nearly 2012: phase I\u2014preparation of initial economic and sector assessments as an extension of \nwork  done  under  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  Program;  phase  II\u2014conduct  of \ncomprehensive sector assessments, capacity and institutional support, and project preparation; \nand  phase  III\u2014resumption  of  lending  operations,  subject  to  satisfactory  progress  in  the \ncountry\u2019s engagement with the international community and clearing of its arrears. ADB has \ncompleted phase I and is moving toward phase II by preparing for technical assistance (TA) \noperations focused on capacity building, institutional strengthening, and project preparation. The \nTA is fully aligned with and supports the Myanmar interim country partnership strategy, 2012\u2014\n2014.1In  particular,  it  supports  the  program  areas  of  (i)  building  human  resources  and \ninstitutional capacities in ADB core operational areas, and (ii) creating access and connectivity \nfor rural livelihoods and infrastructure development. It also links into selected thematic and \ncrosscutting areas of the Myanmar interim country partnership strategy. \n \n2.  The government has requested capacity development TA to support its economic reform \nagenda,  identify  viable  investment  projects,  and  initiate  preliminary  steps  to  prepare  pre-\nfeasibility studies for these projects. The TA is designed to support key sector ministries to \noutline a methodology for prioritizing selection of potential projects, identify feasible investment \nprojects, and initiate the preparation of pre-feasibility analysis of pilot projects in these sectors to \nimprove their capacities using practical tools and methodologies. The sectors included in the TA \nhave been selected according to government priorities and the potential for ADB support, based \non  preliminary  needs  assessments,  strategies,  and  road  maps.  ADB  sector  teams  had \ndiscussions with participating ministries from April to September 2012 to agree on the scope of \nthe TA. The government concurs with the impact, outcome, outputs, and key activities as \npresented  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  in  Appendix  1.2 This  TA  complements \nanother capacity development TA,  which provides advisors and training for government officials \nto identify sector needs and improve policies and institutional development in key ministries.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The government has instituted wide-ranging reforms as part of the ongoing economic, \nsocial, and political transformation. Major initiatives include the unification of the exchange rate, \na new investment law, monetary and financial sector reforms, and changes to the trade union \nlaw.  The  government  has  also  initiated  the  process  to  identify  and  address  policy  and \ninstitutional issues at the sector level, with the support of ADB and other development partners. \nThese reforms are essential in establishing a sound macroeconomic national policy framework \nand developing efficient institutions and policies. However, they are not sufficient to ensure the \nachievement of Myanmar\u2019s development objectives. There is a need to simultaneously improve \nthe capacities of government officials and ministries to develop methodologies and practical \ntools that allow them to identify and prepare viable investment projects. Macroeconomic and \nsector-specific reforms need to be implemented in parallel with viable investment projects that \nprovide  tangible  benefits  to  the  population.  Projects  must  be  identified,  prepared,  and \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2012. Interim Country Partnership Strategy: Myanmar, 2012\u20142014.

Manila. \n ", "2  \nimplemented using efficient methodologies and mechanisms that respect environmental and \nsocial concerns, maximize economic benefits, and ensure financial sustainability. \n \n4.  Among the sectors that are expected to play a strategic role in Myanmar\u2019s development, \nthis TA will focus on transport, energy, agriculture and natural resources, and water supply and \nother municipal infrastructures and services. These sectors have been identified based on the \nexpressed  priorities  of  the  government  and  the  results  of  the  preliminary  assessments, \nstrategies, and road maps conducted by ADB staff 4. The government is making great efforts to \nimprove performance in these areas and to address many issues confronting these sectors, \nincluding (i) improving organizational structures, (ii) clarifying institutional responsibilities among \nand within sector agencies, (iii) developing long-range strategic sector planning to prioritize \npublic  investments,  (iv)  updating  policies  and  regulations,  and  (v)  improving  capacity  for \nperforming  policy  and  regulatory  functions.  However,  all  these  reforms  will  have  to  be \naccompanied  by  specific  investment  projects  that  deliver  concrete  results.  After  years  of \nisolation,  sector  ministries  have  limited  experience  in  project  identification,  design, \nimplementation, and evaluation. This has resulted in insufficient provision of infrastructure and \nlow  levels  of  access  to  services.  There  is  an  urgent  need  to  assist  line  ministries  in  the \nidentification  of  viable  projects  and  to  improve  their  capacities  for  the  preparation  of  pre-\nfeasibility studies for investment projects, which will use modern appraisal techniques, including \neconomic and financial analyses, efficient procurement systems, environmental analysis, and \nother safeguard measures. Specific issues for each of the four priority sectors identified are \ndescribed below. \n \n5.  Transport. The government has constructed a highway to link Yangon, Nay Pyi Taw, \nand Mandalay and has built many bridges in the country. However, Myanmar\u2019s transport sector \nis underdeveloped for a country of its size, population, and potential. It is characterized by high \ntransport costs and the absence of a sufficiently extensive lower level road network, restricting \nthe access of much of the population to economic and social opportunities. The government is \nworking to improve core sector issues, including (i) consolidating fragmented and overlapping \ninstitutional  structures  for  managing  development  of  the  sector;  (ii)  developing  an  overall \ntransport sector strategy; (iii) improving capacity in sector agencies; and (iv) increasing the role \nof the private sector. A key issue that requires urgent support is the development of a more \nrigorous approach to select transport infrastructure investments and to prepare and implement \nroad projects, using modern and efficient techniques. Capacity development support is also \nrequired to mitigate the potential adverse environmental and social impacts of the transport \ndevelopment through increased movement of people and goods, including the prevention of HIV. \n \n6.  Energy. Despite abundant energy resources and recent efforts by the government to \ndevelop energy resources, Myanmar has one of the lowest levels of energy consumption in \nSoutheast Asia because of its low per capita income and inadequate energy infrastructure. The \nelectrification ratio is low (26%) and system losses are high (27%). Persistent power supply \nshortages exist in Yangon and Mandalay; and existing power generation, transmission and \ndistribution, and gas pipeline networks are inefficient and poorly maintained. The government \nintends to look at options to improve its fragmented institutional structure, which results in weak \ncoordination and planning (e.g., there are no long-term energy supply and demand projections). \nHowever, other important sector issues include (i) difficulty in generation and transmission \nplanning  and  operation  and  maintenance  caused  by  the  absence  of  electric  performance \nstandards and a unified power grid code; (ii) weak experience in preparing feasible projects; and \n(iii) outmoded and inefficient legal safeguard requirements.  \n                                                 \n4 ADB. 2012. Myanmar in Transition: Opportunities and Challenges. Manila. ", "3 \n \n \n7.  Water  supply  and  other  municipal  infrastructure  and  services.  The  rate  of \nurbanization in Myanmar is relatively small compared to many other members of the Association \nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), with urban development being dominated by Yangon and \nMandalay. The government has recognized the need to develop (i) a coherent framework to \nharness private sector participation in urban development programs, projects, and activities; \n(ii) adequate  policy  and  strategic  guidance  at  the  central  and  local  levels;  and  (iii)  clear \ninstitutional  roles  and  responsibilities  for  planning,  management,  and  regulation.  However, \nchronic underinvestment in urban infrastructure, particularly in water supply and sanitation, has \nresulted in the lack of and/or poor quality of services, which can only improve if the policy and \ninstitutional reforms initiated by the government are accompanied by the identification and \npreparation of viable investment projects. \n \n8.  Agriculture and natural resources. The government has implemented reforms since \n2002 to increase private sector participation and productivity in the agriculture sector and has \nbuilt several dams to manage water resources. However, the full potential of agriculture for \ncontributing  to  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  has  not  been  realized,  despite  its \ndominant role in Myanmar\u2019s economy. Physical constraints (lack of access to markets and \ninputs, inadequate access to irrigation facilities, and substantial deficiency in the provision of \nelectricity to rural areas) and policy-related factors (unattractive producer prices, high cost of \nfarm inputs such as fertilizer, lack of access to credit, outmoded land tenure system, and poorly \ndeveloped  research  and  extension  system)  have  obstructed  agricultural  development  in \nMyanmar. Core sector issues on which the government is starting to work, with support from \nADB and other development partners, include (i) a clearer definition of the role, functions, and \nresponsibilities of the departments within the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation; (ii) better \ncoordination and an improved water-based natural resources management; (iii) expansion of \nresearch and agriculture extension services; and (iv) increased level of access to rural finance. \nHowever, these reforms must be coupled with the identification and development of viable rural \ndevelopment projects that deliver concrete benefits to the rural population.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  impact  will  be  the  successful  processing,  implementation,  and  monitoring  of \ninvestment projects in four sectors in line with stipulated standards. The outcome will be the \nimproved  capacity  of  the  participating  ministries  to  identify  and  prepare  projects.  The \nconsultants will work with government officials in the ministries to transfer knowledge and skills. \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  Four outputs are envisaged for the TA with key activities as follows:  \n \n11.  Output 1: Viable projects for the transport sector identified.

Output 4 \nincludes the following activities: (i) outlining a methodology for prioritizing and selecting potential \nrural development projects; and (ii) conducting two pre-feasibility studies, for community-based \nrural development projects in the Delta region and in the dry zone.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.765 million, of which $1.500 million will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources).  The \ngovernment  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office \naccommodation, and other in-kind contributions. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 2. The government has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit \nADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n16.  The Ministry of National Planning and Economic Development (MNPED) will be the \nexecuting agency. A subcommittee will be formed by the government, comprising senior officials \nfrom the participating ministries.5  The subcommittee will provide coordination for TA activities \nand be a forum for exchanging good lessons in capacity development for project identification, \nprioritization, and formulation across ministries. A TA focal point in each participating ministry \nwill provide administrative support for the conduct of all activities. ADB will attend subcommittee \nmeetings as an observer. \n \n17.  International and national consultants will be recruited by ADB in accordance with its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time).
