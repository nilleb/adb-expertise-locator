INTRODUCTION \n1.  During  the  2013  country  programming  mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide technical \nassistance  (TA)  for  Improving  the  Legal  Framework  for  Securities  and  Futures  Markets.1 \nFollowing a reconnaissance mission in January 2014, and a fact-finding mission in May 2014, \nADB and the government reached an understanding on the objectives, scope, implementation \narrangements, costs, and terms of reference for the TA. The design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Financial  law  includes  acts  regarding  banking,  securities,  insurance,  negotiable \ninstruments, trusts, futures, investment funds, and debt securities. These laws play substantial \nroles in supporting the stability of the financial system, development of a market economy, and \nindirectly building the economic well-being of citizens of the PRC. The government has placed \nhigh priority on efforts to create a multilevel capital market, encourage financial innovation, \nstrengthen the financial infrastructure to ensure safe and efficient operation of financial markets, \nand ensure financial stability. All these objectives require the existence of relevant and up-to-\ndate supporting laws and regulations. The most urgent tasks regarding financial legislation in \nthe PRC are the modification of the Securities Law, 1999, and the adoption of a futures law. \nThese laws will be the focus of the TA. \n  \n3.  The  PRC\u2019s  bond  market  is  the  largest  among  emerging  economies  in  Asia,  with \ngovernment bonds heavily dominating issuance. The amount of outstanding domestic currency \nbonds in the PRC market reached CNY26.4 trillion ($4.3 trillion)  at the end of September \n2013\u2014more than a tenfold increase from $342 billion at the end of 2002. Six major types of \ninstruments are traded: (i) Ministry of Finance-issued government bonds; (ii) Central Bank bills; \n(iii) financial  bonds  issued  by  government-backed  policy  banks  and  financial  institutions; \n(iv) corporate bonds issued by domestic corporations comprising either enterprise bonds issued \nby state-owned enterprises for infrastructure projects or corporate bonds issued by corporations \nlisted on the stock exchanges; (v) commercial paper, issued by either securities firms or private \ncorporations; and (vi) medium-term notes issued by private corporations. The credit rating \nsystem in the PRC has five major domestic rating agencies, including two foreign joint ventures, \nsupporting the growing corporate bond market. The PRC\u2019s stock market has grown rapidly and \nis the second largest in the world in terms of market capitalization, at about $3.7 trillion at the \nend of 2012. The PRC has two stock exchanges (Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen \nStock Exchange) and a national over-the-counter market (National Small and Medium-sized \nEnterprise Share Transfer System), established in 2013. \n \n4.  The  Securities  Law  was  passed  in  December  1998,  effective  July  1999,  and \ncomprehensively revised in 2005. The present law is formulated to regulate the issuance and \ntrading of securities, protect the rights and interests of investors, safeguard the economy and \nthe  public  interest,  and  promote  market  practices.  Securities  markets  in  the  PRC  have \ndeveloped rapidly since 2005, both in financial products and trading platforms. With this growth, \ngaps in oversight have appeared as a result of outdated legal provisions. The 2008 financial \ncrisis identified weaknesses in securities laws globally. Many countries revised their securities \n                                                \n1  The TA is included in ADB. 2014. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2014\u20132016. \nManila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 21 May 2014. \n ", "2   \nlaws to limit the impact of crises in the future. Among other areas internationally, key changes \nconsidered improvements in consolidated supervisory oversight, corporate governance, and \ntransparency, curtailing practices that added to financial instability such as short selling, and \nbetter supervision of previously under-regulated activities such as over-the-counter derivatives. \nThe PRC\u2019s Securities Law requires amendment to meet financial system changes, new product \ndevelopments, and current services and market structures. Issues to be considered may include \nreforming registration and initial public offering requirements, clarifying investor protections, and \nenhancing rights for retail investors, among other areas. \n \n5.  The  PRC  has  four  futures  exchanges:  Zhengzhou  Commodity  Exchange,  Dalian \nCommodity Exchange, Shanghai Futures Exchange, and China Financial Futures Exchange. \nThe exchanges deal in various financial, metals, energy, and agricultural products. A vast \nvariety of new products are traded on these exchanges, and their activities are expanding \nrapidly.  Over-the-counter financial,  interest  rate,  currency,  and  credit derivatives  have  also \ndeveloped  significantly.  While  a  futures  market  can  play  an  important  part  in  economic \ndevelopment and the financial system, only an administrative ruling issued by the State Council \nregulates this market; no comprehensive Futures Law is in place. \n \n6.  Drafting work on an amended securities law began in December 2013, with staff from \nthe branches of the National People\u2019s Congress (NPC) of the PRC and the State Council. The \nplan is to deliver a draft of the amended securities law at the end of 2014 for first reading by the \nStanding Committee of the NPC. A draft of the futures law is expected to be delivered by the \nend of 2015 for first reading by the Standing Committee of the NPC. \n \n7.  The TA will provide inputs to support the review of the draft revised securities law and \nthe draft of a new futures law. These inputs will be used in the legislative process to prepare for \nthe first and subsequent readings of the laws by the Standing Committee of the NPC. Work on \nthe securities and futures laws has already been listed on the 5-year lawmaking plan of the \nStanding Committee of the 12th NPC. The TA directly supports the process to enable up-to-date \nand complete legislation to facilitate development of the financial system. It builds on prior ADB \nwork on legislation, including the Law and Policy Reform Program in the PRC from 1998 to \n2003 that facilitated the development of commercial and economic laws.3 The program resulted \nin adoption of the first securities law, trust law, company law (amendment), bankruptcy law; and \nlegal adjustment relating to antidumping, countervailing duties, safeguards, import and export of \ngoods, foreign trade law, and cross-border merger and acquisition, upon accession to the World \nTrade Organization. The TA is also related to the ongoing TA for Developing a Legal System for \nthe Credit Market and Capacity Building of the Capital Markets\u2019 Regulatory System.4 \n \n8.  The TA is closely aligned with the Mid-Term Review of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, which \nidentifies finance as one of ADB\u2019s core areas of operations.5 In ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy for the PRC, 2011\u20132015, the first pillar is inclusive growth and improving access to \nfinance as a key activity to promote inclusive growth.6 This TA supports access to finance by \n                                                \n3  ADB. 1998.

THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be a more efficient, innovative, and stable financial market better serving \nthe  real  economy.  The  outcome  will  be  updated  legal  frameworks  to  support  continued \nexpansion and innovation in securities and futures markets, integrating a balanced approach \nbetween financial stability and financial innovation. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The outputs will support the review of the draft revised securities law and the drafting of \na new futures law by the Economic Law Department of the Legislative Affairs Commission (LAC) \nunder the Standing Committee of the NPC. The integrated comments will be presented to the \nStanding Committee of the NPC for the first and subsequent readings of the laws. The outputs \nwill be two diagnostic reports for each topic, in interim and final versions, and ad hoc sub-\nreports. Reports will include domestic and international assessments, and recommendations. \nThe final diagnostic reports will incorporate any commentary received after public disclosure \nand the first reading of the laws. \n \n11.  The first report will provide a review of the domestic securities markets and a review of \nglobal best practices in securities regulation. It will also provide recommendations on the draft \namendment to the existing Securities Law. The second report will provide a review of the \ndomestic futures market and a review of global best practices in futures regulation. It will also \nprovide recommendations on the new draft law. The TA will review domestic conditions and \npractices, and compile global best practices that are appropriate for the PRC. The review of the \ndomestic  market  will  assess  gaps  in  the  existing  legal  structure  to  encompass  current \ndevelopment of the securities and futures markets. The assessments will involve outreach to \nrelevant  stakeholders,  surveys,  and  workshops.  Various  ad  hoc  sub-reports  will  also  be \nprepared as needed throughout the project, with comments to be incorporated in the interim and \nfinal reports. The themes for these ad hoc reports will be identified during the project as needed \nand will address key questions that require specific commentary. A knowledge product will also \nbe produced that outlines the current state of securities and futures market laws and regulations, \nand recommendations to support further market development in the PRC. \n \n12.  Two  domestic  workshops  will  be  held,  addressing  securities  and  futures  market \nconditions and needed legal reforms. Experts will be invited to present ideas at the workshops \nand provide feedback on legislative proposals and recommendations. The review of global best \npractices will focus on the experiences of developed countries that have securities and futures \nmarkets with advanced instruments, practices, and regulations. The markets will include those \nwith a diverse range of financial products and commodity instruments, and advanced legal \nsystems and trading infrastructures. As no international conference is planned for the TA, a \nstudy tour will be used to establish working relationships with government expert counterparts in \ndeveloped countries. The countries to be visited in the tour will be identified after consultation \nwith the international consultants and during the assessment of global best practices. The tour \nwill allow for in-depth discussions with staff and professionals in developed markets that have \ndirect and practical experience with futures and securities markets, laws, and regulations. These \nrelationships  with  international  experts  will  be  used  to  help  incorporate  practical  global \n ", "4   \nexperiences into draft laws and amendments, and provide for ongoing communication by the \nLAC even beyond the time frame of the TA. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $330,000, of which $300,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, transportation, and \nother in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The LAC will be the executing agency, and the Economic Law Department of the LAC \nwill be the implementing agency. \n \n15.  One  international  consultant  for  6  person-months  and  two  national  consultants  for \n11 person-months in total will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Proceeds will be disbursed in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). Consultants will be experts in financial law regarding securities and futures activities. An \nadvance payment facility will be used for the study tour, training, seminar, and conference \nadministration by the LAC. \n \n16.  The TA will be monitored and evaluated based on the implementation of activities and \nsatisfactory delivery of outputs following the agreed time line and budget. To support monitoring \nand evaluation, consultants will submit inception, interim, and final reports in English. Final \nreports will also be delivered in Chinese. TA review missions will be used to aid in monitoring \nprogress, as will regular communication with the LAC and consultants. The knowledge product \nwill be distributed by the LAC to public and private sector stakeholders that participated in the \nproject and be made available widely on the ADB website.  \n \n17.
