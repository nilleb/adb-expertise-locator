The Project is not expected to have significant adverse \nAssessment  environmental  impacts.  A  summary  of  the  initial  environmental \nexaminations (IEEs) conducted for the Project is provided as a core \nappendix. Full environmental assessment documents for subprojects \nin  the  three  countries  and  environmental  assessment  and  review \nprocedures for Bangladesh are in a supplementary appendix. \n   \nProject Description  The Project will develop and improve tourism-related infrastructure in \n  Nepal, India, and Bangladesh. It will focus on improving connectivity to \nand destination infrastructure and services in key nature and culture-\nbased  tourism  sites  on  selected  high-priority  subregional  circuits. \nInfrastructure  interventions  will  include  airport  upgrading,  last  mile \nroad connectivity, environmental improvements of destinations, such \nas water supply, sanitation, and solid waste management; and visitor \nmanagement infrastructure and services. The physical interventions \nwill  be  accompanied  with  a  program  of  capacity  building  in  each \ncountry to develop the capacities of sector agencies for sustainable \nprotection and management of natural and cultural heritage of tourism \nimportance. Moreover, the Project will implement a program in each \ncountry to better engage local communities in tourism to enhance the \neconomic  linkages  between  local  populations  and  tourism,  and \nincrease benefits from tourism to the subregion\u2019s communities.  \n   \nRationale  South  Asia,  particularly  the  area  which  contains  Nepal,  north  and \nnortheastern states of India, and Bangladesh (the subregion), is one of \nthe poor regions of the world. However, the subregion has vast and \ndiverse  cultural  and  natural  resources  and  contains  many  of  the \nworld\u2019s major Buddhist sites, which potentially position it as a world \ndestination for nature and culture-based tourism.  Tourism plays a vital ", "ii \n  role in the subregion\u2019s economy. During 1999 to 2006, international \ntourist arrivals grew at an average rate of 8%, higher than the world \naverage.  In 2007, tourism earnings from international visitors totaled \n$12.3 billion, representing a 150% increase from 2003; and tourism \ndirectly employed 13.76 million people in the three countries (including \nall of India). Tourism in the subregion, however, remains constrained \nby (i) inadequate connectivity and destination infrastructure; (ii) weak \nprotection and management of heritage assets of tourism importance, \nwhich threaten the environmental and cultural sustainability; and (iii) \ninadequate community engagement. Together these limit the growth \nprospect  and  ability  of  tourism  to  significantly  contribute  to  the \neconomy and poverty reduction. The Project is required to address the \ninfrastructure  and  management  deficiencies,  and  foster  community \nparticipation  in  nature  and  culture-based  tourism  by  supporting \nintegrated development of priority destinations in high-potential circuits \nof subregional importance. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The Project will promote sustainable and inclusive growth in South \nAsia  through  tourism  infrastructure  development  that  will  tap  the \neconomic potential of contiguous and complementary tourism assets \nof Nepal, India, and Bangladesh. The impact will be reflected as an \nincrease in the contribution of tourism to the subregion\u2019s economy and \nemployment  opportunities,  including  local  livelihoods.  The  Project \noutcome  will  be  several  key  tourism  circuits  (of  subregional \nimportance)  of  nature  and  culture-based  destinations  with  (i) \nenhanced  connectivity,  (ii)  better  quality  environment  and  visitor \nservices, (iii) improved natural and cultural heritage and capacities for \nheritage  management,  and  (iv)  greater  community  engagement  in \nheritage management and tourism benefits.  \n   \nProject Investment  The  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $89.5  million, \nPlan   including taxes and duties of $7.35 million. The project cost for the \n  Nepal  component  is  $46.5  million;  for  the  India  component  $28.0 \nmillion; and for the Bangladesh component $15.0 million. \n   \nFinancing Plan  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide to Nepal a loan of \nSDR8,234,000  ($12.75  million  equivalent)  from  its  Special  Funds \nresources with a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, \nand  with  an  interest  charge  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace \nperiod  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  A  grant  of  $12.75  million \nequivalent from ADB's Special Funds resources will also be provided \nto Nepal. The Government of Nepal will provide $6.0 million equivalent \nas  counterpart  funds  and  the  OPEC  Fund  for  International \nDevelopment will provide $15.0 million as cofinancing to finance part \nof the Nepal component of the Project. \n ", "  iii \n  A  loan  of  $20.0  million  equivalent  from  ADB's  ordinary  capital \nresources will be provided to India under ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 25-\nyear  term  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB's London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per \nannum, and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft \nloan agreement. The Government of India will provide $8.0 million as \ncounterpart funds. \n \n  A loan of SDR7,698,000 ($12.0 million equivalent) from the Special \nFunds resources of ADB will be provided to the People's Republic of \nBangladesh, with a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 \nyears, and with an interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.

A  national  project \nsteering  committee  will  be  established  in  each  country  to  provide \npolicy guidance and oversee project implementation.  \n \nIn Nepal, a project coordination unit will be formed in the Ministry of \nTourism  and  Civil  Aviation  to  undertake  overall  monitoring  and \nprogress  reporting  of  activities  of  project  management  and \nimplementation units to be set up in the two implementing agencies, \ni.e., Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal and the Lumbini Development \nTrust.  \n \n  In India, a project management and implementation unit will be set up \nin the Sikkim State Department of Tourism that is designated as both \nproject executing and implementing agency.  \n \nIn Bangladesh, similarly a project management and implementation \nunit  will  be  set  up  in  the  Department  of  Archaeology,  the  project \nexecuting and implementing agency. \n   \nProcurement  Goods  and  services  financed  by  ADB  and  the  OPEC  Fund  for \nInternational Development will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nInternational  competitive  bidding  procedures  will  be  used  for  civil \nworks contracts estimated to cost $10.0 million or more in India, $2.0 \nmillion or more in Bangladesh, and $1.0 million or more in Nepal; and \nfor supply contracts valued at $1.0 million or higher. The upper limit for \ncivil  works  to  be  procured  through  national  competitive  bidding \nprocedures will be less than $10.0 million in India, $2.0 million in \nBangladesh, and $1.0 million in Nepal; and for equipment the upper \nlimit  will  be  $1.0  million.  Shopping  will  be  used  for  contracts  for \nprocurement of equipment and simple civil works worth $100,000 or \nless.  \n   \nConsulting Services  Teams of international and national consultants will be engaged to assist \nin managing and implementing the Project in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). Services will be required in the areas of project management, \ndetailed design, supervision, community participation, environmental \nand  social  safeguards,  project  performance  monitoring,  heritage \nplanning  and  management,  ecotourism,  airport  engineering, \ninstitutional development, and financial management. A total of 935 \nperson-months consulting services is expected to be required for the \nProject; 417 person-months (30 person-months international and 387 \nperson-months national) for Nepal; 333 person-months (12 person-\nmonths international and 321 person-months national) for India; and \n185 person-months (25 person-months international and 160 person-\nmonths national) for Bangladesh.  \n   \n ", "v \nProject Benefits and  The increased tourist arrivals, length of stay, and expenditure as a \nBeneficiaries  result of project interventions will enable each country to earn more \nforeign  exchange,  generate  additional  jobs,  and  improve  total \neconomic output. Preservation and effective management of natural \nand cultural heritage sites will help ensure continued benefits from the \nassets  into  the  future.  Improved  environment  and  infrastructure  in \ndestinations  will  enhance  the  experience  of  tourists  and  the  living \nconditions and public health of communities living in and around the \nsites.  Enhanced  air  and  road  connectivity  to  the  new  tourism \ndestinations in Nepal, Bangladesh, and India will benefit tourists while \nimproving access and mobility of local residents living around these \ncurrently isolated locations. \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  approach,  which  favors  expanding  existing  tourism \npatterns into remote areas and concepts like \u201cgreater Himalayan trail\u201d \nor \u201cvillage tourism,\u201d will help spread tourism benefits to communities \ncurrently bypassed by tourism markets. Inclusive approaches will be \nreinforced by special efforts to raise awareness and develop skills of \ncommunities to increase tourism livelihood opportunities. \n    \nThe Project is expected to benefit an overall 2.4 million people through \nincreased  income,  employment,  and  health  and  environmental \nimprovements; and reduced travel time. About 270,000 people will \nbenefit from additional employment in the tourism industry and related \nindustries. At least 5,000 local livelihoods will be created improving the \nlives  of  nearby  communities.  Capacity  development  activities  will \nequip around 250 practitioners with skills for enhanced protection, \nmanagement, and marketing of key destinations in the three countries.\n   \nRisk and  The major risks of the proposed Project are related to (i) lower than \nAssumptions  expected market demand for the tourism destinations and passenger \narrivals for Gautam Buddha airport, (ii) sustainability of heritage sites \nand tourism assets created, (iii) suboptimal benefits to local people \nfrom  enhanced  heritage  and  tourism  growth,  and  (iv)  poor  project \nimplementation performance resulting in delays and timely accrual of \nbenefits. The Project addresses these risks through various measures. \n \nThe conservative assumptions used in assessing the tourism market \nand passenger demands for the sites will mitigate the risk for lower \nthan expected market demand. Moreover, the Project will support a \nmarketing and promotion program for the sites and circuits developed \nto ensure that the projected market demand will materialize.    \n \nRisk  for  sustainability  of  the  heritage  sites  will  be  mitigated  by  (i) \nimproving  the  protection,  environment,  and  visitor  infrastructure;  (ii) \nenhancing  capacity  of  public  sector  site  managers;  (iii)  supporting \npreparation and implementation of management plans for the heritage \nsites; (iv) gaining community support for heritage management through \nawareness  programs;  and  (v)  implementing  revenue  generation \nreforms to create sustainable sources of funds for managing the sites.  ", "vi \n  The Project will ensure that tourism will not bypass the communities. \nIts approach and concept to expand current tourism patterns to remote \ndestinations will help spread tourism benefits more widely. Community \nawareness  programs  on  potential  benefits  from  tourism  will  be \nconducted.  The  Project  will  support  community  training  and  skills \ndevelopment, as well as schemes for village tourism and heritage-\nbased tourism livelihood generation. Where available, the services of \nnongovernment  organizations  or  other  development  partners  with \ncompetence  in  similar  programs  will  be  sought  for  effective \nengagement of communities in tourism.     \n \nThe  risk  of  slow  project  implementation  will  be  mitigated  by \nestablishing project coordination units and project management and \nimplementation units as efficient units with qualified staff supported by \nproject  management  and  design  consultants.  Moreover,  a  regional \ntechnical assistance commencing before the project effectiveness in \neach country will provide an up-front support to the project agencies in \nundertaking  project  start-up  activities,  recruiting  consultants,  and \npreparing the detailed design of first batch subprojects. \n ", "1 \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) proposed \nloans to Nepal, India and the People's Republic of Bangladesh, (ii) a proposed grant to Nepal, \nand (iii) proposed administration of a loan to be provided by the Organization of Petroleum \nExporting Countries (OPEC) Fund for International Development (OFID) to Nepal for the South \nAsia Tourism Infrastructure Development Project. The design and monitoring framework for the \nProject is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  South Asia is one of the poor regions in the world. Poverty is concentrated in the \nnortheastern  part  of  the  region,  including  Nepal,  the  northeastern  states  of  India,  and \nBangladesh (the subregion). However, the subregion is endowed with vast and diverse cultural \nand natural resources that give it the opportunity to build a globally competitive tourism sector. \nThe subregion has an ancient cultural heritage of more than 5,000 years old, and is home to \nmany natural and cultural heritage sites inscribed in the World Heritage List. The subregion \ncontains the world\u2019s highest mountain, the eastern Himalayan range. It has a rich diversity of \nethnic groups with distinctive cultures. The subregion is also home to the \u201cBuddhist heartland\u201d \n\u2014an area that contains many of the world\u2019s major Buddhist sites.  \n \n3.  In Nepal, Lumbini, the birthplace of Buddha is the icon of the Footsteps of the Lord \nBuddha circuit. The circuit follows the chronological steps of Buddha\u2019s life, and links with the \nBuddhist attractions of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar states of India appealing to the growing number \nof international Buddhist pilgrims and spiritual tourists. The Footsteps of the Lord Buddha circuit \nis the jewel in the crown of Buddhist circuits that justifies the \u201cBuddhist heartland\" label for the \nsubregion. The Sacred Garden in Lumbini, where Buddha was born, is inscribed as a World \nHeritage site due to its outstanding universal value.  \n \n4.  In India, the Sikkim state, which is strategically located at the center of the subregion, \nhas  spectacular  and  picturesque  nature,  and  is  home  to  the  well-known  Kanchendzonga \nnational park with hundreds of species of flora and fauna. The state also has a rich Buddhist \nheritage, including the world-renowned Rumtek Monastery which attracts visitors from all over \nthe world. Sikkim is only 2 hours drive from the Indian city of Bagdogra, i.e., the subregional \nhub,  with  existing  and  potential  links  to  Bangladesh,  Nepal,  and  Bhutan.  Located  on  the \nHimalayas, Sikkim forms part of the greater Himalayan trail1 \u2014a development concept as well \nas a physical trail that extends the full length of the Himalayas through Nepal, India and Bhutan; \nlinking the popular destinations with remote valleys.  \n  \n5.  Bangladesh, despite its relatively limited international recognition, has a very rich cultural \nheritage. The heritage sites concentrated along a corridor from north to south in the western \nregions of Bangladesh are especially important, and have existing and potential links to the \nnortheast region of India in the north and West Bengal of India in the south. The corridor forms \npart of a potential multi-country circuit called the Bangladesh India Cultural Heritage Highway \ncircuit.  The  four  heritage  sites  along  the  Bangladesh  Heritage  Highway  have  outstanding \nuniversal cultural value and are popular visitor attractions among Bangladesh\u2019s 391 cultural \nheritage sites. Paharpur, a world heritage site, is the single largest Buddhist Monastery built in \nthe 8th century. Kantajee is the largest Hindu terracotta temple in the world. Mahastangarh is an \n                                                 \n1  Greater Himalayan Trail was first proposed by The Mountain Institute and trekking entrepreneurs, and was included \nin the 2004 South Asia Tourism Strategy as one of the key concepts and priority areas for development. ", "2   \nancient Buddhist city which is about to be inscribed in the World Heritage List. Bagerhat, \nanother world heritage site on the southern part of the corridor, is a splendid mosque complex \nwith a 77 domed mosque and eight other mosques nearby.   \n \n6.  According to World Travel & Tourism Council statistics, during 2000\u20132007, international \ntourist arrivals in Nepal, India (northeastern states), and Bangladesh grew at an average rate of \n8% reaching almost double the global average of 4.8%. Total international arrivals were about \n5.7 million in 2007, representing a 73% increase from 2000. In 2007, tourism earnings from \ninternational  visitors  totaled  $12.3  billion,  representing  a  150%  increase  from  the  tourism \nearnings of 2003, and tourism directly employed 13.76 million people in the three countries \n(including all of India). Growth in the region has been fuelled by India. While international \narrivals  to  Bangladesh  and  Nepal  have  fluctuated  in  2000\u20132006,  demand  has  improved \nmarkedly in 2007 with an estimated increase in arrivals of at least 6% for Bangladesh and 20%, \nfor Nepal.   \n \n7.  As for the specific culture and nature-based attractions of the region, a more specific \nanalysis carried out under project preparatory technical assistance (TA)2 suggests that Lumbini \nin Nepal currently receives an estimated 500,000 annual visitors, including 71,000 international \ntourists.  Sikkim  State  in  India  receives  an  estimated  210,000  tourists  including  18,000 \ninternational tourists. The cultural attractions of the Bangladesh Heritage Highway are estimated \nto receive 370,000 visitors annually including 36,000 international visitors. The key international \nmarkets include the regional market segments of Thailand, Republic of Korea, Japan, the \nPeople's Republic of China, the European countries of the United Kingdom, France, Germany \nand Italy; and the United States of America, Canada, and Australia.         \n \n8.  Available data suggest that tourism is a multicountry activity in the region. Considerable \nnumbers of international visitors combine several countries for their visit. A recent exit survey in \nIndia indicates that one-third of foreign tourists visit India in combination with other countries, \nnotably Nepal. A 2006 study in Bhutan records that 25% of visitors combined their visits with \nIndia, 13% with Nepal, and 8% with Nepal and India.      \n \n9.  According to United Nations World Tourism Organization estimates, the global market \nfor nature and culture-based tourism is growing about five times the growth rate of standard \ntourism.  The  western  ecotourism  market  segments  provide  convincing  potential  for  the \nsubregion in terms of both volume and yield. Similarly, for Buddhist attractions, strong growth in \ndemand  is observed  from  both  domestic  and  international  markets,  which  range  across a \nspectrum from pilgrims on a religious quest, to long-staying visitors pursuing spiritual studies or \nBuddhist  spiritual  well-being,  and  general  sightseers.  The  subregion\u2019s  unique  natural  and \ncultural endowments therefore position it as a world destination for spiritual and heritage tourism \noffering immense opportunities for the socioeconomic growth of the subregion. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n10.  Despite the impressive range of its superb cultural, natural, and spiritual endowments \nand sharp increases in tourist arrivals in recent years, the subregion\u2019s share of world tourism \nremains insignificant. In 2007, the three countries\u2019 5.7 million international visitors represented \n0.4% of world tourism. Potential tourists in the source markets and the tourism industry widely \nperceive the region as a \u201cdifficult\u201d destination for a number of reasons.  \n \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance for Preparing the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Tourism \nDevelopment Project. Manila (TA 6362- REG, December, $1.0 million). \n ", "  3 \n11.  Limited Connectivity. An important constraint to tourism growth in the participating \ncountries is inadequate connectivity. Access to the heritage assets is a major impediment. \nDistances from source markets to the subregion as well as within the subregion are so great \nthat air access in some cases is vital to tourism development. This is especially the case for \nLumbini in Nepal where connectivity to the site is limited, with no direct air services from key \nregional and international visitor markets. Air access to Lumbini is through Kathmandu only. The \nairport, located within half an hour drive from Lumbini, currently serves only to domestic flights. \nThere is need to upgrade this airport to enable direct access of growing number of visitors to \nLumbini by increasing the airport\u2019s capacity for the load and volume of passengers, enhancing \nits service level, and increasing its ability to handle international air traffic. There are also \naccessibility constraints arising from poor \"last mile\" road connectivity to many of the important \nsites along the Bangladesh Heritage Highway and in Sikkim State in India. These deter tourists \nfrom visiting these significant cultural and natural sites and hinder the potential to expand \ncurrent tourism patterns and spread tourism benefits more widely. If the subregion is to be \npresented  on  a  world  stage,  providing  access  to  places,  where  culture  and  nature-based \ntourism products can be delivered, is a fundamental need.   \n \n12.  Inadequate Destination Infrastructure. There is a general perception of the subregion \nin the marketplace as poorly developed tourism destinations. Environmental standards are poor. \nUtilities  and  civic  services,  such  as  water,  sanitation,  and  solid  waste  management  are \ninadequate and do not provide safe and attractive environments for visitors. In all of the cultural \nand natural heritage sites of tourism importance (including Lumbini in Nepal, Sikkim\u2019s  Rumtek \nmonastery and nature-based sites, and heritage sites along the Bangladesh Heritage Highway), \ntraffic management around the sites is inadequate; parking is limited; on-site visitor circulation \nremains poor; public amenities such as rest rooms and toilets are unfit for visitor use; basic \nvisitor information and site interpretation facilities are either unavailable or substandard; the \nmonuments along the Bangladesh Heritage Highway are in need of conservation to maintain \ntheir cultural value; and the infrastructure to properly protect key cultural and natural heritage \nsites  from  adverse  effects  of  tourism  and  the  surrounding  populations  is  not  in  place. \nInadequate environmental services, on-site infrastructure, and facilities are causing degradation \nof heritage structures and undermining the cultural and natural value of these heritage sites, \nwhile adversely affecting the visitor experience. Lack of visitor information and interpretation \nfacilities is limiting proper interpretation of the subregion\u2019s heritage. There is an urgent need to \nimprove the infrastructure and services in these sites most of which are World Heritage Sites.  \n \n13.  Weak Heritage Protection and Destination Management. The subregions' enormous \npotential for tourism development is further constrained by inadequate institutional capacity and \nhuman resources of sector agencies to plan, develop, protect, and manage these heritage \ndestinations and deliver quality tourist experiences. Capacity of public sector agencies such as \nNepal\u2019s  Lumbini  Development  Trust  (LDT),  India\u2019s  Sikkim  Department  of  Tourism,  and \nBangladesh\u2019s Department of Archeology, which are responsible for managing their respective \nsites, are in need of strengthening. The master plans for Nepal's Lumbini and Bangladesh\u2019s \ncultural heritage sites are outdated while no master plan exists for Sikkim\u2019s Rumtek monastery. \nSimilarly, site management plans either do not exist or are not being implemented. Funds for \nprotection and management of heritage assets and sites are grossly inadequate. Tourist entry \nfees  and  user  charges,  which  can  be  used  for  sustainable  sources  of  revenue  for  site \nmanagement,  are  not  sufficient.  The  situation  is  aggravated  by  inadequate  community \nawareness of the value of the cultural and natural heritage, and potential benefits that will \naccrue from sustainable heritage tourism. Sustainable heritage tourism in the subregion is \nfurther constrained by weak capacity of existing training institutions and absence of a center of \nexcellence specializing in sustainable culture and nature-based tourism. The resulting weak \n   ", "4   \nprotection and management of heritage destinations is a major risk, which unless effectively \naddressed, could result in the loss of these indispensable heritage assets and tourism markets. \n \n14.  Inadequate Community Engagement. The heritage sites in the subregion, including \nNepal\u2019s Lumbini, Bangladesh Heritage Highway sites, and nature and culture-based heritage \nsites in Sikkim in India, are all located far from major growth centers, and therefore offer great \npotential for diversifying and spreading tourism benefits in the subregion. However, the absence \nof connectivity and destination infrastructure constrains potential benefits from tourism to local \ncommunities. Potential benefits are further limited by inadequate mobilization of communities in \ntourism, lack of tourism-related skills among the local populations, and weak supply chain \nlinkages between the local economy and tourism. There are immense opportunities to promote \ninclusive tourism and community tourism products in and around Nepal\u2019s Lumbini, Bangladesh \nHeritage Highway sites, and Sikkim\u2019s Buddhist circuit and natural sites through infrastructure \ndevelopment and special efforts for mobilizing communities to engage in the tourism economy. \nThe subregion has already had good practices of inclusive tourism such as the Tourism for \nRural  Poverty  Alleviation  program  (TRPA)  in  Nepal  and  the  award-winning  village  tourism \nprojects in Sikkim. There is need to foster participation of communities in tourism and increase \nthe benefits to local populations building on these good practices.  \n \n15.  Limited Public Private Partnerships. Currently the private sector provides hospitality \nservices,  including  accommodation,  retail,  and  tour  operations.  However,  inadequate \nconnectivity and destination infrastructure creates an unfavorable climate for the hospitality \nindustry, whose investments are needed for tourism growth and tourism-related employment \ngeneration in the subregion. Investments to improve connectivity and destinations, which are \nidentified  in  close  consultation  with  the  industry,  will  induce  private  investments  in \ncomplementary hospitality services. While planned and regulated public sector investments in \nkey connectivity and environmental improvements and protection of these environmentally and \nculturally sensitive heritage sites are essential at this time, there is need in the medium term to \npromote,  (i)  partnerships  between  the  community,  and  the  private  and  public  sectors  in \ncommunity-based tourism to enhance marketability (e.g., heritage village products); and (ii) \nprivate sector participation in the management of sites and assets in a regulated manner for \nmore efficient and sustainable management of heritage sites and properties. There is need to \ntest and gradually introduce innovative partnership models.  \n \n16.  Cross-Border Travel. Many tourists to the subregion combine travel to a few countries. \nHowever, currently some border points do not offer efficient and smooth services for the entry \nand exit of tourists. Benefits will significantly increase in the long-run if cross-border travel is \nfurther streamlined. Possible actions to facilitate cross-border travel include, depending on the \nspecific  border  point,  streamlining  visa  issuance  procedures,  facilitating  tourist  vehicle \nmovements, and coordinating border opening times and duration. The participating countries \nrecognize these issues and they are at various stages of addressing them. A recently approved \nregional TA3 will also support the three countries and their subregional partners in developing a \nplan of action to streamline cross-border travel in the subregion.  \n  \n17.  Participating Governments\u2019 Policies. Notwithstanding the above constraints, all of the \nparticipating countries\u2019 policies promote sustainable and inclusive development. The countries \nprioritize  tourism  as  a  sector  with  capacity  to  make  a  significant  contribution  to  inclusive \ndevelopment,  enhanced  protection  and  management  of  natural  and  cultural  assets,  and \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance for Improving Connectivity and Destination Management of Cultural and Natural \nResources of South Asia Subregion. Manila (TA 6504-REG, December, $2.0 million financed by the Regional \nCooperation and Integration Fund under the Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing Partnership Facility). \n ", "  5 \nsustainable development of physical environments. Nepal's Interim Plan (2008\u20132010) reaffirms \nthe Government's plans for further supporting tourism as a major contributor to economic growth \nand livelihood generation through air transport and destination improvements. India's 11th Five \nYear  Plan  (2008\u20132012)  confirms  the  Government\u2019s  continued  commitment  to  tourism \ndevelopment as also reflected in the Asian Development Bank's (ADB) country partnership \nstrategy (2008-2012) for India. Likewise, the Government of Bangladesh since 1999 recognizes \ntourism as a thrust sector; it acknowledges the need to tap the potential of the country's vast \ncultural heritage for inclusive tourism growth. The recent cultural policy of Bangladesh confirms \nthe priority attached by the Government to enhanced management of heritage.   \n  \n18.  Subregional Cooperation in Tourism. Until recently, each of the three countries has \nbeen trying to carve out a niche in the market without any efforts to tap the potential synergies \nof tourism endowments available in the subregion. In 2001, Nepal, India, and Bangladesh, and \ntheir subregional partners (i.e., Bhutan and Sri Lanka) recognized the need to work together to \npromote tourism. The three countries and their subregional partners acknowledged that tourism \nin South Asia is a multicountry activity, and that there is need to harness the complementarities \nand contiguity of individual country tourism endowments. In 2001, a tourism working group \n(TWG) was formed comprising members of the national tourism organizations of Nepal, India, \nBangladesh, and Bhutan under the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Program \n(SASEC). The TWG was subsequently expanded with the participation of Sri Lanka. In 2004, \nthe TWG with ADB assistance developed and adopted a tourism strategy4, covering the five \ncountries, and building on the national tourism plans. Since then, the tourism strategy has \nprovided a framework for coordinated efforts of the TWG to promote tourism based on the \nthemes of nature and culture-based tourism, including Buddhist circuits.  \n \n19.  Towards Joint Development of Infrastructure. More recently, the TWG countries \naspired  to  work  toward  more  tangible  outcomes  through  joint  development  of  tourism \ninfrastructure in a phased manner. A South Asia Tourism Circuit and Infrastructure Vision, \nprepared with ADB support (footnote 2) and endorsed by the TWG demonstrates the countries\u2019 \ncommitment  to  joint  development  of  infrastructure  along  defined  multi-country  circuits  that \ncombine  complementary  country  assets  into  marketable  subregional  tourism  products.  A \nmulticountry circuit is defined as a route on which more than one or two major destinations are \nlocated in more than one country. In this way, a tourist who enters a destination in one country \nis motivated to visit other destinations along the same route located in another country, hence \nresulting in increased arrivals to all destinations in more than one country.   \n \n20.  South Asia Tourism Circuits and Infrastructure Vision. The vision, endorsed by \nNepal, India, and Bangladesh and their subregional partners, involves a pattern of interlinked \nmulticountry circuits of nature and culture-based destinations determined and ranked on the \nbasis  of  the  criteria,  including  the  levels  of  market  demand,  contribution  to  national  and \nsubregional  tourism  growth,  and  poverty  reduction.  The  vision  also  broadly  identifies  the \ninvestment  requirements  of  these  multicountry  circuits  in  terms  of  access  and  destination \ninfrastructure, as well as improved management. The vision, thus, (i) provides a long-term \ndevelopment planning framework for phased development of infrastructure along multicountry \ncircuits in accordance with priorities and available funds, and (ii) sets the basis for the highest \npriority circuits and the subprojects to be included in the Project (Appendix 2). \n \n21.  The Project forms part of the South Asia tourism circuits and infrastructure vision. It \nincludes the integrated development of priority tourism infrastructure and services in selected \n                                                 \n4  Prepared under ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance for the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Tourism \nDevelopment Plan. Manila. (TA 6131-REG, November, $450,000).  \n   ", "6   \nmulticountry circuits ranked in the vision document as highest priority circuits with greatest \npotential for inclusive and sustainable tourism development. The priority circuits, included in the \nProject, are (i) the Nepal portion of the Footsteps of the Lord Buddha circuit that cuts across \nIndia and Nepal, and combines Lumbini, the birth place of Buddha with the Buddhist sites of \nnorthern India, (ii) the Sikkim portion of both the greater Himalayan trail and the northeast India \ncircuits centered near India\u2019s Bagdogra, an air gateway linking the Himalayan culture, trekking, \nand adventure destinations of Sikkim, with northeastern Indian states, east Nepal, northern \nBangladesh, and Bhutan, and (iii) the Bangladesh Heritage Highway connecting a cultural \nheritage-focused corridor from north to the south in the western regions of Bangladesh with \nestablished tourist flows in West Bengal and the northeast region of India.  \n \n22.  Public sector intervention in the tourism sector in a subregional framework is required to \n(i) link and collectively promote the complementary and contiguous tourism attractions of the \nsubregion\u2019s countries that individually may not be able to attract high international arrivals; (ii) \nminimize  infrastructure  constraints  and  bottlenecks  that  hamper  tourism  development;  (iii) \nregulate and enhance the sustainable protection and use of public tourism assets of natural and \ncultural  importance  by  tourists,  the  private  sector,  and  communities  to  reduce  negative \nexternalities; and (iv) increase opportunities for the subregion\u2019s communities to benefit from \ntourism. The Project will have synergies with other ongoing and planned subregional initiatives, \ne.g., ADB\u2019s subregional transport and communications project.     \n \n23.  External  Assistance  and  Lessons.  No  major  development  partners  are  active  in \nsubregional tourism in South Asia, except JBIC, which is involved in tourism infrastructure \ndevelopment in India, and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization \n(UNESCO) with indirect involvement through mostly technical assistance for the protection of \ncultural heritage sites. The Project will be ADB\u2019s first lending assistance for a subregional \nproject  in  the  tourism  sector  in  South  Asia.  The  Project  is  a  culmination  of  a  process  of \nsubregional cooperation in tourism in which ADB has played a major role since 2001 under \nSASEC program. ADB, in accordance with its South Asia regional cooperation strategy and \nprogram (2006\u20132008) and through several regional TAs, supported the formation of the TWG \nand a tourism strategy for South Asia. While the strategy has been a useful first step towards a \nframework for subregional action in tourism, it proved to be too ambitious to lead to focused \ninterventions. A following regional TA on human resource development in the tourism sector has \nbeen effective in creating a pool of trainers with a view to cascading the knowledge to the \nnational level, but again pointed to the need for more focused and sustainable outcomes.  \n \n24.  While ADB, to date, has not provided any lending assistance for subregional tourism in \nSouth Asia, it provided two loans to Nepal for tourism infrastructure development in 1992 and \n1996. Overall, these projects, especially air connectivity and ecotourism interventions, are found \nrelevant and effective, except urban tourism improvements, which suffered from weak municipal \ncapacities. Lessons include the following (i) marketing of destinations developed is critical, (ii) \nprivate sector involvement in site identification is needed to ensure viability, (iii) community \ninvolvement enhances sustainability, (iv) rigorous financial and marketability assessment of \ntourism sites is required, and (v) up-front capacity building of project agencies is important for \ntimely implementation and sustenance of project outcomes and outputs. A recent evaluation \nstudy5 rates ADB assistance to the Greater Mekong Subregion tourism sector \"successful\" while \nproviding several lessons, including the need for (i) greater facilitation of border crossings, (ii) \ninclusive approaches to ensure that tourism benefits local communities, (iii) improved inter-\nsectoral and interagency coordination, and (iv) accurate demand analysis. These lessons are \n                                                 \n5 ADB. 2008. Evaluation Study on the Tourism Sector in the Greater Mekong Subregion.

Donor coordination will be maintained through TWG at the subregional level, while \ninvolvement of UNESCO in the Project will be ensured to utilize its technical expertise in the \ndevelopment of heritage destinations in each participating country.           \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome  \n \n25.  The expected impact of the Project is sustainable and inclusive development in South \nAsia by tapping the potential of contiguous and complementary tourism assets of Nepal, India, \nand Bangladesh. This will be reflected in an increase in the contribution of tourism to the \nsubregion\u2019s  economy  and  employment  opportunities.  The  expected  outcomes  are  several \nsubregional  circuits  of  nature  and  culture-based  tourism  destinations  with  (i)  improved \nconnectivity,  (ii)  better  quality  environment  and  visitor  services;  (iii)  enhanced  natural  and \ncultural  heritage,  and  capacity  for  sustainable  heritage  management;  and  (iv)  greater \nengagement of communities in heritage management and tourism benefits. These outcomes will \nbe achieved by (i) improving access and destination infrastructure and services in key nature \nand culture-based tourism sites located along selected multicountry tourist circuits; (ii) building \nthe capacities of sector agencies for sustainable protection and management of natural and \ncultural heritage sites as well as tourism-related infrastructure and assets e.g., airport; and (iii) \nstrengthening  linkages  between  tourism  and  local  population  and  building  the  capacity  of \ncommunities to enable them to obtain greater benefits from tourism. The Project includes three \ncountries: Nepal, India, and Bangladesh.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n26.  Project outputs include (i) connectivity enhancement; (ii) destination improvements; and \n(iii)  support  for  fostering  community  participation,  capacity  development,  and  project \nmanagement. The first output involves upgrading air and road access to selected natural and \ncultural sites of importance for tourism. The second output includes (depending on the sites\u2019 \nneeds)  environmental  improvements,  visitor  infrastructure  and  services,  on-site  visitor \ncirculation  systems,  and  heritage  protection.  The  third  output  involves  interventions  for  (i) \ngreater  community  engagement  in  heritage  management  and  tourism;  (ii)  institutional  and \nhuman resources development of relevant agencies in planning, developing, managing and \npromoting heritage sites of tourism importance; and (iii) effective project implementation. A \ndescription of each output for each country is provided below. Detailed descriptions of the \nproject components for each country are in Supplementary Appendixes A, B, and C.   \n \n1.  Nepal   \n \n27.  In Nepal, the Project aims to develop the Nepal portion of the \u201cFootsteps of the Lord \nBuddha circuit6 by focusing interventions on Lumbini. The importance of Lumbini stems from the \nSacred  Garden,  a  World  Heritage  site  that  includes  the  birthplace  of  Buddha  and  related \narchaeological  remains  and  structures.  Interventions  are  directed  at  (i)  enhancing  the \nconnectivity to Lumbini, (ii) destination improvements in Lumbini, and (iii) capacity development \nof relevant public sector site managers and communities. \n \n28.  Connectivity Enhancement. This component aims to enhance air access to Lumbini by \nupgrading the Gautam Buddha airport to international standards. This involves (i) construction \n                                                 \n6  The India portion of the Footsteps of the Lord Buddha circuit (the Buddhist sites in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar) of \nIndia) is developed by the Government of India with support from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation.  \n   ", "8   \nof a new runway, exit taxiway, and apron pavement; (ii) rehabilitation of the existing runway for \nconversion to parallel taxiway; (iii) refurbishment and expansion of existing terminal building as \na domestic terminal building; (iv) construction of a new international terminal building: (v) new \ncontrol tower, customs and cargo building, and crash fire rescue building, (vi) water supply, \nsewerage, and drainage improvements and other civil works such as Ghaghara Khola irrigation \ncanal diversion, roads, and security fence; (vii) expansion of fuel farm; and (viii) and installation \nof communication and navigational equipment suitable for international airports. The airport will \nbe constructed as category 4E in accordance with the guidelines of the International Civil \nAviation Organization. \n \n29.   Destination Improvements. This component focuses on the Lumbini master plan area. \nIt aims to enhance the protection and management of Lumbini and experience of visitors by \nimproving the environmental quality, the outstanding universal value of the site, and visitor \nfacilities. Improvements include (i) development of car parking and bus stop; (ii) completion of \nthe unfinished portion of the perimeter road; (iii) provision of localized source-based drinking \nwater  supply;  (iv)  provision  of  toilets  in  key  locations;  (v)  solid  waste  management \nimprovements;  (vi)  enhancement  of  on-site  interpretation  displays  and  signage  telling  the \nBuddhist history of Lumbini; and (vii) construction of a visitor center, and landscaping and \npedestrian walkways around the visitor center to enhance initial reception of visitors and provide \nvisitors with required information and orientation about Lumbini.   \n \n30.   Fostering Community Participation, Capacity Building, and Project Management. \nThis component aims to foster community engagement in heritage management and tourism, \nbuild the capacity of agencies involved in managing heritage and tourism infrastructure, and \nsupport effective and timely implementation of the Project.  \n \n31.  Community  Participation.  The  subcomponent  includes  community  awareness-raising \nprograms on the importance of Lumbini as a world heritage site and potential benefits from \ntourism to the local economy, particularly new markets and livelihood opportunities that the local \npeople can access. The subcomponent also supports a demonstration scheme for heritage \ntourism livelihood generation including (i) social mobilization, (ii) skills development in heritage \nsite management and tourism-related activities based on a value chain analysis, and (iii) linking \ncommunities  to  available  microfinance  services.  Local  and  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs) and microfinance service providers experienced in similar schemes are expected to be \ninvolved as needed. The scheme builds on Nepal\u2019s good practice \u201cTourism for Rural Poverty \nAlleviation project\u201d and emphasizes market linkages (Supplementary Appendix D). \n \n32.  Capacity Building. This subcomponent primarily supports capacity building and human \nresource development of (i) LDT which is responsible for planning and management of the \nLumbini area; and (ii) the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN), which is in charge of air \ntransport infrastructure and services.  \n \n33.  Assistance to LDT includes developing and implementing measures to strengthen LDT \nin (i) strategic planning, (ii) heritage protection, (iii) visitor management, (iv) environmental \nmanagement, (v) maintenance of site infrastructure, (vi) financial management and revenue \ngeneration, (vii) coordination of multistakeholders, and (viii) engagement of communities in \nheritage tourism. The subcomponent also supports LDT in updating the Lumbini master plan \nand preparing a management plan for the World Heritage site in cooperation with UNESCO. \nSupport  includes  defining  linkages  between  the  master  plan  and  the  broader  Lumbini \ndevelopment  area,  and  integrating  measures  for  institutional  development  and  financial \nmanagement into the updated master plan and development control regulation. As part of the \n ", "  9 \nefforts to promote Lumbini, the Project also provides assistance to the Nepal Tourism Board to \ndesign and implement a marketing program for Lumbini and other Buddhist sites in its vicinity in \ncoordination with regional TA (footnote 3).  \n \n34.  For  CAAN,  the  assistance  focuses  on  enhancing  the  capacity  for  management  of \nGautam Buddha airport. This involves preparation and implementation of a business plan for the \nairport, including support for setting and restructuring aeronautical and nonaeronautical rates, \npossible outsourcing of various functions and other cost management measures, as well as staff \ntraining programs in airport management and financing.  \n \n35.  Project  Management.  This  subcomponent  supports  funding  the  costs  of  the  project \ncoordination unit (PCU) in the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation (MOTCA) and project \nmanagement  and  implementation  units  (PMIUs)  in  LDT  and  CAAN,  including  incremental \nadministration and operations related to implementation, provision of equipment, logistics, and \nconsulting services. \n \n  2.  India  \n \n36.  The India portion of the Project focuses on Sikkim State, with magnificent mountains, \npristine environment, and significant Buddhist heritage. Sikkim is located at the geographic \ncenter of the subregion and has a good road connection to Bagdogra, the subregional hub with \npotential links to the Bangladesh Cultural Heritage Highway circuit, east Nepal, Bhutan, and \nother northeastern states. In addition to its strategic location and splendid attractions, Sikkim \nhas a good record of practices in sustainable and responsible tourism, which potentially position \nit as a center of excellence for subregional experience sharing and capacity development in \nsustainable heritage tourism.  \n \n37.  The connectivity and destination improvements in Sikkim focus on (i) a world-renowned \nBuddhist site, the Rumtek monastery, situated within 24 kilometers (km) away from Gangtok, \nthe capital city of the State; (ii) the nature-based sites in west Sikkim which form a part of the \ngreater Himalayan trail (footnote 1); (iii) village tourism development; and (iv) transformation of \nSikkim into a center of subregional learning in nature and culture-based tourism by supporting \nthe development of a training institute (Himalayan Training Institute) already initiated by the \nGovernment of India.  \n \n38.  Connectivity Enhancement. This component involves improvements to several roads \nto enhance access to attractions around the Rumtek monastery complex and the proposed \ntraining institute. The first road improvement aims to expand the current \u201cthere and back\u201d \npattern of tourist flows between Gangtok and the Rumtek monastery into a circular trip enabling \nan option for tourists to visit other nearby attractions\u2014the Lingdum monastery and Ban Jakhri \nFalls.  This  involves  upgrading  of  the  Sajong\u2013Lingdum\u2013Gangtok  road,  including  surface \nimprovement, strengthening, and widening from single to intermediate lane of about 20 km of \napproach road from Sajong to Gangtok via Lingdum and the Ban Jakhri Falls. The second road \nimprovement aims to enhance access to a unique site next to Rey Khola\u2014a perennial stream\u2014\na unique natural attraction located about 800 meters off the road to Rumtek. The improvements \nto this road include upgrading the single lane earthen road to blacktop leading to the site. The \nthird road improvement enhances access to the Himalayan Training Institute in Chemchey by \nstrengthening and widening, from single to intermediate lane, about 3 km of road to the site. The \nfourth road improvement includes strengthening and widening, the last 2.2 km to the site of the \nstatue of Guru Padma Sambhava in Sandruptkse in the vicinity of the training institute.  \n   ", "10   \n39.  Destination Improvements. These include (i) improvements in the Rumtek monastery \ncircuit, (ii) small-scale infrastructure improvements in West Sikkim\u2019s nature-based sites, (iii) \ndevelopment of the Himalayan Training Institute, and (iv) village infrastructure development. \n \n40.  Rumtek Monastery Circuit. Interventions aim to enhance the environmental quality and \ncultural value of the heritage site, and to address visitor needs within the Rumtek monastery \ncomplex as well as several other attractions outside the complex on the circuit. Improvements to \nthe Rumtek monastery complex include (i) development of a parking facility for about 250 \nvehicles outside the gate of the complex and on-street parking; (ii) improvement of toilets; (iii) \nprovision of solid waste management facilities and services; (iv) development of a water storage \nand  replacement  of  the  distribution  network;  (v)  construction  of  a  visitor  information  and \nBuddhist interpretation center; (vi) development of a building facade regulation, and modification \nof facades in compliance with the regulation; and (vii) landscaping works, including converting \noverhead utility lines to underground lines. Improvements outside the complex and on the \nintermediate locations of the circuit focus on Shanti viewpoint and the waterfront of Rey Khola. \nShanti viewpoint improvements include development of car park and a viewing platform and \nrehabilitation  of  toilet  and  tourist  facilities.  Rey  Khola  waterfront  improvements  involve \ndevelopment of a car park, public open space with landscaping along the river, a pedestrian \npathway with railing along the river edge, access to water by steps at two locations, and toilets. \n \n41.  West Sikkim Himalayan Trail. Improvements aim to enhance the safety and to address \nthe basic needs of tourists, and to ensure the protection and management of natural heritage \nalong the important trekking trails and the Yuksam base camp in west Sikkim. The trekking trail \nimprovements  focus  on  Singalila  trekking  trail,  which  passes  through  the  wilderness  in  a \nmountainous terrain of the Singalila ranges, mostly within West Sikkim, with a part in Nepal at \nMegu. Improvements include (i) strengthening and construction of trails; (ii) trail signs; (iii) \ndevelopment of campsites in designated locations; (iv) water supply, toilet, and bathing facilities; \nand  (v)  solid  waste  management.  Improvements  to  the  Yuksam  base  camp  focus  on \nredevelopment,  including  provision  of  common  facilities,  e.g.,  toilets,  information  center, \nadministrative facilities, and a field training facility and equipment to be used in conjunction with \nactivities of the proposed Himalayan Training Institute. \n \n42.  Himalayan Training Institute. This subcomponent is aimed at meeting the need and \ndemand for a center of excellence to promote sustainable practices in nature and culture-based \ntourism  in  the  subregion.  The  institute  is  envisaged  to  deliver  various  short-term  courses, \nseminars, and long-term programs of up to 1 year for public sector officials, trainers, community \nleaders, and private sector stakeholders involved in conserving, developing, and managing, \nnature- and culture-based tourism products in ecologically and culturally sensitive areas. The \ntarget group also includes national and international students seeking to build a career in nature \nand culture-based tourism. The institute is envisaged to partner with other institutes offering \nspecialized courses, and bring national and international trainers and experts.  \n43.  The physical investments for completion of the training institute include (i) construction of \na training center with six classrooms, two seminar halls, a library and documentation center, \nstaff  room, and  services;  (ii)  an  auditorium  with  seating capacity  for  200,  and audiovisual \nequipment, and furniture and fittings; (iii) expansion of currently constructed student hostels and \nprovision of staff quarters; and (iv) provision of training equipment and storage. The Himalayan \nTraining Institute interventions also include improvement of a nearby heritage attraction, the site \nand  statue  of  Guru  Padmasambhava,  more  specifically  repairing  the  current  cracks  and \nretrofitting the statue, and improving the drainage, toilets, and solid waste management of the \nsite. A key area of assistance for the institute is the smooth operationalization and long-term \nsustainability of the institute under the capacity building subcomponent. \n ", "  11 \n \n44.  Village  Tourism  Infrastructure  Development.  The  subcomponent  aims  to  use  the \npotential of the major destinations to attract tourists to surrounding villages. It focuses on three \nvillages each within easy access of the Rumtek monastery circuit, West Sikkim trekking trails, \nand the Himalayan Training Institute. Improvements are targeted at enhancing the physical \nenvironment and heritage of villages and visitor services. These include, depending on the \nspecific needs of each village, provision of water supply, sanitation, and waste management \nimprovements; improvements to trekking trails passing through the villages; designing village \nwalks covering the key village attractions; development of viewpoints; directional signage; visitor \ninformation centers; and cultural performance stages. All these physical improvements are \naccompanied by community preparation activities under the capacity building subcomponent. \nThe component builds on the award-winning village tourism projects in Sikkim. \n     \n 45.  Fostering Community Participation, Capacity Building, and Project   Management. \nThis component aims to complement the inclusive infrastructure development interventions in \nSikkim  with  increased  community  engagement  in  sustainable  heritage  management  and \ntourism, and improved capacity of relevant public sector agencies and other stakeholders.  \n \n46.  Community  Participation  and  Partnership.  The  subcomponent  includes  general \nawareness-raising  programs  on  the  importance  of  natural  and  cultural  heritage  sites  and \npotential  benefits  from  tourism  to  the  community.  A  specific  focus  is  placed  on  fostering \ncommunity  engagement  in  (i)  the  West  Sikkim  Himalayan  Trail,  and  (ii)  heritage  villages \nidentified for tourism infrastructure development. Activities in West Sikkim include formation and \ncapacity  development  of  ecodevelopment  committees  representing  local  communities  and \ndeveloping  skills  on  ecotourism  services.  Support  for  heritage  villages  includes (i)  forming \nvillage  communities;  (ii)  training  villagers  in  heritage  management  and  hospitality  skills \nespecially  in  home-stay  management,  handicraft  development,  and  marketing,  and  other \nactivities; and (iii) establishing links with the distribution end, e.g., the tour operators with a view \nto promoting community, private and public partnership in heritage village tourism. These utilize \nthe state's current enabling framework for community involvement in ecotourism and build on \naward-winning  village  tourism  schemes.  NGOs  with  competence  in  similar  programs  are \nexpected to be involved as needed (Supplementary Appendix E). \n \n47.  Capacity Building. Efforts are directed at (i) building the capacity of relevant agencies, \nincluding the Sikkim\u2019s Department of Tourism (DOT) which is the executing and implementing \nagency for the Project; and other stakeholders involved in planning, developing, and managing \nthe tourism and heritage assets; and (ii) operationalizing the Himalayan Training Institute. \n \n48.  Assistance to DOT includes (i) drafting guidelines for nature and culture-based tourism; \n(ii) establishing within DOT a unit for inclusive tourism; (iii) enhancing DOT revenues through \nlevies and collection of various tourist entry fees and charges, and in the medium-term ring-\nfencing  of  tourism  revenues;  (iv)  identifying  areas  of  special  importance  for  regulated \ndevelopment, and helping in notification of those areas as planning zones; (v) preparing a \nmaster plan for the Rumtek Monastery circuit; and (vi) marketing and promoting the circuits and \nsites  created,  in  coordination  with  subregional  marketing  and  promotion  efforts  under  the \nregional TA (footnote 3). Moreover, the assistance includes training of site managers at key \nagencies i.e., DOT, Department of Forest, the Ecclesiastical Department, and any other relevant \nagency, including Rumtek monastery administration. \n \n49.  Support for operationalizing the Himalayan Training Institute involves developing and \nassisting in the implementation of an operation and business plan, including (i) identification of \ntechnical  and  managerial  skills  and  other  requirements  to  run  the  institute;  (ii)  design  of \n   ", "12   \ncurricula; (iii) identification of various laws, professional bodies, and committees governing and \nregulating the spectrum of nature and culture-based tourism; (iv) preparation of a prerequisites \nlist to obtain appropriate affiliations, all mandatory approvals, and accreditations to conduct \ncredible training programs; (v) identification of potential strategic partners whose experience, \nexpertise, and market reach could be utilized; and (vi) development of measures to transform \nthe institute in the medium-term into a not-for-profit organization to enable DOT to retain a \nsupervisory role and enhance the financial sustainability of the institute. \n \n50.  Project Management. This subcomponent supports funding the costs of the PMIU in \nDOT and project implementation units in West Sikkim and South Sikkim, including incremental \nadministration and operations, and provision of equipment, logistics, and consulting services.  \n \n3.  Bangladesh \n \n51.  The Bangladesh portion of the Project aims to promote key cultural heritage sites along \na heritage-rich geographic corridor extending from north to the south in the western regions of \nBangladesh.  Improving  the  access  and  site  conditions,  protecting  and  managing  these \nsignificant heritage sites, and promoting them through an innovative concept of a \u201cheritage \nhighway\u201d are expected to lead to increasing visitor numbers and the spread of tourism benefits \nto remote communities.  \n \n52.  The Bangladesh portion of the proposed Project, to be implemented using a sector loan \napproach, includes the four key sites \u2014Paharpur, Mahastangarh, Kantajee, and Bagerhat. A \ndetailed subproject, already prepared for Paharpur, forms the first batch of subprojects for \nimplementation. The subproject serves as a sample for design and feasibility of other sites that \nhave already been identified and that will be confirmed as subprojects on the basis of the \nsubproject selection and preparation criteria set out in section F of Supplementary Appendix C. \nThe proposed subproject for Paharpur, a World Heritage Site, builds on plans and studies \nconducted by UNESCO.  \n \n53.  Connectivity Enhancement. This component includes \"last mile\" connectivity roads to \nenhance access to the sites and manage visitor movement. In the case of Paharpur, the \ncomponent include (i) developing an intermediate lane road to enable access to the northern \ngate of the site culminating at the proposed parking space near the northern gateway, and (ii) a \npedestrian  pathway  along  the  eastern  side  to  facilitate  movement  of  local  residents  from \nsurrounding villages without trespassing the heritage site.     \n \n54.  Destination Improvements. This component includes (i) essential conservation works \nto  protect  the  cultural  value  and  authenticity  of  heritage  structures,  (ii)  improvements  to \nenvironmental  infrastructure  and  services,  which  will  prevent  destruction  of  the  sites  and \nstructures and their authenticity and upgrade the quality of the site environment, (iii) provision of \nfacilities to address visitor needs and control on-site movement of visitors and (iv) enhanced \ninterpretation and presentation of the sites. In the case of Paharpur, improvements aim to \naddress the major issues of (i) management of increased tourism, (ii) accumulation of salt in \nheritage due to inadequate drainage and use of inappropriate material in conservation, and (iii) \nwater  logging  and  resulting  degradation  of  heritage  structures.  Interventions  include  site \ndrainage  improvements;  provision  of  car  parks;  construction  of  a  visitor  information  and \ninterpretation center, ticket boots, toilets, and on-site walkways, on site signage, displays, and \nserviced area for commercial use; and reorganization of the heritage site space though various \nlandscaping work and walkway improvements.        \n \n ", "  13 \n55.  Fostering Community Participation, Capacity Building, and Project Management. \nThe component, as in other two participating countries, aims to foster engagement of local \ncommunities in heritage protection and tourism, build the capacity of agencies involved in \nheritage and tourism management, and ensure effective implementation of the Project.  \n \n56.  Community Participation. Activities include community awareness-raising programs on \nlinkages between sustainable heritage management and tourism, and the potential benefits \nfrom  heritage  tourism  to  communities.  A  major  activity  is  support  to  the  design  and \nimplementation of a demonstration scheme for tourism livelihood generation. This involves \nsocial  mobilization,  training  and  skills  development  for  local  communities  in  heritage  site \nmanagement and tourism-related activities, and establishment of linkages with microfinance \nservices based on supply chain analysis. The activities also involve building the capacities of \nDepartment of Archaeology (DOA) and Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation (BPC) to enable them \nto better interface with local communities and effectively engage in heritage tourism. Local \norganizations  and  NGOs  experienced  in  similar  programs  are  expected  to  be  involved  as \napplicable (Supplementary Appendix F). \n  \n57.  Capacity Building. The activities are primarily directed at (i) strengthening DOA which is \nresponsible for planning and managing the heritage sites, and (ii) increasing the interface \nbetween agencies responsible for heritage management and tourism, i.e., the Ministry of Civil \nAviation and Tourism, BPC, and DOA under the Ministry of Cultural Affairs. Support to DOA \ninvolves  (i)  developing  organizational  and  operational  systems  for  enhanced  heritage  site \nplanning, protection, and management; (ii) devising measures for increased revenue generation \nfrom  user  fees,  and  creating  dedicated  sources  of  funds  for  heritage  management  where \nfeasible through ring-fencing of incomes from heritage sites; (iii) developing incentive measures \nand conducting training for staff in planning, conservation, and management of heritage tourism; \nand (iv) preparing management plans for heritage sites and key studies for innovative heritage \nprotection and management. Further, assistance is given to BPC in designing and implementing \na marketing program and pilot livelihood scheme.    \n \n58.  Project  Management.  This  subcomponent  supports  the  PMIU  in  DOA  and  project \nimplementing units at the sites as well as BPC by funding the cost of incremental administration \nand other related costs, e.g., provision of equipment, logistics, and consulting services.   \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n59.  Subregional  Dimension.  The  Project  involves  three  countries  (Nepal,  India,  and \nBangladesh).  ADB  will  sign  separate  grant  and  loan  agreements  with  each  country.  The \nrationale for a subregional project rather than national tourism projects stems from the fact that \ndevelopment  of  tourism  in  each  country  in  isolation  will  become  increasingly  difficult  in  a \ncompetitive world tourism market. Isolated country efforts to develop tourism will also bring \nsuboptimal benefits given that tourism is a multicountry activity in the subregion. Substantial \nadditional  benefits  will  accrue  through  joint  development  and  promotion  of  high  potential \nmulticountry circuits that link the complementary and contiguous heritage assets of individual \ncountries, thus motivating tourists to visit more than one country in the subregion.   \n \n60.  Focus on Nature and Culture-Based Tourism. An important feature of the Project is \nits focus on nature and culture-based tourism, including Buddhist circuits. This provides an \nappropriate branding considering the subregion's rich natural and cultural endowments as well \nas the fast-growing global markets for nature and culture-based tourism. Moreover, developing \ntourism based on these themes accompanied with necessary safeguard measures, support for \nplanned  interventions,  and  capacity  building  of  all  stakeholders  on  heritage  management, \n   ", "14   \npresent greater opportunities for (i) enhancing sustainable protection and management of the \nnatural and cultural heritage assets and (ii) stimulating subregional action for management of \nprecious subregional heritage upon which the subregion\u2019s tourism depends.  \n \n61.  Support  for  Sustainability  and  Capacity  Building.  The  Project  supports  the \ngovernments\u2019 policies for sustainable heritage management and tourism growth. It includes \ncapacity development assistance in each country to assist in the attainment of the action plan, \nspecifically to  (i) guide planned interventions in heritage sites in accordance with international \nbenchmarks; (ii) strengthen public sector agencies in management of heritage and tourism \nassets; (iii) ensure community engagement in heritage protection and tourism; (iv) strengthen \nsector agencies in entering partnerships with the community and explore the opportunity for \npublic-private  sector  partnership  in  the  management  of  heritage  sites,  and  (v)  enhance \nrevenues for sustainable management of heritage sites and other tourism infrastructure, e.g., \nairport, by introducing and rationalizing site entry fees; user charges for services, e.g., water \nsupply and toilets, parking fees where these are not concessioned out; concession fees on \ncommercial facilities undertaken by the private sector, and the sale of interpretative materials; \nand preparation of a Business Plan for the Gautam Buddha airport, including airport fees and \ncharges. The \u201csustainable heritage and tourism action plan\u201d is in Appendix 4. The Project\u2019s \napproach to public\u2013private partnership is in Supplementary Appendix E.   \n \n62.  Inclusive  Tourism.  Inclusive  tourism  principles  are  embedded  in  the  Project.  The \nProject\u2019s principals, including the (i) consideration of poverty as one of the criteria in selecting \ncircuits and subprojects, (ii) focus on cultural and natural heritage which are mostly located far \nfrom major growth centers, and (iii) inclusion of concepts such as the greater Himalayan trail, all \nenable linking the currently established tourism patterns to impoverished remote communities \nthus spreading tourism benefits more widely. To ensure that the communities can avail of the \nopportunities  created,  the  Project  incorporates  a  specific  program  to  foster  community \nengagement as an integral and tailored element of the Project in each participating country. This \ninvolves community mobilization, awareness-raising, and skills development in tourism; tailored \nschemes to promote tourism livelihood generation in Bangladesh and Nepal; and partnerships \nbetween the community, and public and private sectors through West Sikkim ecotourism and \nvillage tourism in Sikkim State in India (Supplementary Appendixes D, E, and F). \n \n63.  Grant-Funded Regional TA. The Project is supported by a grant-funded regional TA \n(footnote 3) which will commence ahead of the effectiveness of each loan and grant for each \nparticipating country. The TA aims to (i) enhance the readiness of countries for implementing \nthe  Project  through  capacity  building  in  project  management  and  implementation,  and  (ii) \naddress subregional aspects of tourism development. The latter includes support for (i) periodic \nreview  and  coordination  of  the  country-specific  projects  at  the  subregional  level,  (ii)  a \nsubregional tourism marketing and promotion program, (iii) streamlining cross-border travel, (iv) \nsubregional knowledge sharing through study tours and workshops on heritage tourism best \npractices  and  innovative  approaches  in  heritage  site  management,  and,  (v)  updating  the \nTourism Strategy of 2004 in line with the evolving priorities and needs for adjustments in view of \nthe new stage of subregional cooperation for joint tourism infrastructure development .  \n \nD.  Project Investment and Financing Plan \n \n64.  The project investment cost is estimated at $89.5 million, including taxes and duties of \n$7.35 million. The project cost for the Nepal portion is estimated at $46.5 million equivalent, for \nthe  India  portion  $28.0  million  equivalent,  and  for  the  Bangladesh  portion  $15.0  million. \nSummary estimates by component are in Table 1.

Procurement  \n \n76.62. Goods,  civil  works,  and  services  financed  by  ADB  and  OFID  will  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nInternational competitive bidding procedures will be used for civil works contracts estimated to \ncost $10.0 million or more in India, $2.0 million or more in Bangladesh, and $1.0 million or more \nin Nepal; and for supply contracts valued at $1.0 million or higher. The upper limit for civil works \nto be procured through national competitive bidding procedures will be less than $10.0 million in \nIndia, $2.0 million in Bangladesh, and $1.0 million in Nepal; and for equipment the upper limit \nwill be $1.0 million. Shopping will be used for contracts for procurement of equipment and \nsimple civil works of $100,000 or less.  \n \n77.  The size of procurement packages are made (i) on the basis of the particular nature of \nworks involved\u2014such as cultural heritage improvements, small-scale ecotourism infrastructure \nor connectivity infrastructure; and (ii) to enable reasonable competition in the bidding and to \nminimize contract administration and management efforts by the PCU and PMIUs. Before the \ncommencement of any procurement activity under national competitive bidding, ADB and the \nGovernment will review the public procurement laws of the participating government to ensure \nconsistency  with  the  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Any \nnecessary modifications or clarifications7 will be reflected in the relevant loan agreement and \nprocurement plan. The indicative procurement packages will be elaborated upon and updated \nby the PMIUs for approval by ADB. An indicative procurement plan is in Appendix 8. \n \n78.  Advance Action and Retroactive Financing. Advance action will be undertaken under \nthe  project  for  procurement  of  civil  works,  equipment,  and  materials,  and  recruitment  of \nconsultants. The Project offers retroactive financing for expenditures incurred during the period \nof 12 months prior to signing of the respective loan and grant agreements, and which do not \nexceed an amount equivalent to 20% of the individual loan or grant. The approval of advance \naction and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the Project.        \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n79.  Consultants  will  be  engaged  to  assist  the  PCU  and  PMIUs  in  managing  and \nimplementing the Project in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, \nas amended from time to time). Services will be required in the areas of project management, \ndetailed  design,  construction  supervision,  quality  control,  community  participation, \n                                                 \n7  These are available in the form of NCB annexes that become part of the procurement plan. The NCB annexes for \nNepal and Bangladesh require review and updating due to recently passed national procurement acts. \n ", "  19 \nenvironmental social safeguards, project performance monitoring and evaluation, and cultural \nheritage planning and management, ecotourism development, airport engineering, institutional \ndevelopment, and financial management.  \n \n80.  Teams of international and national consultants based at the PCU and PMIUs in each of \nthe countries will assist in managing, monitoring, and detailed design work and supervision of \nthe Project. The consultants will support the PMIUs on a sustained basis; delineate the PMIU\u2019s \nmethod and detailed program and work plans, procedures for coordination, management, and \nreporting; design, installation and operationalization of new systems as required; assist PMIU in \ndetailed  design,  update  environmental  and  resettlement  safeguard  documents,  prepare \ncontracts,  procure  construction  firms,  and  supervise  construction;  assist  in  planning  and \nimplementing capacity development, community participation, and marketing and promotion \nactivities and design and conduct of training programs including hands-on training. Consultants \nfor preparing the management and master plans for the cultural heritage sites especially for the \nworld heritage sites in Nepal and Bangladesh may be recruited separately. Services of NGOs \nand community-based organizations will likely be required for capacity building of communities, \nlivelihood  generation,  and  skill  development.  Terms  of  reference  for  consultants  for  each \ncountry are in Supplementary Appendixes M, N, and O. \n   \n81.  A total of 935 person-months consulting services are expected to be required for the \nProject.  The  consulting  services  requirement  for  Nepal  is  417  person-months  (30  person-\nmonths international and 387 person-months national), for India 333 person-months (12 person-\nmonths international and 321 person-months national), and for Bangladesh 185 person-months \n(25 person-months international and 160 person-months national). For contract values of at \nleast $200,000 and above, consultants will be selected following the quality- and cost-based \nselection method. For contracts valued at less than $200,000 and requiring highly specialized \nand  boutique  expertise,  the  consultants  qualification  selection  method  will  be  followed;  for \ncontracts valued at less than $100,000, consultants will be selected following the least-cost \nselection method.  \n \n5.   Anticorruption Policy \n \n82.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  all  three  participating  countries.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nlegal agreements and the bidding documents for each participating country under the Project. In \nparticular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project will include provisions \nspecifying the rights of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the executing \nand  implementing  agencies;  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service \nproviders as they relate to the Project. All the PMIUs in the three countries will announce the \nsubprojects and associated business opportunities on their websites and at least disclose the (i) \nlist of participating bidders, (ii) amount of the contracts awarded, and (iii) goods and services \nprocured.  Moreover,  grievance  redress  committees  will  be  formed  with  participation  of  all \nstakeholders in each country to address any public concern on the use of project funds.   \n \n6.  Disbursement \n \n83.  Payment of eligible expenditures from the proceeds of the loans and grant under the \nProject will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (January 2007, \nas amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements between ADB and the governments. \n   ", "20   \nAs the volume of expenditure will be quite large, the executing and implementing agencies will \nbe provided with imprest accounts to enhance their liquidity and ensure timely payments for \nproject expenditures.  \n \n84.  In Nepal, separate first generation imprest accounts will be opened by MOTCA and \noperated by PCU for the ADB loan, ADB grant, and OFID loan. Concurrently CAAN will open \nseparate second generation imprest accounts (SGIAs) for the ADB loan, ADB grant, and OFID \nloan in current accounts in a commercial bank acceptable to ADB. LDT will open a separate \nSGIA for the ADB grant. In India, the Government will open a first generation imprest account in \nthe account of the Controller of Aid Accounts and Audit with the Reserve Bank of India. The \nSikkim state government will open an SGIA as a current account in a reputed commercial bank \nsubject to commitment of the state and DOT to adhere to ADB procedures for operating the \nSGIA. All disbursements made by ADB towards imprest advance or replenishment should be \ncredited to SGIA within 30 calendar days. In Bangladesh, the Government will open an imprest \naccount at the Bangladesh Bank which will fund an SGIA to be opened by DOA at a commercial \nbank selected in accordance with Borrower's procedures that are acceptable to ADB.  \n  \n85.  The initial advances to and the ceiling of each of the imprest accounts will be based on \nestimated expenditures for the first 6 months or 10% of the total ADB grant and/or loan amount, \nwhichever  is  lower.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and \nliquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007 as amended from \ntime to time) and detailed arrangements agreed upon between each country and ADB. The \nstatement  of  expenditures  procedure  will  be  used  to  reimburse  and  liquidate  eligible \nexpenditures not exceeding $100,000 equivalent per individual payment. The project fund flows \nfor each country are included in Supplementary Appendixes J, K, and L. \n \n \n7.  Accounting Auditing and Reporting \n \n86.  The PCU in Nepal and PMIUs and project implementation units in Nepal, India, and \nBangladesh will maintain separate project accounts in accordance with generally accepted \naccounting principles for all expenditures incurred for the Project, whether funded out of loan or \ngrant proceeds or other sources. They will establish and maintain separate records for works, \ngoods and services financed out of loan proceeds. The participating governments will cause the \ndetailed  consolidated  project  accounts,  as  maintained  by  the  PCU,  PMIUs  and  project \nimplementation untis, to be audited by independent auditors, whose qualifications, experience \nand terms of reference are acceptable to ADB. The use of imprest accounts and statement of \nexpenditures will be part of the annual audit and the audit report should include a separate \nopinion on the use of imprest accounts and statement of expenditures. ADB reserves the right \nto verify the financial accounts of the PCU, PMIUs, and project implementation units to confirm \nthat the share of ADB\u2019s financing is used in accordance with ADB\u2019s policies and procedures. \nThe audited accounts will be submitted to ADB within 6 months of the end of the fiscal year.  \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Review    \n \n87.  The  PCU  in  MOTCA  in  Nepal,  and  the  PMIUs  in  Sikkim  DOT  (India)  and  DOA \n(Bangladesh)  will  be  responsible for  establishing  a  project  performance  monitoring  system \nacceptable to ADB within 3 months of the effectiveness of the loans and grant. The monitoring \nsystem  will  track  project  implementation  activities,  target  dates,  expected  inputs,  impacts, \noutcomes and outputs, and responsibilities, including those for the sustainable heritage and \ntourism action plan.  \n \n ", "  21 \n88.  The PCU in Nepal and the PMIUs in India and Bangladesh will provide ADB with \nquarterly progress reports informing of the national projects' progress. The reports will provide \nsummary financial accounts of the Project including summary account for each implementing \nagency, expenditures to date, and a report on benefit monitoring. An ADB project inception \nmission will be fielded soon after the approval of the loans and grant. Regular review missions \nwill be held twice yearly, with a midterm review in 2012. The midterm review will assess issues \nor weaknesses in implementation arrangements, and agree on changes needed. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS AND RISKS \n \nA.   Economic Analysis \n \n89.  All subprojects have a strong economic rationale since many of the services required     \n(i)  are  natural  monopolies  unsuited  to  unregulated  private  investment,  and  hence  justify \ngovernment intervention; (ii) include environmental protection and sanitation improvement which \nprotects public goods (such as a safe and clean environment) and prevents negative situations \narising from pollution; and (iii) incorporate inclusive approaches that minimize inefficiencies of \neconomic growth. The design of all subprojects were based on sound principles of need and \npriority that support the Project\u2019s primary themes of nature and culture-based tourism including \nBuddhist circuits, incorporate demand forecasts based on local surveys and tourism trends, and \nrepresent the least-cost technically viable options that emphasize rehabilitation or expansion of \ninfrastructure facilities.     \n \n90.  The economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) were estimated to range from 23.76% to \n33.21%,  exceeding  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  and  confirming  the  economic \nrobustness  of  the  proposed  subprojects.  The  overall  EIRR  is  28.27%  demonstrating  the \neconomic viability of the whole Project. A sensitivity analysis, undertaken to further test the \neconomic viability of the subprojects, ascertained that the subprojects are economically robust \nunder most conditions. The results of the sensitivity analysis show that the EIRRs will be highly \nsensitive to a reduction or a delay in benefits. To address these risks, the Project is designed to \nsupport the participating Governments\u2019 coordinated marketing and promotion programs for the \ncircuits developed, as well as skill development programs in local communities to upgrade the \nquality of professional tourism services available.  \n \n91.  A distribution analysis of the quantified benefits from the Project was also conducted. \nThe major stakeholders of the Project are (i) the governments, (ii) labor, and (iii) households, \nincluding  those  comprising  the  nearby  communities  in  the  selected  destination  sites.  The \ngovernments  involved  will  gain  an  estimated  $52.5  million  from  the  Project,  mainly  from \nincreased  tax  revenues  arising  from  increased  incremental  tourist  spending,  as  well  as \npassenger movements. Laborers, both unskilled and skilled, will gain an estimated $37.3 million \nfrom the Project through wage payments and salaries paid by incremental businesses arising \nfrom the increased tourism spending. Households will benefit from the increased number of \ntourists  and  their  expenditures  increasing  by  an  estimated  $17.4  million.  A  subregional \ndistribution analysis was also undertaken (Appendix 9, para. 11). The analysis confirms that \nlabor and households stand to gain substantially from the Project.  \n \n92.  The  poverty  reduction  impact  will  be  higher  in  local  communities  surrounding  the \ndestinations to be improved and made more accessible by the Project. These results can be \ntraced to the inclusive principles embedded in the project design (para. 62). The community \ncapacity  building  and  skill  development  activities  of  the  Project  will  increase  employment \nopportunities particularly for those likely to be engaged in hospitality and heritage tourism \nservices  and  will  enable  nearby  communities  to  maximize  their  local  earnings  from  the \n   ", "22   \nadditional local employment and alternative livelihood opportunities arising from the Project. \nDetails of the economic analysis are in Appendix 9. Economic analyses for each country are in \nSupplementary Appendixes P, Q, and R.  \n \nB.   Financial Analysis   \n \n93.  The financial assessment established that all the executing and implementing agencies \nhave the basic financial reporting, internal controls, and audit systems for the Project. Capacity \nwill be further strengthened by training of staff from executing and implementing agencies in \neach country in accounting, budgeting, financial information management, reporting, and use of \ninformation technology. In addition, indicative financial improvement action plans formulated by \nthe executing and implementing agencies will ensure their subprojects\u2019 financial viability and \nsustainability.  Current  tourism  fees  charged  in  the  destination  sites  are  deemed  low.  The \nindicative financial improvement action plans reflect this and incorporate the need for increased \nrates and new charges to generate sufficient financial revenues to meet the operating needs, \nand potentially the capital investment requirements of the destination sites.       \n \n94.  The financial evaluation of subprojects was undertaken in real terms using constant \n2009 prices. The financial internal rates of return (FIRRs) for the subprojects were estimated to \nrange from 3.72% percent to 9.03%, exceeding the weighted average cost of capital which was \ncalculated to be between 0.19%\u20132.75%. The sensitivity analysis confirms the financial viability \nof the proposed subprojects and the Project as a whole. The results of the sensitivity analysis \nindicate that the FIRRs are most responsive to reductions in the projected financial revenues. \nThe governments\u2019 financial improvement action plans were prepared to mitigate this risk. Details \nof the financial analysis, including the indicative financial improvement action plans are in \nAppendix 9. Country-specific analyses are in Supplementary Appendixes P, Q, and R.  \n \nC.  Social Dimensions \n \n95.  Social.  The  subregion  is  in  a  vulnerable  zone.  Himalayan  regions  are  sensitive \nearthquake zones prone to landslides, while floods and cyclones bring extensive damage to the \nlow-lying areas. Although poverty has decreased in the last 2 decades in the project countries \n(poverty headcount for Nepal at 31%, India at 35%, and Bangladesh at 50%), with the high \npopulation this translates to high absolute poverty. Economic growth and employment are \nnecessary to reduce poverty. Given the extreme climatic conditions and vulnerability of the \nproject countries, new sources of employment must be found by utilizing the strengths of the \ncountries. The Project will contribute to sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty in the \nsubregion  by  developing  environmentally  and  culturally  sustainable  and  socially  inclusive \ntourism,  leading  to  increased  employment,  better  distributed  incomes  and  benefits  to  the \nsubregion\u2019s  communities,  and  enhanced  conservation  and  management  of  the  subregion\u2019s \nnatural and cultural assets. The poverty and social strategy for the Project is summarized in \nAppendix 10. \n    \n96.  Involuntary Resettlement. To ensure compliance with the governments' and ADB's \npolicy and requirements on involuntary resettlement, a full resettlement plan was prepared for \nthe Gautam Buddha airport upgrading component in Nepal, a short resettlement plan has been \nprepared for Rumtek monastery component in India, and a resettlement framework has been \nprepared for future subprojects in Bangladesh (Supplementary Appendix S). The resettlement \nplans outline the involuntary resettlement objectives and strategy for affected persons based on \nnational and state laws and policies of the three countries and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement \nPolicy  (1995).  The  resettlement  plans  provide  a  comparison  of  these  and  address  gaps \n(summarized in Appendix 11). \n ", "  23 \n \n97.  The Project is designed to minimize land acquisition and resettlement impacts. In all \nsubprojects, to the extent possible, works will be within existing facilities on government land. \nFor  the  sample  subproject  in  Bangladesh;  the  West  Sikkim  destination  improvements  and \nHimalayan Training Institute component in India; and the Lumbini improvements in Nepal there \nwill be no land acquisition and resettlement impacts as all works will be within unencroached \nexisting facilities on government land. While most of the Rumtek monastery circuit component in \nIndia and Gautam Buddha airport upgrading in Nepal will be within the existing premises, the \nmultilevel parking and Shanti viewpoint works in Rumtek monastery circuit and the runway \nexpansion in Gautam Buddha airport require land acquisition. \n \n98.  In Rumtek, land acquisition (0.6 hectares) for multilevel parking will affect five people \nand their families. The land is used for agriculture and has one structure (a makeshift pigsty). \nThe  Shanti  viewpoint  has  four  tenants  operating  eateries  and  tea  shops.  They  will  be \ntemporarily  affected  during  construction,  but  will  be  provided  commercial  space  after  the \nconstruction of the viewpoint. In Gautam Buddha airport, strip land acquisition (92.89 hectares) \nwill  affect  590  plots  belonging  to 312  households.  Affected  lands  are  agricultural  with  the \nexception of 17 plots with residential structures. The land acquisition will also affect 132 fruit and \ntimber trees, two primary schools (one private school serving 300 students and one government \nschool serving 500 students), 80 wells, one shrine, and a portion of a poultry farm. Due to the \nproposed expansion, 10 km of village access roads will be disrupted and require reconstruction. \n \nD.  Environment  \n \n99.  To  ensure  compliance  with  the  governments  and  ADB  policy  and  requirements  on \nenvironmental assessment and management, seven Initial Environmental Examinations (IEEs) \nhave been prepared for subprojects in Nepal and India, and a sample subproject in Bangladesh. \nAn environmental assessment and review procedure (EARP) was also prepared for subprojects \nin Bangladesh. These are in Supplementary Appendix T, and summarized in Appendix 12. \nCultural and natural heritage subprojects will have positive environmental impacts particularly in \nand around the sites through the provision of basic infrastructure amenities: water supply, \nsanitation facilities, site drainage, and solid waste management (paras. 29, 39\u201341, and 54). The \nIEEs  also  show  that  while  cultural  and  natural  heritage  subprojects  may  be  sited  in \nenvironmentally  sensitive  areas,  the  works  are  designed  to  result  in  improvements  in \nenvironmental conditions on-site. \n  \n100.  Environmental  impacts  due  to  the  Gautam  Buddha  airport  upgrading  are  largely \nconstruction related\u2014civil construction works associated with the proposed upgrading (para. \n28). There are no impacts on sensitive receptors. The modeling of air and noise impacts due to \nthe air traffic do not indicate significant impacts on surrounding communities, and do not require \nany further assessments or special mitigation measures. Any adverse environmental impact can \nbe  addressed  through  proper  location,  planning,  and  design  of  the  subproject;  control  of \nconstruction  activity;  proper  system  maintenance  following  construction;  and  mitigation \nmeasures. The IEEs prescribe measures to ensure preservation of archaeological sites and \nsensitive ecosystems including careful design in consultation with government and other experts \nsuch as UNESCO, and consistent with masterplans developed, engagement of experts during \nall stages of the Project to ensure mitigating negative impacts, siting improvements only in \nareas designated for ecotourism and outside core areas, and planning construction to ensure \nreduced  risks  to  cultural  and  natural  heritage.  Stakeholders  were  consulted  about  the \nsubprojects and no significant environmental issues were raised. Environmental management \nplans (EMPs) were prepared, and the contract clauses specified in the EMPs will address \nconstruction-related  impacts  and  effectively  minimize  any  adverse  impacts.  Implementation \n   ", "24   \narrangements provide for inputs of environmental specialists at the PCU and PMIUs during \nproject  implementation  to  effectively  implement  the  EMPs,  and  undertake  monitoring  with \nreports submitted periodically to ADB. \n \nE.  Risks \n101.  The main risks of the Project relate to (i) lower than expected market demand for the \ntourism destinations and the passenger arrivals for Gautam Buddha airport, (ii) sustainability of \nheritage  assets  and  tourism  infrastructure  upgraded,  (iii)  suboptimal  benefits  to  local \ncommunities from enhanced heritage management and tourism growth, and (iv) poor project \nimplementation performance resulting in delays and accrual of benefits. The Project addresses \nthese risks through various measures.  \n \n102.  The conservative assumptions used in assessing the tourism market and passenger \ndemands will mitigate the risk of lower than expected market demand. To ensure that the \nprojected  demand  will  materialize  for  the  culture  and  nature-based  tourism  sites  and  the \nconnectivity  infrastructure  upgraded,  the  Project  will  support  a  marketing  and  promotion \nprogram for the multicountry circuits and destinations created.    \n \n103.  The Project will make sure that tourism will not bypass the communities. An awareness-\nraising program will be conducted at the outset of the Project on tourism benefits and the \nlinkage between sustainable heritage management and tourism growth. The Project will support \ncapacity and skill development of communities, as well as pilot schemes for promoting heritage-\nbased tourism livelihood generation. Where available, services of NGOs and other development \npartners  with  experience  in  such  programs  will  be  sought  to  ensure  the  engagement  of \ncommunities in tourism and heritage management.     \n \n104.  Risks to sustainability of the heritage sites will be mitigated by (i) improving protection \nand environmental infrastructure; (ii) enhancing capacities of Nepal\u2019s LDT, Bangladesh\u2019s DOA, \nand India\u2019s DOT of Sikkim, and other stakeholders for heritage management; (iii) supporting the \npreparation  and  implementation  of  management  plans  for  the  heritage  sites;  (iv)  gaining  \ncommunity support for heritage site protection through awareness-raising, and (v) implementing \nrevenue generation reforms to create sustainable sources of funds for managing the sites. All \nthese  will  be  supported  by  the  Project  under  the  capacity  building  component  as  well  as \nsubregional knowledge-sharing activities under the grant-funded regional TA (footnote 3). The \nimplementation progress of the sustainable heritage and tourism action plan will be monitored \nby PMIUs, national project steering committees, and STF which will be supported by ADB \nreview missions maintaining active dialogue with each country during project implementation.  \n \n105.  Finally, the risks for slow project implementation will be mitigated by establishing PCU \nand PMIUs with qualified staff supported by project management and design consultants. In \naddition, the regional TA (footnote 3) commencing before the Project will expose the project \nagencies to ADB procedures and support them in project start-up activities including recruitment \nof project consultants and preparation of initial contracts.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n106.  In addition to the standard assurances, the governments of the participating countries \nhave given the following assurances which are incorporated in the legal agreements subject to \nany amendment to be mutually agreed by the participating governments and ADB. \n \n ", "  25 \n(i)  The governments of the participating countries will ensure that the Sustainable Heritage \nand Tourism Action Plan (Appendix 4) will be implemented.  \n(ii)  The governments of the participating countries will ensure that sufficient funds will be \nprovided to meet any shortfall between the cost of and revenues for the operation and \nmaintenance of the assets created under the Project.  \n(iii)  The governments of the participating countries will ensure that all land and right-of-way \nrequired for the Project are made available in a timely manner; adequate compensations \nare  provided  prior  to  the  signing  of  relevant  civil  works  contracts;  and  involuntary \nresettlement is carried out in accordance with the resettlement plans and resettlement \nframeworks agreed upon between the governments and ADB, the national policies on \nresettlement and land acquisition and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). \nUpdated and all new resettlement plans will be submitted for each subproject to ADB for \nreview and approval following detailed design and prior to award of civil contracts.  \n(iv)  The  governments  of  the  participating  countries  will  ensure  that  the  Project  will  not \nnegatively impact vulnerable groups, such as indigenous peoples. In the event of their \ninvolvement in any of the subprojects, the governments of the participating countries will \nensure that the subprojects comply with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998).  \n(v)  The governments of the participating countries will ensure that the Project considers \ngender issues at all appropriate stages of the Project particularly during design, and that \nthe  Project  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Policy  on  Gender  and \nDevelopment (1998). \n(vi)   The governments of the participating countries will ensure that (a) the Project is carried \nout in accordance with the project design, and construction and operations comply with \napplicable national and local environmental laws and ADB's Environment Policy (2002); \n(b)  the  EARP  prepared  for  subprojects  in  Bangladesh  will  be  followed  to  guide \nenvironmental  assessment  during  implementation;  (c)  archaeological  impact \nassessment will be undertaken prior to award of civil works contracts; (d) the relevant \nenvironmental mitigation measures specified in the EMP are incorporated in tender and \nbidding documents; (e) civil works contractor's specifications include requirements to \ncomply with the environmental mitigation measures contained in the EMP; (f) civil work \ncontractors are closely supervised to ensure proper implementation of mitigation and \nmanagement measures; (g) project environmental performance is monitored; and (h) \nmonitoring reports describing the progress in implementing the applicable environmental \nmitigation measures are submitted annually. \n(vi)  The  governments  of  participating  countries  will  ensure  that  (a)  bidding  documents \ninclude specific provisions to ensure that civil works contractors will comply with core \nlabor  standards  and  labor  laws  and  (b)  civil  works  contractors  will  disseminate \ninformation on sexually transmitted diseases including HIV to their employees and local \ncommunities surrounding the subproject sites. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness  \n \n107.  Apart from regular conditions to loan effectiveness, the loan and the grant to Nepal \nbecome effective only on condition (i) that the Project Agreements with CAAN and LDT have \nbecome legally binding on CAAN and LDT, and (ii) that the loan agreement between the OPEC \nFund for International Development and Nepal has become effective. \n \nC.  Conditions for Disbursement \n  \n108.  Nepal cannot make any withdrawals from the loan account and the grant account until it \nhas furnished a copy of its subsidiary financing agreement with CAAN, in form and substance \nsatisfactory to ADB.     \n   ", "26   \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION  \n \n109.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans and grant would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve: \n \n(i)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 8,234,000 to Nepal \nfor  the  South  Asia  Tourism  Infrastructure  Development  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds resources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter;

South Asia\u2019s Tourism Assets and Subregional Cooperation in Tourism  \n \n1.  South Asia is endowed with diverse and ancient cultural and natural heritage that is \nmore than 5,000 years old; many sites are inscribed in the World Heritage list. It has a rich \ndiversity of ethnic groups with distinctive lifestyles. The region is also the Buddhist heartland, \nwith  many  of  the  world\u2019s  major  Buddhist  sites,  including  ancient  monasteries  and  sacred \nlandscapes associated with the life of Buddha. The region's rich and unique endowments \nposition it as a world destination for nature and culture-based tourism.  \n \n2.  In 2001, a tourism working group (TWG) was formed comprising Nepal, India, Bhutan, \nand Bangladesh under the SASEC Program. The TWG was expanded in 2005 with participation \nof Sri Lanka. The TWG has recognizes that complementary natural and cultural endowments \nprovide an opportunity for regional cooperation in tourism, which can lead to joint product \ndevelopment  and  marketing  with  resulting  enhanced  subregional  tourism.  With  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) support, it developed and adopted a regional Tourism Strategy1  \nproviding a framework for cooperation in tourism. The strategy is based on the principle that \ntourism  should  be  environmentally  and  culturally  sustainable  and  contribute  to  poverty \nreduction. \u201cBuddhist circuits\u201d and \u201cecotourism based on nature and culture\u201d are identified as the \nprimary  themes  of  tourism  development.  Recently  the  TWG  perceived  the  need  for  joint \ndevelopment  of  tourism  infrastructure  and  requested  ADB  support.  ADB  provided  regional \ntechnical assistance (TA)2 to help prepare an investment project.  \n \nB.  South Asia Tourism Patterns and Prospects \n  \n3.  Asia accounts for almost 20% of global international tourists with an estimated 170 \nmillion arrivals in 2006. During 1995\u20132006, South Asian countries\u2019 tourist arrivals grew at an \nannual average of 8%, outperforming many regions of the world and reaching almost double the \nglobal average of 4.8%. The United Nations World Tourism Organization forecasts that the \nSouth Asian countries will receive almost 15 million international visitors by 2020. In 2007, total \ninternational arrivals to Nepal, India, and Bangladesh were around 5.7 million, representing a \n73%  increase  from  2000;  tourism  earnings  from  international  visitors  in  the  three  project \ncountries (including all of India) totaled $12.3 billion, representing a 150% increase from the \nearnings of 2003. India has fuelled the growth. International arrivals to Bangladesh and Nepal \nhave fluctuated during 2000\u20132006; however demand improved in both countries in 2007 with an \nestimated increase in arrivals of at least 6% in Bangladesh and 20% in Nepal. \n \nC.  South Asia Tourism Circuits and Infrastructure Vision \n \n4.  During  the  eighth  meeting  of  the  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation \n(SASEC) TWG in July 2007, TWG representatives considered tourism development priorities in \nthe  subregion  and  the  overlap  of  national  tourism  development  agendas.  Adopting  India\u2019s \napproach  of  using  tourism  circuit  as  a  tool  for  expanding  current  tourism  patterns  and \ncoordinated development and marketing, the TWG conceived a broad pattern for the future of \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008.

Technical Assistance for Preparing the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Tourism \nDevelopment Project. Manila (TA 6362- REG, December, $1.0 million). \n \n   ", "32         Appendix 2 \n \nSouth Asia tourism. The potential subregional circuits (multicountry circuits) were identified on \nthe basis of current and projected demand and flows of tourism, and the envisaged connectivity \nand destination enhancements in the subregion. A multicountry circuit was defined as a route on \nwhich more than one or two major destinations are located in more than one country. In this \nway, a tourist who enters to a destination in one country would be motivated to visit other \ndestinations in the same route located in another country, hence resulting in increased arrivals \nto all destinations in more than one country. The future pattern of tourism in the subregion thus \nenvisages a number of multicountry circuits of nature and culture-based sites and Buddhist \ncircuits that are interlinked. \n \nFigure A2.1: Future Tourism Pattern in South Asia \n \n \n(i)  India and Nepal tourism become intertwined at Lumbini where the \u201cFootsteps of \nLord Buddha\u201d circuit (1) meets a proposed \u201cNepal ecotourism road\u201d circuit (2).  \n \n(ii)  Bagdogra in India becomes not only an air gateway for expansion of India\u2019s \ntourism circuit development patterns into the northeastern states, but also a hub \nfor a \u201cnorth east Himalaya\u201d circuit (3), linking the Himalayan culture, trekking, and \nadventure destinations of Sikkim and Bhutan.  \n \n(iii)  In Bangladesh, a \u201cHeritage Highway\u201d concept creates a new international circuit \n(4) with West Bengal. A former \u201cBhutan-India\u201d (5) circuit is restored, providing \nroad linkage from Bhutan to Assam\u2019s air hub at Guwahati.  \n \n(iv)  Also linking India and Bangladesh, a \u201cBrahmaputra river cruise\u201d circuit (6) to be \ncreated by extending the current Assam cruise pattern down to the sea.  \n \n(v)  As a ribbon running east\u2013west along the northern boundary of the subregion, the \n\u201cgreater Himalayan trail\u201d circuit (7) spreads trekking to the entire length of the \nHimalaya linking remote areas of Nepal, India, and Bhutan.  \n \n ", "      Appendix 2  33 \n \n(vi)  Sri Lanka\u2019s established \u201ccultural triangle\u201d circuit (8) in the central region, and the \nproposed \u201csouthern ecotourism triangle\u201d circuit (9) link wildlife, ecotourism, and \nsignificant Buddhist attractions. \n \n5.  The Vision also provides a prioritization of the circuits based on criteria: (i) market \ndemand, (ii) contribution to national and more importantly to subregional tourism development, \nand (iii) potential for inclusive tourism growth. The market demand criterion refers to the type of \ndemand relevant to the theme of nature and culture-based tourism and Buddhist circuits with \nstrong appeal to target regional and international markets. Contribution to subregional tourism \ndevelopment takes into account the extent to which the circuit is likely to influence incremental \ntourism benefits at national and subregional levels. Higher ranked circuits are those that are \nlikely to generate additional benefits in two or more countries. Contribution to national tourism \ndevelopment priorities relates to the level of importance given by the countries and their private \nsector ascertained through discussions and a review of relevant policies and plans. The criteria \nfor inclusive growth are factored through (i) prioritizing circuits in high poverty areas, (ii) the \nfocus on nature and culture-based tourism with greatest potential to expand the prevailing \ntourism patterns, and (iii) taking into account the national priorities that all aim to use tourism as \na tool for poverty reduction. Special attention is given to links between Buddhist circuits and \nnature and culture-based destinations, and seeking opportunities to develop ecotourism near \nBuddhist sites or to extend Buddhist circuits to include natural and cultural destinations. The aim \nis to consolidate the appeal of tourism products and to expand the subregion\u2019s appeal to new \nmarkets. \nTable A2.1: Subregional Tourism Circuits and Their Ranking \n    Contribution to  Contribution to     \n    Subregional  National Priorities     \n  Market  Tourism  for Tourism  Total  Priority \nCircuit  Demand Development  Development  Scores  Ranking\nCircuit 1 Footsteps of Lord Buddha  3  3  3 \u2013 Nepal; 3 \u2013 India; 1  14  1 \n\u2013 SL; 1 \u2013 Bhutan \nCircuit 7 Great Himalaya Trail  3  3  2 \u2013 Bhutan; 3 \u2013  13  2 \nNepal; 2 \u2013 India \nCircuit 3 North East Himalaya  2  2  3 \u2013 India; 2 - Bhutan;  11  3 \n1 \u2013 Nepal; 1 \u2013 \nBangladesh \nCircuit 4 Bangladesh India Heritage  2  3  3 \u2013 Bangladesh; 1 \u2013  9  4 \nHighway  India \nCircuit 5 Bhutan-India  2  3  2 \u2013 Bhutan; 2 - India  9  5 \nCircuit  8  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  Cultural  3  1  3 - SL  7  6 \nTriangle   \nCircuit 2 Nepal Ecotourism Road  2  2  2 \u2013 Nepal; 1 - India  7  6 \nCircuit 6 Brahmaputra River Cruise  2  2  1 \u2013 Bangladesh; 2 \u2013  7  6 \nIndia \nCircuit  9  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  Southern  2  1  3 \u2013 SL  6  7 \nEcotourism Triangle \n \n6.  The  South  Asia  tourism  circuits  and  infrastructure  vision  also  broadly  provides  the \ninvestment  requirements  along  the  circuits  based  on  an  assessment  of  gaps,  needs,  and \ndemands, and investment prospects undertaken through consultations with governments, the \ntourism industry, and communities. The vision then determines a list of subprojects by reducing \na \u201clong list\u201d through the use of an agreed selection criteria which prioritizes the subprojects that: \n(i) have immediate priority in national tourism plans; (ii) enhance the experience of visitors \nthrough improved destination environment and visitor facilities; (iii) contribute to protection and \nsustainable management of heritage assets of tourism importance; (iv) improve the access to \n   ", "34         Appendix 2 \n \nthe sites and management of visitor movements; (v) promote tourism growth without detriment \nto the environment and tangible and intangible cultural heritage; (vi) have the ability to induce \nprivate sector investments; and (vii) are economically and financially viable. In addition, the \ncriteria seek that the list of subprojects form integrated packages of complementary activities.  \n \n7.   The entire \u201celigible short list\u201d provides a development planning framework for the TWG \nand the basis for phased development and financing of investments.  Activities are classified as \neither:  access  infrastructure;  destination  amenities;  or  capacity  building.  The  access \ninfrastructure  components  are  airports  or  roads.  Destination  infrastructure  includes \nenvironmental and visitor infrastructure and services and site presentation. Capacity building \ninvolves building capacity in (i) communities to participate in tourism and (ii) sector agencies to \nbetter develop and manage the heritage sites, infrastructure, and tourism. The broad estimates \nsuggest that the overall cost of integrated packages of investments is about $300 million. \n \n8.  The Project forms part of the South Asia tourism circuits and infrastructure vision. It \ninvolves integrated development of high-priority infrastructure and services and management \nimprovements in high potential multicountry circuits. Specifically, it includes investments in the \n(i) Nepal portion of the Footsteps of the Lord Buddha circuit cutting across India and Nepal, and \ncombining Lumbini, the birthplace of the Buddha with the Buddhist sites of Uttar Pradesh state \nof India; (ii) the Sikkim State of India which is a premier nature and culture-based tourism \ndestination and Buddhist site that forms part of the greater Himalayan trail circuit, and (iii) the \nBangladesh portion of the heritage highway with key cultural heritage sites along a corridor in \nthe western regions of Bangladesh with established tourist flows from south to north in West \nBengal of India. \n \nD.  Analysis of the Nepal Portion of the Footsteps of the Lord Buddha Circuit  \n \n9.  Buddhist Circuit of Nepal\u2014Lumbini. The Footsteps of the Lord Buddha circuit is the \njewel in the crown of Buddhist circuits that justifies the \u201cBuddhist heartland\" label. The sites in \nthe  Indian  portion  of  the  circuit  are  currently  developed  by  the  Government  of  India  with \nassistance of Japan Bank for International Cooperation. In the Nepal part, Lumbini is the most \npopular attraction and the icon of the Buddhist heartland. Lumbini\u2019s importance stems from the \nSacred Garden that includes the birthplace of Buddha and related archaeological remains and \nstructures e.g., the Maya Devi temple, Ashokan pillar, Nativity sculpture, Puskarini pond, and \nthe Marker Stone which authenticates the exact spot where Buddha was born. The Sacred \nGarden was declared as a World Heritage site in 1997 in recognition of its outstanding universal \nvalue. The Lumbini Development Area covers, in addition to the Sacred Garden, two other \nzones of (i) a monastic enclave and (ii) a cultural and administrative center with museum and \ntourist information center and other facilities. In addition, nine important Buddhist sites are \nlocated around Lumbini Development Area each with values for pilgrimage, sightseeing, and \nhistorical and archeological features.  \n  \n10.  Annual arrivals to Lumbini are estimated to be around 0.5 million, including 71,000 \ninternational tourists from 85 countries. Current key markets include Buddhist pilgrims and \nreligious sightseeing segments from South Asia, Japan, People's Republic of China, Republic of \nKorea, Thailand, and some western countries. As a cornerstone Buddhist attraction, Lumbini \nhas great potential for strong growth in tourism demand. However, its potential is constrained by \nseveral factors that are also the reasons for the current short stay and consequent low spending \nby visitors. \n \n11.  Inadequate  Connectivity.  One  of  the  limitations  of  Lumbini  is  its  remoteness  and \ninadequate connectivity. Currently no direct air links are available to Lumbini from key regional \n ", "      Appendix 2  35 \n \nand international visitor markets; Current air access is through Kathmandu only. There is an \nurgent need to upgrade the Gautam Buddha airport in Bhairahawa (0.5 hour drive from Lumbini) \nto improve access to Lumbini from other airports such as Colombo, Dhaka, Paro, and open up \nlinks to key Southeast Asian and global markets. Such air link will also help link several national \necotourism circuits to this regional Buddhist circuit hence help spread the benefits to a wider \ncommunity.     \n \n12.  Inadequate On-Site Infrastructure and Facilities. Lumbini\u2019s development is guided by \na master plan prepared in 1978 to provide a framework for reinforcing the site\u2019s symbolic \nidentity by defining the land use patterns and requirements for infrastructure, tourist facilities \nand services. However, many of the master plan\u2019s proposals have not been implemented to \ndate due to limited technical, financial, and institutional capacities, as well as the monumental \nnature of the proposals requiring large-scale financing. The inadequate on-site infrastructure \nand services are undermining the cultural value of Lumbini, while adversely affecting the visitor \nexperience. No water supply and toilet facilities are available to meet visitors\u2019 needs. The solid \nwaste management system is inadequate, with garbage collected being either burnt or buried. \nThe visitor center, currently serving in temporary structures, is hindering the proper presentation \nof the site\u2019s outstanding universal value. On-site interpretation including displays and signage \nare  substandard.  Inadequate  landscaping  works,  e.g.,  unpaved  roads  and  lack  of  suitable \nplantation is a source of pollution and contradicts to the required ambience of the Buddha\u2019s birth \nplace. Visitor facilities such as car parking and pedestrian walkways around the visitor center \nare insufficient. Lack of facilities in the site is also a major impediment to generating revenues \nfrom visitors. On-site infrastructure and services need to be improved urgently.   \n \n13.  Institutional Issues. The related institutional structure provides a good framework for \ncoordinated initiatives of various participants in tourism. The key agency responsible for tourism \nis the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation (MOTCA) which reflects the Government\u2019s policy to \npromote tourism and use air transport as an important driver of tourism. MOTCA undertakes its \nactivities through Nepal Tourism Board and Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) both \naffiliated to it. The Nepal Tourism Board is an autonomous entity in the form of a partnership of \nGovernment  and  the  tourism  industry,  and  responsible  for  marketing  and  promotion  and \nproviding overall policy guidance. Lumbini Development Trust (LDT), which is affiliated to the \nMinistry of Culture and State Restructuring, is responsible for developing and managing the \nLumbini area following the Lumbini master plan. LDT is formed as a Trust, an autonomous \nbody, demonstrating Government commitment to Lumbini\u2019s development. CAAN is responsible \nfor regulating air transport and civil aviation, developing and operating airports, and overseeing \nairline operations.    \n  \n14.  However  these  agencies  need  strengthening  to  accomplish  their  mandate.  LDT's \ncapacity needs to be developed for it to effectively perform its complex duties of planning, \ndeveloping, and managing Lumbini; and addressing visitor demands while safeguarding the \nconservation of the Sacred Garden. The sustainable management of Lumbini also requires \nadequate  and  sustainable  revenues  for  financing  its  development,  conservation,  and \nmanagement. There is need to enhance financial management and increase revenues of LDT.  \n \n15.  The current master plan of Lumbini is more than 2 decades old; it was prepared before \nthe Sacred Garden was inscribed in the World Heritage list. Preparation of a management plan \nfor the Sacred Garden is considered an urgent need to protect the outstanding universal value \nof  the  World  Heritage  site  as  an  effective  management  tool.  In  parallel,  the  master  plan \n(covering a larger area) needs to be reviewed and updated to address the multidimensional \nneeds of the site in visitor services, conservation, environmental management; and to adopt \nstrategies for financing and resource mobilization based on contemporary best practices.  \n   ", "36         Appendix 2 \n \n \n16.  Similarly, investments in airport development have to be accompanied with support for \nCAAN's institutional development in line with the objectives of Nepal\u2019s civil aviation strategy. \nManagement skills and capacity, business orientation, and corporate planning within CAAN \nneed to be enhanced with specific focus on the Gautam Buddha airport management.  \n \n17.  Limited Community Engagement in Heritage Management and Tourism. The long-\nterm  conservation  and  sustainability  of  Lumbini  cannot  be  achieved  without  engaging \ncommunities living in its vicinity. The socioeconomic status of surrounding communities is weak \nand the benefits from Lumbini to these communities are limited. In the absence of tangible \nlinkages between Lumbini and its communities, most local inhabitants are indifferent or ignorant \nof the concept of conservation of Lumbini and tourism growth. It is essential to raise the \nawareness of communities in conserving Lumbini, enhancing the attractiveness of the site, and \nthe associated benefits from tourism while creating economic opportunities for them.  \n \nE.  Analysis of Sikkim (Northeast Himalaya Circuit) of India  \n \n18.  Sikkim\u2019s Heritage Tourism. Sikkim is strategically located at the geographic center of \nthe region. It is part of the greater Himalayan trail circuit and the Northeast Himalaya circuit \n(para. 4). It has a good road connection to Bagdogra, a site of an airport, which is soon to be \nupgraded to a regional airport by the Government of India. Bagdogra is the major air node and a \nregional hub with potential links to Bangladesh cultural heritage highway circuit, east Nepal, \nBhutan, and other northeastern states. Sikkim has 107 monasteries, four sacred caves, the \ntallest statue of Guru Rinpoche, and 29 sacred lakes. It is one of India\u2019s premier nature and \nculture-based tourism destinations and has been successful in attracting high-yield domestic \nsegments as well as international trekkers, pilgrims, and nature-based adventure enthusiasts. \nFrom 2002 to 2006 Sikkim experienced 32% annual average growth in foreign arrivals. The \nmain generating markets are United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Japan. \nProvisional figures from the state government of Sikkim indicate that arrivals in 2007 totaled \n17,500 persons. Industry estimates show that about 12,000 of these tourists go trekking in West \nSikkim and around 9,000 visit the \u201cmust-see\u201d Buddhist monastery of Rumtek near Gangtok. The \nplanned upgrading of Bagdogra airport and development of a domestic airport in Gangtok will \nincrease the appeal of Sikkim for international and regional travelers, and strengthen its role in \nsubregional tourism development.  \n \n19.  Government Policy. The state government of Sikkim identifies nature-based tourism, \nas  a  \u201cthrust  industry,\u201d  demonstrating  its  commitment  and  high  priority  attached  to  tourism \ndevelopment. The Department of Tourism is the key state agency for tourism development; \nthrough  planning,  policy  making,  regulation,  and  where  necessary  undertaking  tourism \ninfrastructure development. The Sikkim Tourism Development Corporation, established in 1999, \nprovides and manages tourist facilities and services such as hotel accommodation, restaurants, \nand the Gangtok\u2013Bagdogra helicopter service. The 20-year perspective plan of Sikkim for \nSustainable Tourism Development aims to sustain Sikkim\u2019s position as a premier nature and \nculture-based tourism destination in India. Policy objectives relevant to sustainable tourism are \nalso set out with more focus on making tourism the state\u2019s core competency sector and decisive \nsource of employment and income generation for the benefit of local residents. While nature-\nbased tourism is seen as the key driver, the state also aspires to be a major destination for \nBuddhist tourism, ethnic culture, and adventure tourism in India by 2022. The state realizes that \nthe existing poor access and destination infrastructure constraints tourism development. \n  \n20.  Rumtek  Monastery  Circuit.  The  Rumtek  monastery  is  one  of  the  international \nheadquarters of the Kagyupa sect of Tibetan Buddhism and a well-known monastery located 24 \n ", "      Appendix 2  37 \n \nkm from Gangtok within a forest setting. The monastery is home to a large community of monks, \nand contains the Golden Stupa as well as an institute for higher Buddhist studies. The original \nmonastery, built in the 16th century, is located very close to the Rumtek monastery and has \nunique  architecture;  it  contains  valuable  manuscripts  and  Buddhist  heritage  artifacts.  The \nRumtek monastery receives an estimated 5,000 visitors per day during the peak season, and \nhas  potential  for  growth  in  visitor  numbers.  However,  the  potential  of  the  monastery  to \naccommodate increased numbers of visitors and to sustain its cultural value and environmental \nquality is constrained by several factors. A major constraint is inadequate traffic management \naround the monastery. No organized car parking is available; and the high congestion creates a \ncontrast to the serenity of Rumtek. Water supply, sanitation, and waste management facilities \nare inadequate in the monastery complex. The complex lacks on-site interpretation material and \na visitor information center required to enhance the awareness of visitors on the cultural and \nspiritual  value  of  the  site.  There  is  need  to  provide  the  key  environmental  and  visitor \ninfrastructure. There is also need for developing facade regulations and a guiding framework for \nfuture  development  within  and  outside  the  complex  to  prevent  the  adverse  affects  of \nunregulated development on the authenticity and integrity of the monastery. \n \n21.  Several other key attractions are located in the vicinity of Rumtek, including Lingdum \nMonastery and Ban Jakhri Falls, which are positioned on a potential circuit road connecting \nGangtok\u2013Rumtek Monastry off NH31A above Ranipool\u2013Sajong (Lingdum monastry and Ban \nJakhri Falls)-Gangtok. In addition, the road from Gangtok to Rumtek passes through highly \nscenic landscape such as Shanti and Rey Khola providing opportunities to develop rest stop \nand scenic viewing areas and short walking trails that could help visitors to explore the natural \nenvironment of Rumtek and its vicinity. However due to poor road conditions and supporting \ntourist infrastructure, these places are currently bypassed by current visitor flows. There is great \npotential to expand tourist flows to cover these areas, by improving the access and developing \nrest stops, scenic viewing stations, and waterfront areas.    \n \n22.  Several villages are located along the Rumtek monastery circuit. In the absence of \nadequate linkages, benefits from enhanced tourism in the Rumtek monastery circuit to these \ncommunities remain suboptimal. For example, Rey Mindu, a Lepcha village, located along the \nSadong\u2013Lingdum\u2013Gangtok road, has a unique traditional character and is the starting point of a \ntrek leading into the Flambanglo wildlife sanctuary. The village has significant potential for \nheritage and ecotourism development. However, basic environmental and tourist infrastructure \nalong with community capacity building are needed to link these villages to the major circuits.  \n \n23.  Nature and Culture-Based Tourism in the Himalayas in West Sikkim. About 50% of \ninternational visitors to Sikkim go trekking in West Sikkim. The region has spectacular and \npicturesque nature, and is home to world famous Kanchendzonga national park with hundreds \nof species of flora and fauna. West Sikkim, where the first capital of Sikkim\u2014Yuksam\u2014is \nlocated is also the birthplace of the history and culture of Sikkim. Yuksam is the starting and \ncompletion point for a number of treks mainly into Kanchendzonga National Park (to Dzongri, \nGoechala) and to nearby monasteries, and lakes. Some of the oldest monasteries of Sikkim\u2014\nDubdi, Pemayangste, and Tashiding\u2014are in West Sikkim and form part of the Coronation Trail \nstarting from Yuksam. Yuksam and West Sikkim trails are part of the greater Himalayan trail \ncircuit and offer immense scope to spread tourism benefits to remote communities.  \n \n24.  During the peak season, more than 200 trekkers and campers everyday start their \njourneys from Yuksam, where all the supplies, porters, and guides, serving the trekkers, are \nbased. However, the facilities in Yuksam are limited to meet the tourist needs and ensure \nenvironmental sustainability. There is need for developing  a proper campsite with facilities, \nincluding toilets, kitchen, solid waste management facilities, porter shelters, as well as a tourist \n   ", "38         Appendix 2 \n \ninformation center, and administration facilities in Yuksam. Similarly the main trekking trails in \nWest Sikkim are poorly developed, resulting in safety concerns. Basic amenities, e.g., toilets, \nrest areas, and on-trail campsites with water and sanitation are absent. Besides, inadequate \ncommunity  awareness  and  mobilization,  and  local  skills  in  tourism  activities  and  heritage \nprotection and management are limiting benefits to surrounding villages. Taken together, the \ndeteriorating  sanitary  conditions,  growing  environmental  impacts,  and  limited  community \ninvolvement pose risks to these assets that unless effectively addressed, could result in the loss \nof the assets and markets. There is need for small-scale infrastructure and along select trails \nsuch as stabilization of treks, sanitation and waste management facilities, footbridges, and signs \nalong with programs for community engagement in tourism.   \n \n25.  Sikkim as the Venue of the Himalayan Training Institute for Culture and Nature-\nBased Tourism. Demand is growing in India and the rest of South Asia for a training institute \ndelivering  courses  and  short-term  experiences  on  culture  and  nature-based  tourism \ndevelopment and management for tourism trainers, public and private sector developers and \nmanagers of tourism, tour operators and guides, and interested tourists. Currently, there is no \ninstitute dedicated to nature and culture-based tourism. Such an institute will meet the critical \nneed for human resource development not only in India but the subregion where economies and \npeople\u2019s livelihood largely depend on culture and nature-based tourism. Sikkim, because of (i) \nits central location, (ii) being a key destination for nature and culture-based tourism, and (iii) its \ngood record on sustainable tourism, provides the ideal venue for a subregional institute of \nexcellence.  \n \n26.  Recognizing the need, and based on national and subregional demand for such an \ninstitute, the Government of India, in partnership with Sikkim State, has already initiated a \nproject to develop the Himalayan Training Institute for nature and culture-based tourism in \nChemchey in South Sikkim. The site is easily accessible from Bagdogra, and is about 80 km \nfrom Gangtok. A helipad is available at a distance of about 5 km from the site, enhancing its \naccess and emergency evacuation. The natural scenery around the site comprises valleys, \nmountains, and exotic flora and fauna providing the right environment for such an institute. The \nGovernment has already approved the construction of institute and funds to complete phases 1 \nand 2. However, the institute has not yet been operationalized due to inadequate funding to \ncomplete all the training facilities and provide furnishings and equipment. There is need to \ncomplete the construction of training institute and develop and implement a business plan to \nenable full operation and sustainability of the institute.  \n \n27.  A training institute specialized in nature and culture-based tourism is required under the \nlead of the public sector, to address the needs for (i) ensuring balance between tourism and \nbiodiversity  conservation  in  highly  sensitive  alpine  areas;  (ii)  strengthening  the  planning, \ndevelopment and management skills of the public sector officials to ensure that nature and \nculture-based tourism destinations are developed on a sustainable and inclusive basis; (iii) \nincreasing  the  number  and  quality  of  trained  tourism  professionals  and  guides;  and  (iv) \ndeveloping  the  knowledge  of  the  private  sector  operators  and  community  tourism  service \nproviders for sustainable management of nature and culture-based tourism products.  \n \n28.  Sandruptkse, a place of pilgrimage importance, is located at about 10 km from the site of \nthe Institute. This contains a large statue of Guru Padma Sambhava, an 8th century monk, who \ntraveled  and  taught  in  Sikkim,  and  meditated  at  the  site.  The  work  for  the  statue  was \ninaugurated by the Dalai Lama. An annual festival is organized at the location on the occasion \nof Guru Padmasambhava\u2019s birthday on 10th day of the 6th month of the Tibetan calendar. Many \nvisitors, especially from South Asia visit this place which is also considered critical for the \nmeditation training element of the institute. However, the base of the statue is currently in poor \n ", "      Appendix 2  39 \n \nrepair. Water in the pools around the statue is seeping into the prayer hall below. There is need \nto repair structure of the statue, improve the site, and provide basic tourist amenities. \n \n29.  Village Tourism. The sustainability of nature and culture-based tourism destinations \ncannot be achieved without engaging communities living around these sites. Similarly, benefits \nfrom growing tourism will not automatically be felt by the communities unless special efforts are \nmade  to  enable  their  participation  in  tourism.  It  is  essential  to  raise  the  awareness  of \ncommunities on the importance of protection of heritage sites and linkage between tourism and \nassociated benefits to communities. It is also critical to create economic opportunities for them \nby linking villages to major destinations, and capacity building and skill training of communities \non tourism-related activities building on the best practices that Sikkim has already developed.  \n \nF.  Analysis of Bangladesh Heritage Highway \n \n30.  Cultural Heritage Endowments. The heritage sites along the Bangladesh Heritage \nHighway are culturally very significant. These include Paharpur, Kantajee, Mahastangarh, and \nBagerhat. Paharpur, a world heritage site, is the single largest Buddhist monastery built in the \n8th century. Kantajee is the largest Hindu terracotta temple in the world. Bagerhat, another \nworld heritage site is a mosque complex with a 77 domed mosque and eight other mosques \nnearby. These sites are the most popular attractions, and offer great potential for inclusive \ndevelopment by spreading tourism benefits more widely. Packaging these attractions through \nan innovative concept of a heritage corridor with links to northern and eastern India, and \nimproving  their  access  and  site  conditions  together  with  marketing  will  lead  to  increasing \nnumbers of visitors including Indian tourists, cultural and special interest groups, and wider \ninternational and intraregional segments. \n \n31.  Heritage Site Conditions. These sites are in need of restoration to maintain their \nuniversal  value.  The  lack  of  environmental  infrastructure  e.g.,  drainage  and  solid  waste \nmanagement is undermining the cultural value of the sites while adversely affecting the tourist \nexperience. Visitor facilities such as car parking, internal walkways, and toilets are inadequate \nto cope with demand. The absence of such facilities, causing uncontrolled tourist circulation in \nthe sites, further contributes to degradation of the assets. Site presentations are substandard, \nlimiting the experience of visitors. Nearby communities are able to derive a minimal livelihood \nfrom the sites but this is constrained by lack of infrastructure, information, and skilled people \nwho can get involved in site maintenance and management. These constraints also act as \ndeterrence for the industry to invest and promote these sites.   \n \n32.  Institutional and Financial Issues. The Government first recognized tourism as an \nimportant industry with the framing of the National Tourism Policy in 1992. In 1999, tourism was \ndeclared a thrust sector. The policy recognizes the importance of cultural heritage as the \nprimary  tourism  endowments.  The  Government  also  recently  issued  a  Cultural  policy  with \npreservation of the heritage assets as a core component. The Department of Archeology (DOA) \nis the lead agency for the management of heritage sites in Bangladesh. Other agencies involved \ninclude  the  Ministry  of  Tourism  through  its  Bangladesh  Parjatan  Corporation,  which  is \nresponsible for tourism promotion, provision of visitor information and accommodation services, \nand selected capacity development in tourism. The organizational functions of DOA are spread \nover  four  regional  directorates.  However,  delegation  is  limited,  and  financial  and  technical \npowers are rather centralized. The current staffing and skills are limited. A significant number of \npositions remain vacant, and staff incentives, e.g., promotions are inadequate. The pressure on \nthe staff in managing sites is tremendous, considering that Bangladesh has around 400 heritage \nsites.  \n \n   ", "40         Appendix 2 \n \n33.  Sustainability  of  heritage  sites  is  further  constrained  by  inadequate  maintenance \nbudgets. The average annual investment on cultural properties is Tk30,000 and repair budget is \nestimated at Tk10 million ($150,000). The revenues for a site like Paharpur are substantially \nbelow its cost of operation and maintenance. The primary sources of income for heritage site \nmanagement are visitor fees and income from lease rental and parking arrangements. But these \nare  low  when  compared  with  those  in  neighboring  countries  such  as  India.  Besides,  the \nrevenues  generated  from  the  cultural  heritage  sites  are  not  retained  by  DOA.  Sources  of \nincomes need to be increased by increasing existing tourist fees and introducing new fees. \nDedicated funds need to be created for site management by exploring options to enable DOA to \nretain the revenues for the operation and maintenance of sites.   \n        \n   \n ", "      Appendix 3  41 \n \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE FOR TOURISM IN ASIA \n \n  Year   \nAmount \nProject  Approved  Source \nA.

An economic and financial analysis was conducted in accordance with the following \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) guidelines: Tourism for Pro-Poor and Sustainable Growth: \nEconomic  Analysis  of  Tourism  Projects,1Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects,2 \nGuidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects,3  and  Framework  for  the  Economic  and \nFinancial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector Projects.4 The analysis was undertaken by \ncomparing  the  incremental  benefits  and  costs  arising  from  the  with-  and  without-project \nscenarios.       \n \nA.  Economic Analysis \n \n  1.  Country Economies and the Sector \n \n2.  Subregion Economies and Tourism. Tourism plays a pivotal role in the subregion \neconomies. According to the World Travel & Tourism Council, the tourism industry\u2019s direct \nimpact on the economies of Bangladesh, India, and Nepal will reach a combined total of  \n$29.5 billion, equivalent to 1.6%\u20133.1% of their gross domestic product (GDP). The council \nindicates  that  tourism\u2019s  contribution  to  GDP  will  reach  4%  or  $6,385  million  by  2018  in \nBangladesh, 6.1% or $172 billion in India, and 8% or $1,173 million in Nepal. But to achieve or \neven surpass these forecasts, the governments will have to address constraints to the tourism \nindustry. The often-cited tourism development bottlenecks in the three countries include (i) \ndifficulties with connectivity and access to the sites, (ii) inadequate infrastructure and visitor \nfacilities, (iii) insufficient human resources and trained professional staff, (iv) relatively weak \nborder crossing infrastructure and systems, (v) inadequate basic infrastructure such as water \nsupply and sanitation systems, and (vi) limited benefits to surrounding communities.  \n \n  2.  Project Rationale \n \n3.  Justification for Government Intervention in the Sector. Fostering private sector \nparticipation  is  a  vital  element  of  each  government\u2019s  tourism  development  strategy. \nNonetheless, airport upgrading and the provision of public toilets, public footpaths, drainage, \nand public information centres justify government intervention for the following reasons: (i) many \nof the services required are natural monopolies usually unsuited to private investment and \nhence, justify government intervention at least in regulation; (ii) environmental protection and \nsanitation improvement provide public goods such as a hygienic and flood-free environment, \nand prevent negative situations arising from pollution; and (iii) poverty reduction programs \nminimize  the  inefficiencies  of  economic  growth.  The  economic  rationale  for  government \nintervention is, therefore, sound. \n \n  3.  Demand Analysis \n \n4.  During 1995\u20132006, tourist arrivals of member countries of the South Asia Subregional \nEconomic Cooperation grew at an annual average of 8%, outperforming many regions of the \nworld and reaching almost double the global average of 4.8%. The United Nations World \nTourism Organization forecasts that these countries will receive almost 15 million international \nvisitors by 2020. However, demand forecasts show that without the Project, growth will be \nlower, or worse, demand for tourism in the subproject areas will gradually decline because of (i) \nthe diminishing attractiveness of the sites due to major physical constraints that will worsen over \n                                                 \n1  Tun Lin and F.D. de Guzman. 2007.

To arrive at \ndemand forecasts for each of the subprojects, surveys of tourist arrivals, duration of stay, and \naverage spending in the destination sites were conducted with assistance from the local tourism \noffices in each participating country.  \n \n  4.  Cost\u2013Benefit Analysis \n \n    a.   Economic Costs \n \n5.  In  calculating  the  economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the  subprojects,  the \nestimated  costs  and  benefits  were  valued  at  their  economic  prices  using  the  world  price \nnumeraire. The standard conversion factors used were taken from recent ADB studies on South \nAsia of a similar nature5 and confirmed using available import and export data from each \ncountry. The conversion factors used were as follows: Bangladesh (0.90); India (0.91), and \nNepal (0.89). The economic costs do not include applicable taxes and duties, and are based on \npreliminary engineering designs and estimates prepared for the subprojects.  \n   \n    b.  Quantified Economic Benefits \n \n6.  Incremental  Tourism  Benefits.  Tourism  benefits  from  subprojects  were  calculated \nbased on the increased (i) number of passenger or tourist arrivals as a result of the subprojects, \n(ii) length of tourist stays in the area, and (iii) amount of spending by tourists. The following \nincome  multipliers  were  applied:  Bangladesh  (0.63),  India  (0.93),  and  Nepal  (0.76).6  The \ndemand surveys conducted indicate that as a result of the subprojects, average daily tourism \nspending will increase. Based on the increase estimated for each destination site, average daily \ntourism benefits were determined taking into account the substitution effect.7   \n \n7.  Incremental  Airport  Benefits.  Using  projected  incremental  passenger  arrivals  and \naircraft movements, passenger and landing fees for relevant subprojects were calculated and \nconverted  into  economic  benefits by  applying  the  appropriate  standard  conversion  factors. \nAdditional benefits such as airport revenues from parking facilities and cargo services were \ncomputed at 5% of the total incremental tourism and airport benefits.  \n \n    c.  Nonquantified Economic Benefits \n \n8.  Other Benefits. The analysis did not quantify other benefits that were difficult to value \ndue to lack of data or the potential for double counting. These nonquantified benefits include \n(i) aircraft operating cost savings, (ii) increased public health due to improved water supply and \nsanitation  facilities  in  the  site,  and  (iii)  access  to  increased  employment  and  livelihood \nopportunities in the communities surrounding the destination sites.    \n \n  d.  EIRR Calculation and Sensitivity Analysis \n \n9.  The results of the EIRR calculation and sensitivity analysis are summarized in Table \nA9.1. The base case EIRRs range from 23.76% to 33.21%, exceeding the economic opportunity \n                                                 \n5  See for example ADB. 2005.

A sensitivity analysis, undertaken to further test the economic viability of the subprojects \nand the Project, ascertained the consequences of changes in the following variables: (i) 10% \nincrease in investment cost possibly arising from a delayed implementation schedule or higher \nthan expected inflation, (ii) 10% decline in benefits due to lower tourist arrivals and spending \nthat may result from the global economic slowdown, (iii) a combination of scenarios (i) and (ii), \nand (iv) a delay in subproject benefits by a year. The results of the sensitivity analysis show that \nthe EIRRs are highly sensitive to a reduction or a delay in benefits. To address this risk, \nsubprojects  were  selected  using  a  set  of  criteria  that  emphasized  both  contribution  to \nsubregional and national tourism development. The Project is also designed to support the \nparticipating governments\u2019 coordinated marketing and promotion programs for the proposed \ncircuits.   \n \nTable A9.1: Summary of Economic Internal Rates of Return and Sensitivity Analysis \nSubproject\nPaharpur Lumbini\nProject\nBase Case/Sensitivity Scenarios Heritage Site Bhairahawa Heritage Site Sikkim \nImprovements Airport Upgrading Improvements Improvements\nEconomic Cost 1,565.00 20,807.00 2,663.00 17,576.00 42,611.00\n($'000)\nNet Present Value 2,365.00 25,919.00 6,370.00 42,183.00 73,993.00\n($'000)\nBase Case EIRR (%)     30.72      23.76    34.69       33.21      28.27\nSensitivity Tests:\nCase 1:  Capital Cost + 10% \nEIRR (%)     28.53      22.43   32.54        31.22      26.64\nSwitching Value     85.40       88.51 105.18       106.70      99.90\nSensitivity Indicator       1.17       1.13     0.95          0.94       1.00\nCase 2:  Benefits - 10% \nEIRR (%)      28.08       22.25     31.94       30.88      26.37\nSwitching Value     71.10       77.76     82.52       91.04      85.63\nSensitivity Indicator       1.41         1.29        1.21         1.10        1.17\nCase 3:  1, 2 & O&M+10%\nEIRR (%)     25.87      20.93     26.62        28.91       24.73\nNPV ($'000) 1,843.00 19,917.00 5,158.00 34,889.00 59,247.00\n% Drop in NPV     22.08      23.16     19.03        27.43       19.92\nCase 4:  Benefits delayed by 1 yr\nEIRR (%)    16.07       21.05      19.30        20.02       24.42\nNPV ($'000)  741.00 21,295.00 2,858.00 21,783.00 62,057.00\n% Change in NPV    68.68       17.84     55.14        98.70       16.12  \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return; NPV = net present value; O&M = operation and maintenance; NPV = net \npresent value. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n5.   Benefit Distribution and Poverty Impact Analysis \n \n11.  A distribution analysis of the quantified benefits from the Project was conducted. India \nwill gain most from the Project with an estimated $52.2 million in net benefits. Nepal will gain \napproximately $39.1 million, while the net benefit to Bangladesh will be about $16.1 million. \nThese results reflect findings that the economic impact of tourism, as measured by its income \nmultiplier, is highest in India, followed by Nepal (para. 6).9 The net benefit to Bangladesh is \nsmallest due to its lower income multiplier, which can be traced, in part, to the relatively limited \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2003.

The  poverty  reduction  impact  will  be  higher  in  local  communities  and  villages \nsurrounding the destination sites. Skills development to be carried out in each participating \ncountry will increase employment and livelihood opportunities particularly for those likely to be \nengaged in hospitality, guesthouse and small hotel services, food and beverages, handicrafts, \nlocal  tours,  cultural  presentations,  marketing,  interpretation,  and  other  microenterprise \nendeavors.  The  detailed  economic  analyses  for  three  countries  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendixes P, Q, and R.   \n \nB.  Financial Analysis \n \n1.  Financial Management Assessment \n                              \n \n13.  To ensure that the Project\u2019s implementing agencies are managerially and financially \ncapable  of efficiently  and  effectively  implementing  the  proposed  subprojects\u2015consequently \npromoting  project  sustainability\u2015a  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects  (footnote  3).  The \nfinancial assessment established that all the executing and implementing agencies have the \nbasic financial reporting, internal controls, and audit systems for the Project. Capacities will be \nstrengthened under the Project by training executing and implementing agency staff in each \ncountry on accounting, budgeting, financial information management, reporting, and use of \ninformation technology.  \n \n2.  Indicative Financial Improvement Action Plans \n \n14.  The  Government  of  Bangladesh  has  decided  on  the  following  action  agenda:  (i) \ncomplete filling of key vacancies, and prepare and start implementation of an action plan to \ninduct staff by December 2009; (ii) prepare an action plan and begin implementation to increase \nincome from various sources including entrance fees, user charges for facilities, parking fees, \nconcession fees, and sale of interpretative materials to generate sufficient funds to gradually \nmeet operation and maintenance (O&M) costs of the sites by June 2012; and (iv) devise a \nfeasible mechanism to allow revenues generated from the sites to be used for O&M, while \nimplementing a rational policy to support sites with lower revenue realization by June 2012.   \n \n15.  The  Sikkim  state  government  has  decided  to  (i)  assess  the  feasibility,  and  start \nimplementation of a strategy for separately accounting and managing revenues for nature- and \nculture-based  tourism  by  June  2012;  and  (ii)  develop  and  start  implementing  a  financial \nimprovement action plan involving enhanced ecotourism service fees, other fees and charges to \nmeet O&M costs of the Rumtek monastery complex and facilities, as well as proposed tourism \nproducts by June 2012.  \n \n16.  The  Government  of  Nepal  has  committed  to  pursue  the  following:  (i)  prepare  and \nendorse a policy statement and guidelines acceptable to ADB to eliminate outstanding charges \nto CAAN by July 2010; (ii) reduce overall outstanding dues of CAAN to 30% by June 2012;  \n(iii)  prepare  and  start  implementing  a  business  plan  for  the  Gautam  Buddha  airport  by \nDecember 2010, including setting of aeronautical and nonaeronautical rates by January 2014 \nand every year thereafter; and (iv) design, install, and operate a financial management reporting \nsystem  for  the  Gautam  Buddha  airport  linking  it  with  the  overall  management  information \nsystem of CAAN by December 2010.  \n \n17.   Management of Lumbini Development Trust (LDT) in Nepal will implement the following \naction  agenda:  (i)  develop  an  action  plan  and  start  implementing  measures  for  enhanced \nstrategic planning, heritage protection, visitor management, environmental management, O&M \n ", "    Appendix 9  61 \nof  infrastructure,  and  engagement  of  communities  in  heritage  tourism  by  Jan  2011;  and  \n(ii)  develop  and  implement  a  financial  improvement  action  plan  to  gradually  enhance  the \nrevenues and financial management of LDT by June 2012, including an annual revision of the \nstructures and rates of fees, and charges for various services to meet O&M expenses.     \n \n \n3.  Cost\u2013Benefit Analysis   \n \n18.  Capital  investment  costs,  valued  at  constant  2008  prices,  were  considered  in  the \nanalysis. Recurrent annual expenses to support O&M were calculated at 3% of the total civil \nworks cost. Using the visitor forecasts prepared for each subproject as part of the demand \nanalysis (para. 4), financial revenue projections were prepared based on the indicative lease \nand fee rates proposed by the implementing agencies.  \n \n19.  Table 9.2 presents the results of the calculation of financial internal rates of return \n(FIRRs) and sensitivity analysis. The base case FIRRs for the subprojects are estimated to \nrange from 3.72% to 9.03%, exceeding the weighted average costs of capital calculated at \n0.19%  to  2.75%.  The  sensitivity  analysis  performed  confirms  the  financial  viability  of  the \nsubprojects and the Project as a whole. The results of the sensitivity analysis indicate that the \nFIRRs are most responsive to reductions in the projected financial revenues. The governments\u2019 \nfinancial improvement action plans will address this risk sufficiently (paras. 14\u201317).

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nSouth Asia, with a population of 1.2 billion is in a vulnerable zone. This includes the project countries of Nepal, India, and \nBangladesh. Himalayan regions of the countries are in a sensitive earthquake zone, prone to landslides. Floods and cyclones \nbring extensive damage to Bangladesh. While poverty levels have improved in the last two decades in the four countries \n(poverty headcount for Nepal at 31%, India at 35%, and Bangladesh at 50%), with the high population\u2014this translates to high \nlevels of absolute poverty. Country poverty assessments, country partnership strategies, and sector analyses for these \ncountries show that economic growth and employment are necessary to reduce poverty. Given the extreme weather \nconditions and vulnerability of the project countries, there is a need tap new sources of employment which will harness the \nstrengths of the countries.  \n \nDespite high levels of poverty, the subregion has a remarkable combination of potentials. The project countries are endowed \nwith vast and diverse cultural and natural resources that give them the opportunity to build a globally competitive tourism \nsector.  Tourism  contributes  to  the  project  countries\u2019  national  and  local  economies.  In  2007,  tourism  earnings  from \ninternational visitors in the three countries (including entire India) totaled $12.3 billion, representing a 150% \nincrease from the tourism earnings of 2003. According to World Travel and Tourism Council\u2019s statistics tourism employed \n13.7 million people in the three countries. However there is substantial scope to further enhance the contribution of tourism to \neconomic growth and job creation through enhancing (i) connectivity to and destination infrastructure in remote tourism assets \n(ii) public sector capacities to manage heritage tourism and (iii) engagement of communities in heritage site protection and \nmanagement and the tourism economy.  \n \nThe Project will contribute to sustainable economic growth and reduced poverty in the subregion through the development of \nenvironmentally and culturally sustainable and socially inclusive tourism, leading to increased employment, increased and \nbetter distributed incomes and benefits to the subregion\u2019s communities, and enhanced conservation and management of the \nsubregion\u2019s natural and cultural resources. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nThe Project will strengthen the tourism sector as reflected in an increase in arrivals and length of stay of tourists in the \nsubregion and increased spending of tourists and expanded patterns of existing tourist flows. All these are expected to result \nin additional employment and improved living conditions for the local populations including the poor. Subprojects are designed \nto further reach the poor.  \n \nIn Nepal, tourism is an important sector for the economy and the proposed subprojects in and around Lumbini will increase \nalternative livelihoods for the population. Poverty in the Terai is 28%. In India\u2019s Sikkim, the poverty levels are around 36%. \nThe nature and culture-based tourism and village tourism will provide additional employment to the rural communities and \nimprove their environmental and accessibility conditions. The proposed training center will result in indirect employment in the \nsurrounding  communities.  In  Bangladesh,  infrastructure  development  will  support  local  livelihood,  and  the  proposed \nimprovements and restoration of cultural sites will increase tourist flows to benefit the local community. With constant threats \nfrom natural elements, alternative livelihood is required in these areas of the country (Rajshahi, Bogra and Dinajpur) where \npoverty levels are as high as 65% (in rural Rajshahi division). \n2. Design Features \n \nWhile the Project will improve destinations and access, it also aims to expand access to livelihoods directly through project-\nbased activities such as construction, and through structured efforts to promote community-based eco and cultural tourism \nactivities and community-based management of select sites. To enable communities, the project will have capacity building \nactivities to foster community involvement, and provide support in designing community-based tourism products. \n ", "Appendix 10  63 \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThere has been progress in the achievements of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) targets in the three countries. \nNepal\u2019s 2005 MDG Progress Report indicated that Nepal was likely or potentially able to meet MDG goals except universal \nprimary education and HIV/AIDS. India on the other hand has been cited by the Millennium Progress Report as leading \npoverty reduction as \u201cwith more than 2.3 billion people in these two countries (People's Republic of China and India) alone, \ntheir major advances in poverty reduction drive developing world averages.\u201d The 11th Five Year Plan of India have goals and \nprograms more ambitious than the MDGs targets. Finally, UNDP\u2019s MDG Monitor reflects that Bangladesh is on track in \nrelation to most targets already achieving gender parity in primary and secondary education, and in wage employment in the \nnon-agriculture sector. \n \nThe achievement of the MDGs has been boosted by economic growth, which is expected to grow at a less rapid pace as a \nresult of the global slowdown. This can worsen unemployment. While employment rates have been increasing in Bangladesh \nand India, at the current rates of 4.2% and 3.1% respectively\u2014this translates to about 14 million individuals who are \nunemployed. While Nepal employment statistics are unavailable, studies estimate it in the region of 40% of labor force.  \nSustained economic growth and employment generation are key factors in further achieving MDG targets and achieving \ndevelopment. The Project is expected to enable the countries to earn more foreign exchange, generate additional jobs, and \nimprove total economic output. It is estimated that the Project will benefit an overall 2.4 million people through increased \nincomes, employment, health and environmental improvements, and reduced travel time. Around 500,000 people will benefit \nfrom additional employment both in the tourism industry and the industries related to tourism. At least 10,000 local livelihoods \nwill be created improving the lives of communities around the sites. The capacity building activities will equip around 250 \npractitioners with skills for enhanced protection, management, and marketing of key destinations in the three countries.     \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nExtensive consultations were held with stakeholders. As select activities will be community-based, willingness to participate \nand manage assets is one of the key requirements in subproject selection. The Project is designed to be inclusive, hence \ncommunity capacity building, is part of the Project, including participatory processes. A stakeholder analysis was undertaken \nparticularly for community based tourism subprojects. Key stakeholders identified were communities, NGOs, self-help groups \nand the government agencies. The perceptions were obtained through focus group discussions, individual interviews, and \ngroup meetings to assess the income and other benefits from the investments, the needs and willingness to participate in \nservice and site management. These were considered in the project design.  \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nWomen and men will benefit from the Project, through improved opportunities for income generation, directly as part of the \ncommunity-based  tourism  activities,  and  indirectly  through  increase  employment  from  increased  tourist  inflows.  The \nimprovement of tourist infrastructure and amenities will also result in general benefits to communities, including women.  \nGiven that the project provides for harnessing local handicrafts and potentials for community based tourism, it will positively \nbenefit women entrepreneurs. \n  \n2.

The Project promotes environmentally and culturally sustainable and socially inclusive \ntourism growth in the South Asian subregion. This will be through: (i) integrated development of \nhigh  yielding  tourism  circuits  and  destinations,  (ii)  effective  management  of  tourism  and \nenvironment and culture, and (iii) enhancing the linkages of expanded tourism to the local \ncommunities. These will be undertaken in three countries.1 \n \n2.  The Project is designed to minimize land acquisition and resettlement impacts. In all \nsubprojects, to the extent possible, works will be within existing facilities which is government \nland. For the Lumbini subproject in Nepal; the Chemchey, Singalila, Yuksom, and Himalayan \nInstitute of Ecotourism and Mountaineering subprojects in India; and the sample-subproject in \nBangladesh\u2014there will be no land acquisition and resettlement impacts as all works will be \nwithin un-encroached existing facilities which is government land. While most of the Gautam \nBuddha airport improvement in Nepal, and the Rumtek monastery subproject works in India will \nbe within existing facilities, the runway expansion in Gautam Buddha airport, and the parking lot \nand Shanti view point works in Rumtek require land acquisition. \n \n3.  In the Gautam Buddha airport, strip land acquisition (92.89 hectares) will affect 590 plots \nbelonging to 312 households. Affected lands are agricultural with the exception of 17 residential \nplots with residential structures. The land acquisition will also affect 132 fruit and timber trees, \ntwo primary schools (one private school and one Government School) serving 300 and 500 \nstudents respectively, 80 wells, 1 shrine, and a portion of a poultry farm. Due to the proposed \nexpansion,  10  kilometers  of  village  access  roads  will  be  disrupted  and  will  require \nreconstruction.  Of  the  312  affected  households    in  Gautam  Buddha  airport,  68  affected \nhouseholds are vulnerable: 7 Affected households are headed by women, and 61 affected \nhouseholds are poor Dalit/Janjati whose livelihood is land-based. In Rumtek, land acquisition \n(0.6 hectares) for multi-level parking will affect 5 brothers and their families. The land is used for \nagriculture and has one structure (a makeshift pigsty). The Shanti view point has four tenants \noperating eateries and tea shops. They will be temporarily affected during construction, but will \nbe provided commercial space after the re-construction of the view point. Detailed design will \nfurther  consider  subproject  siting  and  alignment  to  further  minimize  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  impacts.  A  full  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  for  the  airport,  a  short \nresettlement plan has been prepared for Rumtek, and a resettlement framework has been \nprepared for future subprojects in Bangladesh (Supplementary Appendix T).  \n \nB.  Objectives, Policy Framework and Entitlements \n \n4.  The  resettlement  plans  are  summarized  in  this  document.  The  resettlement  plans \noutline  the  involuntary  resettlement  objectives  and  strategy  for  affected  persons  based  on \nnational and state laws and policies of the three countries and the Asian Development Bank's \n(ADB\u2019s) Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, 1995. The resettlement plans provide a comparison \nof these documents and addresses gaps. \n \n5.  Core involuntary resettlement principles for the Project are: (i) acquisition of land will be \nminimized and will avoid the resettlement of people, as much as possible; (ii) local stakeholders \nwill  be  systematically  informed  and  properly  consulted    to  identify  the  possible  alternative \nsubproject engineering and operational solutions to avoid or minimize the adverse impacts of \nland acquisition; and disclosure to the public regarding the preparation of resettlement plans, \n                                                 \n1  Components per country are described in the main text paras 28-29, 38 to 44, and 53-54.  \n ", "66  Appendix 11 \n \neligibility of affected persons, compensation, entitlements and special assistance measures to \nvulnerable groups will be undertaken; (iii) all affected persons will be properly identified and \nrecorded in a census instrument in which cut-off date for their eligibility is the last day of the \nsurvey in the subproject area, and will be notified in advance when land for the subproject will \nbe acquired; (iv) lack of formal legal rights to the assets lost will not prevent affected persons \nfrom receiving compensation, entitlement and rehabilitation measures; (v) where resettlement \ncannot be avoided, relocation site(s) whether permanent or temporary, free from environmental \nrisks and with access to drinking water and sanitation, social services and all other services \naccessible in the previous location, will be provided prior to relocation, in consultation with \naffected persons and their hosts; (vi) relocated affected persons will be provided with assistance \nto maintain, or improve their pre-subproject living standards, income earning capacity and \nproduction  levels;  (vii)  special  assistance  measures  will  be  incorporated  in  resettlement \nimplementation process to protect the socially and economically vulnerable groups that will be \naffected;2 (viii) effective mechanism for arbitration of complaints and grievances will be provided \nduring resettlement implementation; (ix) institutional arrangements and human resources will be \nin place for consultation, liaison, land acquisition, resettlement and monitoring to ensure the \neffective  resettlement  implementation  prior  to  commencement  of  the  subproject;  and  (x) \npayment  of  compensation  prior  to  displacement  must  be  provided,  and  other  resettlement \nassistance initiated prior to award of civil works contract.

Consultation and Grievance Redress Participation \n \n6.  The resettlement plans were prepared in consultation with stakeholders. For the Gautam \nBuddha airport, consultations employing various methods (household sample surveys with 275 \nrespondents, and focus group discussions with affected persons (June 2008) have been carried \nout.  In  addition,  key  informant  interviews  including  affected  persons  (including  vulnerable \naffected persons), village heads, and government agency representatives have been carried \nout. In line with the requirements of the Government of Nepal, public hearing to disclose and \ndiscuss the subproject and safeguards in communities, involving affected persons and other \nstakeholders, has been undertaken (March 2008). The issues raised were addressed in the \nsafeguard documents. Subsequent to preparation of draft safeguard documents, consultations \nwere  undertaken  in  July  2008  involving  stakeholders  to  disclose  and  discuss  safeguards \ndocuments in local language. For Rumtek, consultations included focus group discussions with \nthe affected persons at Shanti view point, and on-site interviews and household surveys for the \n5 affected households (September 2008). Feedback was reflected in subproject design.33. \n \n7.  The  resettlement  plans  for  Nepal  and  India,  and  the  resettlement  framework  for \nBangladesh will be made available in relevant local government agencies, and the Project \nManagement  and  Implementation  Unit  (PMIU).  The  resettlement  plan  will  also  be  made \navailable in the website of the Executing Agencies (EAs). The resettlement plan will also be \ndisclosed  in  ADB\u2019s  website;  and  information  dissemination  and  consultation  will  continue \nthroughout Project implementation. \n \n8.  Grievances of affected persons will first be brought to the attention of the project social \ndevelopment  specialist  (SDS).  Grievances  not  redressed  will  be  brought  to  the  grievance \n                                                 \n3  Based on the feedback received during consultations, designs have been revised to enable the AHs to retain the \nfrontage of 30m from the road line, which they wanted to keep for future residential construction.  \n ", "Appendix 11  69  \nredress committee (GRC). The GRC will meet every month (if grievances are brought to the \nCommittee), determine the merit of each grievance, and resolve grievances within a month of \nreceiving the complaint\u2014failing which the grievance can be appealed with the GRC. Further \ngrievances will be referred by affected persons to the appropriate courts of law. The project \nmanagement  and  implementation  unit  (PMIU)  will  keep  records  of  all  grievances  received \nincluding: contact details of complainant, date the complaint was received, nature of grievance, \nagreed corrective actions and the date these were effected, and final outcome. \n \nD.  Compensation, Relocation and Income Restoration \n \n9.  Loss of land, structure, assets, trees, and crops will be at replacement cost. Details are \nin the resettlement plans. Vulnerable households will be provided additional assistance in the \nform of land-for-land replacement options, prioritization in project employment, and an additional \nallowance for land and structure losses. Income losses are anticipated to be minimal and \ntemporary. Income restoration activities include the provision of short-term allowances and \nrestoration of access to livelihood activities. \n \nE.  Institutional Framework \n \n10.  The  Ministry  of  Tourism  and  Civil  Aviation,  Department  of  Tourism,  Sikkim;  and \nDepartment of Archaeology; are the EAs for Nepal, India, and Bangladesh, respectively. For \nNepal, a project coordination unit (PCU) for implementing the project at the national level will be \nestablished within the EA. Within the PCU, a safeguards coordinator will oversee and manage \nsocial issues and social safeguards. The safeguards coordinator will ensure that all subprojects \ncomply with Government and ADB policies. NGOs or consultants will be engaged to implement \nthe  resettlement  plans.  Design,  Supervision,  and  Management  Consultants  (DMS)  will  be \nrecruited by the PCU to provide assistance to the PMIUs. In India and Bangladesh, these tasks \nwill be within the PMIU. A Social Development Specialist (SDS) from the DMS will finalize \n(during detailed design stage) and implement resettlement plans, and monitor resettlement plan \nimplementation. \n \nF.  Resettlement Budget, Financing and Implementation Schedule \n \n11.  The detailed budget estimates for involuntary resettlement is in the resettlement plan, \nwhich the EA will include in the overall project cost estimate. The budget will include (i) detailed \ncosts  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  assistance,  (ii)  source  of  funding,  and  (iii) \narrangements for approval, and the flow of funds and contingency arrangements. All land \nacquisition funds will be provided by the EA. All land acquisition and resettlement assistance will \nbe considered as an integral component of project costs. The EA will keep the provisional \nbudget in advance in its annual plan for the cost of land acquisition and resettlement. The \nresettlement cost in the resettlement plan includes a contingency of 10% of the total cost in \norder  to  adjust  any  deviation  in  the  project  implementation.  General  resettlement \nimplementation is schedule for 12 months with detailed implementation schedules in each \nresettlement plan. \n \nG.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n12.  Monitoring  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  SDS.  Monitoring  indicators  have  been \nidentified in the resettlement plan. Monitoring and evaluation reports documenting progress on \nresettlement implementation and the completion report will be provided by the EA to ADB for \nreview. The monitoring reports will be submitted quarterly to ADB.  \n ", "70  Appendix 12 \n \nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATIONS \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The Project promotes environmentally and culturally sustainable and socially inclusive \ntourism growth in the South Asian subregion. This will be through: (i) integrated development of \nhigh  yielding  tourism  circuits  and  destinations,  (ii)  effective  management  of  tourism  and \nenvironment and culture, and (iii) enhancing the linkages of expanded tourism to the local \ncommunities in three countries. Components per country are described in the main text paras \n28\u201329, 38\u201344, and 53\u201354. Initial environmental examinations (IEE) for subprojects in Nepal and \nIndia; and an Environmental Assessment and Review Procedure (EARP)1 and an IEE for a \nsample-subproject in Bangladesh2 were prepared (Supplementary Appendix T). The IEEs were \nbased on a review of subproject site plans and reports3; field visits; primary and secondary data \nto characterize the environment and identify potential impacts; and interviews and discussions \nwith stakeholders. Salient points from the IEEs are summarized below. \n \nB.  Description of the Environment  \n \n2.  Nepal Subprojects. The Gautam Buddha airport and Lumbini subproject sites are in the \nflat terai region, is geologically stable with no major faults in the vicinity. There are neither any \nweak rocks nor any history of subsidence of land. The soil of the area comprises loose soils \nrepresented by silt, clay and sand. In the Gautam Buddha airport the Ghaghar Khola stream \nwhich supports common species in the rainy season flows where the runway will be extended.4 \nLand use is predominantly agricultural. All flora and fauna are common species and there are \nno protected areas in and around the site. In Lumbini works will be outside of the sacred garden \narea which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and outside of the Crane and Bird Sanctuary.5  \n \n3.  India Subprojects. The subprojects are in the eastern, southern and western districts of \nSikkim, which is part of inner ranges of Himalayan mountains with no open valley or plains but \nof varied elevations ranging from 300 to 8,585 m. The eastern and western districts constitute \nhard massive gneissose rocks, while the southern portion is formed of comparatively soft, thin, \nslate  and  half-schistose  rocks.  The  proposed  improvement  of  treks  is  within  the  Singalila \necotourism zone, in the west district and is within the Kanchendzonga National Park (KNP). The \nsubprojects are outside core areas identified for conservation within the KNP and Biosphere \nreserve and are all within the Manipulation (Tourism) Zone.6 Other subproject sites are not in or \nadjacent to protected areas.  \n                                                 \n1  For Bangladesh, to ensure compliance with the environmental guidelines and requirements of the Government and \nADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002), environmental subproject selection guidelines and an EARP to guide the \nimplementation of future subprojects have been developed. The EARP details the (i) government environmental \nassessment and review procedures, (ii) responsibilities and authorities involved in environmental assessment and \nreview, (iii) compliance with ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines, (iv) staffing requirements and budgets, and (v) \nsubproject environmental selection guidelines. \n2  The Project will be phased; the works in Paharpur Mahavihara site comprises Phase 1 and is the sample \nsubproject. \n3  Including environmental assessment undertaken by the Government for the Nepal airport subproject. \n4  A tributary of the Tinau River. During the rainy season, varieties of fishes found in the khola are the same as those \nin the River. Aquatic vegetation is sparse in the river bed due to the high velocity of the river current. \n5  The Lumbini Gardens were created after the acquisition of land under the 1978 master plan, and the area has \nturned into a rich habitat after tree plantation and creation of wetlands. The Crane and Bird Sanctuary was \nestablished by the International Crane foundation, in association with the World Conservation Union (IUCN) for the \nconservation and restoration of wetland biodiversity. \n6  The KBP, has been demarcated into the core zone, manipulation zone (forestry), manipulation zone (tourism) and \nrestoration zones. The subproject works in the manipulation zone (tourism) are in line with the conservation \n/development plans of the State Forest Department, Government of Sikkim for the management of the National \nPark, and promotion of the Singalila ecotourism zone.  \n ", "   Appendix 12  71 \n \n4.  Bangladesh Subprojects. The Paharpur sample subproject site is a UNESCO World \nHeritage site in the Rahshahi division. Paharpur is located in slightly elevated landform terraces \ncompared with the surrounding flat plains and form a distinct, relatively flood-free physiographic \nunit. The soil is red clay containing an excess of iron and lime but is deficient in siliceous matter. \nThe surrounding land is predominantly agricultural (paddy). There are several streams and \nstanding water bodies connected to the rivers through artificial channels. The site is drained by \na lined drain to the Malancha wetland, which discharges into the Tulsi Ganga River. There is no \nadjacent natural vegetation or protected area. \n \nC.  Environmental Impact Forecasting and Mitigation \n \n  1.  Environmental Impacts \n \n5.  Nepal. The subprojects will have positive environmental impacts particularly in and \naround the cultural and natural heritage site of Lumbini through improved water and solid waste \nmanagement. All works are outside the sacred garden area and the Crane and Bird Sanctuary. \nPotential adverse environmental impacts in the works in Lumbini are largely construction related \nof limited intensity and of short duration, and can be addressed through proven mitigation \nmeasures and adoption of good engineering practices. The Gautam Buddha airport subproject \nwill result in improved environmental conditions with the improvement in drainage conditions \nwithin the site, provision of better sanitation and waste management facilities, and landscaping. \nThe  diversion  of  the Ghaghar  Khola  stream  to  the  periphery  of  the  airport  site  has  been \ndesigned based on 1:100 year return flood flow. No adverse impacts on flooding or on aquatic \nhabitat are envisaged. Potential adverse impacts are largely construction related, which shall be \nof limited intensity to the surrounding communities during the construction period and can be \naddressed through proven mitigation measures and adoption of good engineering practices \nduring construction. The modeling of air and noise7 due to the increased air traffic operations \nindicates that the impacts on the surroundings communities are not significant. \n \n6.  India.  The  subprojects  will  have  positive  environmental  impacts  particularly  in  and \naround  the  cultural  and  natural  heritage  sites  through  the  provision  of  basic  infrastructure \namenities: water supply, basic sanitation facilities, and solid waste management. Works are \noutside protected areas with the exception of the strengthening of the trek in the Singalila \nEcotourism Promotion Zone. However, work in this trek will be limited to existing trek and camp \nsites and will result in positive environmental impacts including reducing erosion, and preventing \ntrekkers  from  going  to  sensitive  areas  outside  the  trails.  Connectivity  improvements  are \nproposed within the vacant existing rights of way. Potential adverse environmental impacts are \nlargely construction related which are of limited intensity and of short duration, and can be \naddressed through proven mitigation measures and adoption of good engineering practices.  \n \n7.  Bangladesh. The subproject will have positive environmental impacts particularly in and \naround the cultural heritage sites through the provision of basic infrastructure amenities: water \nsupply, basic sanitation facilities, site drainage, and solid waste management. Potential adverse \nenvironmental impacts are mostly related to planning, location, and design where failure to \nfollow  environmental  subproject  selection  guidelines  may  adversely  affect  the  site  and  its \n                                                 \n7  For the short-term simulations from the airport, cumulative emissions from all sources in the area are simulated as \nmultiple point area source using SCREEN3. The concentrations were estimated around 400 grid points to obtain \nan optimum description of variations in concentrations over the site in 10-km radius covering 16 directions. The \nincremental concentrations are estimated for the worst case scenario using stability class B. For noise impacts , a \nscreening model Area Equivalent Method, version 7.0 developed by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Office \nof Environment and Energy, USA has been used. \n ", "72  Appendix 12 \n \nsurroundings. There are also construction impacts but these will be of limited intensity and of \nshort duration. These can be addressed through proven mitigation measures and adoption of \ngood engineering practices. \n \n  2.  Mitigation Measures \n \n8.  In  all  subprojects  mitigation  measures  have  been  identified  for  potential  adverse \nimpacts. Measures include proper location, planning, and design of components; control of \nconstruction activity; and proper system maintenance following commissioning. While each \nsubproject with components in cultural and natural heritage sites are designed to have positive \nenvironmental impacts, in view of the fact that the sites are of cultural and natural value, extra \nprecautions  have  been  identified.  All  environmental  assessments  include  environmental \nmanagement  plans  (EMPs),  and  contractor  clauses  as  part  of  the  IEEs.8  Contractors  will \nprepare  a  site  specific  environmental  implementation  plan  (EIP)  on  the  basis  of  the \nenvironmental assessment documents, the EMP, and contractor clauses. The airport expansion \nin Nepal is the subproject which has the largest potential negative environmental impacts. In this \nregard, EMPs have been prepared for the subproject.

A Project Management and Implementation \nUnit  (PMIU)  will  be  established  for  each  subproject.  In  India  and  Bangladesh,  the  PCU \nresponsibilities will be undertaken by the PMIU. The PMIU\u2019s responsibilities include ensuring \nimplementation of IEEs. For Bangladesh it also includes preparing and updating IEEs consistent \nwith the EARP. \n \n10.  Design, Supervision, and Management Consultants (DMS) will be recruited by the PMIU \nto  provide  assistance  in  project  implementation.  The  DMS  consultants  will  include  an \nenvironment  specialist  (DMS-ES).  The  DMS-ES  will  support  environmental  management \nfunctions including updating subproject IEEs in respect to environmental management plans, \nassisting  in  updating  IEEs,  and  assisting  in  monitoring  impacts  and  mitigation  measures \nassociate with subprojects. For Bangladesh, the DMS-ES will also provide technical support to \nthe PMIU including reviewing and updating the EARP and guidelines for specific types of \nsubprojects,  assisting  in  the  preparation  of  reference  for  environmental  assessment,  and \nassisting in the preparation of IEEs.  \n \n11.  Environmental  review  of  subprojects  will  consist  of  screening  by  the  PMIU  and \npreparation  of  updated  and  new  IEEs  by  with  DMS-ES  support.  The  DMS  will  assist  in \nsubproject  preparation  and  implementation.  Review  will  be  conducted  by  environmental \nauthorities in conjunction with a review panel set up by the PMIU. The PMIU working with the \nDMS-ES assist in the steps for updating or preparing the IEE, capacity building and training, \npreparation  of  guidelines  and  procedures,  and  subproject-specific  guidance.  Environmental \nmonitoring as specified in the IEEs will be undertaken by the PMIU through the DMS ES. \nMonitoring reports will be provided to the PCU in Nepal and PMIU in India and Bangladesh, for \napproval and submission on a biannual basis to ADB. \n \n12.  The  DMS-ES  will  be  required  to  include  mitigation  measures  in  designs  where \nappropriate,  and  to  specify  other  measures  in  construction  contracts.  Contractors  will  be \nrequired  by  their  contracts  to  implement  all  specified  mitigation,  monitoring,  and  reporting \nassigned to contractors as presented in subproject IEEs. Draft terms of reference for the ES and \nDMS-ES are in the IEEs and EARP. \n \n D.  Public Consultation and Disclosure \n \n13.  Public consultations (29 sessions) on safeguards were held in each subproject site \nbetween  April  and  August  2008.  This  comprised  a  subproject  briefing  which  provides  an \noverview of potential environmental impacts and proposed mitigation measures. Participants \n ", "74  Appendix 12 \n \n(418)  included  communities  directly  affected  by  the  subprojects,  representatives  of  local \nnongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and representatives of local government agencies. \nIssues raised during public consultations were mostly related to compensation for lost assets, \nand ensuring that there was no loss in access to resources due to the subprojects. All issues \nraised and how these were addressed is documented in the IEEs.  A proposal has been \ndescribed in IEEs for continuing the process of public consultation during construction that \nincludes a mechanism for redress of grievances that arise during construction. All IEEs and \nother relevant documents will be made available at public locations in the towns and will be \ndisclosed to a wider audience via the ADB website.  \n \nE.   Environmental Guidelines and Environmental Assessment and Review \nProcedures (EARP) for Bangladesh \n \n14.  To  ensure  compliance  with  Government  and  ADB  environmental  guidelines  and \nrequirements,  environmental  guidelines  and  EARP  to  guide  the  implementation  of  future \nsubprojects have been developed. Future subprojects will be screened and categorized by the \nPMIU. Appropriate environmental assessment documents will be prepared depending on the \ncategorization and will be reviewed and cleared by ADB for disclosure.  \n \n15.  The full EARP, based on provisions of the Government\u2019s environmental policies and \nlegislative provisions and the Environmental Assessment Guidelines of ADB. The EARP also \ndetails  the  (i)  Government\u2019s  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedures,  (ii) \nresponsibilities  and  authorities  involved  in  environmental  assessment  and  review,  (iii) \ncompliance of the Project with ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines, and (iv) staffing requirements \nand budgets.  \n \nF.  Conclusion \n \n16.  The IEEs show that while cultural and natural heritage subprojects may be sited in \nenvironmentally  sensitive  areas,  the  works  are  designed  to  result  in  improvements  in \nenvironmental  conditions  on-site.  The  environmental  impacts  due  to  the  GBA  are  largely \nconstruction  related\u2014civil  construction  works  associated  with  the  proposed  improvements. \nThere are no impacts on sensitive receptors. The modeling of air and noise impacts due to the \nair traffic do not indicate significant impacts on surrounding communities, and do not require any \nfurther assessments or special mitigation measures. Any adverse environmental impact can be \naddressed  through  proper  location,  planning,  and  design  of  the  subproject;  control  of \nconstruction  activity;  proper  system  maintenance  following  construction;  and  mitigation \nmeasures.  The  proposed  subprojects  have  been  consulted  with  the  stakeholders  and  no \nsignificant  environmental  issues  were  raised.  EMPs  have  been  prepared  and  the  contract \nclauses specified in the EMP will address construction related impacts and effectively minimize \nany  adverse  impacts.  Implementation  arrangements  provide  for  inputs  of  environmental \nspecialists  during  project  implementation  to  effectively  implement  the  EMP.  No  further \nassessments  of  environmental  impacts  are  required  for  the  cultural  and  natural  heritage \nsubprojects in India and Nepal; and the sample subproject in Bangladesh. \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20091026105722+08'00'", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0.5 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20091118102601+08'00'", "Title": ""}, "author_page": " \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year of the Government of Nepal and its agencies ends on 15 July; of \nIndia and its agencies on 31 March, and of Bangladesh and its agencies on 30 \nJune.  \n \n(ii)  In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \n \n  \n \n \nVice-President  X.
