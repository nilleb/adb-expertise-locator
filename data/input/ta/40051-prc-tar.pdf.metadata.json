\nI.  INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  During the country programming review conducted in November 2005, the Government \n(the Government) of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to provide lending support for Gansu Baiyin Urban Development Project (the project). \nProject preparatory technical assistance (TA)1 was included in the ADB assistance program for \n2006 to help the Government prepare the project. ADB fielded a fact-finding mission to the PRC \nfor the TA in June 2006. The mission reached agreement with the Government concerning (i) \nthe impact and outcome of the project; as well as (ii) the outputs, implementation arrangements, \nconsulting  services  needed  and  their  terms  of  reference,  cost  estimates,  and  financing \narrangement for the TA. The design and monitoring framework of the TA is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Baiyin  City  is  a  medium-sized  city  located  in  Gansu  Province,  one  of  the  12  less \ndeveloped western provinces and autonomous regions targeted by the Government for support \nunder the National Strategy for Development of the West (NSDW). The city covers a total land \narea of 21,200 square kilometers (km2) and has a population of 1.74 million (2004). Baiyin City \nhas two urban districts: (i) Baiyin District, which has a land area of 1,373 km2, an urban \npopulation of about 200,000, and where the Baiyin Municipal Government (BMG) is seated; and \n(ii) Pingchuan District, with a land area of 2,106 km2 and an urban population of about 93,000. \nThe  two  urban  districts  are  about  60  kilometers  apart.  They  are  connected  by  a  newly \nconstructed expressway that is well-integrated with the surrounding national and provincial \nexpressway systems, most of which have been built as part of the NSDW. Baiyin City also has \nthree agriculture-based rural counties with irrigated agricultural land, mainly along the Yellow \nRiver, the second-longest river in the PRC. Most of the lands under BMG jurisdiction are state-\nowned, uncultivated, undeveloped, mountainous, and without human settlements.   \n \n3.    Baiyin City was established in the 1950s under the planned economy, mainly to support \ndevelopment and production of Baiyin Nonferrous Metal Corporation, which used to be the \nPRC\u2019s top copper miner, accounting for about one third of national production. Over the past 50 \nyears, Baiyin City has been developed into an important national center for nonferrous metal \nmining, smelting, and initial processing. The legacy of the planned economy also includes the \nbasis for chemical production. Baiyin City is also an important energy center for Gansu Province \nin terms of coal mining and power generation. It has both coal-based thermal power plants and \nhydropower  stations  on  the  Yellow  River.  Rapid  development  of  the  basic  infrastructures, \nsupported  under  the  NSDW  over  the  past  few  years,  has  provided  Baiyin,  which  is \ngeographically remote and relatively isolated, with the basic means to integrate itself with the \nworld market through road, railway, air transport, and telecommunication services. This has \nresulted in steady GDP growth at an average annual rate of 11.4% during the 10th Five Year \nDevelopment Plan period (2001\u20132005) and a reduction in the proportion of the people living \nbelow the government poverty line from 12.4% to 10.8%.    \n \n4.    Along with continued growth of mining production, the carrying capacity of Baiyin City\u2019s \nurban infrastructure has been stretched to its limit, leading to severe environmental and social \ndevelopment problems that affect not only the living standards of the city dwellers but also the \neconomic prospects of Baiyin City. The most acute challenge to future development of Baiyin \nCity is the need to urgently diversify its economic base in view of the diminishing mining \nresources after decades of exploitation. The two main copper mines of Baiyin Nonferrous Metal \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 19 June 2006. \n ", "2   \nCorporation have already been exhausted and abandoned. Mining of the other associated \nminerals  is  also  on  a  declining  trend,  with  closure  projected  in  less  than  two  decades. \nThousands of highly skilled workers are looking for new employment opportunities to survive. \nBaiyin City is classified as one of the 18 major \u201cresource-exhausted\u201d mining cities in the PRC, to \nwhich the newly approved 11th Five Year Development Program has decided to give special \nsupport,  as  a  national  priority,  in  order  to  facilitate  their  economic  diversification  and \ntransformation. The request for ADB lending support for the project is part of the overall support \nprovided by the central government to facilitate the economic transformation of Baiyin City.  \n \n5.  According to the mayor\u2019s report approved by Baiyin City People\u2019s Congress in February \n2006, BMG has set the goal to achieve continued yet inclusive growth through economic \ndiversification and transformation as the foundation to support its long-term and sustainable \neconomic and social development. BMG recognizes that success in economic transformation \nshould be based on local advantages and market forces. In this context, BMG has decided to \nfocus the public interventions on providing an enabling environment to foster and facilitate public \nand  private  investors  as  a  means  of  achieving  economic  transformation,  mainly  through \nextending  and  diversifying  the  existing  production  chains  for  nonferrous  metal  processing, \nchemical production, and agro-processing. Furthermore, in its development plan, BMG has \naccorded high priority to improving provision of district heating service, both by expanding \nservice coverage and improving service efficiency for Baiyin District, where many city dwellers \nmust rely on low efficiency and highly polluting stoves and small boilers to meet their current \nneeds. Based on this strategy, BMG has proposed the project, which will have three major \ncomponents: (i) providing integrated infrastructures, including roads, water supply, wastewater, \nand facilities for power supply, to expand the industrial zone in the southern part of Baiyin \nDistrict as the basis to facilitate economic diversification and transformation; (ii) constructing and \nupgrading urban roads in both Baiyin and Pingchuan districts and improving their interactions \nwith the surrounding national and provincial road networks; and (iii) expanding and improving \nthe district heating services for Baiyin District. \n \n6.    Promoting  inclusive  growth  in  the  interior  provinces  like  Gansu  has  been  a  major \nstrategic thrust of ADB in order to address the regional imbalance in the PRC. In this context, \nADB has provided several loans and technical assistance to support economic development in \nGansu  Province.2 All  these  projects  are  under  smooth  implementation.  At  the  same  time, \nprocessing of the loans is underway for the second Gansu road development project and Gansu \nHeihe hydropower development project, which are included in the assistance program for the \nPRC. The present project will be the first urban development project in Gansu Province financed \nby a multilateral development bank. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The impact of the TA will be to facilitate economic transformation and improve the quality \nof life in Baiyin City. This will be achieved through providing integrated infrastructures for the \nsouthern part of Baiyin District, improving and upgrading the urban road system, and expanding \n                                                 \n2  These include ADB. 2003.
