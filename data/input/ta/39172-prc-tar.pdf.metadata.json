INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the 2006 country programming mission, the Government of the People's Republic \nof China (PRC) requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nfor trade logistics development and capacity building in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region \n(XUAR).  A  fact-finding  mission  visited  Urumqi  during  21\u201323  May  2006  and  reached  an \nunderstanding  with  the  Government  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  cost,  financing \narrangements, terms of reference, and implementation arrangements for the TA.1 The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  recent  rapid  development  of  the  PRC  has  significantly  changed  the  economic \nsituation in coastal regions but left inland regions behind. One of the reasons for the inability of \ninland regions to enjoy the same growth opportunity is lack of adequate transportation and trade \nlogistics  industry  development\u2014both  for  production  and  consumption  activities,  and  for \ndomestic and international trade. Inadequate logistics industry development also inhibited inland \nregions  from  maximizing  economic  benefits  from  regional  trade  facilitation  agreements. \nGeographically, XUAR is an important link to central Asia. It has rich and diverse natural \nresources, and products with low factor costs for labor and land. The region also has sufficient \nenergy  resources  and  production  capacity  to  facilitate  industrial  development.  The  main \nchallenge  that  is  holding  the  region  back  is  its  remote  geographic  location  and  the  vast \ndistances that separate it from major markets. The underdeveloped logistics industry of XUAR, \nboth in terms of physical infrastructure and institutional capabilities, is a major impediment to \ndomestic and regional trade.  \n3.  During the 1950s and 1960s, XUAR had four border posts available for trade with the \nthen Soviet Union, and annual trade volume reached about $13 million in the mid-1960s. \nHowever, border trade came to a total halt in 1967 when the PRC severed the relationship with \nthe then Soviet Union. Horgos and Turugart border posts did not resume operations until 1983. \nIn  September  1990,  the  railway  connecting  Alashankou  and  Druzhba  of  Kazakhstan  was \ncompleted, forming a new Eurasia Continental Bridge. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the \nindependence of the central Asian republics (CARs) in 1992 brought new opportunities for \nXUAR for regional and international trade. Since then, XUAR foreign trade has grown rapidly, \nwith  average  annual  growth  of  28.5%  during  2001\u20132005.  Total  imports  and  exports  were \n$7.9 billion or 24.3% of GDP (exports $5 billion and imports $2.9 billion)\u2014the highest among \nPRC border provinces and regions in 2005. Kazakhstan ranked first (58.2% of total imports and \nexports) among the top five export markets for Xinjiang in 2004, followed by Kyrgyz Republic, \nPakistan,  Azerbaijan,  and  the  Russian  Federation.  These  countries  absorb  about  80%  of \nXinjiang\u2019s total exports. Major export items are light industry products such as processed food, \nfootwear, textiles, and machinery. Major import items are mainly natural resources such as iron \nand steel, scrap metals, nonferrous metals (copper and aluminum), crude oil, and cotton.  \n4.  XUAR has 17 class A border posts (2 of which are airports) and 11 class B border \nposts.2 The top two border posts are Alashankou (total imports of $3.9 billion and total exports \n$2.9 billion in 2005) and Horgos (total imports of $60.1 million and total exports of $757.0 \nmillion), both of which connect to Kazakhstan. The third largest, Turugart, connects to the \nKyrgyz Republic and is becoming significant (total imports of $377 million and exports of $478 \nmillion).  To  facilitate  cross-border  transportation  and  trade,  the  PRC  signed  cross-border \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 2 October 2006. \n2  Class A border posts are major posts approved by the State Council, which meet minimum requirements of transport volume. \nClass B posts are generally small in size and strategically less important. These posts are either not physically located on the \nborder or operate only seasonally.  ", "2   \ntransportation agreements with Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic in 2005, and signed an \ninternational road transportation agreement with the Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan in 1998. \nThe PRC has joined the International Road Transport Union (IRU) and is preparing to access \nthe Transports Internationaux Routiers convention. \n5.  XUAR  has  a  reasonable  transportation  network  of  railways,  roads,  and  airlines. \nHowever,  it  is  not  sufficient  from  a  modern  logistics  operation  point  of  view.  The  high \ntransportation cost that results from long distance transportation makes commodities shipped \nfrom XUAR uncompetitive in other parts of the PRC.3 The transportation network suffers from:  \n(i)  lack of adaptability because of lack of transportation trunk lines, and poor network \nlayout and poor location of transportation hubs; \n(ii)  low construction standard of the road and bridge network, which makes it difficult \nfor heavy and large vehicles; \n(iii)  undeveloped railway system that results in significant delays in rail transport;4 and \n(iv)  inadequate airport facilities. \n6.  The  logistics  industry  can  be  broadly  defined  as  a  combination  of  different service \nproviders, including parcel express companies, freight forwarders, transport lines, and contract \nlogistics companies, as well as local transport operators, terminal facilities, and distribution \ncenters. Similar to most parts of the interior of the PRC, the logistics industry in XUAR is in the \nvery  early  stages  of  development.  In  recent  years,  a  number  of  large  enterprises  in  the \ntransportation and commerce sectors are gradually moving into logistics services. For example, \nthe Xinjiang Department of Crude Oil spun off its material supply company and transformed it to \na logistics company that provides services to the general public. A preliminary survey shows \nfour types of enterprises in XUAR that are engaging in logistics services: \n(i)  Enterprises transformed from state-owned traditional transport and warehousing \nenterprises, such as XUAR Xinshitong Logistics which has been transformed by \nmerging two trucking companies and is now engaging in container and parcel \ndelivery operations. \n(ii)  Newly established sector logistics companies owned by private individuals. Many \nof  these  are  in  their  infancy  but  one  or  two  sizable  ones  provide  transport, \nwarehousing, storage, and procurement services, such as Afanti Logistics which \nhas 28 subsidiaries and 80 transport routes). \n(iii)  Various logistics parks, most of which are wholesale or retail centers that provide \nspace for lease for wholesalers or retailers. Some also provide limited intercity \ntransport services. \n(iv)  Traditional transport and warehousing enterprises, which belong to various sector \ngovernment administrative bodies, still dominate the logistics market. However, \nlack of coordination among administrative bodies causes poor service quality and \nmanagement inefficiency. \n7.  XUAR\u2019s logistics industry faces a number of challenges in both physical and institutional \ninfrastructure,  and  has  become  a  bottleneck  for  XUAR\u2019s  international  trade  and  economic \ndevelopment.  Regarding  physical  infrastructure,  (i)  lack  of  investment  and  upgrade  makes \nXUAR\u2019s railway system unable to meet transportation demand in the short or medium term; and \n(ii) poor management, low level of containerization, and lack of investment in logistics hubs \n                                                 \n3  Lack of rail transport capacity causes coals and other primary commodities to be shipped mostly by road. Coal produced in \nXinjiang can only be shipped no further than Gansu as high transportation costs make it uncompetitive compared with coals from \nShanxi and Shaanxi. \n4  Most are single rails connecting prefectures and counties, and one railway (i.e., Lanxin line) linking Xinjiang to the rest of the \nPRC. ", "    3\nmake the efficiency of road transportation system low. Institutionally, XUAR\u2019s logistics industry \ndemonstrates the following weaknesses: \n(i)  Lack of third party logistics. Although large in number, there is virtually no third \nparty logistics company in operation since most existing logistics companies have \nbeen converted from transport and warehousing enterprises and remained captive. \nThe level of logistics specialization is low and the scope of business is limited\u2014\nonly 15% of logistics companies have operations outside XUAR and less than 2% \noutside the PRC. As a result, the majority of XUAR\u2019s manufacturing enterprises \ncannot find third party logistics services for sourcing raw materials and for shipping \nand distribution of parts and completed products. \n(ii)  Lack  of  logistics  platform  and  poor  technological  and  management \nstandards.  There  are  no  comprehensive  service  and  information  networks. \nLogistics information has not been integrated to benefit the whole industry and \nvirtually  no  logistics  companies  use  a  professional  logistics  management \ninformation system.  \n(iii)  Lack  of  effective  policy  and  administrative  framework.  Many  sectoral \ngovernment  administrations  cover  logistics  issues,  including  railway,  road \ntransportation, airlines, commerce, and customs. The lack of a unified coordinator \nand  administrator  makes  multi-region,  multi-sector,  and  multimode  transport \nlogistics operations difficult. For example, up to 50\u201370% of trucks and railway \nwagons return empty because of lack of information and coordination.  \n(iv)  Lack of well-trained professionals. There is only one university level program for \nhigh-level logistics professionals in XUAR. A certification process and continued \ntraining with the logistics industry is also lacking. \n8.  The Government of the PRC recognized that logistics industry development is key for \nupgrading its industries from \u201cresources intensive\u201d to \u201cresources efficient\u201d industries. Logistics \nindustry development has been included for the first time in the 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u2013\n2010).5 The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the China Association \nof Materials Procurement and Logistics are developing a logistics sector strategy for the 11th \nFive-Year  plan.6  A  joint  committee  on  logistics  development  has  been  set  up,  comprising \n13 government ministries and agencies with a secretary located at NDRC.  \n9.  XUAR local government has also made the development of logistics centers one of its \ntop development priorities. This would involve the construction of logistics infrastructure, as well \nas development of a logistics platform that links logistics providers, customs, and other relevant \nparties  interactively.  During  the  11th  Five-Year  plan  period,  XUAR  will  need  to  enhance \ncooperation  with  CARs  to  ensure  continued  growth  of  trade,  which  is  expected  to  reach \n$18 billion in 2010.  \n10.  ADB has been supporting regional trade facilitation between XUAR and CARs since the \nlate 1990s through a formal Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) process, \nwhere XUAR has been an active participant. The first batch of work focused on customs \ncooperation, where two regional TAs (RETAs) and five loans in various countries are currently \n                                                 \n5  The plan states that the Government will encourage: (i) adoption of modern logistics technologies and promote contracting out \nlogistics operations of enterprises in order to integrate procurement, production, product sales, and recycling operations of \nenterprises; (ii) development of specialized third party logistics; (iii) establishment of a standardized logistics framework; (iv) \ndevelopment of new logistics technologies, including information and communication technology; and (v) integration of basic \ninfrastructure for logistics through constructing a large logistics hub and developing regional logistics centers. \n6  The plan divides the PRC into seven logistics zones; XUAR, together with a number of western provinces and Xian, is included in \nthe northwestern zone. ", "4   \nbeing implemented.7 Logistics development plays a key role for regional trade facilitation, which \nis an important element of ADB\u2019s Regional Cooperation and Integration  (RCI) Strategy. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact is that XUAR becomes an effective national and regional trade center. The \noutcome is that a strategy is adopted and implemented to develop the logistics industry in \nXUAR.  \n12.  XUAR requires better regional integration, reduced transportation costs, and removal of \nother  related  physical  and  institutional  inefficiencies  to  become  an  effective  national  and \nregional trade center. The logistics development strategy will cover issues such as such policy \nreforms, infrastructure development, provision of public financial resources and private sector \nparticipation, and institutional capacity building.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA will prepare (i) a strategy to develop the logistics industry in XUAR; (ii) a master \nplan to implement the strategy; and (iii) a preliminary list of investments to support the strategy. \nThe strategy will focus on policy, institutional, and financial issues regarding logistics industry \ndevelopment. The master plan for logistics industry development will pay particular attention to \nthe public infrastructure and logistics platform, including a single window for customs clearance \nand an over-the-counter dealing system for logistics, as well as capacity building. The list of \ninvestment projects will include public investment and public-private sector partnership projects \nfor the XUAR government to consider. The analytical work of the TA will focus on the following: \n(i)  strategy for developing the regional logistics system with a matching transportation \nnetwork centered around Urumqi; \n(ii)  selection, allocation, and definition of functions of logistics hubs, both for class A \nand class B; \n(iii)  logistics service requirements at border posts\u2014including logistics centers, logistics \nrelated basic infrastructure, and logistics companies\u2014in improving efficiency of the \ncustoms clearance; \n(iv)  containerization  issues,  such  as  demand,  cost  and  benefits,  and  multimode \ntransport of containers; \n(v)  improvement  of  the  road  transportation  network,  including  market  demand, \norganization of the shipping industry, and methods to lower the ratio of return with \nan empty load; \n(vi)  functioning and architecture of the logistics platform, including a general market \ninformation system for demand and supply as well as a specialized system for \nlogistics operators; and interface with customs and financial service providers; \n(vii)  improvement  of  the  efficiency  of  financial  services  for  logistics  operations, \nparticularly focusing on cross-border financial services; \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2002.

Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $600,000 equivalent. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $425,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the \nGovernment of Spain and administered by ADB. The Government will provide the remaining \n$175,000 of local currency costs in kind to cover office accommodation, counterpart staff, \ntransportation, and other related services. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  NDRC\u2019s Department of Regional Economy will be the Executing Agency (EA) to provide \noverall guidance and coordination at the national level. The Xinjiang Development and Reform \nCommission (XDRC) will be the Implementing Agency (IA). A leading group will be set up, \ncomprising senior officials of XDRC, Xinjiang Finance Bureau, Customs Administration and \nQuarantine  Bureau,  Department  of  Foreign  Trade  and  Economic  Cooperation  (DOFEC), \nadministrations of railway, road transportation and airlines, and other relevant agencies, chaired \nby XDRC senior officials, to ensure proper working level coordination as development of trade \nlogistics will involve many agencies. The IA will provide the necessary office space, counterpart \nstaff support, transportation, and other services to the consultants and will arrange meeting \nappointments for the consultants with relevant agencies and organizations. A project office will \nbe set up at the Regional Economic Development Division of XDRC. \n16.  The  TA  will  engage  one  international  and  four  national  consultants  for  a  total  of \n15 person-months (3 person-months each), including a logistics specialist, regional cooperation \neconomist,  transportation  specialist,  public  investment  specialist,  and  logistics  platform \nspecialist. A separate budget will engage additional international and national resource persons \nfor  specific  technical  areas  during  TA  implementation,  as  the  need  arises.
