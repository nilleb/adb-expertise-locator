The Government of the Philippines requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  improve  the  Government\u2019s  monitoring  and  management  of \ngovernment-owned and -controlled corporations (GOCCs). This is a priority undertaking that \nwould help achieve fiscal consolidation, and the TA1 was consequently added to the ADB \nnonlending program of the country strategy and program 2005\u20132007. The Fact-Finding Mission \nwas fielded on 15\u201329 November 2005 and agreement was reached with the Government on the \nTA's purpose, scope, implementation mechanisms, and financing arrangements. The design \nand monitoring framework for the TA is in Appendix 1.     \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Philippine GOCCs were created in one of three ways: by special laws, the corporation \ncode, or by judicial decisions. In general, the mandate of individual GOCCs involves either \nsocially-oriented responsibilities or the provision of basic services, such as transport, water, \npower,  housing,  and  a  stabilized  food  supply.  They  also  engage  in  developmental  and \npioneering activities, including financing. The Department of Finance (DOF) estimates there are \n736 GOCCs. The definition of a GOCC remains very complicated, as defined by legislative fiat, \npresidential decrees, and administrative orders.2 The 736 GOCCs include (i) those created by \njudicial  decision  (e.g.,  local  water  districts),  (ii)  assets  sequestered  during  the  Marcos \nadministration, (iii) assets acquired by government corporations, and (iv) those created via \nlegislative charters. \n3.  The DOF is charged with monitoring the financial performance of all GOCCs.3 Effectively, \nhowever, only 14 corporations are closely monitored, due to their heavy dependence on the \nnational Government for financial support, either (i) directly through equity, subsidy, or advances \nfor debt servicing or (ii) indirectly through national Government guarantee of their obligations.4 \nThese14 GOCCs also account for a substantial portion of the consolidated public sector deficit. \nIn general, the DOF\u2019s monitoring involves tracking of the financial performance of the 14 major \ncorporations and their debt obligations. In addition, the DOF, through its Corporate Affairs \nGroup (CAG), reviews the financial viability of the GOCCs, as well as their project, loan, and \nguarantee proposals. The DOF is expanding its monitoring beyond the 14 major GOCCs to \ninclude other corporations that may pose problems for the national Government. The requests \nfrom the additional GOCCs for direct and indirect national Government support form the basis \nfor their financial performance monitoring. Inasmuch as the 14 major corporations comprise the \nsubstantial  portion  of  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  the  government  corporate  sector,  the \nconsolidated financial performance of these major corporations provides an indication of the \naggregate financial performance of the government corporate sector. Notwithstanding, there \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 24 October 2005. \n2 Such as Republic of the Philippines.1988. Rationalizing the Government Corporate Sector. Administrative Order. \nManila (AO59, series of 1988); and Presidential Decree No. 2029, Series of 1986 on Acquired Assets, among \nothers. \n3  Under Executive Order 127-A3 (1987) and Administrative Order No. 163 (2001). \n4 The 14 monitored GOCCs are Home Guaranty Corporation, Light Rail Transit Authority, Local Water Utilities \nAdministration,  Manila  Waterworks  and  Sewerage  System,  National  Development  Corporation,  National \nElectrification Administration, National Food Authority, National Housing Authority, National Irrigation Authority,  \nNational Power Corporation (by virtue of the Electric Power Industry Reform Act, the Power Sector Assets and \nLiabilities Management Corporation and the National Transmission Corporation are added to the list), Philippine \nEconomic Zone Authority, Philippine National Oil Corporation, Philippine National Railway, and Philippine Ports \nAuthority. \n ", "2   \nremains a need for regular monitoring of government corporations outside of the 14 major \nGOCCs. \n4.  Most GOCCs are incurring significant financial losses. Budgetary support to the total \nGovernment  corporate  sector  (including  government  financial  institutions,  social  security \ninstitutions, and GOCCs providing goods and services to the public) amounted to P80.4 billion \nduring 2000\u20132004. In addition, indirect support, in the form of guarantees on GOCC obligations, \nis also in the billions of pesos. In the past 5 years, there has been a noticeable increase in the \naggregate deficit of the 14 monitored GOCCs, bringing their financial viability into question. \nWhile the 14 monitored GOCCs\u2019 current and capital expenditures fluctuated around 6% of GDP, \nrevenues have fallen from 5% to 4.1% of GDP over 2000\u20132004, increasing the deficit of the \nmonitored GOCCs from 0.6% to 1.8% of GDP over the same period. In 2004, the monitored \nGOCCs\u2019 consolidated deficit was P85.4 billion, a more than fourfold increase from the 2000 \nlevel of P19.2 billion. The 2004 deficit is already about the same size as the potential new \nrevenues collected through the expanded value-added tax law. There are various reasons for \nthe  ballooning  GOCC  deficits,  including  (i)  failure  to  adjust  tariff  rates,  (ii)  large  capital \nrequirements, and (iii) operational and management inefficiencies. The system used by the DOF \nto report on and supervise the GOCCs needs to be reviewed to determine why the deficits \nballooned significantly in the past few years, and why the oversight mechanisms have failed to \nreverse this trend.5 There is also a need to (i) examine the sources of the ballooning GOCC \ndeficits, given the diverse nature of their operations and the services they provide; and (ii) find \nlong-term  solutions  to  improve  their  viability  as  government  corporations,  and  possibly  to \nsuggest privatization programs in some cases. \n5.  The significant financial losses of the GOCCs contribute to the public sector debt. The \ncontribution of the monitored GOCCs\u2019 debt stock to total public sector debt has been high and \nincreasing over the past 5 years, from 30.9% of total public sector debt in 2000 to 32.7% in \n2003, with a slight decline to 29.3% in 2004. The increasing need for deficit financing will \ncontinue to put pressure on the GOCC debt stock to rise, which would in turn add to the already \nhigh levels of total public sector debt. The national Government\u2019s combined outstanding debt \nand estimated off-balance-sheet outstanding liabilities increased by P2.4 trillion 1997 to 2003. \nAccording to a recent study,6 nearly half of the increase is attributable to GOCC activities, both \non- and off-balance sheet. The situation makes fiscal consolidation much more challenging for \nthe Government. ADB\u2019s Philippine country strategy and program for 2005\u20132007 acknowledges \nthese challenges, and makes support for fiscal consolidation a priority. In this context, the \nGovernment has requested ADB assistance to support GOCC reform. \n6.  The TA supports a core element of the Government\u2019s reform agenda. It complements \nanother ADB TA on debt and risk management,7 as well as activities of other development \npartners, including the World Bank, the Australian Agency for International Development, and \nthe  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development.  The  World  Bank  is  providing \ncomplementary support to the DOF for contingent liability management. The United States \nAgency  for  International  Development  is  helping  the  DOF  Privatization  Office  prepare  a \ncomprehensive  inventory  of  GOCC  and  Government  assets,  and  develop  guidelines  for \nidentifying  and  prioritizing  assets  and  GOCCs  for  privatization.  The  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational Development, through the Partnership for Economic Governance Reforms facility, \n                                                 \n5 In the past 5 years, the National Power Corporation has contributed significantly to the overall deficit of GOCCs. \nReforms under the Power Sector Development Program supported by ADB are ongoing to address this issue. \nReforms specific to the National Power Corporation are not covered by this TA.  \n6 ADB. 2005.

ADB has worked \nclosely with development partners in the preparation of the TA, and will continue to do so during \nthe implementation process to ensure an efficient and effective use of resources.  The DOF will \nmanage the ongoing interventions and ensure that development partners will coordinate their \nGOCC strengthening and reform efforts. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The TA\u2019s primary objective is to support the Government\u2019s fiscal consolidation through \nreforms  in  financial  performance  and  monitoring  of  GOCCs,  including  (i)  identifying \nimprovements in the operations of selected GOCCs that will have immediate positive financial \nimpact, thereby improving their financial performance and reducing their financial dependence \non the national Government; (ii) developing performance criteria, targets, and contracts for \nselected GOCCs and identifying financial and nonfinancial incentives/rewards and penalties; \nand  (iii)  strengthening  financial  performance  review  and  monitoring  of  the  GOCCs,  and \nimproving the DOF\u2019s data banking system for the GOCCs.  \n \n8.  Impacts of the TA are macroeconomic stability through fiscal consolidation and more \neffective and efficient delivery of GOCC public services. In the medium term, the TA provides \nthe primary building blocks to enhance good governance in the oversight functions of both the \nnational Government and individual GOCCs. The TA will support a framework to develop (i) \nclarity with respect to the mandate and purpose of the GOCCs; (ii) strong performance-oriented \nmanagement  and  financial  discipline  for  the  GOCCs;  and  (iii)  more  effective  and  efficient \ndelivery of goods and services to the public, as envisioned in their mandates. The detailed \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The key activities of the TA are divided into two main components: \n \n(i)  Component 1: review of financial performance and operations of selected \nGOCCs. Because of the limited resources available, the TA will focus on and \nwork closely with a limited number of GOCCs selected by the DOF;8 this work \nwill serve as a pilot for broader reforms across the GOCCs in the future. Initial \nGOCCs  comprise:  (a)  Bases  Conversion  Development  Authority,  (b)  Home \nInsurance Guaranty Corporation, (c) Philippine National Oil Company,9 (d) Light \nRail Transit Authority, (e) Philippine National Railways, and (f) Small Business \nGuarantee Fund Corporation. The DOF chose these GOCCs on the basis of (a) \nthe magnitude of existing government exposure to these GOCCs, in terms of \nbudgetary support and guarantee exposure; (b) potential government exposure; \nand (c) the increasing involvement of these GOCCs in private sector activities. \nComponent  1  primarily  involves  an  in-depth  review  of  the  organization, \noperations (including financial), policies, and procedures of the selected GOCCs.  \nThe  review  will  identify  gaps  and  weaknesses,  and  provide  specific \n                                                 \n8 The six GOCCs are selected in the interim, subject to confirmation during TA inception; the DOF may substitute \nother GOCCs depending on the outcome of discussions with the respective GOCCs regarding the proposed study. \n9 This includes two subsidiaries: Philippine National Oil Company- Energy Development Corporation and the \nPhilippine National Company-Exploration Corporation. \n ", "4   \nrecommendations  that  will  have  immediate  financial  impact  on  the  GOCCs. \nThese impacts include improvements in their financial position, and reduction, if \nnot total elimination, of their dependence on direct and indirect financial support \nfrom the national Government, without need for legislation, immediate major \nGovernment  policy  shifts,  or  sector  reforms.  The  review  will  include  specific \nrecommendations/actions on operational efficiency, inventory management and \ncontrol, asset and liability management, financial restructuring, and other issues \nthat  have  substantial  impact  on  the  financial  position  of  the  GOCCs.  The \nrecommendations will include identification of performance criteria, targets, and \nthe  corresponding  incentive/reward  and  penalty  mechanisms  to  arrive  at  a \nworkable performance contract between the GOCCs and the oversight agency \n(i.e., the DOF). The review will identify key legislation, major policy shifts, and \nsector  reforms  needed  in  the  medium  term  for  GOCC  development  and \neffectiveness. This includes review of the mandates of the GOCCs, of their roles \nas providers of public goods versus the roles of the national or local government \nor the private sector, and the necessary dispositive actions, as applicable. \n \n(ii)  Component 2: strengthening the GOCC oversight functions of the DOF. \nThis component will review the existing tools and parameters utilized by the DOF \nin (a) monitoring and assessment of the fiscal and financial performance of the \nGOCCs, (b) evaluation of GOCC projects and loan/guarantee proposals, and (c) \nthe data banking system at the Corporate Affairs Group (CAG). The review will \nproduce  recommendations  regarding  (a)  improved  tools  and  parameters, \nincluding the necessary templates to help the CAG strengthen its capacity in \nassessing and monitoring the fiscal and financial performance of the GOCCs; (b) \nevaluation of GOCC project, loan and guarantee proposals, including their fiscal \nimpact; and (c) a more effective data banking system for the GOCCs.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $1,071,430 equivalent.  The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $750,000 equivalent.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s TA funding program.  The Government will finance the balance of the local currency cost, \nequivalent  to  $321,430,  through  in-kind  provision  of  office  accommodation,  transport,  and \ncounterpart staff.  The detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2.   \n  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n11.  The DOF will be the Executing Agency of the TA. An interagency steering committee, \nformed and chaired by the DOF, will oversee TA progress and implement recommendations in \ncoordination with the interagency committees/government bodies concerned. The interagency \nworking group will include the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), the \nDepartment of Budget and Management (DBM), representatives from the Office of the President, \nand representatives from the selected GOCCs and their respective supervising agencies. The \nDOF will provide overall direction for the study and take the lead in maintaining an efficient \ninformation flow with the management of the selected GOCCs, their supervising agencies, \nNEDA, the DBM, and other stakeholders concerned. The DOF will share the findings of the \nreport with the DBM, in support of the Government\u2019s rationalization program under Executive \n ", "  5\nOrder No. 366.10 The DOF will also take the lead in disseminating information to the public on \nthe reform effort, with the support of this TA. Policy dialogue and consultation will be carried out \nwith the selected GOCCs and their respective supervising agencies to ensure ownership and \nparticipation throughout the reform process, and to increase support for the recommended \nreforms. The study will also be shared with other stakeholders (i.e., development partners, the \nprivate sector, and academe) as the DOF deems necessary to ensure wider acceptance of and \nsupport for the recommended reform measures. Training materials will be prepared as required. \n \n12.  The Government will commit to the required counterpart funding through the provision of \noffice space and staff resources.  \n \n13.   A team of international and national consultants will implement the TA activities. A \nproject management and consulting firm will be engaged by ADB to implement Components A \nand B, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  national  consultants,  using  simplified  technical \nproposals under quality and cost-based selection. A total of 64 (28 international and 36 national) \nperson-months of consulting services will be required. The terms of reference (TOR) for the \nconsulting services with the details on the required duration of services are in Appendix 3. The \nconsultants will provide written reports in English on a regular basis: (i) an inception report to \ninclude a comprehensive implementation plan will be submitted within 4 weeks after the start of \nthe TA; (ii) interim report; (ii) progress reports; and (iv) a draft final report and, subsequently, a \nfinal report to be submitted before the end of the TA. Specific timing and content of reports will \nbe discussed with DOF, considering the desired timetable of reports submission for each GOCC.  \nThe reports will be submitted to DOF and ADB (more reporting details specified in Appendix 3). \nADB will procure the required office equipment, computers, and printers in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. The TA will commence in June 2006 and will be implemented \nover 22 months.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n14.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  the  Philippines  for  Government-Owned  and  -Controlled  Corporations \nReform, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \n                                                 \n10 Signed by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo on 4 October 2004, Executive Order 366, or the Rationalization and \nService Delivery Improvement Program, mandates all departments and agencies of the Government, including the \nGOCCs and government financial institutions, to conduct a strategic review of their role and functions, and develop \npossible  organizational  actions  related  to  scaling  down,  phasing  out,  abolishing,  strengthening,  merging, \ndeactivating, consolidating, regularizing, and/or privatizing their functions.
