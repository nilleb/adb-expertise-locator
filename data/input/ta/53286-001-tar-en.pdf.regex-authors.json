INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  strengthen  development \nresearch partnerships on the themes of innovation, technology, and regional cooperation by \ncollaborating  with  policy  research  institutions  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific.  It  will  promote  new \nknowledge generated from these research works by organizing technical workshops, policy \ndialogues, and networking among government and research institutions. \n \n2.  The TA is included in the 2019 annual work program for the Economic Research and \nRegional Cooperation Department (ERCD) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to (i) undertake \nand  disseminate  policy  research  and  knowledge  generation  on  development  and  regional \neconomic  cooperation;  and  (ii)  collaborate  and  network  with  international  organizations, \ngovernment  agencies,  and  research  institutes.1 It  will  also  support  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030 \nOperational Plan for Priority 7: Fostering Regional Cooperation and Integration, 2019\u20132024 by \ncontributing to the improvement of policy formulation and project design on regional public goods.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Innovation and technological change are rapidly transforming the economic landscape \nacross Asia and the Pacific. Advancement of digital computing technologies and innovations such \nas mobile communications, artificial intelligence, big data analysis, and robotics are changing the \nway entities produce, transact, and interact in the markets. Business processes have also \nbenefitted from a productivity boost through the emergence of the platform economy \u2500 digital \nstructures that enable economic and social activities \u2500 and e-commerce.3 Technologies have \nallowed many economic activities to transcend borders at much lower costs. \n \n4.  Along with digitalization, increasing economic transactions, and interaction of people \ncomes  increased  complexity  in  economic  activities,  cross-border  interdependence,  and \nexternalities.4 The  share  of  cross-border  services  and  financial  transactions  using  digital \nplatforms has expanded, possibly adding complexity to the policy and regulatory environment. \nWhile new technologies such as digital identity, artificial intelligence, and block chain technologies \nhave the potential to promote efficiency and transparency in such economic activities and \nmarkets, the digital economy that transcends borders is generating new risks and vulnerabilities, \nwhich  may  simultaneously  affect  multiple  countries.  These  risks  can  be  in  the  forms  of \ncyberattacks and transnational crimes resulting from the increased digital transactions, the lack \nof protection for the rights of the digital or online workforce, or financial contagion from increased \ncross-border financial transactions. The persistence of a wide digital divide within and across \ncountries continues to pose a threat to inclusive growth. \n \n5.  Generating policy-relevant knowledge on the implications of innovation and technological \nchange on regional cooperation is essential, especially in the following areas: (i) developing the \nconceptual framework to understand and model the economic impact of ongoing innovation and \ntechnological changes in Asia and the Pacific; (ii) assessing the economic potential and policy \n \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 23 December 2019.  \n2  ADB. 2019.

Manila (pp. 122\u2013177). \n ", "2 \nchallenges for adopting a particular technology or group of technologies; and (iii) identifying the \npolicy implications and recommendations, both at national and regional levels. \n \n6.  There is limited research that evaluates the impacts and implications of innovation and \ntechnology on the regional economy because of several reasons. Technology-related research \nnecessitates  technical  expertise  and  exploration  of  new  data  sources  and  research \nmethodologies, and these are often limited in developing member country (DMC) research \ninstitutions. Regional and cross-country research also requires resources, networks, coordination, \nand trust, while the supply can be limited because of externalities and the public-good nature of \nthe knowledge. \n \n7.  This TA will respond to the need for building knowledge and strengthening knowledge \nsharing on the impacts and implications of innovation and technology on regional economies and \npolicy implications for regional cooperation. It will build on ERCD\u2019s growing portfolio of broad and \nspecific technology-focused research on the regional economic agenda, such as e-commerce, \nfinancial  technology  and  sustainable  finance,  digital  trade,  technology  and  human  capital \ndevelopment, and the movement of people.5 The TA promotes innovative research that uses \nnovel techniques and data sources, such as big data that can elucidate the effects, challenges, \nand opportunities of existing and emerging technologies. Cross-sectional issues on economic, \nsocial, and environmental aspects of technological innovation could also be part of the research \nareas. \n \n8.  This  TA  will  encourage  participation  and  collaboration  among  regional  research \ninstitutions,  including  members  of  the  ADB\u2013Asian  Think  Tank  Network,  to  tap  advanced \nknowledge and expertise by forging strong international alliances. The TA team will conduct \nresearch focusing on technology in the regional context, which also contributes to improving the \nresearch capacity of the think tanks in ADB\u2019s DMCs. A past ADB project has demonstrated that \nproviding a platform for knowledge generation and sharing can inspire and challenge younger \nthink tanks to improve their research and institutional capacities.6 An ongoing TA implemented by \nERCD engaged with these think tanks, resulting in research work in the areas of aging and labor \nmobility and trade and global value chains, with impact on policy-making in some of the DMCs.7 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: policy formulation and project design in \nADB\u2019s DMCs enhanced, and inclusiveness of regional cooperation and integration projects \nstrengthened.8 The TA will have the following outcome: knowledge on innovation, technology, \nand regional cooperation improved and knowledge alliance enhanced.9 \n \n \n5  ADB. 2018.

Output  1:  Study  proposals  from  developing  member  country  development \nresearchers submitted and collaborative research on three development topics conducted. \nThe TA will implement three joint research projects on the topics of innovation, technology, and \nregional cooperation, in collaboration with development research institutions. One inception \nworkshop and two technical workshops will be conducted per theme to assess research progress. \nDraft research papers will be presented to a group of experts. Call for papers will be issued prior \nto the policy dialogue workshop in partnership with regional research institutions. Presentations \nin other regional forums, such as the Asia\u2013Pacific Economic Cooperation, the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations, and all of ADB\u2019s flagship regional cooperation and integration programs, \nwill be sought to expand the reach of the research findings.  \n \n11.  Output 2: Development researchers from developing member country think tanks \nimproved research capacities and deepened knowledge on the themes. Workshops and \nforums will be conducted for each topic to provide a platform for knowledge exchange, in-depth \ndiscussions, and discourse on innovative findings and/or ideas and policy solutions. Participants \nwill be encouraged to discuss ongoing or proposed research works relevant to the themes. They \nare expected to benefit from the comments of like-minded experts. \n \n12.  Output 3: Policy papers and reports published and disseminated. Policy briefs, \nincluding policy recommendations, will be generated from the research papers, and will be \ndisseminated electronically to as wide a regional audience as possible and through collaboration \nwith other ADB projects. The results of the studies will also be shared and discussed with ADB\u2019s \nregional departments. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB will administer the TA. The Regional Cooperation and Integration Division (ERCI) of \nERCD will be responsible for supervising and managing consultants, procuring goods, organizing \nworkshops, providing staff as appropriate to act as resource persons in workshops, and achieving \nthe desired outputs. Collaboration with ADB\u2019s regional departments will be sought as much as \npossible for alignment of research priorities and dissemination of studies. \n \n15.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in the table. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  December 2019\u2013November 2021 \nExecuting agency  Asian Development Bank (ADB), Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration Division \nConsultantsa  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nIndividual: individual  International expertise  $181,000 \nselection  (14 person-months) \nIndividual: individual  National expertise (77  $192,000 \nselection  person-months) \n ", "4 \nAspects  Arrangements \nProcurementb  To be procured by ADB \nRequest for quotations  4 contracts  $6,000 \nDisbursement  The technical assistance resources will be disbursed following \nADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). \na  ADB will consider lump-sum payments, output-based contracts, and framework contracts for individual consulting \nservices. \nb  Procurement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n16. Consulting services. ADB will engage the consultants following the ADB Procurement\nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions\nand/or staff instructions.10 ADB will commission the international consultants to conduct research\non chosen topics. ERCI will work with the international consultants to produce research papers.\nNational consultants will include project analysts, publications and/or website developers, and an\nevent organizer. ADB will engage international experts, which may include ADB staff, as resource\npersons to present or facilitate discussion at seminars and other events. Engaging individual\nconsultants is deemed more beneficial to ADB since the desired sector and/or country expertise\nand qualifications of individual consultants are varied. It will be difficult to find a firm that\nspecializes in the range of topics and countries that the TA will cover.\n17. An ERCI staff team comprising two international staff members (one acting as the project\nleader and the other as alternate project leader), one national officer, one operations coordinator,\nand one operations assistant will oversee and manage TA implementation.\n18. Knowledge  partnerships.  Although  not  envisioned  for  this  TA,  should  it  become\nnecessary to enter into knowledge partnership agreements of an intellectual and/or advisory\nnature  with  international  organizations,  academic  institutions,  and/or  think  tanks,  any  such\npartnership will follow the Staff Instruction on Business Processes for Knowledge Partnerships\nunder Technical Assistance Operations.11 The partnership agreements will clearly delineate roles\nand disbursements.\n19. ADB\u2019s procurement. The purchase of software and/or statistical databases will follow the\nADB Procurement Policy and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended\nfrom time to time). Where applicable, the TA team will coordinate with ADB\u2019s Procurement,\nPortfolio and Financial Management Department and Office of the General Counsel before\npurchasing datasets and signing data use agreements with DMC statistical agencies and third-\nparty database providers. Disbursements under this TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).\n20. Social media and websites. The TA team will maintain the website of an existing relevant\nproject (footnote 7).12 Before project closing, it will explore other sources of financing for website\nmaintenance if there is strong demand for the website\u2019s continued existence. In the absence of\nsuch demand, the website will be automatically deactivated 3 months after the TA completion\ndate.\n10 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n11 ADB. 2017.
