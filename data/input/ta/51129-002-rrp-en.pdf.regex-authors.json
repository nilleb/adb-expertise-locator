THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased loan to Armenia for the Human Development Enhancement Program.1 \n \n2.  The  proposed  program  is  closely  aligned  with  the  medium-term  objectives  of  the \nGovernment of Armenia of improving the quality and coverage of services in the education and \nhealth sectors. It supports key reforms that will help create a conducive legal and regulatory \nenvironment for expanding investments in human capital development, envisaged under the \nArmenia Development Strategy, 2014\u20132025 and the government program, 2019\u20132023.2 The \nprogram will lead to Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance in human capital development \nrequested by the government. The program, with completed prior actions and the adoption of a \npost-program partnership framework (P3F), will be followed by technical assistance (TA) and \ninvestment projects, including results-based loan programs and TA.3 The proposed support is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.4 \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Economic context.5 With per capita gross national income of $4,230 (Atlas method) in \n2018, Armenia was classified an upper middle-income country (UMIC) in July 2018. After high \neconomic growth, averaging more than 11% during 2000\u20132008, Armenia entered a low-growth, \nlow-investment phase during 2010\u20132016. Growth rates rose to 7.5% in 2017 and 5.2% in 2018, \nbut growth is highly dependent on the external environment because of the narrow economic \nbase. Armenia\u2019s poverty rate is higher than that of other UMICs, with about 50% of the population \nbelow the UMIC poverty line of $5.50 in 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita per day.6 \nIn addition to the relatively high poverty rate, income inequality has been increasing.7  \n \n \n1  The proposed policy-based loan was originally planned to follow a programmatic approach. As part of the discussions \non the country operations business plan, 2020\u20132022, the government has indicated that its preference for policy-\nbased loans for service delivery reforms in education and health in 2019, and for investment projects and results-\nbased loans in 2020\u20132022, as articulated in the government\u2019s medium-term expenditure framework, 2020\u20132022. The \nsubsequent reforms will be supported through the post-program partnership framework (P3F). \n2  Government of Armenia. 2014. Armenia Development Strategy for 2014\u20132025.

The program addresses mainly operational area 1 (addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities \nthrough increasing emphasis on human development, improving education and training, and achieving better health \nfor all). It also contributes to operational area 2 (accelerating progress in gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment \nby rolling out the gender mainstreaming action plan in both sectors); operational area 4 (making cities more livable \nby banning smoking in public places and improving road safety through child seat restraint decree); and operational \narea 6 (strengthening governance and institutional capacity by supporting the development of the governance and \nimplementation arrangements for the National Institute of Education). \n5  Sector Assessment (Summary): Education and Health (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2); \nand International Monetary Fund Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6  Based on the international poverty thresholds, 1.8% (2016) of the population live on less than $1.90/day (2011 PPP), \nand 14.1% (2016) of the population on less than $3.20/day (2011 PPP). \n7  Statistical Committee of the Republic of Armenia (Armstat) and World Bank. 2018. Social Snapshot and Poverty in \nArmenia: Statistical and Analytical Report. Yerevan. \n ", "2 \n4.  With current fertility rates of 1.6 children per woman and life expectancy of 75 at birth,8 \nArmenia is in a late stage of demographic transition and has started facing rapid decline of the \nworking age population. From 1990 to 2019, the share of children under the age of 18 shrank \nfrom 37% to 25% of the total population. Labor productivity in Armenia has been lagging other \nUMICs, and its growth has remained well below 2008 levels.9 In addition to having a direct impact \non economic activity, productivity improvements are important as the country\u2019s population ages.10 \nThus, to sustain economic development in the future, the country needs to ensure that its children \nand  youth  are  able  to  develop  their  full  human  capital  potential,  and  investing  in  human \ndevelopment has to be a priority of the government\u2019s development program. \n \n5.  Human capital development. Children and youth in Armenia do not attain their full \nhuman capital potential because many lack access to quality education and health services. This \nis exacerbated by unhealthy practices and low social sector government expenditure. Children \nborn in Armenia today will only be 57% as productive when they grow up compared to their full \npotential if offered a complete suite of education and health services.11 Armenia\u2019s education and \nhealth services need to improve in coverage and quality. This will help to underpin greater \nparticipation in an economy increasingly based on services and technology, and contribute to \nhigher growth potential. \n \n6.  Education. Public expenditure on education was about 2.2% of gross domestic product \n(GDP) in 2017, lower than the 5% recommended by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation \nand Development. Overall, gross school enrollment in Armenia is high, at 85.7% in 2017, but \ngross enrollment for children below age 5 remains low. As of 2017, the gross enrollment ratio for \nchildren below 5 years of age was only 30.9%, with most in urban centers. Early child education \nhas a significant cognitive effect on children and impact on their subsequent learning at school.12 \nThe government aims to increase preschool education enrollment to 70% among children above \n3 years of age by 2023. Lack of a legal framework and regulatory conditions has hindered the \ndevelopment of alternative solutions for preschool education, including limited private sector \nprovision. To remedy this and promote an enabling environment, the government has endorsed \na law on preschool education for consideration by the National Assembly. \n \n7.  The higher education subsector suffers from compromised quality of higher education \nproducts and services because of the absence of robust governance, rigorous monitoring, and \ncontrol mechanisms.13  Low public confidence and the high cost of higher education have led to \nmodest enrollment rates\u2014at 56%\u2014with 62% female enrollment and 52% male enrollment. \nSystemic inefficiency has led to a shortage of key equipment, underqualified and poorly motivated \nfaculty, and a limited number of facilities. Students from richer households are more likely to \nattend tertiary education than those from poorer households. Government scholarships are limited \n \n8  World Bank.

Therefore, the \ngovernment has revised the higher education law to bring it into line with international best \npractice on accreditation and quality assurance of higher education institutions. \n \n8.  Despite improved access, student achievement outcomes in international tests point to \nthe relatively poor quality of the education system. Armenia performed below average in the tests, \nand results in mathematics and science have been stagnant from 2003 to 2015.14 The World Bank \nis providing assistance to modernize the school curricula, especially for science, technology, \nengineering, and mathematics. However, the ability of teachers to implement the new curricula \nremains a constraint to improved quality of education. No standards are in place for the teaching \nprofession, creating challenges for pre- and in-service training, attestation, and performance \nmonitoring.  An  inadequate  education  management  information  system  (EMIS)  undermines \neffective monitoring of school performance and evidence-based policy and solution making. \n \n9.  Health.  Health  financing  in  Armenia  remains  a  major  hurdle.  Government  health \nexpenditure in Armenia is 1.3% of GDP in 2017, well below average of 3.5% in emerging \nmarkets.15 In 2017, 84% of current health expenditure came from out-of-pocket payments\u2014the \nhighest in the world.16  While the health sector accounts for about 10% of GDP, the public sector \naccounts for only a fraction of health expenditures. The vast majority comes from private spending, \ndriven by the absence of effective health insurance. This leaves poor households vulnerable to \nunexpected health care expenditures, elevates overall spending in the sector, and reduces health \noutcomes. \n \n10.  The  government  earmarks  budgetary  resources  to  target  the  socially  vulnerable \npopulation and the socially important diseases.17 The budget pays for primary health care \nservices, and emergency services for all Armenian citizens, with a co-payment schedule for some \nservices and exemptions of the poor and vulnerable from significant co-payments, which are \ntypically 50% of the cost. Curative care is provided free only for the poor, vulnerable, and special \ncategories, including children under the age of 7.18 The remaining 50% of the population, including \nchildren aged 7\u201318, lack effective coverage for curative care (footnote 17). \n \n11.  While physical access to facilities is not a major issue, the 2018 Armenia Health System \nPerformance Assessment underlines quality of care as one of the main challenges of the health \nsystem.19 For instance, the rate of postnatal complications related to anemia remained very high, \nat 66 per 1,000 deliveries in 2017 compared with three in 1990; the proportion of mothers \nreceiving early prenatal care was 69% (compared with the target of 90%); and the early detection \nrates of cancer have been stagnant since 2008, at about 56%.20 Although some progress has \nbeen made in modernizing facilities and equipment, increasing hospital occupancy rates, and \n \n14 D.

Avdalbekyan. \n ", "4 \nshortening the average length of stay, the country requires a clear strategy to improve the quality \nof health services. Public providers show low responsiveness to patient needs. Medical care \nstandards and quality assurance systems are limited in functionality and not widely adopted. \nSystems for accreditation and continuous medical education of health care professionals, as well \nas the licensing of facilities, are inadequate or nonexistent. Despite an operational e-health \nsystem since 2013, the central e-health system and the electronic medical records of hospitals or \nprimary health care institutions have not been integrated. As such, data collected cannot be used \nto make evidence-based decisions. Manual data entry also makes the current e-health system \nprone to inaccuracies, leading to inefficiency and lack of transparency in health sector operations. \n \n12.  Unhealthy practices. One of the major obstacles to human capital development in \nArmenia is the absence of safety regulations and enforcement. Tobacco use is among the leading \nbehavioral risk factors in Armenia for premature mortality. Almost half of the male population \nsmoke, and about 20% have been smoking since they were 15.21 For young people at the peak \nof their productive lives, motor vehicle injuries are among the leading causes of death and injury.22 \nSeat belt enforcement is still limited (70% of drivers wear seatbelts), while child car seat laws are \nyet to be implemented. Risky behavior such as smoking and reckless driving deplete productive \nhuman capital.23 \n \n13.  Gender inequality. Armenia has a gender inequality index of 0.262, ranking 55th out of \n166 countries. Women\u2019s gross national income per capita is almost half of that of men.24 The \nhealth and education sectors struggle with gender stereotypes. Gender parity exists in school \nenrollment rates, yet female labor participation remains significantly lower than that of males.25 \nWomen are concentrated in \u201ctraditionally female\u201d areas of study, which limit their access to higher \npaid, often male-dominated jobs (footnote 25). Higher education and state institutions lack \nfacilities for lactating mothers, while reproductive health services, including infertility treatment, \nare  difficult  to  access  in  rural  areas.  Limited  early  childhood  education  hinders  women\u2019s \nparticipation  in  the  workforce.  Households  headed  by  women  are  also  poorer  and  more \nsusceptible to fall into poverty because of out-of-pocket expenses (footnote 7). \n \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n14.  The proposed policy-based loan, based on 11 critical and completed policy actions, helps \nthe government lay critical foundations to improve the provision of services by (i) improving \naccess to education and health services, (ii) addressing structural impediments affecting the \nquality of services, (iii) improving financing and sector management, and (iv) exercising its \nstewardship function to promote healthy practices. ADB\u2019s support is timely, fills a fiscal gap, and \nensures  the  legal  and  institutional  reforms  needed  to  give  the  government  confidence  in \nenhancing investments in education and health. Without ADB\u2019s quick and timely support for these \nreforms, significant expansion of expenditure in the social sectors would be unsustainable. \n \n \n21 I. Postolovska et al. 2017.

ADB has been engaged through the TA since 2015 in the education \nsector and since 2017 in the health sector.26 This timely program leverages the right reforms to \ncreate a structured avenue for further physical investments to help Armenia strengthen its human \ncapital  development  outcomes. ADB  also  provided  a  platform  for  development  partners  to \nconsolidate its activities towards the government reform agenda. This program would enable \ngreater public expenditure in the social sectors and leverage support and investments from other \ndevelopment  partners and  the  private  sector. ADB\u2019s  specific  contributions  include  systemic \nteacher development, education financing and skills gap analyses, and assessment of digital \neducation, actuarial analysis of coverage expansion of the basic benefit package, quality of care \nand digital health assessments and strategies, and support to the development of education and \nhealth strategies. \n \n1.  Improving Access to Services \n \n16.  Improving access to education. To ensure equal access to education, the government \nendorsed a preschool law to the National Assembly, which will provide a legal framework to \nincrease the coverage of preschool education by adopting alternative preschool models including \ncommunity-based services. \n \n17.  Foundations for gender-inclusive education and health services established. The \ngovernment  has  demonstrated  commitment  to  gender  mainstreaming  since  2010  when  it \napproved the first gender policy concept, which aimed to ensure equal rights and opportunities \nfor men and women. In 2019, to ensure continuity and commitment, it initiated the second round \nof reforms by developing a gender mainstreaming action plan for the education and health sectors \nfor 2019\u20132023. The action plan (i) ensures equal representation of boys and girls in all levels of \neducation, (ii) ensures inclusive curriculum and training programs that promote equal participation \nof female and male students, (iii) increases women\u2019s involvement in science, (iv) increases the \ngender  sensitivity  of  health  service  providers  through  training,  (v)  improves  the  quality  of \nreproductive health services in rural areas, (vi) protects the sexual reproductive rights of women \nby increasing the provision of infertility treatment, (vii) mandates feeding rooms for nursing \nmothers at higher education and state institutions, and (viii) informs socially disadvantaged \nwomen about the provision of free inpatient care services. The plan will also help ensure more \nopportunities, particularly for girls, to enroll in vocational and professional education programs in \ntechnical fields that lead to higher salaries. This will help reduce the higher unemployment rate \namong females and give opportunities to women to work in higher-salary positions. \n \n2.  Enhancing the Quality of Services  \n \n18.  Improving the quality of education. To improve the quality of education (including \npreschool), new standards are being set for teachers, including teacher performance monitoring \nand evaluation mechanisms. The proposed preschool law (para. 16) provides a legal framework \nfor these efforts. The Ministry of Education, Science, Culture and Sport (MOESCS) circulated a \ndraft  law  on  higher  education  and  science  for  government  review,  which  streamlines  the \ncompetencies of state bodies and the academy, improves human resources management, sets \nnew licensing and accreditation requirements for higher education institutions, and articulates \nsupervision mechanisms to monitor service quality.  \n \n \n26 ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance for Education and Skills for Employment in Central and West Asia. Manila; and \nADB. 2017. Technical Assistance to Armenia for the Social Sectors Reform Program. Manila. \n ", "6 \n19.  Improving the quality of health care services. The Ministry of Health (MOH) has been \npursuing improvements in the quality of care through guidelines and circulars. In 2017\u20132019, \nmore than 310 guidelines and protocols were written and localized for Armenia, of which 73 were \napproved by MOH orders. In 2018, the minister issued guidelines to all hospitals that outline \nmeasures to prevent hospital-acquired infections.27 To introduce continuing medical education, \nthe minister issued an order that outlines the regulation for acquiring credits for continuing medical \neducation and an order regulating trainers.28 The Law on Medical Care and Services to the \nPopulation, amended and submitted to the National Assembly, provides the legal foundation for \nall these milestones. The law incorporates provisions that improve quality of care through disease \nmanagement tools prioritizing women\u2019s health, accreditation of facilities, and licensing. \n \n3.  Increasing Financing and Improving Management \n \n20.  Operationalizing  governance  and  capacity  improvement  of  education  sector \nagencies. In June 2019, the government issued a decree for dissolving the outdated National \nInstitute of Education (NIE), and started to transform the Sustainable School Food Foundation \n(SSFF) into the National Center for Education Development and Innovation (NCEDI). NCEDI will \nbecome a leading change agent and innovator in school education and manage teachers\u2019 in-\nservice training. The SSFF Board of Trustees decision expanded the goal of the new foundation \nto develop and upgrade the education sector by ensuring quality education for learners. To \nimprove education management and resource planning, the MOESCS issued a decree on \ndeveloping a sector-wide EMIS system and a detailed plan to strengthen sector performance \nanalysis. \n21.  Strengthening the use of data to generate evidence for health sector performance \nmanagement. The Minister of Health signed an order establishing the protocol for data entry in \nthe e-health system to improve its quality.29 The MOH mandated computer literacy training of \nphysicians and nurses, focusing on the use of the e-health system.30 The MOH has also been \npilot testing an e-prescription system that fills medical prescriptions electronically. Once rolled out \nnationally, this will facilitate accurate and error-free transmission of prescriptions from physicians \nto pharmacies.31 To provide the legal foundation for these milestones, the Law on Medical Care \nand Services to the Population has been amended to incorporate (i) sex-disaggregated e-health \npolicies, (ii) data privacy and access rules, and (iii) data interoperability. Data privacy and access \nrules imply that patient\u2019s data are protected to ensure that no unauthorized individual can access \nthe data. Data interoperability allows for data exchange among different providers. The most \nsignificant impact of this provision would be to allow future policy decisions based on robust data, \nwhich is currently unavailable. \n \n22.  Increased financing of the education and health sectors based on the government-\napproved  Medium-Term  Expenditure  Framework,  2020\u20132022  programmed.  To  sustain \nadequate financing of education, the government increased allocation in the Medium-Term \nExpenditure Framework (MTEF), 2020\u20132022 for the education sector by 14.5% in 2020.

This reflects the government\u2019s intention to increase \nfinancing and gradually attain the levels recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). \n \n4.  Promoting Healthy Practices Through Government Policies \n \n23.  Public health policies that reduce risks and mortality for children and youth drafted \nand approved. The best way to avoid future loss of productive human capital is to make it difficult \nto engage in risky behavior through regulations and public campaigns. The government issued a \ngovernment decree in April 2019 stipulating that children under 7 years old must be in a car seat \nand that children above 7 years of age must wear a seatbelt or use a child restraint system; and \nthe MOH approved a program on child injury prevention. The MOH drafted comprehensive \ntobacco control legislation as an update to the existing Anti-Tobacco law, 2005. The Law on the \nReduction and Prevention of Health Damage Resulting from Using Tobacco Products and \nTobacco Substitutes, submitted by the government to the National Assembly, includes provisions \nsuch as placing pictorial warnings on not less than 50% of the area of the pack, prohibiting sales \nto children under 18 years of age, restricting advertising, prohibiting smoking in public places, and \nintroducing  smoking  cessation  mechanisms.  These  laws  would  significantly  decrease  the \nincidence of tobacco smoking-related diseases (including lung cancer and chronic obstructive \npulmonary disease), and car seat restraints would reduce fatalities in motor vehicle crashes. \nAlthough these are intended to improve productive human capital, they have other benefits \nincluding a lower disease burden and a reduction in health expenditure related to trauma and \nemergency cases or possible chronic illnesses such as lung cancer.  \n \n24.  Post-program partnership framework. The P3F provides a common understanding and \nproposes possible actions to be supported by ADB and other development partners following this \npolicy-based lending (Appendix 4) that will sustain the reforms initiated under the program. Under \nthe P3F, the MOESCS will prepare operational plans for expanding the preschool network, rolling \nout the gender mainstreaming action plan, working toward the approval of the Comprehensive \nEducation Sector-wide Strategy and Implementation Plan,34 rolling out the implementation plan \nfor transforming the NIE and professional standards for teachers nationwide, and implementing a \nsector-wide EMIS. The MOESCS will also complete its shift to program budgeting and alignment \nwith the MTEF. For its P3F, the MOH will reflect relevant indicators on quality of care in the \ngovernment budget paper, pilot test clinical decision-making tools in vulnerable districts,35 work \ntoward developing an e-health strategy, and roll out an e-prescription system if the pilot test is \nsuccessful. The MOH will also undertake various activities toward the approval of the Law on \nDecreasing and Prevention of Negative Impacts of the Use of Tobacco Products; and prepare the \n5-year tobacco control strategy and implementation plan. To ensure budget predictability, the \ngovernment commits to keep the deviation of the actual budget from planned increases in the \nMTEF, 2020\u20132022 within 1% in 2020, 2021, and 2022; and for the MOESCS and the MOH to \nsustain budget execution rates at more than 95% for these years. The MOESCS will also develop \nformulas for determining the funding levels for different activities, while the MOH will work toward \n \n32 Government of Armenia.

Major lessons learned from ADB\u2019s policy-based lending programs include \nsetting  realistic  policy  actions,  program  ownership,  conducting  in-depth  consultations,  and \nengaging implementing agencies\u2019 technical staff (footnote 36). International lessons in education \nreforms stress the importance of a holistic approach to bring about policy reforms that include \naccess, quality, and institutional and governance improvements.37 Lessons learned in pursuing \nhealth  reforms  in  Armenia  were  incorporated,  including  ensuring  that  changes  in  provider \npayment mechanisms are supported by better information flow and quality assurance to achieve \nbest results, ensuring that the introduction of health financing policy changes does not negatively \naffect quality.38  \n \n26.  Development partner coordination. In education, the European Union is supporting \nArmenia to improve the quality of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education \nat all levels of the education system. The World Bank is financing the reconstruction of up to \n14 high  schools  as  well  as  the  development  of  curricula.  The  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr \nInternationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) supports the government\u2019s efforts to improve technical and \nvocational education and training and link it with the requirements of the labor market. In health, \nthe World Bank\u2019s program supports prevention, early detection, and management of selected \nnoncommunicable diseases at the primary health care level and construction of selected hospitals \nin Armenia.39 The Global Fund focuses on reducing the burden and transmission of HIV and \ntuberculosis and the WHO provides technical assistance and expertise for developing important \nstrategic documents in the health sector. ADB has led consultations on the program. In education, \nADB co-chaired regular coordination meetings with development partners and civil society, with \nMOESCS leadership. In health, it participated in joint mission with the World Bank, WHO, and \nGlobal Fund.  \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n \n27.  The program is closely aligned with the reform agenda of the government\u2019s 5-year \nprogram.40 The ultimate goal of the program is to  develop Armenia\u2019s human potential by providing \nquality education that meets international standards,  and ensuring affordability of and access to \nhealth services. The reform will help increase children and youth benefitting from improved \neducation and health services.41 The program aims to improve human capital development by (i) \nimproving access to education and health services, (ii) enhancing the quality of services, (iii) \nincreasing financing and improving management, and (iv) promoting healthy lifestyles through \ngovernment policies. \n \n \n36 ADB. 2018.

The  2019  state  budget  envisages  a  budget  deficit  of  2.2%  of  GDP  in  2019.  The \ngovernment\u2019s 2019 annual borrowing plan, developed in accordance with the macroeconomic \nframework and indicators of the 2019 state budget in line with the targets and benchmark \nindicators of the Medium-Term Government Debt Management Strategy, 2019\u20132021,42 estimated \nthe gross financing needs at $891 million in 2019. The deficit of the 2019 state budget was \nestimated at $319 million, 35.7% of which is planned to be financed from domestic sources and \n64.3%  from  external  sources.  The  loan  size  is  justified,  considering  the  government\u2019s \ndevelopment expenditure and financing needs in 2019. \n \n29.  The government has requested a regular loan of \u20ac9,100,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the program. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period \nof 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offer \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n30.  The Ministry of Finance will be the executing agency for the program. The MOESCS and \nthe MOH are the implementing agencies. The program implementation period is from June 2017 \nthrough October 2019. The loan closing date is 31 December 2019. The proceeds of the policy-\nbased loan will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as \namended from time to time). 43 \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n31.  Governance. Armenia\u2019s public financial management has steadily improved over time in \nbudget  credibility,  comprehensiveness  and  transparency,  program-based  budgeting  and \nexecution, and revenue administration.44 The government\u2019s Anticorruption Council is responsible \nfor  setting  anticorruption  policies,  leading  investigations,  and  imposing  remedies.  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment, the Ministry of Finance, the MOESCS, and the MOH. \n \n32.  Poverty and social. The program addresses key poverty and social issues by improving \nthe human capital of children and youth. The major benefit of the program is improved productivity \nbecause of better quality of and access to health care and preschool and tertiary education. While \nall Armenian citizens will potentially benefit from these reforms, the primary beneficiary group will \nbe children and youth, who will benefit via improved access to better education and health \nservices because of the policy reforms. \n \n33.  Gender. The program is classified effective gender mainstreaming. The policy matrix \nreflects the adoption and implementation of a gender action plan for education and health. The \nprogram will help train teachers to encourage female participation in more technical fields, which \nare generally male-dominated but have higher salaries.45 Increased preschool coverage is also \n \n42 Government of Armenia. 2018.
