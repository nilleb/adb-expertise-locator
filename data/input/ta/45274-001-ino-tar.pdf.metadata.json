INTRODUCTION \n1.  This capacity development technical assistance (TA) will support the Ministry of Energy \nand Mineral Resources (MEMR), the provincial government of Nusa Tenggara Timur (NTT), and \nthe local government of Sumba Island to design and implement energy access programs based \non  renewable  energy  sources.  The  TA  addresses  key  priorities  elaborated  in  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) energy sector assessment, strategy and road map for Indonesia \n(ASR), namely: improving access to reliable sources of power in rural areas, and expanded use \nof  renewable  energy.  It  will  directly  contribute  to  the  two  pillars  of  the  Indonesia  country \npartnership strategy, 2012\u20132014: (i) inclusive growth, and (ii) environmental sustainability with \nclimate change mitigation and adaptation.1 The TA is included in the ADB\u2019s country operations \nbusiness  plan,  2012\u20132014. 2  The  scope,  expected  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  and \nimplementation arrangements were discussed with the government and finalized during a TA \nfact-finding mission in July 2012. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3 \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Indonesia lags behind its neighbors in terms of access to energy for its citizens. In 2011, \nan estimated 68% of the total population in Indonesia has access to electricity or modern forms \nof energy.4 The electrification ratio is considerably less in rural areas\u2014as low as 30% in some \nprovinces. Further, about 46% of the population living in rural and remote parts, including small \nislands, have no access to modern cooking fuels, and are dependent on traditional forest-based \nbiomass. Lack of access to electricity and modern forms of energy, and the resultant reliance on \ntraditional biomass, has corresponding negative impacts on forests, indoor air quality, and \nprospects for improved livelihoods.  \n3.  With the support of international development partners, the government experienced \nearly success in implementing its electrification programs. Starting with an initial electrification \nbaseline of 2% in the mid-1970s, the government was able to sustain an electrification rate of 1 \nmillion households per year through the 1990s. The 1997 financial crisis led to a drastic slow \ndown  in  rural  electrification  programs.  Since  2000,  the  government  has  pursued  rural \nelectrification initiatives through MEMR5 and the State Electricity Company (PLN), with the \nsupport of local governments and nongovernment organizations. However, the relatively high \ncost  of  providing  energy  access  in  rural  areas,  inadequate  institutional  capacity,  lack  of \ncoordination among implementing agencies, and absence of the private sector have stymied \nprogress and current annual rate of electrification is lower that what is required to assure \nuniversal access to energy in the medium-term. This is particularly the case for small islands \nand remote areas in Eastern Indonesia.  \n \n4.  Development partners and nongovernment organizations have been involved in modest \nscaling up energy access in Indonesia with mixed success. The United Nations Environment \nProgramme  launched  its  solar  lighting  partnership  program  in  2010,6 and  several  vendors \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2012.

Manila. \n5  Notable among the government\u2019s small-scale renewable energy programs is the domestic biogas program. The \nprogram\u2014focused on small-scale livestock owners in areas where wood fuel is becoming scarce\u2014was initiated in \n2009 in four provinces in Java and has been extended to two more provinces. The program will have successfully \ninstalled over 8,000 domestic biogas digesters by the end of 2012. The government has indicated that it is \ninterested in scaling up this effort to install 26,000 digesters under the Program\u2019s second phase during 2012\u20132015. \n6  United Nations Environment Programme. http://www.unep.org/ \n ", "2   \noffering small wind, solar lanterns, and improved cook stoves have set up operations in the \ncountry. A micro-hydropower program financed by the German government has been active in \nthe country for over a decade and has supported several installations and the establishment of \nturbine manufacturing and maintenance industry.  \n \n5.  Several developments have coalesced to improve the prospects for expanding rural \nenergy access in Indonesia. Recognizing the strong link between improved energy access and \nprospects for poverty alleviation and inclusive economic growth, and as a member of the Group \nof Twenty (G20) nations, Indonesia has reinstated expanding access to energy as a national \npriority. The provision of energy access is addressed by a range of policies such as Law \n30/2009 that makes access to energy a right, Law 30/2007 that obligates the government to \nprovide energy access in remote areas and in post-disaster contexts, and Presidential Decree \n5/2006 that mandates that renewable resources should provide 17% of the total national energy \nmix by 2020. Further, in terms of pricing, a ministerial regulation (MEMR 31/2009) directs PLN \nto pay a higher tariff to purchase power from small producers (up to 10 megawatts). The \ngovernment has set a target of attaining an electrification ratio of 90% by 2020. MEMR has also \nestablished a directorate general for new and renewable energy that oversees biogas, and \nsmall-scale renewable energy generation. \n \n6.  In terms of resource endowment, Indonesia has an abundance of renewable energy \nsources including solar, hydropower, and geothermal. The government\u2019s renewed commitment \nto enhancing rural energy access also dovetails with significant cost reductions in renewable \nenergy technologies, and improvements in financing and institutional models that have helped \nmake renewable energy for off-grid and on-grid application more sustainable. In contrast, fossil \nfuels have become more expensive, are linked to both local air pollution and global greenhouse \ngas emissions, and are no longer attractive options to provide electricity to rural and remote \nareas. Encouraging the adoption of economically sustainable renewable energy alternatives \nsimultaneously addresses energy poverty and climate change. Depending on the renewable \nenergy  resources  that  are  developed,  positive  social  impacts  could  include  welfare \nimprovements  for  women  and  children,  increased  local  enterprises  and  diversification  of \nlivelihoods, and a lowering of indoor air pollution-related illnesses (from the use of traditional \nbiomass). \n7.  In 2011, as part of a regional initiative, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) undertook a \nscoping study to (i) assess the potential for increasing energy access using off-grid renewable \nenergy,  (ii)  identify  innovative  technologies,  (iii)  examine  different  institutional  models,  and \n(iv) outline possible financing approaches.7 The scoping analysis concluded that MEMR, owing \nto its mandate to oversee all energy-related programs in the country, is ideally positioned to \ndirect and coordinate implementation of the energy access programs. It also highlighted the \nneed to create a more conducive and enabling environment for local and regional banks and \nindependent power producers (IPPs) to bring in additional resources and expertise. Finally, the \nanalysis noted that local governments in the focus areas have gained considerable financing \nand  implementation  responsibility  as  part  of  the  government\u2019s  decentralization  efforts,  and \nwould need to be integrated into the implementation of specific programs. In March 2012, \nMEMR requested ADB to provide TA support for promoting energy access through increased \nuse of renewable energy, with a special focus on remote areas and small islands in eastern \nIndonesia. \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance for Empowering the Poor through Increasing Access to Energy. Manila. The \nregional  TA  was  financed  by  the  Asian  Clean  Energy Fund  and  covered  Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  Cambodia, \nIndonesia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Nepal, Pakistan, and the Philippines.    \n ", "3 \n8.  Based on discussions with MEMR, the area chosen for the TA is the NTT region of \nIndonesia  (with  a  focus  on  Sumba  Island).  A  study  conducted  by  the  Netherlands \nnongovernment  organization  Humanist  Institute  for  Development  Cooperation  (Hivos) \ndemonstrates that, through proper utilization of indigenous resources, it is technically feasible to \nmeet more than 90% of the energy demands of Sumba through renewable energy.8 The TA will \nbuild on early resource surveys and economic analyses conducted in Sumba.9 The provincial \ngovernment of NTT and the district governments of Sumba (comprised of four districts) are \npursuing energy access programs jointly with MEMR and the regional office of PLN, and have \ndesignated Sumba an \u2015iconic island\u2016 that will have universal energy access from renewable \nenergy sources. In addition, a few small-scale IPPs are active in the region. Commercial banks \nthat operate on the island have also indicated an interest in participating in energy access \nprograms.  \n \n9.  A focus on Sumba and NTT allows the TA to build on prior work and provides an ideal \nimplementation context with several interested stakeholders. MEMR has constituted a task force \nto scale up renewable energy generation in Sumba and all stakeholders are task force members. \nThe TA will align its scope and work plan with that of the task force and support its objectives.  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be increased access to energy in the NTT region of Indonesia. The \noutcome will be improved capacity within MEMR, PLN, the regional government of NTT, and the \nlocal  governments  of  Sumba  to  design  and  manage  rural  energy  access  programs  using \nrenewable energy resources.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will build on the preliminary work that has been undertaken in Sumba and \nsupport the future activities of the task force set up by the stakeholders. The key outputs of the \nTA will include (i) developing a detailed energy access plan for Sumba, (ii) identifying and \npreparing at least three priority investment projects to be developed by small IPPs, and (iii) \nstrengthening the implementation of ongoing and planned energy access programs financed by \nthe government. \n12.  The TA will undertake the following activities in the targeted areas:  \n(i)  Strengthen the capacity of the local governments for planning energy access \nprograms  in  off-grid  areas  including  (a)  surveys  of  resource  availability; \n(b) willingness to pay for energy; (c) assessment of renewable energy technology, \nand appraisal and financing of renewable energy projects; and (d) community \nengagement and private sector participation.  \n(ii)  Support the development of at least three mini-grid projects involving small IPPs, \nincluding facilitating their access to finance from commercial banks.  \n(iii)  Review  ongoing  government  programs  for  energy  access,  and  pilot  test \nimprovements relating to cost recovery and financing, installation and operation \nand maintenance of renewable energy hardware, community engagement, and \nprivate sector participation.  \n                                                \n8  Hivos. 2011.

The TA is estimated to cost $1,100,000, of which $1,000,000 equivalent will be financed \non a grant basis by the Multi-Donor Clean Energy Fund10 under the Clean Energy Financing \nPartnership Facility, and administered by ADB. The government will provide counterpart support \nin the form of staff time, office space, staff travel costs, and other in-kind contributions. The cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  MEMR will be the executing agency (EA). The provincial government of NTT (based in \nKupang) will be the implementing agency. Making the provincial government the implementing \nagency  (IA)  allows  for  better  coordination  among  the  four  district  governments  that  have \njurisdiction over Sumba. Within ADB, the TA will be managed by the Southeast Asia Energy \nDivision  through  the  Indonesia  Resident  Mission  with  support  from  the  regional  TA  for \nEmpowering the Poor through Increasing Access to Energy.11 To support the Sumba iconic \nisland program, MEMR has constituted a task force comprising officials from headquarters, the \nregional office in Kupang (NTT), the provincial government of NTT, the district governments of \nSumba, and PLN\u2019s national and regional offices. The task force has set up a multi-year work \nplan with associated activities. ADB will align its TA work plan with that of the task force. This \ntask  force  will  also  have  representation  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  the  National \nDevelopment Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) and will serve as the steering committee and \noversee TA design and work plan implementation, and review and endorse TA outputs.  \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 2 years, commencing in January 2013 and ending in \nDecember  2014.  About  131  person-months  of  consulting  services  (18  person-months  of \ninternational  consultants  and  113  person-months  of  national  consultants)  will  be  engaged \nthrough a firm. The international consulting firm, together with the national consultants, will be \nhired through quality- and cost-based selection (quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10) on the basis of a full \ntechnical proposal. The international consultants will include the following: (i) renewable energy \nspecialist\u2014team leader, (ii) distribution engineer, (iii) micro hydro specialist, (iv) small wind \nenergy  specialist,  (v) renewable  energy  finance  specialist,  (vii)  procurement  specialist,  and \n(viii) capacity development specialist. National consultants will have expertise that complements \nthe international experts and support them in their work. The national team will also include (i) a \ncarbon  finance  specialist,  (ii)  community  development  facilitators  to  help  with  project \nimplementation and ongoing community engagement, and (iii) an office manager. The terms of \nreference for consultants are outlined in Appendix 3. Additional TA resources may become \navailable after inception, which would allow an expansion of the scope of the consultant\u2019s \ncontract to carry out additional surveys and investigations on the introduction of other renewable \nenergy technologies.12 Therefore, in addition to the renewable energy technologies identified \nabove, the selected firm should be able to demonstrate expertise in other areas such as solar \nphotovoltaics, biogas, and liquid biofuels for small-scale power generation, all of which may be \nconsidered for inclusion in an expanded terms of reference in the future. All TA disbursements \nwill be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \n                                                \n10  Contributors: the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. \n11 ADB. 2010.
