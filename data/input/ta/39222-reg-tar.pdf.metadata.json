INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Central and South Asia faces a new era as peace returned to Afghanistan after years of \nconflict. Massive international relief and rehabilitation assistance is taking place in Afghanistan. \nThese  developments  have  opened  up  new  opportunities  for  the  region  to  achieve  sustained \neconomic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  Key  to  achieving  these  goals  is  developing  efficient \ntransport corridors that connect landlocked Central Asia republics to seaports in the Arabian Sea \nand the Persian Gulf via Afghanistan.  \n \n2.  Afghanistan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Iran as an observer1 participated in the \nFirst Ministerial Conference on Transport and Trade in Central and South Asia hosted by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and held in Manila on 31 July\u20131 August 2003. Those countries agreed to \nestablish the Central and South Asia Transport and Trade Forum (CSATTF) as the instrument to \nfacilitate  transport  connectivity  and  trade  in  the  subregion.  ADB  immediately  responded  by \nproviding regional technical assistance (TA) for Subregional Economic Cooperation in South and \nCentral Asia (SECSCA) for $600,000, approved in December 2003, which focused mainly on \nCSATTF.  The  Secretariat  was  established  in  South  Asia  Department  (SARD)  and  CSATTF \nmember  countries  are  Afghanistan,  Pakistan,  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan,  Uzbekistan,  and  Iran.2 \nPhase I will be completed in December 2005. The concept paper for SECSCA Phase II was \napproved by the ADB Management on 31 October 2005.3 The design and monitoring framework is \nin Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The major challenges to transport and trade facilitation in the subregion identified at the \nbeginning of CSATTF were (i) poor or inadequate infrastructure facilities, (ii) limited coordination of \ninfrastructure  investments,  (iii)  restrictive  trade  policies,  (iv)  limited  regulatory  frameworks,  (v) \ndifferent  customs  laws  and  procedures,  (vi)  underdeveloped  transport  logistics  services,  (vii) \nsecurity concerns regarding drugs and human trafficking, and (viii) capacity constraints in both \npublic and private sectors.  \n \n4.  During  the  last  2  years,  CSATTF  has  addressed  these  challenges  through  a  corridor \ndevelopment plan, focusing on two main transport corridors4 and covering the five major areas: (i) \ninfrastructure improvement (road and border infrastructure); (ii) customs cooperation; (iii) transit \narrangements; (iv) anti-trafficking activities; and (v) consultations, knowledge sharing, and capacity \ndevelopment. In conjunction with CSATTF, ADB has actively provided financial assistance totaling \n$726.7 million to Afghanistan and Pakistan for improving road infrastructure and border facilities, \nand  to  Tajikistan  for  modernizing  customs  procedures;  and  supporting  trade  and  transport \nfacilitation through technical assistance totaling $1.15 million. ADB has actively pursued close \noperational  coordination  with  its  development  partners  that  support  the  above-mentioned  five \n                                                 \n1 Turkmenistan was invited but did not send representatives to the conference. However, it sent representatives to two \nworking group meetings. \n2 SECSCA has not financed any activities in Iran. Iran financed its participation in meetings under phase I. This \narrangement will continue under phase II. During the last 2 years, Iran has undertaken considerable amount of work by \nusing its own resources for infrastructure and customs improvement. As Iran is a member of the World Bank, the World \nBank informally approached Iran to finance activities in Iran in conjunction with CSATTF. \n3 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 14 November 2005. \n4 Two major transport corridors are (i) the North\u2013South Corridor (connecting Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan \nthrough Afghanistan to the ports of Karachi, Gwadar, and Port Qasim in Pakistan) totaling about 2,800 kilometers (km); \nand (ii) the East\u2013West Corridor (connecting the same countries, through Afghanistan to the ports of Bandar-e-Abbas \nand Chabahar in Iran) totaling about 2,900 km. The North\u2013South Corridor comprises (i) Tajikistan\u2013Afghanistan\u2013\nPakistan  section  (about  2,200  km),  (ii)  Uzbekistan\u2013Afghanistan\u2013Pakistan  section  (about  2,900  km),  and \n(iii) Turkmenistan\u2013Afghanistan\u2013Pakistan section (about 3,200 km). The East\u2013West Corridor consists of (i) Tajikistan\u2013\nAfghanistan\u2013Iran  section  (about  2,800  km),  (ii)  Uzbekistan\u2013Afghanistan\u2013Iran  section  (about  3,200  km),  and  \n(iii) Turkmenistan\u2013Afghanistan\u2013Iran section (about 2,600 km). ", "2   \nareas.5 CSATTF has also maintained close operational coordination with the regional programs \nconducted  by  ADB\u2019s  East  and  Central  Asia  Department  (ECRD)  and  Economic  Cooperation \nOrganization (ECO). This coordination has aimed at avoiding overlapping initiatives, achieving \nsynergistic benefits wherever possible, and supporting together trade and transport facilitation.  \n \n5.  Road Infrastructure. Road links along the two CSATTF corridors have been improved \nsteadily during the last 2 years. Before CSATTF, about 40% of the total length of each transport \ncorridor was considered in good condition with adequate maintenance, while the remaining 60% \nwas identified as in need of rehabilitation or upgrading. Presently, about 40% of the total length of \neach corridor (about 1,100 kilometers [km]) has been improved or is being improved with external \nassistance,  leaving  about  20%  for  rehabilitation  and  upgrading.  ADB  has  contributed  to  the \nimprovement of a total of about 940 km along the North\u2013South Corridor (about 34% of the total \nlength) and about 740 km (about 26%) along the East\u2013West Corridor.6 \n \n6.  Traffic has built up significantly along the CSATTF corridors in Afghanistan, while there has \nbeen a steady buildup in other CSATTF countries.7 Despite the current road transport constraints, \nregional and transit trade moving along both corridors has been significant, especially through \nTorkham/Landi Kotal, Spin Boldak/Chamman, and Islam Qala/Dogharun border crossings. An ADB-\nfinanced master plan study for Afghanistan8 estimates that the traffic level along the CSATTF \ncorridors would more than double by 2015. Future traffic developments will require further road \nimprovement or widening of the regional highways in Afghanistan and along the two transport \ncorridors in its neighboring countries.9 To systematically identify necessary transport infrastructure \nand  service  improvement  for  effective  consultations  with  CSATTF  members  and  development \npartners, a diagnostic assessment of all available transport modes along the transport corridors and \na strategy and action plan are considered necessary. \n \n7.  Border Infrastructure. Transport and trade along the CSATTF corridors are presently \nconstrained at the transport nodes where transshipment often takes place and where infrastructure \nfacilities, mostly border facilities, need further development or improvement. Under CSATTF, the \neight major border crossings have been identified along the two corridors.10   \n                                                 \n5  The  CSATTF  partners  include  the  Economic  Cooperation  Organization  (ECO),  European  Union  (EU),  Islamic \nDevelopment Bank, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), United Nations Development \nProgramme (UNDP), United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), World Bank, and bilateral partners such as \nthe governments of Germany, India, Japan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and United States.  \n6 The roads are being improved under Loan 2019\u2013PAK (ADB. 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the \nBoard of Directors on a Proposed Loan to Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Balochistan Road Development Sector \nProject. Manila [approved on 20 November, for $185 million]); Loans 2103/2104\u2013PAK (ADB. 2004. Report and \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the \nNWP Road Development Sector and Subregional Connectivity. Manila. [approved on 18 November, for $301 million]); \nand Loan 1997-AFG (ADB. 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a \nProposed Loan to Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Reconstruction \nProject. Manila [approved on 28 November, for $150 million]), together with Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) \nin the amount of $20 million (JFPR-9037) for transport, education and health sectors. JFPR also provided $15 million \n(JFPR-9024) for the improvement of the Kandahar\u2013Spin Boldak road section, together with $15 million from Kuwait \nFund, and social sector. EU, Islamic Development Bank, World Bank, and bilateral partners such as the governments \nof India, Iran, Japan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and United States have provided funding to improve part of the \nregional highways in Afghanistan located along the CSATTF corridors. \n7 The traffic between Kabul and Torkham in Afghanistan, for example, has reached about 5,000\u20137,800 average annual \ndaily traffic (AADT) this year. Traffic of 3,200\u20136,200 AADT and 2,100\u20135,100 AADT has been recorded between \nAndkhuouy and Kabul, and between Herat and Kabul, respectively. \n8  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for Preparing the Master Plan for Road \nNetwork Improvement Project. Manila. (TA 4371-AFG, approved on 6 August 2004, for $2 million).  \n9  In the case of Pakistan, for instance, a road link between Hyderabad and Peshawar (about 146 km) is being upgraded \nto four lanes. \n10 These are (i) Hairatan\u2013Ayritom/Termez (Afghanistan\u2013Uzbekistan border), (ii) Shir Khan Bandar\u2013Nizhniy Pyandzh \n(Afghanistan\u2013Tajikistan border), (iii) Torkham\u2013Torkham/Landi Kotal (Afghanistan\u2013Pakistan border), (iv) Waish/Spin \nBoldak\u2013Chamman  (Afghanistan\u2013Pakistan  border),  (v)  Zaranj\u2013Milak  (Afghanistan\u2013Iran  border),  (vi)  Islam  Qala\u2013", "  3\n \n8.  ADB is currently assisting Pakistan in developing and upgrading border facilities adjacent to \nAfghanistan at Chamman, Ghlam Khan, and Torkham.11 At the Second Ministerial Conference \n(March 2005), CSATTF countries agreed to adopt a coordinated development program for border \ncrossing facilities and operations. The physical infrastructure and procedural aspects of all CSATTF \nborder points and the major inland clearing depots (ICDs) in Afghanistan have been reviewed.12 \nThe findings will serve as a basis in preparing a coordinated CSATTF border facility development \nstrategy and action program, reflecting activities by development partners. \n \n9.  Customs  Procedures.  The  border  and  clearance  procedures  in  Afghanistan  and  its \nneighboring countries do not yet conform to international best practice. Although developments are \nleading in that direction, there is still a degree of inconsistency in relation to the requirements at \ndifferent  border  crossings  and  ICDs.  CSATTF  has  identified  the  four  major  areas  to  address \ncustoms-related  issues:  (i)  simplification  and  harmonization  of  customs  procedures  and \ndocumentation, (ii) information and communications technology-based data sharing for customs \noperations, (iii) application of modern customs techniques, and (iv) capacity building of local and \nnational customs administration officials. The framework of the customs cooperation plan was \nendorsed  at  the  Second  Ministerial  Conference,  and  the development  of  a  CSATTF  customs \nstrategy and action plan reflecting activities by development partners13 is expected. \n \n10.  Transit Systems. In addition to physical improvement of the transport corridors, improving \nthe transit systems is crucial to the goals of CSATTF. CSATTF has adopted two approaches: (i) \naccession to the relevant international conventions, and (ii) development of efficient corridor transit \nsystems.  Of  nine  conventions  identified,14  five  CSATTF  member  countries  have  completed \naccession to three: (i) Convention on Road Traffic, (ii) Convention on Road Signs and Signals, and \n(iii)  Customs  Convention  on  International  Transport  of  Goods  under  Cover  of  the  Transports \nInternationaux  Routiers  (TIR)  Carnets.15  The  remaining  conventions  have  different  levels  of \naccession. To support the development of efficient transit systems, CSATTF has identified the need \nfor (i) modernizing existing bilateral agreements, (ii) developing a transit strategy based on bilateral \nor  multilateral  agreements,  (iii)  developing  a  single  transit  document  based  on  a  single \nadministrative document, (iv) developing TIR in the region, and (v) examining the potential for other \ntransit systems. The development of a CSATTF transit strategy and action plan covering these \nareas is needed to make further progress in improving transit systems. \n \n11.  Anti-Trafficking  and  Money  Laundering.  Drug  and  human  trafficking,  and  money \nlaundering are major challenges to the subregion. CSATTF encourages its member countries to \n                                                                                                                                                                \nDogharun (Afghanistan\u2013Iran border), (vii) Torghundi\u2013Gushgy (Afghanistan\u2013Turkmenistan border), and (viii) Aqina\u2013\nImamnazar (Afghanistan\u2013Turkmenistan border). \n11 ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to Islamic Republic of Pakistan for Cross Border Development (TA 4116 PAK for \n$500,000), attached to Loan 2019\u2013PAK (footnote 6) reviews cross border development at Chaman. Loans 2103/2104\u2013\nPAK (footnote 6) include the improvement of the border facilities at Ghlam Khan and Torkham. The World Bank has \nassisted Afghanistan in reconstructing the Hairatan border and, in cooperation with EU, the Torkham border under the \nEmergency Customs Modernization and Trade Facilitation Project, approved in 2003, for $31 million. The border \nfacilities at Islam Qala, Shir Khan Bandar, Torghundi, and Zaranj in Afghanistan have also been upgraded with \nassistance from the governments of Germany, Iran, and United States. \n12 SECSCA financed this in conjunction with ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for \nCross-Border Trade and Transport Facilitation. Manila (TA 4536-AFG, approved on 23 December, for $550,000).  \n13 World Bank\u2019s Emergency Customs Modernization and Trade Facilitation Project in Afghanistan, and Trade and \nTransport  Facilitation  Project  in  Pakistan  (approved  in  2001,  for  $3.0  million)  have  also  supported  customs \nmodernization. CAREC\u2019s trade program is also included. \n14 These are (i) Convention on Road Traffic, (ii) Convention on Road Signs and Signals, (iii) International Convention on \nthe Harmonization of Frontier Control of Goods, (iv) Convention on the Contract for the International Carrying of Goods \nby Road, (v) Conventions Pertaining to Perishable Goods, (vi) Customs Convention on the International Transport of \nGoods under Cover of the TIR Carnets, (vii) Customs Convention on the Temporary Importation of Commercial Road \nVehicles, (viii) Customs Convention on Containers, and (ix) Revised Kyoto Customs Convention.  \n15 Afghanistan is going to sign the first two conventions and Pakistan is in the process of ratifying the third convention. ", "4   \ncooperate more closely at the borders to prevent such trafficking. The United Nations Office on \nDrugs and Crime (UNODC) and the German Government have supported CSATTF by sharing their \nknowledge and the results of their activities in the subregion. The significance of drug and human \ntrafficking, and money laundering in the subregion requires further knowledge sharing and the \ndevelopment of a strategy and coordination plan16 among CSATTF countries and development \npartners. \n \n12.  Consultations, Knowledge Sharing, and Capacity Development. ADB has encouraged \namong CSATTF member countries active consultations, including meetings not only among high-\nlevel government officials (ministerial level) but also among technocrats and professionals, and \ndevelopment partners. Meetings also serve as forums for sharing knowledge related to trade and \ntransport facilitation. So far, two ministerial conferences and two technical working group meetings \nhave been held.  \n \n13.  Trade and Investment. The last 2 years have shown a growing need to review the current \ntrade and investment environment that influence the demand for trade and transport along the \ncorridors. An appropriate strategy and action plan needs to be developed. \n  \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The intended impact of the TA is expanded economic activities in the subregion. The \nenvisaged outcome of the TA is institutionalization among CSATTF member countries of systematic \napproaches to improve transport and trade facilitation in the subregion. Outputs that will support the \nimpact and outcome are strategy and action programs on (i) transport infrastructure and services \n(including  brief  prefeasibility  studies  on  priority  projects  or  programs,  incorporating  public  and \nprivate\u2013partnership  [PPP]  opportunities);  (ii)  customs  and  transit  systems;  (iii)  anti-trafficking, \nmoney laundering, and HIV/AIDS; and (iv) trade and investment. The strategy and action programs \ninclude (i) assessment of economic activities and their implications for transport and trade in the \nregion; (ii) a diagnostic review of (a) transport infrastructure and services along the two CSATTF \ncorridors, (b) customs and transit systems (including border and customs-related facilities), (c) drug \nand human trafficking, money laundering, and HIV/AIDS, and (d) trade and investment; and (iii) \ncapacity development programs on trade and transport facilitation in support of the strategy and \naction plans.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The approach and methodology will be drawn from, and build on, the operational experience \nof ADB\u2019s regional cooperation programs and development partners, as well as lessons learned in \nthe field. The TA will provide CSATTF members (including both public and private sectors) and \nADB\u2019s development partners with joint consultation opportunities to address transport and trade \nfacilitation issues in the subregion through working group meetings and seminars. It will also \nprovide opportunities for sharing knowledge of international best practices in trade and transport \nfacilitation, and capacity development.  \n \n16.  Consultants will conduct site visits and interviews, and gather data from both the public and \nprivate sectors. The consultants also will (i) assess existing and future economic activities that \ngenerate and influence demand for trade and transport in the subregion, and (ii) conduct diagnostic \nreviews of (a) transport infrastructure and services along the two CSATTF corridors (including PPP \nopportunities), (b) customs and transit systems (including border and customs-related facilities), (c) \ndrug and human trafficking, money laundering, and HIV/AIDS; and (d) trade and investment. They \n                                                 \n16   HIV/AIDS will also be included. ", "  5\nwill also collaborate with personnel involved in ongoing programs of all development partners. On \nthe basis of these activities, the consultants will prepare strategy and action plan reports on (i) \ntransport  infrastructure  and  services;  (ii)  customs  and  transit  systems;  (iii)  drug  and  human \ntrafficking, money laundering, and HIV/AIDS; and (iv) trade and investment. The main report will \nsummarize the findings of these reports and include an assessment of economic activities and their \nimpact on trade and traffic, and capacity development programs. Draft reports will be reviewed by \nADB, working group members, and CSATTF member countries. The final strategy and action plans \nwill  be  presented  at  the  Third  Ministerial  Conference  for  its  endorsement  of  implementation. \nInternational experts will also provide advisory services during the TA implementation. Apart from \nthe sector coverage envisaged, the TA will review additional cooperation opportunities that will also \nenhance regional cooperation in the subregion. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $950,000 and will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. Details of the cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 2.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements   \n18.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will work with CSATTF member countries \nand ADB\u2019s development partners.17 Under the TA, five international sector experts will be engaged \nfor a total of 17 person-months. In addition, a senior TA advisor (domestic consultant) and a senior \nproject analyst (domestic consultant) will be engaged for 24 person-months, respectively, to support \nTA  implementation.  The  consultants  will  be  stationed  in  the  Secretariat  at  the  Operations \nCoordination Division, SARD. Their outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. ADB will select \nthe consultants, on an individual basis, in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for selecting domestic consultants.18 \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months starting in January 2006 and will be completed \nin December 2007.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n20.  The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $950,000 on a grant basis for \nSubregional Economic Cooperation in South and Central Asia (Phase II), and hereby reports this \naction to the Board.  \n                                                 \n17 SARD\u2019s Transport and Communications Division (SATC) and Governance, Finance, and Trade Division (SAGF) will \nimplement their respective sector components of the TA, together with Regional and Sustainable Development \nDepartment (RSDD) as appropriate. Staff at the ADB resident missions in Afghanistan and Pakistan as well as those in \nTajikistan and Uzbekistan will also assist the secretariat. Close operational coordination between SARD and ECRD will \ncontinue to be ensured during TA implementation through the interdepartmental coordination mechanism developed \nduring the last 2 years. \n18 Assistance to each participating developing member country (DMC) will not begin until ADB receives no objection from \nthe government of the participating DMC.
