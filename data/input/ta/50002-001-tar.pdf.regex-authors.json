INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Nauru requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \ntechnical assistance (TA) to strengthen financial inclusion and financial sector development. \nThe TA will (i) improve financial literacy among different market segments; (ii) enhance financial \nsector policy to enable the sector\u2019s development; and (iii) contribute to regional knowledge \nsharing.1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The TA builds on previous \nADB assistance, which helped the government establish a banking agent after more than 15 \nyears without formal banking services on the island, and review the legal and institutional \nframework governing the sector.2 \n \n2.  The TA fact-finding mission concluded in a memorandum of understanding outlining the \nproposed TA\u2019s agreed impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing \narrangements,  and terms  of  reference. The TA  was  discussed  with government  agencies, \nprivate  sector  representatives,  and  development  partners.  The  TA  aligns  with  the  Nauru \nNational Sustainable Development Strategy, 2005\u20132020 and ADB\u2019s Interim Pacific Approach.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Nauru is one of ADB\u2019s smallest members, with a population of about 10,000 and total \nland area of 21 square kilometers. The country\u2019s remoteness and small size translate into major \ndevelopment impediments, including weak institutional capacity, a narrow economic base, very \nlimited private sector opportunities, and macroeconomic volatility. Nauru has a troubled financial \nhistory, including the mismanagement and collapse of the state-owned Bank of Nauru, which \neffectively ceased operations in 1998, and the Nauru Phosphate Royalties Trust, which was \nplaced in receivership in 2004. Nauru was blacklisted by the Financial Action Taskforce, an \ninter-governmental body, in 2000 due to concerns over its offshore financial center (resulting in \nits closure in 2004 and the removal of Nauru from the blacklist in 2005). These events severely \naffected Nauru\u2019s financial reputation, both domestically and internationally, and this continues to \nimpede financial inclusion and sector development. \n \n4.  Nauru\u2019s economy is undergoing major structural changes that heighten the imperative of \nstrengthening financial inclusion and sector development. After collapsing in the late 1990s \namid declining phosphate exports (Nauru\u2019s key historical income source), the economy is now \nexperiencing a resurgence, with substantial windfall income from its regional asylum seeker and \nrefugee program and increased fishing license revenue reflecting improvements in regional \nfisheries management. Many refugees (thus far about 850) have been integrated into the local \ncommunity  and  could  provide  a  substantial  economic  boost  and  help  address  local  skill \nshortages.  Improving  financial  inclusion  and  financial  sector  development  are  important \nelements in responding to these changes. Nauruan households are more flush with cash than \nthey have been since the early 1990s.4 Underlying demand for financial services is, therefore, \nlikely to be high. However, effective demand is mitigated by low financial literacy and the very \nlimited range of financial services available on the island. Importantly, current household income \nlevels could prove transitory, as Nauru\u2019s ability to sustainably generate income at such levels \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 6 July 2016. \n2  ADB. 2013.

Manila. \n4  This  reflects  the  country\u2019s  economic  resurgence,  including  a  significant  expansion  in  government  outlays. \nHouseholds have also been receiving large payments from the liquidation of the Nauru Phosphate Royalties Trust. \n ", "2 \n \nremains uncertain. As such, private saving and investment are critical to sustainability and \nenabling future consumption. Meanwhile, the refugee population also needs to be able to make \nuse of financial services to support their livelihoods and successful economic integration. \n \n5.  Nauru regained access to formal banking services on the island in June 2015 after more \nthan a decade and a half without such access since the Bank of Nauru\u2019s collapse. With ADB \nassistance, the government established a banking agent with the Bendigo Adelaide Bank. The \ngovernment operates the banking agent, referred to locally as the Bendigo Bank. It offers a \nlimited set of standard deposit-taking products to customers in Nauru, including transaction, \nsavings, and term deposit accounts. Other ancillary services include ATM cards, debit cards \n(planned), phone and internet banking, and planned deployment of ready point-of-sale terminals \nwith smartphone accessibility at certain locations. About 5,700 accounts have been opened, \nand significant further expansion is expected through government-led initiatives, including a \nplanned cash transfer program for school-age children. The bank has a single office and five \nATMs locate around the island. Given Nauru\u2019s small size, this means that most of the population \ngenerally has access to the bank\u2019s services. \n \n6.  Despite the rapid uptake of new bank accounts, about 90% are transaction accounts. \nSavings accounts represent only about 7% of total accounts, while term deposit accounts are \nbarely in use. Account balances remain very low. Customers appear to be using the accounts \nprimarily for receiving payments rather than for conducting transactions, managing personal \nfinances, or accumulating savings. Although the average account balance is about A$7,300, the \nmedian account balance is only A$32. Most customers appear to use their accounts to receive \nsalary and wage payments, but immediately withdraw the majority of their funds upon receipt. \nTransaction volumes, therefore, also remain low.  \n \n7.  Low financial literacy is a key factor undermining greater uptake and more sophisticated \nuse of available financial services. Nauru\u2019s long economic malaise from the late 1990s to 2007 \nand the absence of a functioning bank since the collapse of the Bank of Nauru in 1998 mean \nmany Nauruans have limited familiarity with banking services and low financial literacy more \nbroadly. Moreover, many still have some distrust of banks after the Bank of Nauru\u2019s collapse. \nHowever, this also presents Nauru with a unique opportunity to leapfrog from a cash-based \nsystem to a more modern system using digital financial services. \n \n8.  The introduction of a wider range of financial services, including digital finance products, \nis also a priority to support financial inclusion and economic development. For example, the \nbusiness sector has demonstrated low interest in using existing services, as only 27 business \ntransaction accounts and no business term deposit accounts have been opened. Bendigo Bank \noffers a limited set of deposit accounts, and these are restricted to making electronic transfers \nwith accounts at Bendigo Adelaide Bank and at other Australian banks. International transfers to \naccounts outside Australia are prohibited, while the ability to make international transactions is \nlimited (though the planned introduction of a MasterCard debit card should help address this). \nOther financial service providers are limited and include a Western Union money transfer agent \nand an agent for Dominion Insurance of Fiji. However, Dominion only provides services to \nEigigu  Holdings,  the  state-owned  company  holding  the  agency  agreement.  With  Nauru\u2019s \neconomic resurgence, there is likely to be significant unmet demand for a wider range of \nservices, such as insurance, wealth products, foreign exchange transactions, consumer and \nbusiness lending, and trade finance. Improving internet and mobile phone coverage will also \nallow Nauru to leapfrog to digital finance approaches, including mobile banking. Digicel is the \nsole provider of mobile phone services and is interested in introducing mobile money products. \n \n ", "3   \n9.  Improving access to a broader range of financial services will require addressing several \nissues. Most important is overcoming Nauru\u2019s poor financial reputation and limited industry \nknowledge  about  the  potential  local  market,  particularly  given  the  current  situation  of  low \neffective demand. Tightening international standards for anti-money laundering and combating \nterrorism financing are also major impediments to market development. If more services are to \nbe made available, the government will need to establish an appropriate legal framework and \ndevelop a credible, though cost-efficient, regulatory and supervisory capability, including a well-\nbalanced approach to digital financial services. \n \n10.  Nauru\u2019s financial sector regulatory regime is out-of-date; it does not provide an adequate \nbasis  for  effective  financial  service  licensing,  regulation,  and  supervision;  and  there  is  no \nfinancial regulatory and supervisory body.5 To some extent, Nauru can rely on the regulation \nand  supervision  of foreign  authorities.  However,  some  degree  of  domestic  capacity  is  still \nneeded to cover residual concerns. For instance, foreign authorities will not generally regard the \nNauru operations of a foreign institution as being of high risk to that institution. There is also the \npossibility that actual or potential financial service firms may not operate under the jurisdiction of \nany (or any acceptable) foreign authority. A staged approach to building Nauru\u2019s regulatory \nframework will be needed, given the limited domestic institutional capacity, and should be based \non an assessment of the potential to introduce new financial services to the island. \n \n11.  The challenges facing Nauru are similar to many  of the region\u2019s other small island \neconomies, resulting from remoteness, small size, and weak institutions. Therefore, there is a \nneed to develop approaches and solutions, including digital ones, that are tailored to the small \nisland context. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The TA impact will be the improved ability of the local community to manage their \nfinances to save and invest for the future. This will be measured by an increase in the range of \nfinancial services available and in use on the island and by the ratio of private credit extension \nto gross domestic product. \n \n13.  The outcome will be increased effective use of prudently regulated financial services by \nthe Nauruan community. This will be measured by an increase in the average and median \naccount balances at Bendigo Bank, the total deposits and the number of savings and term \ndeposit  accounts  at  the  bank,  and  the  submission  of  a  new  financial  services  bill  to  the \nParliament. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA will have three areas of activities aligned with three outputs. The government will \nestablish a national financial inclusion task force (NFITF), chaired by the secretary of finance \nand including senior ministry officials and representatives from the community and business \nsector. The NFITF will guide, oversee, and help coordinate the TA activities. The NFITF will, in \nturn, receive support under the TA to help drive the overall policy agenda. \n \n15.  Output 1: Improved financial literacy. The TA will take a bottom-up approach, working \ndirectly with local partners who will take primary responsibility for delivering literacy activities. \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2014. The Regulation and Supervision of Financial Institution in the Republic of Nauru. Consultant\u2019s report. \nManila. \n ", "4 \n \nThe TA will draw upon ADB\u2019s financial literacy toolkit to design and support activities fit for the \nNauruan context, with a focus on helping the local community (including the refugee population) \nprogress to using digital financial services. The TA will support local partners to deliver financial \neducation activities by helping design the activities and providing capacity building (e.g., train-\nthe-trainer), technical support, educational materials, and financial support for activity costs as \nagreed. Local partners will make in-kind contributions, including staff time and the provision of \nfacilities. Identified local partners include Bendigo Bank, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry \nof Home Affairs, district councils, youth councils, Digicel, and Connect (a private provider of \ncommunity services). Including a variety of partners and approaches will allow the TA to reach \ndifferent market segments, particularly disadvantaged groups at the bottom of the pyramid. \n \n16.  Output  2:  Enhanced  financial  sector  policy  framework.  The  TA  will  assist  the \ngovernment to establish the NFITF and design its work program. It will conduct a financial \nservices demand study to help the government and potential market entrants better understand \nthe potential market and prioritize specific products for development. The demand study will \nassess  potential  demand  for  different  financial  services  across  various  market  segments \n(households,  small  businesses,  larger  businesses,  state-owned  enterprises,  and  the \ngovernment), particularly focused on disadvantaged groups at the bottom of the pyramid and on \ndigital financial services. The TA will work with the government, primarily the Ministry of Finance \nand the Ministry of Justice and Border Protection, to draft a financial services bill to provide the \nlegal framework for sector regulation and supervision. A particular focus will be on identifying an \nappropriate model for the Financial Services Commission, given Nauru\u2019s small size and thin \nlocal  capacity,  addressing  competition  issues,  developing  a  balanced  approach  to  digital \nfinancial services, adequately addressing anti-money laundering and combating the financing of \nterrorism  issues  (taking  into  account  the  Anti-Money  Laundering  Act  2008),  and  ensuring \ngender sensitivity and avoiding any inadvertent provisions that could negatively affect women. \nThis will build on the substantial work already completed under previous TA projects (footnotes \n2 and 3). \n \n17.  Output 3: Regional knowledge sharing. The TA will leverage its impact by contributing \nto knowledge and practices in the Pacific region. This will include participating in regional \nforums (e.g., Digital Finance week), disseminating the TA results to regional networks, and \ncontributing to the refinement of existing tool kits and sector guidance material. The TA will be \nable to contribute to regional knowledge on shifting from cash to digital services in rural and \nremote areas, determining demand for financial services in a weak private sector environment, \nand designing effective legal and institutional approaches to financial sector regulation and \nsupervision in small island states. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $400,000, of which $350,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Financial Sector Development Partnership Special Fund. 6 \n \n19.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of government staff time to \n(i) contribute to the design and implementation of financial literacy activities, (ii) help coordinate \nother local stakeholders involved in output delivery, (iii) participate in the development of the \ndraft financial services bill, and (iv) participate in selected regional forums and knowledge-\nsharing  activities.  The  government  will  also  provide  office  space,  ground  transport,  and \naccommodation for consultants, as well as other secretarial assistance and in-kind contributions. \n                                                \n6 Established by ADB. Financing partner: the Government of Luxembourg. \n ", "5   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  ADB will be the executing agency. The Ministry of Finance will be the implementing \nagency. The NFITF, with ADB participation, will be the key forum to guide, coordinate, and \ndetermine the TA activities. \n \n21.  The TA will be implemented over 36 months, from July 2016 to June 2019. It will require \nabout 7 intermittent person-months of international consulting input including (i) a financial \ninclusion  specialist  and  team  leader  (5  person-months)  and  (ii)  a  financial  regulation  and \nsupervision expert (2 person-months). The TA will also require a national consultant (finance \nspecialist) for 7 person-months. The financial inclusion specialist and team leader will (i) assist \nthe government to establish the NFITF and develop its initial work program; (ii) develop the \nfinancial  literacy  program  and  guide  implementation;  (iii)  develop  the  methodology,  guide \nimplementation, and prepare the final report for the financial services demand study; and (iv) \nundertake activities to support regional learning and replication. The financial regulation and \nsupervision expert will (i) prepare the draft financial services bill, including undertaking extensive \nconsultations with the government and other stakeholders on the proposed content; and (ii) \nparticipate in knowledge-sharing activities, as required. The national financial specialist will (i) \nwork with and support the NFITF, (ii) support the design and implementation of financial literacy \nactivities, (iii) implement the financial services demand study, (iv) participate in knowledge-\nsharing  activities  as  required,  and  (v)  provide  general  on-the-ground  support  for  the  TA. \nAppendix 3 outlines the terms of reference for consultants. \n \n22.  Consultants will be engaged following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time). ADB staff can be used as sector and thematic or \ntechnical experts and resource persons, and their travel-related expenses will be paid through \nthe TA.7 All goods procured under the TA will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as \namended  from  time  to  time).  TA  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  following  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n23.  TA progress will be monitored against activities, outputs, and outcomes described in the \ndesign and monitoring framework. ADB will assist the government in sharing all results, good \npractices,  and  lessons  through  reports  with  other  development  partners,  including  through \nNFITF meetings and brown bag seminars in ADB\u2019s Financial Sector Development community of \npractice. These will also be disseminated through meetings, workshops, seminars, and ADB \nand other websites. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nADB  administering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $350,000  to  the \nGovernment of Nauru to be financed on a grant basis by the Financial Sector Development \nPartnership  Special  Fund  for  Strengthening  Financial  Inclusion  and  Financial  Sector \nDevelopment, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n7  ADB, Budget, Personnel and Management Systems Department, and Strategy and Policy Department, 2013.
