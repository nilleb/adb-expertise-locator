The proposed project will support the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s \nefforts to address the escalating environmental deterioration and stress in the dryland ecosystems \nand loess areas along the Silk Road. It will seek to deliver outcomes that synthesize the lessons \nlearned and forge multi-dimensional interventions for integrated grassland, wetland, and forested \nareas restoration and management. A phased approach, supported by successful demonstration \nsites, are integral to the package of interventions to build awareness of the nature of the problems \nand the solutions being proposed. The government has requested for a $200.0 million loan from \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) to finance an ecological protection and rehabilitation project \nin Gansu, Shaanxi, and Qinghai provinces. The project will be aligned with the following impacts: \n(i)  ecological  restoration  and  environmental  governance  in  key  regions  crucial  to  national \necological security promoted; and (ii) ecological protection and restoration projects in order to \ncreate more jobs and raise incomes implemented, as envisaged in the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan \nfor Economic and Social Development of the PRC, 2016\u20132020. The project will have three \noutputs: (i) degradation of forests, wetlands, and grasslands in the loess areas arrested and \nreversed; (ii) livelihood diversification in loess areas implemented; and (iii) Institutional capacity \nfor integrated ecosystem management strengthened. These outputs will result in the following \noutcome: ecological resilience and rural livelihood security in the loess areas enhanced. The \nproposed project is included in ADB\u2019s lending program for 2020.1 \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n2.
