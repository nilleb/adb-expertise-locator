The  Government  of  Samoa  has  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to \nprovide project preparatory technical assistance (TA) for a follow\u2013up project to the ongoing \nEducation Sector Project (ESP),1 included in the 2002 Country Strategy and Program Update \nfor Samoa. The TA Fact\u2013Finding Mission visited Samoa from 4 to 17 June 2003, and reached \nan understanding with the Government on the TA justification, objectives, scope, cost estimates, \nfinancing plan, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference for consultants.2 The TA \nframework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Abject  poverty  is  not  prevalent  in  Samoa,  but  lack  of  opportunity  and  vulnerability \ncontribute to hardship. Factors such as remoteness, natural disasters, and limited economic and \ninstitutional capacity add to vulnerability. The two groups suffering most from lack of opportunity \nare urban villagers with inadequate land for subsistence production, and rural villagers with \nlimited opportunities for earning cash.3 These groups often have limited access to quality social \nservices  such  as  education.4  A  clear  relationship  exists  between  education  and  poverty \nreduction. Poverty entails not only simple income deprivation but also lack of empowerment, \nknowledge, opportunity, and capital. Education inculcates the skills and knowledge necessary to \nimprove  the  quality  of  life,  become  productive,  and  increase  income\u2013earning  potential, \nultimately  producing  intergenerational  benefits.  Providing  greater  access  to  education  and \ntraining programs will serve the country\u2019s human resource requirements. \n \n3.  Education Structure. The education system consists of 8 years of primary (ages 5\u201314 \nyears), 5 years of secondary (15\u201319), and 4 years of higher education. National examinations \nare  held  in  years  8  and  12.  For  year  13,  a  regional  examination  provides  access  to  the \nuniversity preliminary year. Scholarships provide opportunities for tertiary education abroad for a \nthird of students in their university preliminary year. The National University of Samoa (NUS), \nSamoa Polytechnic, and some other postsecondary institutions in Apia also offer postsecondary \neducation. The Ministry of Education, Sports, and Culture (MESC) is responsible for policy \nformulation,  guidance,  and  supervision  of  all  government  schools  and  institutions.  Village \ncommittees run most primary schools and are responsible for setting, collecting, and spending \nschool  fees;  constructing  and  maintaining  buildings;  and  providing  consumables.  The \nGovernment funds teachers\u2019 salaries, some consumables, and initial sets of textbooks every 5 \nyears.  \n \n4.  Since the Government adopted the education policies and strategies for 1995\u20132005, \nconsiderable  progress has  been made  in  (i)  textbooks and  learning  resources  for  primary \neducation; (ii) developing a new secondary curriculum and textbooks; (iii) education for special \nneeds; (iv) early childhood education; and (v) bilingual language policy. MESC\u2019s management \ncapacity has been strengthened. These laudable achievements paved the way to identify further \nsector developments. More interventions will ensure that sufficient well\u2013qualified students are \nprepared for private sector opportunities generated by ongoing economic and public sector \nreforms.  \n \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2000. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan and \nTechnical Assistance Grant to the Independent State of Samoa for the Education Sector Project. Manila. \n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 20 January 2003.  \n3 ADB. 2000. Samoa 2000: Building on Recent Reforms. Manila, pp. 7\u20138.  \n4 The initial poverty and social assessment is provided in Appendix 2. ", "2  \n5.  Access. In 2003 the gross enrollment rates were 85% at the primary and 83% at the \nsecondary levels.5 The gender gap in access and retention rates is insignificant. However, since \nthe statistical data for net and gross enrollment rates show some inconsistencies, the TA will \nundertake  a  gender  analysis  along  with  poverty  and  social  assessment.  Samoa  has  141 \ngovernment, 15 mission, and 3 private schools at the primary level; and 25, 15, and 1 at the \nsecondary level, respectively. Every village has a primary school, and the country has about \n259 surplus primary classrooms. Some classrooms or schools were not constructed on the \nbasis of need. Some areas have too many schools for too few children within a very short \nwalking  distance.  Ultimately,  this  continuous  expansion  will  take  its  toll  on  government \nresources as well as school quality and student performance. The TA will examine the primary \nschool policy regarding expansion and recommend policies. The TA will also identify schools \nthat  need  refurbishing  in  disadvantaged  areas.  The  number  of  full  secondary  schools  (or \ncolleges) is limited, mainly in urban areas, especially Apia. Savaii has only one full secondary \nschool. The Government is committed to equalizing access to a unified stream of secondary \neducation and began implementing this policy in 2002. Secondary schools in disadvantaged \nareas up to year 13 should be upgraded. Equitable cost\u2013sharing measures at the secondary \nlevel should also be introduced without increasing poor households\u2019 financial burden. Targeted \nscholarships (e.g., sports scholarships) for the most disadvantaged should also be introduced.  \n \n6.  Quality and Efficiency of Education. Graduates have low levels of functional literacy \nand numeracy. Repetition and dropout rates are high. Students completing secondary school \nand passing examinations to enter postsecondary and university courses had deficient basic \nnumeracy and literacy skills. Total graduates of year 13 represent about 20% of all yearly \nschool\u2013leavers, and even the best of this cohort were found deficient (footnote 3, p. 118). In \n2003 the repetition rate was high in years 1 (6%) and 8 (4%), and in years 11 (5%), 12 (10%), \nand 13 (9%). Overall, the dropout rate in years 1\u20132 was 5%, and increased to 9% in years 8\u20139. \nAt the secondary level, the dropout rate was high in years 10\u201311 (12%) and 12\u201313 (38%), \nindicating that more than half the secondary school students drop out before completing the \ncycle. One main cause of dropping out is the low level of learning outcomes, as demonstrated in \nthe year\u2013end examinations. Another cause seems to be related to high tuition fees. Primary \neducation, the basic building block of formal education, should be strengthened by improving its \nquality and efficiency. Regulatory and supervisory measures for quality assurance need to be \nupdated and adjusted to address geographical and other disparities. The underlying causes of \ndropping out should be examined. \n \n7.  Well\u2013trained  teachers  with  adequate  skills  to  transmit  knowledge  and  manage \nclassrooms  are  in  short  supply.  Low  salaries  and  limited  opportunities  for  professional \ndevelopment impede attracting high performers to teaching and retaining those already in the \nprofession. Graduates from the NUS Faculty of Education are less competent in basic lesson \nplanning and delivery than those from the former Western Samoa Teacher Training College \n(WSTTC). The merger of WSTTC with NUS changed course offerings for preservice training, \nreduced  the  number  of  courses,  and  made  many  compulsory  elements  optional.  Teacher \neffectiveness is also impaired by a shortage of teaching and learning resources as well as \nlimited facilities and equipment, especially in the practical subjects. The Government intends to \nimprove the quality and intake of preservice training by offering incentives and restructuring the \ncareer path, and improving the content and methodology of teacher training programs. In\u2013\nservice programs will be reviewed to ensure that they are effective, particularly with respect to \npedagogical delivery, curriculum content, examination, and assessment. The primary curriculum \n                                                 \n5 The information management system requires a review as it reports a higher net enrollment rate than gross \nenrolment rate for primary education. ", "    3\nis almost 30 years old and irrelevant. A curriculum policy framework and subject and year\u2013level \ncurriculum statements are needed at the primary level. The Government intends to renew the \nprimary curriculum; provide teachers\u2019 manuals, textbooks, and learning materials; and design \nrelated in\u2013service training programs. External funding agency\u2013supported secondary curriculum \ndevelopment work is already ongoing. A secondary education curriculum framework for years \n9\u201313  is  being  developed,  and  a  new  single\u2013stream  curriculum  for  years  9\u201312  is  being \nimplemented. Year\u201313 curriculum statements will be developed in 2004. \n \n8.  A  system  of  periodic,  sample\u2013based  student  learning  assessment  would  help  to \nevaluate curriculum and teacher effectiveness. The end\u2013of\u2013cycle examination system should be \nreformed to improve reliability and test security and to guarantee that examinations achieve \nsystem\u2013wide  learning  objectives.  A  staff  development  plan  is  required  for  teachers  in \ndisadvantaged areas. The Government is concerned about student and teacher absenteeism as \nwell as teacher competency in teaching and managing the classrooms. These problems can be \nsolved by strengthening the school inspection system. The MESC recurrent budget provides for \nreprinting of primary school textbooks to ensure resupply after 5 years. If a shortage of primary \ntextbooks occurs during the 5 years, a policy change may be needed. A supply arrangement for \ntextbooks to secondary schools has yet to be developed. A number of measures have been \nincorporated in MESC\u2019s Corporate Plan for 2003\u20132006 to address these issues. \n \n9.  Government\u2019s Priorities. The Government is committed to achieve education for all \n(EFA)  and  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs).  Education  is  the  priority  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s strategy to develop Samoa, which has already completed a number of activities. \nDespite its many achievements, the Government recognizes remaining issues related to pre\u2013 \nand in\u2013service teacher training, primary and secondary curriculum, examination, assessment \nsystem, lack of learning materials, and unequal academic outcomes. The education system also \nhas to prepare people for improving productivity and opportunities in the workplace, including \nopportunities in other countries, as remittances contribute to economic growth and reduce \nhardship. The Government is determined to equalize access to quality EFA. To achieve its \nequity  goals,  the  Government  may  need  to  allocate  more  resources  toward  primary  and \nsecondary education, while recognizing the continuing need to support tertiary education.6 In \naccordance with the Government\u2019s policy directions, ADB has been helping address a range of \neducation  issues  through  ESP,  focusing  extensively  on  rehabilitation  and  expansion  of  7 \nprimary and 12 secondary schools, and providing furniture and library books. These schools are \nmainly concentrated in the greater Apia area. In June 2003 one secondary and six primary \nschools were completed, and five secondary schools were under construction, with four at the \ndesign stage. All 19 project schools are expected to be completed by August 2004. ESP will \nimprove student access mainly to schools in the greater Apia area. Through the proposed \nproject, ADB will complement ESP with a review of policy and processes at the primary and \nsecondary levels to improve school efficiency and quality, and students\u2019 academic outcomes \nnationwide, including access to an improved learning environment in disadvantaged areas. The \npreparatory TA will also review and, if needed, revise the basis for selecting schools that require \nupgrading and quality interventions, using social targeting to identify disadvantaged groups in \nSavaii and rural areas. \n  \n10.  Harmonization  of  External  Support.  External  funding  concentrates  heavily  on  the \n                                                 \n6 In 1999 the Government\u2019s recurrent expenditure per student for NUS was about $2,144; for Samoa Polytechnic \n$2,790; and for the government colleges, $446. Malifa primary schools received $156 per student, and village \nprimary schools, $132. External assistance was concentrated in the postsecondary and tertiary levels (71%) in \n1998\u20131999, reflecting government preference to direct donor grant\u2013funded assistance to this level.  \n ", "4  \neducation sector. The Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), European \nUnion, New Zealand Agency for International Development, Japan International Cooperation \nAgency  (JICA),  United  Nations  agencies,  and  others  have  been  involved  in  a  number  of \neducation projects. However, limited financial and human resources, compartmentalization of \neducation projects, multiple planning requirements for different agencies, the short\u2013term nature \nof projects, and the varied structure and parameters that funding agencies work under together \nweaken the overall impact of aid. Thus, government\u2013led donor coordination is supported to \nsystematically address emerging issues in education, taking a long\u2013term sector\u2013wide approach, \ninstead of addressing the issues in a piecemeal manner. To avoid duplication, the project will \nbuild on the achievements of other donors\u2019 ongoing initiatives after the project proponents \nanalyze  the  gaps  in  the  education  sector  and  discuss  them  with  the  Government  and \nstakeholders. Possibilities for project cofinancing will be explored. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The purpose of the TA is to help the Government prepare and deliver a strategy to \nimprove  the  learning  outcomes  of  primary  and  secondary  students  by  addressing  access, \nquality, efficiency, capacity, and policy issues in the education sector. The TA will focus on \nsystematic, sustainable, and equitable approaches to relevant and efficient learning systems for \nall primary and secondary schoolchildren to achieve the Government\u2019s education goals. The TA \noutputs will include (i) an updated education sector policy and strategy and (ii) a feasibility study \nof investments suitable for ADB financing.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The TA will have two parts.7 Part 1 will focus on an education sector review leading to \nstrategic  plan  formulation  for  primary,  secondary,  and  teacher  education.  The  TA  will  (i) \nexamine lessons from implementation of the education policy and strategy of 1995\u20132005, and \nidentify their gaps and impact; (ii) document government policy priorities, including financing of \neducation, for the next 9 years (2006\u20132014) in the context of EFA and MDGs. Based on lessons \nand best practices, as well as the Government\u2019s priorities, the TA will prepare an in\u2013depth \nanalytical study of pertinent issues in primary, secondary, and teacher education, including \nissues  and  problems not  yet  anticipated  or overcome  by  the  Government.  This  stage  will \nconclude with agreement on the key issues and strategies that part 2 should focus on. Under \npart 2, a feasibility study will translate the strategic plans into specific action plans. The TA \nconsultants will prepare a policy matrix detailing policies and strategies that may be implemented \nin conjunction with the project, including provision of an adequate recurrent budget for primary, \nsecondary, and teacher education. As part of a broad consultative process, the TA will be \nimplemented  through  discussion  with  stakeholders  and  the  existing  education  steering \ncommittee (ESC). ADB will be furnished electronic copies of discussions and working papers, \nincluding  a  brief  report  on  agreements.  The  TA  will  facilitate  workshops  and  focus  group \nmeetings to solicit advice and recommendations from stakeholders, including MESC, NUS, civil \nsociety, nongovernment organizations, churches, mission and private schools, external funding \nagencies, school management committees, ESC, and beneficiaries. The TA will recommend \nways to ensure relevance of the educational and training programs to meet the country\u2019s needs, \nand include a participatory project design workshop to seek stakeholder inputs. \n \n                                                 \n7 TA activities are described in detail in Appendix 4. ", "    5\n13.  TA consultants will prepare a detailed project design, covering the rationale, objectives, \nproject  framework,  detailed  components,  policy  targets,  monitoring  indicators  (including \npoverty/hardship  impact  indicators),  benefits,  risks,  social  analysis,  costs  and  financial \nsustainability analysis, implementation plan, and recommended policy adjustments to sustain \nproject effectiveness. The need for additional ADB TA to improve the quality of primary and \nsecondary education in the most disadvantaged rural areas will also be examined.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n14.   The TA is estimated to cost $450,000 equivalent, including a foreign exchange cost of \n$289,000 and a local currency cost of $161,000 equivalent (Appendix 3). ADB will finance \n$350,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $61,000 equivalent of the \nlocal currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The \nGovernment  of  Samoa  will  contribute  $100,000  equivalent  to  finance  the  remaining  local \ncurrency cost. The Government of Samoa has been advised that TA approval does not commit \nADB to financing any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  will  be  the  TA  Executing  Agency.  MESC  will  be  the \nImplementing Agency. The ESC will provide overall guidance to the TA. ADB will engage the \nservices of international and domestic consultants, with relevant experience in all aspects of the \nspecified scope of work. In total, 11.5 person\u2013months of international and 8 person\u2013months of \ndomestic  consulting  services  will  be  required.  The  consultants\u2019  terms  of  reference  are  in \nAppendix 4. All consultants\u2019 services will be engaged through a firm, using quality\u2013 and cost\u2013\nbased selection and a simplified technical proposal, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  selection  and \nengagement of domestic consultants. The Government will provide a qualified counterpart team \nof at least two specialists to assist the international consultants, including by establishing liaison \nwith  agencies  and  institutions  and  obtaining  data.  The  consultants  will  provide  their  own \nequipment and use the existing project management team office. \n \n16.  The TA is planned to run for 5 months, from January to June 2004. It will include an \ninception workshop in the first month with all stakeholder groups to confirm approaches and \nmethodologies to be used, discuss the issues to be addressed, and ensure close coordination \namong stakeholders throughout TA implementation. ADB will be furnished electronic files of the \ndiscussion and working papers, including a brief report on the agreements reached. The TA \nteam  will  prepare  a  midterm  report  and  disseminate  the  findings  in  a  workshop  with  the \nstakeholders after 8 weeks. The TA team will prepare a draft final report in conjunction with the \nfeasibility study for the loan project. The ESC will review and finalize the study 14 weeks after \nTA inception, when loan fact\u2013finding will take place. The consultants will organize a workshop \nwith stakeholders to finalize the participatory project design after 16 weeks. The consultants will \nthen finalize the report. \n \nIV.   THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $350,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Samoa for preparing the Education Sector Project II, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national priority in the country  Sector  Identified  as  a  national  priority  in  country  poverty \npoverty analysis? Yes  partnership agreement? Yes \nContribution of sector/subsector to reduce poverty in the country: \n \nSamoa does not have abject poverty, but pockets of poverty and poverty of opportunity exist, including lack of education \nand access to health services, lack of economic assets and employment opportunities, social exclusion, and political \nmarginalization. Vulnerability is another major factor contributing to poverty. While the gross enrollment rate is 85% at \nthe primary level, participation and completion rates are low. Most people lack access to quality primary and secondary \neducation, resulting in high repetition and dropout rates, making the system very inefficient. Even students who \ncomplete the full cycle of primary and secondary education often lack the skills required by the economy or for self\u2013\nemployment. Thus, dropouts and out\u2013of\u2013school youth continuously add to the ranks of the vulnerable, ultimately falling \nprey to social ills, exclusion, and poverty.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s education policies and strategies for 1995\u20132005 focus on major education reforms, and these have \nsuccessfully completed a number of activities. Enrollment rates in Samoa are very impressive compared to those in \nother Pacific countries. Still, the gains have not been equally shared. Poor students drop out without acquiring useful \nskills. The project will address the gaps in the education sector by providing better school facilities, especially \nrefurbishing primary schools and expanding the unified secondary education system in poor rural areas, renewing the \nprimary curriculum, providing textbooks for secondary students, strengthening pre\u2013 and in\u2013service teacher training \nprograms, and improving the examination and assessment system. The project will address factors that contribute to \ndropping out and inefficiency. \n \n \nB.

However, enrollment rates are inconsistent, and further investigation will determine if \ngender disparities exist. Poverty of opportunity and social analyses by gender and region are needed to identify major \ndifficulties and issues faced by primary and secondary school students, children with special needs, and the rural poor. \nBased on the analysis, a strategy will be devised to address the issues and guide project implementation. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \nParticipation strategy required:  Yes \n \nThe participation of stakeholders during project design is essential. Consultations with different education and training \nagencies, local leaders, civil society, communities, and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) will be arranged at different \nlevels. Besides workshops to discuss the issues, timely consultation with government staff will be held during the \ntechnical assistance (TA). Schoolteachers, principals, parents, and students will be consulted during TA implementation. \nThe timing, venue, and method of organizing public consultation will be arranged so that disadvantaged groups can \nattend and have a chance to speak out. Special attention will be paid to consultation with local people about the selection \nof school sites and of beneficiaries. The final project design framework will be done in consultation with the stakeholders \nin a participatory project design workshop. \n \nThe full participation of project beneficiaries and stakeholders in the whole project cycle, starting from the project design \nstage and throughout project implementation, monitoring, and evaluation will be taken into account.
