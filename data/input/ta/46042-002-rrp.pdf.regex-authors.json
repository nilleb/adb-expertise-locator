THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Shaanxi Mountain Road Safety Demonstration \nProject.1 \n \n2.  The project will improve accessibility and road safety by (i) upgrading and introducing \nsafety treatments on trunk and rural roads in the hazardous Qinba Mountains area in southeast \nShaanxi,2 (ii) implementing a crash reduction program involving only road safety treatments on \nother  hazardous  rural  roads,  and  (iii)  strengthening  road  safety  design  and  management \npractices and introducing road safety education and community awareness programs.3 This will \ncontribute to poverty reduction by lowering transport costs and enabling economic activity, and \nby reducing fatalities and serious injuries on the trunk and rural road network. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Shaanxi Province is one of the least-developed provinces with per capita rural income in \n2012 at 73% of the national average, ranking 26th among the 31 administrative provinces and \nautonomous regions in the PRC. On a gross domestic product (GDP) per capita basis, Shaanxi \nranks  15th  (CNY38,564  in  2012).  Fifty  of  Shaanxi\u2019s  107  counties  are  designated  national \npoverty counties.4 Shaanxi has a total land area of 205,800 square kilometers and a population \nof 37.53 million (2013 census). The southern prefectures of Ankang and Shangluo (in which the \nproject  roads  are  located)  have  GDP  per  capita  of  CNY18,878  (Ankang)  and  CNY18,097 \n(Shangluo), both less than half the Shaanxi average. The net average income per head for rural \nhouseholds is CNY5,763 compared with CNY20,734 for urban Shaanxi households. \n \n4.  The Qinba Mountains area is especially poor with a poverty incidence exceeding 30% in \n2012. It is one of 11 high-poverty areas targeted for concentrated interventions under the China \nRural Poverty Alleviation and Development Program (2011\u20132020). Both Ankang and Shangluo, \ntwo prefecture-level cities in the Qinba Mountains area, have strong potential for expansion of \nthe agriculture, mineral, and hydropower industries, and for the development of tourism. \n \n5.  A lack of transport infrastructure is constraining economic growth and poverty reduction. \nDue to road network and capacity limitations, the rural population suffers from a lack of access \nto markets and economic opportunities. High transport costs directly limit the extent of trade and \nconstrain residents\u2019 income-earning potential. Better road connections, with improved capacity, \nwill enable southeast Shaanxi to realize its full economic potential. \n \n6.  In the PRC, it is reported that 65,225 people were killed in road crashes in 2010.5 The \nWorld Health Organization, however, estimates 275,983 road crash deaths at a rate of 20.5 \n                                                           \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Qinba Mountains area covers the Qinling and Bashan mountain ranges and spans Shaanxi, Hubei, Sichuan, \nand Henan provinces. Within Shaanxi, six prefectures are included in this area. \n3  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Shaanxi Mountain \nRoad Safety Demonstration Project under Shaanxi Trunk Roads Improvement (TA 8440-PRC). \n4  Counties with an average annual rural per capita net income of less than CNY2,300. \n5  World Health Organization. 2013. Global Status Report on Road Safety: Supporting a Decade of Action. Geneva. \np. 99. \n ", "2 \ndeaths per 100,000 population in PRC.6 Between 2005 and 2012, the number of reported \ncrashes has declined while the proportion of reported crashes resulting in fatalities increased\u2014\n29% in 2012 compared with 22% in 2005\u2014indicating a reporting trend toward fewer but more \nserious crashes.7  \n \n7.  Reported road fatalities (9,831) and injuries (30,021) in Shaanxi from 2008 to 2012 cost \n$5 billion. Ankang and Shangluo are experiencing road fatality and injury rates that far exceed \nthe provincial and national averages with a crash rate 4 times the national average for roads of \nsimilar class in the PRC8. Analysis of 1,000 kilometers (km) of roads in the Qinba Mountains \narea found that road fatalities and injuries cost $84 million (0.3% of Shaanxi\u2019s GDP) per year \nfrom 2007 to 2011. There is an obvious and urgent need to improve road safety provisions \nthroughout the project area. \n \n8.  Most crash victims are male vulnerable road users9 aged 21\u201365 living in rural areas.10 \nAcross transport modes, road fatalities involve vehicle and truck occupants (28%), motorcyclists \n(28%), pedestrians (26%), cyclists (17%), and other (1%). As motorcycles and nonmotorized \ntransport modes are most commonly used by the poor, reducing road crashes and related \nimpacts will contribute to poverty reduction and inclusive economic growth. \n \n9.  The project area\u2014Xunyang, Hanyin, and Shangnan counties in Ankang and Shangluo\u2014\ncontains many high-risk trunk and rural roads with significant traffic volume and a mix of heavy \nvehicles,  automobiles,  motorcycles,  nonmotorized  vehicles,  and  pedestrians.  Many  of  the \ncrashes in the area are attributed to driver error aggravated by the steep, mountainous terrain. \nIn many cases, dangerous road conditions can be addressed by modest design interventions at \nrelatively low cost. The development and institutionalization of modern road safety design and \nmanagement approaches will lead to a sustainable reduction in road deaths and injuries. \n \n10.  Trunk roads. The highways in the Qinba Mountains area are narrow, with inadequate \nsight distances, very tight curves, and low axle load limits. Vehicle ownership in the area has \ngrown rapidly, and ongoing major construction projects have led to increased heavy truck traffic \nleading to accelerated pavement deterioration. Traffic has grown at nearly 10% per year and \nsections of the network will reach capacity within 5 years. Rehabilitation and upgrading of the \ntrunk  road  network  is  required  to  ensure  that  adequate  capacity  can  facilitate  economic \ndevelopment, and improve accessibility for the local population. On the three project trunk \nroads, the annual cost per km of road crash fatalities and injuries per km are several times \nhigher than the national averages, resulting in a combined total cost of $40 million (footnote 8). \nBy incorporating best road safety design practices on the trunk road upgrades, the incidence \nand cost of road crashes can be significantly reduced. \n \n11.  Rural roads. The unpaved rural road network constrains agricultural development and \nlimits access to (i) markets for sale of produce and purchase of agricultural inputs; (ii) collection \nor  processing  stations  for  the  sale  of  cash  crops;  (iii)  towns  and  cities  for  employment \n                                                           \n6  World Health Organization. 2013. Global Status Report on Road Safety: Supporting a Decade of Action. Geneva. \np. 255. Fatality rates average 21.5 per 100,000 population in low-income countries, 19.5 in middle-income \ncountries, and 10.3 in high-income countries.  \n7  National Bureau of Statistics of China. 2013.

During  the  wet  season,  the  existing  unpaved  rural  roads  become \nimpassable because of landslides or poor road surfaces, leading to perishable crops being lost \nand reducing access to employment and social services. Rural roads in the project area exhibit \na range in level of safety. Road fatalities, and injuries on the most unsafe rural road included in \nthe project cost up to $6 million annually. Targeted strategic investments on the rural road \nnetwork will improve both access and transport safety. \n \n12.  Road safety management and education. On road rehabilitation and road upgrade \nprojects, the Shaanxi Provincial Transport Department (SPTD) ensures that safety provisions \naddress  known  hazardous  road  sections.  To  guide  this  responsibility,  the  Highway  Safety \nEnhancement Project11 was launched in 2004. The department of traffic police conducts road \nsafety publicity and education programs for middle and primary schools. A determined focus on \nimproving education and community awareness programs will help raise awareness of the \npublic health threat posed by dangerous driving behavior and hazardous road conditions. \n \n13.  Strategic relevance. As ADB\u2019s largest developing member country, the PRC suffers the \ngreatest  road  crash  fatality  and  serious  injury  toll.  Successful  project  implementation  and \npromotion  of  the  road  safety  project  design  approach  will  encourage  replication  in  other \nprovinces of the PRC and in other developing member countries. The project aligns with ADB's \ncountry partnership strategy for the PRC, 2011\u2013201512 and its sustainable transport initiative,13 \nin the areas of road safety and social sustainability, and the Midterm Review of Strategy 202014 \ngiving emphasis to infrastructure financing in underdeveloped areas.  \n \n14.  ADB\u2019s participation will help the PRC mobilize resources with international expertise to \ndemonstrate innovative design solutions, and it will help build local and national road safety \ncapability.15 Importantly the project will encourage the use of performance-tracking tools to \nbenchmark and monitor road safety performance over time. ADB\u2019s engagement in Shaanxi \nsince 2001 has highlighted the need for an early focus on developing safeguards, procurement \nand financial management capacity at the implementing agency level.16  \n \nB.  Impacts and Outcome \n15.  The impacts will be reduction of road crash fatalities and serious injuries, and provision \nof efficient and safe all-weather accessibility in southeast Shaanxi Province. The outcome will \nbe a safer and more efficient trunk and rural road network in southeast Shaanxi Province. \n                                                           \n11 The Highway Safety Enhancement Project involved a CNY25.34 billion investment over 10 years on 366,000 km of \nroads to remedy safety problems. The successful preparation of this Shaanxi Mountain Road Safety Demonstration \nProject influenced the Ministry of Transport to adopt the ChinaRAP road safety design methodology on phase 2 of \nthe Highway Safety Enhancement Project, which will be considered by the State Council in 2015.  \n12 ADB. 2012.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n29.  The project includes subclass and roads of classes II, III, and IV (PRC road standard \nclasses).  While  compliance  with  the  PRC  road  design  standards  improves  safety,  the \ndemonstration budget was committed to improvements over and above those necessary for \ncode compliance. The $50 million demonstration on the 896 km of project roads provided an \nopportunity to illustrate international good design practice.20 In the absence of road safety \ndesign modifications, it was estimated that 26,985 deaths and serious injuries would occur on \nthe project roads over a 20-year period. With the agreed design modifications, it was estimated \nthat 5,407 fewer deaths and serious injuries will eventuate. This represents a 25% reduction in \ndeaths and serious injuries, with the associated investment generating a road safety benefit\u2013\ncost ratio of 6.7:1.21 \n \n30.  The  ChinaRAP  Safer  Roads Investment  Plan  identified  countermeasures that  could \naffordably  and  economically  reduce  risk,  thereby  preventing  deaths  and  serious  injuries.22 \nCountermeasures from 93 options were considered for each 100-meter road segment, ranging \nfrom low-cost road markings and pedestrian refuges to higher-cost intersection upgrades and \nfull road duplication. Design features that will improve safety include roadside safety barriers, \npaved  shoulders,  realignments,  enhanced  skid  resistance,  traffic  calming,  and  pedestrian \ncrossings. The project demonstration purpose was served by introducing countermeasures not \ncommonly used in the PRC including vehicle-activated signs, flexible delineator posts, colored \npavement treatments at the entry to villages, and raised pedestrian crossings at schools. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n31.  Economic analysis. The project is economically viable. The economic internal rate of \nreturn (EIRR) and net present value (NPV) at a discount rate of 12% for the upgrade of the \nthree trunk roads are 16.8% and CNY365 million (S102), 25.5% and CNY309 million (G316), \n                                                           \n20 Inclusive of contingency allocations the road safety only budget was assigned to (i) output 1: trunk road upgrades \n($32.12  million),  (ii)  output  2:  rural  road  upgrades  ($2.68  million),  (iii)  output  3:  crash  reduction  program \n($13.83 million), and (iv) output 4: institutional development ($1.37 million). \n21 ADB. 2015. Shaanxi Mountain Road Safety Demonstration: Final Road Safety Report Part 1. Consultant\u2019s report. \nManila (TA 8440-PRC, p. 5). \n22 ChinaRAP is a collaboration between the Ministry of Transport Research Institute of Highway and the International \nRoad Assessment Program (iRAP). The iRAP road safety design methodology uses road attribute risk factors \n(often called crash modification factors) to relate road attributes and crash rates. These are used to assess the \nlikelihood that a crash will occur, and the severity of those that do occur, for both existing roads and road designs. \nThe methodology involves an economic analysis of road safety countermeasure options, with benefits expressed in \nterms of the value of deaths and serious injuries prevented. \n ", "8 \nand 26.7% and CNY607 million (S224), including safety benefits. The eight rural road upgrades \nresult in an EIRR of 22.0% and an NPV of CNY193 million (weighted average). The crash \nreduction program returned an EIRR of 57% and an NPV of CNY455 million. The sensitivity \nanalysis confirmed there is little risk to the project\u2019s viability.  \n \n32.  Financial analysis. The project has no revenue-generating components. Construction \nand incremental operating costs do not represent a substantial financial burden on SPTD, \nAnkang City, and Shangnan County, all of which have sufficient financial capacity to provide \ncounterpart funds, cover operation and maintenance costs, and service the ADB loan. \n \nC.  Governance \n33.  All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended  to  date)  will  be  included  in  all  procurement  documents  and  contracts.  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government,  the  executing \nagency  and  implementing  agencies,  and  the  FFPO.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 20). An assessment of financial \nmanagement  capacity  indicates  that  the  executing  agency  and  one  implementing  agency \n(AKTB)  carefully  follow  the  PRC  policies  and  procedures  for  accounting  and  financial \nmanagement.  The  financial  management  assessment  recommended  capacity  development \nmeasures  to  ensure  the  implementing  agencies  are  able  to  meet  financial  management \nrequirements. It was concluded that the overall pre-mitigation financial management risk is \nmoderate. The staff of the FFPO and the implementing agencies will undertake targeted training \nto adequately mitigate the risks starting in the last quarter of 2015. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n34.  Poverty and social. Two of the three project counties are designated national poverty \ncounties (Xunyang and Shangnan). The remote mountainous location, harsh geographic and \nclimatic  conditions,  and  inadequate  road  infrastructure  are  major  obstacles  to  economic \ndevelopment and contribute to persistent poverty in the project area. The project will improve \nroad connectivity, reduce transport costs and travel time, and improve access to economic and \nemployment opportunities and social services. Local people will benefit from enhanced access, \nimproved  mobility,  and  skilled  and  unskilled  employment  opportunities  generated  during \nconstruction. The project will result in 25% fewer fatalities and serious injuries than would have \nbeen  the  case  without  the  project.  This  constitutes  a  substantial  reduction  in  social  and \neconomic costs from road crashes. \n \n35.  Gender.  The  project  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming  and  involves  a \ngender  action  plan.23 Targets  for  women\u2019s  employment  and  project  participation  are  key \nfeatures embodied in the design and monitoring framework and the social development action \nplan. \nE.  Safeguards \n36.  Environment  (category  A).  A  consolidated  environmental  impact  assessment  and \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) covers all project components, complies with the PRC\u2019s \n                                                           \n23 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nregulatory requirements and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), and was disclosed on \nthe  ADB  website  on  1  April  2015.  Public  consultation  informed  the  project  design  and \nenvironmental impact assessment process, and will continue during project implementation. The \nEMP outlines potential impacts, mitigation and monitoring measures, institutional arrangements, \ntraining requirements, and implementation budget. The EMP implementation budget is 1.1% of \nthe total project budget. Capacity development and institutional strengthening are proposed to \nminimize environmental risks. Environmental complaints will be handled through a grievance \nredress mechanism. \n \n37.  Anticipated environmental impacts and risks are mostly modest and can be limited to an \nacceptable level through EMP implementation and compliance with loan covenants. The main \npotential impacts are on the water quality of rivers and noise and pollution impacts on sensitive \nreceptors within or close to the project road corridors. Trunk road G316 runs parallel to the north \nbank of the Shaanxi Han River wetland, triggering ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement for legally \nprotected areas. The responsible authority confirmed that the reserve within the project area of \ninfluence is designated for water quality objectives and there are no critical or valuable natural \nor modified habitats. The proposed EMP control measures are in line with the Shaanxi wetland \nprotection regulation and the collection of road runoff in sedimentation tanks will have benefits \nfor water quality, as runoff is currently unmanaged. Total carbon dioxide emissions from all \nproject roads are 79,000 tons per annum in the medium term (year 2023) and 112,000 tons per \nannum  in  the  long  term  (year  2031).  Economic  analysis  demonstrates  that  project  road \nimprovements will result in a net reduction of carbon emissions, although these savings are \nlikely to be offset by induced traffic and embodied carbon during construction. \n \n38.  Climate  change  (medium  risk).  A  climate  risk  and  vulnerability  analysis  study \ndetermined that there will be an increased risk of extreme rainfall events and flooding.24 A range \nof hard and soft climate change adaptation measures have been proposed for the project roads. \n \n39.  Involuntary resettlement (category  A). LAR impacts are attributable mainly to the \ntrunk road component. Measures to avoid or minimize displacement were considered in the \nproject design. Rural road improvement will result in minor LAR. The estimated permanent land \nacquisition for the project roads is 3,429 mu including dry farm land, garden land, forest land, \nhouse plots, and barren land.25 The total area of house and building demolition is 62,934 square \nmeters, involving residential houses and other structures. An estimated 12,527 persons in 3,341 \nrural households will be affected, including 3,013 households affected by land acquisition only \nand  328  households  by  both  land  acquisition  and  house  demolition.  LAR  impacts  are \nadequately assessed. Project roads are existing roads so land acquisition impacts do not cause \nsignificant land loss for affected households. The five resettlement plans prepared to address \nproject-related  LAR  impacts  are  adequate.  SPTD  has  previously  worked  on  ADB-financed \nprojects and has sufficient institutional capacity and commitment to manage social safeguards \nrisks emanating from LAR. Capacity building for the implementing agencies on social safeguard \nimplementation  is  integrated  in  the  project  design.  Project-affected  people  were  consulted \nduring resettlement plan preparation. Approved resettlement plans have been disclosed to the \naffected peoples and were posted on the ADB website on 18 May 2015. \n \n40.  The  LAR  cost  estimate  is  CNY189.50  million  including  land  compensation,  house \nrelocation,  livelihood  support,  taxes,  fees,  and  contingency  funds.  Compensation  was \n                                                           \n24 Project Climate Risk Assessment and Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 m2). \n ", "10 \ndetermined at replacement cost. The LAR budget is included in the overall project budget. \nSPTD  confirmed  adequate  LAR  counterpart  funding  will  be  made  available.  Resettlement \nimplementation will be monitored by an independent agency. A grievance-redress mechanism \nwill address affected people\u2019s concerns and ensure grievances are resolved in a timely manner. \n \n41.  Indigenous  peoples  (category  C). Han Chinese, the PRC\u2019s majority ethnic group, \ncomprise 99% of the project area population. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n42.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. 26  The  assessment  rated  overall \nimplementation  risk  as  medium  and  the  project  design  and  implementation  measures  are \nconsidered adequate to address the identified risks. The integrated benefits and impacts are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInexperience of implementing agencies  Training on the Asian Development Bank (ADB) environment, resettlement, \naccounting, disbursement, and financial reporting requirements and \nprocedures will first be delivered in the third quarter of 2015. \nProcurement delays  Training on ADB procurement policies and procedures will be provided in \nthe second half of 2015.

The government, Shaanxi provincial government, and SPTD have assured ADB that \nimplementation of the project shall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those \nconcerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the PAM and loan documents. The government, Shaanxi \nprovincial government, and SPTD have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \nwhich are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n44.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$200,000,000  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Shaanxi  Mountain  Road  Safety \nDemonstration Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term \nof 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements \npresented to the Board. \n \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n4 September 2015 \n                                                           \n26 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpacts the Project is Aligned with: \nRoad crash fatalities and serious injuries in southeast Shaanxi Province reduced (United Nations Decade of Action \nfor Road Safety, 2011-2020).a \nEfficient and safe all-weather accessibility in southeast Shaanxi Province provided (PRC Country Partnership \nStrategy, 2011 - 2015).b \n \n       \nPerformance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \nOutcome  a.
