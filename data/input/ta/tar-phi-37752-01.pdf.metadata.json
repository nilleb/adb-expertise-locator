To sustain progress achieved under the Power Sector Restructuring Program,1 the \nGovernment of the Republic of the Philippines requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide advisory technical assistance (TA) to strengthen the institutional capacity of the newly \nestablished Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) and facilitate the privatization of National \nPower Corporation (NPC). A Fact-Finding Mission that was conducted from 18 August to 21 \nSeptember 2004 reached an understanding with the Government on the TA objectives, \nscope, cost estimates, financing, and implementation arrangements.2  The TA framework is \nin Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  In the early 1990s, Luzon experienced severe power shortages, leading to prolonged \nblackouts  and  adverse  impacts  on  the  economy.  The  Asian  financial  crisis  in  1997\u20131998 \nsuppressed economic growth and reduced electricity demand, and NPC\u2019s debt service burden \nspiraled upward to unsustainable levels. To address these problems, the Government decided \nto restructure and privatize the electric power industry.  The blueprint for restructuring, the \nElectric Power Industry Reform Act (EPIRA), which Congress passed in June 2001, enables \nunbundling the power sector into generation, transmission, distribution and supply, and provides \nthe legal framework for sector restructuring and privatization of NPC. In accordance with EPIRA, \nthe Energy Regulatory Board was converted to a statutory regulatory body, ERC. The Power \nSector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation (PSALM) was created to oversee and \nmanage the privatization of NPC\u2019s generation assets (consisting of 41 plants with a total rated \ncapacity of about 7,000 MW), award the concession for National Transmission Corporation\u2019s \n(TRANSCO) transmission operations, and take over the debt liabilities of NPC.  \n \n3.  Since then, the Government proceeded with the privatization of NPC\u2019s generation and \ntransmission assets. As of early December 2004, the bidding for one major power plant of 600 \nMW (Masinloc Thermal Power Plant) and five minihydro power plants had been completed. \nSubsequent  to  two  unsuccessful  biddings  for  TRANSCO\u2019s  concession  in  2003,  bilateral \ndiscussions with interested bidders were initiated, but were terminated without conclusion in \nOctober 2004. Apart from unfavorable external factors that affected all emerging markets and \npolitical uncertainties associated with the elections, slower than expected progress was partly \ndue to perceived regulatory uncertainties related to ERC\u2019s institutional capacity and technical \nexpertise. Some of ERC\u2019s rulings proved to be vulnerable to court challenges, which were filed \non the basis of lack of strict compliance with rules and procedures set in relevant laws. Initial \ndiagnosis  undertaken  by  the  Fact-Finding  Mission  indicated  the  weakness  of  ERC  in  the \nfollowing  areas:  (i)  employees  are  unable  to  undertake  thorough  analysis  due  to  lack  of \nknowledge and skills in regulation and rate-setting methodologies, (ii) the document tracking \nand filing system is poor as business processes are not clearly defined, and (iii) staff are \ninexperienced in handling consumer complaints and dispute resolution. \n \n4.  The success of restructuring will depend to a major degree on the credibility of sector \nregulation. A strong, independent, and professional regulator working as a team to transform the \nelectric industry and balance the interests of all stakeholders is envisioned. The chairman and \nthe four commissioners of ERC are appointed by the President of the Philippines. ERC has 250 \nstaff  members  working  in  five  divisions:  Planning  and  Information,  Regulatory  Operations, \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1998. Loan to the Republic of the Philippines for the Power Sector Restructuring Program. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 15 October 2004.  ", "2 \nMarket Operations, Legal Service, and Finance and Administration. Given the wide range of \nERC\u2019s responsibilities and tasks, as well as their complexity and politically sensitive nature, \nERC\u2019s initial difficulties in rendering timely and technically sound decisions have not been \nsurprising. It is noted that ERC is making steady progress in fulfilling its mandate set by EPIRA. \nTo date, ERC has completed the requirements for open access by unbundling the rates of 133 \ndistribution utilities, removing intergrid cross subsidies in 2002, and starting to remove intra-grid \nand  interclass  cross  subsidies.  With  the  provisional  approval  of  the  increase  in  NPC\u2019s \ngeneration rate and removal of the cap on the cost of purchased power, ERC has balanced the \ndemands  of  customers  and  investors.  To  lighten  ERC\u2019s  regulatory  burden  and  make  its \ndecisions  more  predictable,  ERC\u2019s  responsibilities,  organization,  internal  administrative \nprocesses,  and  regulatory  procedures  need  to  be  reassessed.  On  the  basis  of  the \nreassessment,  appropriate  measures  will  have  to  be  taken  to  improve  the  efficiency  and \ntransparency  of  ERC's  decision-making  processes  and,  as  a  result,  the  consistency  and \npredictability of its decisions. The TA will help in this endeavor. \n \n5.  Power sector restructuring has reached a critical juncture. While the legal framework has \nbeen in place and the wholesale electricity spot market (WESM) is being established, the \nprogress has been slow in the privatization of generation and transmission assets. NPC\u2019s \ncontracts with independent power producers (IPPs), with take-or-pay provisions, need to be \nadministered in a way that is consistent with the competitive market. IPP administrators will \nhave  to  be  selected  though  a  competitive  bidding  process.  PSALM  has  also  to  conduct \nrevaluation of NPC generation assets which is needed to justify tariff increases prior to NPC\u2019s \nprivatization and encourage private investors to bid for these assets.3 As for the concession of \nTRANSCO, after the two rounds of unsuccessful bidding for the concession and termination of \nbilateral  discussions  with  interested  bidders,  PSALM  decided  to  launch  fresh  competitive \nbidding in the first half of 2005. A fair, transparent, and competitive bidding process will enhance \npotential  investors\u2019  confidence  in  the  privatization  process.  To  facilitate  and  speed  up  the \nprivatization process, PSALM\u2019s institutional capacity needs to be reinforced. The TA will draw \nlessons learned from the previous experience and international best practice to assist PSALM in \nundertaking its privatization mandate. \n \n6.  The TA is designed as an integral part of ADB\u2019s assistance to the Philippine power \nsector in accordance with the country strategy and program and will complement the following \nongoing operations: (i) TA for institutional strengthening of the DOE;4 (ii) TA for facilitating the \ntransition  to  WESM;5  and  (iii)  a  loan  to  establish  the  WESM  and  reinforce  transmission \nsystems.6 ADB has also managed a Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility grant 7 to \nassist ERC in dealing with regulatory issues affecting distribution utilities and rural electric \ncooperatives.   These  activities  have  been  closely  coordinated  with  those  of  other  funding \nagencies in the sector, particularly the United States Agency for International Development, \nwhich has also been assisting ERC in preparing regulatory guidelines.  \n                                                 \n3  On 22 June 2004, a joint NPC/PSALM petition was filed to ERC for a tariff increase of P1.87/kWh. However, on 4 \nSeptember 2004, the ERC gave only provisional approval for a P0.98/KWh tariff increase. One of the main reasons \nfor the reduced tariff increase was the lack of proper asset revaluation. \n4  ADB. 2003.

The goal of ADB\u2019s operation in the power sector is a financially sustainable, efficient, \nand secure power supply that arrests the drain on the Government\u2019s finances caused by the \npower sector, thus freeing up resources for the social sectors. The purpose of the TA is to gain \ninvestors  confidence  by  enhancing  ERC\u2019s  efficiency  and  independence,  and  provide  the \nnecessary financial and technical advice to PSALM for the privatization of NPC.  \n \n8.  The  Government  has  announced  a  new  timetable  for  privatizing  NPC\u2019s  generation \nassets and TRANSCO. The target is to privatize 70% of NPC\u2019s eligible generation capacity by \nthe end of 2005 and award TRANSCO\u2019s concession in the first half of 2005. Moreover, IPP \nadministrators will be selected to manage IPP liabilities in a competitive market. The TA will \nprovide necessary support to ERC and PSALM to facilitate and assist in the implementation of \nthe Government\u2019s ambitious program. The consultants\u2019 outputs will also help ADB to implement \na new Power Sector Development Program, which is currently being processed. By the end of \nTA implementation, the following main outputs are expected: \n \n(i)  ERC\u2019s  institutional  capacity  and  public  confidence  in  ERC\u2019s  impartiality  and \nindependence reinforced; and \n(ii)  Significant progress in privatizing NPC\u2019s eligible generation assets achieved, \nappointment  of  IPP  administrators  selected,  and  TRANSCO\u2019s  concession \nawarded. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will be implemented in two parts. Part A provides capacity building for ERC and \npart B provides advisory services to PSALM for privatization. \n   \n10.  For part A, the main task is to strengthen ERC\u2019s institutional capacity as a competent \nand efficient regulator. Specifically, the following activities will be undertaken: \n \n(i)  Institutional strengthening of ERC. Formulate and develop a strategic planning \nprocess;  strengthen  institutional  capacity  relative  to  organization  structure, \noperations, systems, program resources, and resource management (including \nfinancial,  technological,  human,  and  physical  resources),  internal  audit,  and \naccountability mechanisms; develop a code of ethics and professional conduct \nfor  the  entire  ERC;  strengthen  the  legal  competence  of  ERC;  strengthen \ntechnical competence and transparency in rate setting, adjustments, and tariff \ncalculations;  and  review  existing  budgetary  constraints  and  recommend  a \nmechanism for proper financial management and accountability. \n(ii)  Improving regulatory processes. Review, rationalize, and streamline current \nadministrative and regulatory rules of procedure for due process and automation \npurposes; complete drafting of all necessary rules of procedure, and codify all of \nERC's  rules  of  procedure;  develop  and  strengthen  the  consumer  complaints \nmechanism and the quasi-judicial grievance and dispute resolution mechanisms; \ndevelop and strengthen the mediation mechanism for disputes among market \nparticipants; and establish a \"case flow\" management and tracking system for the \nhandling of all regulatory and quasi-judicial processes. ", "4 \n(iii)  Improving  accountability  and  transparency  of  regulation.  Develop  a \ncomprehensive information plan to improve monitoring of regulated and non-\nregulated entities; propose an integrated information management system with \nthe  corresponding  business  models;  and  establish  rules for  and  monitor  the \npublication,  by  ERC  on  its  web  site,  of  the  full  text  of  the  applications  and \ndecisions as appropriate, including tariff adjustment, consumer complaints, and \nmarket player disputes. \n(iv)  Enhancing technical competence of ERC staff. Provide training in the newly \nintroduced performance-based regulation for setting transmission and distribution \ntariffs,  evaluation  of  utilities  performance  and  monitoring  of  compliance  with \nservice  standards,  monitoring  of  competitive  markets,  and  protection  of \nconsumers\u2019 and industry\u2019s interests; and develop staff operational manuals for \nimplementing  performance-based  rate  setting  and  market  monitoring  and \nsurveillance.  \n \n11.  The main purpose of part B is to provide a diagnosis of the main reasons for the limited \nsuccess in privatization to date and make recommendations on how to improve the process. \nSpecifically, the following activities will be undertaken: \n \n(i)  Draw  lessons  from  the  privatization  experience  of  the  last  3  years  and \nrecommend necessary adjustments in the methods, sequence, and timing of the \nprivatization process. \n(ii)  Assist  PSALM  in  assessing  necessary  generation  and  transmission  capital \nexpenditure during the transition period before the privatization of NPC\u2019s assets. \n(iii)  Assist PSALM in evaluating IPP contract liabilities, and bidding and selecting IPP \nadministrators  that will promote competition and minimize  PSALM\u2019s net liability. \n(iv)  Propose and design necessary credit enhancement schemes based on feedback \nfrom potential investors. \n(v)  Review NPC\u2019s existing records of assets, make appropriate updates/adjustments \nto the existing asset values, and make a field inventory of a representative \nnumber of high-value assets in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.  \n(vi)  Train  PSALM/NPC  personnel  to  familiarize  them  with  the  best  international \npractices of privatization and valuation methodology proposed to be adopted for \nNPC\u2019s generation assets. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,715,000 million equivalent, comprising foreign \nexchange  of  $1,085,000  and  local  currency  of  $630,000  equivalent.  The  Government  has \nrequested ADB to finance $1,200,000 equivalent covering the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$115,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis \nfrom the Japan Special Fund funded by the Government of Japan. The Government through \ntwo  Executing  Agencies  will  contribute  the  remaining  cost  in  kind,  including  office \naccommodation in Manila, counterpart staff time input, secretarial support, and workshops (see \nAppendix 2 for details of the cost estimates and financing plan). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  ERC will be the Executing Agency for part A of the TA and PSALM for part B. In close \ncollaboration  with  other  relevant  agencies  and  stakeholders,  ERC  and  PSALM  will  assign \ncounterpart staff to work with the consultants. ", "    5 \n \n14.  The TA will be carried out over 24 months starting in March 2005 for completion by \nFebruary 2007. Consultants' inputs will amount to about 57 person-months (37 international and \n20 domestic). Two consulting firms will be engaged for part A and part B of the TA, respectively, \nby ADB using the quality- and cost-based selection method (using simplified technical proposal \nformat) in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. For part A, the services \nof the consulting firm will be for 34 person-months (22 international and 12 domestic) over the \nfull period from March 2005 to February 2007. The team of international consultants (22 person- \nmonths) will comprise (i) a regulatory institutional expert/team leader (10), (ii) a regulatory-\nquasi-judicial processes expert (5), (iii) a utilities regulation and market monitoring expert (2), \nand (iv) an information technology (IT) expert (5). Domestic consultants will comprise one legal \nand regulatory specialist (6) and one IT/business process engineer (6) to assist the international \nconsultants. For part B, the services of the consulting firm will be for 23 persons-months (15 \ninternational, and 8 domestic) for 14 months, from March 2005 to April 2006. The team of \ninternational consultants will comprise (i) a privatization advisor/team leader (7), (ii) a financial \nadvisor (3), (iii) a technical advisor-power generation specialist (3), and (iv) a technical advisor-\npower transmission specialist (2). The domestic consultants will comprise accountants/asset \nvaluation specialists (8) to assist the international consultants. The detailed terms of reference \nfor the consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n15.  The  consultants  will  submit  short  monthly  progress  reports  summarizing  project \nactivities, issues, and constraints for the duration of the TA. In addition, four major reports \nwill be submitted: an inception report within 4 weeks from TA commencement, an interim report \non TA progress within 6 months, and a draft final report toward the end of the TA.  After \nreceiving the inception report, ADB will undertake an inception mission to discuss and agree \nwith the ERC, PSALM, and the consultants on the milestones of TA implementation. A TA \nreview mission will be fielded after the interim report is received to assess the progress of TA \nimplementation and make necessary adjustments. For each part of the TA, a tripartite meeting \namong  the  executing  agency,  consultants,  and  ADB  will  be  held  at  the  end  of  TA \nimplementation to discuss the consultants\u2019 draft final report. The final report will be prepared by \nthe consultants within 15 days.  \n  \n16.  All training materials developed by the consultants and office equipment purchased \nunder the TA will be transferred to ERC and PSALM upon completion of the TA, and thereafter \nwill remain the property of the Government.     \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n17.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,200,000  on  a  grant  basis  to  the  Government  of  the \nPhilippines for Institutional Strengthening of Energy Regulatory Commission and Privatization of \nNational Power Corporation.
