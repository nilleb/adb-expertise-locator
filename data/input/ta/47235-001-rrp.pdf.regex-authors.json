THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Trimmu and Panjnad Barrages Improvement Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will rehabilitate and upgrade the Trimmu and Panjnad barrages, which are \n80\u201390 years old, to (i) provide reliable irrigation water to 1.74 million hectares (ha) through six \nmain canals; (ii) primarily benefit 600,000 farming families (about 4.0 million people) in seven \ndistricts in Punjab; and (iii) help reduce risk of communities against floods (150,000 people), \ndroughts, and pressure on groundwater abstraction.2 The Trimmu barrage is on the Chenab \nRiver downstream of its confluence with the Jhelum River. Sedimentation has reduced the \nbarrage\u2019s flood passage capacity (FPC) by 30% from 18,265 cubic meters per second (m3/s) in \n1939 to 12,743 m3/s in 2013. The Panjnad barrage is also on the Chenab River, 250 kilometers \n(km) downstream from the Trimmu barrage. Aging, structural deterioration and instability, and \nlow FPC exposed these barrages to high risk of failure and resulted in unreliable irrigation \nsupplies and downstream flooding.3  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Irrigated agriculture on 8.4 million ha in Punjab (i) accounts for 28% of Punjab\u2019s gross \ndomestic product (GDP), (ii) employs 54% of the labor force, (iii) produces 90% of Punjab\u2019s \nagricultural output, and (iv) uses more than 90% of the water resources. Punjab\u2019s agricultural \nGDP is 66% of the national agricultural GDP. Of Punjab\u2019s population, 77% live in rural areas \nthat mainly depend on agriculture for livelihood and where the incidence of poverty is 30%\u2013\n35%.  Irrigated  agriculture  is  crucial  to  generating  higher  incomes  and  attaining  Punjab\u2019s \ntargeted 6%\u20137% growth rate (3% in 2011\u20132012). \n  \n4.  ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2009\u20132013 for Pakistan prioritizes improving the \nirrigation infrastructure.4 ADB\u2019s agriculture sector evaluation for Pakistan emphasized improving \nwater  resources  and  irrigation. 5  The  water  sector  road  map  identified  improving  the \ninfrastructure, institutions, and agricultural production to drive sustainable agricultural growth. \nPunjab\u2019s  Medium-Term  Development  Framework  (2012\u20132015)  estimates  an  investment \nrequirement of over $100 million per year for irrigation and allocates PRs9 billion ($90 million \nequivalent) for new irrigation projects.6 The country assistance program evaluation (CAPE), \n2002\u20132012 assessed Pakistan\u2019s agriculture and natural resource sector less than successful, \nbut it evaluated the program relevant in terms of its alignment with government and ADB \nstrategies.7 The CAPE rated the agriculture and natural resources program satisfactory for its \nstrategic positioning and the evaluation viewed as appropriate ADB\u2019s commitment to support \nPakistan in responding to the need to rehabilitate and expand the Indus River irrigation system. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The districts are Bahawalpur, Jhang, Lodhran, Multan, Muzaffargarh, Rahimyar Khan, and Vehari. \n3  The project was prepared under the multitranche financing facility for the Punjab Irrigated Agriculture Investment \nProgram; project preparatory technical assistance was not provided.  \n4  ADB. 2009.

Country Assistance Program Evaluation: Pakistan, 2002\u20132012. Manila.  ", "2 \nThe  recommendations  of  the  CAPE  regarding  agriculture,  natural  resources,  and  rural \n \ndevelopment sector have been incorporated in the project design. \n \n5.  In Punjab, the irrigation infrastructure has seriously deteriorated because of aging and \ndeferred  maintenance. Climate  variability  will  further  add  risks  by  changing  frequency  and \nintensity of extreme events such as flood and drought.8 The infrastructure has an estimated \nreplacement value of $20.0 billion,9 while the estimated cost to upgrade the system to modern \nstandards  is  $3.5  billion.  Barrages  constitute  the  most  strategic  component  of  the  large \ncontiguous irrigation systems. Their structural stability and effective operations are important for \nagricultural production and averting potential disaster during flood. Although groundwater has \nhelped against waterlogging and drought and has augmented unreliable canal water supplies, \nits overextraction in some areas  has caused saltwater intrusion and land degradation and \nincreased pumping and production costs. The Punjab Irrigation Department (PID) is working \nwith ADB, the World Bank, and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) to improve \nirrigated agriculture and related infrastructure.10 \n \n6.  Three tranches of ADB\u2019s $700 million multitranche financing facility (MFF) (2007\u20132017) \nfor the Punjab Irrigated Agriculture Investment Program have been supporting the upgrade of \nirrigation infrastructure serving 3 million ha, on-farm agriculture, and institutional reforms.11 All \nthe three tranches of the MFF have been approved and their implementation is on track. \nFollowing the approval of $73 million for tranche 3 on 13 December 2012, the balance MFF \namount of $129 million (equivalent) is not sufficient to finance the project. The proposed loan of \n$150 million was included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Pakistan, 2014\u20132016 \nas a firm loan for processing in 2014.12 The MFF will be closed by 30 September 2017. \n \n7.  The project is proposed as a stand-alone project loan as (i) required funding is not \navailable under the MFF, (ii) the project scope is limited to two barrages on the same river \nfacing similar problems, (iii) the project area is well defined, and (iv) the project implementation \nperiod will be relatively short (4\u20135 years). Detailed engineering design and approved PC-1 are \navailable.13 The project concept was discussed with the World Bank, the International Fund for \nAgricultural Development, and JICA. In March 2012, Punjab initiated the $423.5 million ($250 \nmillion loan) Punjab Irrigated Agriculture Productivity Improvement Program for on-farm water \nand agriculture management.14 The program (March 2012\u2013December 2018) covers the Trimmu \nand Panjnad barrages command areas and complements the project. \n                                                \n8  Ministry  of  Climate  Change.  2012.

The impact of the project will be sustained agricultural production in the command areas \nof the barrages. The outcome will be that the Trimmu and Panjnad barrages will be safe and will \ndeliver reliable irrigation water supplies to their canals. \n \nC.  Outputs \n9.  The  project  outputs  will  be  (i)  rehabilitated  and  upgraded  Trimmu  barrage,  (ii) \nrehabilitated and upgraded Panjnad barrage, and (iii) improved capacities of the communities \nand PID. The outputs will be achieved by (i) increasing the flood capacities of the Trimmu \nbarrage from 12,743 m3/s  in 2014 to 24,777 m3/s (94% increase), and of the Panjnad barrage \nfrom 19,822 m3/s in 1932 to 24,495 m3/s (25% increase); (ii) improving the stability of the \nexisting structures against floods, climate variability, erosion, and sedimentation; (iii) training the \ncommunities  and  PID  staff  in  flood  risk  management  and  integrated  water  resources \nmanagement; and (iv) providing social facilities such as a public park and an upgraded basic \nhealth  unit  and  a  girls\u2019  school.

ADB funds are expected to finance a proportion of works, social development, project \nmanagement,  capacity  building,  resettlement  cost  (excluding  cost  of  land  acquisition),  and \nvehicles and equipment less taxes and duties.17 The resettlement costs will be eligible for ADB \nfinancing only if they are incurred in compliance with all applicable requirements under ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009) and the ADB-approved resettlement plan. Financial charges \nduring implementation and works contract for the Trimmu barrage will be financed from both the \nOCR and the Asian Development Fund (ADF) loans. All other eligible expenses will be financed \nfrom the ADF loan as per the financing percentage set forth in the loan agreements, except for \nland acquisition and taxes and duties, which will be fully financed by the government. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The government of Punjab, through the PID, will be the executing agency. The PID has \nexperience of implementing projects financed by ADB, JICA, and the World Bank and has \nample technical, procurement, and managerial capacity to oversee these investments.18 The \ndepartment will have overall responsibility for implementation, reporting on both physical and \nfinancial progress, and assuming direct responsibility for barrage improvement works. The PID\u2019s \n                                                \n16 A maturity premium on repayment is not applied on the 20-year term and 5-year grace period following straight line \nrepayment procedure because the average loan maturity period remains less than 13 years. \n17 The cost of (i) works includes environment and climate change; (ii) social development includes family parks, \nschool and basic health unit; (iii) project management includes consulting services and PMO\u2019s operating cost; and \n(iv)  capacity  building  covers  training  of  communities/women  and  Punjab  Irrigation  Department  staff,  and \nstrengthening the Strategic Policy Review Unit and the Punjab Engineering Academy.  \n18 The PID has completed three World Bank-financed projects\u2014the Taunsa barrage rehabilitation project ($123 \nmillion); irrigation system rehabilitation project ($200 million); and a development policy loan supporting public \nfinance reforms, strengthening devolution and service delivery, and improving the fiduciary system ($100 million). \nThe PID is currently implementing the World Bank-financed Jinnah barrage ($145 million), JICA-financed Lower \nChenab Canal Improvement Project ($100 million), ADB-financed Lower Bari Doab Improvement Project ($228 \nmillion),  New  Khanki  Barrage  Project  ($270  million  equivalent),  and  Pakpattan  Canal  Suleimanki  Barrage \nImprovement Project ($73 million). \n ", "5 \nexisting  project  management  office  (PMO)  for  barrages  will  be  responsible  for  project \nimplementation. The PMO has established engineering, safeguards, procurement, and finance \nunits and has experience implementing four similar projects.19 Provision has been made for \nadditional staff, a construction supervision consultant in the role of engineer as defined by the \nInternational  Federation  of  Consulting  Engineers  (FIDIC),  and  a  management  support \nconsultant. A functional project steering committee and ADB\u2019s sound experience of working with \nthe PID will further ensure timely implementation. \n \n16.  Lessons from ongoing projects helped in packaging two main international competitive \nbidding  works  contracts,  advancing  detailed  design  and  bidding  process,  and  conducting \nmeaningful  consultation  with  potentially  affected  people.  An  experienced  international \nresettlement  expert  conducted  field  verification  and  reviewed  the  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement plan (LARP). The bidders evaluation and qualification criteria will be reviewed, a \nsite visit of the potential bidders will be arranged, and at least 90 days will be provided for bid \nsubmission.  \n  \n17.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n18.  The project is located on a transboundary river. The Indus Waters Treaty, 1960 allocates \nall waters from the Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab rivers to Pakistan. Therefore, no transboundary \nimpact on the project is foreseen. The project\u2019s technical viability and sustainability has been \nassessed as part of a due diligence exercise. The assessment indicates that (i) both barrages \nare running at a high risk of failure, (ii) their failure would affect 1.74 million ha of land and \ndeprive 600,000 farming families of irrigation water for several crop seasons in seven districts, \n(iii) the recovery cost will be high and time consuming, and (iv) the need to rehabilitate and \nupgrade these barrages is justified.20 Further, the project will minimize the flood risk to lives, \nproperties, and livelihood. The proposed interventions follow accepted international standards, \nwill ensure structural safety, and are technically proven and justified. \n \n19.  Barrage technology is well known in the region. The PID has 60 years of experience in \nthe operational management of 13 barrages serving 8.4 million ha. A team of around 200 \nengineers, technicians, and support staff manages the operations of the Trimmu and Panjnad \nbarrages.  The  barrage  manual  provides  guidance  on  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M) \nprocedures and practices. Annual O&M reports are prepared and appropriate actions are taken \nfollowing recommendations by the experts. The project will review the barrage manual for \nimproved management practices, including provision of special inspections every 5 years. The \noperations management of the barrages is technically and institutionally sustainable. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n20.  The main benefit will be sustained production as a result of improved barrages, as \nopposed  to  declining  production  and falling farm  income resulting from  either  catastrophic \nbarrage failure or continually decreasing reliability of irrigation deliveries as the barrages age \nfurther because of deferred rehabilitation. The other beneficiaries include residents (farming and \nnonfarming) in those areas subject to damage from either intentional or accidental breaching of \nthe flood bunds upstream of the barrages as increased safe flood passage capacities of the \nbarrages will significantly reduce the flood risk. \n \n21.  Economic viability. Economic analysis of the project yielded a mean economic internal \nrate of return (EIRR) of 23.4% (standard deviation 11.3%). The EIRR ranged from 6% to 65%, \nwith a 15% probability that the EIRR would be less than the 12% threshold. Individual analysis \nyielded a mean EIRR of 24.3% on the Trimmu barrage investment, and 21.9% on the Panjnad \nbarrage  investment.  Consumers  of agricultural  produce  are  a significant  beneficiary  of the \nproject, with 79% of the present value of benefits (PRs26,606 million), with producers assuming \nthe remaining benefits. The poor (PRs15,932 million) and extremely poor (PRs5,974 million) are \nprimary beneficiaries of the project benefits (83% of present value of benefits). Overall, the \nproject will have a positive impact on improving the welfare of poor people in Pakistan. \n \n22.  Financial sustainability. The government of Punjab allocates $1,057,790 annually for \nO&M of the Trimmu barrage and $847,352 for the Panjnad barrage.21 This allocation is based \n                                                \n20 The Trimmu barrage supplies irrigation water to the Haveli main line canal (146.4 m3/s), Taunsa-Sindhnai link canal \n(354.0 m3/s), and Rangpur canal (76.74 m3/s). The Panjnad barrage supplies irrigation water to the Panjnad \nAbbasia canal (220.0 m3/s), Abbasia canal (30.1 m3/s), and Abbasia link canal (158.6 m3/s). \n21 Actual allocation for O&M in Pakistan rupees was converted to US dollar equivalent using the 2 June 2014 \nexchange rate. \n ", "7 \non assessment conducted under the World Bank\u2019s development and policy loan in 2006, which \nwas updated twice (2010 and 2012). The next revision of the O&M funds is scheduled in 2015. \nThe government also provides additional funding for floods and emergency situations. Further, \nunder the project, a periodic inspection by independent experts is proposed, including review of \nO&M cost and removal of sediments every 5 years. The government will allocate funds for the \nproposed inspection and removal of sediments, if needed. One such inspection will be arranged \nunder the project during construction. Independent auditors audit the annual budget. Therefore, \nthe operations management of the barrages is financially sustainable. \n \nTable 4: Allocations and Expenditures for Operation and Maintenance of the Barrages \n($) \n    Actual Expenditures \nBarrage  Annual Allocation    FY2011      FY2012    FY2013 \nTrimmu barrage  1,057,790  1,217,562  974,752  896,229 \nPanjnad barrage  847,352  836,248  817,238  713,457 \nSource: Punjab Irrigation Department, Government of Punjab. \n \nC.  Governance \n23.  The  financial  management  assessment  concludes  that  the  PMO  has  satisfactory \nfinancial management capability to record financial transactions and balances, provide regular \nrecords  and  monitoring  reports,  and  safeguard  assets.  Financial  management  assessment \nidentifies two vacant staff positions and lack of internal audit arrangement under the PMO as the \nmain issues requiring attention. The related risks and mitigation measures have been included \nin the risk assessment and management plan. The PMO\u2019s financial management capacity will \nbe strengthened by providing additional staff and PID support in internal audit.  \n \n24.  Procurement of civil works and goods will be carried out in accordance with ADB's \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  while  engagement  of \nconsultants will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from \ntime to time). All civil works contracts valued at $10 million and above will be procured using \ninternational  competitive  bidding.  Consulting  services  will  be  recruited  in  one  package  for \nconstruction supervision using the quality- and cost-based selection method with a 90:10 ratio, \nincluding provision for management support consultants.22 One individual consultant will be \nrecruited for external monitoring of the safeguards. Because of different equipment and vehicle \ntypes  and  varying  procurement  times,  these  items  will  be  procured  through  six  shopping \ncontracts. All procurement and consultant recruitment will be undertaken by the procurement \nunit of the PMO in accordance with the project\u2019s procurement plan. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 11). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n25.  Approximately, 85% of the rural households are below the poverty line of $2 per day per \nperson as adopted by ADB, and at least 50% of the project benefits will reach these people. \nResidents around the barrages have suffered from increasingly frequent floods, specifically in \n2010 and in 1992, and the project will minimize the risk of further such events and associated \nloss of life, livestock, structures, crops, and livelihoods. The key poverty and social issues for \nthese people include limited livelihood opportunities, low skill levels, poor educational provision, \n                                                \n22 This method is used because with unique structures in rivers, quality is more important. \n ", "8 \nsubstandard health facilities, and lack of recreational options. The project will offer employment \nopportunities for unskilled and semiskilled workers. \n26.  The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. A gender action plan has \nbeen prepared, and key related actions include enhanced livelihood skills, better education, \nhealth  and  recreational facilities,  and reduced  travel  time  to  these facilities.23 Some  8,500 \nfamilies will benefit from the new health centers, post-primary school enrolment is expected to \ndouble, and 500 women will receive training in livelihood skills. These are significant advances \nin the context of southern Punjab, where indicators for health and education are particularly low. \n27.  There are some concerns about compliance with the core labor standards in Pakistan in \ncertain industries such as brick kilns. This issue was specifically raised with the Punjab Labor \nDepartment and the local branch of the Pakistan Workers\u2019 Federation. They noted that this area \nfalls within their remit for monitoring and compliance; however, they do not expect violations \nduring barrage rehabilitation. An effective judicial system, proactive civil society, and vibrant \nmedia provide protection against forced labor.24 Nevertheless, provisions for identifying any \nissues  will  be  included  in  the  monitoring  responsibilities  of  the  supervision  consultant\u2019s \nsafeguards team. The Punjab Labor Department and the Pakistan Workers\u2019 Federation will be \nnotified of any noncompliance issues for their action. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n28.  Environmental safeguard. The two subprojects\u2014Trimmu and Panjnad barrages\u2014have \nbeen categorized B for environment. Separate initial environmental examinations for the two \nsubprojects were prepared and disclosed on ADB website on 5 June 2014, as required by \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The Panjnad barrage subproject involves limited civil \nworks in a contained area without impacting the biodiversity. The environmental impacts will be \nlimited  to  the  construction  phase  and  can  be  addressed  through  implementation  of  the \nenvironmental  management  plan.  The  Trimmu  barrage  subproject  involves  slightly  more \nextensive civil works, which will encroach into the wetlands that have been created within the \narea of the guide banks. The barrage area is not a declared protected area. However, based on \na preliminary biodiversity scan, some of the species have been identified as sensitive according \nto the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species. Because \nof the contained civil works and limited scale of the project, direct impacts on biodiversity are not \nexpected and the mitigation measures designed for the activities will address all likely impacts. \nAs sensitive species have been reported in the area, a comprehensive biodiversity survey \nincluding large and small mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and vegetation was conducted by the \nWWF-Pakistan  to  assess  the  distribution  and  prevalence  of  these  species.  The \nrecommendations  of  the  biodiversity  report  have  been  integrated  into  the  final  initial \nenvironmental examination for the Trimmu barrage. The targeted mitigation measures will be \nincorporated in the site-specific environmental management plan, ensuring protection of the \nhabitat of these species during and after construction. This is an environmental enhancement \nfeature. \n \n29.  Social safeguard. The project is categorized A for involuntary resettlement and C for \nindigenous peoples safeguards. There are no indigenous peoples, as defined for operational \n                                                \n23 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Pakistan\u2019s Constitution regarding labor prohibits all forms of slavery, forced labor, and child labor (Article 11). \nDespite the constitutional protection, the International Labour Organization publications reflected bonded labor in \ncottage industries in Pakistan. \nhttp://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&context=forcedlabor \n ", "9 \npurposes by ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), in the project area. No private land is \nbeing impacted by the project, although 86 households comprising 548 persons squatting on \nstate barrage land will be either physically or significantly economically displaced. Social impact \nassessments  including  detailed  measurement  surveys  were  conducted  in  consultation  with \naffected  people  and  an  entitlement  matrix  and  a  resettlement  plan  were  prepared  by  the \nexecuting agency. Compensation for nonland assets is based on replacement cost principles, \nand  relocation  and  income  restoration  measures  adequately  enable  security  of  tenure  for \ndwellings and impacted business. The executing agency\u2019s environment and social safeguards \nunit exhibits a good level of proficiency in understanding the laws, rules, and procedures for \nland acquisition and resettlement-related tasks and ADB\u2019s social safeguards requirements. The \nexecuting agency has demonstrated institutional capacity to implement the land acquisition and \nresettlement plans through ongoing consecutive tranches of the MFF. The draft LARP, which \nwas approved by the executing agency, was disclosed in the project area and on the ADB \nwebsite  on  4  June  2014.  The  executing  agency  will  prepare  monitoring  reports  of  LARP \nimplementation  and  will  retain  a  qualified  and  experienced  external  expert  to  verify  the \nborrower\u2019s monitoring information. The verification reports will be disclosed on the internet. \n \n30.  Climate change. Future climate trends in Pakistan show an increase in temperature in \nthe range of 1.3\u00b0 C\u20131.5\u00b0C by the 2020s, 2.5\u00b0C\u20132.8\u00b0C by the 2050s, and 3.9\u00b0C\u20134.4\u00b0C by the \n2080s; this is similar to the 2.8\u00b0C\u20133.4\u00b0C increase in the average global surface temperature by \n2100. Projections on annual precipitation show a slight increase in summer and decrease in \nwinter but no significant changes in annual precipitation. Monsoon rain variability will increase \nand enhance the frequency and severity of extreme events such as floods and droughts.25 The \ncontributing flows to the Indus River system (Indus River 44%, Chenab River 19%, Jhelum \nRiver  16%,  Kabul  River  16%,  and  other  small  streams  5%)  will  be  affected  as  the  water \nresources in the system come from rainfall and snow and glacial melt from the Hindukush, \nKarakoram, and Himalaya mountain ranges. \n \n31.  The project will strengthen the existing structures against climate variability, erosion, and \nsedimentation and will increase their flood passage capacity significantly. The project will also \nbuild capacity of communities in flood risk management, making both the structures and the \ncommunities resilient to extreme events such as flood. The upstream structures reasonably \nbuffer the two barrages against high water and sediment flows. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n32.  The CAPE 2002\u20132012 identified (i) weak institutional capacity, (ii) lack of government \nsupport, (iii) complex and inappropriate project designs, (iv) insufficient project supervision, and \n(v) complex or unclear institutional arrangements as the most pervasive factors (footnote 6). \nMajor risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail in the \nrisk assessment and risk management plan.26  \n \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nExtreme events and flow variability:  The mitigation measures include \n(i)  climate-induced frequent floods and  (i)  the project design, which includes enhancing flood passage capacity \nreduction in river flows, and  of the two barrages and allocates funds; and \n(ii)  intersector competition for water  (ii) provision of water from the Jhelum and Indus rivers through the inter-\n                                                \n25 Planning Commission. 2010.

ASSURANCES \n33.  The government and PID have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n34.  The government and PID have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \nwhich are set forth in the loan agreements and project agreement. \n \n35.  Both loans will become effective on the same date upon completion of all the conditions \nto effectiveness. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n36.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n(i)  the loan of $50,000,000 to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Trimmu and \nPanjnad Barrages Improvement Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, \nwith  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 20 years, including a \ngrace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially \nin accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project agreements \npresented to the Board; and \n(ii)  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR64,982,000  to  the  Islamic \nRepublic of Pakistan for the Trimmu and Panjnad Barrages Improvement Project, \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at the rate of 2.0% \nper  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  thereafter;  for  a  term  of  25  years, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project \nagreements presented to the Board. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n1 September 2014 \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance Targets and Indicators with  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact      Assumption \nSustained agricultural  Average annual crop production of 10  PAD\u2019s CRS  Governments of \nproduction in the  tons/ha maintained, saving annual crop    Pakistan and \ncommand areas of the  losses, in Trimmu barrage area in 2024    Punjab continue to \nbarrages  (2014 baseline: 10 tons/ha)    give importance to \n    irrigated agriculture \nAverage annual crop production of 15  PAD\u2019s CRS  for food security \ntons/ha maintained, saving annual crop  and economic \nlosses, in Panjnad barrage area in 2024  growth in Punjab  \n(2014 baseline: 15 tons/ha) \nOutcome      Risk \nSafe Trimmu and  Trimmu barrage main irrigated area is  PAD\u2019s CRS  Climate-induced \nPanjnad barrages deliver  maintained at 1.08 million ha in 2021 (2014    reduction in river \nreliable irrigation water  baseline: 1.08 million ha)    flows and \nsupplies to their canals      intersector \nPanjnad barrage main irrigated area is  PAD\u2019s CRS  competition for \nmaintained at 0.66 million ha in 2021 (2014    adjudication of \nbaseline 0.66 million ha)    water could result in \n    reduced water \n    availability for \nirrigation \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
