INTRODUCTION \n \n1.   The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will strengthen the implementation \nof recommendations of the Midterm Review of Strategy 20201 of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB), the forthcoming Strategy 2030,2 and the achievement of the Sustainable Development \nGoals (SDGs). The support to developing member countries (DMCs) will include (i) developing \nADB investments in social protection; (ii) cultivating leadership and knowledge in social protection \nthrough cross-sector and thematic learning programs, policy dialogue, and a regional knowledge \nexchange platform for DMC representatives and development partners; and (iii) updating the \nSocial Protection Indicator (SPI) in Asia and the Pacific.3 \n \n2.   The TA was endorsed during the corporate priority framework meeting in October 2017 \nand is included in the approved 2018\u20132019 work plan of the Social Development Thematic Group \n(SDTG).4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  After the Asian financial crisis in 1997, social protection has become a key development \npriority for reducing poverty, vulnerability, and income inequality, as well as for promoting inclusive \ngrowth. The financial crisis of the 1990s led to an increased interest in social protection\u2014a trend \nthat continued as a result of the global financial crisis in 2008, rising energy and food prices, and \nheightened risk of climate-related disasters. These global challenges coincided with increased \nlevels of inequality both within and across countries, and greater constraints on governments to \nfinance social expenditure while grappling with the challenges of youth unemployment and aging \npopulations. \n \n4.  ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 (footnote 1) and the Social Protection Operational \nPlan, 2014\u20132016 (footnote 3) reconfirmed that social protection is an important instrument to \nreduce poverty and inequality and to improve the productive capacity of individuals, thereby \ncontributing to inclusive, equitable, resilient, and sustainable economic growth in Asia and the \nPacific.  Social protection is the third pillar of ADB\u2019s inclusive economic growth agenda, and the \nlack of access to effective and sustainable social protection systems is a contributing factor to \nvulnerability  in  the  region.  ADB\u2019s  forthcoming  Strategy  2030  (footnote  2)  underlines  the \nimportance of social protection and identifies it as a key component in the operational priority to \naddress remaining poverty and reduce inequalities. This is in line with the globally agreed SDGs, \nwhich have specific targets related to the expansion of social protection systems. \n \n5.  DMCs have taken steps to improve social protection programs, including expanding \ncoverage and benefit size, but these remain inadequate. The initial ADB study5 on financing social \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014.

Manila (ADB, in collaboration \nwith the International Labour Organization and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Korea \nPolicy Center, regularly updates the SPI for Asia and the Pacific. This updating of the SPI is part of ADB\u2019s \ncommitment to monitor social protection systems, as reflected in ADB. 2013. Social Protection Operational Plan, \n2014\u20132020. Manila). \n4  As part of the 2018\u20132019 work plans of thematic groups approved by the President on 12 March 2018. The TA first \nappeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 26 April 2018. \n5 ADB.  Asia\u2019s  Fiscal  Challenge:  Financing  the  Social  Protection  Agenda  for  the  Sustainable  Development \nGoals(forthcoming 2019). \n ", "2    \nprotection to achieve SDG targets 1.3 and 8.56 revealed large financing gaps and the need for \nDMCs to increase their budget allocations on average by 5% of gross domestic product (GDP) \nfor lower middle-income countries and by about 2% of GDP for upper middle-income countries to \nenable adequate social protection coverage and benefits. ADB\u2019s SPI has shown that DMCs spend \non average less than 3.6% of their GDP for social protection, compared to target expenditure \nlevels of 5.0%, to achieve the goals of basic social protection programs, including contributory \nsocial insurance (pension, health insurance, and other types of insurance) and noncontributory \nsocial assistance (cash and in-kind transfers), and active labor market programs such as targeted \ntechnical vocational programs and cash-for-work programs. \n \n6.  Financing constraints in DMCs are compounded by the fragmentation of social protection \nsystems across line agencies within the DMCs. Their capacity to design, implement, monitor, and \nevaluate social protection programs tends to be limited. DMC governments increasingly recognize \nthe need to improve the design and delivery of social protection to better target disadvantaged \nand marginalized groups. Innovations in social insurance, social assistance, and labor market \nprograms  are  emerging,  but  adequate  support  for  human  resources  and  accountability \nprocedures is lacking. \n \n7.  Monitoring and evaluation systems are also essential to provide information about how \nwell programs are working so that improvements can be made over time. To provide governments \nwith policy-relevant information on social protection systems, ADB and its partners (footnote 3) \ndeveloped the SPI in 2005 and will continue assessing social protection systems in Asia and \nPacific through the SPI which provides information on 38 countries in the region up to 2020 as \npart of the implementation of the Social Protection Operational Plan (footnote 3). \n \n8.  The SDTG has implemented TA programs to strengthen DMCs\u2019 capacity to monitor \ncountry expenditure and beneficiaries of social protection, assess the use of information and \ncommunication technology for delivering social assistance, and evaluate the financial gaps for \nexpanding  social  protection  to  achieve  the  SDGs.7 However,  financing,  capacity  building, \nadvocacy, and partnerships to support the development of social protection systems in DMCs are \nstill insufficient. These factors result in limited investments in social protection programs in the \nDMCs, leading to low social protection coverage and benefits across Asia and the Pacific, and \nthe persistence of poor and vulnerable populations, especially among women, in Asia and the \nPacific. \n \n9.  DMCs are at varying stages of improving and expanding their social protection systems \nand will require different types of support, including (i) financing existing and new programs; (ii) \nstrengthening organizational capacity on designing, implementing, and monitoring the programs \nusing new technology; and (iii) developing leadership capacity to manage complex programs. \nThere are opportunities for ADB to provide support for stand-alone social protection projects such \nas cash transfers, pension reform, health insurance, crop index insurance, and the improvement \nof labor market programs and policies. The social protection interventions could also be part of \n                                                \n6  SDG Target 1.3: Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, \nand by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable. SDG Target 8.5: By 2030, achieve full and \nproductive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with \ndisabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value. \n7 ADB. 2017.

Given the remaining challenges as well as opportunities with increasing DMC uptake of \nsocial protection, and lessons from previous TA projects implemented, the TA will aim to develop \nADB investments in social protection; cultivate leadership and knowledge in social protection; and \ncontinue to support the monitoring of social protection programming and spending in Asia and the \nPacific with the SPI. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.   Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: social protection coverage and benefits in \nAsia and the Pacific improved.8 The TA will have the following outcome: social protection \ninvestments in selected DMCs increased.9 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n12.  Output 1: Capacity to design, implement, expand, and monitor social protection \nprograms  improved.  The  TA  will  strengthen  the  Social  Protection  Operational  Plan \nimplementation and contribute to pipeline development by providing selected technical support \n(e.g., short-term consultants, mission support) to design and implement innovative and gender-\nresponsive social protection projects. The TA will provide resources to undertake advance \nanalysis on social protection issues and options in support of country partnership strategies and \ncountry operations business plans, and improve the design or support the implementation of \nsocial protection projects such as social transfers or projects with social protection components \nrelated to sectors such as education, finance, health, and public sector management.10 This \noutput will be closely coordinated with ADB\u2019s regional departments as well as ADB\u2019s sector and \nthematic groups.11 \n \n13.  Output 2: Knowledge sharing and partnerships on social protection strengthened.  \nThe TA will create knowledge solutions to improve the design and delivery of social protection, \nestablish partnerships,12 and foster cooperation among developing member countries. Strategic \npartnerships  are  critical  for  pursuing  policy  dialogue  with  DMCs  on  key  reforms  and  for \nstrengthening ADB\u2019s ability to provide the most appropriate solutions and to learn from partners\u2019 \nexperience. This output will aim to (i) establish a social protection network in Asia and the \nPacific,13 comprising think tanks, universities, the private sector, and other social protection \npractitioners in the region, and with the objectives of (a) developing and sharing knowledge, \nexperience, and evidence of impacts of programs, and (b) creating innovative social protection \n                                                \n8 United Nations. 2015.

The printing will be limited and upon demand. \n \n14.  Output 3: ADB\u2019s Social Protection Indicator updated. The TA will continue to support \nmonitoring and reporting on progress of social protection coverage and expenditure in Asia and \nthe Pacific through updating of the SPI.16 The SPI database and reports are a unique source of \nsocial protection statistics in the region. ADB will continue its collaboration with the International \nLabour Organization and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to \nproduce reports on monitoring the expenditure and beneficiaries of all types of social protection \nprograms, tracking both the poverty and gender dimensions at country and regional levels. The \nupdate of the SPI database and reports will also aim to support efforts to monitor progress against \nthe SDGs. Under this output, the following will be delivered: 38 SPI country reports, 2 regional \nSPI reports (one report each for Asia and the Pacific), and the update of the SPI database.17 The \nupdate of the SPI database in ADB\u2019s statistical database will be internally coordinated with the \nEconomic Research and Regional Cooperation Department and the Office of Information System \nand Technology. \n \nC.   Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix \n2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB will administer the TA. A team will be mobilized to promote strong synergy among \nsectors and themes and to support progress toward the SDGs. The team will comprise regional \ndepartments; SDTG members; other sector and thematic groups (e.g., education, health, finance, \ngender equity, and governance); the Digital Technology for Development Unit of the Sustainable \nDevelopment  and  Climate  Change  Department;  and  the  Results  Management  and  Aid \n                                                \n14 This will be implemented in collaboration with the ADB Institute and other development partners such as the \nOrganisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  and  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Internationale \nZusammenarbeit. Social Protection Leadership Program (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n3). \n15 ADB, in collaboration with its partners, successfully conducted Asia-Pacific Social Protection Week in 2016. There is \na high demand from development partners, think tanks, academia, and the private sector for ADB to continue hosting \nAsia-Pacific Social Protection Week. Asia-Pacific Social Protection Week (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 3). \n16 The TA intends to cover the same 38 countries that were covered under the Technical Assistance for Assessing and \nMonitoring Social Protection Programs in Asia and the Pacific (footnote 7) for the SPI update, subject to receiving \nno-objection letters from these countries (only 37 countries are reflected in the Knowledge and Support Technical \nAssistance at a Glance because of a limitation in ADB\u2019s eOperations to include Japan). The TA team leaders will \ndiscuss with DMC officials the counterpart support from their governments prior to implementation of activities in the \nDMCs. \n17 This will only primarily involve administrative data collection to update the SPI. Additional financing will be explored \nfor capacity building of selected DMCs in data design and collection in 2020.  \n ", "5 \n \nEffectiveness Division of the Strategy, Policy, and Review Department.
