INTRODUCTION\n1. The Government of India (the Government) requested the Asian Development Bank\n(ADB)  for  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  formulate  a  strategy  for  integrated  water\nresources management (IWRM) in the state of Madhya Pradesh (MP). A fact-finding mission\nvisited New Delhi and MP in May 2001 and reached an agreement on the TA objective, scope,\ncost estimates, financing plan, and implementation arrangements. These were defined through a\nconsultative process including central and MP state governments, external funding agencies,\nprivate sector, including nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and local stakeholders. The TA is\nincluded in ADB\u2019s 2001 program for India.1 The TA framework is attached as Appendix 1.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. MP remains one of the poorest states in India, with a per capita income of only about\n$180 in 1998.2 About 40 percent of the population of 59 million live below the poverty line. Along\nwith other poor states such as Bihar, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh, MP ranks extremely low\ncompared with other states in India for all indicators of the human development indices,3 such as\nper capita state domestic product, life expectancy, average years of schooling, literacy, and\ninfant  mortality  rates.  More  than  one  third  of  the  population  also  belong  to  socially  and\neconomically disadvantaged groups officially designated as scheduled tribes and scheduled\ncastes, whose rights and interests are protected under the constitution. With poverty reduction\nas its primary policy objective, the MP government has embarked on far-reaching policy reforms\nin the public sector encompassing fiscal management, governance, and decentralization, with\nthe support of the Public Resource Management Program loan and its related TA assisted by\nADB.4  High  priority  has  been  given  to  promoting  poverty  reduction  by  devolving  greater\nadministrative and financial authority to local governments and organizations.\n3. Poverty in MP is predominantly a rural phenomenon, with more than 80 percent of the\npoor living in rural areas, although the incidence of urban poverty is equally serious. Geography\nvaries  substantially  within  the  state;  poverty  is  highly  concentrated  in  the  eastern,  central\nnorthern, and far-western regions. District poverty and environmental status data5 indicate that\nlack of water resources and overexploitation of forest land and other watersheds has lowered\nland productivity, exacerbating poverty. The proportion of the poor is also substantially higher\namong the tribal population. Poverty also has gender dimensions; women bear a heavier burden\nin  terms  of  fetching  water  and  fuelwood,  and  grazing  livestock.  Under  the  circumstances,\nsustainable management of water and related natural resources with stakeholder participation\nand consideration of social and gender issues is one of the key challenges in poverty reduction\nand economic growth in MP.\n4. Of the 14 major river systems of India, MP constitutes the upper catchment of seven river\nsystems. With annual rainfall ranging from 800 millimeters (mm) to 1,600 mm from west to east,\nconcentrating in the brief monsoon, most watercourses naturally remain dry from January to\nJune. As a result, water availability depends critically on the extent of water storage from surface\n                  \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in May 2001.\n2  The per capita income includes the state of Chhattisgarh, which was bifurcated from MP in November 2000.\n3   Government of MP. 1998. The MP Human Development Report, Bhopal.\n4  Relevant ongoing programs include Loan 1717-IND: Madhya Pradesh Public Resource Management Program, for\n$250 million, approved on 14 December 1999; TA 3338-IND: Capacity Building of Public Enterprise Reform and\nSocial Safety Net in MP, for $0.600 million, approved on 14 December 1999; and TA 3423-IND: Environmental\nManagement at the State Level, for $3.620 million, approved on 1 March 2000.\n5  Government  of  MP.  1998.

While substantial efforts have been made to augment water\navailability by constructing reservoirs, this option has become increasingly difficult in recent\nyears,  due  to  rising  financial,  social,  and  environmental  costs.6  Increased  attention  is  now\nrequired to promote more efficient use of available water resources. In terms of water use,\nirrigation accounts for more than 90 percent, followed by domestic and industrial water use.\nWhile  agriculture,  the  largest  economic  sector  employing  80  percent  of  the  labor  force,  is\ndependent on the availability of irrigation most critically in the dry season, only about one third of\nthe  net  sown  area  of  15.1  million  hectares  (ha)  has  been  irrigated.  Competition  for  water\nresources within the agriculture sector is severe.\n5. The  irrigated  area  in  MP  has  increased  more  than  three-fold  since  1986  reaching\n5.4 million ha in 2000. This was mainly accomplished by expanding groundwater irrigation, with\nonly  a  modest  increase  in  surface  water  irrigation.7  However,  groundwater  exploitation  by\nirrigation has caused a widespread decline in the groundwater table across a large part of MP,\nleading to severe conflicts with the domestic water supply, which draws heavily on groundwater.\nOn the other hand, the performance of surface water irrigation schemes has been poor, with only\nabout half of the created irrigation potential utilized, due largely to insufficient operation and\nmaintenance (O&M). The urban and domestic water supply sector, while covering most of the\nhabitations through spot sources and piped water systems, faces similar problems. Furthermore,\nwater  quality  is  emerging  as  a  major  issue,  with  increasing  salinity  intrusion  and  high\nconcentration of fluoride in deeper aquifers in wide areas, deteriorating surface water quality due\nto untreated urban discharge, and growing incidence of waterborne diseases.\n6. MP also has large areas of degraded forest amounting to about half of the 8.6 million ha\nof forestland, and other degraded land reaching an additional 5.5 million ha categorized as\nbarren, fallow, and cultivable wasteland, out of the state\u2019s total land area of 30.8 million ha. The\nlarge area of degraded land in the catchment areas also has serious implications for water\nresources management, causing substantial siltation of reservoirs, watercourses, and irrigation\ncanals.  The  MP  government  has  been  actively  implementing  programs  for  joint  forest\nmanagement and participatory watershed management with delegation of greater authority to\nlocal institutions. While commendable progress is emerging,8 coordination of the water agencies\nand those responsible for the management of watershed land is lacking to ensure that integrated\nand strategic approaches are used to resolve this issue. Under these circumstances, promoting\nthe sustainability and efficiency of water use while addressing these cross-sectoral linkages and\nconcerns has become the major challenge facing the water resources sector. This requires\ncomprehensive as well as decentralized approaches to water resources management.\n7. Over the past years, interventions in water resources sector in MP have not been able to\ncope with these issues effectively. This has been generic across India. The Water Management\nSector Review (WMSR), a joint study by the central government and the World Bank completed\nin 1998, identified several shortcomings of interventions: (i) lack of a comprehensive water\nmanagement  perspective;  (ii)  predominance  of  supply-side  approaches  resulting  in  high\neconomic, social, and environmental costs; (iii) insufficient institutional arrangements leading to\ninadequate cost recovery and O&M funding affecting sustainability; and (iv) lack of cooperation\nbetween  states.  Recognizing  these  lessons,  the  WMSR  has  provided  guidance  to\n                  \n6  This issue is exemplified in large schemes implemented in the Narmada River basin by the state governments of\nMP  (Narmada  River  Development  Authority),  Gujarat,  and  Maharashtra,  which  have  drawn  concern  from\nproject-affected persons and NGOs because of resettlement problems and financial and environmental viability.\n7  As a result, the share of groundwater irrigation to total irrigated area has reached about 80 percent.\n8  In MP and Chhattisgarh (separated from MP in November 2000) combined, watershed program has covered about\n1.2 million ha of degraded land up to 1999. Village level joint forest management committee has been formed in one\nthird of the villages located in forest or forest fringe areas.", "3\ncomprehensive sector reforms for central and state governments. Accordingly, the Government\nis revising its 1987 National Water Policy, strengthening the cross-sectoral perspectives of water\nmanagement, and arrangements to sustain service delivery.\n8. Taking into account these initiatives, and in line with the state policy reforms for public\nresource management, the MP government is also preparing a state water policy (SWP). The\nSWP will set out policy objectives, principles, and institutional framework for IWRM on the basis\nof river basins, with emphasis on community participation, decentralization, conjunctive use of\nsurface and groundwater; coordination of competitive use; financial sustainability of O&M; and\nsound management of environmental and social issues. The MP government has also taken\nimportant steps to sustain service delivery of surface water irrigation systems by (i) enacting a\nparticipatory  irrigation  act  that  establishes  a  legal  basis  for  water  user  associations,  and\n(ii) rationalizing  irrigation  fees  and  organization  staffing.  These  were  implemented  by  2000,\nalthough the process to establish self-sustained irrigation management is constrained due to lack\nof funds to rehabilitate deteriorated infrastructure. Similarly, the preparation of draft legislation on\nthe use of groundwater has also been initiated.\n9. With this new policy direction, the need to define sound policy principles of the SWP, and\nto  develop  an  effective  strategy  and  action  plan  is  generally  recognized.  These  would\nencompass institutional arrangements and capacity development for IWRM and sustainable\nservice delivery, a legal and regulatory framework, and information base, while strengthening the\nparticipatory framework with due attention to social and gender concerns. These need to be\npromoted, while establishing sufficient awareness and support from sector institutions and civil\nsociety at large. ADB\u2019s water policy9 will provide effective guidance to these processes. Similarly,\nan investment strategy and priority interventions need to be formulated within this framework, to\neffectively implement the SWP while addressing poverty problems. Given the linkage between\nthe livelihood of the poor and effective management of water and related natural resources in\nMP, the output of the TA will also constitute one of the key elements of the MP government\u2019s\noverall strategies and actions toward its primary policy goal of poverty reduction.\nII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objective\n10. The overall objective of the TA is to contribute to the enhancement of sustainable growth\nand  poverty  reduction  in  MP  through  effective  management  of  water  and  related  natural\nresources  within  the  framework  of  IWRM.  The  immediate  objective  is  to  provide  a\ncomprehensive  strategy  and  action  plan  to  implement  IWRM  and  other  principles  in  the\nemerging  SWP.  The  output  will  set  out  a  sequence  of  actions  to  improve  the  enabling\nenvironment along with an investment strategy and a prioritized list of projects to achieve policy\ngoals. The output will also be used by the Government and interested funding sources including\nADB when designing projects relevant to IWRM.\nB.  Scope\n11. The  TA  will  cover  both  water  resource  management  and  service  delivery  functions,\nencompassing cross-sectoral and sustainability aspects of surface and groundwater resource\nmanagement, irrigation and drainage, urban and rural domestic water supply, industrial water\nuse, hydroelectricity, fishery, navigation, and catchment management. It will particularly address\n                  \n9 ADB. 2000. Water for All: The Water Policy of the Asian Development Bank.

The scope will include\n(i) identifying  action  agenda  by  preparing  a  comprehensive  sector  profile,  (ii)  assessing\ninstitutional options to address the identified action agenda, (iii) preparing a sectoral investment\nstrategy including a list of prioritized projects, and (iv) synthesizing the output into a IWRM\nstrategy  and  action  plan.  The  TA  will  utilize  available  data  and  materials,  and  follow  a\nparticipatory approach.\n12. Integrated  Water  Sector  Profile.  The  profile  will  be  prepared  for  the  state  and  a\nrepresentative river basin, using the standard ADB format based on available data and materials.\nThe activities will include (i) review of existing policy and institutional framework, status, and\nprojections for resource availability, use by subsectors, and quality; (ii) analysis of emerging\nsector challenges including areas of conflict; (iii) analysis of gaps and constraints between the\nrequired  and  existing  management  framework;  and  (iv)  identification  of  an  action  agenda,\nincluding  stakeholder  awareness,  institutional  arrangements,  legal  and  regulatory  base,\ninformation base, capacity development, and other subsector management issues.\n13. Institutional Options Assessment. This component, conducted simultaneously with the\nsectoral investment strategy study, will assist the analysis to establish the improved institutional\nframework of sector operations. The TA will identify and analyze options to address each of the\ninstitutional  action  agenda  items  defined  in  the  sector  profile,  covering  institutional  setup,\nfunctions, and coordination framework for sustainable water management and service delivery,\nlegal and regulatory base, and economic/financial incentive mechanisms. These options will form\nthe basis for defining an appropriate institutional strategy and action plan.\n14. Sectoral Investment Strategy. This component will help develop an appropriate sectoral\ninvestment strategy in support of the MP government\u2019s key principles of the emerging SWP and\nthe  overall  policy  goal  of  poverty  reduction10.  The  activities  will  include  (i)  sectoral  public\nexpenditure review to achieve sustainable O&M and prioritized investments; (ii) identification of\nmajor investment issues based on the sector profile; (iii) participatory appraisal of key water and\nrelated natural resource investment projects; (iv) development of priority criteria for selecting\neffective investments in the light of the MP government\u2019s policy goals and principles, with a focus\non those with a strong poverty focus with participatory and gender-sensitive approaches; and\n(v) preparation  of  a  ranked  list  of  recommended  projects,  for  possible  follow-on  project\npreparatory TA.\n15. IWRM Strategy and Action Plan. Based on the outcome of these activities, an IWRM\nstrategy and action plan will be synthesized, covering all relevant issues including institutional\nand investment aspects. These will provide medium-term direction for intervention decisions of\nthe Government in partnership with ADB and other interested financiers.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n16. The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $630,000  equivalent,  comprising  $290,000  in  foreign\nexchange and $340,000 equivalent in local currency. The entire foreign exchange cost and\n$210,000 equivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the\nGovernment  of  United  Kingdom.  The  Government  will  contribute  the  balance  of  the  local\ncurrency cost of $130,000 equivalent through the provision of counterpart staff, office space,\nadministrative services, and data. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are given in\nAppendix 2.\n                  \n10 The assessment will be primarily based on available project documents and evaluation reports.", "5\nD.

Institutional Options Assessment\n4. This component will assist the analysis for the establishment of an improved institutional\nframework of sector operations within the IWRM framework. The consultants will identify and\nanalyze  institutional  options  for  the  concerned  action  agenda  identified  in  the  IWSP,\nencompassing  institutional  setup,  functions,  and  coordination  framework  for  sustained\nmanagement  and  service  delivery,  legal  and  regulatory  framework,  and  economic/financial\nincentive mechanisms. This will be undertaken with intensive consultation with policy level staff\nin the TA steering committee. The outline of the specific activities, which will be further defined\nin detail in accordance with the identification of key institutional issues by the IWSP, will include\nthe following:\n(i) Analyze  agency  functions  and  legal  and  regulatory  framework  in  relation  to\ncurrent and emerging policy requirements; identify gaps and redundancies.\n(ii) Develop  options  to  address  the  identified  gaps  and  redundancies  regarding\ninstitutional structure of sector agencies and coordination framework.\n(iii) Develop options to address the identified gaps regarding legal and regulatory\nframework and economic/financial incentive mechanisms.\n(iv) Present options and recommendations to the MP government\u2019s working group\nand  steering  committee  to  facilitate  to  consider  action  appropriate  for  an\ninstitutional framework including legal and regulatory basis.\nC. Sectoral Investment Strategy\n5. This component comprises two subcomponents: (i) public expenditure management\nreview to analyze measures to prioritize and rationalize investment and O&M expenditure, and\n(ii) preparation of an appropriate investment strategy and a list of prioritized investment projects\n(including physical, institutional, human resource related, and other supporting interventions\nsuch as agricultural extension) to implement the emerging principles of the state water policy\n(SWP), thereby supporting the MP government\u2019s overall goal of poverty reduction (through\nincome  growth,  food  and  income  security  improvement,  empowerment,  and  improved\ngovernance  including  decentralization).  The  first  subcomponent  will  be  undertaken  with\nactivities to prepare the IWSP. The second subcomponent will be undertaken simultaneously\nwith an institutional options study, in a participatory manner through a series of meetings with\nstakeholders at river basin, district, and project levels. The output will be synthesized into an\ninvestment strategy and a list of prioritized projects.\n6. The  specific  activities  for  public  expenditure  management  review  will  include  the\nfollowing:\n(i) Review public expenditures (capital and recurrent outlays) for integrated water\nresources management.\n(ii) Review funding sources and arrangements.\n(iii) Review  budgetary  process  of  capital  and  recurrent  expenditure  including\nselection criteria of investment schemes.\n(iv) Assess  effectiveness,  efficiency,  sustainability,  and  transparency  of  public\nexpenditure program.\n(v) Recommend measures to rationalize and prioritize public expenditure, and to\nincrease revenues of sector institutions.", "12\nAppendix 3, page 4\n7. The specific activities for sectoral investment strategy will include the following:\n(i) Review relevant background information. Analyze major investment issues for\nintegrated water resources management.\n(ii) Identify key projects (physical, institutional, human resource related, and other\nsupporting interventions) corresponding to investment issues.1\n(iii) Assess sample projects in terms of effectiveness in improving integrated water\nresources management, reducing poverty, and operating key policy principles.\nSynthesize issues and lessons.\n(iv) Identify gaps and constraints in achieving intended sustainable benefits through\nidentified projects. Recommend necessary measures to attain objectives.\n(v) Assess specific options to improve the poverty reduction implications of selected\ninterventions.\n(vi) Develop priority criteria of selecting investment projects.\n(vii) Develop a list of priority investment projects based on the priority criteria, to be\ndesigned for possible finance by external funding agencies.\nD. Integrated Water Resources Management Strategy and Action Plan\n8. Based on the outcome of the institutional options assessments and investment strategy\nstudy, and in close communication and consultation with the MP government and interested\nexternal funding agencies, the consultants will synthesize an IWRM strategy and action plan for\nMP. These will provide medium-term direction for intervention decisions of the MP government\nin partnership with interested financiers including ADB. Activities will include the following:\n(i) Based on the activities in sections B and C, synthesize an appropriate IWRM\nstrategy.\n(ii) Develop an action plan to lay out sequence of time-bound actions/interventions\nthat may be appropriate for TA and project interventions funded by external\nfunding agencies including ADB. This should encompass policy and institutions,\nlegal and regulatory framework, information base, awareness of sector agencies\nand civil society, and investments to address priority IWRM issues.\n                  \n1 Inclusive  of  such  interventions  as  (i)  participatory  IWRM  planning  and  implementation  at  river  basins,\n(ii) interventions to improve water use efficiency of existing schemes including tank systems, (iii) information base\nfor river management, (iv) capacity development, and (v) micro water management."], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20010920152414", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Author": "ldm", "Creator": "ADOBEPS4.DRV Version 4.10", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R149-01TA", "ModDate": "D:20010924145234+08'00'"}}
