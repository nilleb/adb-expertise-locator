INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will help the Ministry of Environment \nand Tourism (MET) of Mongolia improve the management of hazardous chemicals by establishing \na comprehensive and dynamic web-based management information system (MIS) and building \nthe capacity of national agencies to use the system.1 \n \n2.  The TA supports the country partnership strategy for Mongolia, 2017\u20132020 of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and is listed in the country operations business plan, 2019\u20132021. It \nsupports ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030\u2019s operational priorities on environmental sustainability, livable cities, \nand strengthening governance and institutional capacity.2 The TA is aligned with Mongolia\u2019s National \nProgram for Reducing Air and Environmental Pollution, 2017\u20132025, which prioritizes environmental \npollution control.3 Addressing the management of hazardous chemicals also contributes to the \nSustainable Development Goals 3 (good health and well-being), 6 (clean water and sanitation), 11 \n(sustainable cities and communities), and 12 (responsible consumption and production).4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Chemicals  are  critical  to  manufacturing  pharmaceutical,  agricultural,  and  industrial \nproducts and help protect human health. However, the use and byproducts of many chemicals, \nand their discharge through air and water emissions and combustion processes, pose risks to \nhuman health and the environment. For many countries, including Mongolia, there is limited \nknowledge about the types and volumes of chemicals in use, especially hazardous chemicals. \nAddressing this issue is a global priority for chemicals management.5 \n \n4.  Most chemicals in Mongolia are imported due to limited capacity for domestic production. \nUntil 1990, chemicals were imported from the former Soviet Union. Since Mongolia\u2019s transition to \na market economy, key sources of chemical imports have expanded to include the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, the Republic of Korea, and the United States. About 260 agencies in Mongolia \nare currently registered to import chemicals and, since 2014, around 430,000 tons of 2,600 types \nof chemicals are estimated to have been imported, largely for commercial use.6 These include \nhazardous chemicals, such as mercury, cyanide, petroleum and crude oil (used in the mining \nindustry), bleaching and brighteners (for tanneries), battery acids (for vehicles), and coolants (for \nrefrigeration). Monitoring and reporting are a key step toward managing hazardous chemicals in \nMongolia but are hindered by two key issues. \n \n5.  First, no centralized MIS for hazardous chemicals exists. A range of national agencies \nrecord data on the import and use of hazardous chemicals, but data collection is not harmonized or \nconsistent. This limits the ability of the MET and other agencies to effectively monitor the import, \n                                                \n1  Hazardous chemicals are defined as any chemical with the potential to cause harm to humans, animals, or the \nenvironment, either by itself or through interaction with other factors.

Geneva. \n6  Importers of chemicals comprise companies for chemicals trade (37% of imported volume), blasting material \nproducers (32%), mining and petroleum (12%), construction (3%), agriculture (3%), wool and cashmere product \nmanufacturers (2%), and other agencies (11%). Unpublished data, MET. \n ", "2 \nuse, and disposal of hazardous chemicals and hinders interagency information exchange. This \nincreases the risk of unauthorized chemical imports that exceed approved quotas.7 Mongolia\u2019s Law \non Hazardous and Toxic Chemicals identifies the need for a national MIS for hazardous chemicals \nand mandates the MET to lead the monitoring of hazardous chemicals. To be effective, the design \nof such an MIS needs to be a web-based, dynamic system that is user-friendly, can be accessed \nby  key  agencies,  and  is  aligned  with  international  databases  for  monitoring  of  hazardous \nsubstances. The MET lacks the technological and financial resources to develop this database, \nwhich requires specialized skills in computer programming combined with chemicals expertise. \n \n6.  Second, government agencies responsible for monitoring hazardous chemicals have \nlimited capacity to identify, inspect, and manage chemicals. Other national agencies help the MET \nmonitor chemicals: the Mongolian Customs General Administration (inspecting goods at border \ncrossings),  General  Agency  for  Supervision  and  Inspection  (company  compliance  with \nregulations  for  the  safe  transport,  use,  and  disposal  of  chemicals),  National  Agency  for \nMeteorology and Environmental Monitoring (testing and analysis of chemical products), and the \nNational Emergency Management Agency (safety codes and procedures for chemical spills). \nThese agencies lack simple, portable equipment to help field personnel conduct on-the-spot \ndiagnoses for chemical products (e.g., at border crossings, work places, and disposal sites), \naccess reference information, and/or enter standardized data to a centralized database. \n \n7.  Supported by development partners and donors, especially organizations and programs \nof the United Nations and Global Environment Facility, the government has initiated steps to \naddress these issues. Under the National Council on Toxic and Hazardous Substances Affairs, a \nregulatory framework of laws, policies, and programs to manage hazardous chemicals has been \nestablished. Mongolia adopted the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling \nof Chemicals in 2009 and enacted a hazardous waste classification system in 2015.8 Mongolia is \nalso a signatory to international treaties and conventions for hazardous chemicals, and is a focal \ncountry for international efforts to address the unregulated use of chemicals such as mercury.9 \nReviews of national priorities for managing chemicals in Mongolia consistently emphasize the \nneed for an MIS on hazardous chemicals.10 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: environmental pollution from hazardous \nchemicals reduced and safer living environment ensured (footnote 3). The TA will have the \nfollowing outcome: monitoring of hazardous chemicals in Mongolia improved.11 \n                                                \n7  D. Naransukh and A. Frank. 2018.

Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Web-based MIS for hazardous chemicals established. This output will \ndesign and establish a national MIS to record and monitor the use of hazardous chemicals. The \nMET  will  be  responsible  for  the  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  the  MIS.  Other \nstakeholders\u2014including  government  agencies  for  monitoring,  enforcement,  and  research; \ncompanies registered to import and/or use hazardous chemicals; and the general public\u2014will \nhave regulated access to the MIS. The MIS will include an interactive system for data entry, \nstorage, use, and retrieval; recording of spatial data (e.g., locations of border crossings, transport \nroutes, and work sites where hazardous chemicals are used); automated \u201cred-flag\u201d warnings for \nspecific chemicals, volumes, and/or protocols (e.g., to alert border officials on the sensitivity of a \nshipment under inspection); user-friendly functions, forms, and web pages in Mongolian and \nEnglish, including drop-down menus to standardize data entry; automated queries and generation \nof summary statistics and reports; information and maps for public viewing; and a mobile \napplication for users to access the MIS in the field. Data will include an inventory of known \nchemicals used in Mongolia; import quotas and documented import volumes for hazardous \nchemicals; chemical licensing details for companies, including permitted import volumes and \nconditions for use; and real-time monitoring data, entered by officials (e.g., at border crossings \nand during site inspections), company personnel (to comply with license conditions), and the \ngeneral public (e.g., to report disposal of hazardous material).12 \n \n10.  The MIS will enable the MET to quickly generate and review information (e.g., to compare \nactual import volumes for a company against permitted volumes); provide timely information to \nthe National Council on Toxic and Hazardous Substances Affairs (e.g., to establish new quotas \nor bans on specific chemicals); improve data exchange with other stakeholders; and increase the \ntransparency of information provided to the general public. \n \n11.  Output  2:  Capacity  for  the  monitoring  of  hazardous  chemicals  improved.  The \neffectiveness of output 1 will depend on the provision of hardware necessary to operate the MIS; \nadequate technical capacity of staff tasked with O&M, data entry, and use of the MIS; and \ncontinued O&M of the MIS after the project. Output 2 will (i) identify and procure the hardware \nrequired to operate the MIS;13 (ii) identify the staff positions in the MET and other national \nagencies that will operate, maintain, and use the MIS, and prepare work tasks for the terms of \nreference of these positions; (iii) prepare an O&M manual for the MIS and hardware, including \nroles and responsibilities of agencies and staff positions, procedures for O&M and data entry and \nuse, and costs and funding sources for O&M of the MIS and hardware; (iv) conduct a capacity \nassessment  and  training  program  for  key  agencies  and  personnel  involved  in  chemicals \nmanagement, including procedures for O&M of the MIS and on-site reporting of hazardous \nchemicals; and (v) identify additional equipment beyond the scope of the TA that national \nagencies may require to improve the monitoring and reporting of hazardous chemicals, including \nestimated costs for purchase and operation, and potential funding sources. \n \n12.  Promoting innovation, knowledge, and value added by ADB assistance. The TA will \nestablish  Mongolia\u2019s first MIS  and mobile application  for monitoring hazardous chemicals: a \npowerful and innovative tool to help manage environmental pollution and support Mongolia\u2019s \nreporting responsibilities under international treaties. The TA complements the efforts of other \n                                                \n12 Data entry, including an inventory of chemicals used in Mongolia, will begin during TA implementation and be led \ninitially by the TA firm responsible for the design and piloting of the MIS, and a TA-funded information technology \nspecialist (section D). Handover of data entry tasks to the agencies that will be responsible for O&M of the MIS will \nbegin during TA implementation. Data will be sourced from digital and hard copy records. \n13 Anticipated to include servers, external hard drives, global positioning systems, and handheld tablets. \n ", "4 \ndevelopment partners and donors that are supporting chemicals management in Mongolia (footnote \n9), but which do not include the development of an MIS; and will be implemented in close \ncollaboration with other agencies to ensure alignment with other existing national databases. The \nTA modality is appropriate for delivering the MIS and reflects the added value of ADB support by \nfacilitating a tailored approach which integrates technology, chemicals knowledge, and capacity \nbuilding. The TA will apply best practice principles and standards for chemicals management and \nensure that the MIS is aligned with global databases such as the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations\u2013Japan Chemical Safety Database.14 The TA will assess the potential to apply high-level \ntechnology concepts such as artificial intelligence for MIS design and disseminate lessons learned \nfrom the TA through at least three workshops and a technical report. The TA also builds on a \ngrowing platform of government requested ADB support to strengthen the use of information \ntechnology and digital resources in Mongolia, including improved customs automation at border \ncrossings and two national databases under development for social services and state registries.15 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $770,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Japan Fund for Information and Communication Technology and administered by ADB. The \nkey expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. The following are ineligible expenditures: (i) purchase \nof vehicles, (ii) salaries for civil servants, (iii) foreign travel, (iv) scholarships or long internships, (v) \ndetailed engineering designs, (vi) civil works and other related expenses, and (vii) activities under \nADB\u2019s List of Ineligible Items (or Negative List) and Prohibited Investment Activities List.16  \n \n14.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of a steering committee to \ncoordinate TA project implementation, counterpart staff, internal coordination, and other in-kind \ncontributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will administer the TA and select, supervise, and evaluate consultants. The MET, \nacting through the Department of Green Development Policy and Strategic Planning, will be the \nexecuting agency for the TA. The department is implementing other ADB-funded projects and has \nadequate capacity to facilitate the TA implementation. Other agencies, development partners, \nand donors involved in the monitoring and/or use of hazardous chemicals in Mongolia will be \ninvited to participate in the TA workshops, meetings, and trainings. \n \n16.
