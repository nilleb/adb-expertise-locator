The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support strengthening of the \nSafeguard Policy Statement (SPS) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), with the goal of \nenhancing the effectiveness of ADB safeguard policies and their relevance to the changing needs \nof ADB borrowers and clients.1,2 The TA project will take into consideration the recommendations \nof the Independent Evaluation Department\u2019s (IED\u2019s) corporate evaluation of the effectiveness of \nthe  2009  SPS  in  achieving  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  objectives.3 The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  first \noperational priority of Strategy 2030 on addressing remaining poverty and inequality and the sixth \noperational priority on strengthening governance and institutional capacity in relation to upholding \nsafeguards.4  \n \n2.  The  TA  concept  was  endorsed  during  the  corporate  priority  framework  meeting  in \nNovember 2019 and is included in the 2020 Management-approved results-based work plan of \nthe Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department (SDCC).5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Addressing  lessons  from  the  corporate  evaluation  of ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement. ADB is undertaking a review and update of its SPS approved in 2009, following \ncompletion of the full evaluation of the SPS by IED in 2019.6 The IED 2019 corporate evaluation \nwas preceded by an operational review of the SPS in 2014 and 2016.7 IED\u2019s corporate evaluation \nof the SPS provided five main recommendations: (i) the SPS should be modernized based on its \nimplementation experience, and on updates of safeguard policies of other multilateral financial \ninstitutions (MFIs); (ii) a new and pragmatic approach should be adopted for the strengthening \nand use of country safeguard systems; (iii) a new safeguard implementation framework should \nbe introduced with strengthened oversight by SDCC and reporting lines; (iv) ADB to prepare more \ndetailed policy guidance and operational guidance notes for borrowers and clients; and (v) ADB\u2019s \nstaffing requirements to deliver the safeguard implementation framework need to be reassessed, \nand skills strengthened within operational departments and SDCC.  \n \n4.  Key issues covered by the IED corporate evaluation include: (i) the need for the SPS to \nbetter address social issues (e.g., labor and working conditions, community health and safety, \nstakeholder engagement); (ii) the extent to which topics covered by other ADB policies (e.g., \nclimate change, human rights, and gender) can be integrated into safeguards; (iii) harmonization \nof  safeguard  policies  and  application  with  other  MFIs;  and  (iv)  addressing  new  financing \nmodalities  in  the  emerging  investment  pipeline.  In  addition,  the  evaluation  recommended \n \n1  ADB. 2009. Safeguards Policy Statement.

Manila. \n5 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 3 August 2020. \n6 The SPS (para. 82) mandated a policy review by IED 5 years after becoming effective to assess its effectiveness in \nachieving ADB\u2019s objectives. The SPS has three overarching objectives: (i) avoidance of adverse impacts of ADB-\nsupported projects on the environment and affected people; (ii) minimizing, mitigating, and/or compensating for  \nadverse impacts where avoidance is not possible; and (iii) strengthening borrowers\u2019 or clients\u2019 safeguard systems \nand developing their capacity to manage environmental and social risks. \n7 IED. 2014.

Manila: ADB. \n ", "2 \nimproving clarity in delineating the roles and responsibilities of ADB and clients; striking a balance \nbetween front-loaded procedural requirements and implementation supervision; and aligning \nsafeguards to the needs of ADB\u2019s growing private sector operations. The IED evaluation also \nemphasized the need to enhance the oversight structure to achieve more consistent safeguard \noutcomes and maintain quality assurance across ADB\u2019s operations. Keeping in mind operational \nand  regional  differences  between  ADB  departments,  the  new  oversight  model  needs  to \nincorporate provisions for technical backstopping of safeguards staff and measures to avoid or \nmanage potential conflicts of interest.  \n \n5.  Ensuring relevance of safeguard policies with an evolving country context and ADB \nportfolio. Since the SPS (2009) was approved, ADB has made considerable effort to improve \nthe capacity of developing member countries (DMCs) and its clients to manage social and \nenvironmental risks. At the same time, the country context, development needs, and capacities \nof DMCs and clients have also evolved. From 2010 to 2018, the size of ADB\u2019s portfolio doubled, \nwith much of the growth occurring in two areas where client safeguard capacities tend to be weak: \n(i) private sector financing and (ii) support for infrastructure projects in the health and education \nsectors. ADB has also rolled out new lending modalities, such as policy-based loans, results-\nbased loans, and multitranche financing facilities, that require different approaches to assessing \nand managing safeguard risks. These shifts have led to a more diverse portfolio but have also \nresulted in more complex social and environmental risks. Shorter processing times have created \nadditional challenges in relation to safeguards. Furthermore, for the Strategy 2030 implementation \nperiod (2020\u20132030), there is a need to consider the suitability of existing safeguard policies for \nfragile and conflict-affected situations and small island developing states.8  \n \n6.  Need for harmonization of policies with other multilateral financial institutions. \nSince 2012, several MFIs, including the African Development Bank, the Asian Infrastructure \nInvestment Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the  Inter-American \nDevelopment Bank,  the International Finance Corporation, and the World Bank, have developed \nor updated their safeguard frameworks, while others have updates in progress.9 ADB\u2019s bilateral \npartners and cofinancers like Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, the Department of Foreign \nAffairs and Trade of the Australian Government, and Japan International Cooperation Agency \nhave also approved their safeguard policies. The safeguard policies of the different MFIs and \nbilateral  partners,  while  similar  with  respect  to  most  policy  principles,  differ  in  scope  and \nimplementation arrangements. In particular, recent updates to MFI safeguard frameworks more \nexplicitly consider emerging vulnerabilities such as sexual abuse, exploitation, and harassment. \nThey also give more consideration to thematic topics such as climate change mitigation and \nadaption, supply chain risks, and core labor standards and/or labor and working conditions. ADB \naddresses most of these topics holistically through the Operational Plans of Strategy 2030 and/or \nthrough specific thematic policies; some aspects of these topics are partly covered by the SPS \n(2009). To avoid fragmentation, a careful review of how these topics are incorporated into ADB \nprojects and monitoring systems is needed, with key findings from the review feeding into the \nrevised safeguard policy. \n \n7.  Ensuring an efficient and inclusive process of updating Safeguard Policy Statement.  \nAn inclusive, transparent consultative process will be adopted to solicit internal and external \n \n8  ADB. 2018.

The \nstakeholders to be consulted will include project-affected persons, indigenous peoples, civil \nsociety organizations (CSOs), government officials, and private sector representatives from both \nDMCs and non-DMCs to ensure that ADB incorporates different perspectives in its review of \nsafeguard policies. CSOs representing a broad range of issues and sector interests, and covering \nvaried demographic groups, will be consulted. Organizations representing groups that were \npreviously underrepresented in consultations, such as the elderly, disabled, sexual and gender \nminorities,  and  youth  will  be  included.  ADB  will  meaningfully  engage  community-based \norganizations from affected communities in the SPS review process. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: implementation of environment and social \nsafeguards in ADB projects improved.10 The TA will have the following outcome: governance \nframework in DMCs to uphold environment and social safeguards in ADB projects improved.11, 12 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n \n9.  Output 1: Asian Development Banks\u2019s safeguard policies strengthened. The TA will \nsupport analytical studies to identify strategies for improving elements of the SPS. The studies \nwill build on the IED evaluation of the SPS; inputs from ADB staff; consultations with internal and \nexternal stakeholders, including ADB clients; affected people; CSOs, and MFI partners. The \nstudies will draw lessons from MFIs that have recently updated their safeguard policies and will \nbuild on the outputs of related ADB TA projects.13 Findings from the analytical studies will be used \nto inform deliberations on the merits of feasible options for each element of the revised safeguards \npolicy. \n  \n10.  Revised safeguard policy architecture. The current SPS policy architecture comprises \nan  overarching  statement  of  ADB\u2019s  commitment  to  ensuring  the  social  and  environmental \nsustainability of its projects and safeguard policy principles; and descriptions of the policy delivery \nprocess, roles and responsibilities, and requirements for borrowers and/or clients. The TA will \nsupport a comprehensive study to assess the pros and cons of the two forms of safeguard policy \narchitecture:  the  \u201cAsian  model\u201d,  an  integrated  principle-based  policy  (e.g.  ADB,  Asian \nInfrastructure Investment Bank); and the performance-standard model (e.g., European Bank for \nReconstruction and Development, International Finance Corporation, World Bank). The study will \nreview the experiences of MFIs that have recently updated their safeguard frameworks using the \nperformance-standard  model.  The  study  recommendations  will  be  used  to  develop  the \narchitecture of the revised safeguards policy.   \n \n11.  Improving safeguard classification. The TA will support a study that will review how \nother MFIs approach safeguards classification, in comparison to ADB\u2019s practice. ADB undertakes \nproject level safeguards categorization separately across environment; involuntary resettlement \nand indigenous peoples followed by separate due diligence requirements for each. Due to this \nfragmented approach the inter relationships between the three safeguards are either not always \n \n10  See footnote 8. \n11  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n12  ADB will obtain a no-objection in writing from the relevant DMC prior to conducting or financing TA activities on the \nterritory of such DMC. \n13  ADB. 2019.

Most \nMFIs recognize the interrelationship between environmental and social risks and have developed \nintegrated systems for safeguard categorization. This study will provide recommendations for \nrevising ADBs project safeguards categorization system to address all environmental and social \nimpacts and risks, and synergies between them. \n \n12.  Background papers on safeguard topics The TA, will review the existing safeguards \npolicy provisions for environment, involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples, with an \nemphasis on improved guidance on specialized topics such as: biodiversity; noise and vibration; \npollution prevention; community health and safety; cultural heritage; voluntary land donation; \nstakeholder engagement and consultation; grievance redress mechanisms; and treatment of \nvulnerable groups. The TA will also study and take a closer look at thematic, cross cutting topics \nand  emerging  issues  which  are  explicitly  covered  by  other MFIs  in  their  recently  updated \nsafeguards frameworks. These include: labor and working conditions; primary supply chain risks; \ngender diversity and inclusion; sexual abuse, exploitation, and harassment; climate change; \nissues pertaining to fragile and conflict-affected situations and small island developing states; and \nprotection  of  human  rights  defenders.  The  consultants  hired  through  the  TA  will  prepare \nbackground papers based on the topics studied. The findings will assist ADB in considering the \nextent to which these aspects can be integrated into the revised safeguards policy.   \n \n13.  Policy  directions  for  country  safeguards  systems.  The  TA  will  assess  the \neffectiveness of ADB\u2019s past efforts in strengthening and using country safeguards systems (CSS). \nSince 2009, ADB has approved close to $50 million of TA to support DMCs with assessing legal \nand  policy  gaps;  preparing  guidance  on  good  practices; conducting capacity  building;  and \ndeveloping regional learning centers on safeguards. However, it is recognized that the use of \nCSS, which is included in the current SPS as a possible modality, has had limited uptake. \nRegarding the use of CSS, the TA team will recommend more pragmatic approaches for using \nCSS in ADB projects through a range of lending modalities. The results-based lending modality \ncould be used as a programmatic tool to incrementally strengthen system capacities across a \nsector. Other possible modalities for CSS integration and strengthening include sector lending \nand multitranche financing facilities, which provide opportunities for longer-term engagement. The \nTA team will also revisit the current approach to equivalence and acceptability assessments, \nconsidering lessons from other MFIs that have recently updated their safeguard policies. Efforts \nwill be coordinated with the Joint Regional Community of Practice on Safeguards.14  \n \n14.  Safeguards for new financing instruments and new modalities. Since 2009, new \nlending modalities have emerged that are becoming popular because of their flexibility. These \ninclude but are not limited to results-based lending, policy-based lending, financial intermediaries, \ngeneral corporate finance, and equity financing. The TA will support an analytical study to \nstrengthen and design better-tailored safeguard provisions for a range of financing instruments. \nThe experience and approach of other MFIs will again be drawn upon.  \n \n15.  Output 2: Safeguard procedures streamlined, and requirements improved. Based on \nthe findings, lessons learned, and recommendations from Output 1, policy procedures will be \nupdated and streamlined. This will include the preparation of guidance notes for implementing the \npolicy provisions for safeguards due diligence. Relevant templates and systems will also be \n \n14 The Joint Regional Community of Practice on Safeguards was established in 2012 by ADB, Department of Foreign \nAffairs and Trade of the Australian Government, Japan International Cooperation Agency and the World Bank.  The \nCommunity of Practice functions as a coordinating body for the developing Partners\u2019 response to needs of DMCs in \nstrengthening CSS, and clearly state the goal of bringing country safeguards to international good practice standards \nas well as ensuring alignment of Partner\u2019s procedures on CSS. \n ", "5 \nreviewed and revised to reflect the new policy provisions, and to streamline the procedures. \nFurthermore, staff instructions and operations manuals for policy implementation will also be \nprepared using internal resources. Additionally, the safeguards oversight framework will also be \nstrengthened.15  \n \n16.  Revised safeguard procedures and requirements. The TA will further develop and \ndetail the procedural elements needed for the implementation of the revised safeguards policy.  \nThe TA will review and provide greater clarity for borrowers and clients on their requirements for \nsafeguard screening, categorization of safeguards, environmental and social impact assessments, \nstakeholder engagement, and disclosure, as well as additional requirements for different lending \nmodalities,  through  revised  operations  manuals,  staff  instructions,  and  technical  guidance \nmaterials.  Procedural  aspects  of  MFI\u2019s  accountability  and  safeguard  implementation  and \nmonitoring of non-sovereign operations, especially financial intermediary, general corporate and \nequity financing will be included. The role of ADB, including SDCC, and operations departments \nin monitoring and supervision safeguards implementation in projects will be clarified.  \n \n17.  Revised  safeguard  policy.  Building  on  output  1, feedback from  consultations  with \nstakeholders, and recommendations of the technical working groups (TWGs), a consultation \npaper on the draft revised safeguard policy will be prepared. The draft paper will be made \navailable for external consultations and will be further revised based on feedback. The policy \npaper will include but not be limited to coverage of (i) safeguard policy objectives and scope; (ii) \ndetailed  safeguards  policy  requirements  for  borrowers  and  clients;  and  (iii)  roles  and \nresponsibilities of ADB and its borrowers and clients. The final policy paper will be submitted for \nBoard approval. \n \n18.  Enhanced oversight framework for safeguards. The TA will support an analysis to \nprovide recommendations on safeguards implementation oversight in ADB. The analysis will \ncover institutional arrangements, staffing, and resources required to implement the revised \nsafeguard policies. The analysis will look into (i) how the role of SDCC that can be strengthened \nas the central department for oversight, policy interpretation, problem solving, and capacity \nbuilding; (ii) how the structure and reporting lines in operations departments can be streamlined \nto achieve greater consistency in safeguard outcomes; (iii) the staff complement required to \ndeliver the revised safeguard policies; and (iv) further skills enhancement needs for safeguards \nstaff. Consultations with and feedback from ADB operations departments will inform the analysis. \n \n19.  Output 3: Stakeholder engagement plan implemented. ADB will prepare a three-phase \nstakeholder engagement plan which will include information sharing and soliciting stakeholder \nfeedback and comments throughout the policy revision process. In the first phase, ADB will launch \nthe safeguard policy review, share the consultation and communications plan, and lead a first \nround of external consultations to discuss the stakeholder consultation plan. The plan aims to \nunderstand what stakeholders, including niche stakeholders and women, perceive to be the main \nissues requiring attention during the safeguards policy review. The second phase, during which \nADB  will  triangulate  the  information  collected  through  studies  it  commissioned  with  other \nstakeholders,  will  focus  on  discussions  around  multiple  proposed  options  for  the  revised \nsafeguards policy. The third and final phase will look at outstanding issues and areas where ADB \nneeds additional information and will include soliciting comments on the draft revised safeguard \npolicy. The TA will support the participation of under-represented stakeholders, independent \nfacilitators, communication and meeting costs, and translation of relevant documents into selected \nlocal languages. Consultation materials, as well as means to submit comments and ADB\u2019s \n \n15 Corporate documents will be prepared using ADB internal administrative budget.  \n ", "6 \nresponses, will all be available on the ADB website. In the context of the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19)  pandemic,  appropriate  measures  will  be  implemented  to  safely  engage  with \nstakeholders. \n \n20.  Output  4:  Preparatory  measures  for  roll-out  of  the  revised  safeguard  policy \ncompleted. A capacity building program will be designed to support borrowers and clients in \nimplementing ADB\u2019s revised safeguards policy. The plan will include (i) general information and \nawareness raising materials; (ii) training materials and e-learning modules corresponding to the \npolicy principles and requirements (incorporating gender diversity and inclusion); (iii) technical \nguidance on specific policy implementation issues and standards; and (iv) long-term capacity \ndevelopment plan. This will be prepared to guide roll-out within ADB as well as for borrowers and \nclients. The capacity building program will be implemented under a TA that will be processed after \nthe safeguard policy update.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n21.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund ($1,000,000 from TASF-6 and $1,000,000 from TASF-other \nsources). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  ADB will administer the TA through SDCC with the support of safeguards staff from the \noperations departments, relevant sector and thematic groups, and non-operations departments. \nThe TA will establish a high level interdepartmental steering committee chaired by the director \ngeneral, concurrently chief compliance officer, SDCC and comprising the relevant heads of \ndepartments to provide overall guidance to the process of updating ADB\u2019s safeguard policies. A \nLead Coordination Group16 will be established to lead the SPS update process, oversee the \npreparation of the draft and final revised safeguard policy paper. TWGs will be established to \ncoordinate and advise the studies on various aspect aspects of the safeguard policy review.17  \nThe Lead Coordination Group will also provide technical support and advice to the TWGs. \n \n23.
