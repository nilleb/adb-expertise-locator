The Government of Sri Lanka has been supporting reforms in the public sector utilities to \n(i) improve the performance and financial sustainability of service providers and the quality of \nservices to consumers; and (ii) provide an enabling institutional, legal, and regulatory framework \nfor private sector participation (PSP). The  Asian Development Bank (ADB) has assisted with \nformulating and implementing these reforms in its work in the sector, especially in establishing \nan independent regulator for water supply and sanitation (WSS) sector. In October 2002, the \nParliament  passed  the  Public  Utilities  Commission  (PUC)  Act  to  provide  an  institutional \nframework for regulating the power sector, WSS sector, and eventually the transportation \nsector. Each sector will develop specific regulations. \n \n2.   The Government has requested ADB to provide advisory technical assistance (TA) to \ndevelop the regulations and guidelines for the WSS sector within the existing PUC framework. \nADB fielded a TA Fact-Finding Mission to Sri Lanka in September 2002 to formulate the TA.1 \nDiscussions were held with representatives from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of \nHousing and Plantation Infrastructure (MH&PI), the Public Interest Program Unit, the Water \nSector Reform (WSR) Unit, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board, and the World \nBank. The objectives, scope, cost estimates, financing plan, and implementation arrangements \nare  the  result  of  the  understanding  reached  during  the  Mission.  The  TA  framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  In its poverty reduction strategy, the Government states that \"the provision of safe \ndrinking water, and adequate sewage and sanitation systems, is frequently cited as the single, \nhighest social service priority by poor households\u201d2 and it identifies access to safe water and \nappropriate sanitation as one of its priorities. Although provision for WSS in Sri Lanka has been \na  priority,  the  requirements  for  potable  drinking  water  and  sanitation  have  exceeded  the \nGovernment's institutional and financial capacity. At present, piped water service is available to \nonly  29%  of  the  population,  mostly  in  urban  areas.  The  Government  estimates  that  the \ninvestment requirements in the water sector will be as much as SLRs12 billion a year to meet \nthe demand for piped water supply by the year 2010.  \n \n4.  At present, the Government is supporting sector reforms to improve its capacity to \nprovide for new investments and improve the operation and maintenance of existing ones.3 The \nmain problems to be addressed are low self-financing ratios, poor asset management, and high \nproduction  costs.  The  underlying  causes  of  the  problems  are  the  lack  of  appropriate \nperformance targets, lack of independent tariff setting, inefficient cross-subsidy structure, and \novercentralized  service  delivery.  Addressing  these  issues  requires  revising  the  existing \ninstitutional and legal framework and instituting the following sector reforms: (i) introduce PSP; \n(ii) improve operational, managerial, and commercial practices of the public utility; (iii) support \n                                                 \n1\n  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in April 2002.  \n2\n  ADB. 2002. Sri Lanka: Connecting to Growth: Sri Lanka's Poverty Reduction Strategy. Manila. \n3\n   Among these reforms is the development of a policy for managing water resources. In March 2002, the Cabinet \napproved a national water policy; however, due to adverse public reaction to some aspects, the policy is being \nreviewed. The enactment of the Water Act is now scheduled in June 2003 to provide  more time for public \nconsultations. The Ministry of Housing and Plantation Infrastructure does not have authority over water resource \nissues, and will only regulate water supply and sanitation. Currently, use and management of sources of drinking \nwater is approved on a case-to-case basis.  Eventually, providers of drinking water will follow the provisions of the \nnational water policy.  \n ", " 2\ndecentralization of services; and (iv) establish independent regulation. The latter will set the \nlegal and institutional framework for the rest of the reforms. \n \n5.  To date, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board has been responsible for water \nsupply; it has acted as owner, operator, and regulator. The inherent conflict of interest requires \nthat the roles be separated. The provision of urban piped water supply contains significant \nmonopoly elements. Monopoly of supply is not an effective mechanism to provide efficient \nservices at competitive prices. In this context, political agendas can provide disincentives for \ncost recovery and efficiency improvements. For the private sector, high political and regulatory \nrisks translate into high transaction costs. To mitigate these risks and to counteract monopoly \npower, regulatory mechanisms and regulators need to be in place. Taking into consideration \ninvestments in the sector, regulators will rule on policy issues of service coverage, price, service \nquality, performance standards, operator incentives, as well as penalties in case of violation of \nstandards. When competition is not feasible, regulating the price and quality of service is \nrelevant to public and private water supply companies alike to balance the interests of suppliers \nand consumers. \n \n6.  The role of the Government is to formulate and articulate policies that are binding on the \nsector regulator and to act on regulatory decisions. Considerable government commitment is \nrequired to raise tariffs to cover costs, and to build regulatory arrangements that give public and \nprivate water supply companies confidence that they will be able to receive an adequate rate of \nreturn on their investments. At the same time, price reviews are needed to ensure that profits \nare not excessively high. Unexpected changes in the operating or financial environment will \nmake it necessary for the regulator to adjust prices and performance standards from time to \ntime. Good mechanisms not only protect consumers from high prices and low-quality service, \nbut also safeguard the legitimate interests of water enterprises to earn a reasonable profit from \ntheir investments. \n \n7.  An effective regulatory framework will facilitate affordable delivery of adequate and safe \nwater to consumers, especially the poor. Pricing rules try to balance the incentives to use water \nefficiently and social concerns such as quality of water supply, universal service goals, and \nsubsidy schemes for the poor. Since the regulator has a counter monopoly to the water \nenterprises, power needs to be carefully defined to guard against the regulator's abusing it and \nfavoring governments or exploiting the customers or investors. Regulations must be set up to be \nable to resist improper influence from any of the different interest groups. A big challenge to \ngood regulation is the generation of information that allows the regulators to establish good \nrules and allows the interest groups to watch out for improprieties by the regulator. The best \nway to generate information is to introduce multiple players in the water supply sector in ways \nthat enhance direct or indirect competition, for example, through benchmarking.  \n \n8.  ADB has consistently supported the establishment of an independent regulator for the \nWSS sector through its loans to the sector and the subject TA. In July 2000, ADB assisted the \nGovernment  in  preparing  a  draft  act  for  establishing  the  Water  Services  Regulatory \nCommission.4 The draft outlines the requirements for establishing an independent regulatory \nbody for the water sector in Sri Lanka and provides expert advice on the implications of the \ndifferent institutional frameworks. This work provided a platform for discussion and a set of \ndocuments to serve as reference for the developing regulations in the water sector, but the \ncommission was not established because the Government opted for a multisector regulator. \n                                                 \n4\n  ADB. 1997. Report and Recommendation to the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to Sri \nLanka for the Third Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project. Manila. ", "  3\n \n9.  In October 2002, the Parliament passed the Public Utilities Commission Act, which sets \nthe institutional framework for the power, the WSS, and the transport sectors.  Although the \nPUC  provides  a  common  structure,  each  sector  will  be  governed  by  specific  industry \nregulations.  The development of the legal framework for regulating the WSS is a new field in Sri \nLanka. The Government has developed a unit dedicated to oversee the development and \nmanagement of the ongoing water sector reforms, including the development of the regulations \nand specific guidelines to implement the provision of the regulations. The WSR Unit within \nMH&PI has requested ADB to provide assistance in the form of international and domestic \nexpertise to support the work program. \n \n10.  The National Policy on Private Sector Participation in Water Supply and Sanitation of 4 \nOctober 1999 stated that eight urban water supply schemes, including Greater Negombo and \nthe Kalutara-Galle Coastal Area, had been selected as pilot projects for PSP. The World Bank \nunder its Private Sector Infrastructure Development Project, which started in 1996, funded two \nstudies for Greater Negombo and the Kalutara-Galle Coastal Area to assess the PSP potential. \nThe studies were completed in June 2002. Recently, the World Bank and the Government \nagreed  on  an  indicative  processing  timetable  for  privatizing  Negombo  and  Kalutara-Galle.  \nTransaction processing is expected to begin in July 2003 and the effective transfer of service in \n2005.  Because the WSR Act will regulate both private and public water providers, the World \nBank has been supporting the WSR Unit on issues related to the participation of the private \nsector, and the World Bank and ADB have been coordinating to ensure that the proposed \nregulatory framework is conducive to PSP. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n11.  The TA will help develop and disseminate regulations for the water sector within the \nframework  of  the  PUC  to  facilitate  credible,  independent,  autonomous,  accountable,  and \ntransparent regulation for WSS providers in Sri Lanka. The regulations will protect the interests \nof all stakeholders including the poor, and will aim at providing incentives for efficiency, and \nservice coverage and quality at affordable prices. The goal of the TA is to promote good \ngovernance  in  the  WSS  sector  and  to  create  enabling  conditions  that  are  conducive  to \nparticipation by the local government and the private sector. \n \n12.  The TA will assist the Government to develop the legislation and expertise to implement \nthe provisions in the PUC Act for the WSS sector. The outputs will be (i) finalizing the draft \nWater Reform Act, (ii) providing a set of guidelines to implement the various provisions of the \nWater Reform Act, and (iii) training in sector reform and regulatory issues for staff in key water \nsector institutions.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The  TA  will  comprise  two  components:  (i)  developing  adequate  legislation  and \nguidelines to regulate the water sector, and (ii) developing institutional capacity for regulatory \nlegislation and guidelines. \n \n ", " 4\n1.  Development of Legislation and Guidelines \n \n14.  The TA will assist the Government in finalizing the WSR Act by reviewing the draft WSR \nAct to ensure its consistency with the PUC Act, the draft National Policy for Water Supply and \nSanitation, and other sector-related legislation and its compatibility with ongoing sector reforms, \nsuch  as  PSP  and  decentralization.  The  draft  will  be  reviewed  in  consultation  with  major \nstakeholders and taking into account best international practice in regulating the water sector. \nThe Act will be specific on issues such as licensing the service providers, setting tariffs, service \nstandards and efficiency indicators, consumers' rights and obligations, and dispute resolution. \nThe TA will also assist the Government in developing a set of detailed guidelines to implement \nthe provision of the WSR Act. \n \n2.  Development of Institutional Capacity \n \n15.  The TA will provide an international adviser on water sector regulation to assist the \nGovernment in finalizing the WSR Act. It will also provide training opportunities in water sector \nregulation to management and high-level professionals directly responsible for implementing \nsector reforms and regulations in the water sector, and training in the provisions of the WSR Act \nand regulatory guidelines to professionals in operational levels of institutions affected by the \nnew  role  of  the  PUC  and  the  WSR  Act,  including  local  government  officials  with  direct \nresponsibility for providing water and sanitation services. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $360,000 equivalent, of which $239,500 will be \nforeign exchange costs and $120,500 equivalent will be local currency costs. ADB will finance \n$285,000 equivalent, which includes the entire foreign currency costs and $45,500 equivalent in \nlocal currency costs.  The remaining $75,000 equivalent will be contributed by the Government \nand will include office accommodation, transportation, counterpart staff remuneration and per \ndiem, and others. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded \nby the Government of Japan. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  MH&PI will be the executing agency for the TA. The TA will be implemented through the \nWSR Unit under MH&PI. A steering committee chaired by MH&PI will be formed to lead in \nconsulting other agencies and coordinating the TA. The committee will have members from the \nNational  Water  Supply  and  Drainage  Board;  the  Ministry  of  Policy  Development  and \nImplementation; the Ministry of Economic Reform, Science and Technology; and the Local \nGovernment Ministry as well as aid agencies like the World Bank and the Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation. MH&PI will appoint a member secretary for the committee. The \nsteering committee will meet once a month during the TA to review progress and resolve any \nissues that may arise. All representatives will be at least on the director level. MH&PI will \nprovide office space, furniture, equipment, and water sector experts as counterpart staff for the \nTA consultants, as necessary.  \n \n18.  The TA implementing unit will include qualified and experienced counterpart staff from \nrelevant line ministries to work alongside the TA consultants. Staff competencies will be relevant \nto regulation in the water supply sector, law, financial and economic analyses, and PSP in water \nsupply projects. Counterpart staff will work full-time and part-time in an agreed-upon mix under \nthe overall direction of the head of the unit.  ", "  5\n \n19.  The TA will be carried out over 12 months, beginning around March 2003 until February \n2004.  The  consulting  team  will  include  international  consultants  (10  person-months)  and \ndomestic consultants (20 person-months). All consultants will be selected and engaged through \na  firm  following  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The simplified format for technical \nproposals and the quality- and cost-based selection method will be used. The international \nconsultants will have hands-on expertise in water sector regulation and will include a lawyer, an \neconomist,  and  a  policy  specialist.  The  domestic  consultants  will  include  a  water  supply \nspecialist,  a  lawyer,  a  tariff  specialist,  an  economist,  and  an  institutional  specialist  with \nexperience in the water sector in Sri Lanka.
