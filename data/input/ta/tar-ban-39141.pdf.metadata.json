In December 2004, the Government of Bangladesh (the Government) requested that the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) provide technical assistance (TA) for the corporatization of the \nBangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB). ADB Management approved the TA concept \npaper in April 20051 and a fact-finding mission was conducted from 9 to 16 May 2005. An \nunderstanding  was  reached  with  the  Government  on  the  TA\u2019s  impact  and  outcome, \nmethodology and key activities, cost and financing, implementation arrangements, and terms of \nreference. The Government approved the Technical Assistance Project Proforma in April 2004 \nand confirmed the aide-memoire of the fact-finding mission on 31 May 2005. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Inadequate  electricity  supply  and  very  low  levels  of  access  to  electricity  are  major \nconstraints  to  Bangladesh\u2019s  economic  growth.  Only  about  one  third  of  the  population  has \naccess  to  electricity  and  per  capita  generation  is  among  the  lowest  in  the  world,  about \n155 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year. At the same time, demand is rising: consumption grew at an \naverage annual rate of 8.2% from FY1994 to FY2004, and it is forecast to grow at about 8% per \nyear  for  the  next  10  years.  The  current  dependable  generating  capacity  is  about  3,950 \nmegawatts (MW) and, during FY2004, load in the range of 8\u2013540 MW was shed for a total of \n951 hours over 232 days. Bangladesh is facing an anticipated shortfall of about 2,500 MW of \ngenerating capacity over the next 5 years, hence the need to attract more domestic and foreign \ninvestment to meet demand. \n \n3.  As well as the lack of physical infrastructure, Bangladesh\u2019s power sector has faced \ncritical  financial  challenges,  including  insolvency  (e.g.,  BPDB  owes  the  Government  Tk56 \nbillion). The power sector has also suffered from poor accounting practices, which have resulted \nin delayed account and audit completion, overvaluation of assets, underestimation of expenses, \nand inadequate provision for bad debts. Poor governance\u2014low billing collection ratios and high \nsystem losses\u2014has hampered the power sector\u2019s development and financial sustainability. \n \n4.  In 1994, the Government adopted a policy paper entitled Power Sector Reforms in \nBangladesh (PSRB), which was formulated in consultation with major development partners in \nthe power sector. According to the PSRB, the long-term structure of the power sector will \nfeature  (i)  a  separation  of  sector  regulation  and  operation;  (ii)  autonomy  and  commercial \norientation of the sector entities; (iii) unbundling of generation, transmission, and distribution; \nand (iv) more private sector participation. Under this structure, power transmission will remain in \nthe public sector, while generation and distribution assets will be both publicly and privately \nowned. The objective is to eliminate monopolies and foster competition, in an effort to promote \ncommercial discipline and good customer service. A new regulatory authority will be established \nfor  (i)  setting  electricity  tariffs  and  determining  the  corresponding  performance  norms;  (ii) \ncollecting, verifying, and disseminating sector statistics; (iii) reviewing and approving long-term \npower planning; (iv) creating and maintaining a nondiscriminatory and commercial business \nenvironment  in  the  sector;  and  (v)  adjudicating  disputes  between  sector  entities.  These \nrestructuring reforms are designed to attract more investment in the power sector and they are \nreinforced and prioritized in the policy agenda of the Government\u2019s draft 2005\u20132007 poverty \nreduction strategy paper for the power sector. \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 25 April 2005. \n ", "2   \n5.  Bangladesh\u2019s  power  sector  is  under  the  Ministry  of  Power,  Energy  and  Mineral \nResources  (MPEMR),  which  wholly  owns  and  supervises  BPDB,  Dhaka  Electric  Supply \nAuthority (DESA), and the Rural Electrification Board (REB). Until the late 1990s, BPDB was \nresponsible for national generation and most transmission, as well as distribution in district \ntowns, municipalities, and some rural areas; DESA was responsible for distribution in the Dhaka \narea. At present, about 70 rural electric cooperatives\u2014organized, initially funded, and monitored \nby REB\u2014are in charge of distribution in most rural areas. As part of the power sector reform, \nnew public sector entities\u2014such as the Power Grid Company of Bangladesh Limited (PGCB), \nDhaka Electric Supply Company Limited (DESCO), West Zone Power Distribution Company \nLimited (WZPDCL), and Ashuganj Power Station Company Limited (APSCL)\u2014as well as private \nsector independent power producers\u2014such as the Rural Power Company Limited and the \nElectricity Generation Company of Bangladesh\u2014have been constituted. PGCB has taken over \nall BPDB\u2019s transmission assets and DESCO has secured DESA\u2019s distribution assets in Mirpur \nand Gulshan, Dhaka. WZPDCL and APSCL have taken over BPDB\u2019s distribution assets in the \nwest  and  generation  assets  in  Ashuganj  Power  Station,  respectively.  BPDB  is  currently \nresponsible  for  about  60%  of  electricity  generation  and  about  30%  of  distribution.  The \nBangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) was established in March 2004 under the \nnew Energy Regulatory Commission Act 2003.2  \n \n6.  The aforementioned changes in the business environment and organizational set-up \nyielded  major  improvements  in  the  operational  and  financial  performance  of  power  sector \nentities. For example, overall system losses (based on gross generation) decreased from 37% \n(FY1994) to 27% (FY2004), while billing collection rates rose from 80% (1994) to over 90% \n(2004). The Government\u2019s reform initiatives culminated in the Cabinet Committee on Economic \nAffairs\u2019 approval of corporatization plans for BPDB (January 2004), BPDB\u2019s northwest zone \ndistribution network (March 2004), and DESA (July 2004). \n \n7.  ADB  is  a  long-term  lead  development  partner  of  the  Government  in  power  sector \nrestructuring  and  reform.  ADB  supports  the  Government\u2019s  implementation  of  the  PSRB  in \npromoting  good  governance  at  the  sectoral  and  corporate  levels.  At  the  sectoral  level, \ngovernance is to be improved through (i) predictability\u2014long-term planning, codification of rules \nand  regulations,  and  independence  of  regulatory  processes;  (ii)  transparency\u2014systematic \ndissemination of relevant sector information, public hearings, and discussions on issues before \nthey  are  decided;  and  (iii)  accountability\u2014the  cause\u2013effect  structure  of  incentives.  At  the \ncorporate level, governance is to be enhanced through (i) corporatization, (ii) independence of \nthe boards of directors from the Government, (iii) introduction of a work-based pay structure, \n(iv) defined delegation of powers to staff, (v) computerized management information systems \n(MIS), and (vi) commercialization of activities. ADB has approved three TA projects relevant to \nthis reform: corporatization of the Ashuganj Power Station,3 BPDB\u2019s west zone distribution \nsystem,4  and    DESA.5  ADB  is  also  assisting  corporatization  of  BPDB\u2019s  northwest  zone \ndistribution network under a loan.6 The World Bank is financing a TA project for financial \n                                                 \n2   The US Agency for International Development (USAID) is assisting BERC capacity building. \n3  ADB. 2000.

BPDB \nhas drafted a memorandum and articles of association to corporatize BPDB as a holding \ncompany,  and  the  Government  has  agreed  to  establish  a  task  force  with  qualified  and \nexperienced staff by September 2005, before TA consultants are fielded. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA will assist the Government and BPDB to (i) corporatize BPDB as a holding \ncompany, (ii) introduce appropriate financial and management systems in the new company, \nand  (iii)  integrate  the new  company  into  the  power  sector  network.  It  will  define  the  new \ncompany\u2019s relationship with subsidiaries and other sector entities. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  By the time the consultants are fielded, it is expected that the necessary documents for \ncorporatization of BPDB (such as the memorandum and articles of association) will have been \nfiled with the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies of Bangladesh, and the task force will have \nbeen  established.  The  consultants  will  work  jointly  with  the  task  force  so  that  task  force \npersonnel will be involved throughout the TA. All TA deliverables will emerge as being fully \n\u201cowned\u201d by the task force.  \n \n10.  The TA will be divided into two phases. Phase I (about 4 months) will develop the overall \napproach to the corporatization of BPDB, creating further subsidiaries, and defining the legal \nand accounting formalities for transferring BPDB assets and liabilities to the new company. \nPhase II will develop more concrete options and recommendations for the corporatization of \nBPDB, detail the new company\u2019s MIS, and assist in the corporatization and initial operations of \nthe  new  company.  The  TA\u2019s  key  activities  will  be  to  devise  appropriate  strategies  for \n(i) evaluating assets, (ii) establishing a viable financing plan, (iii) formulating personnel policies, \n(iv) organizing the transfer of assets and staff to the new company, (v) organizing the voluntary \nseparation scheme for eligible BPDB staff, (vi) examining and organizing the sale of BPDB\u2019s \nshares in its subsidiary companies, and (vii) implementing MIS. The consultants will coordinate \nclosely  with  teams  from  other  relevant  studies\u2014including  the  ADB  TA  projects  on  the \ncorporatization of DESA and preparing the Power Sector Development Program II, and the \nWorld  Bank\u2019s  TA  for  power  sector  reform\u2014to  ensure  smooth  implementation  and  non-\nduplication of work. Phase II will begin near the completion of Phase I. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,030,000 equivalent, comprising $590,000 in \nforeign  exchange  costs  and  $440,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs.  The  full  foreign \nexchange costs of $590,000 equivalent and $210,000 equivalent of the local currency costs for \na total of $800,000 will be financed on a grant basis from the ADB\u2019s Japan Special Fund, funded \nby the Government of Japan. The Government will contribute the remaining $230,000 of local \ncurrency costs in kind, as office space and facilities, counterpart staff, local transportation, and \nadministrative  and  secretarial  support.  Detailed  cost  estimates  and  financing  plans  are  in \nAppendix 2. \n \n ", "4   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  The Power Division of the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources (MPEMR) \nwill be the Executing Agency for the TA. To enable smooth implementation of the study and \ntransfer of knowledge, a task force with suitably qualified and experienced staff will be set up \nbefore the consultants are fielded. MPEMR will provide, free of charge to the consultants\u2019 team, \noffice accommodation and facilities, and transport within Bangladesh. MPEMR will assist the \nconsultants in data gathering, preliminary analysis, and report writing. The entire work, including \nreport writing, will be done in Bangladesh to maximize transfer of knowledge. The consultants \nwill make their own arrangements for personal computers and other facilities for producing \nreports. \n \n13.  The  consultants  will  purchase  the  equipment  listed  in  Appendix  2  following  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. Although the guidelines allow for direct purchase, consultants \nshould seek quotations from at least three suppliers. All equipment purchased under the TA \nshould be used by the consultants and MPEMR during the TA, and handed over to MPEMR \nwhen the TA is completed. The list of equipment will be finalized during the inception stage in \nconsultation with MPEMR, and will be submitted to ADB for review and concurrence prior to \npurchase. \n \n14.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months from October 2005 to October 2006. ADB \nwill  select  and  engage  an  international  consulting  firm,  supported  by  associated  domestic \nconsultants,  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  The  simplified \ntechnical proposal and quality- and cost-based selection will be applied to select the consulting \nfirm. The TA will require 20 person-months of international consulting services and 40 person-\nmonths of domestic consulting services. The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. \n \n15.  The TA will require input from an international consulting firm with expertise in corporate \nrestructuring and governance, human resources, MIS, law, and commerce. The international \nconsultants will be supported by domestic consultants in the above areas. The international \nconsulting firm will propose a suitable combination of expertise and allocation of person-months, \nand appoint an international consultant as team leader\u2014a technical expert responsible for the \noverall management and coordination of the TA study.  \n \n16.  The consultant will submit an inception report (1 month after appointment), a midterm \nreport (after 6 months), a draft final report (after 10 months), and a final report (after 12 months). \nThe inception report will detail initial findings and the consultant\u2019s proposed action plan. The first \ntripartite meeting among the Government, ADB and the consultants will review the inception \nreport in Dhaka within 3 weeks of receiving it. A midterm report will describe the TA\u2019s progress, \nperson-months utilized, problems encountered, and proposed revision of the work plan; and will \nincorporate detailed reports on completion of Phase I activities. A draft final report will detail the \nconsultants\u2019 findings and recommendations. The second and third tripartite meetings will review \nthe midterm and draft final reports, respectively. The consultants will organize (i) a workshop \nafter the second tripartite meeting to brief stakeholders and receive their feedback on the \ncorporatization program, MIS, and procedures to be implemented, and (ii) a seminar at the \nconclusion of the TA to disseminate the findings. The final report will be submitted within 4 \nweeks after the tripartite review of the draft final report.  \n \n ", "  5\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.
