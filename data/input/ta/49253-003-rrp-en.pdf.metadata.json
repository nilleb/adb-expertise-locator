THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic of Uzbekistan for the Power Generation Efficiency Improvement Project. The report \nalso describes the proposed administration of technical assistance (TA) to be provided by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction for the Power Sector Reform and Sustainability Support \nProgram, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, approve the administration of the TA.  \n \n2.  The project will (i) help Uzbekistan address the widening electricity demand\u2013supply gap \nby installing additional 900 megawatt (MW) generation capacity in a least-cost and most efficient \nmanner through combined cycle gas turbine units (CCGT) at the existing Talimarjan thermal \npower plant (TPP); and (ii) complement and deepen ongoing sector reforms, strengthen financial \nmanagement practices, and improve the corporate governance of Uzbekenergo, the largest \npower utility of Uzbekistan. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Over the past decade, the Uzbekistan economy grew robustly at an average rate of 8%, \nlifting a significant number of people out of poverty.1 The energy sector underpins Uzbekistan\u2019s \nsustained growth, contributing to 10% of its gross domestic product and a quarter of its exports. \nHowever, Uzbekistan is also one of the most energy-intensive economies in the world. Its aging \nand dilapidated Soviet era energy and industrial infrastructure is a major factor for the prevailing \npoor energy efficiency. Lack of adequate investments in new power plants is inhibiting the \nretirement of old and inefficient power plants (para. 4). Uzbekistan has adopted an ambitious \nprogram to pursue an industrialized, upper middle-income country status by 2030 (Vision 2030).2 \nEnergy sector modernization and reforms are the centerpiece of this vision.   \n \n4.  Uzbekistan is rich in hydrocarbon resources with large proven reserves of about 1.8 trillion \ncubic meter of natural gas, 600 million barrels of oil, and 3 billion tons of coal. The primary energy \nconsumption of Uzbekistan is dominated by natural gas, which provides 82% of its energy mix.3 \nUzbekistan is the eighth largest producer of natural gas in the world. In 2016, it produced more \nthan 62 billion cubic meters of natural gas, of which 20% was exported.4 Natural gas is also the \ndominating fuel in the country\u2019s electricity generation mix, contributing 85% of the total electricity \nproduced in 2016 (59 terawatt-hours [TWh]).5 The installed generation capacity in the country is \n13.4 gigawatts, of which more than 11 gigawatts is fueled by natural gas TPPs. However, more \nthan 40% of this capacity is in 40\u201350 years old plants, which are in poor condition and require \nurgent replacement and/or major rehabilitation.  \n                                                \n1  Based on yearly Basic Statistics (ADB), the portion of population below the national poverty line has declined steadily \nfrom 27.5% in 2002 to 12.8% in 2015.   \n2  Government of Uzbekistan. 2015. Decree of the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan No UP-4707 dated 4 March \n2015 on the Program of Measures to Promote Structural Reforms, Modernization and Diversification of Production \nin 2015\u20132019. Tashkent; and Government of Uzbekistan. 2015. Decree of the President of the Republic of \nUzbekistan No UP-4947 dated 7 February 2017 on the Strategy of Actions on Further Development of Uzbekistan. \nTashkent. \n3  Oil (10%), hydropower (5%), and coal (3%) are other primary energy sources in the energy mix.  \n4  Based on estimates in the BP Statistical Review of World Energy, June 2017.  \n5  Total electricity generation was 47.2 TWh in 2003 and 51.1 TWh in 2010. \n ", "2 \n5.  The weighted average thermal efficiency of its gas-based thermal power generation \nfleet is 33%, and some plants have efficiencies as low as 23%,6 compared with modern \nCCGTs  with  thermal  efficiencies  of  53%\u201360%. 7  Uzbekistan  has  more  than  230,000 \nkilometers  of  transmission  and  distribution  lines  with  an  average  age  of  30  years. \nTransmission and distribution losses are high at more than 20%.   \n \n6.   Aging infrastructure and insufficient investments have increasingly resulted in unreliable \npower supply in recent years. The World Bank estimates the electricity supply\u2013demand gap at \n2,085 gigawatt-hours in 2016, and to reach 14,624 gigawatt-hours by 2020 if required investments \nare not made. Blackouts are still occasional for 4\u20136 hours a day during winter when electricity \ndemand is highest in both rural areas and big cities. Hardest hit are the socially vulnerable people \nin the southern and western regions of Uzbekistan. Schools and hospitals are unable to fully \noperate in late autumn and winter because of the lack of reliable electricity, putting education and \nhealth care systems at risk. Power shortages are often considered high risk for doing business in \na country where investor interest is eroding.  \n \n7.  Uzbekistan is strategically located for power trade with neighboring countries and is the \nlargest power exporter to Afghanistan, supplying 35% of its electricity demand in 2015.8 In the \ninterconnected and coordinated power system of the Soviet era, Uzbekistan was expected to use \nits fossil fuel generation to make up for autumn and winter power shortages in hydropower-rich \ncountries such as the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan. Improving efficient power generation \ncapacity in Uzbekistan can increase power trade with neighboring countries, improving electricity \nsupply security across Central Asia.   \n \n8.  In coordination with development partners, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been \nsupporting Uzbekistan\u2019s energy sector through a two-pronged strategy of (i) investing in critical \nenergy infrastructure to modernize and upgrade the system and (ii) leveraging incremental sector \nreforms and governance improvement.9 In April 2010, ADB approved the first energy project in \nUzbekistan, which included the installation of 900 MW CCGT units at the Talimarjan TPP in \nsouthern Uzbekistan.10 In August 2017, CCGT units designed to generate 6.5 TWh of electricity \nannually were successfully put into operation, alleviating some of the existing electricity shortages \n(para. 5).11 The reform elements under the Talimarjan Power Project included the introduction of \nfinancial reporting following International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) at Uzbekenergo \n(footnote 10), a vertically integrated stated-owned enterprises (SOE) for thermal power generation \nincluding Talimarjan TPP, transmission and distribution. This helped Uzbekenergo generate its \nfirst IFRS consolidated financial statements for FY2015 and adopt external audits based on the \nInternational Standards on Auditing starting FY2011, contributing to improved accountability, \ntransparency, and good governance.12  \n                                                \n6  World Bank. 2013. Uzbekistan Energy/Power Sector Issues Note. Washington, DC. \n7  Substituting old plants with modern CCGTs would allow the country to produce an additional 40%\u201345% of total \ngeneration from the existing capacity. The weighted average thermal efficiency means an average of thermal \nefficiency resulting from the multiplication of capacity of each power plant by its efficiency.  \n8  Uzbekistan export to Afghanistan in 2016 was about 1,500 GWh or less than 3% of the total electricity produced. \n9  The World Bank is supporting transmission system upgrade and industrial energy efficiency improvements.  \n10  ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loans and \nAdministration of Loan to the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Talimarjan Power Project. Manila. The proposed project \nis the fifth energy project in Uzbekistan. ADB assistance is ongoing for all aspects of energy including power \ngeneration, transmission modernization, and advanced metering project in distribution side. \n11  After initial delays in finalizing the turnkey contract for the CCGT units, a complex and high-value procurement, the \nproject was implemented smoothly.    \n12 The submitted IFRS consolidated financial statements for FY2015 are unaudited. An international firm of auditors is \ncurrently performing the audit. \n \n ", "3 \n9.  The  government  is  committed  to  reforms  and  liberalization.  In  September  2017,  it \nannounced the bold and much-needed policy action to unify its foreign exchange regime and \nallow the sum (Uzbekistan currency) to float against foreign currencies. While this policy action is \nexpected to reap important medium- to long-term economic benefits, it has caused a sharp \ndepreciation of the local currency by about 90% against the US dollar in the short term. 13  This \nhas led to a deterioration of Uzbekenergo\u2019s debt\u2013equity ratio because of the utility\u2019s exposure to \nforeign currency debts. In response, Uzbekenergo proactively launched a time-bound financial \nrecovery  action  plan  prioritizing  the  following  measures:  (i)  revenue  increase  through \ndevelopment and implementation of tariff methodology, (ii) corporate restructuring and divestment \nof noncore assets, and (iii) improvement of operating efficiency and IFRS-compliant classification \nand impairment provisions on account receivables and payables.14  \n \n10.  The project will install an additional 900 MW CCGT capacity at the Talimarjan TPP to \ndirectly address the issues discussed in paras. 4\u20136 and help the government initiative to retire \n3.4 gigawatts of old generation capacity. It will also support the government\u2019s sector reforms and \nUzbekenergo\u2019s financial recovery action plan through (i) developing a power sector master plan \nto  rationalize  long-term  investments;  (ii)  preparing  a  tariff  reform  road  map  to  increase \nUzbekenergo\u2019s revenue to the level of full cost recovery including pass-through of costs arising \nfrom external factors such as foreign exchange rate risks, and fuel prices; (iii) introducing IFRS to \na key power generation subsidiary of Uzbekenergo, which will be replicated in other subsidiaries \nand  pave  the  way  for  corporatization  of  generation  companies;  and  (iv)  supporting  the \ndevelopment of a detailed implementation plan for Uzbekenergo\u2019s financial recovery action plan. \nThese reform actions will complement the budget support program requested by the government \nto cushion the impact of foreign exchange reform.  \n \n11.  The project is aligned with the government\u2019s strategic emphasis on the energy efficiency \nenhancement and reliable power supply to support its vision for an upper middle-income country \nby 2030 (footnote 2). It is included in the country operations business plan, 2017\u20132019 for \nUzbekistan as a priority project and is also well aligned with the Country Partnership Strategy \n(2012\u20132016) for Uzbekistan\u2019s priority to support for energy efficiency to generate power surpluses \nto expand energy export to Afghanistan and other energy-deficient countries in the region. The \nproject also directly supports the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program (CAREC) \nenergy strategy, which prioritizes energy security, and reliable and more affordable energy \nservices in the region through balanced development of region\u2019s energy sources and stronger \nintegration of energy markets.15 The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s energy policy supporting \nimproved energy security and reduced emissions of greenhouse gases through the energy \nefficiency improvement, which will contribute Uzbekistan\u2019s nationally determined contributions \nunder the Paris Agreement of reducing carbon intensity by 10% by 2030 from its 2010 level.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The project impact will be reliable energy supply increased and energy intensity reduced \n(footnote 2). The outcome will be efficiency and reliability of power supply improved.16  \n                                                \n13 As of 1 September 2017, the exchange rate of 1 Uzbekistan Sum was $0.00024, which became $0.000123 on 7 \nSeptember 2017 after foreign exchange unification.     \n14 Government of Uzbekistan. 2017.

Outputs \n \n13.  Output 1: Talimarjan thermal power plant capacity increased. Output 1 will expand \nTalimarjan TPP capacity by an additional 900 MW through the installation of two 450 MW CCGT \nunits in combined heat and power mode.17 The combined heat and power feature will supplement \nthe heat supply to nearby Nuriston town to meet its growing heat demand for household and rural \nsmall businesses, obviating the need for additional heat-only boilers. The addition will increase \nthe aggregate capacity of Talimarjan TPP to 2,600 MW and improve its average thermal efficiency \nfrom 48% to 52%.18  \n \n14.  Output 2: Uzbekenergo financial operation and performance improved. Output 2 will \naddress challenges constraining Uzbekenergo\u2019s capacity to generate adequate cash for capital \ninvestments. Attached TA (para. 20) will directly contribute to output 2 by undertaking critical \nanalytical work to prepare a sound basis for the next generation of reforms. In particular, the TA \nwill undertake (a) the development of a power sector master plan; (b) tariff reform roadmap (para. \n10); and (c) associated capacity building to support and deepen sector reforms, strengthen \nfinancial management practices, and improve corporate governance of Uzbekenergo. TA outputs \nwill be firmed up after extensive stakeholder consultations. \n \n15.  Output 3: Institutional capacity enhanced. Output 3 will strengthen the capacity for the \noperation and maintenance of the plant, and provide technical support for the timely and adequate \nmaintenance of gas turbines. Under the project, an operational plan for the community social \ncenter will be developed and implemented to strengthen ongoing gender mainstreaming activities. \n \nD.

The project will be located adjacent to the existing Talimarjan TPP within the power \ncomplex and will not require any additional land acquisition. The power complex was originally \ndesigned to accommodate 3,200 MW capacity with sufficient supporting infrastructure including \nfuel supply, cooling water systems, and power evacuation. It includes 800 MW gas-fired steam-\ncycle units (commissioned by Uzbekenergo in 2004) and 900 MW CCGT units (financed by ADB \nin  2010).  The  power  from  the  project  will  be  evacuated  through  the  existing  500-kilovolt \ntransmission lines. Natural gas is supplied by Uzbekneftegas, a state-owned gas company, from \nthe  Shuritan  gas  field,  which  is  located  30  kilometers  away  from  the  power  complex. \nUzbekneftegas confirmed that an additional 4.4 million cubic meters per day will be provided via \nthe existing gas pipeline infrastructure to support the new unit. Cooling water requirement is \n                                                \n22  Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nsupplied from the Karshi main canal with water sourced primarily from the Amu Darya River with \nback-up supply from Talimarjan reservoir. \n \n22.  The project will use commercially available and well-proven gas turbine technology and \nCCGT units with a thermal efficiency of 58% or higher and a capacity of 850\u2013950 MW. The project \nconfiguration includes two gas turbines, two heat-recovery steam generators, one or two steam \nturbines, and supporting facilities. The combined heat and power feature provides an alternative \nsupply to the existing heat boilers as required during the winter heating months. This provides a \nflexible, reliable, and highly efficient way of providing heat to the aging heat supply boilers. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n23.  The project is economically viable with an economic internal rate of return of 15.3%, \nexceeding the benchmark 9% discount rate. The financial analysis of the project provides the \nfinancial internal rate of return of 6.3%, which compares favorably with the weighted average cost \nof capital of 1.7%. Financial viability is gauged by comparing the revenue and cost streams of \nscenarios with and without the project. The result of a sensitivity analysis confirms that the \nproject\u2019s economic and financial viability is robust even under unfavorable circumstances. The \nfinancial internal rate of return is based on assumptions of increases in end-user tariffs and fuel \nprices, which are estimated based on historical trends in tariff adjustments from 2010 to 2017. In \ncase of insufficient tariff increase, the government has assured that it will provide debt servicing \nand operation coverage to Uzbekenergo. \n \n24.  The sharp depreciation of local currency and its impacts on Uzbekenergo\u2019s debt\u2013equity \nratio (para. 9) has resulted in a breach of financial covenants of the ongoing ADB loan for the \nTalimarjan Power Project (footnote 10). Uzbekenergo has developed a robust financial recovery \naction plan to urgently address this and is committed to complementary reforms. The timely \nimplementation of this action plan is crucial to keep the ongoing reforms on track and pave the \nway for the next generation of reforms. In the interim, it is imperative that Uzbekenergo is allowed \na grace period and suitably adjusted financial covenants to maximize the results of the action plan. \nAccordingly, the project includes more realistic financial covenants as an interim measure and \nseeks timely implementation of the action plan through appropriately formulated covenants. \nOutput  2  analytical  work  will  complement  the  action  plan  and  help  guide  ADB  and  other \ndevelopment partners\u2019 further assistance in key areas to ensure timely implementation as well as \na successful outcome from the action plan.  \n \nC.  Governance \n \n25.  Sector governance. The power sector is under the direct supervision of the cabinet of \nministers and is managed by Uzbekenergo. The energy policy and the long-term investment plan \nare prepared by the cabinet in coordination with ministries and government agencies. The long-\nterm investment plan (2011\u20132015) was updated annually and a new plan for 2015\u20132019 was \nannounced in March 2015. The Ministry of Finance sets the tariff for utility costs. Licenses are \nissued  by  the  State  Inspection  on  Supervision  for  the  Power  Industry  under  the  cabinet. \nInstitutional capacity development activities for Uzbekenergo, such as strengthening safeguard \nassessment, bringing in modern and transparent performance assessment, and upgrading the \nmanagement information system, are under way with ADB support. \n \n \n26.  Financial management. With insufficient capacity for transparent financial disclosures, \nUzbekenergo\u2019s financial management risk is high. Uzbekenergo was able to prepare its first IFRS-\nbased  consolidated  accounts  for  FY2015  only  in  2017  because  of  the  complexity  of  its \n ", "8 \nsubsidiaries\u2019  accounts  and  limited  accounting  skills.  Uzbekenergo\u2019s  insufficient  capacity  to \ngenerate its IFRS-based financial statements on a timely basis has resulted in a substantial delay \nin carrying out the entity\u2019s audit. These capacity issues have also resulted in non-compliance with \nsubmission of audited financial statements for the past 2 years under ongoing ADB loans.  The \ngovernment committed to improve Uzbekenergo\u2019s management capacity including corporate \ngovernance,  financial  and  management  reporting,  audit,  and  performance  management \nframeworks. Attached TA will help Uzbekenergo enhance the capacity of accounting staff and \nautomate account consolidation and the management reporting process. Loan covenants have \nbeen included to recruit sufficient qualified financial management accounting staff.    \n \n27.  Procurement capacity. Although Uzbekenergo has procurement experience in similar \nprojects, the inherent procurement risks are high because of the technical complexity and contract \nvalues. An international firm will be hired as project management and supervision consultant to \nassist  in  the  bidding  process  and  contract  management.  The  government\u2019s  procurement \nprocedure is undergoing reform to improve the efficiency and transparency of the procurement \nprocess.  Under  the  reform,  Uzbekenergo  will  establish  an  interagency  tender  committee \ncomprising representatives from government agencies and design institutes.  \n \n28.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and Uzbekenergo. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n29.  The project\u2019s targeting classification is general intervention. The increased reliability of \npower supply and stable access to grid-connected electricity would indirectly benefit all segments \nof the population, including poor people. Adequate and reliable electricity supply will improve daily \nlife and enable increased economic activity.  \n  \n30.  The  project  is  assigned  some  gender  elements.  It  will  strengthen  gender-inclusive \ngovernance and management of the community social center (built as part of the gender action \nplan under the Talimarjan Power Project) through an operational plan that aims to empower \nwomen. The direct employment of women will be encouraged to maintain the momentum. A social \nand gender specialist in the project management unit will provide support.   \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n31.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.23 \n \n32.  Environment (category A). A draft environmental impact assessment (EIA) report was \ndisclosed  in  June  2017  in  both  English  and  Russian  languages.  Public  consultation  was \nconducted  in  November  2016,  January  2017,  and  September  2017  for  the  two  nearest \ncommunities (Nuriston and Mekhnatabad) at the scoping stage and twice on the draft EIA report. \nAll issues raised during the consultation were adequately addressed in the final EIA. The EIA \nincludes an environmental management plan  (EMP) and due diligence assessment with a \ncorrective action plan for existing facilities. The EIA report identified potential impacts that would \nbe generated from the project, and proposed an adequate EMP consisting of mitigation measures, \n                                                \n23  ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n ", "9 \nmonitoring plan, cost, and arrangements for EMP implementation. The EMP will form part of the \nbidding documents.  \n \n33.  Some project impacts are expected during both construction and operation phases in the \nalready disturbed environment of the Talimarjan power complex. The main concerns include \n(i) cumulative impact from the new CCGT units on air quality and noise level at the project site \nand in the residential areas of Nuriston and Mekhnatabad; (ii) the discharge of heated water, \nwastewater from the sewer and chemical treatment plant, solid waste, and construction waste; \nand (iii) occupational safety. With the adopted emission control technology of CCGT units and \ngas fuel quality, air quality dispersion modelling has confirmed that nitrogen oxides emission will \ncomply with the Environmental, Health, and Safety Guidelines of the International Finance \nCorporation, while sulfur dioxide and particulate matter 2.5 will be negligible. Noise generated \nfrom the project will be within the World Health Organization standards. The project will use a \nhybrid combination of once-through cooling and recirculation cooling using cooling towers. The \nrecirculation  cooling  mode  will  ensure  sufficient  flows  in  the  cooling  canal  and  limit  the \ntemperature  increase  caused  by  the  discharged  water  within  3\u00b0C  (in  compliance  with  the \nEnvironmental, Health, and Safety Guidelines). Social and fish surveys confirmed insignificant \nrisk to human health and economic activities as the water in the canal downstream is used only \nfor irrigation. A health impact assessment was conducted to establish a baseline for future \nmonitoring and to ensure that the project has no adverse impact on the human health. \n \n34.  The project management unit (PMU) will be responsible for implementing the EMP in \ncompliance  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  requirements  and  national  environmental  regulations.  A \nnational environmental consultant will supplement and strengthen PMU safeguard staff capacity. \nEnvironmental  specialists  of  the  project  implementation  consultant  will  help  the  PMU  in \noverseeing  the  implementation  of  the  EMP  and  corrective  action  plan.  The  engineering, \nprocurement, and construction contract will include costs for implementing mitigation measures; \nthe  consulting  services  of  the  project  implementation  consultant  will  include  costs  for \nenvironmental instrumental monitoring and supervision; and the PMU budget will include costs \nfor environmental consultant support and capacity building. Independent monitoring will be \narranged with the local environmental authority and will be covered under the PMU budget. The \nproject will use the grievance redress mechanism in place for Talimarjan Power Project to handle \nboth environmental and social safeguard issues (footnote 10). Uzbekenergo will use its own \nresources to implement the corrective action plan. \n  \n35.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). Social due diligence suggests that no land \nacquisition and resettlement impacts are to be expected, because construction work will take \nplace within the boundaries of existing Talimarjan power complex.  \n \n36.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project will not affect indigenous peoples, as \ndefined by ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement.  \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n37.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.24 The integrated benefits and impacts of \nthe project are expected to outweigh the costs.  \n \n                                                \n24 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nDelayed procurement and  An international consulting firm will be recruited to assist Uzbekenergo \nimplementation of turnkey  in project implementation.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n38.  The government and Uzbekenergo have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. The government and Uzbekenergo \nhave agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the draft loan \nand project agreements. \n \n39.    As a condition for withdrawal from the loan account for any project expense item, a \nsubsidiary loan agreement for the relending of the ADB loan to Uzbekenergo shall have been \nsigned and become effective in accordance with the terms. In addition, no withdrawal will be made \nfrom the loan account for purposes of the turnkey contract until Uzbekenergo has furnished to \nADB its audited annual consolidated financial statements for the financial years 2015 and 2016 \nprepared in accordance with IFRS. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n40.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$450,000,000 to the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Power Generation Efficiency Improvement \nProject, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with interest to be determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term \nof 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years, and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board.  \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n21 November 2017\n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nReliable energy supply increased and energy intensity reduced (Decrees of the President of the Republic \nof Uzbekistan)a  \n \nPerformance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks  \nOutcome       \nEfficiency and  a.
