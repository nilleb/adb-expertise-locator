INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  proposed  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  the \nGovernment of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) to prepare a comprehensive hub-oriented \ntransportation strategy for Urumqi metropolitan area through research and analysis of current and \nfuture trends and best practices. The TA is included in the country operations business plan for \nthe PRC, 2017\u20132019 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).1  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Increased  regional  cooperation  and  integration  (RCI)  through  comprehensive  and \nintegrated transportation is an important part of the PRC\u2019s development strategies. The Thirteenth \nFive-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development, which covers the period 2016\u2013\n2020,  envisions  establishing  \u201ccomprehensive  transportation  thoroughfares  that  ensure \nunobstructed and interconnected domestic and international transportation.\u201d2 The Central Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) program, a partnership of 11 developing member \ncountries and 6 multilateral development partners, including the PRC (through Xinjiang Uygur \nAutonomous Region [XUAR] and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region)3 is aligned with the \nSilk  Road  Economic  Belt  and  21st  Century  Maritime  Silk  Road  development  strategy  and \nframework (also known as the Belt and Road Initiative)4 which is a catalyst for supporting \nincreased RCI and connectivity in the region and implementing the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan.  \n \n3.  The PRC\u2019s western provinces and autonomous regions are vital for achieving increased \nRCI. Located in the PRC\u2019s northwest, XUAR is a border area linking the PRC to Central Asia and \nis a priority for development. XUAR is an established trade intermediary between the rest of PRC \nand Central Asia, and this role is expected to strengthen with increased RCI-related trade as \nenvisioned under the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan and CAREC. In 2015, XUAR's exports\u2014including \ntransit from other PRC provinces\u2014to Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan accounted \nfor 62.3%, 74.7% and 76.7%, respectively, of the PRC's exports to these three markets. Trade \nvolumes through XUAR more than doubled between 2009 and 2014, increasing from 20.93 million \nmetric tons to 46.65 million metric tons.5 To support this increased trade, Phase 1 of the Urumqi \nChina\u2013Europe Freight Train Logistics Center was completed in 2016 and is expected to have a \nmarked effect on increasing the trade volumes through XUAR.  \n \n4.  Urban growth in XUAR is substantial, and the urban population is expected to reach 56% \nby 2020, nearly the targeted PRC average of 60%. Most of the urban population is in northern \nXUAR and concentrated in Urumqi, where the urban population will reach 4.65 million by 2020. \nMost of the city\u2019s residents travel by foot or public transport; however, as is the case across the \nPRC, private vehicle ownership has grown substantially, doubling between 2008 and 2013 to \n                                                \n1 The TA is listed as \u201cImplementing Strategies of Urumqi Towards a Modernized and Comprehensive Transport Hub-\nOriented City\u201d in: ADB. 2017.

Congestion in the city, especially on the main arterial \nroads, has also increased. Metro and bus rapid transit lines are under construction, but they may \nbe insufficient under the growth that is expected through expanded RCI-related trade. \n \n5.  XUAR aims to transform into a hub for transport, trade and logistics, finance, culture, \nscience and education, and medical services. Urumqi, the XUAR\u2019s capital, and its surrounding \ncities  will  lead  this  transformation  by  building  rail  and  road  networks;  upgrading  urban \ninfrastructure, inland port facilities, and the airport; and supporting the development of small and \nmedium-sized enterprises throughout the Urumqi metropolitan area. Urumqi\u2019s transformation will \nbe possible only if the existing and future transport constraints are alleviated; congestion and \nfragmentation,  and  the  resulting  inefficiencies  in  moving  people  and  goods,  are  major \nimpediments to the growth of cities. Many of the PRC\u2019s largest cities are facing these constraints; \ncongestion in Beijing was found to cost the economy CNY72 billion ($10.7 billion) annually.6 \n \n6.  The Urumqi metropolitan area comprises nine cities: Changji, Fukang, Hutubi, Qitai, \nShawan, Shihezi, Turpan, Urumqi, and Wujiaqu.7 The population is 6.7 million people, and the \ngross domestic product growth in each city is 5.5%\u201311.1% annually. The area is linked by railways \nto six major domestic cities\u2014Beijing, Chengdu, Lanzhou, Shanghai, Xi'an, and Zhengzhou\u2014and \nthree  border  and  trade  cities  in  XUAR\u2014Alashankou,  Kashgar,  and  Khorgos,  bordering \nKazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic. The area is linked by expressway to these and several \nmore major cities in the PRC. Public transport and logistics in the area\u2019s cities (except Urumqi) \nand intercity linkages are underdeveloped. \n \n7.  To support increasing RCI, several projects for transport and trade and logistics have been \nannounced in the Urumqi metropolitan area; however, there has been limited planning and \ncoordination between government agencies. The current master plans were prepared in 2010 \nand thus do not account for the additional growth expected and lack focus on intercity connectivity \nwithin the Urumqi metropolitan area. Development of a strategy and action plan for transforming \nthe area into a transport and logistics hub, based on the expected growth, is necessary to optimize \nthe area\u2019s future development. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: (i) build a comprehensive transportation \nsystem that connects domestic and international transportation routes, extensively covers both \nurban and rural areas across regions, incorporates hubs with optimized functions, and provides \nintegrated, efficient services (footnote 2), and (ii) transformation of XUAR into a hub for transport, \ntrade and logistics, finance, culture, science and education, and medical services (footnote 4). \nThe TA will have the following outcome: transport and logistics strategies and plans for Urumqi \nmetropolitan area improved. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Output, Methods, and Activities  \n9.  Output  1:  Comprehensive  hub-oriented  transportation  strategy  for  Urumqi \nmetropolitan area completed. The strategy will include: (i) the desktop review and case studies \n                                                \n6 Wang, L., Xu, J. & Qin, P. 2014.

The output aims to strengthen planning, particularly the intercity linkages, across the \nUrumqi metropolitan area for (i) public transport and road network development with consideration \nof  transit-oriented  development  and  mode  and  route  preference;  and  (ii)  urban  logistics \ndevelopment with a focus on existing locations, potential for clustering and integration, multimodal \nconnectivity, and mode and route preference. The public and private sectors will be consulted \nthroughout the TA. The output will be disseminated digitally.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $880,000, of which $800,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The expenditure items are \nlisted in Appendix 2. \n \n12.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of professional and support \nstaff; a suitably furnished office with utilities and telecommunication access; materials, maps, \navailable data, and documents required by the TA; the cost of utilities (excluding telephone) for \nthe consultants; and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  ADB will administer the TA (Table 1). ADB will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants. \nThe Urumqi Urban Comprehensive Transport Research Center, as the executing agency, will be \nresponsible for guiding TA activities, coordinating government agencies and organizations, and \nreviewing and commenting on the consultant outputs. A working group of representatives from \neach of the cities in Urumqi metropolitan area will provide guidance to the consultant team. Up to \nfour workshops and one multi-stakeholder workshop will be held in Urumqi to review the TA \nresults and receive feedback from the expert panel.  \n \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  December 2017\u2013February 2019  \nExecuting agency  Urumqi Urban Comprehensive Transport Research Center \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB  \nQCBS with a quality\u2013 71 person-months  $800,000 \ncost ratio of 90:10  \nAsset turnover or disposal  When the TA is completed, the consultant will promptly turn over any \narrangement upon TA completion  purchased equipment to the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina.
