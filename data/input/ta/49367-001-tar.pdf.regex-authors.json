INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Georgia has  requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB)  to \nprovide policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) to enhance the planning of and the \npolicies  related  to  urban  areas  and  secondary  towns,  to  achieve  more  balanced  regional \ndevelopment. Strategic priorities will include inclusive economic growth, tourism development, \nand agribusiness.1 The development of livable urban areas with improved infrastructure and \nservices will realize Georgia\u2019s potential for sustainable urban development as identified in the \nGeorgia National Urban Assessment, 2016.2 The TA will help Georgia mainstream integrated \nurban  development  in  a  participatory  manner  by  masterplanning  and  prioritizing  urban \ninvestments  that  promote  the  development  of  inclusive,  environmentally  responsible,  and \neconomically  competitive  urban  clusters  and  economic  corridors  in  alignment  with  ADB\u2019s \nStrategy  2020  and  Urban  Operational  Plan,  2012\u20132020.3 The  TA  will  build  on  existing \noperations in urban transport and services to develop an investment pipeline. It will initiate a \nprogrammatic approach to urban operations in Georgia, as discussed with the government \nduring missions and in keeping with the concurrence reached on the impact, outcome, outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, costs, financing arrangements, and outline terms of reference.4 \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Located in the Southern Caucasus region at the crossroads of Asia and Europe, Georgia \nis an important node for regional trade flows. In 2016, Georgia had a population of 3.7 million, of \nwhom 57.2% lived in urban areas.6 ADB\u2019s Georgia National Urban Assessment, 2016 identified \nthe following key challenges and opportunities for realizing Georgia\u2019s urban potential: \n(i)  Unplanned urbanization and uneven spatial distribution of the population. \nGeorgia predominantly consists of small urban settlements and one large city, \nTbilisi,  where  almost  half  of  the  urban  population  lives.  Urban  growth  and \ndevelopment  has  been  uneven  and  unplanned,\u2014concentrated  in  the  Tbilisi-\nRustavi urban area, Kutaisi, and Batumi\u2014leading to disproportionate distribution \nin the national urban system. This affects the livability and economic growth of \nsecondary towns and villages. \n(ii)  Urban infrastructure and services. The lack of adequate basic infrastructure is \na key obstacle to improving the quality of life in urban areas. Challenges include \n(a) unreliable drinking water supplies; (b) insufficient sewerage and sanitation \nfacilities leading to the degradation of the natural environment and a poor quality \nof  life;  and  (c)  inadequate  housing,  open  spaces,  public  transport  systems \n(including intercity connections), and pedestrian facilities. The lack of access to \nwater in secondary towns particularly affects women, as they are responsible for \ncollecting, buying and fetching water for domestic use. \n                                                \n1 The TA is included as Preparing City/Regional Development Plans in ADB. 2015.

A coordination meeting with the government was held on 15 September \n2016. \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 19 September 2016. \n6  National Statistics Office of Georgia (Geostat) 2016. http://www.geostat.ge/index.php?action=page&p_id=152&lang \n  =eng. Georgia held a census in 2014 after 2002. Data for 2016 is based on the 2014 census. \n ", "2   \n(iii)  Urban  governance  and  institutions.  There  is  a  limited  capacity  for \nimplementing spatial planning and urban development mandates at both the \nnational  and  local  levels.  The  local  self-government  code  decentralized \ninfrastructure  planning  and  implementation  responsibilities  without \ncommensurate financial and human resources. Cities and towns are required to \nprepare or update master plans, but have insufficient funding and capacity to do \nthis. There are no clear procedures that aid citizens\u2019 right of participation in the \nurban  planning  process.  Although  more  women  are  participating  in  politics, \nwomen in Georgia remain underrepresented in decision- making. \n(iv)  Financial sustainability. Low rates of cost recovery and limited spending on \ninfrastructure  operation  and  maintenance  endanger  the  sustainability  of  the \ninfrastructure.7 Local  governments  depend  on  other  financial  sources  from \nnational ministries or the national companies established under these ministries \nfor capital investments. There is an opportunity to integrate financial sustainability \nin the planning and implementation of urban infrastructure projects. \n \n3.  Georgia\u2019s urban vision, as outlined in the Social-Economic Development Strategy of \nGeorgia (Georgia 2020), is to leverage its strategic location to become a logistics hub and \ndevelop regionally competitive, well-connected, and livable urban areas based on integrated \nurban planning through an inclusive and adaptive approach (footnote 6). This is consistent with \nADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Georgia, 2016\u20132018 and ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of \nStrategy 2020.8 The government\u2019s priority to support balanced regional development based on \ntourism and cultural heritage clusters requires the provision of adequate urban and tourism \ninfrastructure  in  the  towns  and  surrounding  villages  through  investment  planning  and \nmanagement. \n \n4.  The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Georgia, 2014\u20132018, \nwhich recommends developing municipal plans to make essential drinking water, sewerage, \nand sanitation services more accessible, reliable, and energy-efficient. It will also encourage \nsustainable  urban  transport,  including  low-carbon  mobility  and  mass  transport  systems, \nparticularly in secondary towns, which are potential agribusiness and tourism hubs (footnote 6). \nThe TA will provide the government with integrated urban planning and policy formulation \nsupport for the preparation of masterplans, policy recommendations, and a medium- to long-\nterm investment plan. This plan will prioritize projects that (i) address sector issues; (ii) address \ninstitutional, operational, and financial sustainability; and (iii) implement long-term, sustainable \ndevelopment goals for the urban areas. The projects prioritized for financing will be prepared \nand linked with follow-on investments such as a project design advance loan, which will fund \ndetailed engineering designs, cost estimates, bidding documents, and other relevant project \npreparatory activities for procurement-ready projects under ADB\u2019s proposed Sustainable Cities \nDevelopment Investment Program (footnote 7).  \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2014.

The TA will be aligned with the following impacts: (i) inclusive economic growth and \nimproved livability in the selected urban areas in Georgia; and (ii) cities and human settlements \nmade  inclusive,  safe,  resilient,  and  sustainable.9 These  are  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s \nSocial-Economic Development Strategy of Georgia (footnote 6) and Sustainable Development \nGoal 11.10 \n \n6.  The outcome will be capacity for integrated urban planning and management of livable \nurban areas enhanced. By addressing capacity issues, the TA will initiate support to address the \nlarger development problem of infrastructure deficits and the lagging economic growth of cities, \nsecondary towns, and urban areas. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The outputs and key activities of the TA are as follows: \n(i)  Integrated urban plans (IUPs) for selected cities, secondary towns, and urban \nareas  prepared  by  incorporating  economic  competitiveness,  inclusiveness, \nenvironmental  sustainability,  climate  change  resilience,  and  disaster  risk \nmanagement to improve the planning of urban infrastructure and services. A \u201cMy \nLivable  City\u201d  campaign  will  be  conducted  to  (a)  create  an  inclusive  and \nparticipatory vision for the urban area, and (b) sustain ownership of the ensuing \ninvestment  program.  Investments  will  be  prioritized,  using  a  multicriteria \neconomic  analysis,  to  lead  into  an  investment  loan.  Inclusive  urban  area \nguidelines for adapting the built environment for differently abled persons, senior \ncitizens, women, and children will be prepared to integrate gender concerns and \nuniversal design. \n(ii)  Urban  management  partnerships  (UMPs)  to  improve  core  planning  and \nmanagement competency identified. This output will include a capacity needs \nassessment, peer-to-peer learning activities, and knowledge products. \n(iii)  Institutional and financial sustainability mechanisms for the sustained provision of \nurban infrastructure. This output will include an assessment of municipal finances \nand the possible structuring of a model for resilient infrastructure finance facilities \nwithin  the  institutional  context  and  functioning  of  the  existing  Municipal \nDevelopment Fund of Georgia. The mobilization of new financing sources and \npartnerships\u2014such  as  development  charges  or  fees,  loans,  bonds,  carbon \nfinance,  value-capture  taxes  (impact  fees  and  tax-increment  financing),  and \npublic\u2013private investments\u2014will be reviewed to incentivize small and medium-\nsized enterprises. An institutional capacity assessment will review planning and \nimplementation capacity for the potential application of financing modalities, such \nas a sector project, financial intermediation, results-based lending, and/or results-\nbased lending with MFF, and its scope of operation.11 \n \n                                                \n9  To be selected subject to agreement with the government. \n10  United Nations. 2015.

New York.   \n11 The modalities were presented to and discussed with the Ministry for Regional Development and Infrastructure and \nMunicipal Development Fund of Georgia during the inception mission (29 January\u20139 February 2016) for the \nSustainable Urban Transport Investment Program, tranche 4 (Loan 3273-GEO). \n ", "4   \n8.  The TA will be conducted in three stages to align with the programmatic approach \noutlined in the flowchart in Supplementary Appendix A. In the first phase (through February \n2017), the TA team will collect basic data and liaise with the national government to develop a \nselection matrix of urban areas for the preparation of IUPs. During the second phase (February\u2013\nDecember  2017),  the  TA  team  will  prepare  the  IUPs  and  identify  UMPs.  The  team  will \ncollaborate with ADB\u2019s Economic Analysis and Operational Support Division to establish a \nvaluation  methodology  to  capture  co-benefits  from  multisector  urban  projects  to  prioritize \ninvestments  using  a  multicriteria  economic  analysis  and  the  city  infrastructure  investment \nprioritization programming tool kit. During the third phase (July 2017\u2013September 2018), the TA \nwill leverage parallel financing support from the Cities Development Initiative for Asia for the \nstudies for prioritized projects linking to investment loans.12 The team will leverage technical \nadvisory support from the Urban Sector Group to mobilize the centers of excellence in the cities \nif there is a matching and identified need.13 \n \n9.  The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, and it is assumed that the \nmultiple  agencies  involved  will  continue  their  political  commitment  and  support  for  the  TA \nactivities. Possible risks include a genuine lack of citizen interest in the urban planning process; \nhowever, international expertise will transfer knowledge and raise awareness during stakeholder \nconsultations. The TA will build on concepts and lessons from previous and ongoing ADB loans \nand TA projects, including the contextualized application of existing models of city development \nplans such as green city action plans, and linking to a follow-on investment program.14   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,010,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, domestic transportation for counterpart staff \nto attend stakeholder consultations and site visits, and other in-kind contributions.15 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n11.  The TA will be implemented from November 2016 to December 2018. The Ministry for \nRegional  Development  and  Infrastructure  (MRDI)  will  be  the  executing  agency.  ADB  will \nadminister the TA through the Urban Development and Water Division of the Central and West \nAsia Department. The government will set up a steering committee chaired by the MRDI to \nguide the TA. National government agencies and sub-agencies related to regional infrastructure \nand the delivery of urban services\u2014 the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economy and \nSustainable  Development,  the  Municipal  Development  Fund  of  Georgia,  the  United  Water \nSupply  Company  of  Georgia,  the  Roads  Department,  the  Georgia  National  Tourism \nAdministration, the National Agency for Cultural Heritage Preservation of Georgia, and local \ngovernments of selected cities, towns and urban areas\u2014will assign a senior staff member to the \nsteering committee. All members will report to the MRDI and will participate in the critical \n                                                \n12 This will include studies for cities or urban areas that focus on integrated water supply and sanitation, sustainable \nurban transport, and other urban infrastructure as identified during the prescreening process with the government. \nCity officials must apply to the Cities Development Initiative for Asia (CDIA) core management team for approval of \nthe funding based on their selection criteria. CDIA will administer its funds and recruit and supervise its consultants. \n13 ADB  has  signed  memorandums  of  understanding  with  several  centers  of  excellence  through  partnership \nagreements. The TA team will explore the potential for collaborating with the COEs with regard to identified needs \nas the TA progresses, and will coordinate with the Urban Sector Group and other focal points for the COEs. \n14 ADB. 2012.

The Urban Development and Water Division, ADB\u2019s Georgia Resident Mission, and \nthe  steering  committee  will  cooperate  with  nongovernment  organizations,  and  other \ndevelopment partners. \n \n12.  ADB will engage an international consulting firm using performance-based, quality- and \ncost-based  selection,  with  90:10  weightage  for  technical  and  financial  expertise.  The \nperformance-based  terms  of  reference  and  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  are \nappropriate for this complex and highly specialized assignment, as this enables consultants to \nsubmit  innovative  proposals  for  preparing  the  IUPs  considering  the  latest  tools  and \nmethodologies. This selection method is proposed due to the importance of specific technical \nskills  required  to  deliver  the  task,  including  the  complex  integration  of  urban  planning, \nenvironmental management, climate resilience, financial sustainability, and institutional capacity \ndevelopment. The firm\u2019s consulting inputs include international (25 person-months) and national \nspecialists  (40  person-months)  to  carry  out  the  TA  activities  (Appendix  3).  The  proposing \nentities will determine the number and nature of the experts that they require to achieve the \ncontract objectives in accordance with their proposed approach and methodology. ADB needs \nat least four key international experts, one of whom will act as team leader; these will include (i) \nan urban and regional planner, (ii) an urban economist, (iii) an environmental engineer and \nclimate change specialist, and (iv) a social development and gender specialist.  \n \n13.  Additionally, a senior urban policy specialist (international independent, 5 person-months) \non urban finance and governance will recommend infrastructure financing mechanisms. An \nurban development researcher (international independent, 8 person-months) will coordinate the \nTA outputs and coordinate with key divisions within ADB and other agencies to achieve cross-\nsector synergies. International experts (5 person-months) will be engaged through the Centers \nof Excellence to conduct activities for peer-to-peer learning under the UMP. These individual \nconsultants will be recruited using individual consultants selection. A suitable nongovernment \norganization,  noncommercial  entity,  or  consulting  firm  will  be  engaged  using  consultants\u2019 \nqualifications selection, based on highly specialized expertise and previous project experience, \nto develop the inclusive urban area guidelines in collaboration with the consulting team.  ADB \nwill engage the consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, \nas amended from time to time). The TA proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n14.  The TA will finance (i) knowledge products and regional knowledge-sharing events, (ii) \nside events at regional conferences, and (iii) the participation of staff and government officials to \ndisseminate  good  practices  and  lessons  learned  through  the  implementation  of  the  TA  in \ncollaboration  with  the  Urban  Sector  Group  and  other  groups  within  the  Sustainable \nDevelopment  and  Climate  Change  Department.  The  TA  will  be  evaluated  once  all  stated \nactivities have been completed and the outcome is achieved. Livable urban area citizens\u2019 \nscorecards  will  be  proposed  as  a  sustainable  monitoring  mechanism  to  enable  local \ngovernments to monitor quality-of-life indicators, subject to government agreement and citizen \ninterest. Community-based organizations and women's groups will be invited to help develop \nthe criteria for scoring and mobilizing the citizen\u2019s feedback mechanism. \n \nIV.
