THE PROPOSAL \n \n  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the third additional financing of the Small and \nMedium-Sized  Enterprises  Line  of  Credit  Project.  The  report  also  describes  the  proposed \nadministration of a grant to be provided by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) for the \nthird additional financing and the proposed administration of technical assistance (TA) to be \nprovided by the JFPR for Value Chain Development for Tea Sector, and if the Board approves \nthe proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the \nadministration of the grant and the TA. \n \n  To promote financial inclusion of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Sri Lanka, \nwhich is a key development priority for the government to reduce unemployment and regional \ninequalities, and provide immediate financial support to severely affected SMEs in response to \nthe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the third additional financing will scale up and \nchange the scope of the project to (i) expand and deepen the banks\u2019 outreach to underserved \nSMEs, including businesses led by women and tea smallholders; and (ii) provide affordable \nworking capital loans to severely affected SMEs to support their business continuity and recovery. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n  The project was originally approved by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Board of \nDirectors on 15 February 2016 with a loan and TA to strengthen access to finance by SMEs, \nwhich account for more than 45% of total employment and 52% of gross domestic product.1 The \nproject prioritizes continued support for women-led businesses and export-oriented industries in \nSri Lanka to address the chronic issues of women\u2019s low level of economic participation and the \ndeclining international competitiveness of traditional industries, such as tea.2 \n \n  The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka promptly imposed \nsocial distancing and containment measures in March 2020, which helped curb the spread of the \nvirus in the country\u2014recording zero community transmission since 1 May 2020. However, the \ncountry saw sudden spikes in COVID-19 cases in early October 2020. The total number of people \nwho had tested positive for COVID-19 sharply increased from 3,402 as of 4 October 2020 to \n12,570 as of 6 November 2020.3 To control the spread of the new wave, the government \nreintroduced stricter social distancing measures and imposed curfew in some areas of the country \nincluding Colombo and two other districts in Western Province, which is the center of economic \nactivity in the country.  \n \n  In terms of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, tourism and other export-\noriented industries were the first to be severely affected since early 2020 because of a sharp \ndecline in global demand and supply chain disruptions, which led to an economic slowdown that \ngradually spread across a wide range of sectors and were deteriorated through the social \ndistancing and containment measures. SMEs face serious challenges to their survival because \n \n1  Government of Sri Lanka, Ministry of Industry and Commerce. 2016. National Policy Framework for Small Medium \nEnterprise Development.

As of 6 November 2020, out of 12,570 confirmed \ncases, 6,623 were recovered, 29 died, and 5,918 patients undergo hospital treatment.  \n ", "2 \nof lack of resources and bargaining power. They urgently need financial support to (i) mitigate \nbusiness disruptions and retain employment, and (ii) take precautionary measures for a possible \nprolonged economic slowdown. The government has been prioritizing its support to SMEs given \ntheir large presence and vulnerability to external shocks.4 The recent surge in COVID-19 cases \nhas induced urgency in the government support for SMEs.    \n \n1.  Progress of Ongoing Project \n \n  Original project. The original loan of $100 million, financed from ADB\u2019s regular ordinary \ncapital resources (OCR), became effective on 27 April 2016.5 This was a financial intermediation \nloan allocated to 10 participating financial institutions (PFIs) for eligible SME subprojects. The \noriginal loan demonstrated quick disbursements, exceeding development targets (Table 1), and \nimproved access to finance for targeted SMEs.6 The original loan was closed on 10 January 2019 \nwith full deployment, 1.5 years earlier than the initial plan. \n \n  First and second additional financing. An additional $75 million loan, financed from \nADB\u2019s OCR (the first additional financing, the second loan), and a $9.5 million grant from the \nWomen Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative (We-Fi) (the second additional financing) were approved \nin 2018.7 The additional loan scaled up the original project size and the additional grant has \nenhanced women entrepreneurs\u2019 access to risk capital. The We-Fi grant was cofinanced with \nADB\u2019s second loan to provide 20%\u201335% principal paydown for eligible SME borrowers led by \nwomen under ADB\u2019s line of credit (We-Fi financing scheme). The additional loan and grant have \nbeen performing well, with the sharp increase in the number of SME borrowers led by women \n(Table 1) partly because of the We-Fi grant provisions of $6.46 million to 658 SMEs led by women. \n \nTable 1: Achievements of Development and Disbursement Targets \n1st Loan  2nd Loan \n(July 2016\u2013 (July 2018\u2013\nItem  Development Target  Jan 2019)  Sep 2020) \nAllocated amount ($ million)    $100.0  $75.0 \nLoan provision ($ million)    $100.0  $73.8 \nNo. of beneficiaries    1,755  1,774 \nTargeted beneficiaries (% to total)       \nNo. of SMEs led by women  Initially 5% and raised to 20%  27.6%  47.7% \nNo. of first-time borrowers  Initially 10% and raised to 20%  26.8%  27.1% \nAmount of targeted SMEsa   Initially 50% and raised to 70%  91.4%  92.9% \nSMEs = small and medium-sized enterprises. \na   Targeted SMEs are defined as SMEs that are (i) located outside of Colombo District, (ii) borrowing for working capital \nthat is not collateralized by fixed or financial assets, (iii) led by women, or (iv) first-time borrowers from a licensed \ncommercial or specialized bank.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n \n4  Impact Assessment of COVID-19 on Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Finance (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n5  ADB. 2016.

A $2.0 million TA grant for Cluster \nDevelopment and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Finance Innovation from the JFPR was \nattached to the original loan to (i) propose innovative SME financing schemes, such as cluster-\nbased lending and the creation of an SME credit guarantee institution; and (ii) enhance the \ncapacity of SMEs led by women in export-oriented clusters. An increase to the attached TA in the \namount of $2.2 million, financed from the We-Fi (We-Fi TA components), was approved in June \n2018 to enhance the project\u2019s overall gender dimensions. The TA related outputs are on track.8 \n \n  Experience and lessons from the ongoing project. Under the ongoing project, PFIs \nhave begun to mainstream their SME operations and reach out to underserved SMEs. The \nongoing project has also incentivized eight PFIs to introduce an ADB-compliant environmental \nand  social  management  system  (ESMS)  (para.  44).  A  unique  fund  allocation  mechanism \nencouraged 10 PFIs to meet the disbursement and development targets (para. 32). A robust \nproject monitoring system developed a detailed dataset for 2,845 subloans as of June 2019, \nwhich enabled evidenced-based policy formation.9 \n \n  The ongoing project has demonstrated positive impacts for the development of women \nentrepreneurship with 37.7% of the SME subborrowers being led by women (para. 7). Training \nfor women under the ongoing TA has evolved to provide handholding business development \nsupport and encourage SMEs led by women to explore financial options. To ensure sustainability \nand promote scale-up, banks\u2019 operations and government institutions\u2019 support should be further \nupgraded to meet the unique demands and requirements of SMEs led by women through the \nimplementation of the ongoing We-Fi TA components. \n \n  Eligibility for additional financing. The ongoing project has been performing well and \nhas been rated on track since its approval. The ongoing project (i) remains technically feasible, \neconomically viable, and financially sound; (ii) is accorded high priority by the government; and \n(iii) is consistent with the current project\u2019s development objectives, the government\u2019s priorities, \nand ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, which prioritizes expanding access to finance for SMEs \nand  promoting  gender  equality.10 The  ongoing  project  is  compliant  with  safeguard  policy \nrequirements, and its overall safeguard implementation is rated satisfactory. The delivery of \nexpected outputs and the management of risks are rated successful (footnote 8). \n \n2.  Proposed Third Additional Financing \n \n  Given the good performance of the ongoing project, the government has requested a third \nadditional financing to scale up and introduce certain changes to the existing project to (i) fund \nimmediate working capital needs of SMEs in response to COVID-19, and (ii) enhance the access \nto long-term financing by underserved SMEs (such as SMEs led by women and tea smallholdings) \nto support economic recovery and transformation. The third additional financing of $166.25 million \nwill be delivered through 3 components under output 1: (i) a $45 million SME credit line (SME \ncomponent) for deepening the SME finance ecosystem and promoting women entrepreneurship, \n(ii) a $21.25 million affordable credit facility for promoting financial inclusion of strategically \n \n8  Summary  of  Project  Performance;  and  Progress  of  Grant  and  Technical  Assistance  Funded  by  Women \nEntrepreneurs Finance Initiative (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9  Evaluation of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Line of Credit Project (2016\u20132019) (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2).  \n10 ADB. 2017.

The continuation of ADB\u2019s credit line will accelerate the \nPFIs\u2019 transformation toward sustainable banking and, in turn, encourage growth-oriented SMEs \nto embark on business expansion. The continuation of the We-Fi financing scheme for SMEs led \nby  women  will  be  promoted  under  an  upgraded  government  policy  framework  for  women \nentrepreneurship development (paras. 8 and 10).12 The eligibility criteria for subprojects of the \nSME  component  and  We-Fi  financing  scheme  have  been  reconsidered  for  more  targeted \ninterventions, with more effective utilization of ADB\u2019s long-term financing and the remaining \n$2.95 million We-Fi grant (paras. 32 and 35). \n \n  Pilot component: Support for tea smallholders. Among various export-oriented sectors \nin Sri Lanka, the tea industry has been an important part of the socioeconomic fabric. It accounts \nfor 15% of exports and employs 10% of the workforce, most of whom are less educated with \nchronically  low  income.  Some  75%  of tea  production  depends  on  more than  400,000  tea \nsmallholders, defined as tea farmers with landholdings of no greater than 20.2 hectares (50 \nacres). Most tea smallholders are engaged in informal family businesses. Despite its brand \nrecognition, Sri Lankan tea has recently been losing its international competitiveness because of \nthe declining quality and quantity of tea leaves resulting from underinvestment.13 Tea bushes are \naged without regular replanting. The current replanting rate of the tea smallholding segment is \nonly 0.7%, while the ideal rate is 2%\u20133%. Technological upgrading in agricultural practices, \nincluding climate change adaptation, is low. The underinvestment by tea smallholders is caused \nby (i) their limited access to long-term financing to match their yield curve;14 (ii) their limited access \nto training, technology, and markets; and (iii) ineffective enabling policy frameworks. To address \nthese issues, the affordable credit facility will support tea smallholders\u2019 new investments, which \nwill  be  complemented  by  a  new  attached  TA  (paras.  38\u201339)  for  developing  an  enabling \nenvironment for the tea industry. \n \n  Emergency response component: Support for small and medium-sized enterprises \naffected by COVID-19. SMEs are more vulnerable in times of economic downturn because they \n(i) are too small to downsize, (ii) are less diversified in their economic activities, (iii) have lower \ncapitalization and working capital buffers, and (iv) experience a lack of various financing options. \nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, banks are trying to ease SMEs\u2019 financial conditions by \nrestructuring their SME loans and extending moratoriums for SME debt repayments until 31 \nMarch 2021, following a series of guidelines from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) since \nJanuary 2020 (footnote 4). Despite SMEs\u2019 acute financing demands for business continuity, banks \nface difficulty in (i) lowering their lending rates to a level that would be affordable to SMEs in the \ncurrent environment, owing to the banks\u2019 higher cost of funds; and (ii) providing new loans, owing \n \n11 The $21.25 million pilot component will include a $1.25 million attached grant from the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction to be administered by ADB. Please refer to Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction Grant (accessible from the \nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n12 Another TA project funded by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) has a component to evaluate the \neffectiveness of government development financial schemes. ADB. 2019. Technical Assistance to Sri Lanka for \nEnhancing Rural Micro and Small-Sized Enterprises Finance. Manila (TA 9711-SRI). \n13 Sri Lanka\u2019s share (amount) in world tea exports dropped from 19.4% during 2001\u20132005 to 12.9% during 2014\u20132018. \nInternational Trade Center. International Trade Statistics, 2001\u20132020 (accessed 31st August 2020). \n14 It takes 2\u20133 years for soil rehabilitation and another 18\u201336 months for tea bushes to yield pluckable tea leaves. \nThereafter, productivity increases up to about the age of 8 years. Yield stays fairly stable until the age of 40\u201350 years, \nthen the productivity starts declining rapidly and becomes less resilient to extreme weather events.  \n ", "5 \nto  the  deteriorating  liquidity  position  experienced  by  banks  following  the  moratoriums  on \nunderlying client loan repayment. \n \n  In late March 2020, the CBSL announced a new SLRs50 billion concessional financing \nscheme for all SMEs and large enterprises in tourism and other export-oriented sectors to cover \n2 months of their obligatory expenses, such as salary payments. The CBSL scheme was \nexpanded to SLRs150 billion in June 2020, out of which SRLs133 billion were benefitted by \n45,582 businesses as of 15 October 2020 (footnote 4). While the CBSL scheme mainly supports \nthe survival of a wide range of enterprises by refinancing a narrow scope of eligible expenditures, \na more targeted approach is needed to provide adequate liquidity for SMEs, some of which may \nnot have sufficient fixed assets for collateral, to restart their businesses. \n \n  This situation will likely lead to the following negative consequences. In the short term, \n(i) banks will incur losses from provisioning of increased nonperforming loans and from voluntary \ninterest concession to SMEs; and (ii) SMEs without sufficient revenue will accumulate a high-\ninterest debt burden, cannot roll over existing loans, and become insolvent. In the medium term, \nthere is a risk that the banks\u2019 decreased lending capacity could weaken financial intermediation, \nwhich would hinder economic recovery and transformation. To address the short-term issues, the \nERC will establish an affordable short-term financing facility in December 2020. To address the \nmedium-term risk, the repayments from the ERC will be reallocated to the SME component and/or \nthe pilot component from 2022 (para. 28) for providing long-term financing to underserved SMEs. \n \n  ADB\u2019s  continued  long-term  engagement  through  these  three  components,  with  the \nongoing and new TA projects, will ensure a holistic approach to effectively evolve an overall SME \nfinance ecosystem based on the foundation developed under the ongoing project (paras. 6\u201310).15 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n  The project is aligned with the following impact: employment opportunities for SMEs \nincreased.16 The project will have the following outcome: SMEs\u2019 access to finance strengthened.17 \n \n  The project\u2019s impact and outcome statements are unchanged as a result of the additional \nfinancing. However, as illustrated in the revised design and monitoring framework, each of the \nthree credit lines delivered under the third additional financing and the attached JFPR TA \nestablish revised and new outcome indicators, which reflect their respective targeted objectives. \n \nC.  Outputs  \n \n  The outputs of the overall project will remain the same, with the exception of a minor \nrevision in the output 4 statement. The third additional financing will scale up and expand the \nscope under outputs 1, 3, and 4 of the overall project (paras. 22\u201324). Outputs 2, 5, and 6 will be \nretained.  \n \n  Output  1:  Financing  to  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  through  formal \nintermediaries increased. The SME component will scale up and refocus the ongoing project \nby delivering additional financing to support the credit line to SMEs to address their long-term \n \n15 ADB\u2019s sector experience and planned future assistance are in Sector Assessment (Summary): Finance (Small and \nMedium-sized Enterprise Finance) (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 Government of Sri Lanka. 2017.

The pilot \ncomponent will introduce a new credit line that provides long-term and low-cost funding to \npromote capital investments by tea smallholders. The ERC will also be introduced to provide a \nquick-disbursing and affordable working capital credit line to SMEs affected by the COVID-19 \npandemic. \n \n  Output 3: Capacity of small and medium-sized enterprises in targeted clusters to \naccess financial services enhanced. To strengthen the financial literacy of tea smallholders \nand ensure the accessibility of the new credit line targeting tea smallholders, the attached JFPR \nTA will develop customized solutions for financial products, a business management training and \nmobile application platform. Further, the ERC will promote the preparation of financial records by \nSMEs. \n \n  Output 4: International competitiveness of the information and communication \ntechnology\u2013business process outsourcing and tea clusters strengthened. In the context of \nexport promotion as key agenda of the ongoing project, the attached JFPR TA will support \ndeveloping a policy framework for a sustainable and gender-sensitive tea value chain. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n  The ongoing project was estimated to cost $185.17 million. The third additional financing \nwill consist of a regular loan of $165 million from ADB\u2019s OCR and a grant from the JFPR, \nadministered by ADB, of $1.25 million.

Manila (Grant 0574-SRI). \nb   Administered by the Asian Development Bank.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n  The government has requested a regular loan of $165 million from ADB\u2019s OCR to help \nfinance the project. The loan will have an annual interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of \n0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project \nagreements.  The  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  6  semiannual  tranches,  corresponding  to  the \nsemiannual fund allocation schedule, where (i) the $45 million under the SME component are \n ", "7 \nexpected to be disbursed through 3 equal semiannual tranches from April 2021, (ii) the $20 million \nunder the pilot component are expected to be disbursed in 5 equal semiannual tranches from \nApril 2021, and (iii) the $100 million under the ERC will be disbursed in a single tranche upon loan \neffectiveness to promptly meet the liquidity needs of SMEs. Each tranche will have a 10-year term \nand a disbursement-linked bullet repayment. Based on the bullet repayment method, the average \nmaturity is 10.95 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. \n \n  The government will relend the local currency equivalent to PFIs. The government will \nassume the foreign exchange risk. The loans from the government to PFIs under the SME \ncomponent and the pilot component will have 10-year tenors and bullet repayments that mirror \nthe government\u2019s repayments to ADB. For the ERC, the tenor will be up to 3.5 years with straight-\nline repayments, including a 12-month or longer grace period, to enable PFIs\u2019 affordable short-\nterm subloans to SMEs affected by COVID-19. For the SME component, the relending rate will \nbe at the banking industry\u2019s average weighted deposit rate. For the pilot component and the ERC, \nthe relending rate will be at the LIBOR plus 1.5% in the local currency.18 The PFIs will determine \nthe subproject loan terms based on the nature of the subprojects.  \n \n  By June 2022, the government will submit a proposal to reallocate the repayment from the \nERC to the SME component and/or pilot component for ADB\u2019s approval. The terms and conditions \nof recycled lending by the government to PFIs will follow those of applicable components. \n \n  The project can achieve a leveraging effect given the ADB\u2019s loan proceed will be revolved \nunder the SME component and the emergency component as described in Table 3. The combined \neffect is that ADB\u2019s $340 million will support $1,092 million in total expenditure by SMEs. \n \nTable 3: Estimated Leveraging Effect \n($ million) \nADB   PFI   SME Equity \nItem  Loan  Subloansa  Contributionb  Total \nOngoing project  175.00  350.00  188.46  538.46 \nSME component  45.00  90.00  48.46  138.46 \nPilot component  20.00  20.00  10.77  30.77 \nEmergency response component  100.00  250.00  134.62  384.62 \n  Total  340.00  710.00  382.31  1,092.31 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PFI = participating financial institution, SMEs = small and medium-sized \nenterprises. \na  For the ongoing project and the SME component, PFIs can reuse the funds twice during the 10-year borrowing \nperiod as the average duration of an SME loan in the current project is 5 years. For the pilot component, most \nsubloans are expected to have a tenor of 7\u201310 years, which makes the recycling unfeasible. For the emergency \nresponse component, the reflow of the short-term working capital financing will be recycled for the second and \nthird round of loan provisions (either short-term working capital financing or capital investments) to SMEs. \nb  Subborrowers are expected to contribute on average 35% equity to the subprojects, which will be partially covered \nby the We-Fi grant for SMEs led by women and the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction grant for tea smallholders. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n  Climate adaptation is estimated to cost $7.69 million, of which ADB will finance $5.00 \nmillion, the attached JFPR grant will finance $1.25 million and tea smallholders will finance the \nremainder.  The  climate  change  adaptation  cost  is  estimated  based  on  the  smallholders\u2019 \n \n18 Tea smallholders usually require a single digit borrowing rate because of uncertainty in investment returns and the \nrisk of overindebtedness. Affordable subloans will be needed since, under the ongoing project, only one out of \n2,845 subloans as of June 2019 were given to tea smallholders cofinanced with the We-Fi grant. \n ", "8 \ninvestments,  which  will  be  financed  under  the  pilot  component  to  address  climate-related \nproduction risks such as floods, drought, or landslides.19 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will continue to be the executing agency. The Department \nof Development Finance of the MOF will be the implementing agency for the entire project and \nthe Ministry of Plantation (MPI) will be the implementing agency for the pilot component. Subject \nto continued satisfactory performance, the 10 existing PFIs are expected to remain in the project. \n \n  The  SME  and  pilot  components  will  follow  the  ongoing  competitive  fund  allocation \nmechanism.  To  qualify  for  a  subsequent  semiannual  funding  round,  the  PFIs  must  meet \n(i) development targets for the SME component, and (ii) disbursement targets for both the SME \nand pilot components, within 5 months from the previous fund allocation.20 Eligible SMEs will be \nnarrowed down to targeted SMEs (footnote 6) in the productive sectors.21 \n \n  The ERC will allocate funds to PFIs on a first-come, first-served basis. Its maximum \nsubloan size is SLRs10 million to prioritize smaller businesses. PFIs must onlend 20% of the \nnumber of subloans against which fixed or financial assets are not pledged as collateral (non-\ncollateralized working capital loans). SME subborrowers will be required to submit financial \nrecords regularly during their 3-year borrowing period, which enables the government to evaluate \nthe effectiveness of the ERC and encourage banks to mainstream cash flow-based lending.22 \n \n  Attached Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction grant. The proposed new $1.25 million \nJFPR grant for enhancing tea smallholders\u2019 productivity under the pilot component will be \nadministered by ADB. The grant will provide a 10% principal paydown to a subloan for replanting \nor new planting by marginal tea smallholders (with landholding of less than 4.0 hectares [10 \nacres]), who are relatively poor and severely constrained by limited access to equity. The \nadditional grant of up to 10% of the total subloan will be provided for those tea smallholders who \nhave completed a qualified financial literacy training and prepared accurate business records. \n \n  Changes to ongoing Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative grant project. The \nremaining $2.95 million We-Fi grant continues to be available for SMEs led by women for the \nSME component, but will require changes in the implementation arrangement. The We-Fi grant \nwill be extended to 31 December 2022 to accommodate 3 additional semiannual allocations and \na winding-up period.23 The terms and conditions of the grant will also be revised to reduce the \ninitial principal paydown of eligible subloans from the current 20% of the total subloan size to 10%, \nso as to increase the number of beneficiary SMEs led by women and facilitate a smooth transition \nto market-based financing upon the completion of the We-Fi grant.24 Further, the maximum \n \n19 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 Currently, the disbursement target is 80% and the development targets are in Table 1. Under the SME component, \nthe development targets on SMEs led by women and first-time borrowers will be retained. The target on the first-time \nborrowers will be waived for the first allocation expected in December 2020, given the current market environment. \n21 Productive sectors are defined as the real sectors of the economy, excluding wholesale and retail trade operations \nand leasing and rental businesses. \n22  To incentivize PFIs to exceed the 20% target, more reflow from the repayments will be allocated to PFIs that have \nprovided non-collateralized working capital loans in larger number and amount (para. 28). \n23 Subject to approval by the We-Fi Governing Committee. \n24 The 10% additional principal paydowns available for SMEs led by women who have completed trainings and/or the \n5% for those in lagging areas (Uva, Sabaragamuwa, Western, and Northern provinces) will be retained. The \ndisbursement of the We-Fi grant has been increasing to date, so the 10% principal paydown is found to be adequate. \n ", "9 \nsubloan size for the We-Fi finacing scheme will be lowered from SLRs50 million to SLRs30 million \nto prioritize small and nascent women entrepreneurs. \n \n  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual (PAM).25 The project management unit (PMU) at the MOF will \nmonitor these targets, subproject eligibility, safeguards, and other matters to ensure compliance \nof the loan agreement. \n \nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \nSME Component and \nComponent  Emergency Response Component  Pilot Component \nBeneficiaries  Targeted SMEs in productive sectors (SME);  Tea smallholders \nSMEs in productive sectors (emergency \nresponse) \nADB loan (new)  $45 million (SME)  $20 million \n$100 million (emergency response) \nJFPR grant (new)  Not available  $1.25 million \nWe-Fi grant (ongoing)  $2.95 million   Not available \nImplementation period  November 2020\u2013March 2024 \nEstimated completion date  31 March 2022  30 September 2023 \nEstimated loan closing date  31 March 2024 \nManagement   \n(i)  Oversight body  Steering committee \nSecretary or deputy secretary of the Treasury (chair)  \nDepartment of Development Finance of MOF; Department of External Resources; \nMinistry of Plantation; Central Bank of Sri Lanka; Cabinet ministry in charge of SME \ndevelopment; National Enterprise Development Authority; Federation of Chambers of \nCommerce and Industry; and ADB (members) \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Finance \n(iii)  Implementing  Department of Development Finance  Department of Development Finance \nagencies  and Ministry of Plantation \n(iv)  Implementation unit  Project management unit, under the leadership of the Department of Development \nFinance with support from the Ministry of Plantation \nConsulting services  Loan and grant proceeds will not finance consulting services. \nProcurement  Procurement in subloans will be in accordance with the Procurement Regulations for \nADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time), and relevant ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Staff Instructions (2020, as amended from time to time).

ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n  The TA for value chain development for tea sector is estimated to cost $1.75 million, which \nwill be financed on a grant basis by the JFPR.26 It aims to improve tea smallholders\u2019 productivity \nand international competitiveness through (i) training for tea smallholders and selected PFIs; (ii) \n \n25 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nthe pilot launch of mobile application platform to strengthen value chain linkages and make public \nservice  delivery  efficient,  such  as  providing  extension  services;27 (iii) the  formulation  of  an \nenabling  policy  framework  to  promote  sustainable  and  gender-responsive  value  chain \ndevelopment; and (iv) project monitoring and evaluation. \n \n  The  executing  agency  for  the  TA  is  the  MPI.  The  implementing  agencies  are  the \nDepartment of Development Finance, the Tea Small Holdings Development Authority, Sri Lanka \nTea Board, and the MPI. ADB will administer the TA. It will recruit consultants and carry out the \nprocurement of goods and services associated with TA activities in accordance with the ADB \nProcurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  government  will  provide \ncounterpart support in the form of office accommodation, remuneration of the PMU and other \nstaff, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n  The project is economically and financially viable.28 Economically, it will (i) meet the urgent \nfinancing needs of SMEs affected by COVID-19 and (ii) promote the PFIs\u2019 mainstreaming of their \nSME operations. Financial support for unbanked businesses led by women and tea smallholders \nthrough We-Fi and JFPR grants will have positive economic externalities. Financially, the PFIs \nwill assess the credit risk of each subproject. The 10 PFIs are financially sound, given their \ncompliance with the stringent regulatory capital and liquidity requirements under Basel III, which \nwill ensure their resilience to external shocks including COVID-19. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n  ADB\u2019s financial management assessment and integrity due diligence on the government \nand each PFI indicate moderate risk. The PFIs are well-regulated, have established mature \nfinancial management systems, and have demonstrated good performance under the ongoing \nproject. Mitigating measures include (i) frequent monitoring of subprojects by ADB and the PMU, \nand (ii) briefings to PFIs on reporting and audit requirements following ADB\u2019s applicable policies \nand  their  strict  enforcement.  With  these  measures,  the  overall  financial  management \narrangements are considered adequate. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwas  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  the  MOF.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social  \n \n  The ongoing project has been overcoming regional disparities in income and gender \ninequality in employment. The third additional financing will enhance its project outcome by \n(i) expanding  and  deepening  support  to  SMEs  led  by  women  and  tea  smallholders,  and \n(ii) providing short-term working capital to SMEs in response to COVID-19.29 The third additional \nfinancing is categorized effective gender mainstreaming, as it will continuously promote a gender-\n \n27 The Colombo Tea Auction switched to an online platform in April 2020 as a countermeasure against the COVID-19 \npandemic. ADB\u2019s support for value chain development with digital solutions will push this emerging innovative trend \nforward. \n28 Economic Analysis and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 While COVID-19 affects all SMEs irrespective of gender, the project will ensure that SMEs led by women in remote \nareas are aware of the ERC, given that they have limited access to information. \n ", "11 \nresponsive business environment. The gender action plan will be updated to reflect the additional \ngender-related indicators under the three components and the new JFPR TA.30 \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n  Following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project will continue to be \nclassified financial intermediary for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous \npeoples. The project complies with ADB\u2019s information disclosure and consultation requirements. \nSubproject selection criteria will ensure that PFIs exclude SME subprojects with activities under \nADB\u2019s Prohibited Investment Activities List and with involuntary resettlement or indigenous \npeoples impacts.31 For the environment, PFIs without an approved ESMS must exclude all \nsubprojects with adverse environmental impacts (category A and B). These PFIs may only lend \nto subprojects that are included in an ADB-preapproved list of subprojects or that the PMU\u2019s \nsafeguard specialist has confirmed as category C for the environment; PFIs that have established \nan ESMS that complies with ADB\u2019s requirements and national laws (eligible ESMSs) may include \nsubprojects categorized B or C for environment, but must exclude subprojects with significant \nadverse environmental impacts (category A).32 \n \n  Safeguard due diligence concluded that eight PFIs have eligible ESMSs.33 ADB safeguard \nofficers have conducted semiannual site visits to subprojects and have not identified any material \nissues. ADB also conducted environmental safeguard training for all 10 PFIs. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n  The project\u2019s overall risk is low. Its benefits are expected to outweigh its costs. Major risks \nand mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail in the risk assessment \nand risk management plan.34 \n \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisk Description  Mitigating Measures \nRegulatory caps on lending rates  As COVID-19 fades and the economy becomes normalized, ADB will \nand mandatory loan repayment  continue to conduct policy dialogue with the government and recommend \nmoratorium for SMEs will  that these measures be temporary to avoid unintended distortions and \ndiscourage PFIs\u2019 lending.  inefficiencies in financial intermediation. \nMacroeconomic conditions  Under the IMF program during 2016\u20132019 and the ongoing ADB Capital \ndeteriorate because of COVID-19  Market Development Program, the government\u2019s capacity for \nand concern over external debt  macroeconomic management has been strengthened.
