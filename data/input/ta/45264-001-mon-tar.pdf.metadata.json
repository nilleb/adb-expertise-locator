INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Mongolia has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide technical assistance (TA) for capacity development in logistics. During the fact-finding \nmission in March 2012, ADB and the government reached an understanding on the impact, \noutcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, costs, financing arrangements, and terms of \nreference  for  consulting  services  for  the  TA.1 The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  As  a  landlocked  country,  Mongolia  must  rely  on  the  Russian  Federation  and  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for access to seaports. In the last 10 years, surging import and \nexport traffic has exceeded Mongolia\u2019s logistics capacity, both physical and managerial, causing \nsevere delays and excessive transport costs that increase the cost of products and services and \ninhibit economic development. Mongolia has only basic freight transport and handling services, \nas reflected in its overall logistics performance index ranking of 141 (1 is best and 155 is worst), \nindicating  that  logistics  is  underdeveloped  and  constrains  Mongolia\u2019s  competitiveness  and \neconomic development.2 \n \n3.  ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Mongolia cites high transit costs and low reliability \nof  logistics  chains  as  constraining  the  country\u2019s  competitiveness  and  limiting  regional \ncooperation.3 ADB\u2019s regional cooperation strategy and program update for the Central Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation initiative identifies multimodal transport as a strategic priority \nand the development of multimodal terminals as key interventions needing ADB support.4 \n \n4.  Ulaanbaatar is the main trade and transportation hub of Mongolia, its terminals handling \n95% of the nation\u2019s exports and imports. The growth of the mining industry, especially in the \nGobi region, will increase infrastructure development needs significantly. \n \n5.  Demand for freight transportation is driven by economic growth, with growth in imports \nclosely tracking growth in overall economic activity and import growth projections indicating the \nneed  for  improved  logistics.  The  economy  grew  by  17.3%  in  2011  driven  mainly  by \ninfrastructure spending related to mining activity. Imports surged owing to the equipment and \nmachinery needs of mining. The economy is forecast to continue growing at double digit rates, \n15% in 2012 and 17.5% in 2013,5 indicating a growing need for freight traffic handling and \nlogistics. Based on the past close link between economic growth and container traffic growth, it \nis expected that on average container traffic will grow by at least 15% to 20% per annum over \nthe next 10 years. \n \n6.  Demand for logistics facilities and warehouses is already very high in Ulaanbaatar, \nwhere existing freight terminals have no space for expansion. The city government plans to \nrelocate  all  freight  terminals  to  outlying  sites  and  reallocate  the  cleared  land  for  housing. \nRelocation will eliminate problems generated by excessive freight traffic in the city center.  \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 30 November 2011. \n2  World  Bank.  2011.

Manila. \n4  ADB. 2005. Central Asia Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program Update, 2006\u20132008: Development Through \nCooperation. Manila. \n5  ADB. 2012. Asian Development Outlook 2012: Confronting Rising Inequality in Asia. Manila. \n ", "2   \n7.  Mongolia\u2019s  logistics  industry  has  great  potential  for  development.  At  present,  no \nregulations govern freight forwarding. Constraints on truck access to terminals during the day, \nlogistics  terminals\u2019  lack  of  consolidation,  rapidly  deteriorating  infrastructure  and  material \nhandling equipment, and unreliable and poor service are some of the challenges facing the \nindustry. Multimodal cargo handling capacity in Ulaanbaatar is nearly saturated. Ineffective \nmultimodal container handling practices cause very slow container turnaround time and poor flat \nwagon  utilization.  Consequently,  freight  forwarders  incur  high  demurrage  charges,  which \ncontribute to Mongolia\u2019s high logistics cost. Railway and multimodal terminal operators urgently \nrequire assistance in adopting modern logistics management and introducing efficient container \ntransport and distribution techniques to address this escalating problem. \n \n8.  Until recently, ADB assistance for transport in Mongolia has largely been for the road \nsubsector. However, given the importance of logistics in the comprehensive development of the \ncountry\u2019s transport system, ADB is increasing its support in this area, mainly by supporting the \ndevelopment of two modern logistics terminals: (i) the logistics terminal at Zamyn-Uud under the \nADB-financed  Regional  Logistics  Development  Project,6 and  (ii)  the  integrated  multimodal \nlogistics facility in Ulaanbaatar (under preparation). \n \n9.  While these facilities will provide modern multimodal logistics infrastructure, government \ncapacity will need to be developed to ensure their efficient management and operationalization. \nThe proposed capacity development TA will improve the management of existing terminals and \noperations and enhance the utilization of their physical capacity. At present, the Ministry of \nRoads, Transportation, Construction, and Urban Development (MRTCUD), which has primary \nresponsibility for logistics in Mongolia, has very limited capacity for performing its responsibility \nfor logistics development. Ministry officials need training and capacity building to acquire the \nrequisite logistics management knowledge and skills. \n \n10.  Considerable  scope  exists  to  explore  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP)  in  logistics \ndevelopment and operations.7  International experience demonstrates that the private sector is \nmore efficient and client-oriented in delivering logistics services. Under PPP arrangements, \nprivate sector operators can become the providers of services, with responsibility for designing, \nbuilding, operating, and possibly financing the assets needed to deliver services. The role of the \ngovernment  agencies  in  the  public  sector  can  be  regulation,  performance  monitoring,  and \ncontract management. A Law of Mongolia on Concessions was passed by the Parliament of \nMongolia in January 2010 and has provided an initial basis for logistics development through \nPPP  models.8 The  government  has  little  experience  with  PPPs,  however,  so  it  will  need \nguidance and support in developing projects through PPP arrangements.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n11.  This is the first ADB TA intervention targeting logistics capacity development in Mongolia. \nThe TA will support logistics development, which will play a key role in the country\u2019s economic \ndevelopment. The premise of the TA is that enhanced capacity to develop efficient and effective \nlogistics infrastructure and services is needed to ensure sustained economic development. As \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Grant to \nMongolia for the Regional Logistics Development Project. Manila (Loan 2719-MON and Grant 0240-MON). \n7  PPP combines the public and private sectors to deliver a project or service traditionally provided by either the \npublic or the private sector. PPPs recognize that both the private and the public sector have certain advantages \nover the other, depending on the task. By assigning roles where each sector has a comparative advantage, public \nservices and infrastructure can be provided efficiently. \n8  Government of Mongolia. 2010. Law of Mongolia on Concessions. http://www.ppp.mn/ \n ", "  3\nthe government will continue in its policy and regulatory role supporting logistics development, \nenhancing its capacity is vital. The TA will support opportunities for private sector participation to \nenhance operational efficiencies in logistics.  \n \n12.  The TA will address the following areas: \n(i)  Institutional  strengthening.  The  TA  will  establish  a  dedicated  unit  under \nMRTCUD  to  guide  the  government  on  policy  and  regulatory  matters.  It  will \nexplore the potential for setting up an agency that has the authority to coordinate, \ndirectly  and  indirectly,  the  various  stakeholders  in  transport  and  logistics \ndevelopment, help streamline the approval of new initiatives, and provide a one-\nstop shop for advice, consultancy, and dispute resolution. \n(ii)  Partnering with the private sector. The TA will explore ways to encourage and \nincentivize private sector participation in the development of logistics facilities, \nincluding examining PPP models for developing logistics terminals, reviewing \ninternational experience in logistics policy and sector development, and providing \nguidance  and  support  for  the  government\u2019s  preparation  of  PPP  concession \nagreements.  \n(iii)  Building consensus. The TA will support training programs and workshops that \nwill allow transport and logistics stakeholders to discuss issues with experts and \ncome to a better understanding of possible logistics solutions for Mongolia. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact will be improved logistics performance of Mongolia. The outcome will be \nstrengthened capacity of MRTCUD for logistics sector planning, execution, and management. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA will have three outputs: (i) a dedicated logistics unit established under MRTCUD, \n(ii) PPP development and support for the implementation of the Ulaanbaatar Logistics Terminal, \nand (iii) a logistics database for Mongolia. \n \n15.  Output  1:  Logistics  unit.  Output  1  will  strengthen  the  management  capacity  of \nMRTCUD and its agencies for logistics development in Mongolia. Activities will cover all areas \nof logistics policy and infrastructure development and implementation, including  \n(i)  providing advice, support, and on-the-job training to government officials;  \n(ii)  developing an institutional plan for better interagency coordination;  \n(iii)  identifying priority reforms for improving logistics operations; and \n(iv)  directly  supporting  and  building  management  capability  in  the  project \nimplementation unit responsible for the Ulaanbaatar Logistics Terminal Project \nand subsequent projects. \n \n16.  Output  2:  Public\u2013private  partnership  capacity  building  and  opportunities  in \nlogistics. Output 2, in cooperation with the private sector, will help develop PPP opportunities in \nlogistics development in Mongolia. Activities will include \n(i)  developing  a  financing  strategy  for  attracting  private  sector  participation  in \nlogistics and the provision of logistics services; \n(ii)  providing advice for developing PPP concession agreements; \n(iii)  organizing PPP training for government officials; and \n ", "4   \n(iv)  convening two workshops, which will serve as platforms for brainstorming and \nexchanging ideas between policy makers and other stakeholders, including the \nprivate sector. \n \n17.  Output 3: Logistics database. Output 3 will create a logistics database that tracks \nlogistics and freight information. Activities will include \n(i)  establishing a logistics database that tracks traffic volume by mode, \n(ii)  using data to develop a national logistics strategy and priority project list, and  \n(iii)  assisting the government in screening project proposals for feasibility.   \n  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $900,000 and will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan \nFund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will provide counterpart \nsupport  in  the  form  of  suitably  furnished  offices  with  utilities;  telecommunications  access; \nmaterials, maps, data, and documents required by the TA; counterpart professional and support \nstaff; and other in-kind contributions. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  MRTCUD will be the executing agency. As the ministry responsible for road, rail, and air \ntransportation; construction; and urban development, it has been the executing agency for a \nnumber of ADB TA and investment projects. TA implementation will build on the experience and \nlessons gained from ongoing TA projects. A steering committee established by MRTCUD and \nchaired  by  the  state  secretary  will  guide  the  TA  and  monitor  its  progress.  Officials  from \nMRTCUD, the municipal government (the mayor\u2019s office), the City Planning Department, and \nUlaanbaatar Railway Company will be on the steering committee. Private sector participation on \nthe steering committee will be encouraged. \n \n20.  The TA will require 51 person-months of national and 14 person-months of international \nconsulting services. The terms of reference are in Appendix 3. ADB will engage individual \nconsultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time).  \n \n21.  Disbursement will follow ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). The TA will be implemented over 24 months, from 15 August 20129 \nto 15 August 2014. Equipment will be procured by the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time) and transferred to MRTCUD \nupon TA completion. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $900,000 to the Government \nof Mongolia to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for the \nLogistics Capacity Development, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n9  The delayed start date is owing to national elections in Mongolia scheduled on 28 June 2012. \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets  Data Sources and  Assumptions and Risks \nand Indicators  Reporting \nMechanisms \nImpact  By 2018:     Assumption \nImproved logistics  Improved logistics  Logistics performance  Government is able to secure \nperformance of  performance index  index website hosted  funding for the planned \nMongolia   from 2.25 in 2012  by the World Bank  investments in logistics sector \n   \nImproved logistics \nperformance ranking \nfrom 141 out of 155 \ncountries in 2012 \n \nOutcome  By 2015:    Assumption \nStrengthened  New sector institutional  MRTCUD reports  Participation of stakeholders \ncapacity of MRTCUD  structure implemented   and key government officials \nfor logistics sector  in the training workshops \nDedicated logistics unit \nplanning, execution,   \nfully operational in the \nand management  ministry   \n \n \nOutputs  By 2015:    Assumption \n1.
