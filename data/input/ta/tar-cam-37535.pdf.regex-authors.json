In 2000 as part of its ongoing efforts to improve policy regimes and build resettlement \ncapacity, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided regional technical assistance (TA) to six \ndeveloping  member  countries,  including  Cambodia.1  The  TA  prepared  a  draft  national \nresettlement policy for Cambodia and recommended that the draft policy be issued under the \nappropriate legal instrument and implemented by legal regulations using specified guidelines. In \naddition,  it  recommended  institutional  capacity  building.  ADB\u2019s  2003  Country  Programming \nConfirmation Mission confirmed funding for TA to fulfill these recommendations, and the proposed \nTA for Enhancing the Resettlement Legal Framework and Institutional Capacity2 was included in \nADB\u2019s Cambodia Country Program for 2004. The Fact-Finding Mission visited Cambodia from \n19\u201323 April 2004. In October 2004, the Mission and the Government reached an agreement on \nthe Executing Agency for the TA. The Government also agreed that as a result of the TA, (i) a \nregulatory agency would be designated that would be separate from the financing agency, (ii) line \nagencies would be responsible for resettlement planning and implementation, and (iii) transitional \narrangements  would  be  necessary  while  the  capacity  of  the  regulatory  and  implementing \nagencies is being strengthened.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Policy Issues. The main policy issues are Cambodia\u2019s lack of a national resettlement \npolicy and lack of a law on expropriation. The Constitution requires that the taking of land will only \nbe in the public interest, and that fair and just compensation must be paid in advance. As a direct \nresult of the lack of a national resettlement policy, nonformalized ad hoc procedures are used in \nthe resettlement process, and each resettlement varies, even when resettlement is caused by \nprojects funded by the same agency. Little or no effort has been made to address income \nrestoration issues in resettlement projects to date, and no support mechanisms have been put in \nplace for persons adversely affected by a project requiring resettlement.  \n \n3.  Procedural Issues. No legal framework exists for the valuation of assets, although the \nMinistry  of  Land  Management  Urban  Planning  and  Construction  (MLMUPC)  has  begun \npreparation of a subdecree on land valuation. Valuation is difficult, both as a practical matter \nand as a result of a lack of legal framework. This has resulted in unjustified variations in value \nplaced on structures and in nonindividualized compensation benefits as they are easier to \nadminister although not necessarily fair in practice. No valuation of nonland or other intangible \nassets, such as loss of livelihood, is attempted. Members of vulnerable groups have received \nonly limited additional financial compensation if they are affected by a resettlement project \nfunded by ADB or World Bank. Grievance redress mechanisms have not been put in place for \nmost resettlement projects, and when they have been, have not operated as planned.  \n \n4.  Institutional Issues. The most prominent institutional issue is the ad hoc arrangement \ncurrently in place for resettlement efforts. The Interministerial Resettlement Committee (IRC) was \nformed in 1998 at the request of ADB in the absence of any local experience to implement an \nADB-financed road project, and has taken the lead in all aspects of resettlement in Cambodia. \nThe IRC has a changing membership under the chair of the Ministry of Economy and Finance \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance for National Resettlement Policy Enhancement and Capacity Building. Manila. \nThe TA included follow-on work in the People\u2019s Republic of China, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, and Philippines; \nand initiated national resettlement policy development work in one new developing member country\u2014Cambodia. \n2  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 1 September 2003. ", "2    \n(MEF), and membership is newly constituted for each project requiring resettlement. Roles and \nresponsibilities  of  project  proponents  and  the  IRC  overlap,  resulting  in  unclear  lines  of \nresponsibility for resettlement, as implementation requires a complex interaction between MEF \n(the  IRC  chair),  the  implementing  ministerial  agency,  and  local  authorities.  Many  projects \nexperience significant implementation difficulties, and affected people have complained to the \nHuman Rights Commission. ADB is conducting a resettlement audit to investigate the complaints. \n \n5.  The role of nongovernment organizations (NGOs) has been limited, based on a lack of \ncapacity  and  misunderstandings  with  regard  to  their  rights  and  responsibilities  as  project \nmonitors. Monitoring and evaluation has only been performed in some projects and never for \nlong enough, and in no instance has it worked as envisioned. The Government has frequently \nbeen  uncooperative  with  these  monitoring  NGOs  by  withholding  required  documents  (i.e., \nrefusing to give them access to the very resettlement plan they were contracted to monitor), \nrefusing to make payments if it did not agree with the results, and budgeting the contract at such \na low level that adequate monitoring became difficult if not impossible. On at least one project, \nno action was taken by the IRC to investigate and resolve issues that had been reported by the \nmonitoring agency. In response, NGOs have formed their own resettlement action network to \nrespond to complaints from affected people and to initiate their own resettlement monitoring. \nLessons learned from the NGO experience have been incorporated into the TA. Resettlement \nproblems for ADB\u2019s projects in Cambodia are an accountability problem waiting to happen. \nResettlement is subject to the accountability mechanism and the continued failure of Cambodia \nto adhere to this policy requirement is a potential cause for a compliance review to be initiated. \n \n6.  Recommendations from the Regional TA. The key recommendations for Cambodia \nfrom the regional TA (footnote 1) include (i) promulgation of a national legal instrument for \nresettlement, implemented by legal regulations and with specified enforcement procedures, using \nspecified technical guidelines; (ii) permanent designated body to become the regulatory agency \nfor all resettlement activities, with the authority for policy oversight and monitoring, and separated \nfrom the financing and implementing agencies; and (iii) in-country training programs and annual \nrefresher  courses  in  resettlement  to  be  offered  to  relevant  stakeholders  or  representative \nstakeholders involved in any aspect of resettlement. \n \n7.  As a follow up to the recommendations, a draft national policy on resettlement was \nprepared and widely discussed during a national workshop held on 27 November 2001, and \nendorsed  by  key  stakeholders.  The  draft  policy  also  recommended  that  MLMUPC  be  the \nregulatory  agency  to  oversee  policy  implementation.  While  endorsement  of  this \nrecommendation was not fully obtained during the workshop, which was chaired by the IRC \nchairman, agreement was reached during TA processing that MLMUPC is the logical regulatory \nagency, and that oversight of the resettlement legal framework is within MLMUPC\u2019s mandate.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The  objectives  of  the  TA  are  to  help  the  Government  (i)  prepare  a  subdecree  on \ncompensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation for use when the state takes land owned or \noccupied  by  Cambodian  nationals  or  residents;  (ii)  formulate  complementary  implementing \nregulations and technical guidelines; and (iii) develop resettlement planning, implementation, \nfinancing,  monitoring,  and  compliance  enforcement  capacity.  The  policy,  subdecree,  and \ntechnical guidelines, which would be issued during the TA implementation, are intended both for \ninternationally and domestically financed investments, and will be consistent with ADB\u2019s and \n ", "      3\nWorld Bank\u2019s policies on involuntary resettlement, Government legislation, and lessons learned \nfrom past projects.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will comprise three phases. \n \n(i)  Phase  1  (approximately  6  months).  The  Government  will  be  assisted  in \nundertaking the necessary consultative processes to ensure broad stakeholder \nagreement on key principles of the policy, subdecree, implementing regulations, \nand technical guidelines. The draft national resettlement policy prepared under the \nregional TA (footnote 1) will be used as the basis for preparing the final policy, \nsubdecree, implementing regulations, and technical guidelines during this phase.  \n \n(ii)  Phase  2  (approximately  6  months).  The  draft  policy,  subdecree,  and \nimplementing regulations will be submitted to the Government for approval and \nwill be issued by the Prime Minister. The subdecree will designate an appropriate \nagency as the regulatory body for the subdecree. The designated regulatory \nagency and selected line agencies will establish and staff their resettlement \ndivisions.  A  training-needs  assessment  will  be  undertaken,  and  a  capacity-\nbuilding  and  dissemination  plan  and  training  materials  prepared  for \nimplementation during the TA and beyond. \n \n(iii)  Phase 3 (approximately 9 months). The new legal instruments and guidelines will \nbe disseminated widely and the training program will be initiated, including trials \nand tests of new materials and training approaches, and participatory monitoring \nand  evaluation  to  assess  results  attributable  to  the  training  programs  and \nperceived needs. Training will be focused on the designated regulatory agency; \nline  agencies;  provincial,  district,  and  local  staff  undertaking  resettlement \nplanning and implementation; judiciary; the Land Management Department of the \nRoyal University of Agriculture; and domestic consultants, NGOs, and academic \nor  research  institutions  that  could  undertake  resettlement  monitoring,  or  be \notherwise involved in resettlement activities.  \n \n10.  The policy, subdecree, implementing regulations, and technical guidelines will address \nthe following issues: (i) the need to specify procedures and requirements for resettlement \nplanning, as preconditions for project approval; and for reviewing, approving, implementing, \nmonitoring, and evaluating resettlement plans; (ii) confirmation of the overarching principle of at \nleast restoring the incomes and living standards of the people affected, and improving the \nincomes  and  living  standards  of  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups  affected;  (iii) this  will  be \nachieved through compensation to replace lost assets, livelihood and income, assistance for \nrelocation including provision of relocation sites with appropriate facilities and services; and \nassistance for rehabilitation to achieve at least the same level of well-being with a project as \nwithout it, such as skills training and microcredit; (iv) development of procedures for relocation \nsite development, including procedures for mobilizing the necessary finances; (v) provision for \nconsultation with people affected and for grievance redress mechanisms, including gender and \nethnic  balance  on  grievance  committees;  (vi)  development  of  procedures  to  mobilize  the \nnecessary  budgets;  (vii)  incorporating  gender  concerns  into  resettlement  including  gender-\nspecific consultation and information disclosure, and special attention to guarantee women\u2019s \nassets, property, and land-use rights; and (viii) methodologies for calculating compensation for \npermanent and temporary losses equivalent to market value. ", "4    \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $480,000 equivalent, comprising $230,000 of \nforeign exchange costs and $250,000 equivalent of local currency costs. ADB will provide \n$400,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $170,000 equivalent of the \nlocal currency costs. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. \nThe Government will finance the balance of the local currency costs, equivalent to $80,000, in \nkind  through  the  provision  of  counterpart  and  support  staff,  office  accommodation, \nadministrative support, and other related services and facilities. ADB financing will cover the \ncosts of consultants, workshops, seminars, training, equipment, publications, communications, \ntranslation/interpretation, and travel. The World Bank fully supports the TA and will provide \n$25,000 on a parallel grant basis to finance an assessment of the key institutional requirements, \nincluding capacity improvements, required nationally to implement the legal subdecree. Tentative \ndetails of the cost estimates and financing plan are provided in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  Executing Agency. MEF will be the Executing Agency. The IRC chair will be the TA \ndirector. A working group will be formed with MEF as chair and MLMUPC as vice chair, under \nthe technical direction and support of the Council for Land Policy (CLP) and the IRC. Other \nmembers of the working group will include representatives of \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 du Camboges, Ministry \nof Industry and Energy, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Public Works and Transport, Ministry of \nWater Resources and Meteorology, and Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs. \n \n13.  Implementing Agency. MLMUPC will be the Implementing Agency. The Council for \nLand Policy under MLMUPC will provide technical direction and support. MLMUPC will provide \noffice  space  and  administrative  support  for  the  TA,  and  will  assign  at  least  two  technical \nspecialists to work closely with the international and domestic consultants. NGOs experienced \nwith resettlement in Cambodia will be consulted, participate in reviewing the document drafts, \nand be involved in the training needs assessment and training of trainers. \n \n14.  Selection of Consultants and Procurement. The TA will require a total of 28 person-\nmonths of consulting services (10 person-months for international and 18 person-months for \ndomestic consultants). Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. ADB will recruit, through \ndirect  selection,  the  nonprofit  organization,  East  West  Management  Institute  (EWMI).  The \ninstitute has been working at MLMUPC since July 2001 on two ADB-funded TAs that are \ncomplementary  to  and  set  the  stage  for  this  TA.3  EWMI  has  established  strong  working \nrelationships with the key stakeholders at MLMUPC, CLP, relevant Government officials, NGOs, \neducational and legal institutions, all of which can be immediately tapped for the TA. Their \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Implementation of Land Legislation. Manila, and \nADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Implementation of Land Legislation\u2013Phase 2. \nManila.  Specifically,  EWMI  has  assisted  MLMUPC  and  CLP  to  (i)  develop  and  implement  participatory \npolicymaking and legislative drafting processes; (ii) develop a broad range of public awareness materials for the \nstakeholders for this TA; (iii) develop training materials and a definitive textbook on Cambodian land law for land \nand law professionals to be revised by EWMI to include new material about resettlement; and (iv) develop \nprocedures for investigation and conciliation of land disputes, develop training materials, and conduct training on \ninvestigating and conciliation of land disputes. EWMI has an established TA office and staff in MLMUPC, which can \nbe applied to the TA as part of the Government\u2019s in-kind contribution, and would require minimal TA start-up time. \nAs a nonprofit organization, EWMI\u2019s overhead is low, leaving more of the limited TA funds for essential capacity \nbuilding. \n \n ", "      5\nstrong relationship with MLMUPC and CLP is particularly important given that resettlement will \nbe very new for them, and having experienced consultants whom they know and trust will make \nfor  a  smoother  process.  The  TA  will  finance  international  and  domestic  consultants  with \nexpertise  in  Cambodian  land-related  legal  procedures,  resettlement  policy  development, \nindigenous  peoples,  asset  valuation,  land  management  assessment,  poverty  assessment, \napplied social research, participatory approaches, gender analysis, training needs assessment, \nand training of trainers. The consultants will be engaged by ADB according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants.  Office  equipment  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. \n \n15.  Implementation Schedule, TA Review, and Reporting. The TA is proposed to be \nimplemented over 24 months, from February 2005 to February 2007. The output from phase 1 \nwill  be  the  complete  drafts  of  (i)  the  national  resettlement  policy,  (ii)  the  subdecree  on \nresettlement, (iii) implementing regulations, and (iv) technical guidelines. The outputs of phase 2 \nwill be (i) issuance by the Prime Minister of the approved policy and subdecree, (ii) issuance of \nimplementing regulations and technical guidelines, and (iii) an established resettlement division \nwithin the designated regulatory body with staff ready to be trained under phase 3, and a \ntraining needs assessment. The outputs of phases 1 and 2 will be of good international standard \nacceptable to ADB, and will be produced in both English and Khmer languages. The outputs \nfrom phase 3 will be (i) the final training program, together with training materials and evaluation \nreports from the trial application of the training program; (ii) resettlement trainers trained through \na  training-of-trainers  approach;  and  (iii)  delivery  of  initial  resettlement  training  to  key \nGovernment agencies and entities. By the time phase 3 is reached, hopefully a commitment will \nhave been obtained for alternative financing for additional capacity development.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Cambodia  for  Enhancing  the  Resettlement  Legal  Framework  and \nInstitutional Capacity, and hereby reports this action to the Board.
