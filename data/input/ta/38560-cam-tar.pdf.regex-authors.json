INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of Cambodia has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for \ntechnical assistance (TA)1 to support the preparation of the Second Rural Water Supply and \nSanitation  Sector  Project.  The  TA  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  overall  strategy  for  rural \ndevelopment and poverty reduction as well as contribute to the achievement of the Cambodian \nMillennium Development Goals (CMDGs).  \n \n2.  ADB\u2019s overarching goal for Cambodia is sustainable poverty reduction. The Country \nStrategy and Program Results Framework2  rests on three strategic pillars: (i) sustainable \npro-poor economic growth, (ii) inclusive social development, and (iii) good governance and \nimproved delivery of public services. Better health and a better quality of life for the rural \npopulation is a strategic goal of inclusive social development. The rural water supply and \nsanitation (RWSS) sector is identified as a sector in which ADB will play a catalytic role. The TA \nis included as a firm TA for 2008 in the Cambodia country strategy and program midterm review \nand country operations business plan 2007\u20132009.3 \n \n3.  The TA Fact-Finding Mission was carried out from 24 to 31 January 2008, and resulted \nin a memorandum of understanding (MOU), summarizing the agreements with the Government. \nThe MOU was signed by the Government and ADB on 25 February 2008. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  The  rural  population  of  Cambodia  has  limited  access  to  safe  water  and  hygienic \nsanitation, resulting in poor health, lost productive time due to sickness, missed schooling \nopportunities for children, and increased medical expenditures. Worst affected are women and \ngirls, who bear the primary responsibility for collecting and storing water. In 2004, only 29% of \nthe rural population had access to improved water supply4 and only 8% to improved sanitation,5 \nagainst 34% and 16% of the total population, respectively.6  \n \n5.  The Government\u2019s National Water Supply and Sanitation Policy (2003) states that every \nCambodian in the rural areas shall have access to safe water and sanitation by 2025. In line \nwith the CMDGs, the Government is committed to increasing the coverage of improved water \nsupply to 50% of rural populations by 2015, and sanitation coverage to 30%. According to the \nRWSS Sector Investment Plan (2005\u20132015),7 $116 million in capital investment and $4.8 million \nin recurrent costs will be required to reach the CMDGs. About 58% of the investment, or $67 \nmillion, is expected to come from external sources. The remaining balance needs to be financed \nby the Government ($11 million) and the communities ($39 million). The major share of the \ncommunities\u2019 contribution ($30 million) is for construction materials for sanitation works, e.g. \nlatrines and other onsite sanitation facilities. External and Government financing is needed for \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 25 March 2008. \n2  ADB. 2007.

The RWSS sector in Cambodia is supported by various nongovernment organizations \nand development agencies: (i) the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) of the World Bank has \nactive  projects  on  validating  domestic  water  treatment  technologies  and  on  assessing  the \npotential of small-scale private sector involvement in rural water supply; (ii) Japan International \nCooperation Agency (JICA) is preparing the third phase of its rural water supply project in \nKampong Cham province; (iii) the European Commission\u2019s Humanitarian Aid (ECHO) program \nprovides funds to various NGOs to implement health programs and to provide access to safe \nwater and sanitation for whole villages in the most remote rural areas; and (iv) the United \nNations Development  Programme (UNDP) provides assistance in the fields of governance \nreforms, political processes, and private sector development. \n7.   ADB is currently the only donor providing substantial investment funds ($18 million) \nthrough the Tonle Sap Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project.8 It is a sector project \ndesigned to increase water supply coverage in 6 years from 20% to 50% and improve sanitation \ncoverage from 10% to 30% for the rural population of five provinces around the Tonle Sap, \nthrough  (i) investment  in  water  supply  infrastructure,  (ii)  community  mobilization  and  skills \ndevelopment, (iii) subsidies for latrine construction, and (iv) capacity building and institutional \nsupport.  To  make  the  investments  more  sustainable,  the  Tonle  Sap  project  (i)  is  highly \ndecentralized, (ii) follows a community demand\u2013driven approach, (ii) trains and develops the \nskills of the rural population in operation and maintenance, especially women, and (iii) provides \nhygiene education. The community-demand driven approach is embedded in a comprehensive \nand effective village engagement strategy, developed under the project, which includes the \nestablishment of water and sanitation user groups. It is the best performing project in ADB\u2019s \nCambodia portfolio.  \n \n8.  Following  2  years  of  implementation,  lessons  learned  from  the  Tonle  Sap  project \nindicate that suitable groundwater sources are generally located at much greater depths than \npreviously assumed. As a result, the sustainable yields are lower than projected. For more \nsuccessful well drilling, the project needs to (i) set up a proper database management system, \n(ii) inventory all existing coverage and groundwater data, and (iii) require standard geotechnical \nsurveys before well drilling. These measures will help reduce the number of unsuccessful wells \nand lead to the selection and development of appropriate water sources for the project and \nfuture projects. The database must be linked to the coverage database to be developed under \nthe Tonle Sap project, and must be publicly accessible. \n \n9.   The Second Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project will increase and expand \nwater supply and sanitation coverage in the five provinces of the Tonle Sap area to contribute to \n(i) meeting the poverty and environmental challenges of this basin areas and, (ii) achieving \nCMDG  targets,  and  (iii)  using  the  existing  implementation  structure  to  allow  for  efficient \nimplementation. Three additional provinces located adjacent to the Tonle Sap project area will \nalso be included to expand the Project\u2019s outreach: Banteay Meanchey, Oddar Meanchey, and \nPreah Vihear. These three provinces are the poorest provinces in Cambodia with low water \nsupply and sanitation coverage ratios. The water supply coverage in Banteay Meanchey is only \n15%, in Preah Vihear 32%, and in Oddar Meanchy 37%. The sanitation coverage is 15% in \nBanteay Meanchey, 3% in Preah Vihear, and 3% in Oddar Meanchy (footnote 7).  \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2005. Grant Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Tonle Sap Rural Water Supply and Sanitation \nSector Project. Manila (approved in October). \n ", "  3\n \n10.  The Project will follow the sector-based approach and the design of the successful Tonle \nSap project. The project will also adopt a community demand\u2013driven approach to promote \ncommunity involvement and ownership in the (i) choice of water sources and selection of well \nlocations; (ii) design, operation, and maintenance of water supply and sanitation infrastructure; \nand  (iii)  hygiene  education.  It  will  use  the  current  Executing  Agency  (EA)  and  the \nimplementation structure established in the Tonle Sap provinces. For the new provinces, a \nsimilar implementation structure will be set up by the EA, on the basis of the experience on the \nTonle Sap project. \n \n11.  Most previous investments in the RWSS sector have not been sustainable, because of \n(i) lack of community involvement, especially among women, in the selection of appropriate \ntechnologies; (ii) lack of support for skills development programs for the proper operation and \nmaintenance of the facilities; and (iii) limited awareness of hygiene and sanitation practices in \nrural communities. Involving the communities in the design, building, and management of the \nfacilities will increase ownership, and hence sustainability, by allowing the communities to select \nfacilities, technologies, and systems that are more appropriate for their specific socioeconomic \nand cultural circumstances. The Project will identify previously constructed facilities, and, when \nrequired, rehabilitate these, establish water and sanitation user groups, and provide training and \nskills development to the communities. \n \n12.  Water in rural communities comes mainly from communal taps and standpipes, requiring \nsafe, hygienic collection and storage to avoid contamination. The introduction of more advanced \nwater supply facilities may lead the communities to abandon traditional and cultural practices, \ne.g., boiling of water. In fact, water-related diseases can become more prevalent as a result. \nUnder the project, communities will be trained to apply or restore appropriate practices for the \ntransport, storage, and treatment of drinking water for households.  \n \n13.  At current rates of latrine construction and population growth, Cambodia\u2019s sanitation \nsector MDG for 2015 (30% coverage) will not be reached for more than 30 years, and full \ncoverage will not be reached for more than 100 years. The low coverage levels will have serious \nconsequences in terms of health, economic opportunity, and human dignity. The impact on all \nthese dimensions is felt particularly strongly by women, and poor households headed by women \nare among the most severely affected. Awareness of proper hygiene practices will increase \ndemand for improved sanitation. \n \n14.  There is a strong demand for latrines among the Cambodian population, yet this demand \nremains mostly unrealized. The predominant problem is one of cost and consumers usually  \nprefer to wait until they can purchase the more expensive designs. However, simple self-built \nlatrines  using  locally  fabricated  materials  can  cost  as  little  as  $5\u2500$10  and  are  therefore \naffordable  for  even  the  poorest  households.  These  simple  designs  can  deliver  the  top \nconsumer-identified benefits of latrine ownership, improved hygiene and cleanliness, comfort, \nhealth, safety, convenience, and privacy.  \n \n15.  The Project will develop a program to raise hygiene awareness and demonstrate that the \nhigh-end design preference can be overcome and consumers will construct cheaper latrines if \nadequately  motivated  to  do  so.  The  project  will  strengthen  the  supply  side  to  provide \ntechnologies at the cheap and mid-range end of the market. The components of cheaper \ndesigns are available, but cheaper design options are not \u2018packaged\u2019 in a way that is obvious or \naccessible to consumers. The Project will develop product and service offerings that are more \ntailored to consumer needs, making latrine purchases more attractive and affordable. \n ", "4   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n16.  The TA will help improve water supply and sanitation facilities for the rural population in \neight provinces, and institute safer hygiene practices in those areas. About 500,000 rural people \nwill have access to these facilities by end of project implementation. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1 and the initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n17.  The outcome will be an agreed grant sector project designed to (i) increase the number \nof water supply and sanitation facilities; (ii) strengthen the capacity of communities to design, \nbuild, and manage water supply and sanitation facilities; and (iii) provide hygiene and sanitation \neducation in eight provinces in and around the Tonle Sap basin area. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n18.  To expand coverage and outreach and contribute to meeting the CMDG targets, the \nproject  will  be  implemented  in  the  five  provinces  of  the  Tonle  Sap  project  (Battambang,  \nKompong Chhnang, Kompong Thom, Pursat, and Siem Reap) and three additional provinces \nadjacent to the Tonle Sap area (Banteay Meanchey, Oddar Meanchey, and Preah Vihear).  \n \n19.  The villages to be included in the project will be the poorest villages in these provinces. \nThe communities to be included will be identified during project implementation on the basis of \npredefined criteria, including poverty level and coverage ratio. \n \n20.  The TA will have the following outputs:  \n(i)  an update of the Government\u2019s RWSS investment plan for the eight provinces; \n(ii)  an approved outline of the RWSS database, including identified data sources; \n(iii)  an approved community demand\u2013driven approach; \n(iv)  an  approved  hygiene  education  plan,  including  appropriate  sanitation  and \nhousehold water supply transport, storage, and treatment practices; \n(v)  an approved proposal for the financing of the sanitation materials; and \n(vi)  an overall sector investment project covering eight provinces, including feasibility \nstudies of a sample of three subprojects. \n \n21.  The design of the ensuing project will follow that of the ongoing Tonle Sap project. The \nlessons  learned  so  far  will  be  incorporated,  specifically  (i)  the  requirement  to  carry  out \ngeotechnical surveys before drilling, and (ii) the lack of a publicly available RWSS database. \nThe TA consultants will recommend a suitable way of compiling the information collected under \nthe ongoing Tonle Sap project, the ensuing project, and other projects into a national and \npublicly accessible database. \n \n22.  Although  rural  sanitation  facilities  are  most  commonly  provided  under  subsidized \nschemes,  community  financing  is  recommended  under  other  approaches  such  as \ncommunity-led total sanitation schemes. The TA consultants will review the success of the \nvarious modes of financing and supplying affordable sanitation materials. They will also assess \nthe availability, quality and relevance of educational materials on hygiene and sanitation readily \navailable with the Government or development partners. A proposal for the development of \nadditional materials and for appropriate modes of financing for the sanitation infrastructure will \nbe prepared. \n ", "  5\n \n23.  Project  outputs  and  relevant  information  will  be  disseminated  through  stakeholder \nconsultations and TA workshops. During the TA, ADB will conduct policy dialogue with the \nGovernment on an overall strategy for RWSS, and with development partners on the need to \navoid overlapping and duplication in RWSS investments.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n24.  The TA is expected to cost $600,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $500,000, to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The \nGovernment will finance the remaining $100,000 in kind, by shouldering the cost of office \naccommodation, transport, and utilities; and remuneration of counterpart staff. The Government \nhas been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \nThe cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n25.  The Department of Rural Water Supply of the Ministry of Rural Development will be the \nExecuting Agency for the TA. The project management unit established under the Tonle Sap \nproject  will  implement  the  TA.  It  will  be  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  coordination  and \nmonitoring  of  TA  activities,  and  will  provide  guidance  to  consultants,  facilitate  stakeholder \nworkshops, and supervise surveys. The TA will be implemented according to the standard \noperating procedures for externally financed projects in Cambodia.9  \n \n26.  A team of international and national consultants will be recruited to provide specialized \nservices  totaling  41  person-months  (16  international  persons-months  and  25  national \nperson-months). The consultants will be hired by ADB according to its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time), using quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod with a quality-to-cost ratio of 80:20, and simplified technical proposals. The consultants \nwill have expertise in (i) rural water supply engineering; (ii) rural water supply and sanitation \npolicy  and  institutional  reforms;  (iii)  rural  sanitation;  (iv)  sanitation  and  hygiene  awareness \nraising; (v) community demand\u2013driven approaches; (vi) project economic and financial analyses; \n(vii)  poverty  and  social  analysis,  including  gender  and  ethnic  group  assessment; \n(viii) resettlement; and (ix) environment. The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 4. \n \n27.  Minor equipment, such as computers, printer and copiers will be purchased by ADB \naccording to its Procurement Guidelines (2006, as amended from time to time). The equipment \nwill be handed over to the EA at the end of the TA. \n \n28.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 7 months, from around August 2008 to \naround  February  2009.  Within  1  month  of  TA  start-up,  the  TA  consultants  will  submit  an \ninception report, which will propose the methodology for all the TA activities. An interim report \nwill be submitted within the first 4 months of TA implementation, and a draft final report within \nthe  first  6 months.  Tripartite  meetings  will  be  held  among  the  Government,  ADB,  and  the \nconsulting team at the start of the TA, midway through its implementation, and at its completion. \nKey findings and outputs of the TA will be disseminated through workshops and stakeholder \ndiscussions. \n \n                                                 \n9  Kingdom of Cambodia. 2005.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nRural  water  supply  and  sanitation  (RWSS)  has  been  an  integral  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  overall  strategy  for  rural \ndevelopment and poverty reduction. The rectangular strategy,a the National Poverty Reduction Strategy,b and the Cambodian \nMillennium Development Goals (CMDGs)c place high priority on RWSS. Limited access to safe water and hygienic sanitation, \nresults in poor health, lost productive time due to sickness or the need to care for sick family members, missed schooling \nopportunities for children, and increased medical expenditures. Women (especially female heads of households) and children, \nwho bear the primary responsibility for collecting water, are the worst affected.  \nADB\u2019s overarching goal for Cambodia, as defined in its CSP (2005\u20132009), is sustainable poverty reduction. To achieve this, \nthe  CSP  Results  Framework  (2006\u20132010)  rests  on  three  strategic  pillars:  (i)  sustainable  pro-poor  economic  growth, \n(ii) inclusive social development, and (iii) good governance and improved public service delivery. The CSPRF identifies the \nimproved health and quality of life for the rural population as a strategic goal of inclusive social development. The key \nconstraints on achieving this goal are (i) lack of investment and maintenance of drinking water and sanitation facilities; and \n(ii) insufficient community awareness of the links between safe water, sanitation, and health, resulting in poor hygiene \npractices. The RWSS sector is identified as a sector in which ADB will play a catalytic role.  \n \nB.    Targeting Classification          \n1.

Explain the basis for the targeting classification: The project contributes directly to the attainment of the Cambodia MDGs \non RWSS: 50% of the rural population with access to safe water, and 30% with access to improved sanitation, by 2015. \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1. If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \n2. What resources are allocated in the PPTA/due diligence? \nA poverty analysis will be prepared during the PPTA, resulting in a poverty and social strategy plan. Consultants will \ncomprise an international social development specialist (4 person-months), a national social development specialist \n(4 person-months), and a social survey and data collection specialist (2 person-months).  \n3. If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)? \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA. Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from the \nproject? \nPotential beneficiaries are the poor rural population in the eight poorest provinces in Cambodia: Siem Reap, Battambang, \nPursat, Kompong Chhnang, Kompong Thom, Preah Vihear, Oddar Meanchey, and Banteay Meanchey. Improved water \nsupply and sanitation facilities will become more accessible to the poor and socially excluded, thus reducing the incidence of \nwater-related diseases and improving health. \n \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \nThe beneficiaries will need to have (i) access to appropriate and improved water supply and sanitation facilities; (ii) skills \ndevelopment in the operation and management of the facilities; and (iii) more awareness of the link between health, \nhygiene, and sanitation. \n3.  What are the potential constraints on accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project address \nthem? \n-  The sustainability of the facilities, because of lack of maintenance. The selection of appropriate technologies, based on a \nparticipatory selection, should create ownership and ensure affordability.  \n-  Cultural acceptance of new technologies, especially sanitation. Participatory selection of appropriate technologies and \nimproved awareness should mitigate the cultural constraints. The PPTA will look at the feasibility of restoring traditional, \nindigenous and sustainable water, health, and sanitation practices, and will assess the extent to which traditional and \ncultural practices may potentially be changed when the project introduces more modern water supply and sanitation \nfacilities. \n-  The selection of the population that will benefit. The PPTA will develop guidelines to ensure that the poor rural population \nwill benefit from the ensuing project, in line with the ongoing Tonle Sap Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project \n(the Tonle Sap project).. \nB. Consultation and Participation \n1.  Indicate the potential initial stakeholders.  \nA stakeholder analysis will be undertaken to identify key project stakeholders, their project-related interests, and their role in \ndetermining project feasibility and success. The stakeholder analysis will cover government officials from the ongoing Tonle \nSap project, other government agencies, international and bilateral agencies, nongovernment organizations, provincial and \ndistrict authorities, civil society, and project-affected people and communities.  \n2.   What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., workshops, \ncommunity mobilization, involvement of nongovernment organizations and community-based organizations)? \nOn the basis of the stakeholder analysis, a wide range of stakeholders and beneficiaries will be consulted during project \npreparation.  At  inception,  midterm,  and  final  review,  workshops  will  be  organized  to  disseminate  results  and  invite \nstakeholders to participate in joint analysis and action planning. \n3. What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n     Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n4. Will a C&P plan be prepared?    Yes          No    Please explain.  \nC. Gender and Development \n1.  What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project/program? \nCambodian women are responsible for a variety of tasks related to water, sanitation, and hygiene in their families. Limited \naccess to safe water and hygienic sanitation results in poor health, lost productive time due to sickness, missed schooling \nopportunities for children, and increased medical expenditures. Women and girls bear the primary responsibility for collecting \nand storing water and are the worst affected. \n2. Does the proposed project/program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment by \nimproving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and participation in decision \nmaking?      Yes          No    Please explain.  \nIncluding women in decision making and providing skills training in the operation and management of the facilities will offer \npotential for gender mainstreaming. A gender analysis will be undertaken during PPTA, and a gender action plan will be \nprepared for the ensuing project.  \n3. Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or to widen gender inequality? \n          Yes          No     \n ", "  Appendix 2  11 \n \nIII.
