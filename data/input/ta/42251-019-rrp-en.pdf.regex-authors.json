THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed results-\nbased loans to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the additional financing of the \nSkills Sector Enhancement Program. The report also describes the proposed administration of a \ngrant to be provided by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) for the additional financing \nof the Skills Sector Enhancement Program, and if the Board approves the proposed loans, I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the grant. \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the program for $100 million equivalent on \n28 March 2014 to support the first phase (2014\u20132016) of the government\u2019s 7-year Skills Sector \nDevelopment  Program  (SSDP),  2014\u20132020.1  The  SSDP  aims  to  build  an  efficient  skills \ndevelopment system to meet labor market demand. The proposed additional financing will enable \nthe government to implement the SSDP through 2020 and add value by scaling up successful \nprogram interventions and accelerating the pace of reform initiatives.2  \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Strategic Context \n \n3.  Sri Lanka\u2019s economy grew by 6.7% per year from 2003 to 2012 but has slowed down to \n4.4% since 2013. The government envisions to transform its economy into a knowledge-based \none and achieve upper middle-income status by 2025.3 For this, the government plans to increase \ninvestment in human capital to support economic diversification and enhance productivity.4 \n \n4.  Sri Lanka has achieved universal primary enrollment, high secondary enrollment, gender \nparity in access to all levels of education, and a high adult literacy rate. But it faces significant \nmismatches between youth competencies and labor market demand as well as between youth \naspirations and the jobs available in the market. The private sector sees the lack of skilled labor \nas a key constraint to business growth. One out of five men or women aged 15\u201324 years is \nunemployed, and the youth unemployment rate is more than four times higher than the overall \nunemployment rate. At 35.9%, Sri Lanka also has a low female labor force participation rate. \nFemale students are outperforming male students in academic achievement at every level up to \ntertiary, but their labor market outcome is poor. The female youth unemployment rate is twice as \nhigh as that of male youths.5 Equipping youths, especially young women, with employable skills \nis an important strategy to decrease youth unemployment and prepare the workforce for a high \nvalue-adding economy. \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014.

Sri Lanka has a good foundation for technical and vocational education and training \n(TVET), including a dedicated ministry, an apex regulatory body, a training institution for TVET \ninstructors, and several agencies to deliver TVET at different levels using diverse training delivery \nmethods. But the TVET system faces many challenges,6 particularly the need to increase market \nrelevance through private sector participation in a system dominated by public institutions. \nAttracting more young women into the labor force and equipping them with employable skills to \nincrease their labor market participation is another challenge. \n \n6.  The government approved the SSDP in 2013. It is the first comprehensive, medium-term, \nand sector-wide development program aiming to (i) transform TVET into a market-responsive, \nequitable, and quality system; and (ii) improve recognition of TVET through better policies, \nsystems, and structures. It will expand training capacity by almost 100,000 seats, while increasing \nprivate sector participation and improving quality. ADB supported the government in preparing \nthe SSDP and a medium-term expenditure framework, building on its past assistance to TVET \ndevelopment.  Strengthening  the  TVET  system  fully  aligns  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership \nstrategy, 2018\u20132022 for Sri Lanka and contributes to pillar 1 (promoting economic diversification \nand productivity enhancement) by upgrading human capital.7 \n \nB.  Program Rationale \n \n7.  The current Skills Sector Enhancement Program supported SSDP implementation from \n2014 to 2016. When the program was approved by the Board in 2014, additional financing of \n$100 million was envisaged to continue supporting SSDP implementation up to 2020, subject to \ngood performance. The program has been performing well. The program made good progress \ntoward outcome and output targets. The employment rate of TVET graduates increased from 50% \nin 2012 to 57% in 2015, exceeding the target of 55%. The program exceeded or fully achieved 12 \nof the 17 output indicators in the design and monitoring framework, and is on track to achieve the \nremaining indicators. Capacity development activities and risk mitigation measures have been \neffective in keeping program performance on track.8 As of December 2017, ADB disbursed 90.5% \nor $87.0 million out of $96.1 million against 30 out of 33 disbursement-linked indicator (DLI) \ntargets; the remaining targets are on track for achievement.  \n \n8.  Beyond  the  results  achievement,  the  program  has  clear  value  addition,  by  helping \nstakeholders stay focused on results rather than transactions and inputs. Focusing on results \nencouraged a spirit of enquiry, a willingness to learn, an openness to try new approaches and, \nultimately, a greater sense of ownership of the progress achieved.9 This was evident in the \nemployment-linked training program for private training providers, the performance allowance \nscheme for instructors, and the performance-based financing mechanism for selected training \ncenters.  \n \n9.  Continued improvement of the TVET system remains the government\u2019s top priority, as \nreflected in the Public Investment Programme, 2017\u20132020 and Vision 2025. The midterm review \nof the SSDP confirmed that its scope and key interventions remain technically sound, and ADB\u2019s \n                                                \n6  The challenges include the lack of qualified TVET instructors and training managers, outdated training programs and \nfacilities, lack of coordination among many public agencies, a rigid and largely ineffective regulatory framework, \nlimited investment to upgrade facilities and human resources, and social stigma associated with TVET and technical \njobs. \n7  ADB. 2017.

Manila.   \n ", "3 \nresults-based lending (RBL) modality has been effective in supporting the implementation. In the \nbeginning of 2017, the government provided the Skills Sector Development Division (SSDD) \nunder the executing agency, the Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational Training (MSDVT), \nwith more experienced professionals competitively sourced from the market to strengthen the \nSSDD\u2019s capacity and accelerate implementation progress. \n \n10.  The program used DLIs to focus the stakeholders\u2019 efforts on critical reform areas, while \nstrengthening program systems in fiduciary management, safeguards, monitoring and evaluation \n(M&E), and gender and social inclusion. It helped reorient the TVET system to focus on the \nemployment outcome. The additional financing will scale up key interventions and achieve a \nhigher level of outcome and output targets. It will also incorporate new results areas as DLIs to \nexert more influence over the SSDP. These will help deepen the ongoing reforms and ensure \ntheir sustainability beyond the program period. The additional financing will be accompanied by a \ngrant project for women\u2019s empowerment and private sector engagement, where the government \nhas started important reforms under the current program but needs to build up experience in \nsuccessful innovations to gain momentum for larger-scale interventions. \n \n11.  Additional financing is most suitable for this support because the ongoing government \nprogram and well-established implementation arrangements promise large efficiency gains. The \nRBL modality will continue because it effectively promotes critical changes to the TVET system \nin an adequately phased but flexible manner by focusing on results rather than inputs and \ntransactions. Stakeholders have gained significant experience in the modality. The additional \nfinancing builds on current program achievements but with necessary updates reflecting lessons \nso far. It will enable ADB to effectively support SSDP objectives, improve program systems, and \nincrease their sustainability beyond the program period. The additional financing is included in \nADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2018\u20132020 for Sri Lanka.10 \n \nC.  Program Scope \n \n12.  The scope of the current program covers the first phase (2014\u20132016) of the SSDP. The \noverall program, including additional financing (Table 1), will have the same program scope as \nthe SSDP, except for high-value procurement contracts as per the RBL policy. \n \nTable 1: Program Scope \nSkills Sector Development Program and Skills Sector Enhancement Program \nItem  (including additional financing) \nOutcome  Efficient skills education system to meet local and foreign labor market demand \nKey outputs  Improved quality, relevance, access, and recognition for vocational training; and supportive \npolicies, systems, and structures \nExpenditure size  $874 milliona \nMain financiers  Government of Sri Lanka ($547.4 million), Asian Development Bank ($196.1 million), World \nBank ($101.5 million), Export-Import Bank of Korea ($26 million), Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction ($3 million) \nImplementation period  2014\u20132020b \na  Excludes $87 million under ministries other than the Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational Training. \nb  The program completion date of 30 June 2021 and loan closing date of 31 December 2021 will allow verification of \nresults achievement and disbursement. \nSources: Asian Development Bank; and Government of Sri Lanka, Department of National Planning. \n \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2017.

The impact, outcome, and outputs of the current program will be retained for the overall \nprogram, but with scaled-up and additional targets. The overall program impact will be increased \nemployability of the Sri Lankan workforce, particularly youths. The outcome will be a market-\nresponsive and inclusive TVET system. Outcome achievement will be measured by the increase \nin TVET graduates\u2019 employment rate and successful business creation (DLI 1). The primary \nbeneficiaries will be Sri Lankan youths who seek gainful employment. DLI targets are carefully \nselected to ensure (i) greater value addition from ADB financing in transforming the TVET system \nby setting increasingly higher targets in key results, and (ii) synergy with other ADB interventions \nin Sri Lanka.11 The overall program outputs are described in paras. 14\u201317, and the DLIs are \nsummarized in Table 2.12 \n \n14.  Output 1: Quality of TVET provision improved. This output will strengthen the capacity \nof the Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission as the regulatory body. It will reorient the \nquality assurance system to focus on training outcome (i.e., student and employer satisfaction \nfrom quality training delivery) and not on training inputs and processes (DLI 2, program action \nplan [PAP] 1.2). MSDVT will introduce a recognition and award program for quality training \ncenters and individual quality champions to promote a system-wide quality culture (DLI 2). It will \nimprove the (i) articulation of competencies within the national vocational qualification (NVQ) \nframework for multiple, flexible pathways (PAP 1.3); and (ii) efficiency of the assessment process \n(PAP 1.4). The program will continuously monitor the availability of an adequate number of \ninstructors  and  the  performance  allowance  scheme  that  was  introduced  under  the  current \nprogram to ensure the quality of TVET provision (DLI 3). \n \n15.  Output 2: Industry partnership for TVET planning and provision enhanced. This \noutput  will  increase  private  sector  participation  in  TVET  planning  and  provision  for  better \nalignment  with  market  demand.  Industry  sector  skills  councils  (ISSCs)  will  carry  out  skills \nforecasting for at least six priority sectors.13 MSDVT will start at least 15 training programs aligned \nwith industry demand (DLI 4, PAP 1.6 and 1.8). At least 8,000 trainees will be trained by the \nprivate sector, especially in private companies, using an employment-linked training agreement \n(DLI 5). MSDVT will establish at least nine university colleges to deliver mid-level skills training \ndemanded by the industry (PAP 1.5). This output will also support (i) provision of industry \nexposure training to more instructors (DLI 3); (ii) completion of on-the-job training by more \ngraduates; and (iii) provision of skills-upgrading opportunities to in-service workers (DLI 6). \n \n16.  Output  3:  TVET  participation  and  equitable  access  increased.  This  output  will \nincrease TVET program enrollments to 224,000 students (DLI 6); help 35,000 workers obtain \nNVQ certificates through recognition of prior learning (PAP 1.4); and provide 60,000 school \nleavers, women, and people from disadvantaged groups with stipends for training in emerging \nand critical skills gap areas (PAP 1.7). To encourage women to participate in TVET and find jobs, \n                                                \n11 Responding to the government\u2019s emphasis on employment creation, the overall program introduced a new target on \nthe self-employment promotion loan scheme, and improved entrepreneurship development programs as well as \ndedicated support for women\u2019s participation in TVET and employment support. Some indicators aim to achieve \ngreater synergy with other ADB interventions, such as (i) creating pathways from school education to TVET, \nsupporting the government\u2019s 13-year mandatory education (DLI 6 on enrollment, in synergy with ADB\u2019s Education \nSector Development Program); and (ii) new or expansion of existing training programs as informed by the Colombo-\nTrincomalee Economic Corridor study (DLI 4 on skills gap analysis). \n12 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n13 These include (i) construction; (ii) tourism and hospitality; (iii) information technology; (iv) light engineering and \nmanufacturing; and (v) other strategic areas for the government\u2019s economic diversification efforts, and various service \nsectors with many employment opportunities such as logistics, transportation, and health and care. \n ", "5 \nthis output will support (i) new training programs in emerging service sectors that will hire many \nwomen; (ii) scholarship, coaching, and career guidance for women in nontraditional areas; and \n(iii) pilot interventions with employers to overcome barriers in employing women (PAP 6). \n \n17.  Output 4: Sector management to implement policy, institutional, and operational \nreforms improved. This output will strengthen sector management and coordination capacity by \nestablishing a high-level interministerial committee and the SSDD in MSDVT (DLI 9, PAP 1.1 and \n1.10). MSDVT will assess capacity utilization among existing facilities and reinvigorate district \ncoordination committees to lead local resource sharing and joint activities across TVET agencies \n(PAP 1.8). It will pilot and expand performance-based financing in public training centers (DLI 7). \nThis output will improve M&E (DLI 8, PAP 5); planning and budgeting (DLI 9, PAP 1.9); fiduciary \ncapacity (DLI 8, PAP 2 and 3); and safeguards (PAP 4). A sector-wide gender equity and social \ninclusion framework (GESIF) will guide overall SSDP implementation (PAP 6, DLI 1 and 6). \n \nTable 2: Disbursement-Linked Indicators \nDisbursement Allocated  Share of Total ADB Financing \nDisbursement-Linked Indicators  ($ million)  (%) \nOutcome \n13  13 \n1.

Expenditure Framework and Financing Plan \n \n19.  Program  expenditures.  The  7-year  SSDP  expenditure  framework  was  updated  to \n$874 million to reflect actual expenditure in 2014\u20132016 and other adjustments (Table 3).14 The \nupdated  framework  is  financially  feasible  even  under  conservative  assumptions.  Actual \nexpenditures in 2014\u20132016 account for 29% of the overall expenditure framework, with recurrent \nexpenditures and capital spending in equipment and civil works broadly on track. Spending on \nknowledge enhancement (i.e., training and staff capacity development) is lower than what was \nbudgeted in the expenditure framework, but it grew more than 15% annually from 2013 to 2016, \nshowing improvement in MSDVT\u2019s execution capacity. Total SSDP expenditure during 2017\u2013\n2020 is expected to increase significantly, subject to supportive budget allocation and further \ncapacity enhancement. \n \n                                                \n14 Program Expenditure and Financing Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nTable 3: Summary of Program Expenditure Framework \n(in 2017 prices) \n  Current Program (2014\u20132016)    Overall Program (2014\u20132020) \nAmount  Amount  Amount  Amount \nItem  (SLRs million)  ($ million)    (SLRs million)  ($ million) \nRecurrent budget  18,709  144    47,505  365 \nCapital budget           \n  Equipment  3,627  28    14,886  115 \n  Civil works  8,118  62    26,822  206 \n  Knowledge enhancement  2,975  23    24,435  188 \nTotal  33,429  257    113,648  874 \nNote: An exchange rate of $1 = SLRs130 was used for 2014\u20132020.

Program  financing.  The  government  will  provide  $547.4  million  (62.6%)  and \ndevelopment partners are expected to contribute $326.6 million (37.4%) to the overall program. \nThe government has requested (i) a regular loan of $40 million, and (ii) a concessional loan of \n$60 million, both from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, to help finance the program. The regular \nloan will have a 20-year term, including a grace period of 5 years; an annual interest rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year  (the  interest  and  other  charges  during \nconstruction to be capitalized in the loan); and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \ndraft regular loan agreement.

SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n \nA.  Program Technical Assessments \n \n25.  The program made good progress toward outcome and output targets. The employment \nrate of TVET graduates (outcome) increased from 50% in 2011 to 57% in 2016, exceeding the \ntarget of 55% as per an independent tracer study. The program achieved, or is on track to fully \nachieve, most output targets (paras. 26\u201329). \n \n26.  Output 1. TVET centers with a quality management system increased from less than 1% \nin 2013 to 15% in October 2017. As of the end of 2016, 68% of overall TVET enrollees (both men \nand women) completed training. NVQ-accredited training programs increased from 13% in 2012 \nto  66%  in  2016.  MSDVT  developed  and  implemented  a  comprehensive  human  resource \ndevelopment plan. The instructor vacancy ratio decreased from 44% in 2014 to 32% in May 2017, \nwhile cadre positions increased from 3,418 in 2014 to 4,213 in 2017. With ongoing recruitment \nefforts, the target of 30% is expected to be met by early 2018. \n \n27.  Output 2. MSDVT established four ISSCs in 2016 and is finalizing two sector training \nplans. It introduced a mechanism to outsource training and employment services to the private \nsector, which will provide employment-oriented training opportunities to 4,000 students by March \n2018. In 2015, MSDVT established three university colleges through public\u2013private partnerships, \ndelivering diploma-level training programs for construction, health sciences, and information \ntechnology. \n \n28.  Output 3. The TVET system\u2019s capacity increased from 148,131 seats in 2012 to 188,764 \nseats in 2016 (target: 187,000), of which 41.1% were for women.21 As of December 2016, 25,878 \npeople (21.8% women) were certified through recognition of prior learning, against a target of \n12,500. During 2014\u20132016, more than 42,000 students received stipends to encourage TVET \nenrollment and completion (target: 18,000 students). \n \n29.  Output  4.  The  government  introduced  a  sector  program  in  2014  and  established \ncoordination and monitoring mechanisms. MSDVT piloted a performance-based financing model \nin 41 training centers, against a target of 20. MSDVT and the implementing agencies signed \nperformance partnership agreements for better results accountability and alignment between the \nannual agency work plan and budget and the SSDP focus. MSDVT also adopted a GESIF and \nallocated budget and staff for its implementation from 2017. \n \n30.  The program achieved 90.5% disbursement against 30 out of 33 DLI targets as of \nDecember 2017. Three outstanding targets are on track for full achievement by March 2018. ADB \nextended the current loans\u2019 closing date from 30 June 2017 to 31 March 2018 to allow MSDVT to \nachieve the remaining targets. \n \n31.  The additional financing will help MSDVT achieve new DLI targets for 2017\u20132020. It will \nscale up outcome and output performance targets, and add new indicators to seek higher value \naddition from SSDP implementation. It proposes 51 new DLI targets to (i) encourage continuous \nTVET system expansion and improvement in quality and relevance, (ii) deepen ongoing reforms \nand encourage new reforms, and (iii) help institutionalize key interventions for sustainability. \n \n                                                \n21 Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission. 2017. Labour Market Information Bulletin, Vol. 02/2016. Colombo. \n ", "9 \n32.  The additional financing is categorized gender equity as theme because it will raise \nwomen\u2019s participation in TVET and more productive employment through self-employment and \nformal sector jobs. Of the 51 new DLI targets, 10 are for women: four under DLI 1 employment; \ntwo under DLI 5 employment-linked training program, and four under DLI 6 enrollment. MSDVT \nwill continue implementing the comprehensive GESIF developed under the current program, and \nADB will monitor the progress under the PAP. The accompanying JFPR grant project will enhance \nfemale entrepreneurship development, introduce training programs to increase job opportunities \nfor young women and their participation in nontraditional occupational areas (such as auto \nmechanics or electricians), and pilot innovative approaches with the private sector to increase \nfemale employment and retention. \n \nB.  Program Systems Assessments \n \n33.  ADB reviewed the assessments for the current program and updated them, highlighting \n(i) the effect of system strengthening through PAP implementation, and (ii) any areas for further \nimprovement during the additional financing implementation. ADB and MSDVT updated the PAP \nfor continued risk mitigation during the remaining implementation period. \n \n34.  Monitoring and evaluation system. The M&E system improved under the current \nprogram. The SSDD is responsible for M&E coordination, supporting regular monitoring meetings \nand reporting. It is leading the development of a real-time, online MIS, which automates student \nand resource administration at training centers and provides real-time data that can support \ndecision-making. Under the additional financing, the updated PAP will focus on the remaining MIS \ndevelopment  and  deployment,  data  integrity,  adoption  of  a  decision  support  module  (i.e., \ndashboard), and analytical capacity strengthening. The program includes three DLI targets to \nstrengthen the MIS, especially for graduates\u2019 employment tracking (DLI 9).22 \n \n35.  Fiduciary systems. The program followed country public financial management systems, \nwith measures to strengthen the program system included in the PAP and DLIs. The measures \nto mitigate identified risks proved satisfactory, reducing the overall fiduciary risk rating from \nsubstantial to moderate. The mitigation measures will continue under the additional financing. DLI \n8 will motivate MSDVT and the implementing agencies to institutionalize good procurement \npractices. ADB conducted a financial management and procurement capacity assessment for an \nadditional implementing agency, the Sri Lanka Institute of Printing. The Guidelines to Prevent or \nMitigate  Fraud,  Corruption,  and  Other  Prohibited  Activities  in  Results-Based  Lending  for \nPrograms were explained to and discussed with MSDVT.23 \n \n36.  Safeguard  systems.  The  program\u2019s  safeguard  classification\u2014category  B  for  the \nenvironment, category C for involuntary resettlement, and category C for indigenous peoples\u2014\nwill be retained for the additional financing. The program\u2019s safeguard performance has been \nsatisfactory. MSDVT (i) adopted an environmental and social management framework (ESMF) \nfor the SSDP; (ii) established a safeguard cell with an environmental safeguard officer and \nengineers at MSDVT, and focal officers at the implementing agencies; (iii) conducted periodic, \nneeds-based  safeguard  training  for  staff,  supervision  consultants,  and  contractors  on  the \nrequirements of the ESMF; and (iv) used a screening checklist for all civil works, and conducted \nperiodic monitoring and random site visits. No outstanding safeguard issues or grievances need \nto be dealt with. MSDVT will continue with safeguard actions in the PAP. MSDVT updated the \nESMF to reflect implementation experience. \n                                                \n22 Program Monitoring and Evaluation System Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 ADB. 2013.
