At  that  time,  overdependence  on  bank  financing  forced  \nborrowers to take on excessive short-term foreign exchange exposure to finance long-term \nprojects that could generate only local currency revenue, resulting in mismatches with respect to \nboth loan maturity and exchange rates.1 When international confidence in one local currency \ncaused a rapid depreciation against the United States (US) dollar, a payment crisis ensued, \nexacerbating a loss in confidence across the region (the \u201ccontagion\u201d effect). This led to banking \nand  currency  crises  in  several  countries.  Structural  reforms  have  since  been  implemented  \nthroughout the region, and most crisis-affected economies have recovered and returned to  \nrobust  growth.  However,  the  absence  of  alternative  sources2  of  long-term  local  currency \nfinancing and the region\u2019s lack of  efficient bond markets continue to be a source  of potential \nfinancial vulnerability. \n \n2.  The  finance  ministers  of  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)+33  \nestablished the Asian Bond Markets Initiative (ABMI) in August 2003 to boost development of  \nlocal currency bond markets in order to help mitigate the double mismatch problem and recycle \nAsia\u2019s considerable savings within the region. Currently, the ABMI focal group and four working \n \ngroups4 focus on (i) expanding the number and diversifying the makeup of issuers in local \ncurrency bond markets, and (ii) developing an environment conducive and attractive to bond  \nmarket participants. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has supported the ABMI since its  \ninception, particularly through the provision of technical assistance (TA). The ABMI complements  \n \nwork done by other regional forums on bond market development, including the Executives\u2019 \nMeeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP) and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  \n(APEC). 5  \n \n3.  In May 2007, the ABMI working group on creating new securitized debt instruments \n(working group 1, chaired by the Ministry of Finance, Thailand) asked ADB to undertake a study \non how securitization markets in the ASEAN+3 region could be further developed and to explore  \nthe various structures and underlying assets that could be securitized in local currencies. ADB \nManagement  approved  the  concept  paper  on  17  July  2007.6  The  design  and  monitoring  \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  A decade after the 1997\u20131998 financial crisis, Asia has experienced a new financial \ncontagion, this time from the US\u2014the crisis in the subprime mortgage market, which has raised  \n                                                 \n1  Loan maturities became too divergent, to the detriment of both local creditors and borrowers, and the currencies in  \nwhich the loans were made became vulnerable to exchange rate volatility or, worse, local currency  exchange rate \ndepreciation. \n2  Bank loans have, in most cases, 5\u201310 years tenor. \n3  ASEAN+3  comprises  the  10  members  of  ASEAN  (Brunei  Darussalam,  Cambodia,  Indonesia,  Lao  People\u2019s  \nDemocratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam) and People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC), Japan, and Republic of Korea. \n4  The four working groups are  working group 1\u2014New securitized debt instruments (chaired by Thailand); working  \ngroup 2\u2014Regional credit guarantee and investment mechanism (the PRC and the Republic of Korea); working  \ngroup 3\u2014Foreign exchange transaction and settlement issues (Malaysia); and working group 4\u2014Rating systems  \nand dissemination of information (Japan and Singapore). In addition to the four working groups are: (i) the TA  \ncoordination team for the focal group (Indonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines); and (ii) the Ad-hoc support team for \nthe focal group, an apex body that oversees overall ABMI progress. \n5   EMEAP initiatives include enhancing the demand side of bond market development through Asian Bond Fund 1  \nand 2. APEC initiatives include diversifying of bond products.  \n6   The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 28 May 2008.  ", "2   \nborrowing  costs  in  global  credit  markets.  This  makes  clear  that  Asian  economies  remain  \nvulnerable to large fluctuations in global capital flows. Efficient capital markets in the region \nwould therefore help Asia recycle its vast savings within the region, reduce borrowing costs, and \nprovide more financing opportunities. Securitization schemes have the potential to become a  \ntool to fund the region\u2019s massive financing needs and provide credit support for the loans of \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises, long-term residential mortgages, and future cash flows \nsuch as remittances. \n \n5.  Securitization is a means of credit risk transfer that can support financial development  \nand  help  bridge  the  gap  between  prevailing  ASEAN+3  credit  quality  and  investor  risk  \npreferences. The process usually uses pooled assets or income (including future cash flows),  \nconfigured to provide a  yield that investors find attractive over extended periods. This can help \nmore Asian issuers obtain better credit ratings and expand their financing options. Securitization \nwould therefore widen the pool of issuers and diversify the existing bond products, for issuers \nand investors, available in the region\u2019s financial markets. \n \n6.  In the US and Europe, securitization is a well-developed technique that has contributed  \nto the expansion of debt markets (subject to discussion in para. 9 below) and attracted investors \nfrom around the world. Despite the growth of the ASEAN+3 securitization market since the \n1997\u20131998 financial crisis,7 the use of securitization in the region remains modest and its capital  \nmarkets are generally slow to tap its benefits.8  \n \n7.  Unlike  in  the  US  and  Europe,  the  financial  infrastructure  in  ASEAN+3  is  currently \ninadequate for securitization. For example, the lack of regulatory framework in these countries  \nadds to the cost and effort of securitization. Data collection is insufficient and makes monitoring \nof assets difficult. Transaction costs9 are also relatively high because each transaction is unique \nand the securitization process is relatively non-standardized. This means that services specific \nto the transaction, such as documentation and legal costs, tend to be high. In addition, new  \nsecuritization applications (e.g., microfinance), lacking history, may be difficult to structure and  \ndistribute. As a result, there is no incentive for corporate players and intermediaries to consider  \nsecuritization as an alternative form of financing. The benefits of securitization are nonetheless \nwell documented and acknowledged (footnote 7): it is therefore imperative to explore innovative  \nways to improve structures to achieve higher ratings and lower costs for the borrower.  \n \n8.  Because  of  the  availability  in  different  countries  of  various  types  of  assets  for \nsecuritization,  one  of  the  biggest  challenges  for  securitization  lies  in  developing  legal  and \nregulatory  frameworks.  Globally,  securitization  laws  have  been  changing  to  facilitate \nsecuritization.  In  the  ASEAN+3  region,  several  common  issues  need  to  be  addressed: \n(i) uncertainty in accounting treatment; (ii) bankruptcy law, especially relating to bankruptcy \nremoteness in various jurisdictions; and (iii) insufficient data on underlying assets. These result \nin  inefficient,  illiquid  markets  and  high  funding  costs.  It  is  therefore  crucial  that  ASEAN+3  \nmembers work collectively toward finding common solutions10 to these and related issues. One  \nissue would be the promotion of cross-border  securitization transactions. Region-wide best \npractice guidelines in securitization for the ASEAN+3 countries should also be developed.11  \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2007. Asia Bond Monitor. Manila (April).  \n8   Gyntelberg, J., and E.M. Remolona.  2006.  Securitization in Asia and the Pacific. BIS Quarterly Review. Basel: Bank \nfor International Settlements (BIS).

(83). \n11  There are region-wide and national level best practice  guidelines for securitization, e.g., European  Securitization \nForum's Securitization Market Practice Guidelines, for which compliance is voluntary; the Korean Asset-Backed  \n ", "  3 \n \n9.  Recent events such as the subprime mortgage crisis in 2007 have affected financial \nmarkets, particularly in Europe and North America. Although the direct consequences of the  \ncrisis on the region may be limited, analysts predict that the immediate and long-term effects of \nthe shock in the context of securitized instruments may include the following: (i) a change in  \ntransaction costs resulting from higher regulatory capital or changes in structure, particularly \ntransaction warehousing; (ii) a more conservative phase of deal formation and regulation; (iii) a  \nlong-term  change  in  the  regulatory  setting  covering  accounting  and  capital  requirements;  \n(iv) modifications in rating agencies\u2019 involvement in structured finance;12 and (v) changes in the \nresponsibilities of originators, intermediaries, and investors in dealing with moral hazard. The  \nimpact of these changes would therefore be of concern in developing Asia\u2019s securitization  \nmarket. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL  ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA aims to develop the domestic and regional bond markets in the ASEAN+3  \nregion. The expected outcome is for ASEAN+3  officials to make informed decisions based on  \nconcrete  and  feasible  policy  recommendations  to  promote  domestic  and  cross-border \ninvestments in securitized transactions. The TA will cover the ASEAN+3 countries, focusing on  \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam.13   \n \n11.  The TA supports ADB\u2019s Office of Regional Economic Integration (OREI) and the regional  \ncooperation and integration strategy, particularly pillar 3 (monetary and financial cooperation and \nintegration), which encourages the development of regional bond markets to (i) support regional \nfinancial  cooperation  and  integration  through  increased  cross-border    transactions,  and \n(ii) promote greater financial stability in the region. The study complements activities to promote  \nsecuritization  projects  by  ADB\u2019s  regional  departments  and  Private  Sector  Operations \nDepartment.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  All stages of the study will be done in consultation with market participants through  \nmeetings and/or conferences and will increase existing dialogue with other stakeholders and  \npolicy makers. The design will be relatively flexible to accommodate views, obtained throughout \nimplementation,  from  the  private  sector  and   from  government  officials.  ADB  and  the  TA \nconsultants will communicate regularly with  the chair and members of working group 1 to  \ndiscuss  output  and  to  develop  policy  recommendations.  With  preliminary  agreement  from  \nworking group 1 members, the study will include the following components. \n \n13.  Securitization Market Review and Lessons. The TA will analyze existing securitization  \ntechniques and identify impediments in the respective markets of the ASEAN+3 countries. It will  \nalso identify issues common to ASEAN+3 countries and impediments that hinder cross-border \nsecuritization transactions in the region. Current securitization techniques in the US, Europe,  \n                                                                                                                                                           \nSecurities Best Practice, jointly prepared by the Korean regulators and the private sector; and the American  \nSecuritization Forum Market Recommended Standards and Practices.   \n12  Arner, D., Lejot, P., and L.

The study  \nwill examine the subprime crisis and discuss the impact on the region\u2019s securitization market. It \nwill use the findings of recent OREI publications, in particular the April 2007 Asia Bond Monitor \nand the Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 12 Securitization in East  \nAsia, which included chapters on securitization. Other ADB studies will also be leveraged to \nmaximize efficiency and avoid duplication.15  \n \n14.  Securitization Scheme(s). The study will suggest innovative schemes that would  help \ngenerate cross-border issuance/investment and develop the domestic capital markets within the \nASEAN+3 region. It will discuss the developmental benefits of introducing new underlying assets  \nand recommend the various underlying assets16 available for securitization. It will also analyze  \nthe rationale and benefits of securitization. The study will (i) identify the necessary conditions for  \ntrading  the  securitized  assets  and  ways  to  enhance  liquidity  in  the  secondary  market;  \n(ii) recommend a securitization structure that matches investor demand/risk preferences17 and \nminimizes transaction costs; and (iii) evaluate the risk management issues and financial risk \nexposure of relevant parties and, in particular,  risk mitigation for recent developments such as \nthe subprime crisis.18 For underdeveloped markets, a reference sheet19 may be drawn up for the  \ncountry to monitor its progress in developing its capital market for such a scheme.  \n \n15.  Case Studies and Best Practice. The study will examine the role of government in the  \ndevelopment of each country\u2019s securitization market and in cross-border securitization. Based  \non the above analysis and lessons, the study will generate a set of standards, best practices, \nand  policy  recommendations,  including  market  infrastructure  and  conditions,  necessary  to  \npromote securitization structures in the ASEAN+3 countries. The study will analyze possible  \nstandardized schemes, such as master trust transactions backed by assets, originated by multi-\nsellers. It will also create a self-assessment template for ASEAN+3 governments to assess each \ncountry\u2019s progress toward removing impediments, and facilitate the development of efficient \nsecuritization  markets.  Case  studies  will  be  prepared  to  help  governments  review  their \nrespective capital markets development strategies and determine the necessary changes to  \nencourage both domestic and cross-border  securitization transactions. \n \n                                                 \n14 For example, Malaysia\u2019s efforts and success in developing the Sukuk market. In September 2006, the Government \nof Malaysia's investment house (Khazanah Nasional Berhad) issued a $750 million Islamic exchangeable bond. \n15 ADB has undertaken several projects and studies on securitization over  the years, including; Arner, Lejot, and  \nSchou-Zibell. 2008.

This RETA  \nintends to examine issues that have not been discussed, e.g., cross-border securitization, development of region-\nwide best practices/guidelines for securitization, and impact of recent developments (such as subprime issues). \n16 Student loans, housing loans, future flow  assets (e.g., remittance receivables, export receivables), and other new  \nasset classes could be explored. Under ADB. 2006. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of  \nDirectors on a Proposed Guarantee for the Diversified Payment Rights Securitization by Alliance Bank JSC  \n(Republic of Kazakhstan). Manila (Project 40936 and Investment No. 7246), the Diversified Payment Rights  \ngenerated from several commercial transactions (including  exports of goods or services, foreign direct investments,  \noverseas transportation receipts, and foreign worker remittances) could also be explored. \n17  The study  will explore the possible underlying assets that can be securitized by  identifying the region\u2019s needs, to \nwhich will be matched the demand for securitized assets so that the scheme will not be  a \u201cone-off\u201d transaction, as  \nmany  are in Asia. \n18   Scatigna, M., and C.E. Tovar. 2007. Securitization in Latin America. BIS Quarterly Review. Basel: BIS (September).\n19  The reference sheet will loosely  define the measures to be taken to meet objectives deemed most critical for the \ndevelopment of securitization, such as the macro political environment or the regulatory  and reporting framework. It  \nis to be used as a template to guide preparation of more  detailed documents. For a comparative overview of the  \ncharacteristics of several Asian markets, refer to ADB. 2005. ADB Bond Monitor 2005. Manila. (25\u201328).  \n ", "  5 \n16.  Policy Recommendations. The study will recommend a policy framework to foster a  \nfavorable environment for the development of cross-border securitization. It will (i) consider the  \ngovernment\u2019s role in promoting market and legal harmonization for cross-border securitization  \ntransactions;  (ii)  explore  cooperation  in  region-wide  credit  rating,  accounting,  and  credit \nguarantee systems; and (iii) examine other ways to enhance the liquidity of issued securitized \nassets. A set of recommendations will be submitted to working group 1 on measures that may \nbe adopted by the individual ASEAN+3 countries and regional cooperation efforts that may be  \nundertaken to enable securitization and cross-border securitization transactions.  \n  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at the equivalent of $700,000 which will be financed  \non a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The detailed  \ncost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. The ASEAN+3 member countries will  \nfinance the costs of their individual participation in working group 1 activities. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA,  which  will  be  administered  and \nimplemented by OREI in close collaboration with working group 1 member countries, particularly \nThailand (the working group 1 chair). ADB will supervise the work of the TA consultants. \n \n19.  Three international consultants (a financial market specialist, a structured finance legal \nand regulatory specialist, and a securitization specialist) and one national consultant (project  \ncoordinator)  will  be  engaged  for  a  total  of  17  person-months  of  international  consultancy \nservices and 12 person-months of national consultancy services. They will be engaged by ADB  \nas individual consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as  \namended from time to time). The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months; it  is expected to start in July 2008 and end  \nin June 2009. A series of market consultations with market players and government officials will  \nbe held within 5 months of commencement. With these inputs, as well as those from government  \nofficials,  the  interim  report  will  be  submitted  to  working  group  1  within  6  months.  A  final  \npresentation to working group 1 is expected in June 2009. The outline of the final report is in  \nAppendix 4. Upon completion, the report will be disseminated within ADB and on appropriate  \nwebsites,20  with  external  publication  of  the  report  subject  to  approval  by  working  group  1  \nmembers.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the  \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 on a grant basis for  \nDeveloping Securitization Markets in ASEAN+3 Region, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n                                                 \n20  For example, Asian Bonds Online. www.asianbondsonline.adb.org \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions \nSummary   and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nDeveloped local  Higher trading volume of  Bond market data and  \u2022 Commitment of \ncurrency bond   local currency bonds from   internet (Asian Bonds  ASEAN+3 governments  \nmarkets will reduce  $6 trillion in 2007 to at least  Online)  to continue reforms to \nfinancial  double in 5 years    promote national and \nvulnerabilities and      regional securitization \nencourage the use of  Increased size of local  Asia Bond Monitor  market strategies \nAsian savings within  currency bond issuance  \u2022 Capital market conditions \nthe ASEAN+3 region  from $3.5 trillion in 2007 to  remain stable not only in \n  at least double in 5 years   ASEAN+3 but also in the \n    global market  \n   \n  Risk \n\u2022 ASEAN+3 governments  \nfail to adopt reforms \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nInformed decision by   At least 3 ASEAN+3   Market consultation with  \u2022  Relative stability of the \nASEAN+3 officials in  member countries consider   ASEAN+3 member  financial sector \ndeveloping   adopting the  countries  \u2022  Underlying assets eligible \nsecuritization markets  recommendations of the    for securitization  \n  policy by 2009     \n    Risk \n  \u2022  ASEAN+3 governments  \nfail to adopt reforms \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
