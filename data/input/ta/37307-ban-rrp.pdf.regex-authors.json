The achievement of gender parity in \nenrollment  numbers  has  made  these  increases  even  more  notable. \nGrowth has been met through the fast growth of nongovernment schools \nand  madrasah,  which  together  comprise  more  than  95%  of  schools. \nAlthough  the  Government  is  not  the  main  provider  of  secondary \neducation, financing assistance is offered to the large majority, mainly in \nthe form of salary subsidies.  \n \nHowever, monitoring and evaluation to ensure the quality of the rapidly \nincreasing numbers of schools and madrasah have been challenging \nwithin  the  small-scale  management  system  of  the  relevant  education \nagencies. As a result, the quality of education and educational outcomes \nremains  a major  issue.  Dropout  and  failure  rates  across  the  general \nsecondary schools and madrasah remain high. Other problems include \nunsuitable curricula and examinations, poor textbooks, and ineffective \nteaching for the majority of students.  \n \nThe lack of central and decentralized systems for monitoring, evaluation, \nand quality assurance for school support and development remain the \ncentral  concern.  If  this  issue  is  not  addressed,  the  poor  quality  of \nsecondary  education  will  continue.  More  extensive  and  effective \ndecentralization  of  responsibilities  and  functions,  improved  operations \nand  management  systems,  and  more  effective  human  resources \nmanagement  are  necessary  to  ensure  modern  professional \nspecialization.  \n \nSystematic  targeting  and  support  to  identified  underserved  areas  of \nsecondary education is reducing access problems. Continuing targeted \nsupport is required to preserve enrollment gains. However, wider issues \nof access to quality schooling remain, particularly in underserved areas. \nThese are increasing with the establishment of new schools in already \nwell-served areas.  \n \nTo  address  these  issues  of  management,  quality,  and  access  in  the \nsecondary  education  subsector,  the  Government  is  implementing  the \nSecondary Education Sector Development Plan (SE-SDP) 2000\u20132010, \nwhich has been updated and its implementation period extended to 2013. \nThe updated plan, or SE-SDP 2006\u20132013, is designed to deepen and \n ", "iv \nextend the reforms nationally, with a view to (i) increasing efficiency in \nthe management and monitoring of secondary education; (ii) improving \nthe  relevance  of  the  curricula  and  learning  of  students,  including  in \nmadrasah; and (iii) increasing access to secondary education, particularly \nfor the poor and underserved areas. The updated plan adds three new \nareas  for  system  reform  and  development:  modernizing  and \nstrengthening  the  management  and  quality  of  madrasah,  ensuring \naccess  to  training  for  contemporary  information  and  communication \ntechnology for all secondary students, and poverty-targeted provision of \nstipends. \n \nUnder this development plan, the Government, with the assistance of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) through the Secondary Education Sector \nImprovement Project (SESIP), recently has developed and adopted a \nnumber  of  reforms.  These  include  (i)  school  strengthening  through \ndecentralized  School  Performance-Based  Management  System \n(SPBMS), (ii) a national Education Management and Information System \n(EMIS),  (iii)  revision  of  grades  9\u201310  curricula  to  make  them  more \nrelevant, (iv) introduction of school-based assessment (SBA), and (v) \nrevised  public  examination.  These  reforms  are  not  fully  operational \nnationally or fully institutionalized. Similar initiatives to address serious \nquality  problems  in  government-supported  madrasah  (and  other \nmadrasah) are also now a key secondary education development priority. \n   \nProgram Loan  The Secondary Education Sector Development Program (SESDP) will \nsupport the implementation of the updated SE-SDP 2006\u20132013. SESDP \ncomprises a program loan and a project loan. The objective is to reduce \npoverty  in  Bangladesh,  through  human  resource  development,  by \nimproving the relevance of secondary education to the needs of the labor \nmarket. Relevant and quality education will support the continued social \nand economic development of Bangladesh, which, in turn, will expand \nemployment opportunities for its population.    \n   \nImpact and  The  program  loan  will  support  the  implementation  of  policy  reforms \nOutcome  identified in SE-SDP 2000\u20132010 and SE-SDP 2006\u20132013 to achieve (i) \nstrengthened management and governance of secondary education, (ii) \nenhanced  quality  of  secondary  education  learning,  and  (iii)  more \nequitable access to secondary education. \n \nThe salient features of the policy matrix include (i) decentralization of \nsecondary  education  management,  (ii)  national  implementation  of  a \ndecentralized  EMIS,  (iii)  national  implementation  of  SPBMS,  (iv) \nfunctional specialization of the education cadre, (v) revision of curricula in \ngrades  9\u201310,  (vi)  reform  of  the  Secondary  School  Certificate  (SSC) \nexaminations, (vii) introduction of SBA for grades 6\u20139, and (viii) review of \nthe female secondary stipends program. \n   \nFinancing Plan  As proposed, ADB will support the Government\u2019s secondary education \nreform package by providing a single tranche program loan of $30 million \nin various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 20,292,000 \nfrom ADB\u2019s Asian Development Fund (ADF) resources. The loan will \n ", "    v     \nhave an amortization period of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 \nyears, and with an annual interest charge of 1.0% during the grace period \nand 1.5% thereafter. \n   \nProgram Period  1 January 2006 to 31 December 2008 \n   \nProcurement  The program loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange \ncost  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries, \nexcluding items included in a list of ineligible items and imports financed \nby other bilateral and multilateral sources. The Borrower will certify that \nthe volume of eligible imports exceeds the amount of ADB\u2019s projected \ndisbursements under the program loan in a given period. ADB will have \nthe right to audit the use of the loan proceeds, and to verify the accuracy \nof the Borrower\u2019s certification.  \n   \nProject Loan   The project loan will focus on improving the efficiency and quality of \nImpact and  secondary  education,  while  enhancing  access.  The  Project  will  have \nOutcome  three  outputs:  (i)  strengthened  management  of,  and  transparency  in, \nsecondary education; (ii) higher quality secondary education; and (iii) \nmore equitable access to secondary education. \n   \nFinancing Plan  As  proposed,  a  project  loan  of  $85.0  million  in  various  currencies \nequivalent to Special Drawing Rights 57,493,000 from ADB\u2019s ADF will be \nprovided to finance 75% of the project costs. The proposed term will be \n32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an annual interest \ncharge of 1% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  31 December 2012  \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2013  \nCompletion Date \n   \nProcurement and  Procurement of goods and services will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nDisbursement  Procurement  Guidelines,  April  2006.  Disbursements  will  be  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  Consultants \nfinanced  from  the  proceeds  of  the  ADB  loans  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, April 2006. \n   \nExecuting Agency  The Executing Agency for the Project will be the Ministry of Education \nImplementation  (MOE),  while  the  Implementing  Agency  will  be  the  Directorate  of \nArrangements  Secondary  and  Higher  Education  (DSHE).  DSHE  will  have  overall \nresponsibility  for  planning,  organizing,  managing,  supervising, \ncoordinating,  and  monitoring  the  Project,  as  well  as  monitoring  the \nprogress achieved. The structure of the project implementation unit (PIU) \nof SESIP will be retained and continue to function as the PIU of SESDP. \nThe PIU will be responsible for day-to-day project implementation. Given \nthe project loan\u2019s support for SE-SDP 2006\u20132013, its implementation will \nbe coordinated with the ongoing Teaching Quality Improvement Project. \nDistrict  implementation  coordination  committees  (DICC)  will  be \nestablished in each district where the Project finances subprojects to \ncoordinate  the civil  works  program.  Each  DICC  will  be  chaired  by  a \n \n ", "vi \ndeputy  commissioner.  Various  education  agencies  will  implement \ndifferent components of the Project. \n \n  A project steering committee (PSC) will be set up, chaired by the MOE \nsecretary. The PSC will be responsible for the detailed policy formulation, \nplanning, implementation, and evaluation of the reform agenda for the \nsecondary education system under SESDP, including all policy reforms \nwithin  the program  that  will  help  implement  the  SE-SDP  2006\u20132013. \nSince  the  PSC  is  expected  to  address  long-term  policy  issues  of \nsecondary  education,  its  membership  will  be  flexible.  Appropriate \npersons  and  specialists  will  be  invited,  as  required.  A  project \nimplementation committee, chaired by the DSHE director general, will be \nestablished to oversee day-to-day project implementation. \n   \nImpact, Benefits,  SESDP will contribute to improving the management and efficiency of the \nand Beneficiaries  secondary education sector. The decentralization of responsibilities and \ncreation  of  new  posts  at  the  zone  and  district  levels  will  improve \nunderstanding  of  the  local  situation,  contributing  to  faster  decision \nmaking;  and  will  increase  proximity  to  stakeholders,  facilitating  the \nresolution of secondary education management issues. DSHE capacity \nwill  be  strengthened  to  improve  management.  Putting  into  place  a \nmonitoring  and  quality  assurance  system  will  help  the  Government \nimprove  assistance  to  poorly  performing  schools,  and  halt  salary \nsubsidies  where  applicable.  This  will  increase  the  transparency  of \ndecisions relating to payments of salary subsidies, which, in turn, should \nfacilitate  quality  improvements.  Revision  of  curricula  through  effective \npreparation  in  reading,  writing,  numerical  skills,  and  work  attitudes, \namong  others,  as  well  as  analytical  thinking,  will  make  them  more \nrelevant to the labor market.     \n \nSESDP  aims  to  improve  the  quality  and  efficiency  of  secondary \neducation. Higher quality secondary education will improve learning, as \nwell as make it more relevant, and help reinforce the idea among parents \nthat  attending  school  is  a  productive  activity  and  an  investment  in \nchildren\u2019s  futures.  The  direct  poverty  impacts  of  the  Program  are \nexpected  to  be  positive.  Reforms  that  strengthen  management  and \ngovernance of secondary education will benefit secondary schools where \npoor  and  nonpoor  students  are  enrolled.  However,  higher  quality \nsecondary education will benefit particularly poor students, who cannot \nafford high-priced private schools and private tutorial sessions. Curricula \nthat are based on learning-skills and develop attitudes and skills for work \nwill increase the relevance of education to the labor market. Modernized \nmadrasah education will increase the competitive chances of children \nwho  graduate  from  madrasah  and  seek  higher  education  and \nemployment,  in  addition  to  learning  life  skills  for  participation  in  the \nglobalized  economic  and  social  environment.  Civil  works  will  help \nimprove  the  learning  environment  in  crowded  schools  enrolling  girls. \nConstruction  of  new  secondary  schools  in  underserved  areas,  and \nprovision of poverty-targeted stipends, will reduce opportunity costs of \nattending secondary school. This should further encourage students from \npoor households to continue attending secondary school.   \n ", "    vii     \n \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  increase  access  to  secondary  education. \nAnnually, the 56 new schools that are planned will benefit an additional \n16,800  students,  while the  560  additional  classrooms  in schools  and \nmadrasah will benefit more than 22,000 secondary school students. By \n2013, civil works, stipend assistance, and improvements in education \nquality are expected to increase enrollment rates by 15% and raise SSC \npass rates by 5%. Further, with the expected increase in enrollments and \ngreater  pressure  on  resources,  dropout  rates  at  a  minimum  are \nenvisaged to be retained at the 2004 level. Closer monitoring of school \nperformance  will  increase  the  cost  efficiency  of  the  Government\u2019s \nexpenditures in the secondary education subsector.   \n   \nRisks and  SESDP  assumes  a  high  level  of  commitment  from  Government  to \nAssumptions  implement  the  adopted  reforms.  Any  risk  related  to  backtracking  of \nreforms  is  mitigated  by  the  reforms\u2019  links  to  the  wider  long-term \nframeworks  in  the  sector,  including  (i)  reforms  recommended  in \nBangladesh\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy,  (ii)  consultations  with \nstakeholders during development and implementation, and (iii) activities \nto inform the public of these reforms and allay concerns. In addition, the \nissues being addressed by SESDP are at the heart of improving the \nquality of, and increasing access to, secondary education, which any \ngovernment will have to address.  \n \nThe implementation of reforms requires coordination by MOE and DSHE \nwith education agencies and other stakeholders. Stakeholders will be \nrepresented in the project implementation arrangements to facilitate the \ncoordination of activities across agencies. Project activities will support \nstronger  coordination  and  less  overlap  of  responsibilities  across  the \neducation agencies. The capacity of relevant stakeholders also will be \nstrengthened.  Changes  to  curricula,  and  student  assessments  and \nexaminations, will be disseminated widely to the public in a timely and \ncareful  manner  to  build  confidence.  In  addition,  stakeholders  will  be \nconsulted on new curricula, assessments, and examinations. \n \nThe sustainability of reforms (e.g., SPBMS, SBA, and others) beyond the \nreform  period  assumes  that  staff  will  be  available  to  continue  their \nimplementation. A financial analysis suggests that, if all other things are \nconstant, sufficient resources will be available to secondary education to \ncontinue  the  reforms.  Improved  monitoring  of  school  performance  in \nrelation to the continuation of salary subventions will increase efficiencies \nand  contribute  to  financial  savings  in  the  sector.  Reforms  relating  to \ndecentralization  and  functional  specialization  will  institutionalize  new \npositions.  \n ", "ix\n89o  00'E 91o  45'E\nBANGLADESH\nSECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR\nPanchagarh DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM\nThakurgaon\nNilphamari\nLalmonirhat N\nSaidpur\nRangpur Kurigram\n25 o 30'N Dinajpur Parbatipur Teesta R. 0 25 50 75 25 o 30'N\nKilometers\nI N D I A Gaibandha\nBahadurabad\n   Ferry Tamabil\nJoypurhat Sunamganj\nSherpur Chhatak\nBogra JamJamalpur Brahmaputra R.

THE PROPOSAL  \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on two proposed \nloans to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Secondary Education Sector Development \nProgram (SESDP).  \n \nII.   THE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES1  \n \nA.   Sector Description and Performance \n \n2.  Secondary  Education  Sector  Development  Plan  2000\u20132010.  In  1998,  the \nGovernment of Bangladesh, with Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance, prepared the \nSecondary  Education  Sector  Development  Plan  (SE-SDP)  2000\u20132010  to  address  the \nconsequences of the rising demand for secondary education following the rapid increase in \nprimary  education  participation.  While  the  number  of  secondary  schools,  enrollments,  and \nteachers had expanded quickly, improvements in planning, management, teacher provision, \ncurricula, and assessment capacity were required to ensure the maintenance of system quality, \naccess, and equity.   \n \n3.  The SE-SDP2 report noted that the magnitude of the problems\u2014and the resources \nrequired to overcome them\u2014had inhibited change. However, the report stated that change \ncould occur with continuity of policy, commitment, and political will among decision makers. The \nstrategic objectives of SE-SDP were to extend basic education to 8 years, and to restructure \nand improve secondary education. The plan involved (i) extending basic education to grade 8;  \n(ii) reforming and improving the quality of secondary education; (iii) improving policy research \nand  development,  planning,  and  management  of  secondary  education;  and  (iv)  expanding \naccess to secondary education.   \n \n4.  Recent Government Strategies. Since the preparation of SE-SDP, the Government \nissued  several  major  reports  and  national  policy  statements.  These  included  the \nrecommendations of the National Education Commission (NEC) 2003\u20132004 and Bangladesh\u2019s \noverarching poverty reduction strategy (PRS), Unlocking the Potential: National Strategy for \nAccelerated Poverty Reduction,3 which was launched in October 2005. \n \n5.  NEC recognized that the quality of secondary education was decreasing gradually. \nSecondary  School  Certificate  (SSC)  examination  results  painted  a  disappointing  picture. \nAgainst  this  backdrop,  NEC  recommended  policy  guidelines  for  education  administration; \ninfrastructure and environment; curriculum, teaching methods, and evaluation; social status of \nteachers;  and  teacher  training.  Addressing  education  administration,  NEC  recommended \ndecentralization of secondary education administration at the division, district, and upazila \n(subdistrict)  levels;  and  the  creation  of  a  separate  directorate  for  secondary  education. \nFocusing on education quality, NEC suggested (i) provision of laboratory equipment in school \nlaboratories; (ii) modernization of curriculum and syllabus; (iii) improvement of curriculum, \nteaching methods, and student evaluation; (iv) inclusion of core subjects in madrasah and \nvocational curriculum; and (v) introduction of school-based assessment (SBA). To improve \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for Preparing the Secondary Education \nSector Improvement Project II. Manila. \n2  The 1998 SE-SDP was based, for the most part, on the analysis, policies, and objectives outlined in the 1997 \nReport of the National Education Policy Formulation Committee, as well as on a review of the secondary education \nsector analyses conducted by United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and United Nations Educational, \nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and ADB in 1992, and subsequent studies.   \n3  Planning  Commission.  2005.  Unlocking  the  Potential:  National  Strategy  for  Accelerated  Poverty  Reduction. \nGovernment of Bangladesh: Dhaka. \n ", "2 \nteaching quality, NEC proposed training for all subject teachers, development of a career path \nfor teachers, and capacity development of teacher training colleges. \n \n6.  The PRS considers education reform one of the main ways to achieve poverty reduction. \nMajor recommendations for secondary education include reforms to education management, \ne.g., decentralization and school-based management; improvement in teaching quality, e.g., \ndeveloping teachers' career paths; addressing equity and gender gaps; and improved education \nperformance. The main policy interventions of the PRS for secondary education include (i) \nrestructuring management to improve the quality of education, (ii) developing curricula, (iii) \nenhancing teachers\u2019 education, (iv) promoting access to secondary and higher education, (v) \nfacilitating gender equity in education and empowering women, and (vi) preventing dropouts at \nthe secondary and higher secondary level.  \n \n7.  Progress of Reforms Under SE-SDP. During SE-SDP implementation up to 2006, the \nGovernment undertook significant development activities and adopted some major reforms in \nthe  secondary  education  subsector.  To  improve  the  quality  of  secondary  education,  the \nGovernment (i) revised the curricula of grades 9 and 10, which were notified for adoption; (ii) \ndeveloped and notified for adoption a new style of examinations; (iii) approved the phased \nprivatization of textbook publication; and (iv) adopted a teacher education policy for pre- and in-\nservice  training.  To  improve  policy  research,  planning,  and  management  of  secondary \neducation,  the  Government  adopted  a  School  Performance-Based  Management  System \n(SPBMS) and a national Education Management and Information System (EMIS). To increase \naccess to secondary education, school facilities were developed in underserved areas, and \nfemale students were provided with stipends. Extension of basic education to grade 8 has not \nbeen adopted for implementation.  \n \n8.  Updating the SE-SDP. Through continuing dialogue with ADB and other development \npartners, the Government reviewed its achievements and current constraints in the provision of \nsecondary education. With ADB support, the Government updated SE-SDP and extended its \nimplementation  period  to  2013.  This  is  reflected  in  SE-SDP  2006\u20132013  (Supplementary \nAppendix  A),  which  deepens  and  extends  reforms  nationally  with  a  view  to  (i)  increasing \nefficiency  in  the  management  and  monitoring  of  secondary  education;  (ii)  improving  the \nrelevance of the curriculum and learning of students, including in madrasah; and (iii) increasing \naccess to secondary education, particularly for the poor and underserved. The updated plan \nconsolidates  and  continues  the  initiatives  started  under  SE-SDP  that  have  proven  to  be \nappropriate  strategies  for  addressing  the  identified  issues.  Further,  the  updated  SE-SDP \nincludes three new key areas for reform: modernization and strengthening of the management \nand  quality  of  madrasah,  ensuring  access  to  training  for  contemporary  information  and \ncommunications technology (ICT) for all secondary students, and provision of poverty-targeted \nstipends.  \n \n9.  ADB Support to Secondary Education Reforms. ADB is committed to helping the \nGovernment achieve its goals in education, which are set out in the Bangladesh PRS and the \nMillennium  Development  Goals.  The  reform  initiatives  (para.  7)  and  supporting  investment \nactivities were developed and piloted with ADB assistance, through the Secondary Education \nSector Improvement Project (SESIP)4 (Appendix 1). \n \n10.  To support education management improvements, SESIP assisted in the development \nand piloting of SPBMS and EMIS. To improve the quality of secondary education, SESIP (i) \nsupported revisions to the curricula for grades 9 and 10, (ii) developed model SSC examination \npapers, (iii) developed and piloted SBA, and (iv) developed a new teacher education policy and \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1999.

Some of the policy recommendations originating from these \noutputs, such as SPBMS and national EMIS, have been notified officially for national adoption \nby the Government.  \n \n11.  Based on the studies and recommendations of SESIP for improving teaching quality and \nteacher education in secondary education, the Teaching Quality Improvement in Secondary \nEducation  Project  (TQI) 5  was  prepared.  The  TQI  project  is  supporting  the  sustainable \ndevelopment of teacher training.  \n \n12.  ADB Country Strategy. ADB\u2019s assistance to the education sector of Bangladesh over \nthe past decade has encompassed project-specific activities that included building schools and \nincreasing policy dialogue to complement project activities. In primary education, ADB is the \nlead  agency  for  the  Second  Primary  Education  Development  Program6 (Appendix  2).  In \nsecondary education, SESIP was designed as the first stage of investments that would provide \nthe foundation for subsequent ADB assistance in the subsector under SE-SDP. TQI supports \nSE-SDP and its update. The ADB country strategy and program,7 through the inclusion of the \nSESDP as follow-on assistance to SESIP, continues ADB\u2019s support to the Government in \nadvancing  secondary  education  reforms,  builds  on  the  progress  made  in  SESIP,  and \ncomplements TQI.   \n \n13.  Secondary Education Performance. Secondary education in Bangladesh is offered in \ngeneral  secondary  schools  and  religious  schools,  or  madrasah  (Appendix  3).  In  schools, \nsecondary education has three levels: junior secondary, grades 6\u20138; secondary grades 9\u201310; \nand  higher  secondary,  or  intermediate,  grades  11\u201312.  Alia  madrasah8 offer  religious  and \ngeneral subjects at the primary level, grades 1\u20135; junior secondary and secondary level, grades \n6\u201310 (dakhil); higher secondary level, grades 11\u201312 (alim); and degree (fazil) and masters \n(kamil)  levels.  Education  in  Bangladesh  is  administered  by  two  ministries.  The  Ministry  of \nPrimary and Mass Education is responsible for primary education, grades 1\u20135, both formal and \ninformal. The Ministry of Education (MOE), through the Directorate of Secondary and Higher \nEducation  (DSHE),  is  responsible  for  secondary,  madrasah,  technical  and  vocational,  and \ntertiary education.  \n \n14.  Bangladesh is making significant achievements in secondary education. Focusing on \ngrades 6\u201310, the Government has increased the gross enrollment rate from 30.2% in 1993 to \n45.2% in 2003. The enrollment of girls has been particularly noteworthy: Gender parity in \nsecondary enrollment was achieved in 2000. In 2003, girls comprised 53% of enrolled students \nin general schools and 52% in madrasah. Female gross enrollment rate rose from 28.7% in \n1993 to 50.8% in 2003. General secondary schools accounted for 83% of the enrollment. \nAccess to secondary education, however, still varies between rural and urban areas, particularly \nmetropolitan areas. An indicator of this disparity is the student-teacher ratio, which is 40:1 in \nrural areas and 28:1 in urban areas. \n \n15.  Secondary education in Bangladesh is characterized by public-private partnerships. Of \nthe  17,386  secondary  schools  offering  grades  6\u201310  in  2003,  only  1.8%  were  government \nschools.  Meanwhile,  all  alia  madrasah  are  private  (nongovernment).  The  Government \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2004.

See \nAppendix 3 for descriptions. \n  \n ", "4 \nrecognizes nongovernment schools, mostly funded by communities, through the Boards of \nIntermediate and Secondary Education (BISE); and alia madrasah through the Bangladesh \nMadrasah Education Board (BMEB). Nongovernment institutions enroll 96% of all students in \ngrades 6\u201312. The large majority of nongovernment schools (88%) and madrasah (87%) receive \ngovernment funding through subsidies (also known as subventions) that cover about 90% of \nteacher salaries.  \n \n16.   Secondary education in Bangladesh is inefficient. The majority of children who enter \ngrade 6 complete grade 8 and enter grade 9, of whom about half enter grade 10. However, \nsubstantially less than 50% of those who enter grade 10 gain the SSC, the first of the secondary \npublic examinations, because of dropouts or failure during the year. In 2004, the national SSC \npass rate was 48%.9 In grades 6\u201310, the dropout rate is slightly higher for girls than for boys, \nparticularly at the end of grade 8. For the Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) at the end of \ngrade 12, the pattern is similar to that of SSC\u2014generally low pass rates, including 48% in 2004. \nThe results for SSC and HSC are now basically the same for girls and boys, with indications \nthat girls\u2019 overall results for HSC are moving ahead of those of boys. The dropout, completion, \nand pass rates in the public BMEB alia madrasahs' dakhil and alim examinations are generally \nsimilar to those of the general secondary schools under the Secondary Education Examination \nBoards. The majority of students who enter the alia madrasah drop out of school or fail the \nterminal public examination. \n \nB.   Issues and Opportunities \n \n17.  Secondary  Education  System  Management.  The  fast,  large-scale  growth  of \nsecondary education has been based almost entirely on the expansion of nongovernment \ninstitutions  supported  by  Government  through  salary  subventions.  The  rapidly  expanding \nnumber of schools and madrasah has made monitoring and evaluation for quality assurance \nand eligibility for subvention challenging for DSHE, with its traditional, small-scale management \ncapacity. As a result, poorly performing schools continue to receive subventions. The lack of \ncentral and decentralized systems for monitoring, evaluation, and quality assurance for school \nsupport and development remains the central concern. If this issue is not addressed, the poor \nquality of secondary education will continue. More extensive and effective decentralization of \nresponsibilities  and  functions,  improved  operational  and  management  systems,  and  more \neffective  human  resources  management  are  necessary  to  ensure  modern  professional \nspecialization.  \n \n18.  Recent reforms to strengthen schools through decentralized SPBMS and a functioning \nnational EMIS have established the initial systems for addressing some of these specific issues. \nHowever, these are not fully operational nationally or fully institutionalized. An extension of \nthese systems to the government-supported madrasah (alia madrasah) is also required.    \n \n19.  Quality of Secondary Education. The quality of education and educational outcomes \nremains a major issue. Dropout and failure rates across secondary schools and madrasah \nremain high. For most students, secondary education offers few opportunities for success. \nOther problems include unsuitable curricula and examinations, poor textbooks, and ineffective \nteaching for the majority of students.  \n \n20.  MOE recently adopted reforms that have initiated improved and more relevant curricula \nfor general secondary education, grades 9\u201310, after substantial strengthening of the National \nCurriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB). Parallel reforms of student assessment and public \nexaminations also have been approved. Further, new, modernized secondary teacher education \n                                                 \n9  The pass rate is calculated from the number of students who sit for the SSC examination. Not all students in grade \n10 are eligible to sit for the examination as schools pre-screen students. \n ", "    5     \nprograms  have  been  initiated  and  officially  approved,  and  legal  procedures  have  been \nestablished for the registration of secondary teachers. Consolidation, replication and extension, \nand institutionalization are now required. Similar initiatives to address serious quality problems \nin the alia madrasah are also now a secondary education development priority.  \n \n21.  Access and Equity.  As a result of efforts to improve the quality of primary education, \nthe number of students who complete primary education is expected to increase. As a result, \nmore general secondary education institutions will be required to achieve equity in access. \nAlthough systematic targeting and support to areas underserved by secondary education are \nreducing  access  problems,  such  targeting  must  continue  to  preserve  enrollment  gains. \nHowever, wider issues of access to quality schooling remain, particularly in underserved areas. \nThese are increasing with the establishment of new schools in already well-served areas.  \n \n22.  Female stipend assistance programs undoubtedly have contributed to the reversal of \ninequity of female enrollment in secondary schools, as girls now outnumber boys. However, \nstudies show that stipend recipients come mostly from nonpoor households. Thus, children from \npoor households have not benefited. Towards encouraging more poor students to enroll and \nstay in secondary grades, these assistance programs must be examined, and better targeting of \nneedy students\u2014boys and girls\u2014is required.    \n \n23.  External  Assistance.  The  secondary  education  subsector  of  Bangladesh  receives \nassistance from development partners. However, fewer development partners (Appendix 4) are \ninvolved, and provide less assistance, than in the primary education subsector. Until 2006, ADB \nprovided assistance through SESIP. Between 2006 and 2011, ADB will support improvements \nin teaching quality in secondary education through TQI. The World Bank is supporting an \neducation reform program covering the primary and secondary subsectors from 2005 to 2007. \nThe policy reforms complement the policies developed with SESIP assistance and adopted by \nthe Government, as well as those to be implemented under TQI and SESDP. These include (i) \neffective  system  management,  including  improved  enforcement  in  establishment  and \nregistration of institutions; (ii) more equitable access; (iii) greater transparency in financing \ninstitutions; (iv) improved accountability through monitoring of expenditures and outcomes; (v) \ncommunity  participation  in  school  management  and  devolution  of  authority;  (vi)  NCTB \nrestructuring;  (vii)  transparency  in  manuscript  approval;  and  (viii)  competition  in  textbook \nproduction.  The  government  of  Norway,  ADB,  and  World  Bank  are  supporting  the  female \nsecondary education stipend program, though this assistance extends only through 2006.  \n \n24.  Lessons Identified. The design of SESDP takes into consideration lessons identified \nfrom  past  education  assistance  in  Bangladesh  and  other  countries  (Appendix  5).  For  any \neducation sector project, a strategic action plan should be developed for the sector to provide \ndirections for future development. Focus should be on the long-term nature of the changes \ninitiated.  In  increasing  access  to  education,  assistance  should  be  provided  to  government \nschools, as well as to nongovernment and community schools, including those in poverty-\nstricken areas. As the success of school-based management depends on the participation and \nunderstanding of the role and responsibilities of local bodies, these groups should be included in \ncapacity  strengthening  efforts.  Changes  to  curricula,  and  student  assessments  and \nexaminations, will be disseminated widely to the public in a timely and careful manner to build \nconfidence. The Government absorbs increased salary costs slowly when these are not framed \nwithin a larger policy reform agenda. To minimize the loss of implementation momentum, follow-\non assistance should be initiated immediately after its predecessor, if not overlapping with it.  \n \n25.  SESDP is the follow-on assistance to SESIP in support of the secondary education \nsubsector development plan that spans a decade. The program aims to reach underserved \n ", "6 \nareas  and  provide  poverty-targeted  stipends.  Civil  works  for  new  schools  are  targeted  at \nunderserved areas, and recipients of additional classrooms will include nongovernment schools. \nTo facilitate the roles of school management committees (SMC), SESDP will provide capacity \nbuilding  support  to  SMC  officials.  SESDP  has  set  aside  resources  for  public  awareness \nprograms on curricula revisions, examination reform, and related activities. Reforms related to \ndecentralization and functional specialization will institutionalize new positions, which would \nfacilitate  the  Government\u2019s  absorption  of  increased  salary  costs.  Recognizing  the  need  to \nminimize restarting costs, SESDP follows immediately on the heels of its predecessor, SESIP.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n26.  The overall objective of the SESDP is to contribute to poverty reduction in Bangladesh, \nthrough human resource development, by improving the relevance of secondary education to \nthe needs of the labor market. SESDP aims to strengthen management, enhance quality, and \nimprove equity of access to secondary education. SESDP will support the implementation of the \nupdated  SE-SDP.  Relevant  and  quality  education  will  support  the  continued  social  and \neconomic development of Bangladesh, which, in turn, will expand employment opportunities for \nits  population.  The  program  and  sector-like  project  loans  will  complement  each  other  in \nachieving  progress  in  these  key  sectoral  objectives.  The  program  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 6. \n \nB.  Important Features \n \n27.  SESDP provides continuity of support to the reform process initiated under SESIP, as \nwell  as  to  the  Government\u2019s  reform  target  adjustments  in  accordance  with  its  recent \ndevelopment strategies. SESDP continues the policy dialogue undertaken by SESIP, and builds \nupon  the  project  achievements.  SESDP  integrates  and  enhances  other  ADB  assistance, \nbuilding upon experiences and maintaining the emphasis on quality, efficiency, and access \nimprovements in the secondary education subsector as part of the national poverty reduction \nagenda.  \n \n28.  The Government demonstrated strong commitment to the implementation of the initial \nphase of SE-SDP, including through increased resources for secondary education. The phasing \nin of reforms, particularly undertaking initial capacity building and piloting before nationwide \nimplementation, has mobilized support and ensured that the reform strategies are sound.   \n \n29.  The SESDP policy framework will provide additional support to the Government\u2019s efforts \nto reorient and continue the implementation of reforms. SESDP\u2019s combination of policy-based \nand investment lending is considered appropriate and timely at the current stage of secondary \neducation reform in Bangladesh, given (i) the Government\u2019s strong commitment to accelerate \nreform in the education sector; (ii) the magnitude of costs to implement the reforms; and (iii) the \nlarge investments required to meet the challenges of improving secondary education quality, \nincreasing access for girls and the poor, and strengthening secondary education management. \n \nC.   The Program Loan \n \n1.   Impact and Outcome \n \n30.  The program loan will support the implementation of policy reforms to (i) strengthen \nmanagement and governance of secondary education, (ii) improve the quality of secondary \neducation learning, and (iii) make access to secondary education more equitable. \n \n \n ", "    7     \n2.   Outputs \n \n31.  The policy framework of the SESDP is described in paras. 32-58. The essential policy \nactions for the three main sector challenges are in the policy matrix of the development policy \nletter (Appendix 7). The salient features of the policy matrix include (i) decentralization of \nsecondary  education  management,  (ii)  national  implementation  of  decentralized  EMIS,  (iii) \nnational implementation of SPBMS, (iv) functional specialization of the education cadre, (v) \nrevision of curricula for grades 9\u201310, (vi) reform of SSC examinations, (vii) introduction of SBA \nfor grades 6\u20139, and (viii) review of the secondary stipends\u2019 program for female students. \n \na.  Strengthened Management and Governance of Secondary Education  \n \n32.  Increased Decentralization. Nongovernment schools and madrasah make up more \nthan 95% of the secondary education system. DSHE has a management network throughout \nthe nine education zones and 64 districts of Bangladesh to manage secondary education. \nHowever, zone and district officers face many challenges in managing secondary education in \ntheir areas. As the authority for making decisions on planning and use of educational resources \nhas not been distributed formally, zone- and district-level managers have no authority, including \nover teacher and staff transfers, and disciplinary actions. With many district education officer \n(DEO) positions unfilled, staffing uncertainties hinder the efficiency and effectiveness of the \ndistrict education offices. The current relative weak status of the DEO positions vis-\u00e0-vis head \nteachers of government schools means that the incumbent DEOs lack system authority with the \nlatter. The status of the zone heads (deputy directors), to whom the DEOs report, similarly is \nseen as inadequate to ensure effective implementation at the zone level, and support at the \ndistrict  level.  The  upazila  level  has  no  secondary  education  offices,  although  upazila-level \npersonnel recently have been appointed to monitor stipends to female students.   \n \n33.  Given the scale and speed of the secondary education expansion, DSHE is planning to \nincreasingly decentralize, redistributing central DSHE responsibilities to the zone and district \nlevels. Zone and district offices will be upgraded, including the human resource functions within \nDSHE and in the field. Centralized processing of Monthly Payment Orders (MPO) in Dhaka \nmakes queries cumbersome, and provides rent-seeking opportunities for some personnel. For \ncloser  monitoring  of  MPO  processing  progress,  and  to  enable  the  EMIS  cell  to  focus  on \nprocessing education management data, the processing of MPOs eventually will be delegated \nto the education offices in each zone. Decentralization will require deployment of additional staff \nat the zone, district, and upazila levels, as well as structured job descriptions. \n \n34.  SMCs  are  responsible  for  monitoring  school  performance,  teacher  and  student \nattendance, appointment of teachers, and school budgets and finance. SMC members are \nelected  every  3  years.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  training  and  support  processes \nincreasingly  are  provided  to  SMC  members  to  help  them  execute  their  responsibilities \neffectively. \n \n35.  Monitoring and Quality Assurance System Established. With the widespread and \nrapid expansion of secondary education in Bangladesh, traditional mechanisms for secondary \nschool support and monitoring are inadequate to ensure the maintenance of quality education \nacross the whole system. The responsibilities for the supervision and inspection of schools need \nto be demarcated clearly. School inspections are the responsibility of zone- and district-level \nofficers, who visit the schools infrequently and do not have formal guidelines to follow. The \nDirectorate of Inspection and Audit (DIA) has overall responsibility for auditing nongovernment \nschools that receive government salary subvention and other assistance, and for ensuring their \ncompliance with the conditions of assistance. However, DIA\u2019s staff can inspect each school no \nmore than once every 9\u201310 years.  \n \n ", "8 \n36.  For greater transparency in linking government subventions to school performance, a \nsystem  for  monitoring  and  quality  assurance  (MQA)  in  DSHE,  which  will  involve  upazila \npersonnel, will be established for all general secondary schools and selected madrasah. The \nsystem will integrate the national implementation of SPBMS, supported by upazila academic \nsupervisors  (UAS)  and  well-defined  reporting  processes  through  the  EMIS.  SPBMS  was \napproved for national implementation in July 2005. Performance-based management also will \nbe introduced in alia madrasah.   \n \n37.  To support MQA, a unit will be established within DSHE through the extension of the \nfunctions of the Policy Support and Planning Unit within the planning and development wing. \nThe unit will have three major functions: (i) conducting monitoring, evaluation, and quality \nassurance; (ii) providing qualitative and quantitative data and information for policy formulation \nand  planning;  and  (iii)  conducting  in-house  research  to  assist  system  planning  and \ndevelopment. \n \n38.  The large number and primarily privately owned schools, difficult access, and continuing \ncommunications  problems  with  many  schools  are  challenges  that  can  delay  publication  of \nannual statistical data by more than 12 months, which reduces their utility. The Government has \npiloted in three districts a customized secondary EMIS, which is supported by an EMIS cell \nwithin DSHE and a decentralized structure at the zone and district levels. The Government also \nhas approved the national implementation of EMIS, which will promote collection of up-to-date \nand  accurate  information  for  planning  and  monitoring  secondary  education  schools  and \noutcomes. DSHE and Bangladesh Bureau of Educational Information and Statistics (BANBEIS) \nwill coordinate data collection and analysis. Further, the Government will ensure the effective \nuse of EMIS in planning, policy development, management, and monitoring.   \n \n39.  Functional Specialization Implemented Within the Education Agencies. The current \nsystem of frequent intra- and interdepartmental transfer hinders MOE and its agencies. In \nparticular,  this  constrains  professional  agencies\u2014the  National  Academy  of  Educational \nManagement,  NCTB,  BISE,  etc.\u2014where  the  retention  of  skilled  specialist  employees  is \nessential to the quality of services that these agencies provide. Almost all the professional \npositions in DSHE are filled through transfer and promotion from among the education cadre \nmembers. No skills distinction is made between equivalent positions within the cadre for the \npurposes of posting, promotion, and transfer.  \n \n40.  Although DSHE must carry out a variety of functions requiring different specializations, \nthe education cadre structure and its recruitment rules are less relevant with the emergence of \nspecialist professional subgroups. Modern competency-based job descriptions for the different \ncategories  of  positions  are  needed,  while  the  country  is  facing  an  acute  shortage  of \nappropriately qualified professional staff. The rapid growth of education in Bangladesh has \nincreased the need for specialists more quickly than the supply within the relatively small \ngovernment college system. \n \n41.  To retain professional skills and reduce the frequency of transfers among education \nspecialists,  the  Government  will  adopt  and  implement  functional  specialization  within  the \neducation cadre. Human resource management (HRM) functions within DSHE and all agencies \nwill be upgraded.  \n \n42.  Improved Operations and Management Systems. To support decentralization and \nfunctional specialization, as well as the establishment of an MQA system, MOE will align its \noperations,  management,  and  functions  in  BISE,  DIA,  DSHE,  NCTB,  and  other  agencies. \nReviews and studies of agencies\u2019 respective responsibilities, systems, and resources will inform \nthese activities.  \n \n ", "    9     \n43.  The rapid growth of the madrasah system has increased the operational responsibilities \nof BMEB, and changed the nature of many of its functions. The operations, facilities, and \nstaffing of BMEB need strengthening. A review of BMEB\u2019s role and responsibilities, structure, \noperations, staffing, and facilities is necessary. This review should cover the relationship of its \nfunctions with those of other MOE organizations and agencies, particularly NCTB. \n \nb.  Improved Quality of Secondary Education \n \n44.  Reviewed  and  Revised  Curricula.  Rote learning dominates the current secondary \neducation curricula to the exclusion of the development of learning and analytical skills essential \nfor life, work, or pursuing tertiary study. In a tracer study, HSC students\u2014graduates and job \nmarket  entrants\u2014consistently  expressed  the  opinion  that  the  curriculum  should  be  more \nmodern, realistic, and life- and work-oriented.10 Furthermore, since the curriculum focuses on \npreparing for the next stage of education, it is of little relevance for the majority of students who \ndo not have the ambition or possibility of pursuing higher education. \n \n45.  School curricula for grades 9\u201310 have been revised to address these gaps, and manuals \nfor each subject have been prepared and are ready for implementation. Curricula for grades 6\u20138 \nand 11\u201312 will be revised to make them learning and analytical skills-based, ensuring smooth \ninterface with the stated exit competencies of the current primary curriculum and the new \ngrades  9\u201310  curriculum.  Further,  this  will  establish  a  progression  of  attitudes  and  skills \ndevelopment for work, including self-employment. The revised curricula will include ICT-related \nsubjects and address ICT issues. The new grades 11\u201312 curricula will be aimed specifically at \npreparation for higher studies, and will establish a valid, reliable, and equitable selection system \nfor entry to tertiary education.  \n \n46.  Curricula  for  dakhil  (grades  6\u201310)  and  alim  (grades  11\u201312)  need  modernization, \nparticularly in Bangla, English, mathematics, and science subjects. Revisions similar to those \nintroduced in general secondary schools to improve secondary education quality and student \nassessment also should be introduced in madrasah. More comparability between the madrasah \nand general secondary education curricula, while retaining the unique characteristics of each, \nwill contribute to increased mobility of madrasah students between the two curricula, greater \naccess to higher education, and expanded training and job opportunities. The substantial rise in \nfemale enrollments in the madrasah recently necessitates adjustments of programs, teaching, \nand facilities. Alia madrasah qualifications have been granted equality with those of the general \nsecondary education institutions.  \n \n47.  NCTB\u2019s  functions  will  be  consolidated,  and  its  capacity  strengthened  for  quality \ncurriculum monitoring, research, implementation, and development of supporting teaching and \nlearning materials.  \n \n48.  Strengthened  Student  Assessment.  To  facilitate  student\u2019s  learning  in  class, \nassessments that directly inform classroom teaching (or formative assessments) are required. \nAn SBA system has been prepared, which is premised on the assumptions that (i) not all \ncurriculum  goals  can  be  assessed  by  written  testing;  and  (ii)  teachers  who  are  given \nresponsibility  in  the  terminal  assessment  of  their  students  will  get  more  involved  in  the \nassessment process, and will be more responsible for ensuring fair and valid assessments. SBA \napplies formative assessment methodologies by teachers to achieve timely corrective actions, \nand encourages the use of a wider range of learning activities aimed at more objectives within \nthe curricula. In July 2005, the Government approved SBA for national introduction in grades  \n                                                 \n10 Mian, M., R.B. Shanhjahan, and A.B. Hosen. 1998.

To enhance NCTB\u2019s capacity to ensure appropriate SBA components within revised \ncurricula, and to provide assistance to schools, the Secondary Assessment Unit will be merged \ninto the general curriculum development and implementation activities of NCTB across the key \nsubject groups. \n \n50.  Reformed National Examinations. The seven BISEs in the country conduct public \nexaminations after grades 9\u201310 (SSC) and grades 11\u201312 (HSC). Each BISE serves a specific \ngeographical area, and develops and conducts its own set of examinations. The overall quality \nof public examinations is poor, and the examinations and results are difficult to compare across \nthe BISEs. New and more relevant examinations are needed to measure student performance \nmore  accurately  over  the  entire  range  of  curriculum  objectives\u2014including  understanding, \nlearning, and analytical life skills\u2014using uniform standards.  \n \n51.  The Government has prepared model SSC examinations that use a smaller proportion of \nmultiple choice questions and introduce alternative question styles (structured questions) to \nreplace the current narrative or essay questions. Together, these will enable the examinations \nto test students more effectively across the full range of the curriculum learning objectives, and \nwill help overcome the overemphasis on recall of facts from textbooks. MOE issued notification \nin July 2005 for the introduction of revised SSC examinations beginning 2009.   \n \n52.  With the changes introduced in SSC and revisions in the curricula for grades 11\u201312, \nHSC  will  also  have  to  be  changed  in  line  with  the  type  of  questions  used  in  SSC.  The \nBangladesh Examinations Development Unit (BEDU) will provide professional assistance to the \nexamination boards system on the processes of examination setting, marking, and evaluation. A \ncentral entity (or national board) to oversee coordination and quality assurance of the secondary \nexamination  system  across  all examination  boards  will  be  considered.  Examination  reform \nprocesses and examination standards similar to those for general education will be introduced \nwithin the BMEB, and in parallel with the new madrasah curricula. \n \n53.  Strengthened Teacher Education. Trained teachers are in short supply: Less than half \nof secondary teachers are trained. Teaching standards, the foundation for a quality teacher \ntraining system, are also lacking. In addition, the teacher recruitment system is inadequate and \nlacks transparency. To address these issues, the Government is adopting a number of reforms \nand  implementing  development  activities  through  TQI  to  strengthen  teacher  education.  To \nensure minimum standards for teacher employment in the secondary sector, a national system \nfor secondary teacher registration is being established. Legislation has been enacted for the \nestablishment of the Non-Governmental Teacher\u2019s Registration and Certification Authority. To \nstrengthen pre-service and in-service teacher training, teacher resource centers will be set up, a \nnew teaching degree and new teaching certificate will be introduced, and teacher training staff \nwill be upgraded. Training will be provided for teachers, teacher-trainers, and administrators. \nTeacher training outreach stations will be established in selected areas. \n \n54.  Promotion of ICT Use. The widespread introduction of ICT education in public and \nprivate educational institutions and madrasah, as well as the promotion of ICT training and the \nuse of ICT in learning, is being promoted. A national system of cluster ICT laboratories will be \ninitiated.  \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "    11     \nc.  Enhanced Equity of Access \n \n55.  School  Facilities  Developed.  Most  school  facilities,  particularly  at  nongovernment \nschools  and  madrasah,  lack  quality,  adequate  maintenance,  and  the  specialist  equipment \ncommonly associated with secondary education elsewhere. This is largely a result of the rapid \nexpansion of generally small, rural nongovernment schools that were constructed piecemeal, \ndepending on the availability of resources within the community, and sometimes without proper \nplanning or design. Essential amenities, such as sanitation facilities for female teachers and \nfemale students, are lacking, especially in schools and madrasah where female enrollment has \nincreased dramatically. Across nongovernment schools, dedicated library areas and science \nlaboratories, among others, are absent. Teaching aids (e.g., maps, posters, and charts) are also \nlacking. At the same time, with improvements in primary education quality and access, more \nprimary education graduates are expected, which would lead to higher demand for secondary \neducation. In developing new schools to meet this increased demand effectively, duplications \nwith existing schools must be avoided. \n \n56.  To make access to secondary education more equitable, the Government will continue \nto  assist  in  the  construction  and  establishment  of  new  community-managed  schools  in \nunderserved communities that are willing to support and manage a new secondary school. To \nease congestion in schools where enrollment has increased significantly, particularly of girls, \nunder-resourced  schools  will  be  provided  with  additional  classrooms  and  girls  toilets.  A \nrationalized  school  facilities  improvement  strategy  will  guide  future  improvements  of \nnongovernment secondary school facilities.  \n \n57.  The lack of models of excellence to guide improvements has hindered the development \nof the madrasah system, particularly its role in modern general education. A centrally placed \nmadrasah in each district that is willing to adopt the revised curricula will be upgraded to include \nadditional  facilities  and  equipment,  enhanced  teaching  resources,  and  teachers,  where \nappropriate.  \n \n58.  Poverty-Targeted Stipends. Secondary enrollment rates are now higher for girls than \nfor  boys  at  every  grade  level,  except  in  Dhaka  and  other  metropolitan  cities.  Girls  also \noutnumber boys across grades 6\u201312 nationally. However, girls\u2019 dropout rates are still higher \nthan boys\u2019 at most class levels in grades 6\u201310, particularly between grades 8 and 9. Further, \ntheir SSC examination performance is not as good as boys\u2019, although the gap is narrowing. \nOverall, secondary enrollment rates are lower in the rural areas and for the poor. However, \nstudies indicate that students from non-poor households receive most of the stipend support. \nImproved  targeting  of  students  from  poor  families\u2014boys  and  girls\u2014is  required.  The \nGovernment will provide stipend and fee support to poor girls and boys who meet agreed \nconditions  of  attendance  and  performance.  The  Government  is  reviewing  the  criteria  for \nproviding  stipend  support  in  relation  to  income  equity  and  the  declining  share  of  boys  in \nenrollment.  \n \n  3.   Important Features \n \n59.  Single Tranche. SESIP was ADB\u2019s first phase of assistance to the subsector in support \nof SE-SDP. SESIP provided technical assistance and investment resources that initiated and \narticulated various policy reforms. The Government adopted these initiatives in 2005 and 2006, \nand  has  started  implementing  them.  With  competing  national  priorities,  the  Government \nrecognizes  that  the  immediate  implementation  of  these  adopted  reforms  requires  the \nmobilization of additional resources. Based on budget estimates, the Government will face a \nbudgetary shortfall within the first year of implementation and into the second year. ADB\u2019s \n2006\u20132010 country strategy includes SESDP as a follow-on assistance to SESIP to support the \nimplementation of secondary education development and reforms. \n ", "12 \n4.   Financing Plan \n \n60.  As proposed, ADB will support the Government\u2019s secondary education reform package \nby providing a single tranche program loan of $30 million in various currencies equivalent to \nSpecial Drawing Rights 20,292,000 from ADB\u2019s Asian Development Fund (ADF) resources. The \nloan will have an amortization period of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an \nannual interest charge of 1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. The loan proceeds \nwill be available for withdrawal upon compliance with the agreed conditions. The tranche will be \nreleased upon effectiveness of the loan; the conditions for the release of the tranche have been \nfulfilled.    \n \n61.  In determining the amount of the program loan, the following factors were considered: (i) \nthe relative importance of the education sector in terms of public spending, and the rising trend \nof public spending on secondary education following SE-SDP; (ii) the scope and strength of the \nreform package in the secondary education sector; and (iii) the short- and medium-term costs of \nthe reforms and the associated financing gap (Appendix 8). The loan amount covers part of the \nadjustment costs for the measures included in the policy matrix from Fiscal Year (FY) 2005-06 \nto FY2007-08 of the SE-SDP and its update.  \n \n5.   Implementation Arrangements \n \n62.  Program  Management.  MOE  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  responsible  for  the \nimplementation of policy measures. \n \n63.  Implementation Period. The program period is from 1 January 2006 to 31 December \n2008. The Government adopted the policy actions included in the policy matrix in 2005 and \n2006. The SESDP fits into the overall sector development plan, as reflected in the updated SE-\nSDP for 2006\u20132013. \n \n64.  Procurement and Disbursement. The program loan of $30 million will be released in a \nsingle tranche upon compliance with all tranche actions listed in the development policy letter. \nThe program loan will be disbursed using the simplified procedures approved by ADB\u2019s Board \non 16 April 1998.11 The proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of items \nproduced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding items included on a list of ineligible \nitems,  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources  (Appendix  9).  The \nBorrower will certify that the volume of eligible imports exceeds the amount of ADB\u2019s projected \ndisbursements under the program loan in a given period. ADB will have the right to audit the use \nof the loan proceeds, and to verify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification. \n \n65.  Financial  Management.  The Financial Management Reform Project, funded by the \nUK\u2019s Department of Foreign and International Development, is providing MOE with assistance \nto help improve its financial management. MOE\u2019s financial management unit is staffed and \nsupported by consultants with the assistance of this project. MOE is implementing a medium-\nterm Financial Management Improvement Plan, which it has agreed upon with the World Bank.  \n \n66.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to, and discussed with the \nGovernment.  Moreover,  all  relevant  ADB  guidelines,  including  the  Procurement  Guidelines \n(April 2006), Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, and Loan Regulations, were brought to the \nnotice of the Government.  \n \n67.  Counterpart Funds. The counterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the SESDP \nprogram loan will (i) supplement the Government\u2019s secondary education budget in support of \nthe SESDP reform package, and (ii) be part of the contribution of the Government to ADB-\n                                                 \n11 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila.  \n ", "    13     \nfunded  secondary  education  activities  within  the  scope  of  the  SE-SDP  2006\u20132013.  These \ninclude mostly capital investments, costs for the MQA of secondary education, and additional \noperation and maintenance costs of new offices and structures.  \n \n68.  Program Performance Monitoring System. DSHE will monitor the implementation of \nthe SESDP and its impact continuously, in line with the overall program framework and outcome \nindicators  agreed  upon  with  the Government.  Further, DSHE  will  submit  to  ADB  quarterly \nreports until the completion of SESDP. Data from the EMIS, household surveys, the population \ncensus,  and  program  implementation  documents  will  be  used  to  monitor  the  progress  of \nSESDP.  \n \nD.  The Project Loan \n \n1.   Impact and Outcome \n \n69.  The  project  loan  (the  Project)  will  focus  on  improving  the  efficiency  and  quality  of \nsecondary  education,  while  enhancing  access.  It  will  have  three  outputs:  (i)  strengthened \nmanagement of, and transparency in, secondary education management; (ii) higher quality \nsecondary education; and (iii) more equitable access to secondary education. \n \n2.   Outputs \n \na.   Strengthened  Management  of,  and  Transparency  in,  Secondary \nEducation Management  \n \n70.  This  component  will  support  (i)  increasing  decentralization  of  management \nresponsibilities, (ii) improving transparency in the financing of institutions, and (iii) strengthening \nHRM. These will contribute to improved accountability, transparency, and governance in the \nsecondary education system.  \n \n71.  Increased Decentralization of Management Responsibilities. This subcomponent will \nsupport the decentralization of secondary education management. DIA, DSHE, and DSHE field \noffice structure, and their operational and management systems, will be reviewed in relation to \ndecentralization  and  the  staff  reallocations  necessary  to  meet  revised  responsibilities.  The \nreviews will cover (i) DSHE management, and field and operational procedures; (ii) career \nstructure for DSHE field officers; (iii) functions and systems of BISE; (iv) NCTB operating \nsystems,  responsibilities,  and  delegations;  and  (v)  DIA\u2019s  charter,  functional  processes, \nresources,  professional  and  cost  effectiveness,  and  alternatives.  The  review  of  DSHE \noperations will inform the development of a staffing plan for the DSHE central office and its \ndecentralized offices. The DIA functions will be reviewed in relation to decentralization, the new \nMQA system, and government finance and audit processes. The review of functions of BISE will \ninform a possible rationalization of its functions, such as transferring recognition and registration \nof schools, which would allow greater focus on its essential examination functions. Further, the \nBISE review will examine the feasibility of establishing centrally located regional examination \nscript-marking centers to improve system performance. Personnel relocated to field offices will \nbe  provided  orientation  training.  To  support  the  decentralized  education  management,  two \nzone-level  education  offices  and  four  district  education  complexes  will  be  constructed  on \ngovernment-owned land. The Project will provide basic office equipment, furniture, vehicles, and \nan administrative budget.   \n \n72.  Improved Transparency in the Financing of Institutions. This subcomponent will \ninvest in developing and implementing an MQA system to monitor the quality and improve the \nperformance  of  secondary  schools,  including  nongovernment  schools  and  madrasah.  The \nproject loan will support the development and implementation of a school MQA system. This will \n ", "14 \nassist MOE and DSHE in policy planning, helping poorly performing schools, and decision \nmaking, including for the release of subventions. The Policy Support and Planning Unit of DSHE \nwill  be  given  the  additional  responsibility  of  school  MQA,  and  will  be  renamed  the  Policy \nSupport, School Monitoring and Quality Assurance (PMQA) Unit. The new MQA system will \nintegrate the use of SPBMS. PMQA, which will conduct reviews, assessments, and studies, will \npublish an annual report on school performance. PMQA will conduct a study on improving \npoorly  performing  schools,  documenting  the  lessons  and  identifying  important  factors \ncontributing to good performance. Third-party validation assessment studies will be performed \ntwice  during  project  implementation  to  review  the  quality  of  data,  and  to  monitor  the \nimplementation of the MQA system. Regional study tours will be provided to essential DSHE, \nImplementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division of the Ministry of Planning, MOE, Planning \nCommission, and Economic Relations Division officers to observe the implementation of an \nMQA system within a decentralized structure, including EMIS. \n \n73.  The subcomponent will support the national implementation of SPBMS in the general \nsecondary schools and its pilot implementation in at least 30 model madrasah. The PMQA unit, \nwith the assistance of a national consultant, will review and refine SPBMS guides. SPBMS \nguides  and  materials  will  be  adapted  to  the  madrasah  curricula,  and  then  printed  and \ndistributed.  Annual  SPBMS  training  will  be  provided  to  UAS,  head  teachers,  academic \ninspectors, and research officers. \n  \n74.  To support planning and MQA, investments will be made to expand EMIS nationally. \nEMIS  data,  which  will  be  used  to  monitor  schools,  will  be  analyzed  to  inform  secondary \neducation policy planning and Government decisions. Since EMIS data will be used in MQA and \npolicy support, the EMIS unit will be located in the planning and development wing of DSHE. \nUASs will collect EMIS data from schools and madrasah, while district officers will check the \nvalidity and enter the data. The data then will be submitted to the PMQA unit for further \ncollation, validity checks, cleaning, and processing. DSHE and BANBEIS will have access to the \ncomplete EMIS database. The processing of MPOs, currently performed by EMIS personnel, \nwill be delegated gradually to the zone education offices. \n \n75.  BANBEIS will publish an annual statistical report on the status of secondary education. \nEMIS data will be made available to other government agencies, researchers, development \npartners, and education stakeholders. The PMQA unit will conduct at least four policy research \nstudies  on  secondary  education  using  EMIS  data.  The  data  also  will  be  used  in  project \nmonitoring. A regional study tour to learn about the implementation and application of EMIS will \nbe  provided  to  essential  officers  of  the  EMIS  and  PMQA  units  of  DSHE,  planning  and \ndevelopment  wings  of  DSHE  and  MOE,  secondary  education  wings  of  DSHE  and  MOE, \nBANBEIS, and education wing of the Planning Commission. The Geographical Information \nSystem  software  in  DSHE  and  BANBEIS  will  be  updated,  and  data  communications  links \nbetween the two institutions will be installed.  \n \n76.  Strengthened  Human  Resource  Management.  To  support  decentralization  and \nfunctional specialization, this subcomponent will assist in improving the HRM function in DSHE \nand MOE agencies. DSHE, led by the administration wing, will update its HRM strategy. If \nneeded,  additional  staff  for  HRM  of  DSHE  will  be  recruited.  The  project  loan  will  provide \nconsulting services, equipment, furniture, running costs, and HRM-related materials. A national \nconsultant will support DSHE in developing a plan to establish this unit and its implementation \nprocedures, and defining the terms of references of the personnel. Job descriptions will be \nreviewed systematically. The staff monitoring and evaluation process will be refined, taking into \nconsideration functional specialization and decentralization. Related manuals, including ones on \nperformance management, will be developed, disseminated, and used for in-house training of \nstaff. \n ", "    15     \nb.   Higher Quality Secondary Education \n \n77.  This component will help to improve the quality of secondary education by (i) revising \ncurricula,  (ii)  supporting  the  reform  of  national  examinations,  (iii)  strengthening  student \nassessments, and (iv) strengthening SMCs. Improvements in the quality of madrasah education \nalso will be addressed.  \n \n78.  Revised Curricula. Curricula for grades 6\u20138 and 11\u201312 will be reviewed and revised to \nmake them skills-based, and to ensure a smooth interface with stated exit competencies of the \nprimary curriculum and the new curricula for grades 9\u201310. Related curriculum support guides \nand teacher training materials will be developed. Trainers and teachers will be trained in the \nnew curricula. An information dissemination strategy will be developed and implemented to \ninform parents, students, teachers, and other stakeholders of the benefits of the new curricula, \nand to alleviate concerns they might have. NCTB will lead the curriculum revisions. A curriculum \nreview  and  revision  committee,  comprising  subcommittees  dealing  separately  with  the  12 \nsubjects, will develop each curriculum. Non-NCTB subject specialists will establish external \nreview and revision committees for each subject or subject group. The development process will \ninclude consultations with stakeholders.  \n \n79.  NCTB\u2019s staffing pattern, and operating and management systems, will be reviewed in an \neffort to consolidate its functional and sustainable capacity to undertake quality curriculum \nmonitoring  and  research,  implementation,  and  development.  Twenty  NCTB  personnel  will \npursue master\u2019s degree studies locally, specializing in school curriculum development and/or \nimplementation, and related areas. The personnel will receive time off from the Government and \nfinancial  support  from  this  subcomponent.  NCTB  will  be  provided  with  office  equipment, \nsoftware, curriculum materials, and consultancy support for curriculum development. \n \n80.  As part of the development of new curricula for grades 6\u20138 and 11\u201312, the computer \nstudies or ICT subject will be updated. The ICT subject, and its teaching and learning materials, \nfor grades 9\u201310 also will be refined. Teachers will be trained to teach the refined ICT subject. E-\nlearning will be piloted in 20 schools to support the teaching of English, mathematics, and \nscience. The Project will provide computers, teacher training, learning materials, and national \nconsulting services on e-learning. \n \n81.  Madrasah curricula for grades 6\u201312 will be modernized, particularly in general education \nsubjects. The curriculum support guides and teacher training materials will be developed, and \nteacher training in the new curricula will be conducted. An information dissemination strategy \nwill  be  developed  and  implemented  to  inform  parents,  students,  teachers,  and  other \nstakeholders of the benefits of the new curricula, and to alleviate concerns they might have. \n \n82.  The needs of the BMEB in administering, managing, and monitoring modernization and \nquality improvements in madrasah education will be assessed. Recommendations for more \neffective organization and functioning will be developed. A sector study of dakhil and alim \nmadrasah education will be conducted. A capacity strengthening plan for BMEB and madrasah-\nrelated agencies will be developed. A regional study tour to learn about modernized madrasah \neducation  systems  will  be  provided  to  relevant  madrasah  education-related  officials  and \nstakeholders.  \n \n83.  Reformed National Examinations. The Government has approved the reform of SSC \nexaminations.  The  project  loan  will  support  the  training  of  master  trainers,  who  will  train \nexamination question-setters, markers, and moderators for the planned examination reforms.  \nAn  information  dissemination  strategy  on  the  revised  examinations  will  be  developed  and \nimplemented. Associated with the revision of curricula for grades 11\u201312 will be the development \nof model HSC examinations, which will be pilot tested. Examination development committees \n ", "16 \nwill  develop  the  HSC  model  examinations.  BEDU  will  spearhead  the  implementation  of \nexamination-related activities. One international and one national specialist in examinations \ndevelopment, including expertise in item and testing analyses, will be provided.  \n \n84.  Fifteen  BISE  personnel  will  pursue  master\u2019s  degree  studies  locally,  specializing  in \nassessment, examinations development and methodologies, and related areas. The personnel \nwill receive time off from the Government and financial support from this subcomponent. To \nanalyze the comparability of the various examination standards and examinations across the \ndifferent secondary education examination boards, the project loan will support studies of their \ncomparability.   \n \n85.  Strengthened Student Assessment. The application of improved learning assessment \nmethodologies  by  teachers  will  aid  student  learning.  This  subcomponent  will  support  the \nnational implementation of SBA in grades 6\u20139. Training and related training materials will be \nprovided to teachers. SBA also will be introduced in model madrasah. SBA materials will be \nadapted  to  madrasah  curricula,  and  madrasah  teachers  will  be  provided  with  the  related \ntraining. Information on SBA will be disseminated. NCTB will provide SBA-related assistance to \nschools.  \n \n86.  Strengthened School Management. SMC members will be trained to assist with school \ndevelopment, and to improve student and school performance.  \n \nc.    More Equitable Access to Secondary Education \n \n87.  Assistance  to  Underserved  Areas  and  Overcrowded  Schools.  By  building  and \nfurnishing 56 new community-managed schools in underserved areas, this subcomponent will \nmake access to secondary education more equitable. These schools will be selected according \nto criteria described in Appendix 10. Before approval of civil works, the following criteria will be \nconfirmed for each of the schools: (i) the areas in which they are going to be constructed are \nunderserved, (ii) the land is available for its construction, and (iii) the community will support the \nmanagement  of  the  school.  Toilet  facilities  for  females,  arsenic-free  tube  wells,  and  two \nadditional classrooms will be provided for 250 overcrowded schools enrolling girls, preferably in \nthe 53 upazilas where ADB will provide stipend assistance. School mapping will be undertaken, \nand  will  include  madrasah.  A  national  strategy  plan  for  rationalizing  and  improving \nnongovernment secondary school facilities will be developed for approval by MOE and ADB. \nStaff  of  the  Education  Engineering  Department  (EED)  will  receive  training  in  education \ninfrastructure, including monitoring and evaluation of civil works. \n \n88.  Model Madrasah Developed. One madrasah in each of the 30 districts (five in each \ndivision) will receive resources to become \u201cmodel madrasah\u201d offering the new curricula. Model \nmadrasah will receive two additional classrooms, laboratories, library, minor repairs, furniture, \ncomputers, teaching equipment, books, learning materials, and sports equipment.  \n \n89.  Poverty-Targeted Stipends. Poverty-targeted stipends will be provided to secondary \nstudents\u2014up  to  30%  of  a  school\u2019s  girls\u2019  enrolment  and  up  to  10%  of  a  school\u2019s  boys\u2019 \nenrolment\u2014from poor families in the 53 upazilas where ADB provided stipend assistance under \nSESIP. Selected students will be from families that meet established poverty criteria, and will \ncomply with agreed conditions of attendance and performance.    \n \n  3.   Important Features \n \n90.  In addition to supporting the improvement of education quality in general secondary \neducation  schools,  the  Project  will  support  improvements  in  the  quality  of  alia  madrasah \neducation. With official recognition that alia madrasah qualifications are equal to those of the \n ", "    17     \ngeneral  secondary  education,  quality  improvements  will  facilitate  the  mobility  of  madrasah \nstudents to general secondary education institutions at various levels. While still encouraging \ngirls to continue their secondary education, the Project will extend assistance to poor boys and \ntake into consideration students\u2019 economic status. \n \n4.   Project Investment Plan \n \n91.  The Project is estimated to cost $113.3 million, including taxes and duties of $6.4 million \n(see Table 1). Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 11 and Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n5.   Financing Plan \n \n92.  As proposed, ADB will provide a loan of $85.0 million in various currencies equivalent to \nSpecial Drawing Rights 57,493,000 from its ADF resources to finance 75% of the project costs \nof  $113.3  million.  ADB  will  finance  the  costs  of  civil  works,  vehicles,  equipment,  learning \nresources, training, consulting services, research and administration, and financial charges \nduring implementation. ADB also will finance a portion of project operation, maintenance, and \nstaff salaries, excluding taxes and duties. The term of the proposed loan will be 32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, with an annual interest charge of 1% during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% thereafter.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n93.  The Executing Agency for the Project will be MOE. The Implementing Agency will be \nDSHE, which will have overall responsibility to plan, organize, manage, supervise, coordinate, \nand monitor the Project, as well as monitor the progress achieved. The structure of the project \nimplementation unit (PIU) of SESIP will be retained and continue in the same role for SESDP. \nSESDP staff will be recruited directly, though preference could be given to those who worked on \nsimilar types of projects, such as SESIP. The PIU, which will be housed in the DSHE building, \nwill be responsible for day-to-day project implementation. Headed by a full-time project director \nselected in consultation with ADB, the PIU will be responsible for (i) detailed project planning \nand  scheduling;  (ii)  procurement  of  goods  and  works,  except  as  otherwise  agreed;  (iii) \nrecruitment and supervision of international and national consultants, other technical assistance, \nand training; (iv) project accounting, including arranging necessary audits; (v) disbursement of \nfunds, including timely submission of withdrawal applications; (vi) management of the imprest \naccount; and (vii) reporting to ADB on project progress. Given its support for SE-SDP 2006\u2013\n2013,  the  Project  will  maintain  close  coordination  with  the  ongoing  TQI  project  during \nimplementation. To coordinate the civil works program, district implementation coordination \ncommittees (DICC) will be established in each district where the Project finances subprojects. A \ndeputy commissioner will chair each DICC, and the DEO will act as member-secretary. Other \nDICC  members  will  include  representatives  from  the  district  EED,  concerned  SMCs,  head \nteachers, and nongovernment organizations (NGO). NCTB, BISE, and BMEB will implement \nvarious components of the Project, as described in paras. 69 to 89. \n \n94.  Project Steering Committee (PSC). A PSC will be formed and chaired by the MOE \nsecretary.  The  PSC  will  be  responsible  for  the  detailed  policy  formulation,  planning, \nimplementation, and evaluation of the reform agenda for the secondary education system under \nSESDP, including policy reforms within the program that help implement the SE-SDP 2006\u2013\n2013. The PSC will approve the criteria for the selection of (i) communities to receive new \nschools, and schools to receive additional classrooms; (ii) schools for piloting e-learning; (iii) \nmadrasah to be upgraded to become model madrasah; and (iv) personnel for foreign study \ntours, and foreign and local training. The PSC also will approve the selection process for \nmadrasah. The PSC, which will meet at least quarterly, will consist of representatives from \nBANBEIS;  BISE;  BMEB;  DIA;  DSHE;  Economic  Relations  Division;  EED;  Implementation \nMonitoring and Evaluation Division of the Ministry of Planning; Ministry of Chittagong Hill Tracts \nAffairs;  Ministry  of  Establishments;  MOE;  National  Academy  of  Educational  Management; \nNCTB; PIU of TQI; and the Planning Commission. Since the PSC is expected to address long-\nterm policy issues of secondary education, its membership will be flexible. Appropriate persons \nand specialists will be invited, as required. A project implementation committee, chaired by the \nDSHE director general, will be established to oversee the day-to-day implementation of the \nProject. The SESDP project director will act as the committee\u2019s member-secretary.    \n \n95.  Subproject Implementation. The Project will include about 56 unions.12 Each union will \nprepare a subproject proposal consisting of a package of school facilities to be constructed or \nexpanded, as well as the first year's implementation plan. All subprojects will be selected in \naccordance  with  the  criteria  listed  in  Appendix  10.  The  PIU  will  ensure  that  participatory \napproaches are used in subproject identification, planning, and implementation. Through these \napproaches, local communities, NGOs, women, and representatives of tribal people will be \ninvolved in subproject activities. The facilities will be selected, designed, and costed according \nto established criteria previously agreed with ADB. The DICCs will prepare the proposals in \n                                                 \n12 The union, represented by an elected union council, is the lowest level of official representative government. Its \nofficial responsibilities include representative involvement in education and health institutions. In practice, this \ngenerally means chairmanship or membership of SMCs or college governing bodies. \n ", "    19     \nconsultation with the community and NGOs. The proposals will be sent to DSHE and the PIU for \nreview and approval. Each year, DICCs will submit to PIU an updated implementation schedule, \nincluding work to be accomplished and a budget. The first 10 subproject proposals will be sent \nto ADB for its concurrence. Thereafter, ADB may require that randomly selected subproject \nproposals be submitted for its concurrence. ADB may refuse to finance any subproject that does \nnot meet the agreed criteria.  \n \n96.  The PIU will oversee all field-level operations. EED will tender the civil works to private \ncompanies, and also oversee physical works. To avoid unnecessary increases in construction \ncosts, EED will ensure that new schools are constructed on suitable land, and in accordance \nwith applicable Government and ADB environmental regulations or guidelines. The PIU will \nengage  an  independent  construction  supervision  firm  to  monitor  progress  and  quality  of \nconstruction. The supervision firm will deploy engineers at the district level, and make spot \nchecks and intensive visits at important stages of works, The firm also will verify the involvement \nof local communities in the planning and implementation of the subprojects. The DICCs will \nprepare quarterly reports and send them to PIU. The reports will include (i) a summary of \nimplementation  progress  compared  with  the  plan;  (ii)  a  financial  summary  showing  funds \nallocated, committed, and disbursed; (iii) a list of ongoing contracts and their physical progress; \nand (iv) a list of issues and proposals for their resolution. To facilitate the timely release of \nfunds, PIU will channel funds for small-scale facilities development from the imprest account \ndirectly to EED. For civil works in predominantly tribal unions, the DEOs will consult regularly \nwith the tribal council leaders of tribal communities and other appropriate local government \nbodies to determine civil works requirements.  \n \n97.  Period of Implementation. The project will be implemented over 6 years, from January \n2007 to December 2012 (Appendix 12).  \n \n98.  Procurement.  ADB-financed  goods,  services,  and  civil  works  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April 2006). The procurement plan for the \nproject is in Appendix 13. Each works contract estimated to cost more than the equivalent of $2 \nmillion will be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding, and works contracts \nestimated to cost the equivalent of $2 million or less will be awarded on the basis of national \ncompetitive  bidding  (NCB)  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Each  contract  for  goods,  and \nequipment and/or materials greater than $1 million will be awarded on the basis of international \ncompetitive bidding procedures, and those for $1 million or less will follow NCB procedures \nacceptable to ADB. NCB procedures applicable to the Project are specified in the Government\u2019s \nPublic Procurement Regulations 2003. Before commencement of NCB procurement, ADB and \nthe Government will review Government\u2019s procurement procedures to ensure consistency with \nADB requirements. Any necessary modifications or clarifications to Government\u2019s procedures \nwill be documented in the procurement plan. NCB packages valued at more than $100,000 \neach will be subject to prior review by ADB. The PIU will ensure that all procurement complies \nwith the applicable procedures. Specifically, the PIU will (i) determine bid packages and propose \nprocurement  methods,  as  approved  by  ADB;  (ii)  prepare  detailed  material  lists  and \nspecifications;  and  (iii)  evaluate  bids  and  award  contracts  in  collaboration  with  associate \nimplementing agencies. \n \n99.  Consulting Services. The selection and engagement of consultants to be financed \nunder the Project will be in accordance with Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006). \nA team of consultants (Appendix 13 and Supplementary Appendix B) will provide services in a \nrange of specializations, with estimated international inputs of about 92 person-months and \nnational inputs of about 212 person-months. The team will be engaged through a firm using the \nquality- and cost-based selection method, and a full technical proposal will be used for the \nrecruitment. An additional 10 person-months will be provided through individual recruitment.  \n ", "20 \n100.  Anticorruption Policy. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to, and discussed \nwith, the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations \nand the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, contracts financed by ADB under the \nProject will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and \naccounts of MOE and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they \nrelate to the Project.  \n \n101.  Good governance and anticorruption measures of the Project are in Appendix 14. During \nimplementation, the Project will monitor project activities frequently and regularly, including \nschool selection and tendering, and poverty-targeted stipends. The PIU will have a project Web \nsite that will provide procurement notices and procurement status. Third-party assessment \nvalidation studies also will be undertaken for SPBMS and EMIS. Staff will be trained in good \ngovernance.  \n \n102.  Advance  Contracting.  As  the  Project  needs  to  operate  immediately  after  loan \neffectiveness, MOE has requested advance action for procurement of civil works, goods, and \nmaterials  and/or  equipment  to  expedite  project  implementation,  particularly  by  short-listing \nconsulting firms. Advance action will apply only until the evaluation of bids; contracts will be \nawarded and agreements signed only after loan effectiveness. ADB\u2019s concurrence on advance \nactions does not commit ADB to finance the Project. MOE will negotiate the contract with the \nhighest ranked firm. \n \n103.  Staff Development and Training. International and local training will be provided under \nthe Project. Regular local training will support SPBMS, SBA, curriculum dissemination, and \nexamination  reform.  Selection  of  candidates  will  follow  the  Government\u2019s  policy  and \nimplementing guidelines for international and local training. ADB\u2019s approval will be required \nbefore  international  training  is  awarded.  ADB  will  be  provided  with  a  list  of  (i)  nominated \ncandidates, (ii) their qualifications, (iii) justification and relevance of training, and (iv) detailed \ncost of proposed training. Training recipients will have to sign a bonding arrangement that \nrequires  them  to  remain  in  their  institutions  for  a  minimum  period,  in  accordance  with \nGovernment procedures.  \n \n104.  Disbursement  Arrangements. MOE will be responsible for preparing disbursement \nprojections, and for requesting budgetary allocations for counterpart funds. To ensure the timely \nrelease of loan funds, an imprest account will be established in the Bangladesh Bank. The initial \namount will be equivalent to no more than 6 months of projected disbursements, or 10% of the \nloan  amount,  whichever  is  less.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  and \nliquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, and detailed arrangements \nagreed to by the Government and ADB. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure (SOE) procedures may \nbe used to reimburse eligible expenditures, as well as to liquidate advances made into the \nimprest account in accordance with ADB\u2019s loan disbursement guidelines. Any payment to be \nreimbursed or liquidated under the SOE procedures will not exceed the equivalent of $50,000. \nMOE will coordinate the timely release of funds. Auditors acceptable to ADB will audit the use of \nthe imprest account and SOE procedures. A separate audit opinion should be included in the \nannual audit report. \n \n105.  Accounting and Auditing. The Government, acting through MOE, will maintain records \nand accounts adequate to identify goods and services financed from the loan proceeds. MOE \nwill maintain separate records and accounts for the Project, and ensure that accounts and \nfinancial statements are audited annually by independent external auditors acceptable to ADB. \n ", "    21     \nIn addition to the yearly financial audit, independent contractors acceptable to ADB will conduct \nassessment studies to review the effectiveness of the outputs and activities. The auditor\u2019s report \nand copies of the certified accounts and related financial statements, including the auditor\u2019s \nopinion on the use of loan proceeds, compliance with loan covenants, and use of the imprest \naccount under ADB\u2019s SOE procedures, will be submitted to ADB in English not later than 6 \nmonths after the end of the Government\u2019s fiscal year. \n \n106.  Reporting. The PIU will prepare quarterly reports on the status and progress of project \nimplementation, and will submit them to ADB and MOE within 20 days after each quarter.  \nThe reports, which will be in a format acceptable to ADB, must indicate (i) progress made \nagainst established targets, (ii) status of performance indicators, (iii) problems encountered and \nactions taken to address them, (iv) compliance with loan covenants, and (v) proposed program \nof activities for the following quarter. Within 3 months after physical completion of the Project, \nthe Government will prepare and submit to ADB a project completion report describing project \nimplementation, accomplishments, benefits, impact, costs, and compliance with loan covenants. \n \n107.  Project Performance Monitoring System. To ensure efficient project implementation, \nthe Government will prepare and provide ADB with the following fiscal year\u2019s operational plan \nfor the Project at least 30 days before the start of the next fiscal year. The operational plan will \ninclude mainly (i) project activities, with cost estimates proposed for each component and/or \nsubcomponent  with  performance  targets;  (ii)  a  plan  for  complying  with  outstanding  loan \ncovenants; (iii) a breakdown of financial requirements, including loan proceeds withdrawal and \ncounterpart funds from the Government; and (iv) details of how project activities are to be \nintegrated into other ongoing programs. \n \n108.  DSHE and the PIU will establish a comprehensive project performance monitoring and \nevaluation  (M&E)  system  acceptable  to  ADB.  Further,  DSHE,  through  the  PIU,  will  be \nresponsible for project M&E. Within the first 6 months of implementation, a baseline indicator \nstudy will be conducted to refine and expand verifiable indicators of project inputs, outputs, and \nimpact, including enrollment and enrollment projections. Where appropriate, data, and indicators \ncollected  by  SESIP  will  be  used.  The  planning  and  development  wing  of  DSHE  will  be \nresponsible  for  output  and  impact  M&E  through  its  EMIS  and  SPBMS.  EMIS  will  collect \ninformation regularly, and monitor the implementation of project activities. Project M&E data, \nincluding from EMIS, will be reported and analyzed in quarterly and annual reports submitted to \nADB. The Project will strengthen DSHE capacity for policy analysis. The PMQA unit of DSHE \nwill  conduct  studies  on  issues  and  policies  relating  to  school  performance  and  quality  of \neducation. Evaluation studies on MQA, SBA, and stipends also will be undertaken. \n \n109.  Project Review. The Government and ADB will review the Project\u2019s progress jointly at \nleast twice a year. Besides these regular reviews, the Government and ADB will undertake a \njoint midterm review during the Project\u2019s third year. Among other things, they will (i) review the \nproject scope, design, implementation arrangements, institutional development, and capacity-\nbuilding processes; (ii) review changes in Government policies and institutional framework since \nappraisal, and evaluate their impact on project implementation and sustainability; (iii) assess \nproject implementation against appropriate projections and performance indicators; (iv) review \ncompliance with loan covenants; (v) identify critical issues, problems, and constraints; and (vi) \nrecommend changes in project design or implementation, as needed. Specific attention will be \ngiven to a review of the stipend program, the implementation of the MQA system, SBA, and \ncurriculum development. The PIU will submit to ADB a comprehensive report on each of these \nissues 1 month at most before the review.  \n \n \n \n ", "22 \nIV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.   Project Benefits and Impacts  \n \n110.  Sectoral Benefits. SESDP will contribute to improving the management and efficiency \nof the secondary education sector. The decentralization of responsibilities, and creation of new \nposts  at  the  zone  and  district  levels,  will  enhance  understanding  of  the  local  situation, \ncontributing to faster decision making. Moreover, the proximity to stakeholders will facilitate the \nresolution of secondary education management issues. DSHE\u2019s management capacity will be \nstrengthened. Putting into place an MQA system will help the Government better assist poorly \nperforming schools and halt salary subventions, where applicable. This also will increase the \ntransparency of decisions on payments of salary subventions, which, in turn, should facilitate \nquality improvements. Revision of curricula through effective preparation in reading, writing, \nnumerical skills, and work attitudes, among others, as well as analytical thinking, will make them \nmore relevant to the labor market.     \n \n111.  Social. SESDP aims to improve quality and efficiency of secondary education. Higher \nquality secondary education will improve learning, as well as make it more relevant, and help \nreinforce  the  idea  among  parents  that  attending  school  is  a  productive  activity  and  an \ninvestment in children\u2019s futures. The direct poverty impacts of the Program are expected to be \npositive  (Supplementary  Appendix  C).  Reforms  that  strengthen  the  management  and \ngovernance of secondary education will benefit secondary schools where poor and nonpoor \nstudents are enrolled. However, higher quality secondary education will benefit particularly poor \nstudents, who cannot afford high-priced private schools and private tutorial sessions. Curricula  \nthat are based on learning-skills and develop attitudes and skills for work will increase the \nrelevance of education to the labor market. Modernization of dakhil and alim madrasah curricula \nwill  benefit  madrasah  students,  many  of  whom  are  from  poor  households.  Modernized \nmadrasah  education  will  increase  the  competitive  chances  of  children  who  graduate  from \nmadrasah and seek higher education and employment, in addition to learning life skills for \nparticipation in the globalized economic and social environment. The civil works components of \nthe SESDP project loan will improve the learning environment in crowded schools that enroll \ngirls. The provision of toilets for females and tube wells will improve the learning conditions of \nschoolchildren and teachers, particularly females. Construction of new secondary schools in \nunderserved  areas  will  reduce  opportunity  costs  of  attending  secondary  school,  making \nsecondary school attendance by the poor more feasible. Provision of poverty-targeted stipends, \nwhich reduce the cost of school further, should encourage students from poor households to \ncontinue attending secondary school.  \n \n112.  Economic. Annually, the 56 new schools that are planned will benefit an additional \n16,800 students, while the 560 additional classrooms in schools and madrasah will benefit more \nthan  22,000  secondary  school  students.  By  2013,  civil  works,  stipend  assistance,  and \nimprovements in education quality are expected to increase enrollment rates by 15% and raise \nSSC pass rates by 5%. Further, with the expected increase in enrollments and greater pressure \non resources, dropout rates at a minimum are envisaged to be retained at the 2004 level. Closer \nmonitoring  of  school  performance  will  increase  the  cost  efficiency  of  the  Government\u2019s \nexpenditures in the secondary education subsector.   \n \nB.  Project Risks and Assumptions \n \n113.  The design of the Program draws on the lessons learned from previous assistance. \nSESDP assumes high level of commitment from the Government to implement the adopted \nreforms. Any risk related to backtracking of reforms is mitigated by the reforms\u2019 links to the \nwider long-term frameworks in the sector, including (i) reforms recommended in the PRS, (ii) \n ", "    23     \nconsultation with stakeholders during development and implementation, and (iii) activities to \ninform the public of these reforms and allay concerns. In addition, the issues being addressed \nby SESDP are at the heart of improving the quality of, and increasing access to, secondary \neducation, which any government will need to address.  \n \n114.  The implementation of reforms requires coordination by MOE and DSHE with education \nagencies  and  other  stakeholders.  Stakeholders  will  be  represented  in  the  project \nimplementation arrangements to facilitate the coordination of activities across agencies. Project \nactivities  will  support  stronger  coordination  and  less  overlap  of  responsibilities  across  the \neducation agencies. The capacity of relevant stakeholders also will be strengthened. Changes \nto curricula, and student assessments and examinations, will be disseminated widely to the \npublic in a timely and careful manner to build confidence. In addition, stakeholders will be \nconsulted on new curricula, assessments, and examinations. \n \n115.  The sustainability of reforms (e.g., SPBMS, SBA, and others) beyond the reform period \nassumes  that  staff  will  be  available  to  continue  their  implementation.  A  financial  analysis \nsuggests that, if all other things are constant, sufficient resources will be available to secondary \neducation to continue the reforms. Improved monitoring of school performance in relation to the \ncontinuation of salary subventions will increase efficiencies and contribute to financial savings in \nthe sector. Reforms relating to decentralization and functional specialization will institutionalize \nnew positions, for which Project staff could apply.  \n \n116.  Safeguard  Measures.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in \nAppendix 15, and gender action plan is in Appendix 16. As neither the proposed program loan \nnor the project loan is expected to have any significant environmental impacts, SESDP has \nbeen  classified  as  environmental  category  C.  An  environmental  assessment  of  the  policy \ninterventions (Supplementary Appendix D) has shown that most of the proposed policy actions \nwill not impact the environment, while the policy action aiming to make access to education \nmore  equitable  might  have  some  very  minor  impacts.  To  support  the  sector-like  project \ninvestment  component  of  SESDP,  an  environmental  assessment  review  and  procedures \nframework has been prepared (Supplementary Appendix E). Insignificant environmental impacts \nthat might arise during implementation of the project loan include dust and noise pollution from \nsmall building construction activities, and contaminated water extraction from school wells\u2014\nboth  of  which  can  be  mitigated  easily.  SESDP  is  expected  to  contribute  positively  to  the \nenvironment by providing school latrines, and improving hygiene practices among children and \nyouth. \n \n117.  As the Project will build schools in underserved areas, some of its residents might be \nfrom tribal groups. The reforms under the program loan are not expected to impact tribal people \nnegatively. Instead, the national implementation of the reforms will improve the quality and \nrelevance of secondary education for all groups. However, in case the Project has a negative \nimpact on a tribal group or a positive impact does not accrue to them in the beneficiary area, \nsafeguard measures will be included. These safeguards will be contained in a tribal people\u2019s \ndevelopment  plan  under  the  tribal  people\u2019s  development  framework  (Appendix  17, \nSupplementary Appendix F), or as a specific action in any resettlement plan that might be \nnecessary (para. 121 [xi] below).  \n \n118.  The  Project  is  not  expected  to  require  any  involuntary  resettlement.  Additional \nclassrooms, laboratories, and school facilities for overcrowded schools and model madrasah will \nbe accommodated within the premises of existing schools and madrasah. Hence, they will not \ninvolve land acquisition and resettlement. The construction of new schools will be mostly on \nGovernment land. Impacts are to be minimized further through careful subproject siting and \nalignment during subproject selection, detailed design, and subproject implementation. The \n ", "24 \nsubproject selection criteria for new schools rule out subprojects with significant involuntary \nresettlement impacts.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.   Specific Assurances \n \n119.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \nassurances, which will be incorporated into the legal documents. \n \n120.  For the program loan: \n \n(i)  The Government will implement SE-SDP 2006\u20132013 in a timely manner, and in \nconsultation with ADB regarding elements related to the Program.  \n(ii)  The Government will ensure that the growth rate of the secondary education \nbudget for the FY2006-07 is greater than the growth rate of the gross domestic \nproduct.  \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that the policies adopted and actions taken, as \ndescribed in the development policy letter and the policy matrix (Appendix 7), \ncontinue in effect for the duration and beyond the program period.  \n(iv)  Within  1  year  of  the  program  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  have \ncompleted the establishment of a program performance monitoring system for \nthe Program.  \n \n121.

Purpose \n \n1.  The  major  development  purpose  of  the  Secondary  Education  Sector  Improvement \nProject (SESIP)1 was to initiate a series of policy reforms in support of the Secondary Education \nSector Development Plan 2000\u20132010, and to varying degrees start implementation based on \nthose reforms. The reforms have involved significant policy changes in eight major areas of \nsecondary  education,  which  impact  on  the  administration,  management,  and  school \nperformance  of  the  16,000-plus  secondary  schools,  and  specialist  agencies.  The  Project \nprovided assistance to (i) strengthen management systems and capacity, (ii) improve quality, \nand (iii) make access to secondary education more equitable. The cost of the Project was \nestimated at $86 million. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided a loan of $60 million \nfrom the Asian Development Fund resources, which was declared effective in December 1999. \nThe project completion date is December 2006. \n \nB.   Summary of Components and Outputs \n \n1.  Management Systems and Capacity  \n \n2.  Activities towards improved policy support and strategic planning have: (i) established a \npolicy  support  and  strategic  planning  unit  within  the  Directorate  of  Secondary  and  Higher \nEducation (DSHE); (ii) supported research and policy studies; (iii) established planning and \nmonitoring units in zone offices; and (iv) recommended  functional specialization within the \neducation cadres. \n \n3.  Project inputs to decentralize performance-based management have: (i) developed a \nmodel for decentralized management for secondary education for more effective schools; (ii) \nconstructed 52 district offices, five zone offices, and two education complexes; (iii) rehabilitated \nnine  Secondary  Education  Science  Development  Centers;  (iv)  developed  and  installed \neducation management information system (EMIS) at national headquarters, and in some zones \nand districts; (v) developed, piloted, and evaluated a performance-based management system \nfor secondary education; (vi) constructed new building and recruited additional staff for the \nNational Academy of Educational Management; (vii) recruited additional staff for the Directorate \nof Inspection and Audit (DIA); (viii) trained school management committee members; and (ix) \nprovided the School Improvement Fund. \n \n2.   Quality Support Systems \n \n4.  To strengthen the capacity for curriculum development, the Project: (i) increased the \ncapacity of National  Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB) for developing curriculum, and \nprototype  teaching  and  learning  materials  for  secondary  education;  (ii)  established  a  new \nmaterials development unit in NCTB; (iii) established, trained, and supported eight curriculum \ndevelopment teams; (iv) revised curriculum for grades 9\u201310; and (v) developed curriculum \nguides and manuals. \n \n5.  To  improve  secondary  education  textbooks,  the  Project  developed  detailed \nimplementation plan for the phased privatization of secondary textbooks to ensure a choice of \nhigher quality secondary textbooks at competitive prices. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1999.

Manila. \n ", "Appendix 1  27\n6.  Project  inputs  to  improve  student  assessment  and  public  examinations  have:  (i) \ndeveloped and piloted school-based assessment (SBA) to help teachers and students improve \ntheir academic performance; (ii) developed SBA teachers\u2019 guides and materials; (iii) established \nthe student assessment unit (SAU) in NCTB; (iv) developed with the Board of Intermediate and \nSecondary  Education  (BISE)  processes  for  improving  public  Secondary  School  Certificate \n(SSC) examinations to measure student performance more accurately over the whole range of \ncurriculum objectives; (v) established Bangladesh examination development unit (BEDU) in \nBISE; and (vi) developed master trainer materials and training for examination reform. \n \n7.  Activities towards reformed secondary teacher education have: (i) developed policy for \npre-service and in-service teacher education, including private teacher training colleges and \nteacher qualifications for grades 9\u201312; and (ii) developed new teacher education curriculum to \ninclude increased participatory training and improved teaching practice. \n \n3.   Equitable Access \n \n8.  The Project (i) constructed 59 new schools,  (ii) constructed or repaired 111 classrooms, \n(iii) reconstructed 20 flood-damaged schools, (iv) repaired 96 flood-damaged schools, and (v) \nconstructed toilets and tube wells in 868 schools. Support for female stipend was provided in 53 \nupazilas (subdistricts), where community awareness programs were also held, and monitoring \nand tracer study undertaken. \n \nC.   Descriptions of Selected Outputs \n \n9.  SBA.  SBA  models  were  prepared  through  an  extensive  series  of  school-based \nworkshops, and trial implementation for grades 9\u201310 in 49 lead schools nominated by the \nexamination boards. Activities in each lead school were guided by a lead teacher, who had \nreceived international training under the Project. SBA for grades 6\u20138 was developed through \nNCTB and piloted in 40 schools nationally. The outcome has been an agreement on a series of \nspecific  procedures  for  each  school  subject  to  enable  systematic  continuing  classroom \nassessment of all learning objectives for all students. SAU was set up in NCTB with staff \nrecruited  under  SESIP,  and  trained  abroad  and  locally  through  national  and  international \nconsultant  inputs.  The  functions  of  the  SAU  officers  are  to  (i)  provide  leadership  for  the \nincorporation of SBA in NCTB curricula, subject manuals, and teachers\u2019 guides; (ii) assist \nschools and teachers with the implementation of SBA; and (iii) monitor the effectiveness of SBA \nin the schools over the long term.  \n \n10.  SSC Examination Reform. The agreed reforms for SSC examinations reduces the \nproportion of multiple choice questions, and introduces alternative question styles (structured \nquestions)  to  replace  the  narrative  or  essay  questions.  Together,  these  will  enable  the \nexaminations to test students more effectively across the full range of the curriculum learning \nobjectives, and will help overcome the overemphasis on recall of facts from textbooks. The draft \nrecommendations  for  new  examination  question  models  were  tested  in  pilot  examinations \nconducted  in  each  subject  in  the  49  pilot  schools.  The  aim  was  to  test  their  clarity  and \nunderstandability,  difficulty  level,  and  validity  in  distinguishing  between  student  levels  of \nresponse.  Approximately  10,000  students  participated  in  the  pilot  examinations.  New \nprocedures to ensure more valid question-setting, and processes for more equitable and reliable \nmarking  of  student  answers,  also  have  been  adopted  within  the  approved  reforms. \nRecommendation  for  inter-board  and  inter-subject  moderation  to  ensure  common  national \nstandards will be reviewed after additional trials. The BEDU has been established at Dhaka \nExamination Board with newly recruited staff trained abroad and locally to assist with the \nimplementation of the examination reforms. Training of master trainers nominated from each \nboard\u2014in preparation for the large-scale training of all examination personnel from all boards\u2014\nwas trialed in late 2005.   \n ", "28  Appendix 1 \n11.  Curriculum  Development  and  NCTB.  The  SESIP  initiatives  focused  mainly  on \nstrengthening the capacity of NCTB to undertake curriculum review and redevelopment. To this \nend, 20 new curriculum development and four materials development staff were appointed to \nNCTB through SESIP. International and national consultants trained the new staff abroad and \non-the-job. The review of current international secondary curriculum, particularly in regional \ncountries, was carried out through a Web search. Classroom implementation of the current \ngrades 9\u201310 curriculum was reviewed in a sample of schools. Local stakeholder and community \nopinions, as well as employer needs, were sampled. Initial curriculum review and development \nworkshops  were  held  in  all  divisional  centers  with  teachers,  educators,  and  community \nstakeholders.  A  draft  curriculum  framework  was  developed  and  submitted  to  the  National \nCurriculum Coordination Committee. Detailed development of each subject curricula within the \nagreed framework was organized through expert subject curriculum development committees, \nwith  NCTB  specialists,  appointed  school  teachers,  curriculum  consultants,  and  appointed \nexternal  subject  experts.  Each  subject  curriculum  document  included  (i)  subject-specific \nobjectives; (ii) specification of contents based on cognitive, problem solving, personal, and \nsocial learning outcomes; (iii) specification of contact hours by units of work; (iv) specified \nstudent-centered  teaching  processes;  (v)  theoretical  and  practical  teaching  and  learning \nactivities; (vi) specification of assessment processes, including SBA; and (vii) recommendations \nfor  teaching  resources  for  key  topics.  Stakeholder  workshops  for  review  of  the  subject \ncurriculum by teachers and subject experts were held in each region nationally, establishing the \nbasis for modification of the draft documents. Revised documents were presented to a national \nstakeholder  workshop  under  the  minister  of  education,  and  then  referred  to  the  National \nCurriculum Coordination Committee for approval. Subsequent community awareness programs \nwere organized on a regional level for local stakeholders and community.  \n \n12.  A subject manual was developed for 13 of 14 major subjects: agricultural education, \nBangla,  Buddhist  religious  studies,  business  studies,  Christian  religious  studies,  general \nscience,  higher  mathematics,  Hindu  religious  studies,  home  economics,  information  and \ncommunications technology, Islamic religious studies, mathematics, and social science. Each \nmanual contains (i) the curriculum for the subject; (ii) a sample of exemplar teaching-learning \nactivities based on the new curriculum; and (iii) instructions to teachers on the assessment of \nstudents' performance on the skills within the new curriculum in the school, including a brief \nsummary  of  the  essential  features  of  subject-specific  SBA  for  grades  9\u201310.  \nA teacher's guide to the new style examination for each of the 13 subjects also has been \nproduced, each containing (i) a sample structured questions examination paper (or papers in \ncase of Bangla, general science, and social science) for the subject, with accompanying model \nanswers and  marking schemes;  (ii)  sample multiple choice questions examination papers for \nthe subject, with accompanying specification grid showing the intellectual skills assessed and \nthe key (correct response) for each question; and (iii) guidelines on setting school terminal and \nyearly examinations, in line with the new style examinations. \n \n13.  School Performance-Based Management System (SPMBS). The development of the \nSPBMS started in pilot secondary schools in three pilot districts of one zone. It was trialed in \nnominated upazilas of the pilot districts, and independently evaluated. The SPBMS is based on \na  set  of  performance  indicators  and  measurable  sub-indicators:  (i)  leadership  of  the  head \nteacher; (ii) school managing committees; (iii) professionalism and motivation of teachers; (iv) \nstudent  attendance,  dropout,  and  completion;  (v)  student  performance;  (vi)  co-curricular \nprograms; and (vii) guardian-teacher relationship. School communities, including head teachers, \nteachers,  school  managing  committees,  and  guardians,  are  assisted  in  developing  and \nimplementing a plan for improvement against agreed school targets and national norms. The \nnewly appointed academic supervisors in each upazila, and assistant inspectors and research \nofficers at district and zone offices, directly support the implementation by the schools. They will \n ", "Appendix 1  29\nprovide continuing assistance to a group of nominated schools, particularly those identified as \n\u201clow performing\u201d, to implement SPBMS to strengthen the school\u2019s management and academic \nsupervision.  The  upazila  academic  supervisors  and  assistant  inspectors  undertake  school \nplacements and intensive field training to prepare them for their roles. \n \nD.   Lessons  \n \n14.  The  implementation  of  SESIP  has  yielded  lessons  that  have  been  taken  into \nconsideration in the design of the Secondary Education Sector Development Program (SESDP).  \n \n15.  ADB\u2019s Project Administration Manual, SESIP2 noted: \u201cThe Project will be the first stage \nin the long-term subsector framework. One of the main challenges will be to predict the pace at \nwhich  reforms  will  take  place.\u201d  This  proved  correct  in  practice.  In  particular,  the  pace  of \ndevelopment and the processes of formal acceptance were neither uniform across the different \nreforms nor predictable. Pilot tests and evaluation of their results need to be integral parts of \nany  reform  project,  and  explicitly  stated  and  funded  as  such.  Extensive,  proactive  mass \ndissemination to the community is also necessary. Greater coordination by the Ministry of \nEducation in important reform areas is necessary to minimize delays and ensure coordination of \nimplementation of project- and policy-related activities across initiatives.  \n \n16.  To retain the capacity developed through SESIP resources, staff recruited and trained \nshould be transferred to the Government\u2019s recurrent budget. On-the-job training programs led \nby the consultant(s), with a program and regularly scheduled sessions, have been relatively \nsuccessful  in  terms  of  attendance,  participation,  and  outcomes.  The  inclusion  of  some \nsecondary teachers and a head teacher among the recruited SESIP specialists has been very \nsuccessful, given that NCTB\u2019s work focuses on secondary education. Drawing on their firsthand \nexperience, the specialists with secondary teaching backgrounds made strong contributions to \nall activities. The proportion of staff with secondary school teaching backgrounds, as distinct \nfrom  college  teaching  backgrounds,  should  be  increased  substantially  in  future  activities. \nSimilarly,  more  attention  should  be  given  to  the  spread  of  discipline  backgrounds  in  the \nappointment  of  project  specialists,  allowing  all  secondary  subject  groups  to  be  covered \nadequately.  \n \n17.  Sustained school implementation of SPBMS as a vehicle for school improvement will \nrequire a fully functioning monitoring system linked to specific actions to support or penalize \nschools through the salary subvention system. For such a monitoring system, the capacity of \nDSHE, as well as the zone and district education offices, will have to be upgraded. A fully \nfunctioning  EMIS  will  be  needed  to  provide  support.  An  essential  precondition  for  the \nstrengthening of the functioning of DIA is a review of its purposes, functions, organization, \nlocation, and processes.  \n  \n18.  Extensive, timely, and carefully developed and presented public dissemination of any \nchanges to student assessment and examinations is needed. Confidence building measures are \nneeded before SBA is introduced. This starts with gaining an appreciation that SBA is more than \nadding co-curricular activities to the school report, and that SBA increases assessment validity, \nthereby improving teaching by guiding teachers to teach more than factual content. \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2000.

Manila (page 1).  \n ", "30        Appendix 2 \nSECOND PRIMARY EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \nIMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS \n \n1.  Program Description. The Second Primary Education Development Program (PEDP-II)1 is \na comprehensive sector-wide approach program (SWAp) designed to reduce poverty through \nuniversal primary education, sustainable socioeconomic development, and equity in Bangladesh\u2019s \nsociety, as envisaged in the Millennium Development Goals. The objective of PEDP-II is to provide \nquality primary education to all eligible children in Bangladesh. It has four components: (i) quality \nimprovement through organizational development and capacity building, (ii) quality improvement in \nschools and classrooms, (iii) quality improvement through infrastructure development, and (iv) \nsupport for more equitable access to quality schooling.     \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved PEDP-II on 3 November 2003. It was \ndeclared  effective  on  19  April  2004,  and  implementation  started  on  1  July  2004.  PEDP-II  is \nfinanced jointly by the Government of Bangladesh and 11 development partners.2 Financing totals \n$1.815  billion,  including  $1.161  billion  from  the  Government  (64%)  and  $654  million  from \ndevelopment partners (36%) over 6 years. The Government share includes $864 million from its \nsources for stipends to 40% of the poorest children. ADB\u2019s loan amount is equivalent to $100 \nmillion from its Special Funds resources. As the lead agency, ADB also is administering grant \ncofinancing of $389 million. The Prime Minister launched PEDP-II in September 2004. As of 30 \nJune 2006, disbursements reached $122 million from the development partners\u2019 share, which \nincludes $20 million from the ADB portion. \n \n3.  PEDP-II is the first SWAp in the primary education subsector in Bangladesh. It is anchored \nin the macro plan for the primary education subsector. PEDP-II includes a comprehensive policy \nand  reform  framework,  as  well  as  key  performance  indicators  and  targets  in  the  program \nframework, which are being integrated into the Government\u2019s recent medium-term expenditure \nframework. Thus, PEDP-II brings together the Government and development partners working in \nprimary  education  under  one  coherent  program.  In  addition  to  reducing  duplication  and  the \nprevious fragmented project-based  approach (10 development partners and about 20 projects), \nPEDP-II  promotes  harmonization  between  the  Government  and  development  partners. \nConsequently, the transaction costs of the Government and development partners decreased. \nFurther,  efficiency  of  coordination  increased  through  harmonization  in  financial  management, \nprocurement, reporting, audits, planning, monitoring and evaluation, and joint review missions. \n \n4.  Implementation Arrangements. The Directorate of Primary Education (DPE), acting under \nthe guidance of Ministry of Primary and Mass Education (MOPME), is the Executing Agency. DPE, \nthrough  its  line  divisions,  is  integrating  PEDP-II  activities  as  part  of  its  regular  program  and \nadministrative structure. MOPME has established a program steering committee, headed by the \nsecretary of MOPME, to oversee the work of DPE and overall implementation of PEDP-II. A \nprogram coordination unit, which is considered an integral part of program management at DPE, \nhas been established to support DPE in coordinating, implementing, and monitoring the PEDP-II \nthrough DPE line divisions, with the support of the technical support teams. At the regional level, \ndivisions  and  districts  will  perform  important  supervisory  activities  and  play  support  roles  in \nimplementing  PEDP-II,  with  increased  functional  authority  and  responsibility  expected  to  be \ndevolved to the upazila (subdistrict) and school level. On behalf of the development partners, ADB \nhas established a program liaison unit (PLU) as an extended part of the Bangladesh Resident \nMission  exclusively  to  (i)  administer  the  implementation  of  the  PEDP-II;  (ii)  support  the \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2003.

The MOPME secretary organizes quarterly meetings for policy dialogue and discussions \nbetween the senior government officials and development partners on important implementation \nissues. The principal secretary also chaired a meeting recently to support the creation of a primary \neducation cadre. \n \n6.  An in-depth review of the progress of PEDP-II is carried out jointly once a year by the \nGovernment  and  development  partners  under  two  major  arrangements:  (i)  thematic  review \nmission, and (ii) joint annual review mission (JARM). While the thematic review mission focuses on \nspecific  issues  or  topics  (i.e.,  themes),  such  as  implementation  of  school-level  planning  and \nteacher development, the JARM covers all important activities in the four components of PEDP-II. \nIn addition, DPE provides a quarterly progress report to ADB\u2019s PLU, which is shared with the \ndevelopment partners with comments. The report also is discussed with the development partners \nduring  quarterly  and  special  consortium  meetings.  Further,  ADB\u2019s  PLU  regularly  shares  with \ndevelopment  partners  the  findings  of  field  visits  and  follow-up  discussions  with  DPE  on \nimplementation. This mechanism is being strengthened with possible participation of development \npartners. \n \n7.  Progress to Date. The findings of the JARM, conducted 24 April\u20138 May 2006, confirmed \nthat the Government has taken full responsibility for significant areas of policy formulation and \nimplementation,  and  is  taking  the  lead  in  ensuring  the  effective  implementation  of  PEDP-II \nactivities. This is the key to successful implementation of any SWAp. In particular, the Government \nhas (i) taken the necessary steps to establish the primary education cadre, which is a major policy \ninitiative under PEDP-II; (ii) transferred 11,000 staff, including 9,000 primary teachers, from PEDP-I \nto the revenue budget; (iii) recruited 14,200 new teachers (the target is 35,000); (iv) printed and \ndistributed 65 million textbooks for grades 1\u20135 to all primary schools; (v) trained 17,000 primary \nschoolteachers under the 1-year, pre-service Certificate in Education conducted by 53 primary \nteachers training institutes (PTI) across the country; (vi) developed policy and strategy papers for \nhuman resource development, gender action plan, vulnerable action plan, and tribal education \nplan;  and  (vii)  established  the  national  assessment  cell  at  DPE  under  PEDP-II,  and  primary \ncurriculum  wing  at  the  National  Curriculum  and  Textbook  Board  (NCTB).  Infrastructure \ndevelopment  has  made  significant  progress  in  the  past  2  years,  and  the  results  are  highly \nsatisfactory: (i) about 14,000 classrooms (of 30,000 targeted) are close to completion; (ii) new \ntoilets for teachers have been constructed in 3,387 of 6,613 government primary schools (GPS); \n(iii)  2,768  of  4,096  arsenic-free  tube  wells  have  been  installed;  and  (iv)  construction  and \nrehabilitation works in districts, upazilas, upazila resource centers, and PTIs are progressing well. \n \n8.  In  terms  of  policy  reforms,  steps  have  been  taken  to  implement  the  school-level \nimprovement plans and the innovation grant scheme at the school level. Pilot upazilas and schools \nhave been selected, and innovation grant manual has been approved to initiate the first round of \nawards. In addition to free textbooks for all students in elementary schools, DPE has invited \nprinters and publishers to bid for the printing of the first round of 18 titles of supplementary reading \nmaterials for grades 1\u20135. Writers are preparing manuscripts for the second round of supplementary \nreading materials for distribution to all schools. The Government has taken steps to fill essential \nvacancies by accelerating the recruitment process, and providing the necessary budgets for the \npositions in  NCTB,  National  Academy  for  Primary  Education,  PTIs,  district  primary  education \noffices, upazila education offices, upazila resource centers, and positions within DPE. While the \nprogress has been satisfactory, MOPME and DPE need to expedite the process to ensure that \nimportant positions are filled urgently, preferably before the midterm review (MTR) in the first half of \n2007.  \n \n   ", "32        Appendix 2 \n9.  MOPME has streamlined and expedited teacher recruitment, shortening the process from \n16 months to 7 months, while recruiting 14,200 teachers to link with the completion of 14,000 new \nclassrooms. Females comprise 60% of the recruits, increasing the proportion of female teachers \nfrom the current 40%. Good progress also has been made in making access more equitable, with \nthe establishment of access and inclusive education cell in DPE, and the development of an \nInclusive Education Framework and Strategies and Action Plans for inclusive education. Efforts are \nunderway to include and attract disabled children in schools, in line with a Government circular \nissued at the end of 2005.  \n \n10.  During the Joint Annual Review Mission (JARM 2006) held in April-May 2006, Government \nagreed to develop a governance strategy for primary education. With the technical support teams \nabout to be fielded, the finalization and implementation of institutional analysis, human resources \ndevelopment strategy, and further consolidation of reforms, such as the school-level improvement \nplans, innovation grant, teacher development, and student assessment, should be possible. All of \nthese will have a direct impact on schools and classrooms.   \n \n11.  One of the most important developments is the achievement and the availability of baseline \ndata, which allows results-based monitoring of performance indicators. The Government also has \nmade significant efforts at harmonization, including (i) the use of a common withdrawal application \nfor ADB and World Bank; (ii) common financial management rules (FMR) reporting; (iii) common \naudits; (iv) common reporting; and (v) procurement, with about 85% of all procurement in line with \nthe national system.   \n \n12.  Next Steps. JARM 2006 recorded that a lot of progress has been achieved against targets \nat the operational level, including increased capacity and confidence of DPE in many areas. JARM \nalso recognized that operational issues have to be anchored on further reforms, such as (i) \nimproving the modality and organization of teacher development; (ii) improving communications \nand establishing a shared vision of school quality; and (iii) strengthening institutional efficiency, \nincluding using of technical assistance effectively to ensure quality and impact of inputs. MOPME \nhas established a joint working group to prepare for the MTR, with representatives from DPE and \ndevelopment  partners  to  address  priority  areas,  such  as  (i)  simplifying  the  current  program \nframework to ensure realistic targets and indicators and results-based monitoring; (ii) making \nprogram document flexible for a more effective utilization of available resources; and (iii) expanding \nand/or establishing interface with other programs, such as early childhood education and school \nfeeding program, and additional facilities through community participation and/or partnership with \ncivil society to complement quality and equity.  \n \n13.  Reform Agenda. With a view to ensuring that PEDP-II goals and objectives are achieved, \nthe following reform agenda has been prioritized and needs concerted efforts: (i) establishment of \na  primary  education  cadre;  (ii)  professional  development  of  teachers;  (iii)  decentralization  of \nfinancial management and administrative responsibility to support improved service delivery at the \nschool level; (iv) national assessment; and (v) strengthening of the capacity for good governance, \nincluding  preparation  of  a  comprehensive  governance  strategy.  In  addition,  further  work  on \nharmonization, as well as development partner collaboration, is necessary to make the process \nmore participatory and complementary, as the Government and development partners learn to \nwork collaboratively under a SWAp.  \n \n14.  To  address  the  challenges  of  a  program  of  this  magnitude,  ADB  is  working  with  the \nGovernment  and  development  partners  to  strengthen  program  management  through  greater \ndevelopment partner collaboration, policy dialogue with Government, and greater focus on results-\nbased  monitoring.

Secondary Education System and Outcomes \n \n1.  General Secondary Enrollments. Total primary enrollments in Bangladesh have more \nthan tripled since 1970\u2014from some 5.3 million children in 29,000 institutions to 18.4 million \nchildren in 87,000 institutions in 2003. The proportion of female enrollments increased from \nabout 32% to 53% over the same period. For 2003, the official total gross enrollment rate for \nprimary education was 104.8%, and the female gross enrollment rate was 108.4%. The net \nenrollment rate were 86.7% overall and 87.4% for girls (2002 data). Despite continuing high \ndropout and low completion rates over the primary cycle, and indications that basic skills are not \nattained, these high primary enrollment rates have had a major effect on enrollments in the \nsecondary schools.   \n \n2.  In the three decades since the 1970s, the number of general secondary institutions \noffering grades 6\u201312 tripled and enrollments in grades 6\u201312 increased more than 500%.  For \ngirls, however, the rate of increase was about 1,680%, while boys\u2019 was about 310%, altering the \nratio of girls to boys in secondary education from 1:5 in 1970 to 1.1:1 in 2003. The expansion in \nsecondary education\u2014double that of the rate of increase in primary education over the same \nperiod\u2014is a result of population increase and higher demand for secondary education. Thus, for \n2003, the gross enrollment rate for secondary grades 6\u201310 was 45.2%, compared with 30.2% \nfor 1993, and the female gross enrollment rate was 50.8% in 2003, compared with 28.7% for \n1993.  \n \n3.  Education Outcomes. The general secondary education system continues to have low \ninternal and external efficiency and quality of output due to the massive increase in access to \nsecondary education, and the concomitant difficulties in rapidly changing curricula, teaching and \nassessment, and examination processes. Despite continuing improvements in performance, for \nevery 100 students newly enrolling in grade 6, less than 20 will attain the secondary school \ncertificate (SSC), based on the current data and examination pass rates. Of those who continue \nschool, less than 10 will attain the high secondary certificate (HSC). Moreover, considerable \nanecdotal evidence suggests that even the small minority who graduate through the secondary \neducation  system  are  not  well  prepared  for  modern  tertiary  study,  particularly  in  terms  of \nanalytical and learning skills, and English. A 1997 study found that the majority of the university \nteachers  of  a  sample  of  entrants  from  HSC  believed  that  most  students  entered  higher \neducation with inadequate knowledge and skills, weak English, and an attitude that was less \nthan ideal for higher education. HSC graduates were observed to be poorly prepared for higher \neducation and weak in practical work.1 \n \n4.  Monitoring and Quality Control. Secondary education in Bangladesh is characterized \nby public-private partnerships. In the general secondary school system, only 1.8% of the 17,386 \nsecondary  schools  offering  grades  6\u201310  in  2003  were  government  schools.  In  the  alia \nmadrasah system (see para. 9), all are private (nongovernment). The Government recognizes \nnongovernment schools through the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (BISE), \nand  alia  madrasah  through  the  Bangladesh  Madrasah  Education  Board.  Nongovernment \ninstitutions enroll 96% of all students in grades 6\u201312. The large majority of nongovernment \nschools  (88%)  and  madrasah  (87%)  receive  government  funding  through  the  payment  of \nsubsidies,  which  cover  80%  of  teacher  salaries.  Without  more  effective  systems  for  the \nmaintenance and development of quality, the gains from increased participation, access, and \n                                                 \n1  Mian, M., R.B.

Dhaka: Ministry of Education. \n   ", "34        Appendix 3 \nequity,  and  the  improvement  in  examination  performance  will  not  occur  across  the  entire \nsystem.  \n \n5.  The main issue emerging regarding the performance of the secondary education system \nin Bangladesh is monitoring and quality control. Traditionally, independent education boards \nexercised  academic  control  of  secondary  education.  High  standards  apparently  were \nmaintained in what was a small-scale system with a clear selective purpose directed at higher \neducation. Further, the traditional pattern of nongovernment establishment, ownership, and \ncommunity management of schools contributed to the development of highly selective, well-\nendowed, well-managed, and prestigious institutions. With the emergence of mass education, \ncentral academic control by the boards has become virtually impossible. Local management \nand  control  through  the  statutory  school  management  committees  (SMC)  is  frequently  ill-\ninformed and ineffective. In many cases, it seems to be motivated by something other than the \nprovision of quality education. \n \n6.  Since  this  expansion  has  been  financed  significantly  through  government  salary \nsubsidies (subventions) to newly established nongovernment institutions, the development has \noccurred  outside  of  the  government  planning  processes.  Appropriate  ongoing  support  and \nquality assurance processes are lacking, which means that almost all schools operate outside of \nany government control or monitoring.   \n \n7.  The quality problems of general secondary education in Bangladesh go across most \ninstitutions, and involve all aspects of the education process. Curricula are inappropriate for the \nmajority of students. Teaching days and hours per year are significantly lower than general \nstandards elsewhere. Teacher accountability appears to be increasingly absent, while teacher \nperformance in terms of attendance and teaching is declining. Further, private out-of-school \npaid coaching, allegedly frequently by the teachers themselves, appears to be increasing. The \nphysical  resources  of  schools  have  become  overcrowded,  dilapidated,  and  ill-equipped  for \nmodern teaching.   \n \n8.  In 2003, less than half of secondary teachers had professional training. Current pre-\nservice secondary teacher training programs tend to be dominated by subject content, despite \nthe graduate status of their entrants, and formal theoretical courses about education. As a \nresult, attention to the development of teaching skills is lacking. Thus, teaching in the schools\u2014\nand student learning\u2014tend to be dominated by the rote learning of facts to the exclusion of \nlearning processes, and personal skills and values. Textbooks have reflected this concentration \non  rote  learning,  and  alternative  instructional  materials  are  generally  unavailable  and/or \nconsidered irrelevant. Across the secondary system, major problems exist in the teaching of \nEnglish and mathematics, and most students who fail SSC do so because of poor performance \nin  these  subjects.  Assessment  and  examination  processes  bear  little  relationship  to  the \nobjectives of the curriculum, and reinforce the concentration on rote learning.    \n \nB.  Madrasah Education  \n \n9.  Structure  and  Provision.  Bangladesh  inherited  three  types  of  Islamic  educational \ninstitutions:  \n(i)  Furqania  or  hafizia  and  nurani  madrasah  (maktabs),  which  offer  pre-primary \nelementary education with basic knowledge of Islam and memorization of the Qur\u2019an. \nThese are privately owned and funded.  \n(ii)  Alia madrasah, which offer religious and general subjects at the primary level, grades \n1\u20135  (ibtedaye);  junior  secondary  and  secondary,  grades  6\u201310  (dakhil);  higher \nsecondary, grades 11\u201312 (alim); degree (fazil); and masters (kamil). All but three \ngovernment institutions at the kamil level are privately owned and managed, though \n ", "    Appendix 3  35\nthey are recognized by the Government and receive government salary subsidy in \nthe same manner as recognized general secondary nongovernment schools and \ncolleges. \n(iii)  Qaumi  madrasah,  which  emphasize  religious  and  general  education  to  varying \ndegrees from primary to university levels. These are privately owned and funded by \nIslamic  charities,  individuals,  and  communities.  They  are  outside  of  government \nregulation or supervision; sometimes provide accommodation for orphans, homeless \nchildren, and the destitute; and offer basic job training center facilities, as well as \nIslamic education.   \n \n10.  Madrasah  Enrollments.  Enrollment  data  for  madrasah  are  not  comprehensive  or \nreliable. The Government only has information available on alia madrasah. Enrollment data from \nthe Bangladesh Bureau of Educational Information and Statistics (BANBEIS) for dakhil and alim \nalia madrasah indicate that about 2.75 million students are enrolled in about 7,215 madrasah by \nabout 102,000 teachers. About half of those enrolled are females. Between 1970 and 2003, \nBANBEIS estimated that the number of alia madrasah institutions increased almost sixfold (from \n1,518 to 8,410), and their enrollments increased twelve-fold (from 283,000 to 3.4 million). Post-\nprimary  general  education  institutions  increased  threefold,  and  their  enrollments  increased \nalmost fivefold, over the same period. By about 2000, many coeducational alia madrasah were \noperating, although girls-only madrasah remain a small proportion of the total.  \n \n11.  Alia  Madrasah  Curriculum  The  alia  ibtedaye  (primary)  have  a  comprehensive \ncurriculum of basic Islamic and general education, which allows students to enter either general \nor madrasah secondary school. At the dakhil level (grades 6\u20138 and 9\u201310), the alia madrasah \nteach studies of the Qur\u2019an (Muzwid), memorizing of the Qur\u2019an (Hifzul Qur\u2019an), humanities, and \nscience. Almost equal weight is given to religious and general education. However, the common \nperception appears to be that students graduating from grades 6\u201310 are likely to be relatively \nweak in general subjects. Students registering for alim (higher secondary) level can elect from \none of two subject groups: humanities or science. In all, four religious subjects and two general \nsubjects (i.e., Bengali and English) are compulsory for both groups. Students are required to \nregister for six other subjects depending on their specialization. \n \n12.  Madrasah Teachers and Teaching. Most teachers in the alia and qaumi systems lack \npre-service professional training. Limited system-wide in-service training is available to alia \nmadrasah teachers through the sole government Madrasah Teacher Training Institute, Gazipur. \nThe decentralized nongovernment examinations boards for the qaumi madrasah also provide \noccasional  in-service  teacher  training.  Training  is  generally  in  subject  content  rather  than \npedagogy. Madrasah teaching appears to encourage passive learning by students, who are \nexpected to learn by recitation and rote. Limited library and other resources are available to \nstudents or teachers, and extracurricular activities are reportedly less common than in the \ngeneral education schools.  \n \n13.  Learning  Outcomes.  The  dropout,  completion,  and  pass  rates  in  the  Madrasah \nEducation Board\u2019s alia madrasah dakhil and alim examinations are generally similar to the \ndropout  or  completion  rates  of  the  general  secondary  schools,  and  to  the  results  at  the \ncomparable  levels  under  the  secondary  education  examination  boards.  Both  show  the \ncompounded effects of high dropout and low pass rates. Overall, the majority of students who \nenter the alia madrasah system either drop out or fail.2 For alia madrasah students, the official \nequality of their qualifications with those of the general education institutions offers opportunity \nfor formal transfer to the general institutions at various levels. While many students succeed in \ndoing so, some have a harder time due to their relatively weaker general education. As with \n                                                 \n2 Overall, systematic data is not available for the quami madrasah.  \n   ", "36        Appendix 3 \ngeneral education, the problem of quality of outcomes of madrasah education involves all of the \ninterconnected  variables  of  the  education  process:  planning,  management,  curriculum, \ntextbooks, teaching processes and teacher training, student assessment and examinations, and \nthe physical facilities and equipment of the schools. The systematic improvement of all these \naspects is necessary.   \n \nC.   Financing of Secondary Education  \n \n14.  As  a  proportion  of  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP),  government  expenditure  on \neducation averaged of 2.2% between FY1998-99 and FY2003-04 (Appendix 7). The proportion \nof government expenditure on education averaged 15.2% per year during 1999\u20132004, and has \nremained at 15% and above except in FY2003-04 when it dipped to 13.9%. Primary education \nreceived  an  average  annual  share  of  45.1%  of  the  education  budget  since  1999,  while \nsecondary  education  received  an  average  annual  share  of  43.2%.  Education  spending \naveraged  17.1%  of  government  revenue  from  1998-99  to  2003-04,  while  development \nexpenditure  on  education  averaged  12.9%  during  the  same  period.  Government  revenue \nallocations  to  the  education  institutions  show  considerable  variation  by  level  and  type  of \ninstitutions. Government costs for nongovernment institutions (Tk1,174 per student) are almost \nentirely  for  salary  subventions,  and  account  for  about  a  quarter  of  the  funds  allocated  to \ngovernment secondary school students.  \n \nD.  Professional and Management Support and the Education Agencies  \n \n15.  Curriculum,  Textbooks,  and  Teaching  Materials.  The  National  Curriculum  and \nTextbook Board (NCTB) has been responsible for preparing curriculum, as well as developing, \npublishing, and distributing textbooks for primary and general secondary education. Recent \ninitiatives have helped the NCTB to increase its in-house capacity and expertise for the review \nand development of secondary curriculum. A specialist Secondary Assessment Unit (SAU) has \nbeen  established  within  NCTB  with  trained  staff  to  assist  the  schools  with  school-based \nassessment. Secondary textbooks are being privatized in a phased manner, enabling students \nand teachers to choose books and initiate a textbook improvement process. The Independent \nTextbook Evaluation Committee has been established, and processes for its independent legal \nstatus were started in late 2005. \n \n16.  Student Examinations. The seven BISEs conduct public examinations after grades 9\u2013\n10  (SSC)  and  grades  11\u201312  (HSC).3 A  new  Bangladesh  Examinations  Development  Unit \n(BEDU) was established with specialist staff trained abroad and locally. The BISE system is \ndivided into seven independent BISEs. This is administratively convenient, as each BISE can be \nresponsible for a manageable area and number of candidates. From a quality perspective, \nhowever, the independence of the BISEs is problematic. It means that seven different papers \nand seven different sets of marking criteria are used for one examination, making comparisons \nof standards from one region to another impossible. Standards seem to vary widely from one \nBISE to another. The seven BISEs also results in fragmentation of capacity. In effect, seven \ngroups of people set and moderate papers, plan marking etc., where one could do it for all. No \nmeans are currently available for holding the BISEs accountable for their procedures or outputs. \n \n17.  Management Training. The National Academy for Educational Management (NAEM), \nDhaka, is the sole agency providing training for secondary education administrators and head \nteachers. It is also responsible for the provision of foundation training to newly appointed \n                                                 \n3 BISEs are also responsible for the granting recognition to nongovernment schools against the prescribed standards, \nand periodic monitoring; and the registration of schools and colleges for entry of students to SSC and HSC \nexaminations. \n ", "    Appendix 3  37\neducation cadre of the Bangladesh Civil Service. NAEM soon will be transformed into an apex \nbody for the coordination of teacher training and teacher professional development.  \n \n18.  Education Statistics. The BANBEIS was established as an information, statistics, and \ndata  service  for  the  secondary  education  sector.  The  functioning  of  BANBEIS  has  been \nconstrained  by  the  continuing  problems  of  timely  collection  of  accurate  data  in  a  system \ncharacterized by (i) large numbers, (ii) primarily private ownership of institutions, (iii) difficult \naccess, and (iv) continuing problems in communicating with many schools. Accuracy of data \nprovision depends on the responding schools, and most data transfer continues to be manual. \nAs a result, publication of annual data is delayed by more than 12 months, reducing its utility for \nplanning, management, and system monitoring.  Further, the lack of effective data verification \nmechanisms casts doubt on the completeness and accuracy of the supplied data.  \n \n19.  Audit  and  Compliance.  The  Directorate  of  Inspection  and  Audit  (DIA)  has  basic \nresponsibility for the accountability of nongovernment schools that receive government salary \nsubsidy and other assistance, and for their compliance with the conditions of assistance. DIA is \nunable  to  monitor  schools  and  colleges  adequately  because  of  its  fixed  staff  allocations. \nSubcontracting of basic audit functions to independent audit firms is not overcoming the major \nissue, and DIA\u2019s staff are now unable to inspect each institution more than once every 9\u201310 \nyears.   \n \n20.  Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education (DSHE). A director general heads \nDSHE,  Dhaka,  of  the  Ministry  of  Education.  The  main  functions  of  the  DSHE  are  to  (i) \nadminister the government secondary schools and colleges, (ii) administer agreed government \nassistance to the recognized nongovernment secondary schools and colleges, (iii) supervise \nand control aided projects, and (iv) supervise the effective implementation of the system. DSHE \nhas  four  operational  wings,  each  headed  by  a  director:  (i)  college  (with  the  additional \nresponsibility for administration and finance), (ii) secondary (with additional responsibility for \nmadrasah and special education), (iii) training, and (iv) planning and development. The planning \nand development wing of DSHE has lacked adequate resources for ongoing, in-house research, \ndata  collection,  and  analysis  as  a  basis  for  policy  support,  planning,  and  monitoring  and \nevaluation. A specialist Policy Support and Planning Unit was established within the wing in \n2002 under a deputy director to provide increased expertise in these areas. The program \nmonitoring unit (PMU) monitors the female stipend components of various projects. The large \nscale and rapid expansion of secondary education in Bangladesh has rendered traditional \nmechanisms for school support and monitoring inadequate to ensure the maintenance of quality \neducation across the entire system.   \n \n21.  System Staffing, Specialization, Appointment, Promotion, and Transfer. Almost all \nadministrative, management, and professional agency positions in DSHE and the Ministry of \nEducation agencies are filled by members of the education cadre\u2014most commonly by transfer \nor deputation. Thus, college teachers fill virtually all such posts in BANBEIS, BISE, DIA, DSHE, \nNAEM,  NCTB,  and  teacher  training  colleges,  irrespective  of  the  specialist  needs  for  the \npositions. This model has survived despite the decline in the size of the government education \ncadre relative to the enormous and rapid expansion of the nongovernment system and the \ndevelopment of mass secondary education. It has also survived despite the emergence of the \nnew  professional  education  specializations  common  elsewhere\u2014educational  management, \ncurriculum development, educational technology, student assessment, and examinations. The \nresult is that the staff of DSHE and the education agencies are not always appointed with the \nrequired specialist qualifications or experience in the areas in which they will work. The problem \nis  of  particular  concern  in  the  staffing  of  positions  that  are  directly  related  to  secondary \neducation\u2014teacher  education,  curriculum  development,  examination  development\u2014and  for \nwhich education cadre officers have little or no skills or experience. \n   ", "38  Appendix 4 \nACTIVITIES OF THE GOVERNMENT AND DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS IN THE \nSECONDARY EDUCATION SUBSECTOR, ACTIVE IN 2006 AND BEYOND  \n \nName of Project and  Major Project Objectives  Development Partners \nEffective Dates \n1.

Secondary Education Sector Finance \n1.  Budget  allocations  to  the  education  sector,  which  is  designated  as  a  priority  sector  in \nBangladesh, have increased substantially in the past three decades. The education sector budget as \na percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) rose from 1% in 1970s to 3% in the mid-1990s. The \npercentage has decreased slightly to 2.4% since FY2002. Despite the drop in the recent years, \neducation sector accounted for the largest portion of the Government budget at approximately 14\u2013\n15%. However, the education budget level as a percentage of GDP is lower than the average of \nother less developed countries (3.8%) and of developed countries (5.8%). In South Asia, India\u2019s \neducation budget is 3.7% of GDP, Sri Lanka\u2019s 3.4%, and Nepal\u2019s 2.9%. \n \n2.  Secondary education sector is financed under Ministry of Education (MOE). MOE shared \neducation sector budget equally with the Ministry of Primary and Mass Education (MOPME) in \nFY2000-01.  However,  while  the  MOE  budget  continued  to  grow  at  around  8\u201314%  per  year, \nMOPME\u2019s grew more slowly and was reduced to FY2001-02 level in FY2003-04 (Table A8.1). As a \nresult of the drop in the MOPME budget, the education sector budget in FY2003-04 did not grow \nmuch from FY2002-03. Of Tk67.4 billion education budget, 43% (Tk29.0 billion) was allocated to \nsecondary education (Table A8.2), while 42% (Tk28.0 billion) went to primary education. Since then, \nthe financing trend has not changed significantly. \n \nTable A8.1: Education Budget1 FY2001\u20132006 \n(Tk million) \nItem  FY2000-01  FY2001-02  FY2002-03  FY2003-04  FY2004-05  FY2005-06 \nGovernment Expenditure  385,240   423,060   448,540   519,800   572,480  643,830 \nEducation Sector Budget  55,670   60,280   67,100   67,400   76,800  94,870 \nProportion of Government  14%  14%  15%  13%  13%  15% \nBudget \n             \nMOPME  27,240   28,380   32,560   28,010   32,920  38,280 \nMOE  28,430   31,900   34,540   39,390   43,880  56,590 \nFY = fiscal year, MOE = Ministry of Education, MOPME = Ministry of Primary and Mass Education.  \nNotes: (i) To examine the initial commitment of the Government at the beginning of each financial year, the figures are \nbased the original budget.

The secondary education sector has been trying to meet the growing demand of \nstudents who complete primary education. However, the quality of education has declined due to the \ninability to cope fully with this demand. Primary enrollments in Bangladesh have more than tripled \nsince 1970\u2014from some 5.3 million children in 29,000 institutions to 18.4 million children in 87,000 \ninstitutions in 2003. Despite continuing high dropout and low completion rates in primary education, \nthe  substantial  increase  in  primary  enrollment  has  had  a  major  effect  on  enrollments  in  the \nsecondary schools. In the three decades since 1970, the number of general secondary (grades 6\u2013\n12) institutions in Bangladesh increased threefold, while enrollments grew almost sixfold. As a result \nof  the  Second  Primary  Education  Development  Program,1   further increases  in  the  number  of \nstudents who complete primary education are expected, which will require more general secondary \neducation institutions to make access more equitable. \n \n4.  With  the  Increasing  demand  for  general  secondary  education,  commercially  oriented \ninstitutions  have  expanded  quickly,  making  quality  control  by  the  Government  more  difficult. \nTraditionally, before mass education, independent education boards exercised academic control of \nsecondary education, and high standards were maintained in small-scale institutions with a clear \nselective purpose directed at higher education. With the emergence of mass education, the boards\u2019 \ncapacity for academic control was overwhelmed by the scale and breadth of entry. Increases in \nenrollment resulted in a decline in the quality of teaching. Schools have become overcrowded. \nTeaching  days  and  hours  per  year  are  significantly  lower  than  general  standards  elsewhere. \nCoupled with the lack of quality control by the Government, teachers have become increasingly less \naccountable, while their performance in terms of attendance and teaching has declined. As a result, \nthe internal efficiency of secondary education has worsened. From 1999 to 2003, the dropout rates \nbetween grades 6 and 10\u2014for boys and girls\u2014have increased substantially (65% in 1999 to 83% in \n2003). Boys\u2019 dropout rates have climbed from 61% to 80%; girls\u2019 dropout rates have risen from 68% \nto 86%. \n \n5.  The decline in the quality of teaching in classes cannot be attributed solely to the shorter \nduration of teaching. The lack of professional skills among teachers is another factor. In 2003, less \nthan half of secondary teachers had professional training. For those who do receive pre-service \nsecondary teacher training, the programs focus on subject content, rather than the development of \nteaching  skills.  Thus,  teaching  processes  in  the  schools  and  student  learning  tend  to  remain \ndominated by rote learning of facts. For most children, secondary education offers little chance for \nscholastic success. The programs, curricula, and teaching practices do not provide opportunities for \nobtaining basic learning and analytical skills for the workplace. \n \n6.  The Government updated the Secondary Education Sector Development Plan 2000\u20132010 to \naddress  access,  efficiency,  and  effectiveness  in  secondary  education,  and  to  extend  its \nimplementation  through  2013.  The  updated  document  is  entitled  Secondary  Education  Sector \nDevelopment Plan 2006\u20132013 (updated SE-SDP) (see Supplementary Appendix A), which refined a \nseries of strategic interventions for the strengthening of planning, management, and delivery of \nsecondary education. SE-SDP identified the four major areas of opportunities for improvements: (i) \nthe number of secondary education institutions, (ii) monitoring structures and mechanisms, (iii) \nteacher training, and (iv) curriculum content. \n \n7.  Sector  Reform.  The updated SE-SDP includes five reform objectives: (i) strengthening \nsystem  management,  (ii)  enhancing  the  quality  of  secondary  education,  (iii)  strengthening  alia \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003.

By  estimating  the  additional  activities  required  to  achieve  the \nobjectives, SE-SDP established the costs of reforms at $302 million between 2006 and 2013. \nFurther, to sustain the reformed management system of the secondary education subsector, an \nadditional $57 million will be incurred for staff salary (Table A8.3).  \n \nTable A8.3: Cost of Secondary Education Sector Reforms 2006\u20132013 \n($ in million) \nReform Objective and/or Component  Amount \nStrengthening System Management  23.3  \nEnhancing Quality of Secondary Education  170.2  \nStrengthening the Alia Madrasah  21.7  \nEstablishing ICT Laboratories  42.9  \nEnhancing Access and Equity  43.8 \nAdditional Administrative Staff  56.5 \nTotal  358.4 \nICT = information and communications technology. \nSource: Secondary Education Sector Development Plan 2006\u20132013. \n \n8.  Financing Sector Reform. All reform activities require additional financial resources to the \nGovernment budget. Some of the costs were financed by an ongoing project, or will be financed by a \nproposed project. The Teaching Quality Improvement Project,2 for example, is an ongoing project \nthat will provide $109 million in financing to strengthen teacher education to enhance the quality of \nsecondary  education.  Also,  the  investment  part  of  the  proposed  Secondary  Education  Sector \nDevelopment  Program  will  finance  $113  million  to  assist  reform  components  with  limited \ngeographical  coverage.  Increments  in  the  development  budget  will  be  needed  to  finance  the \nremaining activities. \n \n9.  Development  Budget  during  Reform.  To  estimate  the  available  government  financial \nresources,  the  budget  for  the  secondary  education  subsector  between  2006  and  2013  was \nestimated in real terms (Table A8.4). The estimate incorporates the main assumptions used in the \nmedium-term macroeconomic framework in the National Strategy for Economic Growth, Poverty \nReduction  and  Social  Development,  an  International  Monetary  Fund  staff  report, 3 and  the \nBangladesh Public Expenditure Review. The GDP growth rate is assumed to be constant at 4.0%, \nand the government budget as a proportion of GDP remains at the level of FY2005-06 between \nFY2005-06 and FY2012-13. \n \n10.  Two additional assumptions are made. First, all financial resources for the reform will be \ndrawn first from the development budget and gradually from the non-development budget in later \nyears. Second, the level of the development budget in FY2005-06 is earmarked to finance the \nexisting  activities  until  its  financial  sources  are  shifted  to  non-development  budget.  The  result \nindicates that approximately $118 million will be available as an increment in the development \nbudget between FY2005-06 and FY2012-13 for secondary education subsector reforms (Table \nA8.5). \n \n11.  Need for Budget Support. Despite the large size of the increments in the budget, as well as \nthe financial assistance from the Asian Development Bank for the two projects, an additional $26.6 \nmillion is still needed during the 8-year reform period to finance secondary education reforms.

New School Construction and Additional Classrooms \n \n1.  Unions1 in areas that are not served or are underserved will qualify for the subproject \nassistance for construction of new secondary schools or addition of new classrooms. Unions will be \nidentified by school mapping. Communities at the union level will have flexibility in determining the \ntype of assistance to be requested. If the area is at high risk of disasters, such as floods or \ncyclones,  the  school  will  be  of  disaster-resistant  (school-cum-shelter)  design.  If  an  existing \nsecondary school is overcrowded, additional classrooms will be considered.  \n \n2.   District implementation coordination committees (DICC) will be established in each district \nwith unions that qualified under the subproject. Chaired by the district education officer, DICCs also \nwill  include  representatives  from  the  district  education  engineering  directorate  (EED), \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGO),  concerned  school management  committees  (SMC),  and \nhead teachers. DICCs will visit the area to talk with the local communities. The discussions will \ninclude participation of all members of the community. The aim of the discussion will be to build \nconsensus  for  joint  community  and/or  government  support  for  ensuring  equitable  access  to \nsecondary education, including for girls, tribal people, the poor, and other disadvantaged groups. \nWith the assistance of EED, DICCs will prepare an appraisal report for the proposed subproject.  \n \n1.  Indicative Criteria for Selection of New Schools (Regular) to be Constructed \n \n3.   The unions and the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education (DSHE) will adopt the \nfollowing guidelines for the selection, preparation, and appraisal of the schools to be included in \nthe union subproject for construction: \n \n(i)  Availability of land that is vacant and free from encumbrances, with no residential or \ncommercial structures and no productive use. It must be donated by the community \nor Government-owned, with a minimum area of 0.4 hectare, and in an environment \nconducive to teaching and learning. If a regular secondary school is to be provided, \nthe land must be above the average annual flood level in the area concerned. On \nbehalf of DSHE, EED and the construction supervision consultants will examine the \nsuitability of the land for construction. \n(ii)  Availability of junior secondary school in the catchment area of the prospective \nschool to generate at least 280 prospective secondary school students (80 in grade \n9, 80 in grade 10, 60 in grade 11, and 60 in grade 12). \n(iii)  Absence of another secondary school (grades 9\u201310 or intermediate college, grades \n11\u201312) within at least 3 kilometers of the site of the school, except in places with \nnatural barriers or high population density.2 \n(iv)  A catchment area population of at least 4,600 for a coeducational secondary school \nand 9,200 for a single-sex secondary school. \n(v)  Demonstrated  community  interest  and  involvement,  including  commitment  to \nundertake preventive maintenance programs. \n \n2.  Indicative Criteria for Selection of Schools for Additional Classrooms and \nFemale Toilets in Existing Schools \n \n4.

Links to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Bangladesh: \n \nThe Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) of the Government of Bangladesh, adopted in November 2005, aims to halve \nthe number of people living in poverty by 2015, in line with the Millennium Development Goals. It establishes a road \nmap for improving the living standards through a general multisector approach to poverty reduction, concentrating \nreform in seven major areas: (i) employment, (ii) nutrition, (iii) maternal health, (iv) sanitation and safe water, (v) \nquality education (primary, secondary, and vocational), (vi) criminal justice, and (vii) local governance. \n \nThe main policy interventions made for quality education and poverty reduction include references to secondary \neducation, which are (i) basic primary education and life skills for all; (ii) promotion of access to secondary and higher \neducation; (iii) facilitation of gender equity in education and empowerment of women; (iv) curriculum development, \nteachers\u2019 education, and restructuring management to improve the quality of education; and (v) prevention of dropouts \nat secondary and higher secondary level. The major recommendations for secondary education include, among \nothers, reforms and recommendations relating to decentralization, school-based management and assessment, \nteachers career paths, equity and gender, and improved performance.  \n \nThe reforms will contribute to better sector governance, increased system efficiency, more efficient use of resources, \nand enhanced access to and quality of secondary education for all. The enrollment rates at the secondary level are \nstill low, though female enrollment rates have increased significantly. However, the system is characterized by internal \ninefficiency, as demonstrated by low retention rates and poor results on the part of students. Dropout rates average \n52% for secondary education grades 6\u201310 (53 % for girls), and 41% for higher secondary education grades 11\u201312 \n(40% for girls). The major problem is poor teaching quality. Poor and disadvantaged students are affected the most, \nbecause they rarely have other educational options, and cannot afford the fees for additional tuition.  \n \nWhile girls\u2019 enrollment has improved significantly, their performance and retention in secondary education are \ndetermined by several factors, including the lack of female teachers. Students\u2019 poor results in the secondary school \ncertificate and higher secondary school certificate examinations, especially in the majority of rural schools, are \nindications of extensive waste. Even successful secondary school graduates find that obtaining gainful employment is \ndifficult, partly because of the irrelevance of the school curriculum to the labor market\u2019s needs. All these factors \ndiscourage the poor and disadvantaged from pursuing secondary education. Most of the underserved population is \npoor, landless, and rural, representing about 80% of the poor. Most of the benefits of secondary education are reaped \nby the better-off. The bottom 20% of families receive 6% of the benefits of secondary education, while the top 20% \nreceive about 35%. \n \nEducation is the basis of socioeconomic transformation and advancement, and plays a major role in reducing the \nworst effect of poverty. Globally, education has been linked to a number of poverty-reducing behaviors: (i) reduced \nfertility rates are noticeable, even among women with minimal education; (ii) health practices improve and participation \nin health clinics increases with education; (iii) farmers with education tend to obtain higher yields; and (iv) market \nactivity increases in areas where education has been established for some time. The effects of education carry across \ngenerations. People who have been exposed to education view themselves and their roles within the community \ndifferently than those without such exposure. Nationwide, even a modest exposure to education reduces poverty \nlevels substantially. When the head of a household has had only 1\u20134 years of schooling, that household is 37% more \nless likely to be below the poverty line. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "    Appendix 15       67     \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification:  General Intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nBangladesh has made good progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. In education in 2003, the \nprimary gross enrollment rate was 105% and gender parity was achieved in the primary and secondary education \nlevels. In the other indicators, Bangladesh\u2019s population growth rate was halved over two decades, and infant mortality \nrates decreased by a quarter between 1989\u20131993 and 1995\u20131999. \n \nUsing the 2003 human development index, Bangladesh was ranked in the medium human development category for \nthe first-time. Despite making good progress on poverty and human development indicators, Bangladesh remains one \nof the poorest countries. Although the proportion of people living in poverty decreased from about 59% to 50% \nbetween 1991\u20131992 and 2000, half of the country\u2019s citizens still live below the national poverty line, and about 4 in 5 \nof the poor live in rural areas. Among those living in poverty in 2000, 3 in 4 live in households with an illiterate head. \nThe incidence of poverty decreases as the educational attainment of the household head increases. In 2000, World \nBank estimated the gross enrollment rate among the poor to be less than a fifth of the non-poor\u2019s. Regions with high \nlevels of poverty are those with lesser access to public services and lower achievements, as measured by human \ndevelopment indicators.  \n \nMany rural areas are still underserved in the provision of secondary education, which necessitates new schools and/or \nexpansion of existing of facilities. The ongoing Secondary Education Sector Improvement Project has assisted the \nconstruction of 59 new schools in underserved areas identified through school mapping. Congested schools have \nreceived additional classrooms and toilet facilities. As gender parity has been achieved in secondary education \nenrollment and secondary education enrollment gap is observed between the rich and the poor, a study is underway \nexamining poverty-targeted stipends for secondary school students.  \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nDuring  project  preparation,  participatory  consultations  were  held  with  different  stakeholders  in  the  Ministry  of \nEducation (MOE), local communities, nongovernment secondary schools, staff of the ongoing Secondary Education \nSector Improvement Project, and students. Stakeholder views were sought on various secondary education issues, \nincluding  factors  affecting  student  enrollment,  madrasah  enrollment,  and  school-based  assessment.  National \nworkshops were held to present the interim report and the draft final report.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nThe Program addresses issues to improve the quality and management of secondary education throughout the \ncountry. Through the planned national implementation of the education management information system (EMIS), data \nwill be available to inform policy makers on the coverage of secondary education, particularly in underserved areas. \nTo strengthen schools, school management committee (SMC) members, who include parents and community leaders, \nwill  be  provided  training  to  help  them  with  school  development  and  improving  student\u2014and  thus  school\u2014\nperformance. In planning and implementing new school construction, district implementation coordination committees \nwill involve local communities.  \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nTo encourage female enrollment in secondary education, the Government is providing stipends to girls and expanding \nschool facilities to accommodate increased female enrollment. Enrollment figures in 2003 indicate that Bangladesh \nhas achieved gender parity in secondary education enrollment, though dropout rates are still marginally higher for \ngirls.  \n \nThe Secondary Education Sector Development Program aims to contribute to poverty reduction by improving the \nquality of secondary education. Equity of access by girls to secondary education is an important agenda to achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals, towards which Bangladesh has steadily progressed. Women\u2019s effective participation \nin educational institutional and in educational management is expected to contribute to their poverty reduction and \nsocial development.  \n ", "68  Appendix 15 \nThe gender action plan factors the gender concerns into all project components to promote women\u2019s participation \nequally as agents and as beneficiaries in secondary education system (Appendix 14.) Achievements of girls\u2019 in the \nsecondary education will facilitate their progression to higher education and increase their competitiveness in the labor \nmarket. Girls, who constitute half of the pupils in the secondary education level, need to be prepared for their future \nemployment and decision-making roles through quality education. Similarly, women are forming a major part of \neducation providers, yet women\u2019s contributions often go unrecognized. The gender action plan aims to (i) increase \nwomen\u2019s participation as students and stakeholders in education, (ii) increase women\u2019s social benefits from the \nProject, (iii) develop women as contributors to the educational management system, and (iv) support women\u2019s \nempowerment in decision making and public life. \n \nHas an output been prepared?

The  Secondary  Education  Sector  Development  Program  (SESDP)  will  implement \nreforms to improve the quality, equity of access, and management of secondary education \nnationwide.  As  such,  SESDP  will  benefit  all  schools\u2014government  and  nongovernment\u2014\nincluding  those  in  rural  areas.  It  will  also  benefit  all  secondary  school  students,  including \nmembers of tribal communities. The tribal people\u2019s development framework is in Supplementary \nAppendix F.  \n \n2.  Strategy.  During  project  implementation,  the  following  strategies  are  included  to \nfacilitate addressing issues affecting tribal people:   \n \n(i)  In the Chittagong Hill Tracts and other parts of Bangladesh that have tribal \npeople and are underserved, new schools and classrooms will be established to \nhelp ensure that equitable access to quality secondary education is available to \nall children. The new secondary schools will be established in underserved areas \nmeeting the criteria: (a) no other school within 3 kilometers, (b) minimum of 280 \nstudents, and (c) a minimum population of 4,600 for a coeducational secondary \nschool. \n(ii)  Given  the  poverty  faced  by  many  tribal  people,  the  Project  is  reducing  the \nbarriers that prevent tribal people\u2019s children from accessing and participating in \ngeneral secondary schools by introducing poverty-targeted stipends.      \n(iii)  The  project  loan  will  support  the  construction  of  schools  in  at  least  five \nunderserved thanas (subdistricts) where tribal people live, which meet the criteria \nfor civil works. \n(iv)  The project loan will support the construction of additional classrooms in at least \n25 schools that meet the criteria for civil works, and are located in thanas where \ntribal people reside.  \n(v)  A social development and gender specialist will be engaged to support program \nimplementation. Among other things, the specialist will help develop a situation \nanalysis,  strategy,  and  action  plan  for  the  participation  of  tribal  people  in \nsecondary education.  \n(vi)  The project implementation unit and the Directorate of Secondary and Higher \nEducation (DSHE) will collect project baseline data disaggregated by tribal group. \nThereafter, they will collect regularly and maintain data disaggregated by tribal \ngroup in its database.  \n(vii)  PIU, in cooperation with DSHE, will analyze project outputs and impact indicators \nregularly, including by tribal group. \n(viii)  In recruiting new teaching staff for new schools, built with project funds, serving \ncommunities with tribal people, priority will be given to those who are from the \nimmediate community.    \n \n3.  Procedures.  A  tribal  people\u2019s  development  framework  is  a  policy  and  procedural \nframework  for  tribal  people\u2019s  development  plans  that  are  developed  for  subprojects, \ncomponents, or investments, and that are to be approved during loan implementation. The \nGovernment will prepare a specific action for tribal people for subprojects with limited impacts \non tribal people, or when the project might not bring intended benefits to the affected tribal \npeople  within a specific plan. The tribal people\u2019s development plan, or tribal people\u2019s specific \n \naction, will be submitted to the Asian Development Bank for review and concurrence. \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20061106163856+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20061004132954+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - BAN-SESDP- Final.doc", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2", "Author": "JDA", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)"}, "author_page": " \nVice President  L.
