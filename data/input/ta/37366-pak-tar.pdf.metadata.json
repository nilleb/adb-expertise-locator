INTRODUCTION \n1.  The First Sindh Devolved Social Services Program (SDSSP-I) was approved by the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) on 12 December 2003 for $220 million, and became effective \nin April 2004.1 The Program has been successfully implemented, with most tranche conditions \nmet  on  time.  Despite  the  progress  and  achievements  of  SDSSP-I,  Sindh  province  faces \nformidable and complex developmental challenges. The Government of Pakistan requested that \nADB provide assistance to Sindh province for deepening policy reforms initiated under SDSSP-I \nand  expanding  social  sector  investments  to  consolidate  the  gains  of  SDSSP-I.  A  related \ntechnical assistance (TA) was requested for the preparation of the Second Sindh Devolved \nSocial Services Program (SDSSP-II). The TA Fact-Finding Mission took place in March 2006. \nDuring that Mission, an agreement was reached with the Government on the TA\u2019s impact and \noutcome, scope, cost and financing, and implementation arrangements. The TA is included in \nthe Pakistan country strategy and program update 2006\u201320082 for 2006, while the loan is \nincluded for 2008.3 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Background.  Whereas  Sindh  has  the  highest  per  capita  income  among  the  four \nprovinces in Pakistan, it is the second least developed province in terms of human and social \ndevelopment. Human development indicators in Sindh have been improving slowly, as outlined \nin Appendix 2. The situation in rural Sindh is daunting, especially for girls. In rural areas, girls\u2019 \nnet enrollment rate in primary schools is only 29%, while the rate for boys is 45%. According to \nthe Sindh Education Management Information System (2002\u20132003), 63% of enrolled boys and \n71% of enrolled girls in rural areas dropped out while moving from grade 5 to grade 6, while 9% \nof boys and 3% of girls dropped out in urban areas. Health indicators also show a substantial \nrural\u2013urban gap. The percentage of fully immunized children (aged 12\u201323 months) is 87% in \nurban areas, but only 62% in rural areas. Only 40% of pregnant women receive prenatal care in \nrural areas, whereas 70% do in urban areas. The situation with access to drinking water and \nsanitation has been improving gradually in recent years. Still, only 56% of households in rural \nareas have access to tapped or pumped water, and 27% lack toilets.  \n \n3.  When asked about the single most important development objective for the province in \nthe medium term, 6 out of 10 policy makers chose \u201chuman development.\u201d4 Consistently low \nlevels of public investment in the social sector, lack of accountability to the public, and limited \nplanning and management capacity of executing bodies have been the most common causes of \nthe social sector\u2019s underperformance. In August 2001, the Government introduced the Sindh \nLocal Government Ordinance (SLGO) on the premise that locally managed basic services \nwould  improve  responsiveness  to  local  needs  and  improve  delivery,  since  localized \nmanagement generates political commitment and greater accountability to the public. Three \nlevels  of  local  governments  were  created,  entailing  political,  financial,  and  administrative \ndevolution. In Sindh, this initiative created 23 district governments, 119 taluka (town) municipal \nadministrations  (TMAs),  and  1,044  union  administrations  to  function  as  autonomous  local \nbodies with their own responsibilities, financial shares, and revenue sources. The SLGO has \nhad a promising start in creating social sector reform opportunities. SDSSP-I was conceived in \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003.

Washington, DC. \n ", "2   \nthis context to provide financial and technical support to the Sindh provincial government (SPG) \nto improve devolved social services and thus improve human and social indicators. \n \n4.  SDSSP-I  Progress  To  Date.  SDSSP-I  aims  to  help  reduce  poverty  and  gender \nimbalances by improving people\u2019s education, health, and access to water supply and sanitation \n(WSS). It especially focuses on improving the governance and financing of social services. \nSDSSP-I targets five principal policy reforms: (i) further devolution of social services to local \ngovernments; (ii) increased social sector financing; (iii) improved participation and accountability; \n(iv) rationalized services and setting minimum standards; and (v) promotion of public\u2013private \npartnerships  (PPPs)  to  improve  service  delivery.  SDSSP-I  also  includes  a  TA  loan  to  (i) \nstrengthen  social  sector  and  program  management  and  monitoring,  (ii)  develop  local \ngovernments\u2019 and community-based organizations\u2019 governing capacity in social services, and (iii) \nsupport work on specific policy reforms. SDSSP-I supports policy reforms at the provincial level \nand provides fiscal and technical support for education and health in district governments, and \nfor WSS in TMAs. \n \n5.  As outlined in Appendix 3, SPG has made significant headway in the last 2 years in \nimplementing  the  policy  reforms  and  introducing  innovative  approaches.  One  of  the  most \ninnovative  approaches has been the conditional grant mechanism. Under this mechanism, \nfinancial support for local governments is transferred from SPG through conditional grants that \nare allocated based on a formula determined by the Provincial Finance Commission (PFC). The \ngrants (\"PFC awards\") increase local governments\u2019 budget predictability and transparency. This \ngrant mechanism was the first of its kind in Pakistan. SDSSP-I also introduced annual sector \nplans to initiate rational, evidence-led, priority-based planning at the local government level. As \nimplementation of the TA loan gathers momentum, capacity development of stakeholders is \nexpected to accelerate and enable SDSSP-II to launch on stronger footing.  \n \n6.  Some  social  sector  indicators  have  improved  since  the  introduction  of  SLGO  (see \nAppendix 2). Between 2001\u20132002 and 2004\u20132005, the percentage of children (aged 12\u201323 \nmonths) fully immunized in rural areas increased from 33% to 62%, and prenatal consultation in \nrural areas increased from 17% to 40%.  Improvements in education have been more gradual, \nhowever. Girls\u2019 primary school net enrollment rate increased from 40% to 48%. \n \n7.  SDSSP-II.  SPG  requires  additional  time  and  resources  to  deepen  and  sustain  the \ndevolution and reforms of social service delivery. The Government requested that ADB support \nthe second generation of policy reforms to deepen devolution, building on the experience of \nSDSSP-I. SPG has stressed the importance of maintaining momentum for reform and avoiding \na gap between implementation of SDSSP-I and implementation of SDSSP-II. To ensure that \nlessons learned from SDSSP-I are fully reflected in SDSSP-II, SPG is undertaking a midterm \nreview of SDSSP-I before the TA begins. \n \n8.  SDSSP-I and II should be regarded as a continuum, sharing the goal of helping SPG \nreduce poverty and gender imbalances by improving people\u2019s education, health, and access to \nWSS. Based on the experience of SDSSP-I, SDSSP-II will put more emphasis on social sector \npolicies to improve the quality of social services, and will deepen governance reform in line with \nthe SLGO. The issues that SDSSP-II, building on SDSSP-I, will address are outlined below.  \n \n9.  Quality of Social Services. SDSSP-I helped SPG establish a mechanism to transfer \nfinancial resources and administrative social services responsibilities to local governments. \nProvincial line departments (PLDs) are responsible for overall quality control and should design, \ndisseminate, and enforce technical and service standards; local governments should execute \n ", "  3\nthe policies and strategies accordingly. A health sector reform policy and an education sector \nplan have been developed, and WSS and solid waste management polices have been drafted. \nThese policies and plans will benefit from clarification of implementation arrangements, and \nestimation of budgetary requirements. Quality assurance mechanisms\u2014including a monitoring \nand evaluation system\u2014and minimum standards for services at different government levels and \nservice providers must be adopted for these policies and plans to be effective.  SDSSP-II should \nassist SPG in building (i) the capacity of provincial line departments to carry out quality control \nand assurance and formulate sound social sector policies; (ii) strategic planning capacity and \nmanagement capacity of local governments; and (iii) technical capacity of the service delivery \nsystem.  \n \n10.  The PFC awards should be allocated in such a way that encourages local governments \nto synchronize their investment priorities with provincial social sector policies. This will require \ncareful design to balance the budgeting and planning autonomy of local governments with the \nneed for leadership from provincial line departments in developing sector policies and strategies. \n \n11.  Administrative  and  Fiscal  Management.  Inconsistencies  between  the  SLGO  and \nexisting laws and regulations often either prevent local governments from operating effectively \nas independent government tiers, or lead to operational and legal friction between different tiers \nof government. The role of local governments, which often have fewer managerial and financial \nresources than the provincial government, tends to be diluted. The roles of provincial and local \ngovernments should be rationalized, and administrative arrangements should be made to reflect \nthe new legal mandates. It is also important to ensure that local governments have sufficient \nand qualified staff to handle their increased responsibilities.  \n \n12.  The gap between expenditure and revenue needs to be narrowed by a mechanism \nwhich allocates adequate resources for the social sectors in an objective, effective, transparent, \nand  predictable  way.  The  PFC-award  mechanism  should  be  further  improved  to  meet \nexpenditure needs and provide incentives for better performance. It is also important for local \ngovernments to generate more revenue.  \n \n13.  Poverty Targeting. The Government is committed to reducing poverty and targeting \nsocial  service  delivery  to  the  vulnerable  segments  of  society.  Targeting  may  be  done  by \nselecting pro-poor policies and allocating more resource toward poorer districts and population \ngroups. SDSSP-I originally used the human development index (HDI) to rank social deprivation \nand determine the amount of the conditional grants. It is necessary to identify a more accurate \nbut feasible means of targeting resources and interventions at poor and/or vulnerable segments \nof the population. \n \n14.  Public\u2013Private Partnership. There are several successful PPP models in Sindh that \ncould be scaled up. To further promote PPPs, the concept must be broadened beyond the \nconventional association of PPPs with nongovernment organizations. Partnerships with the for-\nprofit private sector must also be considered. A broad strategy must be developed that includes \nclear and transparent guidelines for private sector participation in social service delivery.  \n \n15.  Accountability. SLGO stresses public accountability and transparency. Strengthening \nthe Sindh Local Government Commission, the PFC, the Director General Audit, the local fund \nauditors,  and  the  zila  mohtasib  is  crucial  to  effectively  mitigating  fiduciary,  political,  and \nadministrative risks. Additional innovative approaches, such as citizens' report cards, may also \nbe explored to involve direct recipients of social services in monitoring.  \n \n ", "4   \n16.  Implementation  Arrangements. SDSSP-I\u2019s Executing Agency is the Department of \nFinance, and funds have been disbursed to local governments through the PFC. As a result, \nsome provincial line departments have not actively participated in SDSSP-I. There is a need to \nidentify a stronger, clearer role for provincial line departments\u2014not only in program issues and \nengagement with local governments, but also in program and project management.  \n \n17.  External Assistance. The need for effective donor coordination is particularly acute in \nSindh's education sector. Apart from the ADB-financed Decentralized Elementary Education \nProject,5 the European Commission is planning to launch assistance in October 2006, while the \nWorld Bank-supported education policy framework is in its advanced stage of development. The \nresource  needs  of  Sindh's  education  sector  are  substantial  enough  to  absorb  all  of  this \nassistance. However, for such external assistance to be effective, SPG needs to exercise \nstronger leadership in coordinating projects and setting a common policy framework. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n18.  The impact of the TA will be to improve people\u2019s education, health, and access to WSS, \nwith special attention to gender imbalances, to achieve Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \nThe outcome of the TA will be an effectively designed SDSSP-II comprising a program and a \nproject or TA that will improve social services delivery and benefit the poor in health, education \nand WSS. The program will support SPG in implementing social sector reforms and deepening \ngovernance  reforms  in  accordance  with  the  SLGO.  The  project  or  TA  will  support \nimplementation of the program through investment or capacity building activities. The outputs of \nthe TA will be: (i) a comprehensive assessment of SDSSP-I that looks at intermediate social \nsector outputs and outcomes, the feasibility of innovative approaches, and lessons learned; (ii) \nidentification of social sector policies that achieve MDGs, fulfill the needs of social service users, \nand  target  the  poor;  and  (iii)  administrative,  financial,  and  accountability  mechanisms  for \ndevolved social services that will help SPG, local governments, and communities make social \nservices more efficient, equitable, and sustainable. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n19.  The TA will have three phases. The first phase is a comprehensive assessment of \nSDSSP-I,  including  (i)  an  assessment  of  SDSSP-I's  impacts  and  the  current  status  of  its \nimplementation in light of SLGO; (ii) identification of various implementation gaps in terms of \nboth sector and devolution policies; and (iii) suggestions for social sector reforms and devolution \nmechanisms  that  will  help  achieve  MDGs.  The  first  phase  will  end  with  a  provincial-level \nconference to share the findings and discuss possible improvements. The second phase will \nfocus on (i) designing a program that addresses social sector and devolution policies and \ncontains actions to further devolve and improve social service delivery, and (ii) designing an \nassociated project or TA that will help SPG build capacity at different administrative levels in \norder to improve service delivery. The effectiveness of each policy and action should be gauged \nby measurable indicators. Baselines for these indicators should be established. The third phase \nwill help SPG prepare to implement SDSSP-II. Concrete activities to be supported in the third \nphase will be identified by the end of the second phase. The TA should be implemented in a \nparticipatory manner, involving a range of stakeholders. Programs supported by the federal, \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2002.

Manila. \n ", "  5\nprovincial, and local governments, and other development agencies will be taken into account to \navoid duplication and increase synergy. The initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 4. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $750,000 equivalent. The Government has \nrequested ADB to provide $600,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The remaining $150,000 will be \ncontributed by the Government and will include office accommodation, utilities, transport, and \nremuneration  of  counterpart  staff,  and  administrative  support.  The  Government  has  been \ninformed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. The cost \nestimates and financing plan is in Appendix 5. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  6  months\u2014tentatively  from  mid-February  to  mid-\nAugust 2007. The TA will start after release of the third tranche of SDSSP-I and completion of \nthe midterm review of SDSSP-I. SPG's finance department will be the Executing Agency for the \nTA. The provincial steering committee of SDSSP-I will provide overall policy guidance to the TA. \nThe provincial steering committee is chaired by the Additional Chief Secretary, Planning and \nDevelopment, and comprises representatives of the SPG departments of finance, education, \nhealth and population welfare, and local government; representatives of district governments \nand  TMAs;  and  nongovernment  representatives.  SPG  will  select  the  local  government \nrepresentatives to reflect the geographical, cultural, and economic diversity of the province. \nDuring the implementation phase of the TA, the committee will meet at least once every 2 \nmonths to monitor TA implementation. The project director of SDSSP-I will be the project \ndirector of the TA. The counterpart staff designated by departments concerned (including health, \neducation, and local government) for SDSSP-I will continue to be the counterpart focal staff for \nthe TA, and will work with the consultants. SPG's finance department, through SDSSP-I, will \nalso provide support staff. The TA office will be established in the office of the program support \nunit of SDSSP-I after the TA signing, and will have utilities, furniture, and local telephone \nservices. \n \n22.  ADB will engage 8 person-months of international consultants and 36 person-months of \ndomestic consultants through an international firm. The experts will include a governance and \ninstitutional development specialist and team leader; a public resource management specialist; \nan education sector specialist; a health specialist; a water supply and sanitation specialist; an \nenvironmental  specialist;  a  public\u2013private  partnership  specialist;  a  social  scientist;  a \nmanagement and human resources specialist; and a monitoring and evaluation specialist. ADB \nwill engage a consulting firm using quality-  and cost-based selection procedures in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (April  2006).  Consultants  will  procure \nequipment in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April 2006). The outline terms of \nreference are in Appendix 6. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Pakistan for preparing the Second Sindh Devolved Social Services Program, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n  Performance  Data Sources/ Reporting  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved education,  By 2012, in Sindh province:  \u2022 Government economic  \u2022 There is macroeconomic \nhealth, and WSS  \u2022 Net primary school  and social sector  stability, and economic \naccess, with special  enrollment rate  statistics  growth is maintained \nattention to gender  increased by 50% from  \u2022 Pakistan Integrated  \u2022 Both the federal and \nimbalances, to achieve  the 2007 level  Household Survey  and  provincial governments \nMillennium  \u2022 Reduce gender  other household surveys  sustain political \nDevelopment Goals  differential in school  \u2022 Third party assessments  commitment to human \n  enrollment by 50% from  and validation  development \n  the 2007 level   Risk \n\u2022 Infant mortality rate  \u2022 Federal or Sindh \nreduced by 30% from  provincial government \nthe 2007 level  political commitment to \n\u2022 90% of children fully  devolution diminishes \nimmunized  (The forthcoming 2007 \n\u2022 Access to drinking water  election will be a test of \nand sanitation system  that commitment)  \nincreased by 50% from \nthe 2007 level  \n \nOutcomes      Assumption \n       \nAn effectively designed  MOU for appraisal signed  MOU  \u2022  There is continued \nSDSSP-II and project  by the Government and  political will and \nor TA that will benefit  ADB.   commitment to \nthe poor in health,  institutionalize devolved \neducation and WSS,  local government system \nand will make social   \nservices more efficient,  Risk \nequitable, and  \u2022  Some departments wish \nsustainable. \nto recentralize or \n \nweaken pro-poor policy \nfocus \n\u2022  Capacity of local \ngovernments, which is \nsupposed to be \nstrengthened under \nSDSSP-I, remains weak. \nOutputs of the TA      Assumption \n1.

The overall goal of the First Sindh Devolved Social Services Program (SDSSP-I) is to \nimprove people\u2019s education, health, and access to water supply and sanitation (WSS), thus \nhelping reduce poverty and gender imbalances. SDSSP-I provides a framework for pursuing \ncrucial policy reforms at the provincial level. SDSSP-I also provides fiscal and technical support \nto help local governments provide devolved social services; supports education and health at \nthe district level; and supports taluka (town) municipal administrations (TMAs) in providing WSS. \nSupport for local governments is through formula-based conditional grants that increase budget \npredictability  and  transparency.  SDSSP-I  is  groundbreaking  in  that  is  the  first  program  in \nPakistan  to  introduce  conditional  grants  in  line  with  the  provisions  of  the  Sindh  Local \nGovernment Ordinance (SLGO) of 2001. Twelve services\u2014including education, health services, \nand WSS\u2014were devolved by the Government of Pakistan to local governments in 2001. In \naddition, SDSSP-I introduced annual sector plans (ASPs) as instruments to initiate rational, \nevidence-led,  priority-based  planning  at  the  local  government  level.  These  ASPs  promote \ndistrict- and sector-wide approaches, outline proposed funding sources, and suggest effective \nways to use social sector funds. \n \n2.  SDSSP-I targets five principal policy reforms: (i) further devolution of social services to \nlocal  governments;  (ii)  increased  social  sector  financing;  (iii)  improved  participation  and \naccountability; (iv) rationalized services and setting minimum standards; and (v) promotion of \npublic\u2013private  partnership  to  improve  service  delivery.  Program  support  for  province-wide \ndevolved social services is provided over 3 years, while support for a technical assistance to \nstrengthen social sector development is provided over 4 years. \n \nA.  Status of Project Implementation \n3.  A provincial program steering committee, headed by the Additional Chief Secretary \n(Planning & Development), with the secretaries of health, finance, education, local government, \nnazims, and civil society representatives as members, provides policy oversight and guidance \nfor SDSSP-I. To manage operations and the various activities under SDSSP-I, a program \nsupport unit has been established, with senior officers of the Government of Sindh acting as \nprogram  director  and  deputy  program  director.  Provincial  line  departments  contribute  five \nprogram officers\u2014in health, education, WSS, monitoring and evaluation, and administration\u2014as \nwell  as  support  staff.  The  program  support  unit  has  recruited  a  procurement  specialist,  a \nparticipatory  planning  specialist,  a  finance  and  governance  specialist,  a  monitoring  and \nevaluations specialist, and a Provincial Finance Commission (PFC) consultant; recruitment of \nseveral other consultants is at an advanced stage. The Sindh Provincial Government (SPG) has \nnominated the executive district officers for finance and planning to be the focal persons for \nSDSSP-I at the district government level. SPG is also establishing local support units in all \ndistricts; staff and finance and governance officers have been mobilized in 23 local support units. \nThese local support units will provide direct technical support to districts and TMAs. \n \n4.  SPG  is  using  the  $110  million  in  ordinary  capital  resources  funds  provided  under \nSDSSP-I to retire debt and thereby create fiscal space for social sector reform. It has already \nretired $67 million worth of the most expensive debt in FY2005. The savings generated through \nthis  debt  retirement  process  will  be  channeled  through  PFC  to  improve  delivery  of  social \nservices. The Asian Development Fund is provided on top of the province\u2019s own budget funds, \nand are earmarked for onward transfer to local governments as conditional grants through PFC. \nThe first tranche of \u00a57,289,935,000 and SDR23,048,000 was released on 6 May 2004, and the \nsecond tranche of \u00a54,025,785,000 and SDR23,048,000 was released on 14 July 2005. The third \n ", " 10  Appendix 3 \nand final tranche is expected to be released in October 2006. The distribution of these grants is \nbased on an objective, transparent formula, and transfer to local governments is based on \napproved ASPs.  \n \nB.  Achievements \n5.  Despite the many implementation challenges that the new modalities and innovative \napproaches bring, SPG, to its credit, has made several significant achievements under the \nSDSSP-I policy framework. These include: \n(i)  Implementation  of  formula-based,  performance-oriented,  transparent  transfers \nunder the PFC-approved conditional grant mechanism. This grant mechanism \nwas the first of its kind in Pakistan and is considered a model for other donor-\nfunded grant mechanisms. The grant mechanism details eligibility requirements \nand access conditions that districts and TMAs must meet to qualify for PFC fund \ntransfers. These conditions are articulated in a memorandum of understanding, \nwhich serves as the legal contracting instrument and which was developed in \nconsultation with provincial and local governments. For 2005\u20132006, the Sindh \nPFC  has  changed  the  formula  to  50%  on  population,  30%  based  on  the \ndeprivation index, 10% on inverse population density, and 10% on performance. \nThe conditional grants under the SDSSP-I have been allocated based on a \nsimilar distribution formula\u201450% based on population, 30% on backwardness, \n10% on equal share, and 10% on performance\u2014and divided among districts, \nwhich have received 70% of grant funds (for education and health) and TMAs, \nwhich have received 30% (for water and sanitation). \n(ii)  Introduction of need-based, organized, participatory planning processes at local \nlevels by developing ASPs in 15 out of the then 16 districts in Sindh, and in 63 \nout of the then 102 TMAs. \n(iii)  Providing  incentives  and  focusing  on  more  efficient  use  of  existing  assets, \noperationalization of facilities, and consolidation of ongoing activities by local \ngovernments, with limited new schemes. \n(iv)  Development and publication of institutional-restructuring papers by all provincial \nline departments to reflect their new roles and responsibilities in line with SLGO \n2001. \n(v)  Expansion  of  support  for  public\u2013private  partnerships  and  community-based \norganizations  through  increased  financial  assistance  for  school  management \ncommittees, and introduction of health boards. \n(vi)  More predictable, regular, and transparent funds flow for non-salary allocations \nfrom provinces to local governments, enabling higher expenditures on operations \nand maintenance. \n(vii)  Paving the way for second-generation devolution reforms through a Delegation of \nPowers  Plan,  approved  by  the  chief  secretary,  which  aims  to  devolve  more \nadministrative and financial powers to local governments. \n(viii)  Memorandums of understanding signed with all 23 district governments, and \n92% of the TMAs. \n(ix)  77% of the available Asian Development Fund ($33 million) transferred to the \nlocal governments, and 48% of those funds utilized. Sector allocation in the \ndistrict governments has been as follows: 54% education and 46% health. \n(x)  Drafting  of  the  first-ever  Sindh  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  solid  waste \nmanagement policies.  \n ", "  Appendix 4  11 \nINITIAL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS  \n \nA.

No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Sindh province of Pakistan: \n \nNearly 600,000 additional people are seeking jobs each year in Sindh. The long-term job creation rate of \nthe province has been about 350,000\u2013500,000 jobs per year, leaving 100,000\u2013250,000 people to the \nunemployment pool each year. The majority of rural residents are dependent on crop cultivation, forestry, \nfishing, and livestock for their livelihood. Recent droughts have put considerable stress on the livelihoods \nof rural households. Beginning in 1996\u20131997, Sindh experienced 5 consecutive years of unprecedented \nlow rainfall, with annual precipitations of 35 to 80% lower than the long-term average of 500 millimeters. \nPartly as a result of these droughts, the production of major crops in Sindh has failed to keep pace with the \npopulation growth rate in recent years. \n \nThe Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy and program calls for major reforms in public sector \ngovernance, increased budget allocation, and efforts to improve social services. The government of Sindh \nhas prepared a poverty reduction strategy and wants to accelerate devolution in the social sectors. \nDevolution has been under way since August 2001. Local governments are functioning at the district, \ntaluka (town), and union levels. As per the Sindh Local Government Ordinance of 2001, district \ngovernments have been given responsibility for basic education and health services, and taluka municipal \nadministrations have been given responsibility for water supply and sanitation services. The devolution \npolicy anticipates that the local government structure will improve the efficiency of allocating public \nresources according to local needs, and enhance the quality, efficiency, accountability, and ownership of \nsuch services. \n \nAs job creation in the agriculture sector is limited, new job creation depends mainly on the manufacturing \nand services sectors. For sustained and inclusive economic growth, youth from poor households need to \nhave higher human capital to take advantage of increasing job opportunities in those sectors. This \nunderlines the significance of access to good education for the poor. Likewise, improving access to health \ncare and sanitation for the poor will lead to improved human capital among the poor, reduce the likelihood \nof morbidity and mortality, and reduce the likelihood of catastrophic events causing further \nimpoverishment among poor households.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe poverty analysis will use both statistical data and qualitative information. Statistical data to be \nanalyzed will be from household surveys such as the Pakistan Integrated Household Survey and the Multi-\nPurpose Indicator Cluster Survey; qualitative information will be from participatory poverty assessments, \npublished  and  unpublished  studies,  and  participatory  workshops  to  be  conducted  by  the  technical \nassistance (TA). A situation analysis will be undertaken. It will describe the characteristics of the poor in \nSindh; identify districts with high concentrations of poor; review and assess service delivery systems \n(health, education, and water supply and sanitation), particularly in rural areas; identify constraints faced \nby the poor in accessing services; and gauge the capacity of service providers and the service providers\u2019 \nattitude  toward  the  poor.  The  analysis  will  explore  mechanisms  and  strategies  to  involve  poor \ncommunities, elected representatives, and provincial and local government officials, so as to improve the \ndelivery of socials services to poor and marginalized groups. \n \n ", "12  Appendix 4 \n \nThe Second Sindh Devolved Social Services Program will contribute to achieving key Millennium \nDevelopment Goals by increasing the net enrollment rate, reducing the infant mortality rate, improving \naccess to drinking water, and reducing the gender disparity in the school enrollment rate.  \n \n \nC.

Yes                   No \n \nThe TA will engage poverty, gender, and participation specialists whose tasks will include the application \nof participatory approaches to engaging men and women members of rural and urban communities to \nassess the service delivery system and to obtain inputs for designing potential program policy \ninterventions related to local-level planning, for planning and monitoring services and for budget allocation. \nConsultations will be held with officials of provincial government line departments, district governments, \ntaluka municipal administrations, and union councils to identify and analyze devolution-related issues to be \naddressed in the design of the program. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe TA will engage a poverty, gender, and participation specialist. Among other tasks, the specialist will \nexamine the situation using published and unpublished studies and by interacting with women \nstakeholders.
