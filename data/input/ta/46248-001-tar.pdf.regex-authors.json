Strategy  2020  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  names  infrastructure  and \nenvironment as two of the five core areas of operations, and private sector development and \nprivate sector operations as one of five drivers of change.1 Solid waste management (SWM), \none of the most neglected areas of municipal services and infrastructure in Asia, is a pressing \nneed in most developing member countries (DMCs) to help attain environmental sustainability \nand  improve  the  quality  of  life  for  their  citizens.  The  technical  assistance  (TA),  with  its \ncrosscutting focus on infrastructure and environment, fits well with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 and the \nUrban Operational Plan, 2012\u20132020. The TA also ties in well with the country partnership \nstrategy of several DMCs that have singled out sanitation and waste management as a key area \nof assistance for their urban renewal. Yet ADB\u2019s participation in SWM projects in DMCs has \nbeen opportunity-based with limited strategic focus.  \n \n2.  For SWM, ADB has funded only a few projects with more than 1,000 tons/day treatment \nand/or disposal capacity, a common quantum of daily generation of municipal solid waste in \nmany cities in Asia. These projects largely are waste-to-energy applications in the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, funded through the Private Sector Operations Department. Even these \nprojects do not provide a long-term holistic management of municipal solid waste on a citywide \nscale. It is thus evident that ADB needs to raise its effort to help DMCs develop holistic, citywide \nSWM strategies and translate those into technically feasible and commercially viable projects. \nThis  TA  is  a  major  step  in  this  direction.  The  TA  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1.2  \n \n3.  This TA proposes to commence with Armenia and expand into countries covered by \nADB's South Asia Department and Southeast Asia Department. Under the project preparatory \nTA for the Solid Waste Management Improvement Investment Program approved in December \n2011, ADB completed a countrywide assessment of strategies needed to develop municipal \nsolid waste management in Armenia.3 That study recommended dividing the country into five \nregions for the purpose of SWM, and developing and implementing a regional approach to \ncollection, treatment, and disposal facilities to bring in economies of scale. The Government of \nArmenia has requested ADB to undertake detailed feasibility studies for the five regions defined \nin  the  countrywide  SWM  strategy.  German  development  cooperation  through  KfW  and \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) are now working on pre-feasibility \nstudies for two of these five regions. This TA aims to develop SWM projects for the Yerevan \nregion and undertake pre-feasibility studies on segregation, treatment, and disposal of SWM. It \nis noteworthy in this context that the Government of Armenia has recently awarded a public\u2013\nprivate partnership (PPP) contract for collection of municipal solid waste in the city of Yerevan \nand  it  strongly  supports  private  sector  participation.  The  TA  will  thus  effectively  help  the \ngovernment develop and implement an integrated waste management solution for one of the \nkey regions in Armenia. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 14 November 2013.  \n3  ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance to Armenia for Preparing the Solid Waste Management Improvement Investment \nProgram. Manila (TA 7991-ARM). \n ", "2  \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  A recent study by the World Bank indicates that 35% of municipal solid waste in South \nAsia, 25% in East Asia, and 25% in Southeast Asia remains uncollected.4 A large part of the \ncollected municipal solid waste finds its way to unsanitary landfills, causing health hazards and \nreleasing greenhouse gases. In the People\u2019s Republic of China and India alone, the annual \ngreenhouse gas emissions from such landfills are estimated to be 59 million tons of carbon \ndioxide equivalents. Lack of funds and technical skills of urban local bodies, their reluctance to \nengage in long-term contracts, and inadequate policies and regulations to attract finances are \nthe main constraints on effective management of municipal solid waste in Asia. Private sector \nparticipation that can infuse funds, technical skills, and operational efficiencies is likely to be a \nkey element in solving the problem, especially for large and medium-sized cities.5 To date, \nhowever, such participation in SWM has been limited to waste collection contracts, waste-to-\nenergy applications, and a few landfill projects. SWM in a majority of cases has remained a gap-\nfilling exercise with little or no element of holistic proactive planning. This TA tackles these \nissues to help promote long-term planning in SWM.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n5.  The TA aims to develop long-term strategies for integrated SWM for two large and two \nmedium-sized cities, and one small city\u2014the case-study cities (CSCs)\u2014in Asia, translate each \ncity strategy into an action plan that provides basic project structure and bidding procedures, \nand recommend regulatory and policy reforms to attract investments in SWM.  \n \n6.  The  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  that  more  Asian  cities  implement  sustainable  SWM \nstrategies.  \n \n7.  The outcome of the TA will be that city governments in CSCs adopt sustainable SWM \nstrategies. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  The  scope  of  work  under  the  TA  covers  collation  of  information,  analyses,  and \npresentation  of  the  current  status  of  municipal  SWM\u2014e.g.,  waste  generation  trends  and \nestimates; waste characteristics; gaps in collection, treatment, and safe disposal; financing and \ncapacity constraints\u2014in five selected CSCs in Asia, and formulation of a long-term holistic SWM \nstrategy for each CSC. Each city's SWM strategy will contain (i) a workable and cost-effective \ntechnical  solution  for  effective  management  of  municipal  solid  waste;  (ii)  an  estimate  of \nfinancing  needs  and  gaps,  and  recommendations  for  regulatory,  policy,  and  financing \nmechanisms to enable sustainable financing and private sector participation in SWM; and (iii) a \nconcrete action plan that contains basic project structure and bidding procedures.  \n \n9.  The beneficiary cities will be selected from DMCs that are better suited for private sector \nparticipation, such as Armenia, India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand. These countries \n                                                 \n4  D.  Hoornweg  and  P.  Bhada-Tata.  2012.  What  A  Waste:  A  Global  Review  of  Solid  Waste  Management. \nWashington, DC: World Bank. \n5  For the purpose of this TA, a large city is defined as having a population above 5 million, a medium city having a \npopulation between 1 million and 5 million, and a small city having a population below 1 million.   \n ", "  3\nhave been shortlisted in consultation with Private Sector Operations Department because of \ntheir attractiveness for private sector investments in SWM in the present investment climate, \nand with ADB\u2019s regional departments due to their ongoing and projected SWM efforts in their \nregions. Participation by the private sector due to its technical knowhow, operating skills, and \nfinancing ability is considered important to develop effective SWM practices in DMCs. The TA \nwill have the following activities leading to three outputs:  \n \n10.  Output 1:  Five case-study cities selected based on criteria prepared and applied \nfor such selection. The process of selecting the beneficiary cities initially within the shortlisted \ncountries will follow a two-step procedure. First, based on a broad review and findings of the TA \nin Armenia, an inception workshop will explain the scope and methodology of developing the \npre-feasibility studies for the possible pilot to be undertaken later. Similar workshops will then be \norganized in the other shortlisted countries to explain scope and methodology of the TA and \nidentify candidate cities. ADB's respective regional departments will lead the effort. Having \nobtained the acceptance of the countries to participate in the TA, one large and one medium or \ntwo medium-sized cities each in India, Indonesia, and Thailand, and one medium-sized and one \nsmall city in the Philippines, in addition to one city or region in Armenia, will be preselected. If \nnecessary, alternative countries could be considered in South Asia or Southeast Asia. As the \nsecond step, the TA consultant will visit these cities, assess the SWM status, identify technically \nviable SWM options, hold stakeholder consultations, and assess the readiness or willingness of \nlocal  governments  to  undertake  policy  reforms  to  improve  financing  for  environmental \ninfrastructure,  and  to  introduce  transparency  in  decision  making  and  their  commitment  to \nintegrated SWM. Based on this assessment, and using selection criteria developed under the \nstudy, these cities will be ranked. Five CSCs will be selected for the detailed study. The \ndesirable composition of the CSCs is two large and two medium-sized cities, and one small city. \nThe time frame for this deliverable is 8 months.  \n \n11.  Output 2: A 20\u201325-year strategy prepared for sustainable solid waste management \npractice in the case-study cities. For each CSC, the results of the desk review, supplemented \nby the city-specific investigations and consultations, will be analyzed and a draft SWM strategy \nprepared for a time horizon of 20\u201325 years. The strategy is envisioned to contain (i) a city \nprofile, including population and growth, economic activity, expected budgetary support for \nSWM,  willingness  and  ability  to  pay  for  the  services  by  the  consumers,  and  any  other \nparameters  considered  relevant;  (ii)  an  SWM  review  covering  (a)  waste  generation  and \ncharacteristics; (b) existing SWM system, institutions, regulations, and enforcement; (c) financial \nmodalities such as PPPs and external assistance; (iii) a summary of SWM issues, constraints, \nand  opportunities;  (iv)  sector  recommendations  with  strategic  objectives  and  milestones, \ninvestment  requirements  (including  PPP  modalities),  and  an  outline  of  sector  reforms  and \ncapacity-strengthening  initiatives;  and  (v)  a  list  of  projects  that  will  implement  the  SWM \nstrategies and that can potentially be financed by ADB. The time frame for this deliverable is 12 \nmonths (completion by 20th month). \n \n12.  By way of an example, if the SWM strategy for a CSC 1\u2014a large city generating about \n10,000  tons  of  municipal  solid  waste  per  day\u2014finds  the  main  challenges  to  be  waste \ntransportation, treatment, and disposal for two out of three zones (existing infrastructure may be \nadequate for one of the city zones), it may recommend projects to augment transportation (by \nconstructing  transfer  stations  and  procuring  a  long-haul  fleet),  waste  treatment  (by  using \nbiomethanation and waste-to-energy applications), and disposal capacity for residual waste (by \nconstructing sanitary landfills) for zones 1 and 2. For a medium-sized or small city it may be a \nsingle waste treatment facility comprising composting and sanitary landfill. \n \n ", "4  \n13.  Output 3: Action plans prepared for solid waste management projects in the case-\nstudy cities. For each project recommended in output 2, a detailed action plan that contains the \nbasic project structure and bidding procedures will be prepared. A project may opt for a PPP \nform, e.g., a concession. In this case the action plan shall include a term sheet describing the \nkey parties, respective rights and obligations, approximate size of the project(s), key risks, and \nrisk management measures in sufficient detail to form the basis for future project contracts. The \naction plan in this case will also include broad parameters of the bidding process, including \nbasic qualifications of bidders. For medium-sized and small cities, award of a management \ncontract for waste collection and treatment to a private operator, and operation of disposal \nfacilities by the urban local body itself, may be a most suitable option. In this case the detailed \naction plan may include performance indicators for the service providers, minimum period of \nmanagement contract, qualifications and experience of service providers, obligations of the city \ngovernment, and capacity building measures for the local government\u2019s SWM department. The \ntime frame for this deliverable is 10 months (completion by 30th month). \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,400,000, of which (i) $800,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V) and (ii) $600,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by the Urban Environmental Infrastructure Fund6 under the Urban Financing \nPartnership Facility, and administered by ADB.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will be the executing agency. The TA will be implemented by the Regional and \nSustainable Development Department, in coordination with other departments and offices and \nthe  environment  and  urban  development  community  of  practice.7 An  advisory  committee \ncomprising  the  Environment  and  Safeguards  Division  director,  Sustainable  Infrastructure \nDivision director, and sector directors of participating regions will supervise the TA outputs and \nprovide guidance to linking TA outputs with downstream projects for financing by ADB.  \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 3 years and, from January 2014 to December 2016. \nThis includes the time required to seek no-objection letters from the nominated countries, \nappoint the consultants, and undertake the actual  study.  \n \n17.  In its biennium conference on \u201cGlobal Partnership in Waste Management\u201d in Osaka, \nJapan (5\u20136 November 2012), the International Solid Waste Association has shown keen interest \nin  the  TA  concept  and  in  participating  through  technical  reviews  and  dissemination.  It  is \nenvisaged that direct participation by beneficiary municipalities and experience sharing through \nthe International Solid Waste Association and other international forums on SWM will contribute \nto rich knowledge exchange.   \n \n18.  An international consulting firm with proven experience in designing and/or operating at \nleast two SWM projects concerning treatment and disposal capacity in municipal SWM (strategy \nand policy development), feasibility studies and design, procurement and implementation of \nSWM infrastructure (including private sector participation) will be engaged in accordance with \n                                                 \n6  Contributor: the Government of Sweden. \n7 Environment and Safeguards Division, RSDD will lead the development of the SWM strategies and Regional \nSustainable Infrastructure Division, RSDD will lead the pre-feasibility studies for the CSCs.  \n \n ", "  5\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Inputs from \nfive  international  specialists  (24  person-months  total)  and  five  teams  of  three  national \nconsultants  each  (32.5  person-months  total)  are  required.  National  staff  resources  will  be \nequally divided in participating countries. Procurement under this TA will be in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). All disbursements under \nthe TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time). The consulting firm will be recruited following project \nadministration instructions on recruiting consultants through a quality- and cost-based selection \nprocess (90:10).8 Higher emphasis is placed on the technical proficiency of the consultant in the \nselection process because of the pioneering nature of the study, especially in the Asian context. \nThe terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. No TA activities will be financed or \nundertaken in the territory of a DMC until a no-objection letter has been obtained from the \ngovernment of that DMC.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Urban Environmental Infrastructure Fund under the Urban \nFinancing Partnership Facility, and (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent \nof $800,000 on a grant basis, for Mainstreaming Integrated Solid Waste Management in Asia, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n    \n \n \n                                                 \n8  ADB.

The technical assistance (TA) aims to undertake in-depth assessments of the current \nstatus of solid waste management (SWM) in five case-study cities (CSCs) in shortlisted Asian \ncountries (Armenia, India, Indonesia, Philippines, and Thailand) covering institutional, regulatory, \nphysical, environmental, social, financing, cost recovery and public\u2013private partnership  (PPP) \naspects. From this, recommendations will be developed for each city, including outline strategic \nobjectives and milestones, likely investment levels and modalities (including PPPs), and sector \nsupport initiatives necessary to incrementally improve SWM service provision and effectively \nattract private investments. The TA will cover a wide spectrum of population sizes in Asian cities, \nfrom above 5 million (large city) to 1\u20135 million (medium-sized city) to below 1 million (small city).  \n2.  Following is a brief description of the tasks the international and national specialists will \nperform under the TA. \n \n3.
