THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  The  ensuing  project  will  support  government\u2019s  policy  of  strengthening  community \nresilience through rural livelihoods and village infrastructure. This will be done by incorporating \nclimate and disaster risk reduction considerations in planning, design and implementation of \ncommunity projects. The government has requested for $178.2 million loan and $16.8 million \ngrant from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to finance a community based development \napproach  to  deliver  community  infrastructure  and  livelihood  projects  to  25  poor  townships \ncovering  approximately  600,000  households. The  project  will  be  aligned  with  the following \nimpacts under the Rural Development Strategic Framework: (i) incomes of rural households \nimproved; and (ii) resilience of communities to climate and disaster risks strengthened.1 The \nensuing project and transaction technical assistance (TA) is included in the Myanmar Country \nOperations  Business  Plan  2018\u20132020.  It  is  also  consistent  with  the  Myanmar  National \nFramework for Community Disaster Resilience: strengthened climate and disaster resilience of \ncommunity levels through rural livelihoods and village infrastructure. \n \n2.  The project will result in improved incomes of rural households.2  It will have three \noutputs: (i) climate resilient community infrastructure developed; (ii) resilient livelihood activities \nfor women and poor in project areas implemented; and (iii) institutional and organizational \ncapacity of communities and local governments strengthened. These outputs will result in the \nfollowing outcome: living conditions and resilience of selected communities improved.  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Justification \n3.
