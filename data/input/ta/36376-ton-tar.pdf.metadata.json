INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Public Enterprises Act 2002 was enacted in 2002 as part of the Asian Development \nBank\u2019s (ADB) assistance under the Economic and Public Sector Reform Program (EPSRP) \nloan.1 Through implementation of this act, the Government of Tonga initiated a public enterprise \nreform program in 2003 with a fundamental reexamination of the role of the state and its \nengagement in business activities that, under normal circumstances, are better left to the private \nsector. ADB provided technical assistance (TA) entitled Rationalization of Public Enterprises2 to \nhelp the Government (i) institute changes to corporate governance of public enterprises, (ii) \nimplement a financial performance monitoring framework, (iii) train directors and senior officials \non  requirements  of  the  Public  Enterprises  Act,  and  (iv)  build  the  capacity  of  the  Public \nEnterprise Unit to support the minister of finance in providing policy advice and in analyzing the \nperformance of enterprises. This was followed by a small-scale TA entitled Rationalization of \nPublic Enterprises, Phase II3 to assist with the privatization of the Sea Star Fishing Company, \nand to build the capacity of the Public Enterprise Division (PED) of the Ministry of Finance and \nEconomic Planning (MFEP) to manage the public enterprise portfolio. \n \n2.  In response to a Government request during the Country Consultation Mission of 28 \nFebruary\u20133 March 2006, ADB approved the inclusion of a TA entitled Rationalization of Public \nEnterprises, Phase III in its 2006 nonlending program in place of the proposed Implementation \nof Agriculture Sector Road Map. During the Country Consultation and TA Fact-Finding Mission \nthat  visited  Tonga  from  30  May  to  1  June  2006,  the  Government  and  ADB  reached \nunderstandings on the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing \narrangements, and terms of reference of this TA. The proposed TA is consistent with the \nstrategic objectives of the Pacific Strategy for the Asian Development Bank 2005\u20132009.4  The \nVice President (Operations 2) approved the concept paper for the TA on 7 July 2006. The TA \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The Government, with the assistance of ADB,6 approved its Strategic Development Plan \nEight  2006/07\u20132008/09  (SDP-8),  which  presents  the  development  vision,  the  medium-term \nnational development goals, and the strategies for developing these goals for the country. In \naccordance  with  the  SDP-8,  the  Government  reconfirmed  its  interest  in  focusing  ADB\u2019s \nassistance during  the 2007\u20132009  Country  Strategy  and  Program  Update7 under  a  second \nphase of the EPRSP. This would encompass, under the eight goals of the SDP-8, the following \nareas: (i) sustainable fiscal balance; (ii) efficiency in public service delivery; (iii) financial sector \ndevelopment,  including  support  for  enhancement  of  monetary  policy  instruments  and  the \nindependence of the National Reserve Bank of Tonga; (iv) private sector development with a \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002.

Manila. \n ", "2   \nfocus on building an enabling environment for expanding private sector participation in the \neconomy; and (v) mitigation of social impacts. In ADB\u2019s Country Partnership Strategy for 2007\u2013\n2009, the Government envisages a carefully designed private sector development program, \nsupporting optimization of resource productivity, as a core counterpart to the second phase of \nthe EPRSP. \n \n4.  Improving  corporate  governance  of  public  enterprises,  including  corporatizing  and \nprivatizing,  is  integral  component  of  the  economic  and  public  sector  reform.  Reducing \nGovernment expenditure through divestment, particularly raising revenue through asset sales \ncould contribute significantly to the fiscal adjustment. Therefore, SDP-8 establishes as Goal 1 \nthe need to \u201ccreate a better governance environment\u201d by \u201cstrengthening corporate governance \nin the public enterprise sector through enforcement of the Public Enterprises Act\u201d (Strategy 9), \nand \u201ccorporatizing selected Government commercial activities and privatizing selected public \nenterprises\u201d (Strategy 10). In addition, SDP-8 highlights the need to \u201cformulate and implement a \nplan for outsourcing Government  services that encompasses capacity building for contract \ndesign, contract management and internal audit\u201d (Strategy 4). To move decisively toward these \nobjectives,  the  Government  has  established  a  multi-ministry  Privatization  Task  Force\u2014\nsupported  by  MFEP\u2019s  PED\u2014that  is  responsible  for  reviewing  and  executing  divestiture \nopportunities for a long list of public enterprises, including (i) the Post Office, (ii) Talamahu \nMarket, (iii) the Tonga Chronicle, (iv) Fua\u2019motu Airport, (v) the Tapuhia Waste Management \nAuthority, (vi) the Leiola Duty Free, and (vii) the Tonga Investment Ltd. The 2005 Alternative \nService Delivery report8 identified additional privatization opportunities, including Tongatapu \nMachinery Pool, Tonga Timber, Tonga Print, and Tonga Corporation. In this connection, the \nGovernment requested TA from ADB to accelerate public enterprise rationalization, including \nprivatization processes. Such assistance is essential, given the specific, technical nature of the \nwork involved, and difficulties in recruiting qualified staff to fill MFEP vacancies.    \n \n5.  The TA for the first phase of the rationalization of public enterprises (footnote 2) was \ndesigned to prepare for a loan that would provide funds for an ongoing program of privatization \nand financial reconstruction of public enterprises. During the TA, ADB and the Government \nrecognized that a loan was not required as the Government was fully committed to the public \nenterprises reform program, and the budgeted resources and expected proceeds from the initial \nsales could cover the costs associated with rationalization and privatization. However, this is no \nlonger the case due to the tightened financial situation. Under Phase II, the Government had \nagreed to fund some services ancillary to those provided by ADB\u2019s consultants (e.g., auditing, \nasset valuation, etc.). However, the fiscal conditions have exacerbated further due to the recent \ncivil service strike outcome and the costs related to the recovery of the riots experienced by the \ncentral commercial district in Nuku\u2019Alofa in November 2006. Thus, under the current financial \nsituation, the Government would not be able to finance alone the preparation of the remaining, \nbut necessary, rationalizations. \n \n6.  The initial Rationalization of Public Enterprises TA identified the main elements needed \nto support a continuing reform program. However, it did not establish a rigid timetable to enable \nflexibility in acting on particular public enterprises. The final report provides a comprehensive \nreview of the public enterprise sector, the legislative framework, and Government management \nof its investment, as well as each enterprise and significant trading activity of Government. The \nTA also concluded that future external support should be targeted tightly, locally managed, and \naccompanied by skills transfer. To achieve good results consistently from public enterprise \n                                                 \n8  Pricewaterhouse Coopers. 2005.

These should be backed by more \nexpert commercial, financial, and legal advice that is available within the Government or the \nTongan private sector. On 30 August 2006, the Government provided the following list of public \nenterprises to be rationalized with the assistance of the proposed TA: (i) International Dateline \nHotel,  (ii)  Leiola  Duty  Free  Limited,  (iii)  Shipping  Cooperation  of  Polynesia,  (iv)  Tonga \nMachinery Pool, and (v) Tonga Timber. \n7.  To strengthen public sector capability to manage and monitor performance of the public \nenterprises, the TA will include skills transfer to local staff as a key objective and a target \noutcome that will be a deliverable in the consultants\u2019 contract. Additional capacity building is \nneeded to build upon the competencies developed under the first phase to harness within the \nGovernment  capacity  to  monitor  public  enterprise  governance  and  guide  performance \nimprovement,  including  development  of  private-public  partnership  arrangements  and \nprivatization processes.  \n \n8.  Strengthening the management of public enterprises that will remain majority-owned by \nthe  Government  in  the  short-  and  medium-term  is  another  important  area  that  requires \nassistance, as well as provision of advice for public enterprise performance improvement. To \nimprove accountability and transparency of public enterprise operations, MFEP will continue to \nrequire that public enterprises formulate statements of corporate intent and meet their reporting \nobligations under the Public Enterprise Act. Further, MFEP will work with the relevant line \nministries to clarify public enterprises\u2019 community service obligations, and to provide for more \ntransparent financing of these obligations.  \n9.  The TA will support the Government\u2019s goals and strategies established in the SDP-8 as \na crucial instrument for advancing economic and public sector reforms. The proposed TA for \nRationalization  of  Public  Enterprises,  Phase  III,  continues  the  progress  developed  under \nprevious  ADB-funded  TAs  and  is  aimed  at  rationalizing  the  performance  of  the  public \nenterprises by providing expert skills for an application of options to improve the performance of \nthe public enterprise portfolio, including through outsourcing, performance-based contracting, \nconcessions, as well as the preferred option of disengagement from public enterprises through \nprivatization.    \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The overall impact of the TA is to reduce fiscal expenditure pressure by off-loading the \nGovernment\u2019s responsibilities for selected public enterprises. It also will develop alternative, \nprivate sector-driven modalities for service provision. The TA is in line with ADB\u2019s strategy for \nTonga that focuses on economic governance and improvement of fiscal conditions among its \nbroader macroeconomic management objectives. The TA will help Government execute the \npublic enterprise reforms envisaged under the Public Enterprise Act 2002, detailed in the final \nreport of the Phase I and partly implemented under the Phase II. \n \n11.  The expected outcome is improved fiscal governance through rationalization of public \nenterprise portfolio, particularly in terms of reducing fiscal burden resulting from ailing public \nenterprises,  realizing  revenues  through  disengagement  from  public  assets,  and  expanding \nprivate  investment  to  fuel  private  sector-led  economic  growth.  The  TA  will  assist  the \nPrivatization Task Force and PED with the rationalization process for selected public enterprises. \nThe public enterprise reforms will (i) strengthen the Government\u2019s overall financial position; (ii) \n ", "4   \nincrease the operational and financial autonomy for public enterprise management, thereby \nimproving the performance of public enterprises; and (iii) build the capacity of civil service staff \ninvolved in public enterprise oversight.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will assist the Government with the rationalization of selected public enterprises \nthat the Privatization Task Force is conducting under the direction of MFEP with the support of \nPED.  Specifically,  the  TA  will  (i)  determine  the  rationalization  strategy  for  each  selected \ncompany; (ii) assist PED in the implementation of the strategy adopted for each company, \nbased on the feedback of the steering committee, by providing detailed technical, financial, and \nregulatory advice; (iii) provide extensive technical support for the due diligence process based \non the option taken; (iv) support the valuation process in the case of privatization; (v) prepare a \nrationalization  plan  for  each selected  enterprise;  (vi)  assist  with  the  implementation  of  the \nrationalization  plans;  and  (vii)  provide  capacity  building  for  the  relevant  Government \ndepartments. \n \n13.  The lead international consultant under the TA will be based in Tonga on an interim \nbasis  to  support  with  the  rationalization  of  public  enterprises.  Skills  transfer  and  capacity \nbuilding for local PED staff in technical, management, and regulatory areas will be strongly \nemphasized. Other international and national consultants will be used for short-term specialist \nadvice, as appropriate. The lead consultant, assisted by short-term consultants, also will provide \ntraining and support to staff in other ministries responsible for oversight of public enterprises \nthat will remain majority-owned by the Government in the short and medium term.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost the equivalent of $500,000. The Government has asked \nADB  to  finance  $400,000  through  a  grant  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the \nGovernment  of  Japan.  The  Government  will  provide  the  equivalent  of  $100,000  for  local \ncurrency costs in the form of office space, adequate counterpart staff, local transportation, \nworkshops, and seminars. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  MFEP will be the Executing Agency for the TA, with PED closely coordinating with other \ndepartments  that  support  the  respective  ministries  in  supervising  and  monitoring  the \nperformance of public enterprises. The Privatization Task Force will serve as the steering \ncommittee for the TA, coordinating its implementation. The steering committee also will provide \noverall policy guidance to the consultants, and ensure the quality of the deliverables. \n \n16.  An international consulting firm in association with national consultants will carry out the \nTA from February 2007 to May 2008. ADB will engage the consultants in accordance with its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006, as amended from time to time). The TA will \nrequire about 28 person-months of consulting services, comprising about 13 person-months of \ninternational consultants and about 15 person-months of national consultants, to carry out the \nactivities as defined in the terms of reference. The international consultants will have expertise \nin  public  enterprise  reform  (team  leader  consultant)  and  financial  analysis.  The  national \nconsultants will have expertise in financial analysis and law. Procurement under the TA will be \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April 2006, as amended from time to time), \nand equipment will be handed over to the Executing Agency upon completion of the TA. \n ", "  5\n17.  The team leader and the short-term consultants will work closely with the Government, \nparticularly with the minister of finance, and the staff of PED and other ministries responsible for \noversight of public enterprises. MFEP and other concerned ministries will ensure timely access \nto relevant information on public enterprises. During TA implementation, workshops will be \norganized with MFEP, PED, other Government agencies, ADB, the consultants, and other \nstakeholders.  Appropriate  training  sessions  will  be  organized  for  PED  officers  and  public \nenterprise management staff. \n \n18.  Throughout  the  TA,  the  consultants  will  submit  brief  monthly  progress  reports, \nsummarizing  TA  activities,  issues,  and  constraints.  In  addition,  four  major  reports  will  be \nsubmitted: (i) inception report, within 2 weeks of commencement of assignment; (ii) interim \nreport, 6 months after the commencement of the assignment; (iii) draft final report, 13 months \nafter  commencement  of  assignment;  and  (iv)  final  report.  The  Government  and  ADB  will \ncomment on the inception, interim, and draft final report. The final report will be submitted within \n3 weeks after the tripartite meeting has discussed the draft final report. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Tonga for the Rationalization of Public Enterprises, Phase III, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n \n \n ", " 6    Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact       \n \nImproved fiscal  Disengagement from public  Government statistics and  Political risk factors not affect \ngovernance releasing  enterprises  economic reports, e.g.,  investor confidence \nfiscal resources from    Quarterly Review of the \npublic enterprises     Reserve Bank of Tonga \n     \nIncreased private sector  Increased private sector   \ninvestment in service  share of GDP and of formal \nprovision  employment \nOutcome      Assumption \n \nImproved public sector  Improved rate of return on  MFEP and PED records  Government commitment to \ngovernance through the  the portfolio of public    economic and public sector \nrationalization of the  enterprises  MFEP and PED and  reforms can be maintained \npublic enterprise portfolio,    consultant reports  through the implementation \npreferably through  Reduced fiscal engagement    period of the SDP-8  \ndivestiture, but also  in public enterprise sector   ADB review missions   \nthrough private public     \npartnership options of  Increase in private sector   \nconcessions,  investment as share of GDP    \nperformance-based   \ncontracts, and outsourcing   \n \nOutputs      Assumption \n \nRationalization and/or  Rationalization through  MFEP and PED records  Market exists for divestment of \nprivatization of at least  appropriate public private    selected public enterprises. \nfour public enterprises  partnership arrangements  MFEP and PED and   \n  for service provision to  consultant reports  Risk \n  reduce fiscal expenditure to     \n  public enterprises,  ADB review missions \nPolitical instability not allowing \n  preferably through   \nthe rationalization processes to \n  privatization, concessions, \nprogress as planned \n  performance-based \n \n  contracting, and outsourcing \n   \n  Assets divested in under \n  transparent procedures and \n  competitive arrangements \n   \n  Continuity of and universal \n  access to public services, \n  and rationalization of social \n  service obligations, as \n  required, under divested or \n  contracted service provision \n   \nEnhanced technical,  At least five PED high- and \nmanagement, and  medium-level officers \nregulatory capacity in  properly trained, and with \nPublic Enterprise Division  capacity for handling \n(PED)  privatization and public \n  private partnership tender \nprocesses of public \nenterprises \n ", "Appendix 1  7\n \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs \n   \n1.
