INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  A draft paper on assessment of the transport sector in Tajikistan1 was prepared by the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) Tajikistan Resident Mission in coordination with the Ministry of \nTransport and Communications (MOTC) in 2006. The paper recommended preparation of a \ntransport sector master plan as a key government document guiding policies and investments in \nthe transport sector. Subsequently, the Government of Tajikistan (the Government) requested \ntechnical assistance (TA) from ADB for developing such a document. The TA concept paper \nwas approved by ADB Management on 12 July 2006 and endorsed by the Government during \nthe  Fact-Finding  Mission  on  21\u201326  August  2006.2  This  report  was  prepared  based  on \ndiscussions held and understanding reached with the Government on the TA\u2019s impact, outcome, \noutputs,  cost,  financing  and  implementation  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  As a landlocked and mountainous country, Tajikistan is highly dependent on transport \ninfrastructure for its development. However, its transport infrastructure, which was largely built in \nthe 1960\u20131980s as part of the integrated transport system under the former Soviet Union, \ndeteriorated rapidly in the early 1990s because of civil conflict, economic difficulties, and natural \ndisasters. More than 80% of the roads were in poor condition, and most of the rolling stock and \nair fleet were obsolete. Deteriorating transport infrastructure resulted in high transport costs, \nlong delivery times, traffic accidents, and limited access to markets and social services. As a \nresult, transport demand dropped sharply and the share of transport in gross domestic product \ndecreased from 5% in 1991 to 1% in 1998.3 While the economy has recovered since 1997, with \nan average annual growth rate of 10%, devastated transport infrastructure constitutes a major \nimpediment to sustainable growth. Transport infrastructure needs to be developed with new \ninvestments. The proposed transport sector master plan will identify the sector\u2019s investment \nneeds over the long term, which will pave the way for the development of an adequate and \nefficient transport network, connecting Tajikistan domestically and internationally. \n \n3.  Given the extent and condition of transport infrastructure in Tajikistan, its financing is \ninadequate.  Tajikistan  inherited  a  large  stock  of  transport  infrastructure  from  the  former \nSoviet Union,  and  maintaining  them  properly  with  limited  resources  is  a  challenge.  The \nGovernment has increased annual funding for road rehabilitation and maintenance by at least \n15% in recent years, as required under ADB\u2019s loans, but funding remains insufficient. The \nGovernment\u2019s fiscal constraints are the main cause, while inefficient allocation of available \nfunds contributes to the problem. As a result, only a fraction of the transport sector\u2019s needs are \nmet.  Finding  ways  to  generate  adequate  revenues  for  the  transport  sector  is  a  long-term \nchallenge, and prioritizing the sector\u2019s needs is key to improving its sustainability over the \nmedium term. The proposed transport sector master plan will identify the sector\u2019s development \npriorities, and recommend options for sustainable sector funding and its efficient allocation. \n \n4.  Despite strong economic growth and rapid progress on poverty reduction in recent \nyears,4 about 60% of the population in Tajikistan was living in poverty in 2004. Transport \ndevelopment can significantly contribute to poverty reduction by improving access to markets, \njobs, and basic social services for remote and isolated communities. As such, development of \n                                                 \n1  Tajikistan Resident Mission. 2006. Transport Sector Assessment and Future Directions.

Dushanbe.  \n4  Poverty in Tajikistan was reduced from 82% in 1999 to 60% in 2004.   \n ", "2   \ntransport  infrastructure  and  services  is  one  of  the  priorities  in  the  Government\u2019s  Poverty \nReduction Strategy Paper5 issued in September 2002. To implement the Poverty Reduction \nStrategy Paper, MOTC is keen to develop a transport sector master plan, which will pave the \nway for a transport sector road map.  \n \n5.  Tajikistan\u2019s transport system is integrated inefficiently. The country\u2019s transport network \ncomprises roads, railways, and civil aviation. However, there is lack of integrated planning, \ninvestments, and operation among the three modes of transport. The 33,000 kilometers (km) of \nthe road network, which carried about 60% of goods and 80% of passengers in 2006, are \nunevenly distributed over the country. The railways consist of around 860 km of mostly single-\ntrack lines located separately in the north and south parts of the country. The state air company, \nTojikiston, has a fleet of 95 aircrafts, half of which were manufactured in the 1970s\u20131980s. This \nhas  an  inevitable  effect  on  the  quality  and  cost  of  air  transport  services.  An  integrated \nmultimodal transport system is essential to reduce transport costs and foster trade and other \nbusiness activities. The proposed transport sector master plan will be developed based on an \nintegrated multimodal approach. This will lay the foundation for the development of well-linked \nmultimodal transport infrastructure, harmonized regulations and procedures, and multimodal \nlogistics networks.  \n \n6.  Despite some progress, there remains a large reform agenda in the transport sector. \nThe sector policy lacks strategic vision, and many regulations (e.g., vehicle axle load controls \nand road safety) have not been effectively implemented because of weak enforcement. Private \nsector participation in the transport sector is limited to road transport services. In civil aviation, \nthe Government is making efforts to restructure and privatize the state air company, Tojikiston. \nThe Government also plans to allow the private sector to bid for local road construction and \nmaintenance contracts. The proposed transport sector master plan will include an action plan on \npriority  sector  reforms,  including  the  development  of  sound  policies  and  regulations; \nencouragement of private sector participation in construction, operation, and maintenance; and \nimprovement of transport safety. \n \n7.  Institutional capacity and human resource constraints in Tajikistan limit the introduction \nof  best  practices  in  the  transport  sector,  including  planning,  management,  operation,  and \nmaintenance. The sector financial management capacity is weak, as international accounting \nand auditing procedures have yet to be followed. The sector is losing experienced managerial \nand technical resources because of low salaries and lack of incentives. A sound institutional and \nhuman resources development plan is essential to sustainable development in the transport \nsector. The proposed transport sector master plan will assess the current situation and include a \nviable plan for institutional capacity development, through both changes in the institutional \nenvironment and targeted training.  \n \n8.  Transport  sector  development  often  has  environmental,  social,  and  involuntary \nresettlement impacts, which need to be considered and integrated into the sector development \nprogram.  The  proposed  transport  master  plan  will  examine  these  issues  and  ensure  that \nadequate  provisions  for  safeguards  are  provided  to  minimize  potential  adverse  impacts  in \naccordance with international best practice. \n \n9.  A policy directive in the Government\u2019s Transport Sector Policy Statement6 requires the \ndevelopment of the transport sector to be based on market-oriented reforms and restructuring to \n                                                 \n5  The Government of Tajikistan. 2002.

The Government\u2019s strategy includes developing international road corridors \nto facilitate external trade and transit traffic, and establishing legal and regulatory frameworks to \nencourage private sector participation in transport. The TA is consistent with the Government\u2019s \nstrategy for the transport sector. \n \n10.  The TA supports ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for Tajikistan,7 which identifies the \ntransport sector as a strategic priority for ADB assistance. ADB assistance to the transport \nsector has focused on strengthening Tajikistan\u2019s connectivity with neighboring countries, with \nthree loans totaling $64.5 million for improvement of regional road corridors.8 ADB has also \nassisted in institutional reform and policy dialogue with the Government through covenants \nunder loans and attached advisory TAs.9 The TAs targeted (i) policy reforms in the road \nsubsector, (ii) road maintenance and financing, and (iii) institutional strengthening and capacity \nbuilding.  These  TAs,  together  with  assistance  provided  by  the  European  Bank  for \nReconstruction and Development (EBRD)10 and World Bank11 for the preparation of a civil \naviation strategy in Tajikistan, form a good basis for the development of the proposed transport \nsector master plan.  \n \n11.  Tajikistan is an active member of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation \n(CAREC) Program. As requested by the Fourth CAREC Ministerial Conference held in Bishkek \nin  November  2005,  a  CAREC  transport  sector  strategy  is  being  developed  with  ADB \nassistance,12 which will reflect new trade realities and lead to sharp reductions in the time and \ncosts of moving goods to internal and external markets. The proposed transport sector master \nplan will be developed in collaboration with the CAREC regional transport sector strategy. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact of the TA will contribute to effective and efficient transport sector operations \nin Tajikistan, in support of sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction in the country, \nand regional connectivity. The outcome of the TA is the identification of long-term strategic \npriorities, reform, investments, and required resources for the transport sector, in line with the \ncountry\u2019s development strategy. The impact and outcome of the TA will be achieved through the \nrealization of the TA outputs\u2014the development of a transport sector master plan for 2008-2025. \nThe transport sector master plan will serve as a key government document guiding policies and \ninvestments in the transport sector. \n \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2003.

For the TA outcome and outputs to be fully achieved consultations with stakeholders and \npolicy dialogue with the Government should be held during implementation of the TA. The TA \nwill be implemented in two phases. Under phase I, the overall performance of the transport \nsector  will  be  assessed  in  detail.  The  assessment  will  cover  (i)  existing  sector  policies, \nregulations,  and  institutional  structures;  (ii)  technical  and  operational  effectiveness;  and \n(iii) financial efficiency. The sector\u2019s strengths and weaknesses will be identified, a detailed \nasset inventory prepared for road and railway subsectors, and their performance evaluated, \ngiven the current needs of the country. Traffic projections will be prepared to assess future \ninvestment needs. The capacity of government agencies and private entities in the transport \nsector will be assessed. For the civil aviation subsector, the assessment will be based on the \nreview of earlier studies undertaken by EBRD and the World Bank. Upon completion of phase I, \nADB and MOTC will organize a tripartite meeting to review the phase I outputs and agree on \nfurther steps under phase II. \n \n14.  Based on the results of the assessment under phase I, phase II will prepare a long-term \ntransport sector master plan, in line with the Government\u2019s Transport Sector Policy Statement. \nThe  transport  sector  master  plan  will  serve  as  a  framework  for  assessing  the  investment \nprogram, and will adopt an integrated multimodal approach to identify sector priorities. The \npriorities will be based on the impact of the transport sector on the economy over the projected \nperiod. Each of the subsectors will be prioritized according to their importance to the national \neconomy and poverty reduction in Tajikistan, as well as regional connectivity. Priority directions \nfor each subsector will be identified to improve policy and regulations, increase outputs and \nefficiency, and sustain the development process.  \n \n15.  Key TA activities will include desk studies; field surveys; data analyses; dialogue with \ngovernment  officials;  and  consultations  with  stakeholders  including  the  private  sector,  civil \nsociety, transport users, local communities, and external aid agencies. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $740,000 equivalent. The Government has \nrequested ADB to provide $600,000 equivalent to cover the most of the TA cost. The TA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The \nGovernment will finance $140,000 equivalent in kind by providing office space and facilities, \ncounterpart staff, and support services. The detailed cost estimates and a financing plan for the \nTA are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  \u041c\u041e\u0422C will be the Executing Agency and will be responsible for implementing the TA. \nMOTC will appoint a TA coordinator to supervise TA activities; resolve any issues that may arise \nduring implementation; and facilitate coordination among the consultants, government agencies, \nand other stakeholders. The existing project implementation unit for ADB-financed road projects \nwill  be  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  implementation  activities,  including  liaison  and \ncoordination  with  other  government  agencies  concerned.  To  ensure  the  Government\u2019s \nownership of the TA, a project steering committee will be set up to guide TA implementation and \nreview TA outputs. The project steering committee will be chaired by the minister of transport, \nand will comprise representatives of key relevant government agencies including the Ministry of \nEconomy and Trade, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of State Revenues and Duties, MOTC, and \n ", "  5\nOffice of the President\u2019s Administration. Tripartite meetings and workshops will be held to \ndiscuss, refine, and endorse the methodology and outputs of the TA.  \n \n18.  The TA will require about 18 person-months of international and 29 person-months of \nnational consulting services, to be provided by an international consulting firm in association of \nnational  consultants.  The  consultants  will  have  experience  and  expertise  in  the  fields  of \ntransport planning, economics, engineering, finance, and institutional development. The outline \nterms  of  reference  for  consultants  are  in  Appendix  3.  ADB  will  select  and  engage  the \nconsultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2006, as amended \nfrom time to time), using the quality and cost-based selection method and simplified technical \nproposals. Office equipment to be provided under the TA will be procured by the consultants in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2006, as amended from time to time) and will \nbe turned over to MOTC upon completion of the TA. The TA is expected to commence in June \n2007 and to be completed in January 2008. MOTC will provide the consultants with (i) an \nappropriately furnished office, (ii) relevant information and data to the TA, (iii) counterpart staff, \nand (iv) administrative support. The consultants\u2019 final report will be publicly disclosed through \nthe ADB website upon completion of the TA.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.

The international consultants will undertake the following \ntasks: \n \na.  Phase I. Sector assessment and projections: \n \n(i)  Review  macroeconomic  and/or  trade  data  and  analyze  transport  sector \nperformance in terms of freight and passenger transport volumes, access to \ntransport services, privatization or commercialization, safety, investments, and \nemployment, etc. \n(ii)  Review policy, regulatory, and institutional frameworks in the transport sector; \ntechnical  and  operational  effectiveness;  and  financial  efficiency.  Identify  the \nsector\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. \n(iii)  Review previous sector work by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other \nexternal  aid  agencies,  as  well  as  efforts  of  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and \nCommunications (MOTC). Use the lessons from these efforts to propose refined \nor new strategies and action plans to strengthen the sector framework or move to \na new framework.  \n(iv)  Review implementation progress of ADB TA on Strengthening Implementation of \nRoad Maintenance1 and make full use of its findings to build road component of \nthe study. Refine the road inventory data, if necessary, and determine the value \nof  road  assets.  Compare  the  assets  with  the  current  needs  in  the  national \neconomy.  \n(v)  Prepare a detailed inventory in railway and aviation subsectors, assess their \noperational conditions, and evaluate the performance in these subsectors, given \nthe current needs of the country.  \n(vi)  Prepare  transport  demand  projections  for  each  subsector  and  from  the \nperspective  of  multimodal  transport  operations.  The  projections  should  have \nscenarios with high, medium, and low expectations; and should cover a period of \nat least 25 years, depending on the generally accepted analysis period for each \nThe views expressusbesde hcetroeri.n O anre  tthheo sbea osfi st hoef  cthones purltoajnetc atinodn sd,o  dneotte nremcienses agrailpy sre ipnr ethseen ttr athnosspeo ortf  sAeDcBto\u2019sr  \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2007.

Use  simplified  transport  demand  modeling \ntechniques, if possible, and carry out necessary desk studies and field surveys. \n(vii)  Assess the capacity of the transport sector (including both government agencies \nand  private  entities)  in  terms  of  institutional,  technical,  human,  and  financial \nstrengths;  and  identify  areas  that  need  strengthening.  Prepare  plans  for \n(a) involving  university  graduates  in  the  industry,  educating  transport  sector \nprofessionals,  and  supporting  local  consulting  and  contracting  services,  and \nsustaining  them  within  the  industry;  (b)  strengthening  the  technical  base  of \nMOTC (applying information technology and other modernizing technologies); \n(c) undertaking policy and institutional reforms; and (d) strengthening financial \ncapability. \n \nb.  Phase II. Sector priorities and master plan \n \n(i)  Formulate a long-term strategic master plan that identifies policy directions for \nthe development of an integrated multimodal transport system in Tajikistan in line \nwith the Government\u2019s Transport Sector Policy Statement. The transport sector \nmaster plan will serve as a framework for assessing the investment program. \n(ii)  Assess the effect of each subsector on the national economy over the projected \nperiod, and identify and formulate priorities for developing the transport sector in \nTajikistan. Each of the subsectors should be prioritized on the basis of their \nimportance  to  the  national  economy;  development  objectives;  resource \nlimitations;  cumulative  effects  on  the  environment  (e.g.,  air  quality,  water \nresources,  ecology,  and  aesthetics);  and  contribution  to  poverty  reduction  in \nTajikistan. Priority directions should also be identified within each subsector to \nimprove  policy,  regulatory,  and  operational  efficiency  and  effectiveness;  and \nincrease output. These priorities need to be coordinated with the activities and \noutputs  of  the  ongoing  ADB\u2019s  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation \n(CAREC) regional transport sector strategy study to ensure that the national \npriorities are consistent with the regional transport priorities. Priority projects will \nthen be identified, through socioeconomic and environmental analyses of the \ncandidate  investment  projects,  for  implementation  under  an  integrated \nmultimodal transport approach. \n(iii)  Given the priorities identified and defined for the sector as a whole and for each \nof the subsectors, develop a comprehensive master plan for 2008\u20132025. The \nmaster  plan  will  comprise  (a)  effective  short-  (3\u20135  years)  and  long-term            \n(5\u201315 years)  development  plans  for  the  transport  sector;  and  (b)  an \nimplementation action plan for the short-term plan, including financial, human, \nand  technical  resources,  as  well  as  policy  reforms  and  priority  interventions \nneeded for the short-term period, and performance indicators and monitoring \nmechanisms. \n(iv)  Ensure ownership of MOTC and other stakeholders in developing the transport \nsector master plan through consultations, brainstorming sessions, workshops, \nand  seminars.  Make  every  effort  to  secure  understanding,  commitment,  and \nsupport from the Government for preparing the transport sector master plan \nthrough  dialogue  with  senior  officials  and  effective  presentations  of  the \nadvantages and benefits of such a master plan. \n \n ", "  Appendix 3  11 \n  2.
