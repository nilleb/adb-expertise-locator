THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof up to $300 million equivalent in US dollars and yuan comprising (i) an A loan of up to \n$150 million equivalent in US dollars and yuan, and (ii) a complementary loan of up to $150 \nmillion equivalent in US dollars and yuan to Beijing Capital Co., Ltd. (Beijing Capital) for the \nWestern Counties Water and Wastewater Management Project in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC).1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  Regional imbalances and a severe infrastructure divide between urban and rural areas \nare critical development challenges for the PRC. Less-developed regions of the country suffer \nfrom inadequate public infrastructure and access to basic services. For water in particular, \nremote and rural areas face large and growing needs for improved water supply and wastewater \nmanagement services to meet higher environmental standards. Funds provided through local \ngovernment financing  vehicles,  historically  the main  channels to finance  infrastructure,  are \ninsufficient for the magnitude of investments required. \n \n3.  The scale of unmet needs in the water supply and wastewater management sector, \nincreased  pollution  pressures,  the  associated  risks  of  waterborne  diseases,  and  increased \nattention to efficiency have become urgent priorities of the central government. 2 They are also, \nas in other sectors, encouraging new approaches to infrastructure concessions in the form of \npublic\u2013private  partnerships  (PPPs).  Traditionally,  local  governments  in  the  PRC  have \nundertaken public environmental service concessions by planning, tendering, and implementing \nprojects on a staggered or stand-alone basis. However, technical experts are coming to the \nview that an integrated economic approach to infrastructure management is required to foster \nstrong, sustainable, and balanced growth.3 Infrastructure investment strategies need to take into \naccount that infrastructure assets are interdependent and constitute a wider system; therefore, \nthe conventional project-centric approach adopted by many local governments may not deliver \nthe efficiencies crucial for their long-term sustainability. This awareness is reflected in the PRC\u2019s \nnew PPP guidelines and concession measures, in which multiple interlocking infrastructure \nservices can be tendered out, presenting an opportunity to raise the efficiency of infrastructure \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The central government is taking on this challenge by establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework and \ndevelopment plan for water and sanitation. In January 2011, the State Council\u2019s No. 1 Document set water \nresource management as the country\u2019s top priority that year. In 2013, the government\u2019s Resolution Concerning \nMajor Issues in Comprehensively Deepening Reform called for integrated urban and rural development, including a \ncomprehensive plan for urban and rural infrastructure construction and the equalization of basic public services in \nurban and rural areas. The Ministry of Environmental Protection has also published its Guideline on Project \nConstruction and Investment for Rural Sewage Treatment to encourage development in less-developed areas. \nTargets under the Twelfth Five-Year Plan (2011\u20132015) for National Urban Wastewater Treatment and Reuse \nInfrastructure Construction aim to increase the rate of wastewater treatment in smaller towns from 2010 levels of \nless than 20% to at least 30% by 2015. In 2015, the Action Plan for Water Pollution Control was announced, \nincluding a list of 10 measures to tackle water pollution, with the aim of improving the country\u2019s water environment \nquality and restoring the system function of water ecology by 2030. \n3  McKinsey Global Institute. 2013.

", "2 \ndesign, construction, operation, and maintenance through an optimized portfolio approach.4 \nExamples of such synergies include (i) the sizing of wastewater treatment capacity in step with \ntap water supply, (ii) cost efficiencies from coordinated operations, (iii) monitoring water quantity \nthroughout the value chain to detect any illegal wastewater discharge, and (iv) facilitating the \nreuse of treated wastewater as water supply for industrial users. \n \n4.  Through  continuous  screening  and  discussion  with  stakeholders  in  the  water  and \nsanitation  sectors,  the  team  identified  Beijing  Capital  as  a  strong  candidate  for  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  support.  Beijing  Capital  has  adopted  a  new  strategic  focus  on \nexpanding into less-developed markets, including counties in western regions of the PRC where \ninfrastructure for water treatment, distribution, wastewater collection and treatment systems \nremain  severely  underdeveloped. 5  Beijing  Capital  acknowledged  ADB\u2019s  strong  sector \nexperience  in  sovereign  and  nonsovereign  operations  and  requested  ADB  to  lead  the \narrangement of a US dollar\u2013yuan dual-currency financing package. \n \n2.  Project Design \n5.  The project is designed to optimize water and wastewater infrastructure portfolio in the \nwestern counties and townships in the PRC. The project involves the construction or acquisition, \nupgrade  and/or  expansion  of  water  and  wastewater  infrastructure  and  associated  facilities \nduring 2016\u20132018, and operation and maintenance thereafter on a concession basis. \n \n6.  Unit costs of delivering small-scale environmental infrastructure are significantly higher \nthan large-scale urban infrastructure. The project aims to minimize overall costs by adopting (i) \na comprehensive multisector approach, and (ii) cost-competitive technologies: \n \n(i)  Multisector  approach  to  select  an  efficient  combination  of  subprojects. \nThere are significant potential synergies in the planning, design, construction, \nand operation of water and wastewater management facilities. By supporting \nmultisector  concessions  where  available,  the  project  will  improve  resource \nefficiencies. \n(ii)  Cost-competitive  technologies.  Beijing  Capital  will  use  cost-competitive \nsolutions and adapt optimally to local conditions. In townships large enough for \nsewer  pipe  networks,  the  company  will  implement  centralized  collection  and \nwastewater treatment systems. For small towns and villages without sewage \nnetwork coverage, the company will implement distributed technology, such as \non-site modular units at capacities as small as 0.5 tons per day. \n \n7.  Beijing Capital will be responsible for identifying, selecting, negotiating, implementing, \nand operating the subprojects.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n                                                \n4  Regulations were revised in April 2015 to replace the previous concession templates (sector-specific documents \ntailored for water, wastewater, gas, district heating, and city transport) with a unified template applicable to all \nsectors.

", "3 \n \n3.  The Sponsor and the Borrower \n8.  The  project  sponsor  and  borrower,  Beijing  Capital,  is  a  leading  environmental \ninfrastructure provider in the PRC. It is listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, with 54.6% of its \nshares owned by Beijing Capital Group Co., Ltd., which is in turn wholly owned by the Beijing \nmunicipal government.6 \n \n9.  Beijing Capital\u2019s core business involves the investment and operation of water supply, \nwastewater treatment, solid waste management, and other environmental services. At end of \n2014, Beijing Capital had aggregate water supply capacity of 9.3 million tons/day, wastewater \ntreatment capacity of 6.3 million tons/day, and solid waste treatment capacity of 5,065 tons/day. \nIts water and solid waste treatment projects were spread over 49 cities of 17 provinces and \nserve a population of over 35 million. Beijing Capital differentiates itself from its peers by \nproviding, where applicable, one-stop integrated solutions across multiple infrastructure sectors. \nBy leveraging expertise in water supply and distribution, urban\u2013rural wastewater treatment, \nsewage network management, and solid waste management, Beijing Capital aims to improve \ninfrastructure efficiency. \n \n10.  Western counties and townships, areas where adequate water supply and wastewater \nmanagement services are lacking, are a new strategic focus of the company. Like its industry \npeers, Beijing Capital has historically focused on build-operate-transfer opportunities in large \ncities.  Beijing  Capital  is  undertaking  a  strategic  shift  to  pursue  business  potential  in  less-\ndeveloped towns and rural communities. The company has developed investment targets and \ntraining for this new growth area, and has signed strategic cooperation agreements with the \nlocal governments. To expand the scope of its service offerings to rural communities, Beijing \nCapital  in  2014  acquired  a  majority  stake  in  Capital  Greinworth  Environmental  Protection \nTechnology Co., Ltd. (CGEP), a leading manufacturer of modular, small-scale units for on-site \nwastewater treatment.7 CGEP\u2019s units are used in 3,400 villages across 22 provinces, providing \na strong platform for growth. \n \n11.  Beijing Capital has demonstrated steady financial performance. In 2014, it reported total \nassets of CNY25.2 billion, revenue of CNY5.6 billion, and net profit of CNY688.1 million.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Output \n12.  Impact.  The  impact  will  be  the  improved  access  to  and  efficiency  of  water  and \nwastewater management services in the western counties of the PRC.  \n \n13.  Outcome. The outcome will be the expansion and improvement in the provision of water \nsupply and wastewater management services in western counties of the PRC. \n \n                                                \n6  As Beijing Capital is a managerially independent, commercially oriented company engaged in market competition, \nprocurement will follow ADB\u2019s policies for nonsovereign operations. \n7  CGEP\u2019s technologies are based on Japan\u2019s Jokaso system and enhanced with (i) flexibility to adapt to small rural \ncommunities by having a product lineup ranging from 0.5 tons/day to 2,000 tons/day; (ii) remote monitoring system \nthat can oversee operations of hundreds of small-scale wastewater treatment stations on a real-time basis and be \naccessible through an internet browser or app; and (iii) automated operation that requires minimum on-site staff. \nThe technologies were awarded 37 patents by the State Intellectual Property Office. ", "4 \n14.  Output. The output will be the newly constructed and rehabilitated water supply and \nwastewater treatment facilities and associated infrastructure in target provinces of the PRC. By \n2019, 19 subprojects with a total water supply capacity of 500,000 tons/day and wastewater \ntreatment capacity of 540,000 tons/day will be developed. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n15.  Consistency with ADB strategy. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review \nof  Strategy  2020,   which  identifies  infrastructure  and  environment  as two  of  four  strategic \npriorities.8 On infrastructure, the project is in line with the strategy\u2019s focus on water supply and \nsanitation, as well as with its emphasis on PPP. On the environment, the project mitigates water \npollution and health threats, and promotes environmentally sustainable growth. \n \n16.  Consistency with country partnership strategy. By supporting inclusive growth and \nenvironmental sustainability, the project addresses two of the three development goals of ADB\u2019s \ncountry  partnership  strategy  for  the  PRC  and  aligns  with  its  sector  focus  on  environment \nprotection, water management, and pollution control.9 It strongly complements ADB\u2019s ongoing \ninitiatives  in  wastewater  treatment  and  water  pollution  control  in  urban  areas,  past  policy \nadvisory support for tariff reform,10 and recent advisory work on the sanitation needs of smaller \ncities and towns.11 \n \n17.  Consistency with water and urban operational plans. The project aligns with ADB\u2019s \nWater Policy, which recognizes the crucial importance of water to the rural poor, the critical \nimpacts of water scarcity, pollution, and degradation of watersheds, and the importance of \nefficient and sustainable water utility operation.12 ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020 \ncommits to investments of $2.0 billion\u2013$2.5 billion per year to 2020, and targets an additional \n$500 million per year for private sector lending.13 Integrated water and wastewater planning is \nconsistent with the operational plan\u2019s prioritization of efficiency gains as the central design \nfeature for ADB interventions. \n \nD.

", "5 \n \nTable 2: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory framework  Each subproject company will enter into concession agreements with municipal or county \ngovernments under build-operate-transfer or transfer-operate-transfer arrangements. Each \nsubproject will be implemented in accordance with granted approvals, and during \nconstruction and operation will be subject to government inspections on environment, \nsocial, and safety aspects. Influent and effluent will be metered with minimum offtake \nquantities in wastewater subprojects.  \nManagement  Beijing Capital will centralize subproject development, procurement, and financing \narrangements across its operations. Beijing Capital will second experienced general \nmanagers and chief financial officers to each subproject company. Cash will be centrally \nmanaged through its cash management system. \nTariffs  Each subproject will receive tariffs based on national guidelines for cost recovery and \nreasonable returns.15 \nImplementation period  January 2016\u2013December 2018 \nConstruction  Each subproject company will enter into engineering, procurement, and construction \narrangement  contracts with subcontractors. The small-scale distributed wastewater treatment application \nwill be sourced by Capital Greinworth Environmental Protection Technology Co., Ltd. Other \ngoods and services will be procured from Asian Development Bank member countries in a \ntransparent manner through competitive bidding procedures.  \nOperation arrangements \nRevenue structure  Each plant will be paid water and wastewater treatment fees by end-users through local \ngovernments based on volume.  [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \nMajor cost structure  Major costs comprise electricity, chemicals, labor, and administrative and maintenance \nexpenses.  \nOperation and  Operation and maintenance will be handled by each subproject company\u2019s staff, who may \nmaintenance  be transferred from Beijing Capital, its existing projects, and/or recruited externally. Beijing \nCapital has experienced teams to recruit, train, and manage new staff. \nPerformance  Beijing Capital will report on key performance indicators, including the output and outcome \nmonitoring  indicators identified in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Beijing Capital Co., Ltd. \n \nF.  Projected Financial and Economic Performance \n19.  The  project  is  financially  viable  because  each  of  Beijing  Capital\u2019s  subprojects  is \nundertaken with a minimum financial internal rate of return threshold higher than the weighted \naverage cost of capital. The project is economically sustainable as the economic return on \ninvested capital is higher than the social discount rate of 12%. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n20.  ADB\u2019s  proposed  assistance  to  Beijing  Capital  consists  of  (i)  an  A  loan  of  up  to \n$150 million equivalent in US dollars and yuan, and (ii) a complementary loan of up to $150 \nmillion equivalent in US dollars and yuan. ADB will fund the A loan from its ordinary capital \nresources and the complementary loan from participating banks with ADB acting as lender of \nrecord. The A loan will have a maturity of up to 10 years from the date of the first disbursement. \n                                                \n15The  tariff  framework  benefitted  from  ADB  policy  advisory  on  economically  sustainable  tariff  design  and \nimplementation.

", "6 \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n21.  Justification for ADB involvement in the project is based on the following: \n(i)  Compared  with  more  developed  regions,  the  PRC\u2019s  western  counties  and \ntownships are disadvantaged in attracting private capital to municipal service \nconcessions  such  as  water  supply  and  wastewater  treatment  services.  ADB \nsupport will increase private investment and commercial bank lending to regions \nthat are lagging behind. \n(ii)  ADB assistance is crucial to demonstrate the commercial viability and efficiency \nof multisector service concessions with facilities across a range of sizes\u2014a new \nmodel emerging in the PRC. ADB support is expected to highlight this untapped \npotential and build confidence in private sector participation for new forms of \nPPPs. \n(iii)  ADB  assistance  will  encourage  Beijing  Capital  to  improve  environmental \nconditions in rural areas with small-sized, modular, high-standard wastewater \ntreatment facilities. In so doing, the project will improve living standards in rural \nareas, and contribute to a more balanced urban and rural development. \n(iv)  ADB assistance will lower transaction costs by bundling multiple infrastructure \nsubprojects,  which  are  often  too  small  and  time-consuming  for  international \ncommercial banks to finance on a stand-alone basis. ADB will link the cluster of \nsubprojects with the international financing community by arranging syndication \nand providing in-depth technical and safeguard due diligence. \n \nC.  Risks \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n22.  Regulatory risk. The PRC\u2019s policies governing water and wastewater treatment are \nsupportive. The government has also set clear goals to improve water quality and reduce \npollution. However, the PRC\u2019s regulatory framework is evolving with risks of delays in  the \napproval of tariff increases. \n \n23.  Offtake counterparty risk. In the case of water supply, fees are reliably collected from \nend-users since national policies require each end-use customer to be metered, and allow \ncurtailment of supply in the event of nonpayment. In the case of wastewater treatment, fees are \npublicly announced, largely sourced through treatment fees collected from end-users together \nwith  tap  water  fees,  and  further  backstopped  by  host  governments  under  concession \nobligations.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n24.  Completion  and  operation  risk.  Beijing  Capital  has  a  proven  track  record  in \nconstruction, operation, and maintenance across a wide range of facility types. Completion and \noperations risk are mitigated by the standardized, homogeneous nature of the subprojects. The \ncapacity of Beijing Capital\u2019s technical and operational teams was confirmed by ADB\u2019s technical \nadvisor during due diligence. \n ", "7 \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n25.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \ncategory  B  for  environment,  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  category  C  for \nindigenous peoples. The potential environmental and social impacts of the project have been \nidentified and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse \nimpacts are incorporated in the safeguard reports and plans. Beijing Capital has committed to \nenhance its institutional capacity to adequately manage the project\u2019s social and environmental \nimpacts. ADB\u2019s due diligence involved an audit of Beijing Capital\u2019s existing environmental and \nsocial management system (ESMS) and its past and current performance against the PRC\u2019s \nlaws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The institutional capacity and \ncommitment  of  Beijing  Capital  to  meet  the  PRC\u2019s  social  and  environmental  safeguard \nrequirements  are  deemed  adequate.  Beijing  Capital  will  update  its  ESMS  to  include  an \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  implementation  system  to  meet  ADB\u2019s  safeguard \nrequirements prior to the first disbursement. The updated ESMS will ensure Beijing Capital\u2019s \ncapacity to conduct future subprojects in line with  ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and \ninclude  detailed  subproject  selection  procedure  and  criteria.16 The  management  of  Beijing \nCapital has committed to allocate sufficient human resources and budget to implement the \nupdated ESMS. \n \n26.  The potential environmental impacts will be reversible and are not unprecedented.17 The \nimpacts associated with the construction of sewage and water supply network are mainly noise \nand vibration during excavation works. Traffic congestions and nuisance to communities from \nroad works are manageable as the subprojects are located in small towns. Potential impacts \nduring operation for wastewater treatment include effluent quality, sludge management, noise, \nodor, and possible generation of toxic gases. Potential impacts  during operation for water \nsupply facility include over extraction of water resources, delivery of unsafe water caused by \nraw  water  pollution,  and  adverse  impacts  associated  with  the  use  of  chlorine  and  other \nchemicals. Subprojects with impacts associated with raw water supply and sludge management \nwill be avoided in the subproject selection process. Other impacts can be mitigated through the \nadoption of good engineering practices. \n \n27.  Subprojects will be screened and categorized according to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement. The updated ESMS will include detailed screening procedures and criteria. ADB will \nnot  finance  any  category  A  subprojects.  Initial  environmental  examinations  including \nenvironment  management  plans  will  be  prepared  for  ADB-funded  category  B  subprojects. \nBeijing Capital will carry out audits for existing facilities that will be acquired with funding from \nADB; a corrective action plan (CAP) will be developed before the start of operations. The initial \nenvironmental examinations and audit reports with CAP will be disclosed according to ADB\u2019s \nsafeguard requirements.18 The ESMS will cover Beijing Capital\u2019s other activities such as the \nmanufacturing and installation of decentralized wastewater treatment modules for communities. \n \n                                                \n16 The selection criteria include ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list. \n17 Beijing Capital will exclude potential category A subprojects with significant environmental adverse impacts. \n18 Each subproject company will implement environmental management plans and CAPs.

The audit finds that land acquisition is expected to be in the vicinity of urban  and \nnonresidential areas, which will avoid any physical displacement in the buffer zone around water \nand  wastewater  treatment  plants.  Land  acquisition,  compensation,  resettlement,  and \nrehabilitation are not expected to be significant and, if needed, are normally carried out by local \ngovernment agencies. Beijing Capital\u2019s updated ESMS will include resettlement principles and \nprocedures to ensure that ADB-funded subprojects are rigorously examined with regard to land \nacquisition and resettlement impacts. Should subprojects have involuntary resettlement impacts \nentailing  physical  and  economic  displacement,  resettlement  plans  will  be  prepared  and \nimplemented by local governments prior to any construction activities in accordance with PRC \nlaws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The audit also finds that the \nproject is not expected to have any impacts on ethnic minorities. The ESMS will include social \nsafeguard screening procedures to ensure there are no adverse impacts on ethnic minorities. \n \n29.  Other social dimensions. The project is categorized as no gender elements, however \nBeijing Capital will undertake gender analysis as part of the environmental and social impact \nassessment for each subproject; and involve women in consultation, awareness campaigns and \nhiring.  Beijing  Capital  upholds  gender  equality  and  provides  equal  benefits  and  training \nopportunities for both men and women. Priorities are provided to women for positions in the \nfinancial and human resource department, and in laboratories. Beijing Capital is committed to \nundertake  measures  to  (i)  support  engagement  of  women  in  construction  activities  by  its \ncontractors; and (ii) regularly ascertain concerns of residents, including women, through the \nconsultations with resident welfare associations. Beijing Capital will comply with national labor \nlaws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy (2001), will take measures to comply \nwith the internationally recognized core labor standards.19 The borrower will report regularly to \nADB on (i) its (and its contractors\u2019) compliance with such laws, and (ii) the measures taken. \nInformation disclosure and consultation with affected people will be conducted in accordance \nwith ADB requirements.20 \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n30.  Beijing Capital was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice \nrelating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will \nensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, \nmoney  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  remedies  for  ADB  in  the  event  of \nnoncompliance. \n \nC.
