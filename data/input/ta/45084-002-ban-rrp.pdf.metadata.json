I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) proposed administration of a loan  and a grant to be provided by the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  Strategic  Climate  Fund  (SCF),1 all  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nBangladesh for the Coastal Climate-Resilient Infrastructure Project.2 \n \n2.  The  project,  while  enhancing  the  longevity  and  sustainability  of  infrastructure,  will \nimprove livelihoods in 12 rural coastal districts of Bangladesh3 vulnerable to climate variability \nand change.4  \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The  project  is  included  in  the  Government  of  Bangladesh\u2019s  Strategic  Program  for \nClimate Resilience which was prepared under the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience to pilot \ntest  and  demonstrate ways  to mainstream  climate  resilience  in  development  planning  and \nmanagement.5 Within the framework of the government\u2019s program, the project will enhance \nclimate resilience in the rural coastal areas. The project will integrate climate change adaptation \nand disaster risk reduction into policy formulation and infrastructure development.  \n4.  Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate variability and change \nbecause of its geographic location, low deltaic floodplain, hydro-meteorological influence of erratic \nmonsoon rainfall, and other extreme climate events. Climate change threatens the significant \nachievements made by Bangladesh since 1990 in raising incomes and reducing poverty. By \n2050, climate change impact could make an additional 14% of the country extremely vulnerable \nto flooding and dislocate more than 35 million people in coastal districts. About 87% of roads in \nthe country will be substantially inundated as a result of climate change by 2050.6 The low-lying \ncoastal zone of the country is highly vulnerable both to the normal tidally enhanced monsoon \nfloods  and  to  regular  impact  from  tropical  cyclones.  About  58  tropical  cyclones  impacted \nBangladesh during 1960\u20132010, with severe effect on coastal areas. Salinity intrusion and an \nincrease in salinity resulting from climate change are affecting agricultural productivity and \nlivelihood in coastal areas.  \n  \n5.  In  Bangladesh,  climate  change  will  aggravate  storm-surge-related  inundation.7 The \nsurges will be elevated by a rising sea level as thermal expansion occurs and ice caps continue \nto melt. A warmer ocean is likely to intensify cyclone activity and thus heighten storm surges. \nThe  destructive  impact  of  storm  surges  will  generally  be  greater  when  the  surges  are \naccompanied by strong winds and large onshore waves. Larger storm surges threaten greater \nfuture destruction because they will increase the depth of inundation and will move farther \n                                                \n1  Under the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience financed by the Strategic Climate Fund. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  These districts are Bagerhat, Barguna, Barisal, Bhola, Gopalganj, Jhalokati, Khulna, Madaripur, Patuakhali, \nPerojpur, Satkhira, and Shariatpur.  \n4  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance.

", "2 \ninland\u2014threatening larger areas than in the past. Bangladesh\u2019s vulnerability may increase even \nmore  as  evidence  points  toward  a  probable  increase  in  the  frequency  of  intense  tropical \ncyclones in the Bay of Bengal.  \n \n6.  The predicted climate changes will increase the current infrastructure vulnerability as a \nresult of sea level rise, increased wet season rainfall, increased annual temperatures, and \nincreased frequency of severe cyclones. Recent predictions derived from Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change modeling,8 based on minimum and maximum emission scenarios, \nshow temperatures rising by 1.9\u00b0C\u20132.4\u00b0C and wet season rainfall increasing by 9%\u201310%.9 The \nincrease in temperature has the potential to cause material expansion, resulting in damage to \nconcrete structures such as buildings, bridges, and culverts. Bitumen seals to roads may be \nsusceptible to softening unless higher temperature resistant bitumens are used. Floods resulting \nfrom  increased  rainfall,  cyclones,  and  storm  surges  have  the  potential  to  damage  road \nembankments, markets, and housing. Increasingly severe storm events will also increase the \npotential flood-related damage as well as cause additional erosion damage from the over-\ntopping of road embankments. High winds associated with storm events have the potential to \ndamage buildings, as well as cause secondary damage from trees and other debris. Wind-\ndriven wave action can have a significant erosive effect on exposed road embankments and \nbridge  abutments.  The  culmination  of  these  impacts  will  be  a  rapid  deterioration  of  rural \ninfrastructure. \n \n7.  Predictions  of  the  yearly  relative  sea  level  rise  for  coastal  Bangladesh  range  from \n1.5 millimeters (mm)/year to 10 mm/year, with a recent estimate of 7 mm/year being adopted by \nthe World Bank (footnote 7). A general relative sea level rise of 7 mm/year has been taken for \nassessment of typical subprojects in the project. The effective sea level rise is a combination of \nrelative  sea  level  rise  and  land  subsidence.  The  land  subsidence  has  been  estimated  at \n2 mm/year\u20134 mm/year within the project region. For typical subproject assessment, an average \nland subsidence rate of 3 mm/year has been adopted. The adopted figures for a 20-year road \ndesign life are 140 mm of relative sea level rise, plus 60 mm of subsidence, giving a total \neffective sea level rise of 200 mm. This 200 mm, with the standard 600 mm freeboard figure \n(minimum road pavement crest level above the normal annual flood level), forms the basis for \nthe target levels for each road surface within the project. The cost of upgrading of roads and \nmarket to future climate change standard is 30%\u201340% higher than current practices.10 \n \n8.  Poverty is extensive in the country and more so in rural areas. Although declining, the \nnational poverty rate is still 31.5%.11 Within the project rural areas, poverty incidence is 35%\u2013\n39%, which is higher than the national average. The achievement in poverty reduction can be \npartly attributed to improved rural infrastructure, including roads and markets. The overall traffic \nvolume has been growing at 10.5% a year, faster than the growth in gross domestic product of \nover 6%. Improved roads provide more comfortable travel, lower transport costs, and significant \nsavings in vehicle operating costs. With further upgrading of the country\u2019s road network, the \ndemand for road transport will continue to rise. However, there is an increasing risk that climate \n                                                \n8  S. Solomon, D. Qin, M. Manning, Z. Chen, M. Marquis, K.B. Averyt, M. Tignor, and H.L.

The  road  network  in  coastal  districts  covered  by  the  project,  under  present  climate \nconditions, is seriously damaged during extreme climatic events. The maintenance and damage \nrepair requirements of such roads will increase with climate change. For many road sections, the \ncross-drainage systems are inadequate, with poorly maintained canals and drains not having \nenough  hydraulic  capacities  to  discharge  flows  efficiently  to  sluice-gated  outlets  through \nembankments. This causes substantial waterlogging of adjacent land, adversely affecting land \nuse; this will worsen with climate change. For rural markets, maintenance and damage repair \nrequirements, with spoilage and wastage of perishable goods, will also rise with climate change. \nAs demonstrated by recent cyclone events, the capacities of cyclone shelters and livestock refuge \nfacilities are insufficient. Many existing cyclone shelters also have vulnerable access roads and \npower supplies and inadequate water supply and sanitation facilities, which often are not usable \nduring emergency conditions.   \n \n10.  Farmers,  especially  poor  and  small-scale  farmers,  suffer  from  a  wide  range  of \nconstraints that limit their livelihoods. Lack of all-weather road connectivity limits their access to \nmarkets,  increases  the  cost  of  production  because  of  higher  transportation  costs,  lowers \ncommodity prices owing to remoteness, and hinders access to education and health services. \nPoor  road  connectivity  also  restricts  their  access  to  financial  services,  technology,  and \ndevelopment support services provided by various agencies. During extreme climatic events, \nthe poor lose their assets as well as livelihood options. Often after extreme conditions, men tend \nto  migrate,  leaving  their  families  behind.  Poverty  incidence  is  widespread,  with  many \nhouseholds headed by women. The women are more vulnerable because of (i) poorer access to \neducation and health services, and economic opportunities; (ii) limited mobility; and (iii) various \nsocial restraints. \n \n11.  The development strategy of Bangladesh is linked to upgrading rural infrastructure, with \na  focus  on  road  connectivity.  The  country\u2019s  Sixth  Five-Year  Plan  for  FY2011\u2013FY2015 \nunderscores  the  importance  of  rural  infrastructure,  climate  resilience,  and  adaptation \nmeasures.12 ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Bangladesh, 2011\u20132015 emphasizes the \nneed for  integration  of climate  change  consideration  into  sector  interventions  and  climate-\nproofing infrastructure.13 The project is also aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, which advocates \nrural infrastructure development and climate-proofing.14 The project will address many lessons \nfrom implementing past and ongoing rural infrastructure projects in Bangladesh supported by \nADB and development partners, including the International Fund for Agricultural Development \n(IFAD)  and  German  development  cooperation  through  KfW.  These  include  undertaking \nsustainable operation and maintenance, climate-proofing of infrastructure, robust and effective \nquality control arrangements, and sharpening focus on capacity development.   \n  \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact will be improved livelihoods in rural coastal districts vulnerable to climate \nchange. The outcome will be enhanced climate resilience of coastal infrastructure in 12 rural \ncoastal districts, benefiting the poor and women.  \n                                                \n12  Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission, Ministry of Planning. 2011.

The  outcome  will  be  achieved  through  the  following  outputs:  (i)  improved  road \nconnectivity,  (ii)  improved  market  services,  and  (iii)  enhanced  climate  change  adaptation \ncapacity.    \n1.   Output 1: Improved Road Connectivity  \n14.  Upgrading roads, culverts, and bridges. The project will upgrade 130 kilometers (km) \nof upazila (subdistrict) roads, including 780 meters of bridges and culverts. Complementary to \nthis output, IFAD will provide parallel financing to upgrade 174 km of union roads, and 233 km \nof village roads including 2,270 meters of bridges and culverts. Together, these interventions \nare  aimed  at  providing  year-round  connectivity  between  agricultural  production  areas  and \nmarkets and to other parts of the country. Road upgrading will involve improving existing roads \nto climate-resilient standards and widening and rising of embankments, with suitable slope \nprotection  against  erosion  and  wave  action.  The  underpinning  thrust  will  be  on  adequate \nearthworks, proper pavements, and cross drainage construction. The road crest level will be \n800 mm above the normal annual flood level, with an extra height of 200 mm that will be added \nfor the effective sea level rise to the standard 600 mm freeboard. The embankment protection \nwill mainly involve a combination of turf and shrubs, geotechnical measures where there is a \nhigh risk of active erosion, and increased cross drainage.  \n \n15.  Sustainability  of  upgraded  roads.  Sustainability  of  the  improved  roads  will  be \naddressed  by  climate-resilient  design,  application  of  effective  quality  assurance  during \nconstruction, allocating the road maintenance planning and supervision to a suitable person in \neach district, and preparing road maintenance plans. Women belonging to labor contracting \nsocieties will be engaged to clean out drainage canals, plant trees on roadsides and proper \nvegetation on embankments, and undertake routine road maintenance works.15 Road safety \nmeasures such as road signs, delineators and bollards near the approach to bridges and \nreflectors  carved  in  tree  trunks,  and  provision  of  loading  and  unloading  zones  will  be \nincorporated within the road designs. A road safety campaign for vulnerable users will also be a \npart of project road safety activities.  \n \n2.  Output 2: Improved Market Services  \n16.  Upgraded growth centers and large markets. The project will upgrade 88 growth \ncenters  and  large  markets,  with  15%  of  space  allocated  to  women.  Each  market  will  be \nconnected to an existing paved road or to one of those to be improved under the project. \nInfrastructure improvements include paved trading areas, sheds, water supply system, drainage \nfacilities,  sanitation  facilities,  and  market  offices.  At  each  market,  a  market  management \ncommittee comprising representatives of shop owners will be responsible for planning, and \noperation and maintenance of markets. In selected large markets, mini water supply, deep \nhand-operated tube wells, and sweet water ponds with pond sand filters where groundwater \nquality is problematic will be installed. In three growth center markets, shops owned by women, \ntoilets, and street lighting will be supplied with electricity using solar photovoltaic cells.16 The \nbeneficiaries will be trained in the judicious use and maintenance of the system, and the \n                                                \n15  Labor contracting societies comprise poor women with limited income-earning capabilities who carry out routine \nmaintenance on rural roads using basic hand tools and materials supplied by the Local Government Engineering \nDepartment (LGED). \n16 Selection criteria for these markets include no existing or near-future plan for Rural Electrification Board power \nsupply, acceptable and viable arrangements for operation and maintenance, and equitable geographic distribution. \n ", "5 \nbeneficiaries will bear the responsibility for maintaining the system via maintenance charges. \nSome key elements within growth centers or large markets such as new market sheds will be \nmade climate-resilient. These will be raised on concrete plinths to a level above the existing \nmaximum normal monsoon high-tide level plus the effective maximum sea level rise, with an \nadditional 250 mm freeboard. The central market area to be paved will be at maximum sea level \nrise plus 100 mm freeboard, with adequate drainage capacity included in the designs. Access to \nthe market will be above normal flood level.  \n  \n17.  Upgraded village markets and collection points. Complementary to this output, IFAD \nwill provide parallel financing to upgrade 186 community markets, add 11 women\u2019s market \nsections in existing community markets, and build 37 boat landing ghats (platforms) to climate \nchange standards. The market improvements will include a common shed, fish shed, open \npaved/raised area, women\u2019s section, toilet block and internal drainage, and building commodity \ncollection points. Labor contracting society members and market management committees will \nbe trained to foster community market development.  \n \n3.  Output 3: Enhanced Climate Change Adaptation Capacity    \n18.  Upgraded climate disaster shelters. KfW will provide parallel financing to construct or \nextend 15 multipurpose cyclone shelters, improve 10 existing cyclone shelters, upgrade 15 km \nof cyclone shelter access tracks, and construct five killas (animal shelters). The designs will take \ninto account climate change effects and strict compliance to building codes with respect to wind \nloading and floor bearing capacities. Emphasis will be on ensuring adequate water storage and \nsustainable power supply and appropriate toilet facilities, which can be used during extreme \nclimatic events. Access roads/tracks will be upgraded to the equivalent of village road climate \nresilience standard.  \n \n19.  Enhanced knowledge management. A framework for expanding institutional learning \nand knowledge sharing will be developed. This will entail more effective knowledge capture, \ncompilation, storage, and sharing on climate resilience principles for the design, construction, \nand  maintenance  of  rural  infrastructure.  The  project  will  strengthen  the  management  and \ngeographic information systems of the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED), \ndevelop a special web portal interface for learning and networking with other agencies, and \nsupport establishing a community of practice.  \n \n20.  Enhanced capacity.17 The capability of LGED staff, local government units and target \ngroups will be strengthened to better prepare and manage climate-resilient rural infrastructure. \nCapacity development training will include climate resilience and disaster risk management, \ncontract  management,  procurement  including  international  competitive  bidding,  financial \nmanagement, construction supervision, quality control, operation and maintenance, gender and \ndevelopment, and monitoring and evaluation.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans   \n21.  The project is estimated to cost $150.0 million (Table 1), which includes incremental \ncosts for enhanced resilience to climate change. The cost of upgrading to future climate change \nstandards is 30%\u201340% higher than current practices.  \n \n                                                \n17 This subcomponent will be financed by the SCF, IFAD, and KfW. \n ", "6 \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem    Amounta \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n23.  The executing agency will be the LGED in the Local Government Division of the Ministry \nof Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives. A project steering committee will \nprovide policy guidance for project implementation. A project management office (PMO), to be \nestablished by the LGED at its headquarters in Dhaka, will implement the project. The chief \nengineer of the LGED will be responsible for project implementation and coordination. The PMO \nwill have one office in each of the three project regions. A project director in Dhaka will be \nassisted by two deputy project directors; the regional project offices will be responsible for the \nday-to-day  implementation  and  supervision  of  project  activities.  The  LGED  district  offices, \nheaded by executive engineers, will be responsible for implementing subprojects under the \nguidance of the PMO. The PMO will coordinate with Bangladesh Water Development Board for \ndevelopment interventions. The LGED will appoint two groups of consultants: (i) design and \nsupervision  consultants,  and  (ii)  management  support  consultants.  The  LGED  has  strong \ninstitutional  capacity;  its  capacity  in  international  competitive  bidding  procurement  will  be \nstrengthened through procurement training and clinics to be conducted by ADB\u2019s Bangladesh \nResident Mission. \n \n24.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual.19  \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2013\u2013December 2018 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2018  \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Project steering committee \n  Chair: Secretary, Local Government Division of the Ministry of Local \nGovernment, Rural Development and Cooperatives \n(ii)  Executing agency  LGED  \n(iii)  Key implementing  LGED divisional, regional, district, and upazila (subdistrict) offices \nagencies \n(iv)  Implementation unit  Project management office (Dhaka) \nRegional project offices (Barisal, Khulna, and Madaripur)  \nProject implementation units (12 districts) \nProcurement (financed by  International competitive bidding  2 contracts  $12 million \nADB and/or SCF)a  \n  National competitive bidding/shopping  14 contracts  $28 million \nConsulting services   QCBS (quality\u2013cost ratio: 90:10)  959 person-months  $7.3 million \n  QCBS (quality\u2013cost ratio: 90:10)  194 person-months  $2.4 million \nRetroactive financing  ADB may, subject to its policies and procedures, allow on request \nand/or advance  (i) advance contracting of civil works, equipment and materials, and \ncontracting for ADB or  consulting services; and (ii) retroactive financing of eligible expenditures up \nSCF financing  to 20% of each of proposed loans and grant, incurred prior to loan and \ngrant effectiveness but not earlier than 12 months before the date of signing \nof the related legal agreement.

Bidding packages procured using national competitive bidding \nmay follow the government\u2019s Public Procurement Act, 2006 and Public Procurement Rules, 2008 with modifications \nagreed between the government and ADB, as set out in the procurement plan. All consulting services will be \nengaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time).  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n25.  Economic analysis indicates that the project is viable. The economic analysis includes \nonly  quantifiable  benefits  associated  with  rural  roads  and  markets.  There  are,  however, \nsignificant nonquantifiable benefits including improvements in access to economic and social \nopportunities. Representative upazila and village road subprojects were analyzed to estimate \nviability for three scenarios: upgrading to current LGED standards, upgrading to existing climate \nresilience standards, and upgrading to future climate resilience standards. Based on upgrading \nto the highest level (future climate resilience), and allowing for the project overhead and land \nacquisition costs, economic internal rates of return are estimated at 14.0% for the upazila road, \n17.1% for the village road, 16.7% for the growth center market, and 28.7% for the village \nmarket. The sensitivity analysis confirms that the subprojects are extremely robust. Distribution \nanalyses confirm that the overall project will provide substantial benefits to the poor. \n \nB.  Governance \n26.  Project-specific governance risks have been analyzed by carrying out a governance risk \nassessment. A thorough assessment of the financial management and procurement capacities \nof the LGED was undertaken, and a set of realistic risk mitigation measures has been proposed \nand  discussed  with  the  government.  Risks  associated  with  project  management,  including \nprocurement and disbursement, will be mitigated by (i) providing consulting inputs to advise and \nassist in the procurement of goods and services; (ii) requiring that civil works contracts include a \ncondition that contractors adhere to ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date); \n(iii) the PMO periodically inspecting the contractor\u2019s fund withdrawals and settlements; and \n(iv) reporting  on  project  activities  and  implementation  on  the  LGED  website  to  foster \ntransparency and timely awarding of contracts. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to \nand  discussed  with  the  government  and  the  LGED.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual.  \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n27.  The project will help reduce poverty in the rural communities it covers. The beneficiaries \nwill be (i) road users (i.e., bus and truck owners and operators, passengers, and businesses \nusing freight services); (ii) market operators, traders, and market users; and (iii) communities in \nthe areas of influence of subprojects who will have improved access to services and increased \nemployment opportunities. An estimated 3.5 million people will directly benefit from the project. \nThe analysis of subproject roads indicates that the proportion of poor benefiting is 40%\u201346%. In \n ", "9 \naddition to the direct and indirect benefits from subprojects, jobs will be created as a result of \nsubproject construction. This is estimated at 10,200 person-years, of which at least 20% will be \nfor women. The project will also generate long-term and regular jobs for poor women belonging \nto labor contracting societies. Cyclone shelters will contribute to save human life and livestock in \nperiods  of  extreme  climatic  events. The  project  has  been categorized  an effective gender \nmainstreaming  project.  A  gender  action  plan  has  been  prepared  integrating  action  areas, \ntargets, and indicators for gender equality and women\u2019s benefits into the project components. A \nfocal point on gender and development will be established within the PMO to ensure that the \nmanagement  information  system  is  designed  to  handle  sex-disaggregated  data  collection, \ngender-based analysis, and review and reporting on the implementation of the gender action \nplan.  \n \nD.  Safeguards \n28.  Environment  (category  B).  The  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework, \ninitial  environmental  examinations,  and  environmental  management  plans  for  sample \nsubprojects have been prepared. The framework sets out the requirements for project screening \nand  classification,  subproject  selection,  information  disclosure  to  and  consultation  with  the \naffected people, environmental management plan development, implementation, and monitoring \nand reporting. The initial environmental examinations found the planned subprojects to have \nonly small and localized adverse impacts on the environment, which can be managed by the \nmitigation measures proposed in the environmental management plans.  \n \n29.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  A).  Some  land  acquisition  and  physical \ndisplacement will be required on many of the road subprojects as they will be raised and \nwidened to provide climate resilience. Land acquisition and resettlement will be negligible under \nthe  market  and  cyclone  shelter components, as  construction  is  expected to  remain  within \nexisting boundaries or on government lands. The government expects much of the land to be \nacquired  through  voluntary  donation.  As refusal  to  donate  land  or  enter  into  a  negotiated \nfinancial settlement would lead to expropriation (to retain climate-resilient design integrity), any \nsubproject that entails land acquisition (either through voluntary or involuntary means) resulting \nin economic or physical displacement will be subject to a resettlement plan. As the project is \nsector-oriented and most of the subprojects are not yet selected, a resettlement framework has \nbeen prepared. This will guide the preparation and implementation of land acquisition and \nresettlement  activities  across  the  project.  Resettlement  plans  have  been  prepared  for  two \nsample subprojects, which can be used as examples for future planning.  \n \n30.  Indigenous peoples (category B). Project preparation indicated that no indigenous \ncommunities will be impacted by any of the three sample subprojects analyzed. Given that \nmany more subprojects will be designed and undertaken over the course of the project and the \nproject area contains small numbers of distinct and vulnerable indigenous communities, an \nindigenous peoples planning framework20 has been developed to guide the screening and \nplanning  process  during  implementation.  The  LGED  has  strong  institutional  capacity  and \ncommitment for managing social risks and project compliance with ADB information disclosure \nbecause of wide experience in implementing similar ADB-supported projects. The proposed \ncapacity development program as part of the project design will further enhance its capacity. \n \n31.  IFAD and KfW will require that the subprojects financed by them in parallel comply with \nthe same environmental and social safeguard standards as those financed by ADB. \n                                                \n20 Referred to in the legal agreements as a small ethnic communities planning framework.  \n ", "10 \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n32.  The project involves some risks, which are manageable and will be largely mitigated \nduring implementation (Table 4). The integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh \nthe costs.   \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nImplementation delays, including  Potential delays in project start-up will be reduced by taking advance \ndisruptions during the upcoming  action on contracting of civil works and consulting services.  \ngovernment elections \nLack of sustainability of  Sustainability will be addressed by climate-resilient design, robust \ninterventions   and effective quality control arrangements during construction, and \npreparing road maintenance plans. \nSource: Asian Development Bank \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS  \n33.  The government and the LGED have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan and grant documents. The government and the \nLGED have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan \nand  grant  agreements.
