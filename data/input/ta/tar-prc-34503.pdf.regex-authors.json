In 2002, the Government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) requested Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  assistance  to  strengthen  the  PRC's  national  strategic  planning \nprocess. With the rapid transformation of the PRC, there is a need to continue to develop the \nnational strategic planning process to bring it more in line with best practices in developed \ncountries.  The PRC Government has proposed technical assistance (TA) throughout 2004 to \nstrengthen the planning process, leading to the drafting and eventual passage of the 11th Five-\nYear Plan (11FYP). A Fact-Finding Mission visited Beijing 09\u221215 October 2003 and reached an \nunderstanding  with  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  and  the  National  Development  Reform \nCommission  (NDRC)  on  the  objectives,  scope,  cost  financing,  and  implementation \narrangements for the TA. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n   \n2.  This advisory TA was originally included in the Country Strategy and Program Update \n(CSPU)  2002,  but  was  put  on  hold  due  to  the  impending  reorganization  of  the  State \nDevelopment Planning Commission (SDPC) now NDRC.1 MOF reiterated the proposal in March \n2003 following the reorganization of SDPC. The NDRC's formal request was for ADB assistance \nto strengthen its internal capacity to develop the PRC's 11th Five-Year National Development \nPlan  in  a  manner  that  is  more  participatory  and  comprehensive,  and  permits  increased \nfeasibility analysis, consistent with progressive strategic planning approaches. Very recently, \nMOF gave this TA its highest priority and indicated the urgency of beginning at an early stage in \nthe next FYP drafting cycle.2      \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The PRC's FYP system has been in existence since the founding of the PRC in 1949. \nSince the first FYP in 1953, the FYP has played a dominant role as the blueprint for defining the \nshift  from  a  command-driven  economy  to  one  that  is  propelled  by  market  forces.  Each \nsuccessive FYP has defined the formal path for development, providing the route and direction \nfor the successive steps of transition: from the command-driven system to a more liberalized \none.  The evolution FYP also mirrored the alterations in the role of government as it shifted \npower from central planning agencies to greater devolution and decentralization in decision \nmaking to subnational governments and the private sector. The FYP has accurately reflected \nthe changeover from a mainly competitive economic focus to one that is also concerned with \nsocial and sustainable development, structural and institutional reform, and is compatible with \nmarket economics.3 \n \n4.  The most recent 10FYP (2001-2005), referred to as the \u201cthe first magnificent blueprint \nfor the new century\u201d is an important milestone, as it ushered in more realistic official national \ntargets, priorities, policy orientations, and directions.4 Despite this progress, the FYP currently \nresembles a very detailed public investment plan rather than a national strategic plan with a \n                                                 \n1 During the March 2003 National People's Congress, the transformation of the former SDPC into the NDRC was \nannounced. Various planning entities and departments of other ministries were merged into a single formal \nplanning institution.  \n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 4 November 2003. \n3 Although the primary objective was economic growth, the FYP was far-reaching and was formulated due to the \nneed to combine growth and social development so as to reduce the East-West gap and differences between cities \nand rural areas and improve the connections across the provinces and the links across countries in the border \nareas, particularly the southern and western regions. \n4  Adopted in the Fifth Plenary Session of the XVth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the \nFourth Session of the IXth National People's Congress on 16 March 2002.  ", "2   \nclear vision and coordinated strategic objectives. In 10FYP, the government continues to have a \nstrong role in guiding resource allocation and does not confine its responsibility to provision of \npublic service and public goods or the enabling environment for the market to provide those. \nThe text also needs to be improved to make it more concise and provide more substance and \ndetails, particularly in analyzing issues and assessing the contribution of various plans to the \neconomy. \n \n5.  The Government recognizes that the FYP formulation process is significantly flawed.5 \nThe current system tries to cobble together some 6,000 separate subplans from a myriad of \ncentral  and  local  government  bodies  and  sector  entities.  There  is  no  overall  formulation \nframework  that  defines  the  process,  the  sequencing,  the  authorization,  and  roles  and \nresponsibilities of various contributing bodies. For example, the State Council (SC) has no \nauthorization to approve the provincial FYPs, but is required to check and approve the provincial \nurban municipal plans, formulated under the direction of the provincial plan. Although there exist \n16 specific laws and regulations passed by the National People\u2019s Congress (NPC) on individual \nplans,  there  are  no  overriding  laws  or  regulations  that  govern  the  planning  activities  of \ngovernment agencies or subnational governments, the standard content of these plans, and the \ndivision of labor for developing them. There are additional critical weaknesses: (i) the time frame \nfor the FYP is currently rigid without flexibility for various sector plans; (ii) there are three \nindependent systems for planning including regional planning, but effective coordination and \nintegration of the various levels have not yet been achieved or their linkages to annual plans \nformalized; (iii) public hearings need to be more inclusive and responsive by consulting with the \npublic at large on FYP formulation, with clearer rules, procedures, and participation criteria \napplicable to all contributing bodies;6 (iv) the planning process has not yet been linked to budget \nrealities or resource forecasting;7 and (v) Government focus is just on plan formulation and \nneglects implementation, performance evaluation, and risk management.  \n \n6.  In 10FYP there are strong poverty reduction and development content, including poverty \nreduction objectives, strategies, and specific targets (e.g., by 2005 gross domestic product per \ncapita  to  reach  CNY9,400;  40  million  urban and  40  million  rural  new  jobs  created;  urban \nunemployment not to exceed 5%, and so forth). Sustainable development is the key strategic \ndirection identified and individual sections are devoted to the poverty reduction agenda, the \nproportion of economic resources that will be allocated to action plans. The action plans call for \nfurther  reform,  especially  coordinated  economic  and  social  development,  to  improve  the \nlivelihoods of the poor.8 However, overall poverty reduction objectives and activities tend to be \nconfined to select chapters rather than systematically integrated throughout the FYP. \n                                                 \n5  An extensive review by National Development Reform Commission of the weaknesses of FYP. \n6  For the 10FYP, 10,000 comments were received from the public, following the posting of the draft on the Internet: \n300 were accepted.  For 11FYP, the first proposal calls for public bidding to research institutions and encourages \npublic  contributions  and  participation.  The  Law-Making  Law  does  not  set  minimum  standards  of  public \nconsultations,  the  time  frame  or  treatment  of  comments  from  the  public  at  large.  The  PRC  Governance \nAssessment identified weaknesses in the public consultation process. \n7  Much progress has been achieved on better budget management through support from the International Monetary \nFund (IMF), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and Department for International Development \n(DFID) in setting up single treasury accounts and setting out individual budgets for each government ministry.  \nWorld Bank and ADB have been supporting Government efforts to establish a progressive policy and institutional \nframework to reform expenditure and revenue assignments and to strengthen the fiscal alignment between central \nand subnational governments. The PRC Governance Assessment also identified lack of effective coordination of \nthe FYP with the multiyear expenditure framework. \n8  Action plans in the 10FYP address improving service delivery, access to the legal system, population, health, and \neducation, and set out planned activities for improvements to livelihoods. \n ", "3 \n7.  Declining impact of poverty reducing measures was identified in the October 2002 NPC \nas a major problem. The TA hopes to provide a strategic opportunity to influence the FYP by \nbetter prioritizing and sequencing actions for the poverty reduction policy and by providing ways \nto mainstream poverty reduction efforts through appropriate budget allocations. The TA will \nsupport the inclusion of appropriate policy responses that are pro-poor and mitigate further \ndeterioration of income distribution and a widening of the rural-urban divide and coastal-interior \ngaps. All five components of the TA hope to mainstream poverty reduction aspects. Specific \ninternational  country  models  that  incorporate  highly  consultative  approaches,  and \ngeographically equitable methodologies, and that place priority on poverty and social issues will \nbe selected. Consultation during implementation with contributors and civil society will help \nstrengthen  design  elements  that  will  best  correspond  to  improving  the  poverty  reduction \ncomponents of the planning process. Support in developing regulations and guidelines will \nstress poverty integration. \n \n8.  The planning cycle for 11FYP will run through three phases:9 (i) September 2003 to end-\n2004, the period of defining an improved planning system for addressing priority national issues \nand regional plans, formulating the regulations, and taking this to the SC for approval; (ii) during \nquarter  1  (Q1)\u2013Q3  2005,  drafting  the  11FYP  outline  framework  and  taking  it  to  public \nconsultation; and (iii) starting from Q4 2005, drafting the plan under the guidance of the SC and \nsubmitting  it  to  the  NPC  for  review  and  approval  following  Central  Party  Committee \nendorsements in March 2006 for sending up to NPC.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n9.    The objectives of the TA will be to increase the capacity of NDRC to improve the \nprocess of drafting 11FYP and subsequent FYPs in a manner more consistent with international \nbest practices. Specifically, it is to develop 11FYP in a manner that  (i) is more reflective of \nbroad public consultation, (ii) is linked to realistic budgetary and human resource forecasts, (iii) \nis better coordinated and aligned with the priorities of sector ministries and geographic regions, \nand  (iv)  incorporates  poverty  reduction  in  a  more  integrated  and  coordinated  fashion  into \nappropriate subsections and chapters. Overall, the TA is expected to enable the Development \nPlanning Department (DPD) of NDRC to produce a more consensus-driven, poverty reduction- \nsupporting FYP that has been derived from an improved public consultation process involving \ncitizens and civil society.  The outcome will be the advance to a more modern formulation and \ndrafting process, one that will improve the articulation of priority areas for support and tie these \nto a realistic budget framework. \n   \nB.   Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA has five components:  \n \n(i)  National  conference.  An  initial  conference  showcasing  several  international \nmodels will be held in Beijing for 100 participants. The participants will comprise \nplanning staff of the NDRC\u2019s DPD and representatives of academic and planning \nentities  such  as  the  National  People's  Congress  Consultative  Group,  State \n                                                 \n9 According to the outcome of the 3rd Plenary of the 16th Central Party Committee, the 11th FYP is expected to focus \non development of PRC\u2019s northeast area, to emphasize human resources and to concentrate on four key sectors. ", "4   \nEconomic and Planning Commission, State Development Research Council, and \ncounty and city planning staff.   \n \n(ii)  International intensive training. The TA will support a month-long intensive \ntraining program in two international country locations for two groups of 15 lead \nplanners from NDRC and county and city planning departments.  The training will \nprovide participants with intensive learning experience in international practices \nand approaches to national strategic plans.10 \n \n(iii)  Pilot project. The planning staff from six pilot counties and cities will attend a 1-\nday workshop that permits sharing experiences with NDRC participants of the \ninternational intensive training.11  \n \n(iv)  Drafting regulations. Assistance will be provided in drafting the directives and \nregulations  to  sector  ministries  and  county/city  governments  incorporating \nrevised  processes  gleaned  from  the  international  model  seminar  and  the \nintensive country training. \n \n(v)  Substantive  studies  on  five  topics.  Studies  will  be  commissioned,  both \ndomestic and international, on five topics that will help in formulating the FYP. \nThe selected topics will have significant implications for poverty reduction.12 \n \n11.  The  reports  emanating  from  the  seminar  and  from  international  training,  with \nrecommendations from international practice, will be disseminated to high-level officials in the \nSC. The outcomes of the TA will be incorporated into CSPU 2005. Training experiences will be \nused to scale up or bring lessons and experience in similar strategic country planning work to \nother transition developing member countries. The TA will complement the work of the World \nBank that has contributed to the 10FYP by providing 22 strategic notes on substantive subjects. \nThe six pilots will link up with Department for International Development (DFID) provincial \npartnerships,  particularly  for  provincial-level  poverty  strategy  formulation  and  with  other \ninitiatives such as those involving poverty workshops. This initiative will link to International \nMonetary Fund (IMF)/United Nation Development Programme (UNDP)/DFID work on the single-\ntreasury account and to other capacity-building initiatives on fiscal reform, and ongoing work to \nachieve a medium-term expenditure framework13. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated as $520,000 equivalent, of which $321,000 is in \nforeign exchange and $199,000 equivalent in local currency. The entire foreign exchange cost \n                                                 \n10 The international consultant will confirm the selection of all participants, in consultation with the project team. \n11 The representatives from the six pilot projects participated in training sponsored by International Business Machine \non local strategic planning in Germany.   \n12 The World Bank provided 22 substantive studies during the preparation of 10FYP, 19 of which were accepted by \nNDRC. No request as of this date has been made to the World Bank for the preparation of the 11FYP. The project \nteam will continue to liaise with the World Bank on its participation in the development of 11FYP.  \n13 The medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) is a multiyear budgeting tool designed to help the government \nplan expenditures for a given number of years (usually for a 3-year period) and evaluate projects and future \ninvestments. It aims to address macrofiscal planning as well as key sectoral expenditure issues. \n \n \n ", "5 \nand $39,000 equivalent of the local currency will be financed on a grant basis from the Poverty \nReduction Cooperation Fund. The Government will finance the balance of the local currency \ncost,  equivalent  to  $160,000,  through  the  provision  of  airline  tickets  for  domestic  and \ninternational travel of participants, and office space, counterpart staff, transportation, and other \nservices. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  NDRC will be the Executing Agency and its DPD will be the Implementing Agency. The \nDPD has the necessary expertise and capacity to substantially contribute to the planning, \ndetailed design, and implementation of the TA. The NDRC will provide the consultants with the \nnecessary office space, counterpart staff, transportation, translation, and other services and will \narrange appointments with relevant agencies and organizations. The central and county/city \ngovernments will support the airfare for their participants in the international intensive training \ncomponent. \n \n14.  The  TA  will  engage  an  international  consultant  for  4  person-months  of  intermittent \nservice over the TA implementation period and domestic consultants for 4 person-months. The \nterms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. The consultants will be selected and \nengaged as individuals in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB for selecting and engaging domestic consultants. The \nTA will start in January 2004 and will be completed in December 2004. Workshops will be \norganized near the end of the implementation period to invite comments from international and \ndomestic experts in the field and disseminate the findings of the report. An advance-payment \nfacility will be established, as conferences require funds prior to the conduct of the events. \n \n15.  The consultants will submit (i) inception reports 2 weeks after their services start; (ii) \ninterim  progress  reports,  which  will  include  workshop  evaluation  reports,  training  feedback \nreports from participants, draft regulations, and reports to the SC; (iii) draft final reports 2 weeks \nbefore the conclusion of the contract, taking note of relevant experiences and lessons learned \nduring the course of the training including the substantive studies; and (iv) the revised final \nreport 2 weeks after incorporating the comments of NDRC and ADB.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $360,000 to the Government \nof the People's Republic of China to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction \nCooperation  Fund  for  Capacity  Strengthening  of  PRC\u2019s  National  Development  Planning \nProcess, and hereby reports this action to the Board.
