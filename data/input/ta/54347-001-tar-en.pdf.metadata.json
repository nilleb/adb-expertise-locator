INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will help develop a model for an \neffective coordination mechanism between elderly care and health care services, focusing on the \ncommunity and home levels, in Xiangyang Municipality, Hubei Province, the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC). The model will draw upon an analysis of available resources on links between \nelderly  care  and  health  care  services,  institutional  arrangements  for  effective  coordination, \ninternational experiences, and capacity building requirements. The TA is included in the list of \nprojects agreed between the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the PRC Government on \n22 January 2020.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The PRC\u2019s population is aging rapidly, with 166.6 million people aged 65 and over in 2018, \nand an aging rate (the proportion of people aged 65 or older to the total population) of 11.9%.2 \nThe increase in the ratio of the population aged 80 or older is expected to accelerate from about \n1.8% in 2020 to more than 7.5% in 2050.3 The demand for elderly care is highly age-dependent \nand rises with longevity. The expected change in the demographic structure indicates that \ndemand  for  care  will  continue  to  accelerate  in  the  PRC.  Rapidly  aging  populations  are \naccompanied by increases in aging-associated diseases. Elderly people typically have chronic \ndiseases  and  experience  multiple  morbidities.  The  primary  cause  of  elderly  people\u2019s  care \ndependence is the loss of physical function resulting from chronic disease and impairments \nassociated with aging.4 In addition, many elderly people have complex cases of multiple chronic \ndiseases and physical and/or cognitive disabilities. Those elderly people would require both \nelderly care and health care services to sustain their daily living.5 \n \n3.  Elderly  people  account  for  an  increasing  percentage  of  hospitalization,  and  those \ndischarged are often functionally frail.6 In transition from hospitals, elderly care institutions, and \nhomes, elderly people are vulnerable and at risk of experiencing fragmented care.7 Frail elderly \npeople are often unprepared to face the challenges associated with continued care needs after \nhospitalization.  After  being  discharged  from  hospitals,  elderly  people  with  multiple  chronic \nconditions still require post-acute care and rehabilitation to stabilize their functions, along with \ncontinued care to retain and maintain their daily living. A coordination system that effectively links \nacute phase care, post-acute care, rehabilitation, and elderly care (covering institutional care as \nwell as community and home-based care) is key to ensuring continuity across elderly care and \nhealth care services and attaining better health outcomes for elderly people. \n \n4.  The Government of the PRC has recognized the importance of addressing the division \nbetween elderly care and health care services. A key policy, jointly issued by 10 ministries in 2015, \n \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 19 October 2020. \n2  National Bureau of Statistics of China. 2019.

Switzerland. \n5  Elderly care services, which is also called long-term care services, include care for activities of daily living, dementia \ncare, and non-intensive rehabilitation such as occupational therapy. Health care services include clinical, medical, \nnursing home care services, and physical therapy.  \n6  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 2015. Hospitalizations Among the Elderly.

However, proper integration of elderly care and health care services has not progressed \nin Xiangyang due to several constraints. A key issue is that the policy primarily focuses on the \ninstitutional level, while greater attention is needed to respond to the needs and services at the \ncommunity and home levels. The financial resources are limited for community and home-based \ncare services. Furthermore, the policy appears to focus more on physical integration by expanding \nelderly care institutions\u2019 scope to include health care services, whereas limited attention is \nprovided to establish a coordination mechanism between health care and elderly care. \n \n6.  Institutional coordination has also been ineffective, which limits the timely referral between \nelderly care and health care. The role of the municipal government in the provision of coordinated \ncare services is unclear, and institutional arrangements across those sectors have not been \nestablished. Furthermore, elderly care and health care providers do not have financial incentives \nto coordinate their services. Because of unclear lines of responsibility in the municipal government, \ncoordination among bureaus is not clearly defined, which critically limits the capacity of the \nmunicipal government to effectively manage the coordination of care services at the community \nand home levels. \n \n7.  Xiangyang Municipality needs to develop a coordination mechanism for elderly care and \nhealth care services, particularly at the community and home levels. An ongoing ADB TA project \nis supporting the development of an elderly care policy framework at the central government \nlevel.11 ADB has also been supporting local governments to strengthen their capacity to provide \nand manage care services.12 Building on that support with attention on institutional care, this TA \nwill continue and complement ADB\u2019s support by focusing on coordination of community and \nhome-based elderly care and health care services. It is aligned with the pillar on inclusive growth \nof ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020; and the Operational Plan for \nHealth, 2015\u20132020 which has elderly care as a focus area.13 It is also in line with ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2030 as it supports operational priority 6 (strengthening governance and institutional capacity) \nthrough strengthening service delivery.14 Coordination at the community and home levels is a key \nissue not only for Xiangyang but also for many other cities in the PRC. Further, it is a critical issue \nfor many aging societies. The TA will have a knowledge transfer impact not only in other cities in \nthe PRC but also in other developing member countries facing population aging challenges \nthrough TA seminars and dissemination of knowledge products.  \n \n8  Government of the PRC, State Council. 2015.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: accessibility to coordinated care services in \nXiangyang  Municipality  improved  (footnote  10).  The  TA  will  have  the  following  outcome: \ncoordination of elderly care and health care services at community and home levels in Xiangyang \nimproved.15  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Status of coordination among care services for elderly people examined. \nUnder output 1, the TA will examine the (i) status of long-term care services focusing on the \ncommunity and home levels in Xiangyang;16 (ii) status of health care services at the community \nand home levels and the health care-referral system in Xiangyang; (iii) status of coordination, if \nany, between long-term care and health care services; (iv)  financial mode, if any, for long-term \ncare services at the community and home levels, and the financial mode for health care services \nin Xiangyang; and (v) impact of those financial modes in coordinating long-term care and health \ncare services, including an analysis of financial incentives or disincentives for coordination. Based \non the above, a report on the status of coordination between elderly care and health care services \nfocusing on the community and home levels in Xiangyang Municipality will be prepared.17  \n \n10.  Output 2: Model for coordination between elderly care and health care services \nproduced.  Building  on  the  analyses  of  output  1  and  taking  international  practices  into \nconsideration, the TA will analyze the (i) types of elderly people who are at risk of breakdowns in \ncare and would benefit from coordinated elderly care and health care services, particularly at the \ncommunity and home levels; (ii) types of services that would most require coordination of elderly \ncare and health care services; (iii) key players in the provision of services across elderly care and \nhealth care; (iv) institutional arrangements needed for coordination; (v) a potential financial \nframework to incentivize coordination; and (vi) municipal government\u2019s role in establishing a \ncoordination mechanism. The interface issue across various information and communication \ntechnology systems of relevant bureaus and agencies will also be examined. Based on the above, \na report on a model for coordinating elderly care and health care services focusing on community \nand home levels in Xiangyang Municipality will be prepared.18  \n \n11.  Output 3: Knowledge and management capacity in coordinating elderly care and \nhealth  care  services strengthened.  Output 3  will  provide  opportunities to strengthen the \nknowledge  and  management  capacity  of  relevant  bureaus  and  agencies  of  Xiangyang \nMunicipality in (i) elderly care and health care service provision, particularly at the community and \nhome levels; (ii) needs for effective coordination; and (iii) a functional coordination mechanism of \ncare services through training, international and domestic study visits, and workshops. \n \n \n15 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n16 Civil society organizations could be care service providers at the community and home levels. Their potential active \nrole in care service provision will be analyzed under this TA project. Care services at the community level means that \nthe elderly people visit a care center or community center, and receive long-term care, rehabilitation, etc. For home-\nbased care, providers, such as caregivers and nurses, visit the homes of elderly people to provide care services.  \n17 Long-term care services are also called elderly care services, as described in the scope of care services in footnote 5. \n18 The coordination mechanism will consider the processes, methods, and tools required for coordination, as well as \ninstitutional arrangements. The model will be prepared with the Xiangyang Civil Affairs Bureau, which is responsible \nfor elderly care development in the municipality. \n ", "4   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $265,000, of which $250,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 2.  \n \n13.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \nspace for meetings, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB will administer the TA. The executing agency will be the Xiangyang Municipal \nGovernment  through  the  Xiangyang  project  management  office,  which  will  coordinate  with \nmunicipal  bureaus  and  agencies  to  carry  out  the  training  and  workshops  under  the  TA. \nImplementation arrangements are summarized in the table. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  November 2020\u2013December 2022  \nExecuting agency  Xiangyang Municipal Government through Xiangyang project \nmanagement office \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nFirm: Consultants\u2019  Elderly care\u2013health care  $92,680 \nqualifications  technical firm (focus on \nselection  community and home-based \ncare services) (national, \n16.5 person-months) \nIndividual: individual  Elderly care\u2013health care  $57,000 \nselection  specialist (international, \n3 person-months) \nIndividual: individual  Elderly care project  $16,850 \nselection  specialist (national, \n3 person-months) \nDisbursement  Disbursement of TA resources will follow ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from time to time). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, TA = technical assistance.  \nSource: ADB. \n \n15.
