An  initial  environmental  examination  was \nundertaken and the summary is a core appendix. \n \nProject Description  Infrastructure and equipment to upgrade the Tuvalu Maritime \nTraining Institute (TMTI) \n   \nRationale  The  social  and  economic  welfare  of  the  outer  islands  of \nTuvalu is critically dependent on the overseas remittances of \nTuvaluan seafarers, who are trained by TMTI. Upgrading of \nTMTI is essential to meet the current International Maritime \nOrganization  (IMO)  training  requirements  and  therefore \nensure the continued employment of Tuvaluan seafarers. \n   \nObjectives   The  objective  is  to  upgrade  the  structures  and  training \nfacilities of TMTI, to meet IMO training requirements and \nthereby remain on the IMO White List, ensuring that Tuvaluan \nseafarers  will  continue  to  be  employed  overseas.  This \nobjective will contribute significantly  to the goal of poverty \nreduction in the outer islands of Tuvalu and improve the \neducation and skills of Tuvaluan seafarers. The scope of the \nProject includes rehabilitating and extending training facilities \nat  TMTI;  upgrading  the  wharf  facilities;  improving  and \nincreasing staff accommodation; improving water, power, and \ncommunication  services;  procuring  specialized  training \nequipment; and extending shipping service offices. \n   \nCost Estimates  The total project base cost is estimated at US$2.04 million. \nThe total estimated project cost, including physical and price \ncontingencies and interest, is US$2.30 million. \n   \nFinancing Plan  Asian Development Bank: US$1,845,000  \nGovernment direct financial contribution: US$319,000 \nGovernment in-kind contribution: US$139,000 \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  The loan amount will be equivalent to SDR 1,394,000 from \nthe ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, to fund approximately \n80% of the cost of the Project, covering approximately 88% of \nthe foreign exchange costs. The loan will have a maturity of \n32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest \ncharge of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% \nper annum thereafter. The borrower will be Tuvalu.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 August 2005. ", " iv \n \n \n \n   \nEstimated Project Completion  28 February 2005 \nDate \n \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Education and Sports \n   \nImplementation  A  project  steering  committee  will  comprise  relevant \nArrangements  government  agencies,  including  the  Ministry  of  Works, \nCommunication,  and  Transport  for  technical  advice.  An \nindependent project management unit will receive specific \nassistance from the loan to provide advice on tendering and \ncontract  supervision.  TMTI  will  manage  the  assets  on \nAmatuku Island, and the Shipping Services will manage the \noffices on Fongafale. \n   \nProcurement  The main contract package, valued at approximately US$1.7 \nmillion, will be offered under international competitive bidding \nprocedures.  Materials  and  equipment  valued  below \nUS$50,000  will  be  procured  under  direct  purchase \nprocedures. \n   \nConsulting Services  Approximately  7  person-months of international consulting \nservices will be required for the project management unit and \nare estimated at US$157,000. \n   \nProject Benefits and  Upgrading  of  the  TMTI  facilities  will  ensure  that  future \nBeneficiaries  maritime training meets IMO guidelines and that Tuvaluan \nseafarers  will  therefore  still  have  fair  access  to  overseas \nemployment. This will allow the continued flow of overseas \nremittances, upon which the social and economic welfare of \nthe outer islands of Tuvalu depends. Specific beneficiaries of \nthe Project include TMTI staff, trainees, Tuvaluan seafarers, \nshipping service staff, and outer island communities. More \nthan 60% of the population of Tuvalu, many of whom are \neconomically disadvantaged, are expected to receive some \nbenefit from the Project. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions   The main risk associated with the Project concerns human \nimmunodeficiency  virus/acquired  immune  deficiency \nsyndrome, which is spreading rapidly in the Pacific. However, \nseveral development organizations in Tuvalu already address \nthis issue adequately. The Project's main assumption is that \nthe Government will ensure competent management  of TMTI \nat all times. \n   \nTechnical Assistance  Organizational Strengthening and Curriculum and Program \nDevelopment at TMTI; total project cost of US$343,000, of \nwhich US$291,000 is financed from the Japan Special Fund, \nfunded by the Government of Japan. \n   \n \n ", "v \n  \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Tuvalu for the Maritime Training Project. The report also describes proposed technical \nassistance (TA) for organizational strengthening, and curriculum and program development at \nTuvalu Maritime Training Institute (TMTI), and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. (The project framework \nis in Appendix 1). \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Tuvalu is composed of nine low-lying coral atolls scattered in the Central Pacific Ocean. \nIt has a land area of 26 square kilometers (km2) and an exclusive economic zone of 900,000 \nkm2 of ocean. The total resident population is about 10,340. The capital island, Fongafale in the \nFunafuti atoll, has an area of only 2.8 km2, but accounts for more than half of the population and \ntwo-thirds of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the country. \n \n3.  Seafarers trained at TMTI are by far the most important source of remittances to the \nouter islands. These remittances comprise the major part of household income, financing house \nconstruction, school fees, business investment, and consumption. They are also a valuable \nsource of foreign exchange. About 1,000 TMTI graduates are registered for employment as \nseafarers, of which 470 currently are working overseas. Annual overseas earnings of seafarers \nin the last 2 years are in the range A$5 million-8 million. Most of this is remitted directly to bank \naccounts in Tuvalu, while some of it is spent overseas or used to pay directly for imports. The \nremittances and imports to Tuvalu by seafarers are significant compared with annual GDP of \nabout A$18 million. Moreover, seafarer income is distributed to all the outer islands. In some \nislands, overseas remittances comprise as much as 50\u201360% of the family income, especially in \nareas dominated by subsistence activity. \n \n4.  TMTI was established in 1979 as the Tuvalu Maritime School, situated on Amatuku islet, \na self-contained islet immediately northwest of Fongafale. The institute provides training for \nyoung  Tuvaluan  men  to  enable  them  to  seek  employment  aboard  foreign  vessels. \nApproximately 43% of the male population of working age in Tuvalu are employed as seafarers \n(the extremely limited resource base of Tuvalu means that job and business opportunities are \nminimal). TMTI offers three 12-month pre-sea and shipboard programs yearly, each taking 20 \nnew entrants. For trainees to continue to be qualified to work on international ships, the institute \nmust conform to the standards as defined by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), \nspecifically  the  requirements  stipulated  by  the  International  Convention  on  Standards  of \nTraining, Certification, and Watchkeeping as amended in 1995 (STCW 95). These requirements \nalso apply to the free refresher and upgrade training offered by TMTI to the 1,000 registered \nworking  seafarers,  who  must  complete  specific  safety  training  in  order  to  continue their \nemployment on foreign vessels. \n \n5.  TMTI is at a critical juncture ?  it does not have the requisite training facilities to meet all \ncurrent IMO training requirements, and the existing infrastructure and supply of basic services to \nresidents on Amatuku are inadequate. Tuvalu must demonstrate to IMO and overseas crewing \nagencies that TMTI is addressing the infrastructure and training deficiencies. The planned \nupgrading and infrastructure investment must also be implemented as soon as possible, to \navoid jeopardizing the future employment of Tuvaluan seafarers.  If TMTI cannot meet IMO ", " 2 \n \n \n \ntraining requirements, then Tuvaluan seafarers cannot work, and the significant revenue flows \nto the outer islands would terminate. Recruitment of the current chief executive officer of TMTI \nand the corporatization of TMTI in July 2000 were major steps toward professional management \nof the institute using sound business principles. These steps were prerequisites for the physical \nupgrading of TMTI and the associated TA in capacity building. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Problems and Opportunities \n6.  STCW 95 stipulates the standards that every country must ensure its training institutions \nand maritime administration meet, in order that its nationals may work on foreign-going vessels \nand that vessels sailing international waters under its flag may continue to operate. The purpose \nof the convention is to ensure that all seafarers are educated and trained to at least a minimum \nstandard and have sufficient experience to perform their duties competently, and thus minimize \nrisk to life, property, and the marine environment.  \n \n7.  Tuvalu gained White List status in November 2000 after compilation of a submission that \ndocumented the policies and procedures established to ensure that required standards as \noutlined were met. This initial assessment by IMO was largely based on information supplied by \nTuvalu itself, and was essentially a desktop audit exercise. However, attaining White List status \nwas just the beginning of the work necessary to ensure the continued employment of Tuvalu \nseafarers. These standards and procedures specified in the original White List submission to \nIMO must be adhered to, and the Marine Department (MD) must be able to demonstrate that \nworking systems are in place to ensure compliance. MD, as the maritime administration of \nTuvalu, is responsible for compliance. \n \n8.  To maintain White List status, Tuvalu must submit to an external audit process at \nintervals no longer than 5 years. This external audit is intended to identify the extent of \ncompliance, determine the effectiveness of quality systems, provide opportunities to improve \nquality control, and establish an effective and efficient audit system. The performance and \nquality systems of MD in roles other than ensuring the quality and conduct of training at TMTI is \nalso subject to this external audit process, including search and rescue, port state control \ninspections, flag state control inspections, and the certification of seafarers.  \n \n9.  However, gaining the initial place on the White List may well prove to be the easiest part \nof the process for many of the 72 nations currently holding that status. The Regional Maritime \nProgramme of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), is of the opinion that, of the 10 \nPacific Island nations currently on the White List, 5 would be at risk of losing their status in the \nevent of external audit by an IMO approved agent? among them Tuvalu. The common issue \nappears  to  be  development  of  the  required  systems  to  assure  the  certification \nprocedures? databases,  establishment  of  audit  procedures  and  audit  history,  and  general \ndocumentation of processes. Informal comment indicates that a commonality among states at \nrisk is lack of separation of the maritime administration function from that of a larger and more \ndiverse government department. In those Pacific island countries where a separate entity is able \nto focus clearly on the roles and functions required by STCW 95 (such as Tonga), authorities \nappear better equipped to meet the obligations imposed.  \n \n10.  As of 30 September 2001, 1,036 seafarers retained active membership with the Tuvalu \nOverseas Seamen\u2019s Union (TOSU). On that date, 470 individuals were at sea according to the \n   \n \n ", "3 \nemployment records of the recruiting agencies based in Tuvalu. These agencies estimate that \nthe seafarers spend approximately 60% of their working life on the vessels, indicating that the \ncurrent employment pool on that date should be estimated at 783 to allow for those resting \nbetween  contracts  and  in  transit  to  join  vessels.  This  leaves  a  total  of  253  absent  from \ntheoretical employment status, a figure that approximately corresponds with the total of those \nseafarers who have been subject to suspension  from employment for alcohol or disciplinary \nreasons.  Seafarer employment varies from year to year, reflected in the remittances to Tuvalu. \n  \n11.  The global market for employment at sea presently favors the employment of deck and \nengineering officers, as opposed to those seafarers with basic qualifications as deck or engine \nroom ratings1 currently graduating from TMTI, and the employment outlook for the years through \nto 2010 presents no predicted change in outlook within an increasingly competitive market. The \ntypical classifications of Tuvaluan seafarers include able seaman, ordinary seaman, motorman \n(the latter three comprising the majority), pumpman, bosun, deck fitter, engine fitter, wiper, cook, \nsteward, and messman. \n   \n12.  The historical employment link for Tuvalu seafarers is with German shipping companies,  \nand this link has been consistent from the inception of the Tuvalu Maritime School in 1979 until \ntoday. The strength, stamina, and natural ability of seafarers from Tuvalu have greatly assisted \ntheir employment opportunities in the past. In the competitive market that prevails now, less \nvalue is placed on these characteristics, and factors such as the ability to conclude amicable \ncollective employment agreements with TOSU are viewed favorably.  \n \n13.  Two main factors present a risk to the continuation of current employment figures, and \nas barriers to employment growth: (i) a growing propensity for incidents of alcohol abuse and \nconsequent violence; and (ii) a marked drop in the standard of oral and written English, noted \nanecdotally by employers, agents, and TMTI staff. Problems with English and alcohol will pose \na significant barrier to widening the pool of potential employers, in particular the operators of \npassenger cruise vessels, which have been identified as having future employment potential. \nOne of the German employers has already taken the step of declaring their vessels free of \nalcohol in an effort to address the problem. However, the employment agents all noted the \npositive changes related to these problems achieved in recent times. If the problems can be \nkept under control, the present agents see a good future for the continued employment of \nTuvaluan seafarers. \n \n14.  The weak organizational setup of MD, with its cramped office space and poor staffing, \nprevents efficient administration of cargo and domestic passenger services. Similarly affected is \nMD\u2019s involvement in training of TMTI students onboard the Nivaga II, one of the vessels under \nMD\u2019s responsibility. Deficiencies in MD functions could result in Tuvalu being struck from the \nWhite List, which would prevent Tuvaluan seafarers from working overseas; the same effect as \nnoted for TMTI. Tuvalu Shipping Services, a unit under MD, therefore also needs attention in \nthe near term, to ensure that weaknesses in this area do not compromise the efforts at TMTI. \nAssistance to MD within both the Project and the associated TA is therefore incorporated. \nDetails on Tuvalu Shipping Services are provided in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n15.  In discussions with the Government, there is general agreement that cost recovery for \nTMTI\u2019s training services should, to the extent possible, be recovered from users. It will be \nimportant for the Government to explore alternative mechanisms for accomplishing this.  \n                                                 \n1  Rating is essentially a naval term referring to noncommissioned sailors; in general usage it refers to the crew of a \nvessel, other than officers. \n  \n ", " 4 \n \n \n \n \n16.  Infections with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency \nsyndrome (AIDS) are increasing rapidly in the Pacific. High-risk groups include seafarers and, \nfor a country like Tuvalu with such a small population, the consequences can be dire. However, \nSPC and TOSU have comprehensive HIV/AIDS awareness programs under implementation, \nand  other  development  agencies  are  considering  additional  assistance.  With  this  level  of \nsupport, the HIV/AIDS issue is being appropriately addressed and any additional assistance \nwould probably exceed the absorptive capacity of the targeted audience. \n \n2.  Lessons Learned \n17.  There has been no formal evaluation of projects to strengthen training institutes for \nseafarers in the Pacific region. The Pacific region has 7 maritime training institutes; their \ncurricula and specialization are guided by the Regional Maritime Programme of SPC. The \nprinciples in the SPC strategy have been to avoid competition between the countries and \ninstead focus on comparative advantages. Tuvalu, being by far the smallest country with \nrespect to population, has taken advantage of the positive attributes of its seafarers, such as \ngeneral fluency in English, pleasant personalities, strong physiques, and, lately, the collective \nemployment agreement with TOSU. However, SPC has repeatedly warned against broadening \nits curriculum to include officer training, as the costs would be too high and, the human resource \nbase, too small. \n  \n18.  The Project has taken the SPC strategy into consideration. The proposed upgrade of \nTMTI and the associated TA in curriculum development, therefore, focus only on training of \nratings. The competition from other countries is growing, but the strong and long-standing \nrelationship with the German shipping agencies is likely to continue if the standards are kept up \nto IMO requirements. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objectives  \n19.  The main objective of the Project is to ensure that TMTI can continue to provide basic \ntraining  and  more  specialized  refresher  and  upgrade  training  to  prospective  and  current \nTuvaluan seafarers, in a manner that meets IMO training standards. This will be achieved by (i) \nupgrading the infrastructure at TMTI and MD, (ii) providing training equipment, and (iii) providing \ninstitutional support to TMTI and MD under the associated TA. By addressing education needs \nand access to international job opportunities, the Project contributes directly to the goals of \nmore equitable income distribution and poverty reduction, particularly in the outer islands.  \n \nB.  Components and Outputs  \n20.  The infrastructure upgrade includes (i) a wharf extension and installation of specialized \nsafety-at-sea training equipment, (ii) installation of a fire fighting facility, (iii) increase in the water \ncatchment and storage capacity, (iv) construction of new staff housing, (v) rehabilitation and \nextension of trainee quarters and training facilities, (vi) installation of a backup solar power \nsystem, (vii) renovation of existing staff houses, (viii) installation of improved telecommunication \nsystems, (ix) procurement of specialized training and operational equipment, and (x) extension \nand improvement of MD offices on Fongafale. \n \n   \n \n ", "5 \n21.  The number of qualified seafarers graduating from an increasing number of maritime \nschools around the world, and the subsequent tightening of IMO standards, highlight the need \nfor TMTI to maintain its comparative advantage. The specialized training equipment proposed \nand the general upgrade of all facilities on Amatuku are the minimum requirements for a training \ninstitute to carry out professional training to IMO standards. \n \nC.  Special Features \n22.  Two  important  requirements  must  be  considered  with  respect  to  the  infrastructure \nupgrade  at  Amatuku.  All  buildings  should  be  made  to  standards  that  require  minimum \nmaintenance and, at the same time, can withstand the harsh environment of tropical sun, \nseawater spray, and occasional typhoons. Because Amatuku has no groundwater, the water \ncatchment from all buildings should feed into a larger water storage tank system. Both issues \nwill be addressed under the Project. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n23.  The total project base cost is estimated at US$2.04 million. The total estimated project \ncost, including physical and price contingencies and interest during construction, is US$2.3 \nmillion. The annual allowance for price contingencies over the 3-year implementation period is \n2.4% for foreign exchange costs and 2.5% for local currency costs. The physical contingencies \nvary from 5% to 27.5% for the various items of infrastructure and equipment, based on the \ndegree of uncertainty in estimating their costs.

The Government has requested that the foreign exchange and local currency \ncomponents of the Project be financed as shown in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n(US$ \u2018000) \n \n  Foreign  Local  Total   \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Amount  Percent \n         \nAsian Development Bank  1,845  0  1,845         80 \nGovernmenta  241  217  458         20 \n  Total  2,086  217  2,303  100 \n  Percent  91  9  100   \na  Part of the Government\u2019s contribution will be in-kind through the provision of machinery. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n25.  The Government has requested a loan equivalent to $1.845 million from ADB's Asian \nDevelopment Fund to finance 80% of the cost of the Project covering approximately 88% of the \nforeign exchange cost. The proposed loan will have a maturity of 32 years, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years, and interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter. The Borrower will be Tuvalu. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n26.  The Ministry of Education and Sports (MES) will be the Executing Agency. MES has not \nbeen involved with ADB loan projects previously, but TMTI has been the recipient of various aid \n   \n \n ", "7 \nprojects  over  the  last  3\u20134  years.  Staff  at  TMTI  will  be  directly  involved  in  planning  and \nimplementing the Project, since the construction on Amatuku will require close coordination with \nTMTI\u2019s routine training and educational activities. Similarly, staff at MD will be involved in the \nplanning  and  coordination  of  office  extension  activities  proposed  for  the  Project.  The \norganizational  structure  of  TMTI  and  educational  issues  are  described  in  Supplementary \nAppendix B. \n \n27.  TMTI staff are fully capable of coordinating the construction activities on Amatuku; \nhowever, the actual project implementation will involve construction by professional builders \nexperienced  in  modular  construction  in  tropical  areas.  An  international  consultant  will  be \nengaged to assist with construction supervision and all tender procedures. \n \n28.  A project management unit (PMU) will be set up within MES. The PMU will be headed by \nthe assistant secretary of MES and assisted by the superintendent of TMTI, the director of MD, \nand  a  qualified  engineer  from  the  Public  Works  Department.  The  supervisory  consulting \nengineer will work within the PMU. The PMU will manage and oversee Project implementation \naccording to the implementation schedule, including recruitment and supervision of consultants, \nprocurement of goods and services, contract management, project planning, disbursement, \nrecords, and reporting. TMTI will manage the assets on Amatuku as they come on stream, and \nthe Shipping Services and MD will manage the offices on Fongafale. Indicative maintenance \ncosts, under various scenarios, are provided in Supplementary Appendix C.  \n \n29.  A project steering committee, comprising involved government agencies with relevant \ntechnical expertise, including the Public Works Department and MD, will be established and will \nmeet quarterly to discuss and guide project implementation and review the planning process. \n \n2.  Period of Implementation \n30.  The Project will be implemented over 28 months from November 2002 to February 2005, \nwith tendering and review of proposals occurring on or about December 2002 (detailed designs \nin Supplementary Appendix D). The supervisory engineer is expected to assure a phased \nconstruction process, with the most critical training facilities completed first, while reducing the \npressure  of  construction  crews  on  island  resources  and  potential  disruption  to  routine \neducational activities on Amatuku. The implementation schedule in Appendix 3. \n \n3.  Procurement \n31.  All procurement financed by the loan will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement. Civil works comprise most of the loan and will be tendered in one package under \ninternational competitive bidding procedures. Equipment and material valued below US$50,000 \nwill be procured under direct purchase procedures. The contract packages are in Appendix 4. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n32.  An  individual  consultant  will  be  engaged  for  approximately  7  person-months.  The \nconsulting engineer will be responsible for prequalification and evaluation of tenders, and in \nparticular, assist with the tendering process and construction supervision. The consultant will be \npart of the PMU. The consultant will be recruited by TMTI in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants. The terms of reference are in Appendix 5. \n  \n ", " 8 \n \n \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n33.  MES will establish an imprest account at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB. The \nimprest account will be established, managed, replenished, and liquidated in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, as amended. The ceiling of the imprest account will not \nexceed the equivalent of US$50,000. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedure may be used \nfor  reimbursement  of  expenditures  less  than  US$50,000  equivalent  and  for  liquidation  of \nadvances made from the imprest account.  \n \n6.  Account, Audit, and Report \n34.  MES will maintain consistent records and accounts adequate to identify goods and \nservices financed from the proceeds of the loan. MES will (i) maintain separate accounts for the \nProject; (ii) ensure that accounts and related financial statements are audited annually in \naccordance with sound auditing principles by independent auditors acceptable to ADB; and \n(iii) submit to ADB, not later than 6 months after the close of each fiscal year, certified copies of \nthe audited accounts and the report of the auditor. Quarterly reports, detailing implementation \nprogress,  achievements  in  accordance  with  the  indicators  in  the  project  framework, \ndisbursement, consulting input, as well as issues pertaining to disbursement projections for the \nfollowing quarter and any delay in implementation schedule, will be prepared by the PMU and \nsubmitted to MES with copies made available to ADB. MES will be the administrative focal point \nfor the loan and will submit brief monthly project progress reports to ADB via fax or E-mail. MES \nwill submit a project completion report to ADB within 3 months after physical completion of the \nProject. \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n35.  Benefit monitoring and evaluation will be assessed through the project benefit and \nmonitoring evaluation function of the Island Development Program,2 which already collects \ninformation on seafarer remittances to the outer islands.  \n \n8.  Project Reviews \n36.  An inception mission will be fielded 1 month after the supervisory engineer consultant \nhas invited tenders, and a midterm review will be undertaken at the end of the first  year of \nimplementation. A final review will be undertaken at Project completion. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n37.  The objective of the TA is to complement the physical infrastructure upgrade of TMTI by \naugmenting  TMTI\u2019s  technical  capability  so  that  it  can  meet  the  training  standards  and \nrequirements of STCW 95. The TA will provide advice and assistance on the continuous \nimprovement  of  teaching  resources  and  techniques,  student  learning  resources,  and \nenhancement  of  employment  outcomes  from  existing  programs;  maximize  the  training \nopportunities  available  through  the  Nivaga  II  and  other  vessels;  as  well  as  develop  new \nprograms or integrate existing programs, as necessary. It is also directed at implementation of \ninternational ship management and planned maintenance procedures of the vessels of the \nShipping Services, along with a focus on competency-based assessment training with TMTI. \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 1999. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to Tuvalu \nfor the Island Development Program. Manila. \n   \n \n ", "9 \n38.  An  international  consulting  firm,  maritime  institute,  or  individual  consultants  will  be \ncontracted to provide approximately 11 person-months of international consulting services, on a \nstaggered basis over 2 years, in the following fields (i) management and organization (3 person-\nmonths), (ii) maritime education (3 person-months), (iii) technical subject matter (2 person-\nmonths), and (iv) maritime engineering (3 person-months). Consulting services will be recruited \nunder the quality and cost-based selection method in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants. The simplified technical proposal procedure will apply. \n \n39.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at US$343,000 equivalent, of which US$291,000 is \nthe  foreign  exchange  cost  and  US$52,000  equivalent  is  the  local  currency  cost.  The \nGovernment has requested ADB to finance, on a grant basis, a total of US$291,000 to cover the \nentire  foreign  exchange  cost.  The  foreign  exchange  costs  of  the  TA  cover  consultants\u2019 \nremuneration, per diem, international and local travel, report production, training materials, \ncommunication, and contingencies. The Government will provide the remaining US$52,000 \nequivalent in local currency by providing counterpart staff, office facilities, and local counterpart \ntravel. ADB will finance the TA on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment of Japan. The TA cost estimates are in Appendix 6. \n \n40.  While MES will be the Executing Agency of the TA, the day-to-day implementation \nresponsibilities  will  be  vested  with  the  superintendent  of  TMTI.  TMTI  will  also  provide \ncounterpart staff to the consultants. The TA will be implemented over a period of 2 years \ncommencing November 2002, and with a closing date of December 2005. The TA will provide a \nfront-loaded input of targeted assistance in the first year to ensure effective and compliant \ndelivery of STCW 95 survival and fire-fighting training by TMTI, implementation of international \nship management, planned maintenance procedures of the vessels of the Shipping Services, \ncompetency-based  assessment  training  with  TMTI  staff,  and  maximization  of  training \nopportunities presented by the availability of the  Nivaga II. Each of the annual inputs will \ncommence  with  a  meeting  of  the  consultants  and  the  TMTI  board  validating  an  annual \nimplementation plan formulated on a current needs assessment for TMTI against the scope and \nobjectives of the TA. \n \n41.  The consultants will be required to submit assessment reports following each input, as \nwell as a brief outline of the possible needs to be addressed during their assignments. Upon \ncompletion of the consultancy  for each specific subject area, the consultant concerned will \nproduce  a  final  report  with  clear  recommendations  on  how  to  ensure  sustainability  and \ncontinued accreditation to the IMO White List. \n \n42.  The superintendent of TMTI will provide ADB with quarterly assessments, reporting on \nimplementation progress, issues that will require any variation from the specified inputs, as well \nas validation of the indicators specified in the project framework. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits \n1.  General \n43.  The  main  benefit  from  the  Project  is  that  it  will  allow  TMTI  to  continue  to  be  an \naccredited maritime training institution maintaining its White List status. Other benefits from the \nProject are increased earnings from Tuvaluan international  seafarers that will flow into the \ncountry. In this case, the with-project situation is the continuing operation of TMTI, with an \n  \n ", " 10 \n \n \n \nincrease in the number of trainees that graduate each year and the provision of upgrading and \nrevalidation courses to the pool of active seafarers. The without-project situation assumes that \nTMTI loses its White List status, is no longer an accredited maritime training institute, and has to \nclose down. The Government would then be faced with having to send its young men to a \ncomparable training institute overseas. Upgrading and revalidation short courses would also \nhave to be conducted overseas. Lack of English proficiency would likely reduce the intake of \nTuvaluans at an overseas training institute and the pool of trained seafarers would continue to \ndecrease over time as individuals retire, with a consequent reduction in the amount of their \nearnings remitted back to Tuvalu. \n \n2.  Institutional \n44.  Currently, TMTI conducts three classes of maritime training: \n \n(i)  1-year residential basic training course for new entrants before employment at \nsea (TMTI takes in 60 trainees per year in three intakes of 20 and, normally, 50 \ncomplete the course and graduate; 4 months of the time is spent undergoing sea \ntraining on the Nivaga II); \n \n(ii)  upgrade courses of 3 weeks duration for basic fire-fighting, safety, and sea \nsurvival training (this course is normally provided once during the career of a \nseafarer, usually within the first 2\u20133 years of employment; the upgrade allows the \nseafarers to move up the pay scale and receive an immediate increase in pay); \nand \n \n(iii)  revalidation and refresher course for seafarers (each seafarer must revalidate the \ncertificate every 5 years to maintain his employment status under STCW 95; the \ncourse normally lasts 1 week and involves fire-fighting, sea safety, and tanker \nskills, with the objective of refreshing the seafarers' skills, allowing for changes in \ntechnology  and  competency  requirements.  On  average,  around  150\u2013200 \nseafarers require revalidation per year). \n \na.  The With-Project Situation \n45.  TMTI is upgraded and maintains its White List status. The improved facilities allow an \nincrease in the number of new entrants to a level where 70 graduate each year from an intake \nof up to 90 trainees, compared with the present situation where 50 graduate each year from an \nintake of 60. Upgrading and revalidation courses are conducted as required and the existing \npool of active seafarers have the opportunity to attend the upgrading and revalidating courses at \nTMTI. \n \n46.  The average working life for a Tuvaluan seafarer is assumed to be 15 years, which \nrepresents a loss from the pool of seafarers of 7% per year. The output of 70 new seafarers per \nyear is sufficient to maintain the pool of trained and active seafarers at around the current level \nof 1,000. \n \n47.  The operating costs of TMTI are increased to reflect the required maintenance of the \nexisting and new infrastructure, with replacement of capital items and equipment as needed. \n \n   \n \n ", "11 \nb.  The Without-Project Situation \n48.  TMTI loses its White List status within 2 years and is forced to close down. The \nGovernment, recognizing the importance of the seafarers\u2019 employment to the country, continues \nto fund a reduced number of new trainees to receive their training overseas at an institute that \nhas  the  capacity  to  undertake  such  training.  Some  trainees  may  also  fund  themselves. \nHowever, because of the more difficult logistics in organizing the overseas training, and the \nstricter entrance requirements for the overseas institutions (such as the level of English ability), \nthe number of trainees who successfully complete the training is reduced to only half of the \ncurrent  output  and  only  25  new  seafarers  graduate  each  year.  This  results  in  a  gradual \nreduction in the pool of trained and active seafarers, based on the same attrition rate of 7% per \nyear. Consequently, the number of employed seafarers is reduced and remittance income \ndiminishes accordingly over time. \n \n49.  All upgrading and revalidation courses would have to be conducted overseas as well, \npossibly contributing to a greater attrition rate, as seafarers decide that continuing employment \nas a seafarer is too difficult. Some trainees who go overseas may lose their links with Tuvalu \nand emigrate permanently, reducing the amount of income remitted home to Tuvalu. The net \nresult is that the level of income that Tuvalu receives from its seafarers is severely reduced as \nthe pool of active workers decreases over time. \n \nB.  Social and Environmental Impacts \n1.  Social Issues \n50.  The social context on Amatuku is quite straightforward, comprising 12 TMTI professional \nand support staff (25 individuals, when family members are included), and no more than 40 \ntrainees at any one time. The island is about 1 kilometer long by 200 meters wide (at the widest \npoint). Conditions are probably more favorable than most other locations throughout Tuvalu, \nwith independent (although sometimes unreliable) power supply, telephone communication, \ndaily access to the facilities on Fongafale, and a pleasant well-vegetated setting. Water is \nlimited at times. The maximum population is 65 and maximum population density is about \n430/km2, slightly higher than the population density in the more populated outer islands, but \nmuch less than Fongafale. Five TMTI staff members commute by boat from Fongafale. Women \nare in the minority on Amatuku, given that this is a training facility for men. Only a few women \nmembers of TMTI staff families live on the island. \n \n51.  The  land  occupied  by  TMTI  is  on  a  long-term  government  lease  from  private \nlandowners. No apparent issues are related to the lease. The southern end of Amatuku (about \n100 meters long) is still privately held and the small islet immediately to the north is also in \nprivate hands. Housing is provided to some TMTI staff and the dormitory is used to house the \ntrainees. Staff housing is located toward the northern end of the island, whereas the trainees \nare housed in the southern section of the property. Segregation of residential areas from \ntraining and service areas is quite good and dense vegetation screens in most residential areas \nto provide some privacy. Housing is provided essentially free, with a nominal rent paid to TMTI. \n \n52.  The construction activities required to upgrade TMTI can be managed with minimal \nsocial impacts, especially as the construction can be phased over 2 years to reduce pressure on \narea and services. The proposed upgrading of the facilities on Amatuku will bring significant \nbenefits: improved provision of basic services, better training facilities, and more comfortable \nhousing. The social impacts and benefits of the construction project itself are considered in the \n  \n ", " 12 \n \n \n \nSummary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy in Appendix 7 and detailed in Supplementary \nAppendix E. \n \n2.  Poverty Impact \n53.  As a result of the Project, the pool of seafarers actively involved in overseas employment \nwill be maintained at the present level of 1,000, with around 45%, or 450, actually working \noverseas at any one time. Without the Project, the pool of seafarers will likely decline over time \nthrough attrition, due to retirement and other factors, with the number of new seafarers being \ntrained not sufficient to maintain the numbers. After 25 years, the total active pool will have \nreduced from 1,000 to only 470. \n \n54.  About half of the males of working age are trained as seafarers. An estimated 60% of all \nhouseholds, or around 6,000 people, receive benefits directly from the remittance income \nearned by the seafarers. In the absence of the Project, this will reduce over time by at least \n50%; thus about 30% of the households in Tuvalu stand to benefit directly from the Project. \n \n55.  The net increase in the level of remittance income due to the Project is estimated to total \nA$3 million by the end of the Project's life. This is equivalent to A$1,000 per person. No \ninformation on the distribution of poor households is available for Tuvalu, but the impact of this \ndistribution  can  be  expected  to  be  pro-poor.  Any  increase  in  the  pool  of  seafarers  (or \nmaintaining the present number) has a proportionally bigger impact on the poorer members of \nthe community.  \n \n56.  While most of the obvious benefits from the Project are in a monetary form, several \nnonmonetary benefits are apparent. The improvement in the standard of living or quality of life in \nthe outer islands is expected to counteract the pressure to migrate to Fongafale. Employment \nas a seafarer provides a combination of a tax-free income-earning opportunity that far exceeds \nthe remuneration from other work in Tuvalu, and the opportunity for relaxation time in their home \ncommunities between jobs. While employed, the seafarers are provided with full food, benefits, \nand lodgings. This represents a saving in consumption costs that they would otherwise incur if \nthey were not at sea. \n \n57.  The use of remittance income to purchase construction materials for building better \nquality housing and water collection and storage facilities in the outer islands has a positive \nimpact on the quality of life and health. The use of the money to pay for family members to \nattend school in the Fiji Islands allows the children of seafarers to receive a higher standard of \neducation than they would expect to receive in Tuvalu, increasing their prospects for personal \nadvancement and employment, while, at the same time, relieving the Government of some of its \nresponsibilities to provide social services. \n \n58.  According to the United Nations Development Programme, Tuvalu has the lowest per \ncapita GDP of US$1,157 and the lowest human development index among the Polynesian \ncountries. Fifty percent of the population has less than US$1 cash income per day. Using this \nmeasure of poverty (which is not strictly correct, since most families in Tuvalu have land and \naccess to fish), the level of poverty in the outer islands is three times higher than in Funafuti. \nThe disparity in net cash income between Funafuti and the outer islands reflects the relatively \nhigh incidence of government jobs in Funafuti, whereas job and business opportunities on the \nouter islands are much more limited. The more disadvantaged groups (the old, the very young, \nand women) are concentrated on the outer islands, reflecting emigration of younger workers to \n   \n \n ", "13 \nFunafuti and the overseas employment of almost half the men from the outer islands. Given this \nsituation, seafarer remittances clearly have a role to play in supporting the social and economic \nwelfare of the outer islands, where most of the seafarers come from. \n \n59.  The remittances are extremely important, but subject to global forces of supply and \ndemand for seafarers. Fluctuations in the total annual seafarer remittances in the last 5 years \nhave been considerable. Despite some dips in employment in the late 1990s, an increasing \ntrend is evident. In early 2000, a high of 514 seafarers were at sea (on 79 vessels). The current \nlevel is 470 (September 2001). The main threats to stable or growing overseas employment for \nTuvaluan seafarers include (i) competition from other countries, especially if maritime training \nquality in Tuvalu were to decline; and (ii) increasing incidence of seafarer alcohol abuse (and \nassociated dismissals). The Project is aimed directly at this vulnerability of Tuvaluan seafarers, \nby providing the facilities and capacity for better training, and ensuring that they have a \ncompetitive advantage for international job opportunities. \n \n60.  Seafarer remittances received in Tuvalu in 2000 totaled around A$4.7 million. Current \nindications are that this total will be higher in 2001 (at about A$6.3 million), reflecting the recent \nincrease in seafarer wages, the decreased value of the Australian dollar against the US dollar, \nand a relatively high level of employment. Analysis of the prorated distribution of seafarer \nremittances  on  an  island  basis  (reflecting  the  home  islands  of  Tuvaluan  seafarers)  was \nundertaken. The largest absolute amounts of seafarer remittance are earned by Nanumea-and \nFunafuti-based men, but, on a per capita basis, the greatest potential economic benefits of \nseafarer remittances will accrue to families based in Nanumea, Nui, Nukufetau, and Nukulaelae. \nThe potential per capita distribution of seafarer remittances to Nanumea over the next year is \nA$1,573, more than five times the per capita benefit to families with Funafuti listed as their \nhome island. Clearly, the outer islands have a dependence on the seafarer remittances and a \nhigher  potential  of  economic  benefit  from  them,  compared  with  Funafuti.  The  Project  is \nattempting, through the upgrading of TMTI, to secure these potential economic benefits to the \nouter islands. \n \n3.  Sexually Transmitted Diseases \n61.  HIV/AIDS is spreading fast in the Pacific region. In a country as dependent on overseas \nseafarers as Tuvalu, the consequences of even small numbers of HIV/AIDS positive cases \ncould be devastating in such a small population. Tuvalu diagnosed the first HIV positive case in \n1995 and 2 more cases up to 2001. However, in the month of January 2002, 6 cases were \ndiagnosed, and the trend is obviously on the rise. Seafarers make up 7 of the reported cases \nand this has caused great concern, not only in the Government, but also among the shipping \nagents. \n \n62.  Much stricter guidelines have now been introduced before individuals are approved for \noverseas seafarer employment with the German shipping agencies. The seafarers\u2019 medical \nfitness  certificate  now  includes  psychological  assessment,  the  medical  officer\u2019s \nrecommendation,  and  HIV/AIDS  tests.  While  the  HIV/AIDS  test  is  not  mandatory,  strong \nsuspicion will be raised if potential seafarers decline the test. The Government applies these \ntests to seafarers, scholarship students, and government and nongovernment workers.  \n \n63.  TOSU has received funding from the International Transport Workers Federation for its \nawareness program on drugs and alcohol abuse as well as HIV/AIDS. The program trains \ntrainers and the target is to have an HIV/AIDS mentor onboard each ship. In addition, SPC, with \nfunding from the Australian Agency for International Development, World Health Organization, \n  \n ", " 14 \n \n \n \nand Unites States Agency for International Development, established its HIV/AIDS project in \nlate 1990. The overall aim of this project is to strengthen the capacity of Pacific island countries \nand  territories  to  minimize  the  impact  of  HIV/AIDS  and  sexually  transmitted  diseases  by \nproviding support and TA to national programs. \n \n64.  Both programs are ongoing and other assistance agencies in Tuvalu have expressed \ninterest in participating in additional programs in the fight against the spread of HIV/AIDS. The \nlevel of awareness training, publication material, and special programs being implemented is \nquite intense and the absorptive capacity for this level of assistance is probably at its limit. \nTherefore, incorporation of HIV/AIDS activities in the Project is not warranted. \n \n4.  Environment \n65.  The environment classification of the Project is category B\u2014a project with environmental \nimpacts that are easily mitigated using established technologies and mitigating measures. The \ninitial environmental examination (IEE) was completed in September 2001 as part of the project \npreparatory TA. The IEE was prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment \nRequirements. The mitigation measures identified in the IEE are integrated in the engineering \ndesign and contract document. The Project will be implemented in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental Guidelines for Infrastructure Projects. The summary IEE is provided in Appendix \n8 and the complete IEE is part of Supplementary Appendix F. Several factors preclude any \nsignificant negative environmental impacts associated with the Project: (i) the small scale of the \nProject; (ii) absence of any significant sensitive terrestrial, coastal, and marine habitats in the \nproject area; and (iii) the fact that the Project essentially involves upgrading of facilities at an \nexisting site (the increase in land area of the structures on Amatuku is only 8%). \n \n66.  The project design incorporates sound environmental management principles, including \nminimal disturbance of the seabed or terrestrial overburden, minimal cutting of trees, minimizing \nthe land area of the Project by building up (rather than out), use of modular construction to \nminimize construction wastage, and use of solar power. The design features and specified good \nconstruction practices will be covenants of the contracts and will be monitored for compliance by \nthe PMU.  \n \nC.  Economic and Financial Analysis \n1.  Economic Analysis \n67.  The economic analysis of the Project for rehabilitating and upgrading TMTI was carried \nout following the normal benefit-cost analysis methodology based on the future with the Project \nminus the future without the Project, to indicate the net economic benefits to the Tuvalu \neconomy. Economic performance is measured by the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) \nand the economic net present value (ENPV) at the chosen discount rate of 12%. A sensitivity \nanalysis  was  then  applied,  testing  the  robustness  of  the  results  to  changes  in  the  basic \nassumptions. \n \n68.  The results of the base case, using the assumptions noted (para. 72), return an EIRR of \n18.15%. The ENPV at a discount rate of 12% is A$3.25 million. This indicates that the Project is \na worthwhile investment for Tuvalu from an economic perspective, as it comfortably exceeds the \nEIRR discount rate of 12%. \n \n   \n \n ", "15 \n69.  The New Zealand Maritime School is the most realistic overseas training institute to \ncompare with as it can accommodate the extra intake of trainees, no extra investment is needed \nby the school, its curriculum is similar to TMTI, it is not subject to political unacceptance, and its \nstanding with IMO is not in jeopardy. The analysis is based on a 50 week course, including 16 \nweeks in Tuvalu for sea training on the  Nivaga II. The annual fee per trainee, including \naccommodation and 2 round-trip airfares is about A$20,000 at the current exchange rate. On \nthis basis, the total cost for 90 trainees per year is A$1.8 million. \n \n70.  The annual cost is just a little less than the cost of sending the trainees to New Zealand. \nHowever, this calculation does not take the cultural and linguistic aspects into consideration. \nSending young people with only moderate English command and from isolated Pacific atolls \noverseas could be problematic. \n \n71.  The capital investment costs of the Project have been converted to their economic \nequivalent allowing for any transfer payments, taxes and duties, and the effects of inflation. The \nincidence of taxes and duties is very low for the project capital costs, as most construction items \nare imported duty free. The only significant tax is the 2.5% sales tax, which is assumed to apply \nto most capital costs. The economic costs of the Project indicate an overall conversion factor of \n0.968  for  the  project  base  costs  of  US$2.04  million.  A  constant  exchange  rate  of \nUS$1.0=A$1.76 has been used. \n \n72.  Some assumptions are common to the with-project and without-project situations: \n \n(i)  average working life of approximately 15 years represented by an annual attrition \nrate  of  7%  of  the  pool  of  seafarers  per  year  with  loss  due  to  retirement, \nsuspension, and ill health; \n \n(ii)  at any one time, 45% of the available pool of qualified and active seafarers are \nemployed; \n \n(iii)  the 470 seafarers employed in 2001 averaged monthly earnings of US$762 per \nmonth; and \n \n(iv)  an average of 75% of total earnings is remitted back to Tuvalu. \n \n73.  Cash flows over a project life of 25 years were analyzed for the two scenarios. The net \nannual benefits increase over time, reaching over A$3.84 million per year as the divergence \nbetween the size of the pool of available seafarers increases with time. In the with-project \nsituation, the available pool of seafarers is stable at around 1,000 (similar to the present \nnumbers), while, in the without-project situation, the pool of seafarers reduces by half over a \nperiod of 20 years as a result of the lower number of new seafarers trained each year. \n \n2.  Sensitivity Analysis \n74.  The sensitivity analysis shows that the Project is robust to changes in the capital costs \nand to the ongoing operation and maintenance costs for TMTI, but that it is sensitive to the \npercentage of seafarer earnings that are remitted back to Tuvalu. It will be important for TMTI to \nensure that full use is made of the upgraded facilities and that an increased number of new \nentrants are trained each year. \n \n  \n ", " 16 \n \n \n \n3.  Financial Analysis \n75.  Financial  and  economic  analyses  are  provided  in  Appendix  9  and  detailed  in \nSupplementary Appendix C. Only specific aspects of the analyses are presented here. \n \n76.  The basic annual costs of operating TMTI in the present state are estimated to be in the \norder of A$630,000 per year. This is for a total of 60 trainees and 12 staff. Training is also \nprovided for a number of seamen for refresher and upgrading courses, which is estimated to \nmake up 15% of the training activity. Funding of the direct operating costs is fully supported by \nthe Government, through scholarships provided to the 60 new trainees per year, plus an \nadditional subsidy to make up any shortfall in meeting operating costs. In the Government\u2019s \n2001 budget allocation, TMTI was allocated A$400,000 as scholarships for 60 new trainees \n(A$6,666 per head) and an additional A$232,000 as a subsidy from the European Union funds, \nmaking a total allocation of A$632,000. \n \n77.  The new capital expenditure proposed for upgrading TMTI has implications for the level \nof operating expenditure and increased maintenance requirements. Without the upgrading of its \nfacilities, TMTI will be unlikely to maintain its White List status, jeopardizing the continuing \nemployment of Tuvaluan seafarers, so capital expenditure must be incurred to upgrade the \nfacilities. In the future, the objective will be to provide adequate funding for maintenance to keep \nthe infrastructure in good condition and to avoid the need for periodic injections of capital to \ncatch up with deferred maintenance.  \n \n78.  With the new infrastructure, total annual maintenance is estimated to cost A$83,450 per \nyear (this includes maintenance for the extension of the office for MD at the main wharf on \nFongafale). This amount is considerably more than TMTI has allocated for maintenance in the \npast, and highlights the importance of adequate maintenance to ensure that the assets are kept \nin good condition over their full economic life. If well maintained, the buildings and houses \nshould last for 25 years or more. The design of the new facilities and buildings incorporates \ndurable and noncorrosive materials, such as wood, aluminum, and treated steel, which are \nresistant to deterioration and corrosion\u2014a problem in the salty atmosphere at Amatuku. While \nthe cost of more durable materials adds to the overall initial capital costs, it will reduce the future \nongoing maintenance requirements and ensure that the facilities function for their full planned \neconomic life. \n \n79.  In addition, costs for debt servicing will increase for TMTI because of the ADB loan. \nAlthough TMTI may not be required to service the debt directly, it can be factored into the costs \nof running the institution to indicate the total cost and the change from the present situation. For \nexample, the debt repayment obligation for the ADB loan, repayable over 24 years with a \nnominal interest rate of 1.5%, would involve an annual debt-servicing cost of around A$183,000 \nper year, following the end of the 8-year grace period. The interest of 1% during the grace \nperiod would cost A$33,000 per year during the first 8 years. MES has given assurance that the \nGovernment has agreed to  the concept of user fees. Under the associated TA, options for \nrecovering the costs of TMTI will be identified and evaluated. \n \nD.  Risks \n80.  Project implementation has few direct risks, although some risks pertain to the sector \nconcerned. These, and suggested strategies to manage risk, include the following: \n \n   \n \n ", "17 \n(i)  Frequent turnover of Government staff or people serving in temporary positions, \nwhile others are away on regional travel, presents a challenge to continuity in \ndialogue as the Project develops.  \n \n(ii)  Although TMTI is well on the way to full corporatization and greater autonomy, \nthe process with Shipping Services may be slower. The integrity of the Nivaga II \nand its availability for training TMTI trainees would benefit from the  separation of  \nShipping Services from MD, and the increased efficiency of these services. \n \n(iii)  Staff currently employed by TMTI may change. However, the upgrading of TMTI \nand improvement in living conditions on the island will probably be a significant \nincentive for all current staff to remain. \n \n(iv)  Poor weather may interfere with the construction schedule. This risk will be \nassumed by the contractors. \n \n(v)  The Australian dollar may strengthen against the US dollar, which would reduce \nthe purchasing power of the loan. \n \n(vi)  The Nivaga II may not be available for training (if it is out of commission or not \ncertified for passenger service). This is being addressed in the associated TA. \n \n(vii)  Global demand for deck and engine room ratings may decline over the next few \nyears, which would reduce employment opportunities for Tuvaluan seafarers. \nThe increase in alcohol-related dismissals exacerbates this potential problem. \nUpgrading TMTI and the quality of Tuvaluan seafarers will be positive steps in \naddressing  this  risk.  TOSU  is  providing  awareness  sessions  for  Tuvaluan \nseafarers to address the alcohol problem. \n \n(viii)  The incidence of HIV/AIDS in Tuvalu is increasing. Tuvaluan seafarers, like those \nelsewhere, are at high risk of HIV infection; the issue is more of a concern in \nTuvalu than elsewhere, since about half the male population of Tuvalu works \noverseas at some point.  \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n81.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal document: \n \n(i)  Counterpart funds. The Government will ensure that the Project is accorded \nhigh priority and that adequate funds are allocated for disbursement for project \nactivities beginning in 2002 and for subsequent years, and that procedures are in \nplace  for  timely  releases  of  funds  for  project  activities  throughout  Project \nimplementation. \n \n(ii)  TMTI management. The Borrower shall ensure that there is continuity in TMTI \nmanagement (chief executive officer, chief officer and chief engineer), during \nProject implementation, with qualifications relevant to the effective and efficient \n  \n ", " 18 \n \n \n \nadministration and management of TMTI, and with competency and certificate \nlevels, as necessary, to maintain TMTI\u2019s White List status with the IMO. \n \n(iii)  Benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  Government  will  ensure  that \nimplementation of the Project, and the overall benefits derived therefrom, are \nmonitored and evaluated on an annual basis in accordance with a program \nsatisfactory to ADB. \n \n(iv)  Environment. With respect to the infrastructure components of the Project, the \nGovernment will comply with all applicable national and local environmental laws, \ncomply with all applicable ADB environmental guidelines, and ensure that any \nadverse environmental impacts related to the construction and operation of the \nfacilities  under  the  Project  are  minimized  through  appropriate  mitigation \nmeasures.  \n \n(v)  Land. The Government will, at all times, continue to hold the land, rights in land, \nor leases required for the provision or improvement of the project facilities. \n \nB.  Condition for Loan Effectiveness \n82.  The Government will ensure that the management team of TMTI (chief executive officer, \nchief officer, chief engineer) is in place. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n83.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various currencies equivalent to \nSpecial Drawing Rights 1,394,000 to Tuvalu for the Maritime Training Project from ADB's \nSpecial Funds resources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in \nthe draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n                  TADAO CHINO \n                       President \n23 September 2002 \n   \n \n ", "       \nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  and Risks \n       \nGoal       \nTo contribute to the sustained livelihood  Ongoing contribution of seafarer  Use of the project benefit and   \nand well-being of the outer island  remittances to Tuvalu remains  monitoring evaluation of the \ncommunities where primarily the old, the  stable at A$6 million-8 million per  Island Development Program \nvery young, and women live  year, or increasing, over the next  survey facility to determine \n25 years, with measurable  socioeconomic changes in the \nimprovement in social and  Outer Islands \neconomic conditions in the outer   \nislands   Monitoring of Tuvalu Overseas \nSeafarer Union and National \nBank of Tuvalu data on seafarer \nemployment levels and annual \nremittances \nPurpose       \nTo ensure that Tuvalu Maritime Training  TMTI passes IMO external audit  IMO audit  Government ensures that recruitment of \nInstitute (TMTI) and Marine Department  prior to 2005 and remains    competent management staff at TMTI is not \n(MD) meets the standards and  accredited (White List) as a  The Secretariat of the Pacific  compromised  \nrequirements of the International Maritime  training institute to supply  Community (SPC) and crewing   \nOrganization (IMO) in order to continue to  seafarers for the international  agency inspections   \nprovide basic training and more  market   \nspecialized refresher and upgrade   \ncourses to young trainees and active \nseafarers \n \nOutputs       \n1.

Social Analysis \n \n1.  The social analysis of the proposed upgrading of the Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute \nhas 2 aspects:  \n(i)  the economic and social importance of Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute (TMTI) \nto the general economy of Tuvalu, and the outer islands in particular, which \nprovides  a  fundamental  justification  for  the  proposed  loan project (the \u201cdo \nnothing\u201d option would have very serious consequences for the whole of Tuvalu); \nand \n(ii)  the potential social impact (both disruptions and benefits) of the Project itself (the \nconstruction activities that are required to upgrade the TMTI facilities), on the \nstaff and trainees resident on Amatuku Islet. \n2.  The economy of Tuvalu is very much dependent on remittances of seafarers, most of \nwhom were trained at TMTI, and the ability of TMTI to provide the required basic training and \nrefresher courses in the future, at the standards set by the International Maritime Organization \n(IMO), is now critically dependent on the proposed upgrading project. The following details \nprovide evidence of the social importance of TMTI and the Tuvaluan seafarers to provide a \ncontext for the proposed loan and to inform the poverty impact analysis. \n3.  An abundance of data is now available on the overall economic situation in Tuvalu, \nprovided in the 1997 Economic Report for Tuvalu (Asian Development Bank [ADB]), the ADB \nCountry Assistance Plan (for 2001\u20132003), and the recent results of the Project Monitoring and \nEvaluation exercise (the ADB-supported Island Development Program). Relevant data from \nthese reports have been reworked and interpreted to highlight the link between TMTI, the \nseafarer remittances, and the economies of the outer islands\u2014the specific focus of this social \nanalysis. \nB.  Tuvaluan Seafarers and Their Potential Contribution to the Outer Islands \n4.  Most Tuvaluan seafarers come from the outer islands (almost 60%, with only 10% from \nFunafuti;  30%  of  Tuvaluan  seafarers  were  born  outside  Tuvalu.  Nanumea,  Nukufetau, \nNukulaelae, and Niutao especially have a very strong reliance on remittances for income. \nIncome from wages, salaries, and business (combined) does not equal the income provided by \nremittances. Clearly, the level of government service (and related job opportunities) and the \nextent of business opportunities are both limited on these outer islands. \n5.  Less than 15% of the income on any of the outer islands can be tied directly to resource-\nbased activity, such as fishing, farming, or production of handicrafts. With such limited scope for \nbusiness income, limited opportunities for wages and salaries, and an increasing demand for \nproducts  that  require  cash  (moving  away  from  a  subsistence  economy),  the  seafarer \nremittances are relied on to provide the products and commodities that must be purchased \nabroad, and to fund increasingly expensive services, such as electricity and good quality \neducation (usually outside Tuvalu). Remittances are allocated in 3 basic categories (i) food and \nother such consumables, (ii) support to social services (church and education), and (iii) what \ncan be considered luxury goods (high technology, energy consumptive goods, compared with \ntraditional materials and goods). With the exception of support to the church, most financial \nsupport provided by seafarers is directed at their specific families. Without tax revenue from \nseafarer remittances, the poorer groups in Tuvaluan society cannot be immediate beneficiaries \n   \n \n ", "  Appendix 7  35\nof seafaring activity, even though the Government subsidizes the training of seafarers, which \ncan be viewed as reinforcement of a preferential, or even elitist, benefit  \n6.  The data for shipment of cargo and movement of passengers between Funafuti and the \nouter islands suggest that the island groups are very similar. The central islands (Vaitupu, Nui, \nand  Nukufetau)  consistently  show  slightly  higher  volumes  per  capita  of  cargo  and  fuel \nshipments compared with the other island groups, but the overall range of cargo shipped per \ncapita for all the islands is only 0.04 to 0.08 cubic meters (m3) per month. The least amount of \ncargo shipped from Funafuti (on a per capita basis) is to Nukulaelae and Nuilakita. The amount \nof fuel shipped shows a similar small range per capita: 0.004-0.007 tons per capita per month, \nwith the highest volumes going to the Central Group. Both outgoing cargo and fuel shipments \nshowed slight increases in 2000 compared with 1999. This may reflect, to some extent, the \nincreased level of remittances in 2000, but this cannot be ascertained for sure. The highest level \nof  interisland  travel  per  capita  occurs  between  the  Southern  Group  of  islands  (mostly \nNukulaelae) and Funafuti. The least amount of travel per capita is evident in  the Northern \nGroup,  probably  reflecting  the  more  remote  location  of  these  islands  and  atolls.  Overall, \napproximately one in two people from the outer islands travel at least once per year between \ntheir home island and Funafuti. \n7.  According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Pacific Development \nReport (1999), Tuvalu has the lowest per capita gross domestic product (GDP) (US$1,157) and \nthe lowest human development index among the Polynesian countries. Fifty percent of the \npopulation has less than $I cash income per day.  Using this measure of poverty (which is not \nstrictly correct, since most families in Tuvalu have land and access to fish), the level of poverty \nin the outer islands is three times higher than in Funafuti. The disparity in net cash income \nbetween Funafuti and the outer islands reflects the relatively high incidence of government jobs \non Funafuti, whereas job and business opportunities on the outer islands are much more \nlimited. The more disadvantaged groups (the old, the very young, and women) are concentrated \non the outer islands, reflecting emigration of younger workers to Funafuti and the overseas \nemployment of almost half the men from the outer islands. \n8.  Land is at a premium throughout Tuvalu, with about 90% held by private landowners, so \narea for investment and expansion of services is limited. In 1996, the population density on \nFunafuti was 1,756 people per square kilometers, reflecting emigration from the outer islands, \nfurther splitting of family land area in Funafuti, and increase in household size. Population \ndensity in the outer islands is about one fifth to one quarter what it is in Funafuti. One of the \nmain concerns of the Government is to increase the welfare and level of economic activity in the \nouter islands, and at the same time reduce the pressures on land and services in Funafuti. \n9.  Several recent initiatives are addressing the disparities between Funafuti and the outer \nislands. In the first instance, the Falekaupule Trust Fund (FTF) has been set up, owned by the \neight island communities. The FTF is supported by the Island Development Program (IDP), \nwhich is funded by ADB. In the second instance, electricity is now available on all the islands, \nprovided by the Tuvalu Electricity Corporation, and backed up with solar power units and private \ngenerators. Community fisheries centers have been set up on three of the islands. In a recent \nsurvey (IDP, 2000), most outer islands noted an adequate level of water storage and supply \n(under most conditions), availability of flush and water seal toilets, and access to electricity. \n10.  Nevertheless, survey respondents noted many areas for improvement. The required \nimprovements, as seen by outer islanders, fall into the categories of public services and \ninfrastructure,  environment,  and  private  infrastructure.  Health,  education,  and  shipping \n  \n ", "36  Appendix 7 \ndeficiencies in the outer islands might best be handled by FTF projects, or government-funded \ninitiatives, where these require government policy support and strategic interventions that have \nthe most benefit per capita. The suggested improvements that might be funded by seafarers \nand their families include \n(i)  improve water supplies at the individual level, or supported as a community \ninitiative; \n(ii)  improve housing, which can be considered a private investment; \n(iii)  increase investment in business, assuming that demand is adequate for certain \ncommodities and services and competition can be ensured; \n(iv)  improve agriculture (perhaps improve technology or plant and animal husbandry \napproaches,  given  the  limited  land),  reducing  the  demand  for  imported, \nprocessed foods; \n(v)  improve environmental quality, not necessarily with cash, but could be seed-\nfunded as community-based initiatives; and \n(vi)  provide playgrounds, sports facilities, and markets: these could be funded or \nsupported by seafarers, and operated as community or private sector initiatives. \n11.  Although  seafarer  remittances  play  an  important  role  in  supporting  outer  island \ncommunities, and will continue to do so, the benefits provided by remittances, which are heavily \nsubsidized by government (with free basic training initially and no tax collected on subsequent \nincome), are not equitably distributed throughout the outer islands.  To pursue the policy of \nouter island improvements, the Government needs to consider how to capture some of the \nrevenue from seafaring and use it to address the needs of marginalized members of Tuvaluan \nsociety. \n \nC.  Poverty Impact \n12.  This section identifies the impact of the Project on the main stakeholders and the \ndistribution of the net benefits.  This has been carried out following ADB guidelines.1  \n13.  The  main  benefit  from  the  Project  is  that  it  will  maintain  the  pool  of  international \nseafarers and ensure that the earnings and level of remittance income from this group are at \nleast maintained at the current level. The without-project situation with the assumed closure of \nTMTI would result in a decline in the number of active seafarers and a reduction in overseas \nremittances over time. \n   \n1.  Distributional Effects \n14.  Table A7 summarizes the distribution of net economic benefits of the Project.  The \nfinancial project statement is from the point of view of TMTI.  As no fees are charged or costs \nrecovered from the trainees and seafarers, the training institute has no revenue and is totally \nsupported by the Government. The main economic benefit is the remittance income generated \nby the seafarers, which is used by the families and beneficiaries in the seafarers\u2019 communities. \nThe Project will result in the distribution of benefits to the communities, particularly in the outer \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2001.

Seafarers do not pay income tax on their overseas earnings and the incidence of indirect \ntaxation on the expenditure of the remittance income is negligible, as the main consumption \nitems of food, construction materials, church donations, and school fees do not attract customs \nduty. Therefore, the beneficiaries and their families stand to make a substantial gain from the \nProject at no financial cost.  In effect, the Project will result in a large transfer payment to the \nseafarers and their families.  While this is a fundamental and accepted aspect of the Tuvalu \neconomy, not all households receive benefit from remittance income, and households that do \nnot have a family member working as a seafarer will not be as well off.  Although some informal \nmechanisms will be used  to redistribute wealth in the outer island communities, through the \nchurch  and  social  conventions  for  example,  nevertheless  the  benefits  will  not  be  shared \nequitably by households.  The recovery of some of TMTI\u2019s training costs through a user pay \nsystem, the introduction of tax on overseas earnings, or a value-added tax on consumption, \nwould allow the Government to receive more revenue, which could be used to provide social \nservices to the portion of the community that would not share directly in the project benefits. \n \n2.  The Poverty Line   \n \n16.  According to UNDP Pacific Development Report 1999, Tuvalu shows the lowest per \ncapita  GDP  (US$1,157)  and  the  lowest  human  development  index  (0.583)  among  the \nPolynesian  countries.    In  addition,  the  income  distribution  is  uneven,  with  the  main  atoll, \nFunafuti, receiving a greater share.  Tuvalu has no specific poverty line, but overall 50% of the \npopulation have less that US$1.0 cash income per capita per day and most families rely on \nsubsistence activities from their land to support their households.  The 1994 household and \nincome expenditure survey recorded an average daily per capita income of US$2.4 per day on \nFunafuti and US$1.0 in the outer islands.  Furthermore, the percentage of the population with \nless than US$1.0 per day was higher in the outer islands (66.5%) than in Funafuti (21.6%), \nwhile goods are more expensive in the outer islands due to their remoteness and transport \ncosts.  Moreover the outer islands are where the most vulnerable groups are concentrated\u2014the \nold, the very young, and women. \n \n  \n ", "38  Appendix 7 \n3.  Number of Beneficiaries/Stakeholders \n17.  As a result of the Project, the pool of seafarers actively involved in overseas employment \nwill be maintained at the present level of 1,000, with around 45%, or 450, actually working \noverseas at any one time.  Without the Project, the pool of seafarers is expected to decline over \ntime, through attrition due to retirement and other factors, with the number of new seafarers \nbeing trained not sufficient to maintain the numbers.  After 25 years, the pool would be reduced \nto only 470.  \n \n18.  The pool of 1,000 seafarers represents about 43% of all Tuvalu males aged between 20 \nand 60 years; an estimated 60% of all households, or around 6,000 people, receive benefits \ndirectly from the remittance income earned by the seafarers.  In the absence of the Project, this \nwill reduce over time by at least 50%, thus about 30% of the households stand to benefit directly \nfrom the Project. \n \n4.  Impact of Benefits \n19.  The net increase in the level of remittance income due to the Project is estimated to total \nA$3 million by the end of the project life.  This is equivalent to A$1,000 per person. No \ninformation on the distribution of poor households is available for Tuvalu, but the impact of this \ndistribution is expected to be pro-poor, as households without the benefit of seafarer remittance \nincome will be worse off, so any increase in the pool of seafarers (or maintaining the present \nnumber) must have a proportionally bigger impact on the poorer members of the community. \n \n20.  While most of the obvious benefits from the Project are in a monetary form, several \nnonmonetary benefits are apparent. The improvement in the standard of living in the outer \nislands or quality of life must counteract the pressure to migrate to Funafuti and further afield. \nEmployment as a seafarer provides a combination of a tax-free, income-earning opportunity that \nfar  exceeds  the  remuneration  from  working  in  Tuvalu,  while  at  the  same  time  providing \nrelaxation time in their home communities between jobs.  While employed, the seafarers are \nprovided with full food and lodgings that represent a saving in consumption costs that they \nwould otherwise incur if they were not at sea.   \n \n21.  The use of remittance income to purchase construction materials for building better \nquality housing and water collection and storage facilities in the outer islands has a positive \nimpact on the quality of life and health.  The use of the money to pay for school fees for family \nmembers to attend school in the Fiji Islands allows their children to receive a higher standard of \neducation than they would expect to receive in Tuvalu, increasing their prospects for personal \nadvancement and employment, while at the same time relieving government of some of its \nresponsibilities  to  provide  social  services.  More  information  about  the  use  and  impact  of \nseafarer remittances is provided in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n   \n \n ", "  Appendix 8  39\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \nA.  Introduction \n1.  The  proposed  Project  has  undergone  a  fairly  exhaustive  environmental  screening \nprocess, which involved site visits; consultations with project stakeholders and beneficiaries; \nreview of documentation, charts, and photographs; and collaborative environmental design with \nthe project engineer. The process has been sufficient to determine all possible interactions \nbetween the Project and the environment at the site.  \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n2.  Detailed description of the Project is given in paras 20 to 23 of the main text of this \nreport. \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n1.  Physical Resources \n \n3.  There project has two locations: TMTI on Amatuku Island, where 90% of the project \nactivity will be located, and the existing Marine Department offices at the main wharf on \nFongafale. Amatuku Island is located in the northeast section of Funafuti Atoll, about 800 \nmeters northwest of the tip of Fongafale, the largest island in Funafuti Atoll. The island is about \n1 kilometer long by 200 meters (m) wide (at the widest point) and only 0.1 square kilometers \n(km2) in area. Most of the island is only about 100 m wide and only about 1.5\u20132 m above sea \nlevel. The highest point is only 3 m above sea level. The lowest point of the island is in the \ncenter; this area occasionally floods during spring tides and after a storm surge, which forces \nseawater  to  percolate  through  the  coral  rubble  fringes  around  the  island.  The  island  is \ncomposed  of  a  hard  accreted  coral  pavement  or  platform,  with  coral  rubble  and  sand \noverburden. The ocean side of the island is marked by a steep storm berm (about 3 m high) \nalong a coral boulder and rubble beach, whereas the lagoon side is a more stable coral rubble \nbeach, with a few sandy pocket beaches, most notably at the southwest tip of the island. \n \n4.  The freshwater aquifer on Amatuku is negligible and all freshwater requirements must be \nmet by rainwater collection. The persistent winds at Amatuku Island and the sea spray from the \nocean side create a corrosive environment on the island. \n \n5.  The blasting and excavation of about 10,000 square meters (m2) of coral reef and flat by \nthe Americans during the war has resulted in some erosion of the rubble beach about 50 m \nnorth of the existing wharf and about 100 m of shore south of the wharf. The latter area has \nbeen protected with gabion. With the exception of the erosion on the lagoon side, induced by \nthe reef blasting, most of the observed erosion at the tips and on the ocean side is part of the \nnormal dynamic process of a small coral island (motu). \n \n6.  Amatuku Island is completely surrounded by fringing reef, with the exception of the area \ncleared off the wharf. This area is characterized by predominantly sand, some coral rubble, and \na few coral patches. Beyond the fringing reef on the lagoon side, water depths are typically 20\u2013\n30 m within 1\u20132 km of shore. On the ocean side, water depths drop off very suddenly. Maximum \ntidal range in Funafuti is about 2 m. Water quality at Amatuku Island is very good, as the water \nexchange over the reef rim north and south of the island is considerable during high tide. \n  \n ", "4 0  Appendix 8 \n7.  The location for the shipping service office extension is the wharf area on Fongafale. \nThis area has no distinctive physical features, having been built up over the last 20 years. \n \n  2.  Ecological Resources \n \n8.  Amatuku Island is quite heavily vegetated compared with other islands in Funafuti Atoll. \nForest cover is estimated at 80%. Amatuku Island has no mangrove trees. \n \n9.  The only birds which might nest on Amatuku are the white tern and the black-naped tern. \nThe only terrestrial animals that are known to live on Amatuku Island are lizards. Pigs are kept \nin pens at the northern tip of the island. \n \n10.  The island is surrounded by a fringing reef, except in the area near the wharf. Live coral \ncover in the rubble areas near the wharf is only about 5%. The reef flat on the lagoon side is \nabout 100 m wide and defined by a narrow reef slope at about 5 m water depth. On the ocean \nside, the reef, being much more exposed, is characterized by a spur-and-groove formation. The \nreef flat on the lagoon side is not that productive, with only a few small coral patches. \n \n  3.  Human and Economic Development and Quality of Life Issues \n \n11.  The situation on Amatuku Island, being dedicated to specialized postsecondary training, \nis artificial, compared with all the other islands in Tuvalu, and standard descriptions of human \nand economic development do not apply. All residents are either salaried and provided for, or \nfully subsidized by the Government as trainees, and also provided for. \n \n12.  The land occupied by TMTI is on long-term government lease from private landowners. \nNo apparent issues are related to the lease. The southern end of Amatuku Island (about 100 m \nlong) is still privately held and the motu immediately to the north is also in private hands. \n \n13.  At the other project location, the Marine Department located at the main wharf, office \nconditions can be described as cramped, dark, hot, and not at all suited to effective and \nproductive  work.  Despite  these  conditions,  the  port  and  shipping  services  for  Tuvalu  are \ndelivered. The proposed upgrading of these offices will greatly enhance working conditions for \nshipping service staff. \n \nD.        Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n14.  The  Project  will  only  increase  the  building  footprints  (land  area  occupied  by  the \nbuildings) of the residential and training areas by 8%. The buildings will be built within the \nexisting compound of the training center. No additional land lease will be required. Four coconut \npalm trees will be cut down. The office extension of the Marine Department will use the present \nlocation and will involved refurbishment of the existing office space and addition of a second \nstory extension. The wharf will be built in a sandy area at least 40 m from the nearest reef flat. \n \n15.  During construction the residents and students will be inconvenienced by the noise from \nthe construction activities and may have to move around the existing and completed facilities for \nsafety reasons especially when the additional storys are built. To minimize the inconvenience, \nthe construction activities are staged over a  2-year period allowing completion and use of a \nbuilding prior to renovation of the next building.  This problem is short term and temporary. Once \nthe rehabilitation is completed, the residents and students will have better training facilities, and \nutilities  such  as  water  supply,  toilets,  electricity,  and  communications.  The  existing  septic \n   \n \n ", "  Appendix 8  41\nsystems will be expanded. Part of the electricity supply will use solar cells. With the additional \nboarding facilities, trainees and staff will no longer have to commute  between Amatuku and \nFongafale. During reconstruction of the wharf facilities, temporary boat loading and unloading \nfacilities will be established. The temporary facilities are expected to be in use for 3 to 4 months. \nConstruction crew and laborers will be  recruited from the local population. The construction \ncrew is estimated to range from 20 to 30 persons. Waste materials from the construction site as \nwell as demolition debris will be disposed of at the landfill site in Fongafale. \n \n16.  The  environmental  impacts  during  operation  of  the  facilities  are  mostly  positive, \nspecifically on improved safety and health conditions in the houses, dormitories, and training \nfacilities.  \n \nE.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program \n \n17.  No specific environmental monitoring program has been designed, since the engineering \ndesign  and  the  proposed  construction  techniques  and  implementation  schedule  will  be \ncontractual  requirements  of  the  successful  contract  bidder.  The  independent  consulting \nengineer  will  ensure,  on  behalf  of  the  Government,  that  all  environmental  management \ncovenants are adhered to. Upon completion of the construction activities, TMTI will assume full \nresponsibility for operation of the facilities on Amatuku Island, and will adhere to the proposed \nenvironmental management practices noted in this document (Supplementary Appendix E). \n \nF.  Conclusions \n \n18.  This initial environmental examination has determined that the proposed upgrading of \nTMTI, and extension of shipping services offices, can be constructed and operated with no \nsignificant  negative  environmental  and  social  impacts,  and  that  environmental  and  social \nbenefits should result from proper operation of the facilities. This Project can be classified as \nCategory B (relatively small scale), not requiring an environmental impact assessment. Subject \nto the implementation of specified mitigation measures, the Project should be able to proceed \nwithout any significant negative effects. \n \n \n  \n ", "42 Appendix 9 \nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSES \n \nA.  General Assumptions  \n \n1.  Project costs are estimated based on the prices current in October 2001 and are \nexpressed in A$, the currency used in Tuvalu, but have been adjusted to the most updated US$ \nexchange rate of US$1.0 = A$1.76. The appreciation of the Australian dollar over the American \ndollar during the first half of 2002 naturally has implications for the project costs, but the \nsufficient contingencies should counter any shortfall. The total project baseline cost is estimated \nat about US$2.1 million. The allowance for price contingencies over the 3-year implementation \nperiod is 2.4% for foreign costs and 2.5% for local costs per year. Physical contingencies vary \nfrom 5.0% to 27.5% for the various items of infrastructure and equipment according to the \ndegree of uncertainty in estimating their costs. Total estimated Project cost, including physical \nand price contingencies and interest and commitment charges, is US$2.3 million. The Project \nwill be implemented over 24 months.   \n \n2.  Currently, Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute (TMTI) conducts three classes of maritime \ntraining; this is expected to continue in the future. \n \n(i)  A  1-year  residential  basic  training  course  is  available  for  new  entrants  before \nemployment at sea.  Currently TMTI takes in 60 trainees per year in three intakes of 20; \nnormally 50 complete the course and graduate.  Four months is spent undergoing sea \ntraining on the Nivaga II. \n \n(ii)  Upgrade courses of 3 weeks duration are provided for basic fire fighting, safety, and sea \nsurvival training.  This course is normally provided once during the career of a seafarer \nwithin the first 2 to 3 years of employment. The upgrade allows the seafarers to move up \nthe pay scale and receive an immediate increase in pay.   \n \n(iii)  Revalidation and refresher course are available for seafarers. Each seafarer is required \nto revalidate his certificate every 5 years to maintain his employment status under the \nConvention on Standards of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping of 1995 (STCW \n95). The course normally lasts 1 week and involves fire fighting, sea safety and tanker \nskills, with the objective to refresh the seafarers skills allowing for changes in technology \nand  competency  requirements.  On  average,  around  150\u2013200  seafarers  require \nrevalidation per year. \n \n3.  The  main  benefit  from  the  Project  is  that  it  will  allow  TMTI  to  continue  to  be  an \naccredited maritime training institution maintaining its White List status. Sometime before 2005, \nthe International Maritime Organization (IMO) will conduct its external audit of all maritime \nschools around the world. TMTI's accreditation to the White List was primarily based on a desk \nappraisal conducted by TMTI. A regional inspection by the maritime division of the Secretariat of \nthe Pacific Community (SPC) was carried out in May 2002. TMTI must be seen as addressing \nits teaching and training deficiencies right now to show IMO that its external inspection should \nbe conducted at the appropriate time. The economic benefits from the Project can be expressed \nas the difference in remittances from a constant pool of 1,000 seafarers, of which 45% are \nactive, over a declining number in the pool because fewer Tuvaluans can be trained overseas. \nIn this case, the with-project situation is the continuing operation of TMTI with an increase in the \nnumber of trainees that graduate each year and the provision of upgrading and revalidation \ncourse to the pool of 1,000 active seafarers. The without-project situation is that TMTI loses its \nWhite List status, is no longer an accredited maritime training institute and has to close down. \n   \n \n ", "  Appendix 9  43\nThe Government would then be faced with having to send its young men to a suitable training \ninstitution overseas. Upgrade and revalidation short courses would also have to be conducted \noverseas. The result would be that a reduced number of Tuvaluans would be trained and that \nthe pool of trained seafarers would reduce over time, as they retire or give up employment as \nseafarers, with a consequent reduction in the amount of their earnings remitted back to Tuvalu. \n \nB.  Economic Analysis \n \n4.  The economic analysis of the Project for the rehabilitation and upgrade of TMTI has \nbeen carried out following the normal benefit-cost analysis methodology based on the with-\nproject minus without-project scenario to indicate the net economic benefits to the Tuvalu \neconomy  over  the  life-span  of  the  Project,  which  is  assumed  to  be  25  years.  Economic \nperformance is measured by the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) and the economic net \npresent value at the chosen discount rate of 12%. A sensitivity analysis is applied to test the \nrobustness of the results to changes in the basic assumptions. \n \n5.  The capital investment costs are converted to their economic equivalent allowing for any \ntransfer payments, taxes and duties, and the effects of inflation. The incidence of taxes and \nduties is very low for the project capital costs, as most construction items are imported duty free. \nThe only significant tax is the 2.5% sales tax, which is assumed to apply to most capital costs. \nThe economic costs of the Project, produced as an output from COSTAB, indicate an overall \nconversion factor of 0.968 for the project baseline costs of US$2.04 million.  \n \n6.  A least-cost analysis was carried out to compare the costs with a realistic overseas \ntraining institution. In this analysis, only New Zealand has been compared as the only realistic \nalternative. The training school in Kiribati is political unacceptable to the Government of Tuvalu. \nThe maritime training college in The Fiji Islands has also been left out of the analysis, as it \nwould require considerable investment to accept additional seafarers. The maritime training \nschool  in  Madang,  Papua  New  Guinea,  only  caters  for  education  at  officer  level.  The \nPhilippines, with the most maritime training institutes in the region, has also been discounted as \nan option, as the number of training schools not meeting, or will not be able to meet the IMO \nstandards, are expected to be considerable and hence the country have much less capacity to \naccept trainees from abroad. The opportunity cost of the trainees time while receiving their \ntraining is assumed to be zero as employment opportunities for young men in Tuvalu are very \nlimited. \n  \n7.

The main benefit from the Project is the maintenance of the level of remittance income at \nmore or less the current level, compared with the without-project situation where the number of \nseafarers will decrease over time with a corresponding reduction in their remittances. In the \nwith-project situation, the available pool of seafarers is stable at around 1,000, similar to the \npresent numbers, while in the without-project situation the pool of seafarers reduces by half over \n20 years as a result of the lower number of new seafarers trained each year. Consequently, net \neconomic benefits will increase over time to reach A$3.8 million per year after 25 years, as the \ndivergence between the size of the pool of available seafarers increases with time. An average \nmonthly wage of US$762 for a Tuvaluan seafarer has been used based on the records from the \nGerman shipping agents based in Tuvalu. These same records show that on average 75% of \nthese wages are remitted back to Tuvalu. \n \n9.  The results of the base case, using the assumptions noted above returns an EIRR of \n18.15%.  The economic net present value at a discount rate of 12% is A$3.25 million. This \n   \n \n ", "  Appendix 9  45\nindicates that the Project is a worthwhile investment for Tuvalu from an economic perspective, \nas it exceeds the EIRR hurdle of 12%.

The sensitivity analysis shows that the Project is robust, the worst case scenario still \ngives an EIRR of 14.33%. The percentage of seafarer earnings that are remitted back to Tuvalu \nis an important variable. It will be important for TMTI to ensure that full use is made of the \nupgraded facilities and that the expected number of new entrants are trained each year. \n \nC.  Financial Analysis \n \nC.  Impact of Increased Trainee Numbers \n12.  In assessing the impact of the proposed upgrading program on the annual operating \nexpenditure, two situations were investigated. The first is the continuation of the same number \nof new entrants as at present (60 trainees full time per year for their pre-sea training), plus 150 \ntrained seafarers for short-term refresher courses. The second situation or scenario investigated \nis an increase in new entrants by 50% to a total of 90 trainees per year, plus the same quota of \n150  seafarers  attending  refresher  courses  (demand-supply  analysis  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix D). \n \nD.  Maintenance at Present Levels of Trainee Numbers \n13.  The  main  impact  on  the  operating  budget  will  be  the  implication  of  increased \nmaintenance arising from the capital expenditure for rehabilitation and upgrading to ensure that \nthe new infrastructure and equipment is kept in good condition. It can also be assumed that the \nstaffing levels will be maintained at the required level to meet the training needs, which implies \nthat any current vacancies are filled, such as the position for a remedial English teacher, and \nthat consumable materials for teaching are kept up to date and replenished as needed.  For this \nscenario,  the  proposed  budget  for  2001  that  was  prepared  by  TMTI  indicates  the likely \nexpenditure and funding required, with the addition of increased maintenance. Under this \n   \n \n ", "  Appendix 9  47\nscenario the annual budget for TMTI will be about A$450,000, plus whatever extra salary \npackage top-ups are required for the contracted expatriate staff. \n \nE.  Increased Number of Trainees \n14.  Increasing the number of new trainees by 50% from the present 60 per year to 90 will \nincrease the operating costs of TMTI, through the increase in teaching resources and staff and \nthe direct cost of the residential trainees\u2014food, uniforms, and allowances.  An analysis of the \ncurrent operating expenses for TMTI and the projected budget for 2002 indicates that the full \ncomplement of teaching staff costs (with no vacant positions) would cost A$107,000 per year, \nwhile  the  other  training  expenses  cost  a  total  of  A$102,000,  allowing  for  food,  clothing, \nallowances, and materials, making a total of A$209,000.  \n \n15.  The average cost per trainee (the direct training costs that are related to the number of \ntrainees) is A$3,483 per trainee per year. The present staff complement at full strength, with the \naddition of one more marine instructor, is considered to be an adequate teaching resource to \ntrain the increased number of 90 trainees. Adding one more instructor would increase the \nteaching staff costs to an estimated A$117,000 per year. The other costs (rations, uniforms, \nmaterials, etc.) could be expected to increase in direct proportion to the current costs by 50%. \nConsequently, direct training costs would increase to A$270,000 per year. Combined with the \nother cost items, the overall budget for TMTI with the increased number of trainees would \nincrease to A$499,200. \n \n16.  The increased number of trainees would increase the basic operating costs of TMTI to \nalmost A$500,000 per year, compared with the comparable cost of around A$400,000 per year \nin the present situation. \n \n17.  In addition, costs for debt servicing will increase for TMTI because of the ADB loan. \nAlthough TMTI may not be required to service the debt directly, it can be factored into the costs \nof running the institution to indicate the total cost and the change from the present situation. For \nexample, the debt repayment obligation for the ADB US$1.85 million loan (A$3.3 million) \nrepayable over 24 years with a nominal interest rate of 1.5%, would involve an annual debt-\nservicing  cost  of  A$175,000  per  year  following  the  end  of  the  8-year grace period. The \ncommitment fee of 1% during the grace period would cost around A$33,000 per year during the \nfirst 8 years. \n \n18.  The other important issue is the support for the top-up of the employment package for \nthe expatriate staff, particularly for the Captain Superintendent position, which is currently being \nfunded by the New Zealand Overseas Development Assistance program. New Zealand is not \ncommitted to continue to fund this position indefinitely, and alternative sources of finding will \nprobably be required to continue to fund this position at the present level of support. The \nsituation with the other two positions, which are staffed by expatriates, is more secure as the \nchief officer position is filled by the employment agencies and the chief engineer position is \nsupported internally by TMTI. Ideally, TMTI should be able to fund its staff complement without \nhaving to rely on external assistance. \n \nF.  Maintenance Costs \n19.  The new capital expenditure proposed for upgrading TMTI has implications for the level \nof operating expenditure and increased maintenance requirements. Without the upgrading of its \nfacilities, TMTI will be unlikely to be able to maintain its White List status, jeopardizing the \n  \n ", "48 Appendix 9 \ncontinuing  employment  of  Tuvaluan  seafarers;  so,  the  only  option  is  to  incur  the  capital \nexpenditure for upgrading the facilities. In the future, the objective will be to allocate sufficient \nfunds to maintenance to keep the infrastructure in good condition and avoid the need for \nperiodic injections of capital to catch up with deferred maintenance. The proposed capital \nexpenditure budget of US$2.3 million (A$4 million), which will be mostly made up of buildings \nand housing, will require TMTI to commit to a more realistic maintenance program to maintain \nthe new infrastructure.  \n \n20.  Total  annual  maintenance  is  estimated  to  be  US$80,000  per  year,  including \nmaintenance for the extension of the office for the marine department at the main wharf. This is \nconsiderably more than TMTI has allocated for maintenance in the past, and highlights the \nimportance of adequate maintenance to ensure that the assets are maintained in good condition \nover their full economic life. If well maintained, the buildings and houses should last for 25 years \nor more. The order of maintenance expenditure indicated in the table will probably not be \nrequired every year, especially while the facilities are new, but an important issue for the \noperation of the institute is that sufficient funds should be available for maintenance when \nneeded. The design of the new facilities and buildings incorporates durable and noncorrosive \nmaterials such as wood, aluminium, and treated steel that is resistant to deterioration through \nexposure to salt air in the very corrosive environment of Amatuku where TMTI is situated. While \nthe cost of more durable materials adds to the initial capital costs, it will reduce the future \nongoing maintenance requirements, and ensure that the facilities function for their full planned \neconomic life. \n  \n21.  TMTI has recently proposed the introduction of a user-pay system for its training and \nespecially for its revalidation courses. The Government has in principle agreed to such a system \nbeing introduced. TMTI is expected to be the first institution to introduce the user-pay system in \n2003.  \n \n   \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20020925165803", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 4.0 for Windows", "ModDate": "D:20021018102937+08'00'"}}
