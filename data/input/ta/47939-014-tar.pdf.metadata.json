The provision of technical assistance (TA) to AccessBank Tajikistan (ABTJ) supports an \nanticipated  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  investment  in  Tajikistan\u2019s  finance  sector. \nSupporting private sector development and facilitating access to finance is one of the three \ndevelopment  goals  to  be  achieved  by  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  2010\u20132014  for \nTajikistan. The TA would constitute ADB\u2019s first nonsovereign investment in the country. On 21\u2013\n27 November 2013, ADB fielded a mission to Tajikistan and agreed with ABTJ, the targeted \ninvestee,  and  its  shareholders  on  the  design,  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation \narrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference of the TA. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  During 2007\u20132011, Tajikistan made substantial progress in per capita income growth of \nnearly 17% per annum; however, it remains one of the poorest countries in Central Asia with a \nper capita income of only $962 in the first quarter of 2013. Poverty remains widespread with a \nheadcount ratio of 46.7% (2009). In rural areas, where more than 70% of the 8.0 million Tajiks \nlive, poverty exceeds 50%.  \n \n3.   In 2011, trade and services, the most important economic sectors, contributed about  \n60% to value addition; agriculture and industry (including manufacturing) remain significant, \neach contributing 20%. The services sector has been the most dynamic with a compounded \nannual growth rate of 14.4% (2007\u20132011), outpacing agriculture (6.3%) and industry (1.7%) \nduring the same period. The lower growth of agricultural value added points to the country\u2019s low \nproductivity  and  less  favorable  income  growth  for  the  rural  population.  Tajikistan  draws \nsubstantial  benefits  from  cross-border  remittances  of  1.5  million  workers  in  the  Russian \nFederation. Remittance volumes have more than doubled since 2007 to $3.6 billion in 2012, \nequivalent to 47% of gross domestic product. The financial crisis of 2008\u20132009 weakened the \nTajik economy until its recovery began in 2011. \n \n4.  The  private  sector  has  important  potential  to  contribute  to  income  generation  and \nemployment.  However,  a  survey  of  entrepreneurs  in  Tajikistan,  conducted  by  the  World \nEconomic Forum, rates access to finance, taxation, and corruption as the most challenging \nfactors  impeding  business  growth.2 Micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (MSMEs) \naccount for 33% of total employment; half is in agriculture. Microfinance institutions (MFIs) and \ndonors via banks are the main providers of finance for microenterprises, smallholder farmers, \nand agricultural businesses.  \n \n5.  Tajikistan\u2019s finance sector has been exposed to banking crises in the post-Soviet period, \nwhich have weakened public confidence. Limited central bank independence from government \nhas undermined financial intermediation progress, which is essential for economic growth. The \nratio of bank assets to gross domestic product indicates low financial depth at only 27.6% \n(2011), far below other transition economies. In Tajikistan, only about 16% of households have \naccess  to  formal  financial  services.  In  the  absence  of  competition,  intermediation  spreads \nbetween lending and deposit rates were as a high as 18% in 2010. Similar to other transition \neconomies, deposit mobilization by the Tajikistan financial system is weak and highly dollarized \nas indicated by a high loan-to-deposit ratio of 127% (first quarter 2013); about 70% of deposits \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 24 December 2013. \n2  World Economic Forum. 2012. Global Competitiveness Report 2012-2013. Geneva. \n ", "2 \nand 62% of loans are in hard currencies. This implies a high foreign exchange-induced credit \nrisk for borrowers of financial institutions. \n \n6.  The finance sector includes 16 commercial banks, one nonbank, and 127 MFIs. With \nonly  301  branches,  the  sector\u2019s  reach  is  weak.  The  absence  of  skilled  bankers  and  the \npresence  of  a  culture  based  on  family  loyalty  rather  corporate  work  ethics  is  a  serious \nbottleneck that constrains the industry. Many of the banks do not have an MSME customer \norientation, and most of the MFIs do not appear to have the strength, investors, and know-how \nto grow into sustainable businesses. Individuals who exercise strong control over their business \ndominate many of the smaller MFIs.  \n \n7.  Although  MFIs  have  made  considerable  efforts  to  serve  poor  households  and \nbusinesses in  Tajikistan  and  have  contributed to  considerable  growth  of  microfinance,  the \noverall significance of their reach is still limited. MFI growth has been facilitated mainly by donor \nfunding,  which  is  expected  to  continue  for  some  time  in  the  absence  of  strong  deposit \nmobilization.  Only  three  member  banks  and  15  MFIs  registered  with  the  Association  of \nMicrofinance Organizations of Tajikistan (AMFOT) had more than 1,000 borrowing clients as of \nMarch 2013. The finance sector had $1,400 million equivalent of outstanding loans (first quarter \n2013); of these banks had 81.3% and AMFOT member MFIs 18.7%.  \n \n8.  Demand for micro and small business loans in urban and rural areas is growing, partly \nbuoyed by the substantial flow of remittances from out-of-country workers, which stimulates \nprivate demand. However, local commercial banks remain weak, having suffered from the \n2008\u20132009  crisis,  and  display  continued  refinancing  and  liquidity  problems  together  with \nworrying asset quality, which constrain their ability to serve the growing demand for MSME \nlending. Improving access to finance for entrepreneurs along with healthy competition among \nbanks and MFIs is essential to improve access and financing conditions for clients, whose \ninvestments will support job creation and retention and offer alternatives to migration to cities \nand internationally, while reducing poverty in the regions.  \n \n9.  Of the existing financial institutions, only a few banks and MFIs will achieve the financial \nstrength to become commercially oriented and lasting service providers for local communities. \nUnfavorable ownership and governance in a business environment characterized by integrity \nissues further reduce the number of suitable financial institutions to provide services that are fair \nand responsible to their customers, and the necessary assurance to depositors. The greenfield \nbanking approach is an option for providing lasting financial services to low-income customers; \nit  has  been  successfully  tested  in  several  post-conflict  economies.  This  approach  entails \ncreating a financial institution, in most cases a bank owned by a technology and knowledge \nprovider, in association with strong investors, in most cases international financial institutions \n(IFIs). The investors share a long-term vision of building a strong, profitable financial institution, \nand  exercise  influence  to  promote  internal  and  external  governance  best  practices  and \nadherence to international industry standards, such as customer protection and social and \nenvironmental  responsibility.  High-quality  selection  and  training  of  staff  and  management; \nstrong  internal  rules  for  integrity  and  responsibility  toward  customers,  associated  with  no \ntolerance for corruption; and resources to weather crises that may adversely affect a greenfield \nfinancial institution during its buildup period, are essential components of the approach. \n \n10.  The TA is an integral part of an anticipated ADB investment that includes an equity \ninvestment and a loan to ABTJ. ABTJ was established as a greenfield bank in April 2010 and \ncurrently services over 7,000 customers in six branches with an average loan size of about \n$4,500. Since the receipt of a deposit license in late 2012, the bank is focusing on deposit \n ", "3 \n \nmobilization from small savers and the lower-income population. Access Microfinance Holding \nAktiengesellschaft, Berlin (AMH) owns 63.4% of the shares of ABTJ; the International Finance \nCorporation and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development each own 13.7%; and \nKfW owns 9.1%. AMH is owned by its strategic investor and knowledge provider Luso Financial \nSystems GmbH (LFS) with 14.2%; and LFS staff through Micro Assets (Berlin) with 4.5% of \nshares;  CDC  Group  (United  Kingdom),  European  Investment  Bank,  International  Finance \nCorporation,  KfW  (Germany),  and  Omidyar  Tufts,  each  with  14.2%;  and  Financierings-\nMaatschappij voor Ontwikkelingslanden N.V. (Netherlands) with 10% of the shares.3 ABTJ\u2019s \nhighly reputable owners make the bank an excellent target for investment to improve access to \nfinance for low-income households and small and micro businesses. \n \n11.  The TA is needed to test and train employees in a rigorous manner to build capacity \nwithin service teams in branches. This may take up to 2 years per branch. ABTJ shareholders \nhave so far provided critical TA grant funding to support the bank\u2019s build-up phase. Further TA \nneeds are substantial, especially for managing expansion, supporting product development, and \nbuilding branch capacity in lending and deposit taking to transform ABTJ into a leading bank in \na challenging business environment. As the history of the Access Microfinance bank network, in \ngeneral,  and  of  ABTJ,  in  particular,  concretely  shows,  training  efforts  directly  translate  to \nimproved staff productivity, thus leading to more clients accessed and serviced, which has a \ndirect development and income impact In Tajikistan and a demonstration effect to the sector. \n \n12.  ABTJ now plans to expand its client outreach to borrowers and depositors in rural areas \nthrough additional branches, providing new agricultural financing products to farmers, as well as \nlending to MSMEs. ABTJ development plans for 2014\u20132018 include (i) developing an additional \n17 branches and outlets (of which 14 will be in regions outside the capital); (ii) employing  \n300 additional staff (of which 260 will be in the regions); (iii) introducing several products in \ncredit and banking services departments; and (iv) increasing the outstanding loan portfolio from \nthe current $32 million to $135 million (of which up to $11 million will be agricultural loans), to \ngrow total deposits from $1 million currently to $28 million, and to maintain profitability and earn  \n$3.5 million by the end of 2017. Along with this business growth, ABTJ would provide access to \nfinance to 20,000 additional borrowers, most of whom are in the regions.  \n \n13.  ABTJ has been selected as a partner because of its high potential for quality growth and \noutreach  to  low-income,  and  micro  and  small  business  customers  in  rural  areas;  its  solid \ngovernance  structure  and  internal  controls  supported  by  its  IFI  and  strategic  investor \nshareholders;  and  its  active  pursuit  of  responsible  finance  principles  aligned  with  modern \nconsumer rights. ABTJ actively pursues equal opportunity employment and access to financial \nservices. Currently, more than 2,300 clients and 36% of its employees, including its chief \nexecutive officer, are female. AMH\u00b4s experience in building sustainable greenfield banks in \nfragile economic environments provides important confidence in the selection of ABTJ. The TA \nwill have a demonstration effect in strengthening banking institutions in the nascent finance \nsector. \n \n14.  Consistent with the Tajikistan country partnership strategy and Tajikistan\u2019s long-term \nnational  development  strategy,  2006\u20132015,  the  TA,  as  part  of  an  overall  ADB  investment \npackage, aims to provide a model for sustainable financial inclusion of Tajikistan\u2019s farmers and \nprivate enterprises with a special focus on rural areas. This access to financial services in \n                                                 \n3  AMH, a holding company, currently owns seven greenfield banks in five African countries (Liberia, Madagascar, \nNigeria, Tanzania, and Zambia) as well as in two Central Asian countries (Azerbaijan and Tajikistan). LFS provides \nadvisory services to those entities through management contracts. \n ", "4 \nunderserved regions and economic sectors will provide support for inclusive growth through \nemployment  and  income  generation  in  underdeveloped  local  communities.  The  TA  and \nproposed investment will be closely coordinated with ADB\u2019s ongoing sovereign activities in \nsupport of microfinance and financial inclusion.  \n \n15.  While the TA will directly benefit ABTJ sustainability, the massive training effort will \nbenefit many individuals who are likely to be absorbed by other financial institutions after \ncompletion of the training. Therefore, the TA will have substantial positive spillover effects to \nother Tajik banks, and demonstrate the potential of lending to small businesses, thus reducing \nincome poverty in a fragile economic environment. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n16.  The TA impact will be to help ABTJ become a sustainable greenfield bank serving as a \nmodel for nascent economies. The outcome will be an improved rural ABTJ branch network. \nThe impact will be measured by the frequency of other financial institutions adopting responsible \nfinance  policies  and  ABTJ-specific  performance  metrics  of  profitability,  asset  quality,  and \nnational and rural client outreach by 2018 (Appendix 1). \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n17.  The TA has four outputs: rural branches established and profitable, adequate portfolio \nquality, loan officers trained, and financial literacy training provided to customers.  \n \n18.  The TA will build ABTJ capacity by providing classroom and on-the-job training in credit \nanalysis, risk management, and staff integrity. Financial literacy training of customers will be \nprovided  in  line  with  Consultative  Group  to  Assist  the  Poor  (CGAP)  responsible  finance \nprinciples.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,026,000, of which (i) $200,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Financial Sector Development Partnership Fund4 and administered by ADB; and \n(ii) $300,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF-V). The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. The remaining cost of the \nTA is to be funded by ABTJ in the context of its ongoing management service contract with LFS, \nwhich includes external expert support, seminars, and training.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  ABTJ is the beneficiary of the TA. Administration of the TA will be delegated to LFS, \nwhich holds 14.2% of AMH\u2019s shares. LFS executes a management contract for ABTJ as it does \nfor other banks of the Access Microfinance bank network. LFS is intimately familiar with the \nrequirements of ABTJ and is most capable of developing the terms of reference, and managing \nthe consulting services. Individual consulting assignments are most appropriate as these allow \nLFS to identify experienced experts and are more cost-effective than contracting a firm. The TA \nwill  require  63  person-months  of  inputs  from  long-term  experts  in  charge  of  (i)  regional \n                                                 \n4  Contributor: the Government of Luxembourg. \n ", "5 \n \noperations (outside the capital city); (ii) branch expansion, supervision, and training; and (iii) \nbranch  management  as  further  described  in  detail  in  the  Outline  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants in Appendix 3.  \n \n21.  AMH and LFS, its strategic investor, have successfully established and operate six \nMSME finance banks in challenging African and Central Asian markets and in this context have \nadopted adequate processes for procurement and management of consulting services, as well \nas internal and external audits in line with IFI policies and requirements and with their IFI \nshareholders. The competitive selection and management of individual experts will be delegated \nto LFS in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013) and Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010), each as amended from time to time, and as supervised by the \nPrivate Sector Operations Department in accordance with a TA agreement. The TA is to be \nimplemented from March 2014 to June 2016. The TA closing date will be 31 December 2016. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $200,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Financial Sector Development Partnership Fund, and (ii) ADB \nproviding  the  balance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $300,000  on  a  grant  basis,  to \nAccessBank Tajikistan Joint Stock Company, for Capacity Building for Rural Financial Inclusion \nin Tajikistan and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1   \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \nand Indicators with  Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact       Assumption \nABTJ will be a  At least three financial  AMFOT and ABTJ  Products of MSMEs \nsustainable greenfield  institutions subscribe to  reports  continue to be in \nbank serving as a model  responsible finance  demand \nfor nascent economies  policies in their   \noperations by 2018  Risks \n  Regulatory risks  \nABTJ\u2019s ROE >10% by   \n2018 (baseline:  Country risks \nnegative in 2012)   \n \nABTJ\u2019s PAR (30 days) \nremains \u2264 6% of gross \nloans by 2018 \n \nThe number of ABTJ \nborrowers exceeds \n20,000 by 2018 \n(baseline: 6,000 in \n2013) \n \nThe number of ABTJ \nrural borrowers exceeds \n3,000 by 2018 \n(baseline: 200 in 2013) \nOutcome        \nABTJ has an improved  At least three additional  Quarterly ABTJ \nrural branch network   rural branches have by  management reports \n  2017 (i) MIS in place;  and lending statistics \nwith audit, integrity, and \nresponsible finance \npolicies enforced by \nbranch managers;  \n(ii) PAR (30 days) \u2264 5% \nof gross loans; and  \n(iii) at least eight loan \nofficers per branch \n \nOutputs       Assumption \n1.
