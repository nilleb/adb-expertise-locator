The Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) requested the \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) assistance1 to prepare the proposed Na Bong\u2013Udon Thani \nPower Transmission Project for possible ADB financing. Preliminary fact-finding was undertaken \nduring 27\u201331 August 2007, and the project\u2019s concept clearance was obtained on 31 October \n2007. A subsequent mission fielded during 3\u20135 October 2007 reached an understanding with \nthe Government on the objectives, scope, cost estimates, financing plan, and implementation \narrangements  for  this  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA).  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Lao PDR is among the poorest countries in Asia with a gross domestic product per \ncapita of $490 in 2005. The country has significant hydropower potential, estimated at about \n18,000 megawatts (MW), but only 663 MW has been harnessed so far. Thirty-three potential \nhydropower sites have been evaluated for development, and 11 projects with a total capacity of \n4,000  MW  are  expected  to  be  developed  in  the  next  15  years.  Realizing  the  country\u2019s \nhydroelectric power potential is challenging due to domestic resource constraints on financing \nits  development.  Recognizing  the  need  to  attract  financing,  the  Government  is  strongly \npromoting private sector involvement; as such, most of the future projects were developed by \nindependent power producers under concession agreements with the Government. Due to a \nfairly low domestic power demand and a rapidly growing power demand in other parts of \nSoutheast Asia, most of the country\u2019s hydropower is destined for export, which provides an \nopportunity to generate much-needed foreign currency revenues to the Government. These \nrevenues will enable investments in rural electrification as well as in other social development \nand poverty reduction programs. Lao PDR\u2019s export of hydropower also benefits other Southeast \nAsian  countries  like  Thailand  and  Viet  Nam  by  providing  economically  efficient  and  \nclimate-friendly power sources as compared to more expensive thermal power generation.  \n \n3.  The Country Strategy and Program for Lao PDR has recognized the importance of \ndeveloping its hydropower for export to generate foreign currency income through royalties, \ntaxes, and dividends to the Government, which will in turn contribute to the country\u2019s broader \nsocial  and  economic  development.  In  addition,  the  Regional  Country  Strategy  Program  \n(2007\u20132009) for the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS)2 focuses on (i) strengthening physical \ninfrastructure for cross-border connectivity, and (ii) integrating national markets for promoting \neconomic  efficiency  and  private  sector  development.  The  GMS\u2019s  power  market  is  moving \ntoward  effective  regional  cooperation,  and  Lao  PDR  is  one  of  the  pioneering  countries  in \nbilateral power trade in accordance with the GMS\u2019s Inter-Governmental Agreement on Regional \nPower Trade. The governments of Lao PDR and Thailand signed a framework agreement to \ntrade power that provides power sale arrangements of up to 5,000 MW by 2015.  \n \n4.  The proposed project will consist of two components: (i) acquisition by Electricit\u00e9 du \nLaos (EdL) from the Nam Ngum 2 project developer of the 27 kilometer (km)-long 500 kilovolt \n(kV) transmission line from Na Bong substation to the Thailand border, and (ii) construction of \nthe 500/230 kV Na Bong substation. The transmission line and substation will be used as a \ncommon transmission facility to evacuate power from the Nam Ngum 2, Nam Ngum 3, Nam \nTheun 1, and Nam Ngiep 1 hydropower projects, which have a total capacity of over 1,800 MW. \nThe  facility  will  be  owned  by  EdL  and  will  be  operated  and  maintained  by  a  proposed  \n                                                 \n1  The technical assistance (TA) first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 27 September 2007. \n2  ADB 2006. Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program Update (2007-2009): Greater Mekong Subregion. Manila. \n ", "2   \nEGAT\u2013EdL  joint  venture.  Each  hydropower  project  will  construct  a  dedicated  power \ntransmission line to the Na Bong substation. The 500 kV transmission line is being financed and \nconstructed by the Nam Ngum 2 developer by 2010 at 230 kV to evacuate power from the Nam \nNgum 2 project to Thailand.  \n \n5.  By mid-2012, the Na Bong substation is required to evacuate power from the Nam Ngum \n3 and Nam Theun 1 hydropower projects. The transmission line from Na Bong to the Thailand \nborder will be connected to the substation, and its operating voltage will be upgraded to 500 kV. \nThe Nam Ngiep 1 hydropower project, scheduled to begin commercial operation in January \n2014, will also be connected to the substation. As the substation and transmission line will be \nused as a common transmission facility to serve four hydropower projects, the Nam Ngum 2 \nproject\u2019s concession agreement provided an option to the Government of buying back the \ntransmission line at cost. The Government intends to finance the substation\u2019s construction and \nthe transmission line\u2019s acquisition through the proposed project.  \n \n6.  The proposed project is expected to be financed using ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, \nand the corresponding loan\u2019s debt service must be fully covered by the additional foreign \ncurrency revenues to be earned through wheeling charges, i.e., use of transmission charges. \nThe loan will be structured as a multitranche financing facility (MFF) with two tranches. The first \ntranche will be used to finance the substation, with a contract award expected in mid-2009. The \nsecond tranche will be earmarked for the acquisition, i.e., refinancing, of the transmission line. It \nis envisaged that the refinancing will take place in 2012 when the substation is commissioned \nand the Nam Ngum 3 and Nam Theun 1 hydropower projects are ready to use the transmission \nline as a common transmission facility during their testing and commissioning period. The \ntransmission line\u2019s ongoing construction cost, buyout formula, and fairness of value will be \ndetermined during the PPTA\u2019s course. The transmission line\u2019s actual refinancing cost will be \ndetermined at the time the Government exercises its right to buy out the private investor and will \nbe at a price not more than fair value, including the depreciation cost deduction. The terms and \nconditions of the second tranche\u2019s loan will be negotiated with the Government separately upon \ncompletion of full appraisal. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact of the PPTA will be to promote the economic growth of the country and \nregion by helping Lao PDR to develop its hydroelectric power resource in an environmentally \nand socially sustainable manner. It will also promote power trade in the GMS.  \n \n8.  The outcome of the PPTA will be to formulate the proposed project\u2019s financing program, \nusing the MFF and preparing two loans that are structured and scheduled to suit the commercial \noperation schedule of the four hydropower developers. PPTA consultants will also prepare the \nlegal documents for the subsequent operation of the common transmission facility provided \nthrough the proposed project and assist the Government in negotiating agreements with EGAT \nbased on these documents. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The  PPTA  will  review  the  technical  design  of  the  Na  Bong  substation  and  the \ntransmission line to assess their ability to transmit power reliably from all four hydropower plants \nby considering each power plant\u2019s operating characteristics. PPTA consultants will undertake \ndue diligence on the (i) cost estimates of the transmission line being built by the Nam Ngum 2 \n ", "  3\ndeveloper, including equipment and materials, and determine the cost of the section from Na \nBong to the Thailand border; (ii) the implementation schedule for timely completion of the \ntransmission line and substation to evacuate power from the associated hydropower projects; \n(iii) operation and maintenance (O&M) arrangements of EdL and EGAT for the transmission line \nand substation; and (iv) technical specifications of the substation and its compatibility with the \nEGAT and EdL power transmission systems. The PPTA will also review the bidding documents \nprepared by EGAT for the procurement of the substation on turnkey basis and assist EdL in the \nprocurement  process,  including  bid  evaluation,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n10.  By undertaking an economic analysis in accordance with ADB guidelines, the economic \nbenefits to Lao PDR and Thailand due to power trading will be identified, and the economic \nrationale for the Government\u2019s investment in the common transmission facility will be justified. \nThe PPTA will undertake a financial analysis from EdL\u2019s point of view and will recommend the \noverall level of wheeling charges and a methodology for allocating them to the four hydropower \nprojects by taking into account the construction costs, O&M costs, financing costs including \ninterest during construction, and the timing of the projects\u2019 commercial operation. The detailed \ncost estimates for both components will be prepared in accordance with ADB guidelines on \nidentifying local and foreign costs, taxes, interest during construction, and price and physical \ncontingencies.  The  PPTA  will  analyze  the  financial  implications  to  EdL\u2019s  overall  financial \nperformance,  due  to  its  ownership  of  the  common  transmission  facility,  and  update  EdL\u2019s \nfinancial projections, which were prepared under earlier ADB technical assistance.3 \n \n11.  The PPTA will undertake due diligence of the contractual and legal aspects associated \nwith the transmission line\u2019s financing by the Nam Ngum 2 developer and the transfer of its \nownership to EdL, including the preparation of legal documents for the transfer. With respect to \nthe hydropower companies\u2019 power purchase agreement (PPA) obligations, the PPTA will also \nundertake due diligence of additional commercial risks for EdL due to its ownership of the \ntransmission line and propose suitable mechanisms to mitigate these risks. These mechanisms \nwill  include  recommendations  on  institutional  arrangements  for  the  common  transmission \nfacility\u2019s ownership, O&M agreements for the facility with EGAT, and contractual obligations on \nthe transmission line\u2019s reliability. The PPTA will prepare legal documents for the payment of \nwheeling charges by the hydropower developers to EdL, consistent with the PPA and the \ncontractual  agreements.  Contractual  and  legal  mechanisms  will  be  proposed  for  \nring-fencing  the  wheeling  charges  to  have  first  priority  for  debt  service,  including  the \nestablishment of an escrow account for debt service.  \n \n12.  In accordance with ADB policies and guidelines on environmental assessments, the \nPPTA will review the initial environmental examination (IEE) and summary IEE prepared by the \nNam Ngum 2 developer for the transmission line and will prepare the IEE for the Na Bong \nsubstation. The study shall cover both components\u2019 areas, taking into account the likely impacts \nassociated  with  their  locations,  designs,  and  construction  activities,  and  will  recommend \nimprovements to the IEE for the transmission line if any inconsistencies with relevant ADB \npolicies exist. Special attention will be paid to the proposed project\u2019s proximity and anticipated \nimpacts to culturally- and ecologically-protected areas as well as the transmission line\u2019s Mekong \nRiver crossing. The PPTA will also undertake environmental due diligence on the environmental \nsafeguard requirements and performance of the transmission line\u2019s Thailand portion to identify \ninconsistencies with national safeguard requirements, recommend solutions or action plans to \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2006.

In accordance with ADB\u2019s relevant policies and guidelines, the PPTA will prepare a \nsample-based social impact assessment of the proposed project and its associated facilities \n(i.e.,  the  four  transmission  lines  connecting  to  Na  Bong  substation)  to  provide  adequate \ninformation  including  any  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  and  potential  impacts  on  ethnic \nminority  groups.  If  there  are  any  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples,  the  PPTA  will  provide \nmitigation  measures/affirmative  activities  to  ensure  that  they  are  safeguarded  during  the \nconstruction and project implementation period. The PPTA will undertake due diligence of the \nresettlement plan and its implementation for the transmission line and prepare a resettlement \nplan, including any ethnic minority-specific actions for the substation if social impacts result that \nwill trigger ADB\u2019s social safeguard policies.4 The PPTA will also conduct due diligence on the \nThailand  portion  of  the  transmission  line  to  identify  inconsistencies  with  national  social \nsafeguard requirements, recommend solutions or action plans to address these irregularities, \nand summarize the results into the social impact assessment report. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The PPTA\u2019s total cost is estimated at $910,000 equivalent, comprising $760,000 in \nforeign currency and $150,000 equivalent in local currency. ADB will finance $760,000. The \nPPTA  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  through  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the \nGovernment  of  Japan.  The  Government  of  Lao  PDR  will  finance  the  remaining  $150,000 \nequivalent of local currency cost through in-kind contributions. These contributions include office \naccommodation and facilities, counterpart staff, data, and other information needed for the \nPPTA. Detailed cost estimates and a financing plan are shown in Appendix 3. The Government \nhas been informed that approval of the PPTA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing \nproject.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mines  (MEM)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  and  the \nDepartment  of  Energy  Promotion  and  Development  (DEPD),  the  Department  of  Electricity \n(DOE), and EdL will jointly be the implementing agencies. EGAT has agreed to work closely \nwith the consultants on the PPTA\u2019s technical aspects as EGAT is the technical advisor and \nprospective O&M contractor for the common transmission facility. \n \n16.  A steering committee chaired by the director general of DEPD and composed of the \ndeputy directors general from DOE and EdL will be established and will review the progress of \nthe PPTA on a monthly basis or more frequently if required. \n \n17.  The PPTA will require about 28 person-months of consulting services, including 18 \nperson-months  of  international  and  10  person-months  of  national  consulting  services.  The \nconsulting team will consist of power transmission, financial, economics, legal, environmental, \nand social development specialists. The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 4. The \nconsultants will submit the following reports to MEM and ADB: \n(i)  an inception report within 1 month after commencement of services; \n(ii)  an interim report 4 months after the commencement of services; \n(iii)  a draft final report 7 months after the commencement of services; and \n(iv)  a final report 8 months after the commencement of services. \n                                                 \n4  ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), and Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n ", "  5\n \n18.  A consulting firm will be engaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). A simplified technical proposal format and \nthe  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  (90:10  ratio)  will  be  used.  PPTA-financed \nequipment will be procured under ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time \nto time), and purchased equipment will be handed over to MEM at the end of the services. The \nPPTA will be completed in 8 months, from January 2008 to August 2008.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n1.  Hydropower is the most abundant natural resource in Lao PDR and represents the country\u2019s single largest \nforeign exchange source, accounting for 30% of total earnings. Therefore, the Government is emphasizing the \nfurther development of the export-oriented hydropower project and private sector investment to develop similar \nprojects.  The  Government  also  recognizes  that  a  factor  contributing  to  poverty  incidence  reduction  is \nimprovement in market access internally and with neighboring countries. The Country Strategy Program for Lao \nPDR recognized the importance of developing a hydropower resource as an export commodity to generate \nforeign currency for the Government through royalties, taxes, and dividends on government investment in \nhydropower projects. These projects will contribute to the country\u2019s broader social and economic development \nthrough an increased revenue base to the Government. The Regional Country Strategy Program (2007\u20132009) for \nthe GMS is based on four pillars, including (i) strengthening physical infrastructure for cross-border connectivity, \nand (ii) integrating national markets for promoting economic efficiency and private sector development. The \nproposed project, which will establish a 500 kV power transmission line between Lao PDR and Thailand and \nsupport private hydropower investors in Lao PDR, is in line with ADB\u2019s strategy.  \nB.  Targeting Classification \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n General Intervention    Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-\nM1, M2, etc.) \n2.  Explain the basis for the targeting classification: The proposed project is aimed at providing bulk power \ntransmission between Thailand and Lao PDR and contributing to Lao PDR\u2019s general economic growth through \nincreased revenues to the Government that can used for poverty reduction programs. \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  If the Project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed? Not \napplicable. \n2.  What resources are allocated in the PPTA/due diligence? The PPTA will undertake due diligence on those \ndirectly affected by the proposed project to ensure that ADB\u2019s safeguard policies are fully complied with.  \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-\npoor governance, and pro-poor growth)? There is no opportunity for pro-poor design as the proposed project \ndoes not have direct beneficiaries other than the Government of Lao PDR through royalties, taxes, and \ndividends.  \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the Project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit \nfrom the Project? The proposed project\u2019s primary beneficiaries are the Government of Lao PDR and the four \nprivate sector hydropower developers that will be using the transmission line to transmit power to Thailand. Lao \nPDR\u2019s general and poor population will indirectly benefit through poverty reduction programs to be financed \nthrough the Government\u2019s additional revenues from hydropower exports to Thailand. In addition, the Nam Ngiep \nI project is supplying 18 MW to the domestic grid, enabling the Government to extend its electrification to rural \nareas. \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? Not applicable.  \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project \naddress them? Not applicable. \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.

What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., \nworkshops, community mobilization, involvement of nongovernment organizations and community-based \norganizations, etc.)? Extensive consultation will be undertaken with the parties that have a commercial interest \nin the proposed project, including private sector investors. IEE findings will be made available to the interested \nparties. Consultation will be undertaken with people directly affected by the proposed project with respect to \nland acquisition and resettlement.  \n3.
