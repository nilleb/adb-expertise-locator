The clean development mechanism (CDM) was proposed under the Kyoto Protocol to \nreduce global emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and to assist developing countries in \nachieving sustainable development. During the Country Programming Mission of 2002, the \nGovernment of Indonesia requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to include in the \nCountry Strategy and Program (CSP) 2003\u20132005 technical assistance (TA) for institutional \ndevelopment to manage and promote CDM. ADB fielded the Fact-Finding Mission during 23-30 \nAugust 2004 to prepare the TA paper on Institutionalizing the Clean Development Mechanism.1 \nThe Mission held discussions with officials from the BAPPENAS (National Development and \nPlanning Agency), Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, and \nother relevant government agencies regarding the TA on CDM, and solicited the Government\u2019s \nviews on the TA objectives, scope, terms of reference, implementation arrangements and cost \nestimates. The Mission and the Government reached an understanding on the TA goals, scope, \nimplementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference.2  The TA \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Indonesia was one of the fastest growing economies in Southeast Asia before the \nfinancial crisis in 1997. It has stabilized and has had growth rates ranging from 3.4% to 4.9% \nsince 2000. Indonesia has significant deposits of coal, oil and gas and its future economic \ngrowth will increase the domestic demand for these energy sources and lead to an increase in \nGHG emissions. The Asia Least-Cost Greenhouse Gas Abatement Strategy (ALGAS) study3 \nestimated that energy sector emissions for Indonesia would increase from 125.30 million tons \ncarbon dioxide equivalent in 1990 to 541.13 million tons in 2010 and 913.13 million tons in \n2020. Developing member countries\u2019 (DMC) participation in the global effort to reduce GHG \nemissions is constrained due to their concerns that this would slow down their economic \ngrowth. The CDM is a cooperative instrument that will enable DMCs to participate in GHG \nemissions reduction (ER) and simultaneously attain sustainable development. \n \n3.  In June 1992 with the ratification of the United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change (UNFCCC), a likely change in climate was accepted as a global environmental \nchallenge. Stabilization of GHG emissions was the most important objective of the convention. \nAt the third conference of the parties to the UNFCCC (COP-3) in 1997, the Kyoto Protocol to \nUNFCCC was adopted where the developed countries agreed to reduce their overall emissions \nby 5.2% below 1990 levels in the first commitment period of 2008\u20132012. CDM, a market-based \nmechanism, introduced under the Kyoto Protocol, enables developed countries (or Annex I \nparties) to meet their ER commitments in a flexible and cost-effective manner and assists \ndeveloping countries in meeting their sustainable development objectives. While developed \ncountries benefit by obtaining GHG ER credits at a lower cost than in their own economies, the \ngains to the host countries are investments that lead to local sustainable development benefits.  \n \n4.  At the COP-7 to the UNFCCC held in Marrakesh, Morocco, in November 2001, the \nbasic rules for the CDM were agreed upon. Projects starting in 2000 are eligible to earn credits \nfor ER if they lead to \u201creal, measurable, and long-term\u201d GHG reductions, which are additional to \nany  that  would  occur  in  the  absence  of  the  CDM  project. A  CDM  executive  board  was \n                                                 \n1 The Mission comprised S. Gupta, project economist (energy), Southeast Asia Infrastructure Division.  \n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 6 September 2004. \n3  ADB,  Global  Environment  Facility,  and  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  1998.  Asia  Least  Cost \nGreenhouse Gas Abatement Strategy.  ", "2 \nestablished with 20 members, and was authorized to approve methodologies for CDM projects, \naccredit operational entities, and maintain the CDM registry.  \n \n5.  A CDM project produces a new commodity, ER credits, or avoided emissions. CDM \nproject processing requires development of the project design document (PDD), validation of \nthe  PDD  by  an  independent  entity4,  registration  of  the  project  with  the  executive  board, \nmonitoring and verification of ERs during project operation, and certification of the ERs by the \nexecutive board. Certified ERs can be traded to generate revenue for the project owner and \ncan be used by Annex I parties to meet their GHG reduction obligations.  \n \n6.  CDM  projects  generate  ER  credits  through  initiatives  that  include  promotion  of \nrenewable energy, methane gas capture, industrial efficiency improvements, fuel switching, \ndemand-side efficiency improvements, and forestry and agriculture sector initiatives. These \nprojects embody win-win results like GHG abatement while reducing domestic demand for fossil \nfuels and other environmental pollutants. Indonesia has a large potential to benefit from such \nwin-win options. However, as CDM is a new instrument, capacity development is required \namong the potential CDM developers and the government to process CDM projects. Lack of \nproper institutions can impede the efficient implementation of CDM projects.  \n \n7.  The Kyoto Protocol will become effective in February 2005.5 Many developed countries \nhave initiated national plans to meet their Kyoto targets. Indonesia signed the Kyoto Protocol in \nJuly  1998  and  established  a  National  Committee  on  Climate  Change.    The  Indonesian \nGovernment and Parliament approved law number 17/2004 to ratify the Kyoto Protocol on 23 \nJune 2004. CDM approval procedures are being formulated and urgent action is required to \nestablish the necessary institutions for implementing CDM projects. This process needs internal \nsupport from various government agencies. However, the capacity in different agencies to \nunderstand the CDM process hinders the expeditious implementation of CDM. \n \n8.  Indonesia has a strong commitment to the millennium development goals (MDGs) and \nBAPPENAS has the lead role in incorporating them in the Five-Year National Development \nPlan.  CDM  contributes  to  goal  7,  which  is  to  ensure  environmental  sustainability,  and \nspecifically to target 9, which is to integrate principles of sustainable development into country \npolicies and programs and reverse the loss of environmental resources. One of the indicators \nfor target 9 is per capita emission of carbon dioxide equivalent. CDM projects will help lower per \ncapita carbon emissions, taking Indonesia closer to achieving its MDGs. \n \n9.  ADB has earlier supported capacity building TAs on GHG mitigation. The ALGAS project \n(footnote  3)  was  developed  through  a  regional TA6  for  12  DMCs  (including  Indonesia)  to \ndevelop their first GHG inventory. Other ADB TAs for GHG reduction include the PREGA \n(Promotion  of  Renewable  Energy  and  Energy  Efficiency  for  Greenhouse  Gas Abatement) \nproject,  which  aims  to  promote  investments  in  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency \ntechnologies  that  will  help  reduce  GHG  emissions.7    A  TA  on  carbon  sequestration8  was \n                                                 \n4  These are designated operational entities (DOE) that validate and verify that real GHG reductions resulted. \n5  The Protocol\u2019s effectiveness was imminent on ratification by Russia. The lower house of the Russian Parliament \nratified the Kyoto Protocol on 22 October 2004. The Protocol will become effective on 19 February 2005. \n6  TA 5592-REG: A Study of Least-Cost Greenhouse Gas Abatement Strategy for Asia, for $8,237,000, approved on \n4 August 1994; and successive supplementary TAs for $492,000, approved on 10 September 1996; and for \n$133,363, approved on 19 June 1998. \n7 TA 5972-REG: Promotion of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency for Greenhouse Gas Abatement, for \n$5,000,000, approved on 4 January 2001. \n8  TA 4137-INO: Carbon Sequestration Through the Clean Development Mechanism, for $700,000, approved on 2 \nJuly 2003. ", "    3 \nprovided to Indonesia to promote sustainable forest development, with part support from CDM \nrevenues. ADB has also established the CDM Facility to facilitate agreements between buyers \nand sellers, and to assist its DMCs in developing CDM projects. \n \n10.  The 2003\u20132005 CSP and CSP Update 2004\u20132006 address the main medium-term \nneeds of the economy, stressing (i) improvements in governance, (ii) meeting local needs \nthrough  decentralization,  (iii)  human  development,  (iv)  environmental  management  and \nsustainable use of natural resources, and (v) raising long-term growth prospects and economic \npotential. This TA contributes to (iv) by developing capacity to implement CDM projects, like \nrenewable energy projects, energy efficiency improvements in industries, and improved waste \nmanagement practices. Such initiatives will increase the access of remote and rural populations \nto  efficient  and  modern  forms  of  energy  through  the  proliferation  of  renewable  energy \napplications,  conserve  fossil  fuels,  and  allow  environmentally  sustainable  practices  in \nagriculture and industry. The potential for GHG abatement projects is large and developing \nthem as CDM projects will help achieve both local and global objectives.  \n \n11.  The Government has established an inter-ministerial working group that participates in \nthe ongoing international deliberations. An Indonesian independent power producer is trading \ncarbon credits from its geothermal power plant. The Government is negotiating bilateral carbon \npurchase agreements. This TA will strengthen the Government\u2019s capacity to process CDM \nprojects and to negotiate with international parties more efficiently, increase the acceptability of \nCDM  projects  by  local  and  national  agencies,  enhance  local  capacity  in  preparing  CDM \nprojects, and lower transactions costs. For investors and buyers this will reduce uncertainty, \nimprove  reliability  and  ensure  efficient  production  and  procurement  of  ER  credits.  Waste \nmanagement has a large potential for generating carbon credits and would address a growing \nproblem in urban areas. In Indonesia, so far CDM strategies exist only for the energy sector, \nthereby necessitating a CDM policy for waste management.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n12.  The  goal  of  the  TA  is  to  achieve  lower  GHG  emissions  and  support  sustainable \ndevelopment.  The  purpose  of  the  TA  is  to  maximize  benefits  from  CDM  and  to  develop \ninstitutional capacity to process/promote CDM projects. The TA will (i) develop capacity for and \nincrease awareness about the CDM process and its potential as a source of financing among \nlocal government, commercial banking sectors, and financial and other relevant public and \ngovernment  institutions;  (ii)  develop  the  capacity  of  local  trainers  to  guide  consultants  in \ndeveloping CDM projects, specially for small-scale activities; (iii) assist potential local applicants \nto  become  designated  operational  entities  (DOEs);  (iv)  formulate  policy  and  strategy  for \ndeveloping CDM in the waste management sector; (v) facilitate collaboration on CDM between \nthe government and industries; (vi) develop good practice examples of CDM including project \ndesign,  validation,  registration,  financing  and  impact  assessment  for  at  least  three  CDM \nprojects; (vii) assist the Government in developing national CDM guidelines and internal CDM \nprocedures in Bahasa Indonesia; and (viii) disseminate the TA findings to stakeholders.  \n \n13.  The deliverables from the TA include (i) a review of the CDM process and its potential \nto  finance  projects  in  Indonesia;  (ii)  at  least  five  regional  training  workshops  for  local \ngovernment officials, and local commercial bank staff on issues and requirements of CDM \nproject activities; (iii) two CDM awareness building workshops for national public institutions, \nincluding the Ministry of Finance, BAPPENAS, and state auditors; (iv) guidelines elaborating ", "4 \nsimplified small-scale CDM modalities and procedures; (v) training workshops for building the \ncapacity of local trainers to train national consultants in developing small-scale CDM projects; \n(vi) sector policy and strategy outline to promote CDM activities in waste management projects; \n(vii) roundtable discussions between representatives of industry, designated national authority \n(DNA) and international experts on problems faced in developing CDM projects; (viii) support to \npotential local DOEs to register; (ix) at least three draft PDDs for CDM; (x) validation and \nregistration of the PDDs produced in (ix); and (xi) national guidelines and procedures on CDM \nprocessing  and  implementation  including  ER  purchase  agreements,  monitoring,  and \ncertification process. The focus will be on, but not restricted to, small-scale CDM projects. The \ntraining programs material, reference manuals, and guidelines will be developed in English and \nBahasa Indonesia.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n14.  The first task of the TA is to provide analytical information to various parties involved \nwith the development of CDM projects. The TA will conduct awareness and capacity building \nparticipatory  workshops  and  seminars,  provide  documentation  in  the  local  language,  and \nprovide support in incorporating CDM projects in an institution\u2019s activities. For example, the TA \nwill explain to local commercial banks how CDM can affect the project\u2019s rate of return, and the \nuncertainties associated with the CDM, to facilitate the processing of projects with a CDM \ncomponent. The TA will train trainers who, in turn, will guide national consultants on CDM \nproject activities. Guidelines elaborating simplified small-scale modalities, manuals and case \nstudies will be developed to assist national consultants and project developers. The executing \nagency (EA) and implementing agencies (IAs) with assistance from the TA consultants, will \nidentify local entities to be trained as trainers. Hands-on training will be given to the trainers by \ninvolving them in developing examples of CDM projects and in providing inputs to the regional \nworkshops. The TA will also guide local entities that may want to register as DOEs.  \n \n15.  The TA will develop a strategy for promoting CDM in the waste management sector.  \nThe strategy will include an assessment of the CDM potential in the sector, and policies and \nstrategies required to optimize global and local benefits. Approved CDM methodologies for \nlandfill gas will be considered in developing the country strategy for waste management. The \nGovernment  will  be  consulted  in  evaluating  different  policy  options  and  institutional \nrequirements. The consultants will also identify other sectors where similar strategies can be \ndeveloped. \n \n16.  The TA will develop at least three CDM projects as good practice examples based on \nreal data. The projects will highlight the role of local, provincial, and national institutions in the \nCDM process. Gaps identified in institutional capacity will be addressed under the TA. These \nprojects will be in addition to cases developed under the waste management strategy and will \nnot include carbon sequestration, which is included in the ongoing ADB TA 4137-INO (see \nfootnote 8). The TA will produce the CDM guidelines in Bahasa Indonesia for internal purposes, \nand a draft of procedures on government-to-government CDM processes, which is secure, in \nline with regulations, simple, and non-bureaucratic. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $938,000 equivalent, comprising $510,000 in \nforeign  exchange  and  $428,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  ADB  will  provide  $750,000 \nequivalent to finance the entire foreign exchange cost and $240,000 equivalent of the local \ncurrency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program.  The ", "    5 \nGovernment will finance the remaining $188,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  As EA, the Directorate of Environment and Natural Resources of BAPPENAS will have \noverall  responsibility  for  TA  management  and  implementation.  Two  IAs\u2014the  Ministry  of \nEnvironment,  and  DGEEU  of  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mineral  Resources  have  been \nidentified. Additional IAs, if required, can be identified during TA implementation. A steering \ncommittee will be set up to review and advise on TA implementation. The committee, to be \nchaired by BAPPENAS, will include representatives from the Ministry of Environment, Ministry \nof Agriculture, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Public Works, Ministry \nof  State-Owned  Enterprises,  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mineral  Resources,  Ministry  of  Home \nAffairs, CDM DNA, research institutes, universities, and representatives of local governments \nand commercial financial institutions. The IAs will assist the EA in identifying areas to focus on, \nbe stakeholders for different components, and participate in and provide inputs for the training \nprocess and the three potential CDM projects. All decision-making processes will be guided by \nthe steering committee, including approval of TA outputs before their submission to ADB. The \nEA and the IAs will cover their respective budgets. \n \n19.  The TA will be carried out in 15 months, from March 2005 to May 2006. A consulting \nfirm with expertise in CDM project development, policy analysis, economic analysis, capacity \nbuilding and waste management will be engaged to undertake the major TA components. The \nconsulting firm will provide an international expert in CDM and financial and economic analyses \nwho will be the team leader, an international legal expert, an international waste management \nexpert, and five domestic consultants. The domestic consultants will have expertise in CDM \nand financial sector, renewable energy, waste management, and social and institutional issues. \nTotal  consulting  services  to  be  provided  by  the  firm  will  include  12  person-months  of \ninternational expertise and 22 person-months of domestic expertise. The consultants\u2019 terms of \nreference are in Appendix 3. Domestic resource persons will also be engaged separately for \napproximately 4 person-months. All consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging \ndomestic consultants. Simplified technical proposals will be evaluated using the quality- and \ncost-based selection method for the consulting firm. The consultants will work closely with the \nEA  and  the  IAs.  Equipment  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement,  and  retained  by  the  EA  upon  TA  completion.  The  TA  findings  will  be \ndisseminated among concerned stakeholders through workshops and seminars. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Indonesia for Institutionalizing the Clean Development Mechanism Project, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board.

Introduction  \n1.  The clean development mechanism (CDM) as defined in the Kyoto Protocol and in the \nMarrakech Accords of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is \nan  instrument  that  delivers  local  and  global  benefits.  CDM  can  assist  Indonesia  to  reduce \ndependence  on  fossil  fuel  by  developing  and  using  indigenous  new  and  renewable  energy \nresources as mandated in its national energy policy. A strategy for improved waste management \nsystems not only reduces emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) but also provides effective ways \nto manage waste.
