The Government of the United Kingdom (UK), through its Foreign and Commonwealth \nOffice, approached the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the first half of 2007 to collaborate on \na study of the economics of climate change in Southeast Asia. The proposed regional technical \nassistance  (TA)  for  the  study  came  out  of  a  series  of  meetings  between  ADB  and  the \nGovernment of the UK in several global forums on climate change, and internal consultations \namong ADB\u2019s Economics and Research Department (ERD), Office of Cofinancing Operations \n(OCO),  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department  (RSDD)  and  Southeast  Asia \nRegional  Department  (SERD).  The  major  agreements  reached  on  the  objectives,  scope, \nimplementation arrangements, and financing plan of the TA1 are reflected in this paper. The TA \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recently released its fourth \nassessment report, Climate Change 20072, which underscores that the evidence of global \nwarming is now considered unequivocal based on observed increases in worldwide average air \nand ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow, and rising average sea level. Eleven of \nthe past 12 years rank among the 12 warmest years since global surface temperature was \nrecorded. 3  Climate models predict that the global average temperature could rise between \n1.8\u00b0C and more than 4.0\u00b0C by the end of the 21st century. A growing body of scientific evidence \nindicates  that  increases  in  greenhouse  gases  (GHG)  caused  by  human  activities  are \npredominantly responsible for the rapid climate change. The major source of GHG emissions is \nthe use of fossil fuels for energy. Other important sources include cement manufacturing, land \nuse and land use change, feedstocks in agriculture, and deforestation. \n3.  Climate change will have serious adverse impacts on the global environment and human \nsociety. It is expected to undermine agricultural productivity, decrease water quantity and quality \nin most arid and semiarid regions, increase the incidence of vector-borne diseases in the tropics \nand subtropics, and harm ecological systems and their diversity. In addition, the sea level rise \nassociated with anticipated increases in temperature could displace tens of millions of people \nliving in low-lying areas, and threaten the existence of small island states. A recent review of the \neconomics of climate change by the Government of the UK states that, if no action is taken now, \nthe overall cost and risks of climate change could be equivalent to the loss of 5% of global gross \ndomestic product (GDP) each year. If a wider range of risks and impacts is considered, the \nestimated damage could reach as high as 20% of global GDP.4 \n4.  Developing countries are more vulnerable than wealthier countries to climate change. \nPoor people face the most risk from the increased impacts of volatile weather patterns, such as \nfloods and droughts. In the Asia and Pacific region, where the majority of the world\u2019s poor \nresides, the IPCC has suggested that glacier melting, as a result of global warming, could affect \n500 million people in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan region, and an additional 250 million people in \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). This would have serious consequences for downstream \n                                                 \n1   The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 20 November 2007. \n2  IPCC. 2007.

Freshwater \navailability in Central, South, East, and Southeast Asia, particularly in large river basins, is \nprojected to decrease. Combined with population growth and increasing urbanization, this could \nadversely affect more than 1 billion people by the 2050s. Coastal and low-lying areas, especially \nheavily populated, mega-delta regions in South, East, and Southeast Asia, will be at greatest \nrisk due to increased flooding from the sea and rivers. Bangladesh, India, PRC and Viet Nam \nare cited as especially susceptible to increasing salinity of ground and surface water.5 \n \n5.  Therefore, climate change is both a development and environmental problem. In recent \nyears,  a  global  consensus  has  emerged  that  climate  change  must  be  addressed  soon. \nDeveloped and developing countries increasingly are being urged to reduce GHG emissions. \nEnergy  infrastructure  investments  in  low-carbon  technologies,  shifts  to  renewable  energy \nsources,  and  policies  to  promote  energy  efficiency  improvement  programs  are  considered \neffective means to reduce GHG emissions. Fuel efficiency and modal shifts in the transport \nsector,  biomass  feedstocks  for  energy  use  in  the  agricultural  sector,  and  forest-related \nmitigation  activities  such  as  carbon  dioxide  removals  by  sinks  also  could  mitigate  GHG \nemissions. 6  Many  of  the  climate  adaptation  actions,  including  more  effective  disaster \nmanagement  and  land  use  planning,  will  be  extensions  of  good  sustainable  development \npractices.  \n \n6.  Combating climate change will be a critical development challenge for Asia and the \nPacific in the decades to come. Asia\u2019s share of global GHG emissions is estimated to have \nincreased  from  less  than  9%  in  1973  to  24%  in  2003.  With  the  region\u2019s  rapidly  growing \neconomies and large population continuing to consume energy faster than the rest of the world, \nthe region\u2019s share of GHG emissions is projected to increase to 29% by 2030.7 However, many \nAsian developing countries are just beginning to address climate change, and their capabilities \nin this area are uneven. The public awareness of the urgency of combating climate change is \nstill low; potential socioeconomic impacts of climate change are not well understood; and more \ndiscussions are needed on the economic costs and benefits of unilateral and regional actions on \nmitigation and adaptation, as well as on supporting government and private sector actions to \nimplement policies to mitigate and adapt to climate change. \n \n7.  Supporting  environmentally  sustainable  growth  in  DMCs  is  one  of  ADB\u2019s  strategic \npriorities under its second medium-term strategy (2006\u20132008). ADB is in a good position to \nundertake this TA, because it is promoting similar climate change initiatives under its clean \nenergy and environment program. The study will be a major knowledge product, which ADB can \noffer to its DMCs. ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy (2004) draft action plan \nrecommends the development of synergies between disaster risk reduction and support for \nadaptation to climate change. The proposed TA will explore possibilities of cultivating synergies \nwith  ADB\u2019s  clean  energy  and  environment  program,  and  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency \nAssistance  Policy.  ADB  has  good  working  relationships  and  strong  links  with  institutions \ninvolved in climate change issues, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change, United Nations Environment Programme and its subregional partners, and \ninitiatives financed by the Global Environment Facility.  \n                                                 \n5  IPCC. 2007.

The purpose of the proposed TA is to (i) contribute to regional debate on economic costs \nand benefits of unilateral and regional actions on mitigation and adaptation; (ii) raise awareness \nabout the urgency of climate change challenges and their potential socioeconomic impact on \nthe participating countries, while informing other stakeholders (e.g., civil society, academia, \nmedia, nongovernment organizations, private sector, and aid agencies) of the same; and (iii) \nindirectly support government and private sector actions in the region to mitigate and adapt to \nclimate  change.  The  TA  will  cover  six  developing  member  countries  (DMCs):  Indonesia, \nMalaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam, as requested by the Government of \nthe UK.8  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA\u2019s impact is to contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions in the long term. The \nTA\u2019s outcomes are to (i) obtain the consensus and cooperation among policy makers in the \nregion on the steps needed to address climate change in Southeast Asia, including the adoption \nof investment programs, plans, policies, and/or other actions to adapt development to expected \nfuture climatic conditions; (ii) improve understanding of the economics of climate change to \nenable policy makers in the region to adopt necessary actions; and (iii) align ADB operations \nwith the needs of participating countries for addressing climate change problems. \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The proposed TA has three phases with corresponding activities and outputs, as follows: \n  \n(i)  Phase  I:  Scoping.  This  phase  will  involve  mapping  the  existing  or  expected \nregional or country-level analysis on climate change in terms of local impacts of \nclimate change, and options and costs for reducing GHG emissions locally. It will \ncover work carried out by governments, international organizations, academics, \nand  nongovernment  organizations.  The  scoping  will  help  identify  research, \nresearch gaps, and needs for further research. The methodology developed by the \nStern Review team will be introduced. \n \n(ii)  Phase  II:  Studying  country-specific  impacts  of  climate  change.  This  will \ninvolve  studies  and  national  consultations  leading  to  individual  country \nassessments of the impacts of climate change for the six participating countries. \nCountry-level  studies  will  be  undertaken  on  local  impacts  of  climate  change, \nadaptation, costs for reducing GHG emissions, and policy options. The findings of \nthis phase will be presented at the International Stern Symposium to be organized \nby the Government of the UK, tentatively scheduled in the second quarter of 2008.   \n \n(iii)  Phase  III:  Studying  regional  interdependencies  and  responses.  This  will \ninvolve conducting regional consultations to broaden the national assessments and \nto determine the level of regional interdependence through analysis of the costs \nand benefits of climate change mitigation in the short, medium, and long run. It also \nwill entail developing policy recommendations for the participating countries and \n                                                 \n8  The selection of countries was based on recommendations from the Government of the UK, which has discussed \nsimilar initiatives with the PRC and India. \n ", "4   \nrelevant regional bodies. Upon completion of the TA, the findings will be presented \nand disseminated at the side events of key multilateral gatherings, such as the \nConference of Parties 14 in December 2008.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA, which is estimated to cost $904,200, will be financed on a grant basis by the \nGovernment of the UK and administered by ADB. The proceeds will cover consulting services, \ncountry visits, events and workshops, publication, administration, and other administrative costs. \nThe cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for this TA. Within ADB, the TA is expected to be \nimplemented by the Economic Analysis and Operations Support Division (EREA) of ERD, in \nclose coordination with the Environment and Social Safeguard Division (RSES) of RSDD. The \nmanagement  of  the  TA  will  follow  a  three-tiered  structure.  A  study  team,  comprising  of \nrepresentatives from the participating countries and international consultants, will be formed to \ncarry out the TA activities. The team will be led by the team leader, appointed from among the \nADB staff, and will be guided by a steering committee. The committee, which will act as the \nproject executive, will set the methodological and strategic directions of the TA. Chaired by a \nreview leader, the committee will comprise representatives from ADB, the Government of the \nUK, and other partner institutions such as United Nations Economic and Social Commission for \nAsia and the Pacific. An advisory panel, comprising senior government officials from all the \nparticipating countries and regional bodies, will be formed to advise the work of the steering \ncommittee and the study team. The review leader will chair the advisory panel and will act as \nthe  conduit  between  the  advisory  panel  and  the  other  tiers.  The  review  leader  will  be  a \nprominent expert on climate change issues in the region. \n \n13.  The TA will require 20 person-months of individual international and 32 person-months of \nindividual national consulting services. In addition, the TA will engage administrative supporters \non  an  as-needed  basis.  All  the  consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (February 2007, as amended from time to time). The \nconsultants\u2019 terms of reference are in Appendix 3. Activities funded by this TA will start in a \nDMC only after ADB has received a \u201cno-objection\u201d in writing from its government. \n \n14.  The TA is expected to be implemented over 12 months from January to December 2008. \nThe outline of the final report is in Appendix 4. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering the technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $904,200 to be financed \non a grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom for a Regional Review of the \nEconomics of Climate Change in Southeast Asia, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", "  Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \n       \nContribute to the reduction of    \u2022  National, regional, and  \u2022  Climate change will \nGHG emissions in the long- global statistics  continue and impact \nrun    environment and human \n\u2022  International, regional,  society. \nand national forums on   \nclimate change  Risk \n   \n\u2022  Adverse effects of climate \nchange will intensify.  \n \nOutcome      Assumption \n       \n1.
