In response to requests from ASEAN+31 finance ministers, the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) supported the development of early warning systems (EWS) against the recurrence of \nfinancial  crises  in  selected  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)+3  countries \nthrough regional technical assistance (TA) 5986, An ASEAN+3 Framework for the Development \nof Early Warning Systems,2 and TA 6070, Capacity Building for Implementing Early Warning \nSystems.3 Under TA 5986, ADB facilitated the development of a prototype EWS together with a \ncore set of macroprudential indicators. The prototype was discussed during workshops jointly \norganized by ADB, the ASEAN Secretariat, and ASEAN+3 members in 2002. Under TA 6070, \nADB supported the implementation of the prototype by developing software (the Vulnerability \nIndicators  and  Early  Warning  System  for  Economic  and  Financial  Monitoring  [VIEWS]),  a \nsupporting regional database on macroprudential indicators, and a secured website for VIEWS \nusers. VIEWS was disseminated through regional workshops and installed in the central banks \nand in the finance ministries' national surveillance units (NSUs) of tne ASEAN+3 countries, \nwhere users were trained in its use.  \n \n2.  VIEWS software is now routinely used by ASEAN+3 central banks and finance ministries \nto monitor economic and financial conditions. With assistance from ADB, users have begun to \nmodify  the  EWS  prototype  to  suit  country-specific  conditions.  As  regional  authorities  gain \nfamiliarity  with  EWS  and  as  regional  cooperative  efforts  progress,  regional  dialogue  on \neconomic  surveillance  is  gaining  in  sophistication  and  there  is  a  desire  for  further  EWS \ndevelopment.  During  the  course  of  regional  EWS  training  workshops,  ASEAN+3  members \nrequested further support from ADB for EWS training and assistance in developing a new \nversion of VIEWS. ADB was asked to support the activities of the newly formed ASEAN+3 \nTechnical Working Group on Economic and Financial Monitoring (ETWG), which was launched \nduring the May 2006 ASEAN+3 Finance Ministers' Meeting (FMM) in Hyderabad, India. The TA \nconcept was developed and approved by ADB Management in October 2006.4 The support for \nthe proposed regional TA was discussed and agreed upon with ETWG members during the \ngroup's inaugural meeting in Hangzhou, People\u2019s Republic of China, in December 2006. The \nkey outcomes, activities, financing plan, and implementation arrangements are reflected in this \npaper. The TA framework is attached as Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Although  the  ASEAN+3  countries  are  making  significant  progress  in  reducing  the \nvulnerabilities that made the region's economies susceptible to financial and economic crises in \n1997\u20131998, new challenges to regional economic and financial stability continue to emerge. \nOngoing  global  financial  integration  and  innovation  present  new  complexities  to  regional \npolicymakers. Large potential benefits for developing member countries (DMCs) accompany the \nevolution of the global financial system, but so too do large risks such as the possible sudden \ncorrection  of  the  global  external  payments  imbalance,  to  which  ASEAN+3  economies  are \nparticularly vulnerable. At the same time, volatile short-term capital flows are reemerging to \n                                                 \n1  The ASEAN+3 countries include the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) plus the \nPeople's Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea.  \n2  ADB. 2001.

EWSs need to adapt to this new environment to \nensure that policymakers remain alert to potential new sources of instability.  \n \n4.  Alongside  globalization,  regional  integration  and  interdependence  are  growing,  and \nregional policy cooperation is deepening among the ASEAN+3 economies. ASEAN+3 FMM \nagendas continue to focus on initiatives to strengthen both the Economic Review and Policy \nDialogue (ERPD) process, which is the principal mechanism of regional economic and financial \nsurveillance; and the Chiang Mai Initiative (CMI), which is a short-term foreign currency liquidity \nfacility built through a network of bilateral swap arrangements. The success of these initiatives \nhinges on strong surveillance inputs from national governments. Strong economic surveillance \nsystems can also provide important support for assessing vulnerabilities in conjunction with \nmanaging public debt, developing national local financial markets, and other country-specific \neconomic and financial issues. However, finance ministers recognize the capacity limitations of \nnational  governments,  especially  in  the  smaller  ASEAN  economies,  to  keep  up  with  fast-\nchanging markets and provide effective monitoring and inputs into regional dialogue. Hence, in \n2006,  they  created  the  Group  of  Experts  (GOE)  and  ETWG  to  explore  ways  for  further \nstrengthening surveillance capacity in East Asia.  \n \n5.  A central focus of GOE and ETWG efforts in strengthening regional surveillance is to \ndevelop  a  more  comprehensive  framework  for  a  regional  approach  in  assessing  financial \nvulnerability. A critical component of that framework is an effective EWS that adapts to the \nrapidly developing regional economic and financial systems and exploits advances in EWS \nresearch so as to ensure detection of new threats to those systems. An effective EWS will \nprovide a quantitative basis for qualitative assessment and policy discussion of economic and \nfinancial threats at national, regional, and global levels. At the national level, surveillance units \nor similar offices at central banks and ministries of finance prepare internal reports that use \ninputs from VIEWS (and, sometimes, alternative systems) and include qualitative analyses on \nissues, risks, and policy issues. At the regional level, VIEWS provides inputs into ASEAN \nSecretariat reports to ASEAN+3 FMM and can be used in various other reports and analyses. \nIndirectly, these inputs inform regional officials' discussions at global forums.     \n \n6.  The key strength of the existing VIEWS, including its common core set of indicators, is \nits role both as a basis for common understanding and dialogue and as a prototype that \nparticipating ASEAN+3 members can be trained to use and that can be subsequently adapted \nto country-specific conditions. The key weaknesses of the existing system are (i) its need to be \nenhanced to reflect both evolving regional conditions and advances in modeling techniques; and \n(ii) the need to improve the capacity of government officials at central banks and finance \nministries to assess the quantitative results against qualitative assessments drawn from their \nown understanding of economic conditions, and draw appropriate policy conclusions. \n \n7.  Because of DMC capacity constraints, ADB support is necessary at this critical stage to \nsustain and build on earlier success in forging a common regional framework for assessing \nfinancial vulnerability, of which EWS is an integral part. This support is a key component of \nimplementation of the third pillar\u2014monetary and financial cooperation and integration\u2014of ADB's \nRegional Cooperation and Integration Strategy, which calls for ADB to support effective regional \neconomic surveillance, and development and establishment of EWS in DMCs.    \n \n8.  The success of ADB support for strengthening regional surveillance thus far rests on (i) \nclear ownership by ASEAN+3 officials of the process of building effective EWS in support of \nfinancial stability; (ii) a multifaceted approach to technical support and training that involves the \nprovision of inputs from external experts, on-site training, regional workshops, and software help \n ", "    3   \ndesk and website support; (iii) synergies with other ADB economic and financial monitoring \ntraining programs for ASEAN+3 officials;5 and (iv) intensive involvement of ADB staff with in-\nhouse  expertise  in  these  activities.  These  elements  should  continue  to  characterize  ADB \nassistance to ASEAN+3 EWS work.     \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The objective of the TA is to strengthen regional monitoring of economic and financial \nsystems. Identification of systemic financial and economic risks will increase the probability of \nearly detection of possible crises and permit timely policy action to prevent or mitigate a crisis. \nRegional monitoring will be strengthened by more informed and higher-quality discussions at \nETWG,  FMM,  and  other  regional  forums.  The  development  of  a  systematic  approach  for \nassessing  regional  financial  vulnerability  will  establish  a  common  framework  for  regional \nsurveillance  and  discussion  of  potential  vulnerabilities.  Moreover,  the  collective  process  of \ndeveloping such a systematic approach will itself strengthen the cooperative experience.  \n  \n10.  An important element of the approach will be an enhanced and organic VIEWS package \nthat adapts to new conditions while still serving as a prototype for NSUs. This prototype VIEWS  \ncan provide a quantitative basis for discussions of regional vulnerabilities. Through support for \nstrong, evolving quantitative inputs into national and regional surveillance systems, as well as \nqualitative discussions at ETWG meetings, the TA will provide significant value to regional \nefforts to monitor vulnerability of economic and financial systems. This will complement other \nADB assistance (noted above) that targets improvements in qualitative inputs through training \nprograms in economic and financial monitoring for officials at finance ministries and central \nbanks.  Starting  with  a  comprehensive  review  of  the  VIEWS  package,  including  the  set  of \nmacroprudential indicators and the methodological approach, an enhanced VIEWS package will \nevolve as an outcome of the ongoing and collaborative ADB and ETWG efforts.    \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The outcome outlined in paras. 9\u201310 will be achieved through three key ADB\u2013supported \noutputs to selected ASEAN+3 countries.6 \n \n12.  First, ADB will provide logistical, technical, and research support for developing  a \nsystemic regional approach to financial vulnerability assessment, including advanced versions \nof VIEWS, under the auspices of the newly formed ASEAN+3 ETWG. Specifically, in support of  \nthe semiannual ETWG meetings, beginning in the second half of 2007, ADB will support four \nworkshops. The agenda of the workshops, which will likely include inputs from both external and \ninternal (ADB) EWS experts, will be mutually agreed upon with ETWG. The topic, structure, and \n                                                 \n5  Related ADB assistance includes technical support for NSUs and training of Ministry of Finance and Central Bank \nofficials  under ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance for Technical Training and Capacity Building for Selected \nASEAN+3 Countries on Regional Economic and Financial Monitoring. Manila (TA 6342-REG, for $900,000, \napproved on 12 September); and ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance for Strengthening Economic and Financial \nMonitoring in Selected ASEAN+3 Countries. Manila (TA 6280-REG, for $600,000, approved on 2 December). \nThese TAs provide technical support and general training in surveillance to relevant officials (including in the use of \nVIEWS software and interpretation of VIEWS technical reports) but do not provide specific technical support to \nVIEWS  users  or  direct  support  to  the  ETWG  for  systematic  improvements  in  the  surveillance  framework \nunderpinning regional cooperation.  \n6 Cambodia, People's Republic of China, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, \nThailand, and Viet Nam. \n ", "4 \ninputs for the first workshop were expected to be agreed upon at the February 2007 ETWG \nmeeting. A comprehensive review of the current VIEWS package, an exploration of various \nsoftware  enhancements  requested  by  governments  (such  as  adaptation  to  use  with  debt \nmanagement systems), as well as its use by NSUs will likely be included in the first workshop \nagenda. In a possible progression, the second workshop could focus on options for enhancing \nthe VIEWs package; the third could set out a proposed enhanced prototype VIEWS package for \ncomment, refinement, and adoption by ETWG; and the fourth could give a demonstration of the \nfinished prototype.    \n \n13.  Second, ADB will facilitate cooperation among and between national and international \nagencies to enhance both the availability of consistent data sources and the development of \nmacroprudential indicators as well as their effective use in a comprehensive regional effort to \nmonitor economic and financial systems and assess potential vulnerabilities. The mechanism \nfor this effort would be a workshop. Targeting wider participation, the workshop will be held \nseparately from ETWG meetings and would ideally include participants from ASEAN+3 finance \nministries,  central  banks,  and  statistical  offices.  Other  international  agencies  such  as \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and Bank for International Settlements (BIS) may also be \ninvited.  \n \n14.  Third, ADB will undertake ongoing maintenance and upgrading of the VIEWS software \n(including revision of the users\u2019 manual) and secured VIEWS website, training of officials in \nNSUs and in relevant user departments of central banks, and technical support for adaptation of \nVIEWS to specific country conditions.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The total cost of the TA is $700,000, of which $600,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The governments of the \nparticipating countries will provide counterpart contributions in the form of salaries of counterpart \nstaff, office accommodation, equipment, and other overhead expenses in kind. Details of the \ncost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.   Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB will be the TA Executing Agency and its Office of Regional Economic Integration \n(OREI) will execute the TA in close collaboration with ETWG. OREI and ETWG will jointly plan \nand organize the four ETWG workshops. OREI, in consultation with ETWG, will organize the \nworkshop on macroprudential indicators. OREI will manage the activities related to maintaining \nthe secured VIEWS website and supporting VIEWS users. To provide inputs for the workshop, \ninternational consultants will be engaged. To support TA activities, especially ongoing VIEWS \nsupport, national consultants will be engaged. A no-objection letter will be obtained prior to \ncommencing or financing TA activities in the territory of the participating DMCs. \n \n17.  The TA will require approximately 11 person-months of international and 24 person-\nmonths of national consulting services. The TA will be implemented over 24 months, starting in \nApril  2007  and  ending  in  March  2009.  All  consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2006, as amended from time to \ntime). The scope of work and outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3.  \n \n18.  Research inputs prepared for the workshops will subsequently be peer-reviewed and \npublished as ADB working papers. The enhanced VIEWS software, revised VIEWS manual, \n ", "    5   \nand revised indicators will be available to users on the secured VIEWS website. The outcome of \nthe  assistance  will  be  evaluated  based  on  feedback  from  workshop  participants  and  from \nVIEWS users.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis for \nEnhancing the Capacity of Selected ASEAN+3 Countries for Assessing Financial Vulnerabilities, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n  \n \n ", "6      Appendix 1    \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nData  \nDesign  Performance   Assumptions \nSources/Reporting \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  and Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact       Assumptions  \nEnhanced regional  Greater quality of  ADB monitoring of  \u2022  ASEAN+3 members \nmonitoring of  reporting to and  discussions in and review  continue to be committed  \neconomic and  discussions in ASEAN  of reports submitted to  to monetary and financial \nfinancial systems  Surveillance Process  ASEAN Finance  cooperation. \n  and ASEAN+3  Ministers\u2019 Meeting and  \u2022  Participating DMC staff \nIncreased capacity  Economic Review   ASEAN+3 Deputy Central  have relevant background. \nto provide early  and Policy Dialogue  Bank and Finance \nwarnings and    Ministers\u2019 Meeting by \nmitigation of    ETWG and member \nfinancial crises    countries, feedback from \nASEAN+3 officials \nOutcome       Assumptions \nDevelopment of a  Regular use of current  Regular survey of and  \u2022   ETWG participating \nsystematic  and advanced version  feedback from EWS  countries are committed to \napproach to  of VIEWS and regular  workshop participants  establish, maintain, and \nregional financial  financial vulnerability  develop VIEWS. \nvulnerability  reports in DMCs  \u2022  Cooperation of government \n  units concerned allows \n  provision of relevant data. \n    \u2022  Recruitment of consultants \n  with required expertise is \n  timely. \n  \u2022  Supervision by ADB staff is \nadequate. \nOutputs      Assumptions \nRelevant quality  Presentation and  Feedback from workshop  \u2022  Engagement of qualified \nand peer-reviewed  discussion of research  participants and  consultants is timely. \nassessment of  at workshops  subsequent publication of  \u2022  Supervision by ADB staff is \nfinancial    research  adequate. \nvulnerability   VIEWS software and    \u2022  Workshops are regularly \n  manual upgraded  Manual published and  held.  \nAdvanced version    feedback on upgraded \nof VIEWS  Presentation and  version from users \n  discussion of indicator   \nImproved indicator  set at workshops  Indicators available in \nset for vulnerability  database \nassessment \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 1   7   \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs \n1.1 Hold  ETWG  workshop  twice  a  year  in  which  \u2022  ADB staff \nresearch is discussed.  \u2022  ETWG members \n1.2 Hold/publish research results.  \u2022  11 person-months international and 24 person-\n  months national consulting services ($225,000) \n2.1 Review and update indicator database.  \u2022  Travel and other consultants\u2019 expenses \n2.2 Discuss data and indicators among agencies  ($35,000) \n      concerned. \n\u2022  Equipment ($10,000) \n \n\u2022  Training, seminars, and conferences ($250,000) \n3.1 Develop advanced version of VIEWS. \n\u2022  Miscellaneous and contingency costs ($80,000) \n3.2 Post manual on the website. \n\u2022  Government financing ($100,000) \n3.3 Train officials of NSUs and other relevant     \n\u2022  Total cost: $700,000 \n      departments of central banks. \n \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ASEAN = Association of Southeast Asian Nations, DMC = developing member country,  \nETWG = Technical Working Group on Economic and Financial Monitoring, NSU = national surveillance unit, VIEWS = \nVulnerability Indicators and Early Warning System for Economic and Financial Monitoring. \n ", "8      Appendix 2    \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($'000) \n \nItem  Total Cost \nA.
