The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been assisting the Government of Viet Nam \n(the Government) in expanding education as a foundation for long-term social and economic \ndevelopment.  The  central  pillar  of  the  education  policy  in  Viet  Nam  is  to  develop  human \nresources to help meet the demands in the growing market and to ensure equity and quality. \nADB has particularly recognized the importance of secondary education in three dimensions: (i) \nin supporting the Government\u2019s commitment to universal lower secondary education; (ii) in \npursuing the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in terms of gender parity in primary and \nsecondary education; and (iii) in a strong linkage to the Socio-Economic Development Plan \n(SEDP) 2006\u20132010. The disparities in access to secondary education by gender, ethnic nature, \nand  region  have  been  addressed  as  one  of  the  most  critical  challenges  for  achieving \ngovernment commitment and MDGs. SEDP also emphasizes the urgency of innovating and \nimproving the quality of human resources for the country\u2019s industrialization. Sustained efforts in \nthe  past  decade  have  resulted  in  significant  advances  in  enrollments.  Nevertheless, \nuniversalizing secondary education with quality, equity, effectiveness, and sustainability is still a \nmajor  challenge.  Strategic  and  effective  frameworks  for  sector  performance  review,  policy \nplanning, and aid harmonization are crucial to achieve the above goals. \n \n2.  During the Country Programming Mission in 2003, the Government requested ADB \nsupport for an advisory technical assistance (TA) to prepare the updated secondary education \nsector master plan (SESMP) covering 2006\u20132010 that will serve as the baseline policy and \ninvestment program for all aid agencies active in secondary education, through a common \nprogram-based approach (PBA). The Fact-Finding Mission visited Viet Nam from 21 February to \n1 March 2005 and reached an understanding with the Government on the TA\u2019s goals, purpose, \nscope, implementation arrangements, cost estimates, financing arrangements, and terms of \nreference for consulting services. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.1    \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  In Viet Nam, education is regarded as a paramount investment option in the nation\u2019s \neconomic development and equitable society even under severe budget constraints. This was \nevidenced  by  the  recent  Government  decree  09/2005/Q5-TTg  for  improving  the  quality  of \nteaching staff and strengthening management for education up to 2010. The net primary school \nenrollment rate already reached 95% in 2004, and achieving universal primary education (one \nMDG) was assessed as \u201cfeasible\u201d in the annual MDGs progress review in 2005. Current major \nconcerns about primary education are, therefore, improving quality rather than simply promoting \naccess to schooling. With notable achievements in primary education, the education sector\u2019s \ntarget has gradually shifted to secondary education. \n \n4.  The Government\u2019s policy targets for secondary education are (i) raise the secondary \neducation net enrollment rate to 80% by 2005 and 90% by 2010; and (ii) phased expansion of \nupper secondary education. As the leading aid agency in the subsector, ADB has provided four \nloan  projects  and  six  TAs  since  the  MDGs  were  set  out.  The  assistance  covers  major \neducational inputs including training pre-service and in-service teachers, redesigning curricula, \nproviding textbooks and teaching materials, organizing capacity development training for the \nMinistry of Education and Training (MOET), constructing and rehabilitating schools, and piloting \nan assessment system.2 One assistance was to help MOET develop the SESMP 2001\u20132010. \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 25 January 2005. \n2  Assistance has been provided through the following past and ongoing loans and TAs: ADB. 1997. Report and \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Socialist Republic of Viet \nNam for the Lower Secondary Education Development Project. Manila; ADB. 1999. Report and Recommendation \n ", "2   \nThe SESMP stresses policy options for expanding and modernizing lower secondary education. \nThrough the joint efforts of the Government and ADB, the gross secondary education enrollment \nrate significantly increased from 32% in 1992 to 72% in 2004.  \n \n5.  Equitable, effective, and sustainable delivery  of secondary education, however,  has \nremained a critical issue. Gender and income disparity in access to schooling is still clearly \nobserved in the secondary education level even while the national average enrollment rates \nimproved. The disparity is also linked to a lack of role models in female teachers in ethnic \nminority  and  poor  community  schools.  Internal  and  external  efficiencies  of  schooling \nemphasizing effective management of resources, capacity of policy planners and administrators, \nand rates of return on investment in secondary education need to be improved. The progress of \ndecentralization and assessment of the need to build the capacity of local authorities should be \nreviewed. Based on the pilot study on the decentralized process of development of provincial \neducation plans supported by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, Cultural Organization \n(UNESCO), the World Bank (WB), and other aid agencies, there is a significant need for \ncontinuous  efforts  in  strengthening  decentralization.  Financial  sustainability  of  the  massive \ninvestments in the subsector should be carefully reviewed and monitored. These issues have \nmoved  to  the  forefront  and  dominate  the  educational  reform  agenda  in  the  country.  The \nGovernment and ADB have identified the need for refining the current SESMP to be more \ncomprehensive and responsive to immediate policy actions.  \n \n6.  Comprehensive Sector Review and Policy Planning. Preparing SESMP 2006\u20132010 \nwill begin with the review of achievements and constraints under the ongoing SESMP. While the \ncurrent SESMP focuses mainly on expansion of lower secondary education, the new SESMP \nshould be a more comprehensive program covering both lower and upper secondary education. \nThis will highlight the expected role of secondary education in equipping adolescents with basic \nacademic knowledge and appropriate and safe behavior in wider aspects of human resource \ndevelopment of the country. In addition, to function as the overall investment program providing \noverall managerial and financial planning baseline, SESMP 2006\u20132010 will project the future \ndemand for teachers, classrooms, textbooks, and other educational inputs needs.  \n \n7.  Harmonization with Aid Partners and Their Programs. Due to a limited consultation \nprocess  and  coordination  framework  for  preparing  the  ongoing  SESMP,  there  are  some \ninconsistencies in analytical methodologies and overlaps in target setting observed between the \nSESMP  and  other  development  plans  prepared  by  donor  partners.  The  National  Plan  for \nEducation for All (NPFEA) which partially covers lower secondary education as a part of basic \neducation, is particularly important among the concerned programs in the subsector. The new \nSESMP should maintain consistency with NPFEA to harmonize and maximize synergy and \nefficiency.  The  new  SESMP  will  also  include  a  common  investment  program  to  define \nresponsibility for aid agencies\u2019 coverage within the subsector, consistent with their technical \nexpertise and achievements. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), UNESCO, \nand United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) have agreed to participate in preparing SESMP \n2006\u20132010 and the coordination matrix through the PBA.3 \n                                                                                                                                                          \nof the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Teacher \nTraining Project.

ADB\u2019s initiative in the PBA under the TA will be closely coordinated with the practice in primary \neducation. \n ", "  3\n \n8.  Inclusive  Development  Approach.  The  policy  recommendations  for  targeted \nassistance to disadvantaged groups under the current SESMP are relatively broad. The new \nSESMP will conduct more extensive data collection and analysis through field surveys in the \nmost needy areas to determine the destabilizing factors of vulnerable groups and effective \nmeasures for risk mitigation. The following will be reviewed: the relevance and effectiveness of \nADB-funded targeted assistance to disadvantaged groups, recent trends among secondary \nschool leavers, linkage between primary and secondary education for curriculum requirements \nand consistencies, and the role of the private sector in providing secondary education. \n \n9.  The TA builds on ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for Viet Nam. The TA will help the \nGovernment achieve the MDGs and harmonize planning and implementation strategies among \ndevelopment  partners.  This  will  help  increase  effectiveness  and  sustainability  of  official \ndevelopment assistance resources. The TA is in line with ADB\u2019s Policy on Education and the \nearlier education projects as well as the policies for gender development and indigenous people.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The TA\u2019s primary purpose is to help the Government achieve (i) universal secondary \neducation with quality, equity, effectiveness, and sustainability; and (ii) MDGs by formulating a \nframework for more strategic sector policy planning, management, and aid harmonization. To \nrealize the goal, the TA aims to (i) conduct the secondary education subsector performance \nreview,  and  (ii)  prepare  a  new  SESMP  and  the  aid  coordination  matrix  with  a  common \ninvestment program for secondary education to be shared with other partners including JICA, \nUNESCO, and UNICEF. \n   \n11.  The TA\u2019s expected outputs are (i) SESMP 2006\u20132010 which will be subject to MOET \nmanagement\u2019s  approval,  (ii)  establishment  of  the  new  aid  coordination  mechanism  for \nsecondary  education  through  PBA,  (iii)  fiscal  analysis  to  achieve  financial  sustainability  of \nsecondary schooling, (iv) the time-bound action plan to mitigate the challenges that the most \nneedy groups including ethnic minorities and girls from disadvantaged families have been facing, \nand (v) a proposal for a nationwide school mapping study and projections of future demand for \nschool facilities. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The  TA  will  be  conducted  in  a  participatory  and  consultative  process  to  ensure \ncongruence  of  the  goals  of  the  Government  and  PBA  partners  as  well  as  that  of  local \neducational authorities and the expected beneficiaries. The TA will (i) emphasize the most \neffective aid harmonization modality to cover a wide range of required inputs to universalize \nsecondary  education,  (ii)  pay  close  attention  to  the  ongoing  decentralized  delivery  of \neducational services, (iii) adopt a result-oriented sector performance review and policy planning, \nand (iv) target the TA beneficiaries and define the expected deliverables more clearly.   \n \n13.  Key activities of the TA will include (i) reviewing education sector performance under \nSESMP 2001\u20132005, including a public expenditure review focusing on secondary education and \npreparing  the  new  policy  targets  and  strategies  for  achieving  equitable,  sustainable,  and \neffective universal secondary education up to 2010; (ii) establishing a new aid coordination \nmatrix and a common investment program to increase aid effectiveness and coverage; (iii) \nevaluating impacts of ADB\u2019s ongoing interventions in \u201ctargeted support\u201d to vulnerable groups \n ", "4   \nand proposing measures to mitigate obstacles to universalize lower secondary education in \nclose coordination with UNESCO and UNICEF; and (iv) reviewing the ongoing school-mapping \nexercises for both lower and upper secondary schools, proposing the most appropriate and \ntime- and cost-effective methodology for the nationwide mapping system and database, and  \nprojecting demands for education facilities and the associated budget requirements referring to \nthe actual costs under JICA\u2019s school construction projects.   \n \n14.  The  subsector  performance  including  public  expenditure  will  be  assessed  by  (i) \nreviewing related laws including SEDP 2006\u20132010, Youth Law, and Gender Equality Law; (ii) \nanalyzing  educational  management  information  system  (EMIS)  data  and    statistics;  (iii) \nreviewing aid agencies\u2019 project completion reports for secondary education related-activities; (iv) \nidentifying  gaps  in  access  to  and  attainments  of  secondary  education  based  on  gender \ngeographic features and income disparity; (v) evaluating the institutional capacity of central and \nlocal  education  authorities  for  fiscal  management  while  considering  decentralization;  (vi) \nassessing the new public financial management system, which is being funded by the World \nBank; and (vii) reviewing the United Nations Development Programme\u2019s study on the impact of  \nprivatization on the education sector.  \n \n15.  The new target assistance plan will be proposed after (i) examining the implications of \nsocioeconomic development policies on education; (ii) reviewing impacts and benefits of ADB\u2019s \ntarget assistance components under past and ongoing projects; (iii) identifying and targeting the \nmost needy groups; (iv) conducting field studies in selected provinces to collect segregated \neducational data and examine major factors affecting their enrollments, internal and external \nefficiency, and parents\u2019 awareness in the areas; and (v) drafting target assistance plans, which \nshould be sustainable and able to directly contribute to improving the most vulnerable groups\u2019 \naccess to secondary education. \n \n16.  The proposal for the national school mapping study will be prepared after (i) reviewing \nthe mapping data produced by ongoing ADB-funded projects, (ii) analyzing the demographic \ndata and census for secondary education age cohorts, (iii) assessing JICA\u2019s mapping exercises \nfor primary education, and (iv) conducting a comparative study on the methodologies and \nexpenditures for nationwide mapping. This study will include the projected demand in school \nfacilities. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The  TA  cost  is  estimated  at  $750,000  equivalent,  comprising  $370,000  in  foreign \nexchange cost and $380,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. ADB will finance $300,000 \nequivalent, on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan, \nand $300,000 equivalent will be financed on a grant basis by the Government of Denmark. The \nGovernment will finance the remaining local currency cost of $150,000 equivalent mostly in kind. \nThe cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  MOET will be the TA\u2019s Executing Agency and will provide counterpart support, including \na qualified TA project manager acceptable to ADB. A project steering committee (PSC) chaired \nby the vice minister of MOET will be established to oversee the quality of the TA outputs. Under \nthe guidance of the PSC, a project implementation unit consisting of representatives from \nMOET\u2019s  departments  including  planning  and  finance,  international  coordination,  personnel, \nsecondary education, and professional education will be set up. JICA, UNESCO, UNICEF, and \nADB will constitute a joint aid advisory body to (i) provide technical advice on the TA; (ii) \n ", "  5\nparticipate in preparing the coordination matrix and the investment program; and (iii) ensure the \nTA has links to the existing aid coordination mechanism for the whole sector, the education \nsector group.             \n \n19.  A team of five international (13 person-months) and seven domestic (40 person-months) \nconsultants will be recruited to provide consulting services. The international consultants will \nprovide  services  in  the  following  areas  (person-months  are  in  parenthesis):  (i)  team \nleader/education  policy  analysis  and  results-based  management  (6),  (ii)  public  expenditure \nanalysis and education economics (1.5), (iii) education facilities and maintenance and school \nmapping  (2.5),  (iv)  aid  agency  cooperation  coordination  (1),  and  (v)  inclusive  social \ndevelopment/gender  development  (2).  The  domestic  consultants  will  be  specialists  in  (i) \neducation policy analysis (6), (ii) fiscal analysis (5), (iii) education facilities (6), (iv) school \nmapping (6), (v) aid cooperation coordination (3), (vi) education statistics and planning (7), and \n(vii) inclusive social development and gender development (7). \n \n20.  All  international  consultants  except  the  inclusive  social  development/gender \ndevelopment specialist will be selected through a firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  using  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  in  the  simplified  technical \nproposal procedure and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB concerning the engagement of \ndomestic  consultants.  The  international  inclusive  social  development/gender  development \nspecialist  will  be  selected  as  an individual  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  since  the \nposition requires solid expertise in sociological analysis and experience in field research on \nselected ethnic minorities in the region. The inclusive social development/gender development \nspecialist will report to the international team leader, and the inputs and schedule will be \ncarefully coordinated with those from other consultants engaged through a firm. The outline \nterms of reference are in Appendix 3. \n \n21.  The TA will be carried out over 7 months in two phases starting in August 2005 with \ncompletion  in  March  2006.  Phase  1  is  for  6  months.  At  the  end  of  phase  1,  a  tripartite \nconference and an aid coordination meeting will be organized to review and discuss the findings \nand outputs of phase 1 activities. Considering the discussions and agreements in phase 1 \nconference, phase 2 will be carried out by the team leader and domestic consultants to finalize \nall the reporting requirements. All TA-financed goods and services will be procured by either the \nconsultants or ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n22.
