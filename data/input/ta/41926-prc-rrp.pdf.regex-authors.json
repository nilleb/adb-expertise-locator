Annually, the Project will generate 250.9 \ngigawatt-hours  of  electricity  from  wind  resources,  replace  the \nusage of 86,118 tons (t) of standard coal for power generation, \nreduce  carbon  dioxide  emissions  by  242,127  t,  and  conserve \n5,900 t of freshwater. \n   \nDevelopment Impact  The Project supports the strategy of the Government of the PRC \n(the  Government)  to  promote  renewable  energy  development, \naiming to increase the total installed capacity of wind power by \nabout five times, from 6.1 gigawatts in 2007 to 30.0 gigawatts by \n2020,  and  to  enlarge  the  share  of  renewable  energy  in  the \ncountry\u2019s power generation portfolio from 8% in 2007 to 20% in \n2020. The Project will lessen reliance on coal burning for power \ngeneration  and  abate  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  thereby \ncontributing  to  the  mitigation  of  global  warming  and  climate \nchange.  The  Project  will  enhance  the  utilization  of  indigenous \nrenewable  energy  resources,  improve  wind  farm  management \npractices,  provide  opportunities  for  job  creation  and  income \ngrowth, raise fiscal revenues, upgrade local infrastructure, and \nprotect the regional ecological environment, thereby contributing \nto poverty alleviation and sustainable development in the region. \n   ", "ii   \nProject Sponsors and  CECIC  is  the  only  national-level  enterprise  owned  by  the \nGuarantors  Government  that  is  specifically  tasked  with  improving  energy \nefficiency,  developing  renewable  energy,  and  protecting  the \nenvironment in the PRC. CECIC started as a government agency \nin the former State Planning Commission and was registered in \n1988 as a company under the PRC Company Law. Since 2003, it \nhas consolidated its operations in (i) wind power development; (ii) \nwaste  management,  including  biomass  power  generation;  (iii) \nwater supply and sanitation; and (iv) energy efficiency projects. \nCECIC attaches high priority to wind power development in its \nlong-term corporate development strategy. With a total of 996.5 \nmegawatt wind power facilities under operation, construction and \npreparation, CECIC has accumulated the capacity and experience \nto become an industry leader in designing, building, and operating \nlarge wind farms in the PRC.  \n \nEstablished in 1973 as Kumagai Gumi (Hong Kong) Limited, HKC \nhas  grown  over  the  last  35  years  into  one  of  Asia\u2019s  most \nspecialized  investors  and  contractors  for  civil  engineering, \ninfrastructure construction, and energy development. Listed on the \nHong Kong Stock Exchange, HKC has focused its developmental \nstrategy on commercial properties, infrastructure extension, and \nalternative energy.  \n   \nFinancial and Economic  Without  taking  into  consideration  revenues  from  the  sale  of \nPerformance of the  certified emission reductions, the Project is expected to yield a \nProject  financial  internal  rate  of  return  of  7.49%,  which  is  above  the \n  weighted average cost of capital. The Project\u2019s economic internal \n  rate of return is 17.4%, which indicates strong positive economic \n  externalities and is higher than the social discount rate of 12.0%.  \n \nEnvironmental and  The Project harnesses wind resources on undeveloped land and \nSocial Issues  affects no indigenous peoples. As the site is vacant, resettlement \nis  not  needed.  Disturbances  during  construction  will  be  small, \ntransient,  and  properly  managed.  Perceptible  environmental \nimpacts during operation will be mostly noise and visual intrusion, \nbut both are minimal because of the distance between the wind \nturbines and the nearest settlements and the relatively low scenic \nvalue of the project site. The Borrower has formulated a social \nand  environmental  management  plan  and  allocated  sufficient \nfunds to implement it to further minimize negative environmental \nand social impacts and to restore and protect the ecology of the \nproject site. \n \n ", "  iii\nJustifications   The  Project  merits  ADB  support  because  it  helps  promote \nsustainable  development  in  Hebei  Province  and  diversifies \nelectricity  production  toward  renewable  resources  in  an \nenvironmentally friendly way. The Project enhances public\u2013private \npartnerships and encourages foreign participation in wind power \ngeneration, which is crucial for the further development of the \nnascent sector. The Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s strategies for \nthe country and the energy sector. Meanwhile, the Project will \nsupport the efforts of leading clean energy developers to adopt \nand  deploy  advanced  low-carbon  technologies  and  generate \nsignificant demonstration effects to encourage other renewable \nenergy projects in the country. \n   \n ", "115 o 00'E 118 o 00'E\nZHANGBEI WIND POWER PROJECT Project County\nHebei Province\nIN THE\nNational Capital\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\nProvincial Capital\nCity/Town\nProject Site\nNational Road\nRailway\nI N N E R     M O N G O L I A\nRiver\nWeichang County Boundary\n42 o 00'N 42 o 00'N\nProvincial Boundary\nKangbao Boundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\nGuyuan\nLonghua\nN\nZhangbei Fengning\nShangyi Pingguan\nChongli\nChengde\n0 40 60 80 100\nWangquan Chicheng\nL I A O N I N G\nKilometers Zhangjiakou\n,\nHuai an\nXuanhua\nKuancheng\nHuailai\nXinglong Qinglong\nZhuolu\nYangyuan Zunhua Qianxi\nSanhe Qinhuangdao\nYu Xian BEIJING Yutian Lulong\nChangli\nS H A N X I Tangshan\n40 o 00'N Laishui Zhuozhou 40 o 00'N\nFengnan\nLaiyuan Yixian Gaobeidian Leting\nDingxing Yongqing\nTianjin Tanghai\nRongcheng\nXushui Bazhou\nMancheng Xongxian B o h a i     S e a\nFuping Shunping Baoding Anxin We,n an\nTang Xian\nRenqiu\n08 Quyang\n-42 Qingyuan Gaoyang Daicheng\n5\n5a E Xingtang 115 o 00'E Dingzhou Lixian Hejian Qing Xian 118 o 00'E\nG", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe CECIC HKE Wind Power Co., Ltd., for the Zhangbei Wind Power Project (the Project) in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The design and monitoring framework and the development \neffectiveness framework are in Appendixes 1 and 2. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Energy Sector Performance and Challenges in the PRC \n \n2.  The PRC has Asia\u2019s largest and fastest-growing energy sector, which has expanded at an \naverage  annual  rate  of  5.5%  since  1988  to  support  rapid  economic  growth  and  massive \nurbanization. The PRC\u2019s developmental goal of quadrupling its per capita gross domestic product \n(GDP) by 2020 from its 2000 level and its currently low energy consumption per capita indicate \npotential for strong growth in demand for energy for many years to come.1 The PRC attained a low \naverage energy\u2013GDP elasticity of 0.47 between 1980 and 2000. However, this elasticity increased \nsharply to 1.4 during the period between 2001 and 2005, due mainly to swift industrialization, \ninfrastructure development, and expanded household and commercial consumption. To alleviate \nchronic electricity shortages that had constrained economic development in many provinces, the \nPRC  installed  over  205  gigawatts  (GW)  of  power  generation  capacity  in  2006  and  2007.2 \nExcessive reliance on coal (accounting for 69% of the total primary energy supply) and increasing \ndependence on imported oil (accounting for more than 40% of the total oil consumption) have \ncaused  serious  concerns  about  environmental  degradation  and  energy  insecurity  and  could \nsignificantly affect global climate change and world energy markets.  \n \n3.  Coal, the most carbon dioxide (CO )-intensive fossil fuel, has been dominating energy \n2\nproduction and power generation in the PRC.3 About 82% of electricity was produced by burning \ncoal in 2007. The costs in terms of resource depletion, environmental deterioration, mining safety, \nand  public  health  associated  with  producing,  transporting,  and  consuming  coal  are  not  fully \nreflected in coal prices. Cleaner and renewable energy has been put at a disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis \ncoal, which has been implicitly subsidized for decades. Pollution caused by high coal usage is \naggravated by the economy\u2019s relatively low energy efficiency, which requires about 3.5 times more \nenergy per unit of economic output than the world average. Acid rain falls on one third of the \ncountry\u2019s territory and nearly half of its farmland. If current trends are not effectively curtailed, \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will increase rapidly, which will exacerbate global warming and \ninflict  heavy  social,  economic,  and  environmental  damage.  The  poor  would  suffer  first  and \nforemost, and remain the most vulnerable. \n \n4.  Recognizing that the current energy growth trajectory dominated by fossil fuels is neither \nenvironmentally  sustainable  nor  economically  desirable,  the  Government  of  the  PRC  (the \nGovernment)  has  made  strong  commitments,  established  a  series of  mandatory  targets,  and \nadopted incentive-based policies to improve energy efficiency, diversify the energy supply mix into \nrenewable  sources,  reduce  emissions,  and  abate  global  warming  and  climate  change.  In  its \nmedium- and long-term renewable energy development program promulgated in August 2007, the \nGovernment set the goal of producing 15% of its primary energy from renewable sources by 2020, \n                                                 \n1  Annual per capita electricity consumption in the PRC was relatively low at 2,500 kWh in 2007, which is about a quarter \nof the 9,786 kWh in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries in 2005.  \n2  The incremental capacity of 205 GW is larger than the combined generation capacity of Germany and the United \nKingdom in 2005 (198 GW) and is equivalent to building two 1.0 GW power plants every week. \n3  As the world\u2019s largest coal-producing and -consuming country, the PRC doubled its coal use within 5 years between \n2002 and 2007, when the total coal production reached 2.6 billion tons. More than 55% of coal is used to generate \nelectricity, with the rest used for industrial processes, space heating, and household consumption. ", "2      \nup from 7.5% in 2005. Development plans have been formulated to raise the share of electricity \nproduction from renewable sources from 8% in 2007 to 20% by 2020, mainly by constructing 30 \nGW of wind power (an increase of nearly 5 times from 6.1 GW in 2007), 20 GW of biomass and \nbiogas power, and 300 GW of hydropower. \n \nB.  Wind Power Development in the PRC \n \n5.  The PRC\u2019s vast land area and long coastline are endowed with abundant wind resources. \nThe China Meteorology Bureau concluded that,4 without taking into account the Qinghai-Tibetan \nPlateau, technically exploitable wind energy resources at a height of 10 meters (m) above the \nground  could  reach  2,548  GW.  About  75%  of  the  PRC\u2019s  rich  onshore  wind  resources  are \nconcentrated in the northwestern grasslands and the Gobi Desert, stretching from Inner Mongolia \nthrough Hebei, Ningxia, and Gansu to Xinjiang.5 A summary on wind power development in the \nPRC is presented in Appendix 3. \n \n6.  The  legal  and  regulatory  environment  for  renewable  energy  development  has  steadily \nimproved in recent years. The Renewable Energy Law, which became effective in January 2006, \nand its implementing policies provide financial stimulation for renewable energy, including the \nestablishment of national and regional renewable energy funds, the improvement of access to \nproject financing, and specific tax preferences. It has reduced risks for project developers by \nmandating power grid interconnection and full power offtake, as well as by providing guaranteed \nminimum prices or subsidies for certain types of renewable energy. For wind power projects \napproved by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the Renewable Energy \nLaw and its implementing policies require that (i) the grid utility be responsible for the construction \nof interconnecting transmission lines; (ii) the grid utility purchase all electricity generated; (iii) the \ntariff for uploading electricity to the power grid be determined through a nationwide concession \nbidding process; and (iv) the gap between the wind electricity tariff and the average electricity tariff \nbe shared across the whole power grid through a levy on each kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity \npurchased by end users.  \n \n7.  Fiscal incentives are provided to accelerate wind power development. The value-added tax \n(VAT) for wind power projects was reduced from 17% to 8.5%, since no fuel costs can be deducted \nfor wind power generation. The corporate income tax (at 25% of the gross profit) is waived for the \nfirst 3 years for wind farms constructed in the underdeveloped western region, which includes \nHebei  and  Inner  Mongolia.  Interest  during  construction  is  partly  subsidized.  Further,  the \nGovernment is considering adopting a mandatory quota system on renewable energy generation \nfor independent power producers. Meanwhile, wind power development is a high-priority of the \nnational  Clean  Development  Mechanism  (CDM),  enabling  wind  farms  with  more  than  50% \ndomestic ownership to sell certified emission reduction (CER) certificates under the terms of the \nUnited Nations\u2019 Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change. By September 2008, 39 wind power projects \nwere successfully registered with the United Nations\u2019 CDM executive board. \n \n8.  The PRC has strived to develop its wind resources over the last 2 decades but had \naccumulated only 345 megawatt (MW) of installed capacity by 2000, equivalent to a small coal-\nfired power plant. However, since the enactment of the Renewable Energy Law, the PRC has \nmade rapid strides in harnessing wind resources, doubling its wind power generation capacity each  \n \n                                                 \n4  The PRC National Climate Center. 2006. The China Wind Resource Assessment Report. Beijing. \n5  Within this narrow strip of about 200 km, the wind power density normally ranges from 200 watts per square meter \n(W/m2) to 300 W/m2 and can reach above 500 W/m2 in some regions with more favorable conditions. \n ", "  3\nyear.6 According to the Global Wind Energy Council, 3,155 wind turbines with a total capacity of \n3.45 GW were installed in the PRC in 2007. This addition raised the PRC\u2019s cumulative wind power \ncapacity to 6.1 GW,7 which consists of 158 wind farms across 21 provinces. Another 4.2 GW of \nwind power projects had been approved by the Government and were under construction in 2007.8   \n \n9.  Despite its rapid development in recent years, wind power remains insignificant in the \nnation\u2019s overall power mix, accounting for only 0.9% in its overall power generation capacity of \n713.6 GW and a meager 0.4% in its total electricity output of 3,263.2 terawatt-hours (TWh) in \n2007.9 Even doubling the current national target for wind power development by 2020 to 60.0 GW \nwill leave the wind power share below 5.0% of the estimated total power generation capacity in the \ncountry, which could grow to 1,200.0 GW at a moderate average annual growth rate of 4.1% \nduring the 13-year period between 2007 and 2020.  \n \n10.  Currently, more than 90% of wind farms are developed by large state-owned enterprises \n(SOEs), especially large power companies. Many private sector companies have demonstrated \ninterest  in  developing  wind  farms  but  have  found  that  the  financial  returns  on  wind  power \ninvestment are low, up-front costs for conducting wind resource assessment and obtaining all \nnecessary permits and authorizations are high, and technological uncertainties are difficult to \nhandle. Large SOEs have clear mandates from the Government to implement the medium- and \nlong-term renewable energy development program. They also have relatively stronger technical \ncapacity to undertake big wind power projects and larger asset portfolios to achieve economies of \nscale and absorb the risks of deploying new and advanced technologies.   \n \nC.  Development Challenges in Hebei Province \n \n11.  Hebei has a fast-growing but energy-intensive economy. With a population of 67.4 million \non a land area of 188,000 square kilometers (km2), Hebei had a GDP of CNY1,386.4 billion in \n2007, having achieved an average annual growth rate of 12.8% during the previous 5 years. More \nthan 80% of the province\u2019s total industrial outputs are produced by seven leading industries.10 \nEnergy consumption per CNY10,000 of GDP in Hebei was 1.84 tons (t) of standard coal equivalent \nin 2007, which is 59% higher than the national average of 1.16 t.   \n \n12.  Hebei faces substantial challenges for poverty alleviation and sustainable development. In \nspite of its fast growth, Hebei\u2019s per capita consumption in 2006 of CNY4,945 was 19% below the \nnational average of CNY6,111. Still, 39 of 592 nationally recognized impoverished counties are in \nHebei,  including  Zhangbei  County,  where  the  Project  is  located.  About  83%  of  Zhangbei\u2019s \npopulation of 370,800 in 2007 lived in rural areas, earning subsistence income from poor soils and \nremaining vulnerable to inclement climate. In 2006, the county\u2019s GDP was CNY2.5 billion, and the \nnet income per farmer was merely CNY2,773, which is less than $1 per day and among the lowest \nlevels in the PRC. To ensure the sustainability of its economic growth, Hebei needs to carefully \n                                                 \n6  In the medium- and long-term renewable energy development program, the national target for cumulative wind power \ncapacity was set at 5 GW by 2010 and 30 GW by 2020. The original goal for 2010 was achieved 3 years early, in \n2007, and was therefore raised to 10 GW. The reality is evolving so fast that this revised goal of 10 GW is likely to be \nexceeded in 2008 and could be raised again to a level surpassing 20 GW. \n7  The PRC\u2019s total wind power capacity ranked fifth in the world in 2007, after Germany (22.3 GW), United States (16.8 \nGW), Spain (15.1 GW), and India (8.0 GW). \n8  While the wind power capacity addition accounted for about 30% of the total incremental power generation capacity in \nthe United States and 40% in Europe in 2007, wind power accounted for less than 3% of newly commissioned capacity \nin the PRC in 2006 and 2007. Most new power generation facilities are going to burn coal and emit CO  for many \n2\ndecades to come. \n9  The current ratio between the electricity output and the generation capacity of wind power in the PRC reflects serious \nwind resource underutilization in existing wind farms, mainly caused by inadequate wind farm management, obsolete \ntechnologies, and poor equipment reliability. \n10 These industries are (i) iron and steel, accounting for more than 20% of the national total; (ii) machinery; (iii) \npetrochemicals; (iv) chemicals and pharmaceuticals; (v) food processing; (vi) construction materials; and (vii) textiles. \n ", "4      \naddress such constraining issues as limited water resources, sharp increases in energy demand, \nand rising pressures for environmental protection. \n \n13.  Energy consumption has severely outpaced energy production in Hebei in recent years, \ncausing frequent brownouts. Electricity production in Hebei grew by 12.7% in 2007, amounting to \n164.6 TWh generated from a total installed capacity of 30.2 GW. However, this expansion could \nsatisfy only 80% of electricity consumption in the province, which grew by 16.1% in 2007 to 204.1 \nTWh, leading to a high electricity\u2013GDP growth ratio of 1.26.11 This boom in demand for electricity \npushed up prices on coal for power generation in Hebei by 18.4%, from CNY380/t in 2006 to \nCNY450/t in 2007. \n \n14.  Rapid growth in electricity demand in the northern PRC will continue. According to the 11th \nFive-Year Development Plan for the North China Power Grid (NCPG), both the load volume and \nelectricity usage in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan area are estimated to double between 2006 and \n2020.  \n \nElectricity Demand Forecast, Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Tangshan Power Grid \n \nItem  2005  2010  2015  2020 \nElectricity Usage (GWh)   1,305   1,740    2,194   2,663 \nGrowth Index (2005=100)   100    133    168    204 \n \nMaximum Load (GW)   23    32    42  52 \nGrowth Index (2005=100)   100    139    183    226 \nGW = gigawatt, GWh = gigawatt-hour. \nSource: The North China Grid Company Limited. \n \n15.  About 97% of power distributed by the NCPG is generated from coal-burning. Hydropower \noptions  are  scant  in  the  region.  Significant  capacity  expansion  in  thermal  power  generation \nsubstantially increased demand for coal and GHG emissions. To diversify electricity supply into \nrenewable sources, abundant wind resources in Hebei and Inner Mongolia must be effectively \nutilized, as pioneered by wind power development in Zhangbei. Because of its rich wind resources, \nproximity to Beijing, excellent transportation network, and convenience for power grid integration, \nZhangbei was selected by NDRC as the PRC\u2019s first 1.0 GW wind power development district.  \n  \nD.  ADB Operations \n \n16.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  promotes  inclusive,  efficient,  equitable,  and \nsustainable economic growth to eliminate poverty across the Asia and Pacific region. In its long-\nterm strategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020), ADB identified energy as one of five core \noperational areas and achieving environmental sustainability as one of three strategic development \npriorities.12 ADB\u2019s operational focus for the energy sector hinges on addressing energy security \nand climate change by improving energy efficiency and enlarging the use of indigenous clean and \nrenewable energy. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC (2008\u20132010) concentrates on \nachieving  balanced  and  sustainable  growth  with  more  efficient  uses  of  resources  and  more \nstringent protection of the environment.13 In recent years, ADB has introduced new initiatives (e.g., \nthe Energy Efficiency Initiative and the Carbon Market Initiative [CMI]) and adopted more client-\noriented operational modalities (e.g., multitranche financing facilities) to reinforce its assistance to \ndeveloping  member  countries\u2019  acquisition  of  low-carbon  technologies  and  implementation  of \nenergy efficiency and renewable energy projects. \n                                                 \n11 Electricity consumption per CNY10,000 of GDP in Hebei actually increased from 1,487.6 kWh in 2005 to 1,515.9 kWh \nin 2006 and then to 1,579.8 kWh in 2007, for an increase of 6.2% in 2 years. \n12  ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n ", "  5\n17.  ADB  started  to  support  wind  power  development  in  the  PRC  in  1998  with  project \npreparatory technical assistance.14 At that time, the total installed wind power capacity in the \ncountry was merely 167 MW, and there were significant barriers, including the absence of a \nconducive legal and regulatory framework, the lack of appropriate target for renewable energy \ndevelopment, the poor availability and reliability of wind data, the limited domestic manufacturing \ncapacity, and the scarcity of accessible funds to implement clean technology projects. The ensuing \nproject loan, approved in 2000, included three wind power projects with a total capacity of 78 MW \nin Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and the provinces of Heilongjiang and Liaoning.15 However, \nin 2004, the Government withdrew the request and sought termination of the loan, mainly for lack \nof agreement with the provincial governments regarding appropriate tariffs. ADB continued its \npolicy dialogue with the Government on the need for a better regime to select wind power project \ndevelopers  competitively  and  to  establish  the  wind  power  tariff  transparently,  with  greater \nparticipation by the private sector and improved capacity in the domestic manufacturing industry. \nThese issues have been largely addressed following the enactment of the Renewable Energy Law. \n \n18.  The Project will extend ADB\u2019s continued support for the implementation of the PRC\u2019s 11th \nFive-Year  Development  Plan  (2006\u20132010),  which  attaches  high  priority  to  energy  efficiency, \nrenewable energy, and pollution reduction, as well as specifically requiring that financial assistance \nfrom  international  financial  institutions  be  used  for  resource  conservation,  environmental \nimprovement, and infrastructure development. The Project will learn and incorporate lessons from \nADB\u2019s earlier renewable energy projects, with the emphasis on improving project design, financing \nstructure, risk mitigation, implementation arrangements, and demonstration effects. \n \n19.  ADB\u2019s  nonsovereign  operations  have  traditionally  focused  on  assisting  private  sector \nenterprises. The proposed Project explores an innovative approach to support renewable energy \ndevelopment led by a large SOE and implemented by a Sino-foreign joint venture. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Description \n \n20.  Through  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB)  organized  by  NDRC,  China  Energy \nConservation Investment Corporation (CECIC) won concession rights for 25 years to develop a \nwind power project of 100.5 MW on a build-operate-own basis at L\u00fcnaobao in Zhangbei. The \nProject is the sixth wind power farm developed by CECIC in Zhangbei and is strategically situated \nbetween the load centers of Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan and the southeastern rim of the Inner \nMongolia  Plateau,  where  wind  energy  resources  are  exceptionally  abundant.16 More  than  10 \ncompanies are currently developing or operating wind farms in or near Zhangbei. The project site \nis well connected by road and close to the main power transmission network. \n \n21.  Within a land area of 4,182 km2, Zhangbei experiences frequent and strong southbound \nwinds,  which  rapidly  sweep  from  Siberia  toward  the  North  China  Plain.  The  commercially \nexploitable wind resources in Zhangbei are estimated to be 5.0 GW. The average annual wind \nvelocity is 8.4 meters per second (m/s), and the average annual wind energy density is 492.3 watts \nper square meter (w/m2) at a height of 70 m. The frequencies for five wind directions sum up to \n71.5%. The probability for the wind velocity ranging between 3 m/s and 25 m/s stands at 99.96%. \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 1998. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Wind Power Development Project. Manila \n(TA 3071-PRC for $600,000). \n15 ADB. 2000. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for the Wind Power Development Project. Manila (Loan 1818-PRC for $58 million). \n16 The project site is centered at 114o32\u201930\u201d east longitude and 41o03\u201950\u201d north latitude, about 242 km northwest of \nBeijing. The altitude of the project site ranges from 1,500 m to 1,600 m above the mean sea level. \n ", "6      \nThe once-every-50-years maximum wind velocity averaged over a 10-minute interval is estimated \nto be 41.1 m/s. \n \n22.  The  Project  will  install  67  wind  turbine  generators  (WTGs)  on  ridges  ascending  from \nnorthwest to southeast, perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction. Each WTG will have a rotor \ndiameter of 77.0 m, a hub height of 61.5 m, and a rated output of 1.5 MW. Under the equipment \nsupply contract, the manufacturer provides a 24 month warranty, which guarantees a per unit WTG \nyield curve of no less than 95% of the guaranteed value and an average WTG availability of no \nless than 95% of the applicable availability percentage for all units of the wind farm collectively.  \n \n23.  The power generated by WTGs will be stepped up from 0.69 kilovolts (kV) to 35 kV and \nthen pooled through a power collection system to a substation located inside the wind farm. The \npooled power will be further stepped up to 220 kV and metered at the substation. Finally, the \npower will be fed from the substation into NCPG through 220 kV lines.  \n \n24.  The main activities for the Project consist of the following: \n(i)  constructing a paved access road of 1.8 kilometers (km) from the main road to the \nwind farm and internal service roads branching to individual WTGs; \n(ii)  laying  foundations  for  67  towers,  67  transformers,  and  1  substation,  including \nexcavation,  backfilling  thick  slabs  of  reinforced  concrete,  and  restoring  the \nsurrounding ground; \n(iii)  erecting 67 towers and installing and testing 67 WTGs; \n(iv)  installing and testing 67 box-type 35 kV transformers of 1.6 megavolt amperes and \na 220 kV voltage-upstaging substation of 120 megavolt amperes;  \n(v)  installing power collection cables and lightning protection devices;  \n(vi)  installing a monitoring, control, and data-collection system to serve all WTGs; \n(vii)  constructing offices, warehouses for spare parts, and a dormitory for 30 workers and \ntechnicians who will carry out daily operation and maintenance (O&M) works; and \n(viii)  conducting site vegetation recovery and maintenance.  \n \n25.  In addition to adopting advanced WTGs that can extract more energy from the same swept \narea than most conventional designs, the Project will introduce two new features: (i) weather \npattern  analysis  that  will  improve  predictability  and  thus  dispatch  scheduling  of  wind  power \ngeneration, which is a key concern regarding most forms of renewable energy, and (ii) an improved \nO&M regime that strengthens reliability, reduces WTG downtime, and enhances overall cost-\neffectiveness during the whole operation period of the wind farm. \n \n26.  The Project has obtained certain regulatory and statutory approvals and permits, including \nthe formal project approval from NDRC, power grid integration agreement from the State Power \nGrid  Company  and  approval  on  the  environmental  impact  assessment  from  the  Hebei \nEnvironmental Protection Bureau.  \n \n27.  Site preparation for the Project started in early 2008. The contracts for procuring WTGs and \ntowers were concluded in mid-2008 through NCB. Civil and electric works will be completed by \nqualified  contractors  selected  on  a  quality  and  cost  basis  through  NCB.  An  experienced \nindependent project-supervision team is engaged to ensure implementation on time, within budget, \nand of high quality. Project completion is planned for the end of 2009. Procurement processes so \nfar meet all governmental requirements. The main goods and services are procured competitively \nfrom the market, and all are from ADB member countries. \n \n \n \n ", "  7\nB.  Project Sponsors \n \n28.  The project sponsors are CECIC and HKC  (Holdings) Limited (HKC). Both have  vast \nindustry experience and strong financial capability for developing renewable energy projects in the \nPRC. They are now jointly developing three wind power projects with a combined capacity of 500 \nMW.17 CECIC and HKC have also collaborated in implementing and operating a waste-to-energy \ncogeneration project in Linyi, Shandong Province.18  \n \n29.  A Sino\u2013foreign joint venture indirectly owned by CECIC and HKC will be established under \nthe name of the CECIC HKE Wind Power Co., Ltd., and registered with the Ministry of Commerce \nof the PRC as a special purpose vehicle to implement the Project. Such a joint-venture structure \nlays down a solid foundation for enhancing corporate governance, ensuring financial transparency, \nand channeling foreign borrowings.19 The joint venture will derive strong management, technical, \nand financial support from its parent companies. A description of the joint-venture partners is \npresented in the following sections and Appendix 4. \n \n1.  The China Energy Conservation Investment Corporation \n \n30.  With headquarters in Beijing, CECIC is a Government-owned corporation administered \ndirectly  by  the  State-Owned  Assets  Supervision  and  Administration  Commission  of  the  State \nCouncil. CECIC is the sole national SOE in the PRC specifically tasked with designing, financing, \nand operating projects to improve energy efficiency, develop renewable energy, and protect the \nenvironment. CECIC started in the early 1980s in response to the second international oil crisis as \nthe  Energy  Conservation  Planning  Bureau  in  the  former  State  Planning  Commission,  the \nforerunner of NDRC. It was empowered with the responsibility to allocate and manage state energy \nconservation investment funds. In 1988, the State Council commercialized these functions and \nregistered CECIC as a corporation with its own legal identity under the PRC Company Law. \n \n31.  To  support  the  Government\u2019s  commitments  toward  comprehensively  utilizing  and \nconserving resources, including energy and water, and building an environmentally friendly society, \nCECIC  has  pioneered  new  technologies  and  developed  demonstration  projects  for  energy \nefficiency and pollution control. In the past 20 years, CECIC has completed more than 3,000 large \nand important energy conservation and renewable energy development projects in 13 subsectors \nin  more  than  300  municipalities.20 Total  accumulated  investment  exceeded  CNY55.0  billion, \nserving  both  fast-growing  coastal  provinces  and  resource-abundant  inland  regions.  Currently, \nCECIC treats and recycles more than 2.0 million ton (Mt) of industrial wastes and 260 Mt of \nwastewater per year. These projects have delivered significant environmental benefits, including (i) \nannual energy savings equal to 45.8 Mt of standard coal, (ii) annual chemical oxygen demand \nreductions amounting to 75,000 t, and (iii) annual CO  emission reductions of 105.0 Mt. Looking \n2\nahead, CECIC has set new investment targets that can additionally save 4.3 Mt of coal, reduce \n                                                 \n17 The other two wind power projects are (i) the 2006 national concession project of 200 MW at Danjinghe, Zhangbei, \nHebei, with a total investment of CNY1.6 billion by CECIC (60%) and HKC (40%), which is less than 20 km away from \nthe proposed project site, and (ii) the 2007 national concession project of 200 MW at Changma, Gansu.  \n18 This waste-to-energy plant, operational from 2007, is jointly owned and operated by CECIC (60%) and HKC (40%). \nThe total investment was CNY260 million. Using circulating fluidized bed technology, the plant processes 300,000 t of \nwaste, generates 200 GWh of electricity, and supplies 1.8 million gigajoules of heat annually. It derives revenues from \nthe garbage processing fee and sales of electricity, steam, and ash, as well as from CDM credits. \n19 According to existing investment guidelines, a joint venture with more than 25% foreign equity is authorized to borrow \nlong-term from foreign sources up to the gap between the total project cost and the sponsors\u2019 equity contributions. \n20 These include 450 cogeneration projects with a combined capacity of 10,000 MW, more than 100 urban natural gas \nsupply and distribution projects with a combined capacity of 13.93 million cubic meters per day, district heating projects \nservicing more than 200 million square meters, coal washing and treatment with the capacity of 59.7 Mt per year, and \nwastewater treatment with the capacity of 110 million cubic meter per year for paper making and food processing \nindustries.  \n ", "8      \nCO  emissions by 11.1 Mt, cut chemical oxygen demand by 0.4 Mt, and process 5.0 Mt of \n2\nindustrial wastes per year by 2012.  \n \n32.  CECIC currently owns or holds majority shares of 15 second-level subsidiary companies \nand more than 60 third-level subsidiary companies. To grow further, CECIC intends to raise more \nequity capital through an initial public offering in a domestic or international stock exchange in \nabout 3 years. In its long-term corporate development strategy, CECIC concentrates 80% of its \ntotal assets in the following four areas: (i) wind power development; (ii) waste management, \nincluding biomass power generation; (iii) water supply, wastewater treatment, and sanitation; and \n(iv)  energy  efficiency  improvement  and  resource  conservation.  In  recent  years,  CECIC  has \nimproved its corporate governance structure and formulated an action plan to fulfill its corporate \nsocial responsibilities. \n \n33.  To break bottlenecks in WTG supplies and to absorb advanced wind power technologies, \nCECIC acquired 50% of the second-largest domestic WTG manufacturer, the Zhejiang Windey \nWind Generating Engineering Co., Ltd., (Zhejiang Windey) in June 2006. Zhejiang Windey has \nmature technologies for 800 kilowatt (kW) WTGs and is now designing and manufacturing 1.5 MW \nWTGs in cooperation with a leading European wind turbine design company.  \n \n34.  CECIC\u2019s investment in wind power development is channeled through its wholly owned \nsubsidiary specialized in wind energy investment, the CECIC Wind Power Investment Co. (CECIC-\nWPI), which was established in January 2006. For specific projects in different locations, project \ncompanies are set up to work with different equity partners and long-term debt providers. \n \n35.  CECIC-WPI has accumulated sufficient capacity and experience to become an industry \nleader in implementing and operating large wind farms. CECIC-WPI now takes the lead in (i) \noperating  four  wind  farms  with  a  combined  capacity  of  244.5  MW  in  Hebei  and  Xinjiang; \n(ii) constructing two new wind farms with a combined capacity of 249.5 MW in Zhangbei, Hebei; \nand (iii) developing three wind farms with a combined capacity of 502.5 MW in Hebei and Gansu. \nAiming to occupy 10% of the PRC\u2019s wind power market, CECIC-WPI has conducted wind resource \nmeasurement and reserved developmental rights in Inner Mongolia, Hainan, and Fujian for about \n2,000 MW and has plans to harness 1,500 MW of wind power by 2012. CERs from five CECIC \nwind farms have been successfully registered with the CDM executive board.  \n \n36.  Cooperation between CECIC and ADB started in 1998 when ADB funded a small-scale \ntechnical  assistance  project  to  assess  and  enhance  CECIC\u2019s  capacity.21 While  CECIC  was \ngenerally considered to be a strong SOE, certain internal requirements of the PRC prevented \nADB\u2019s sovereign assistance. \n \n2.  HKC (Holdings) Limited \n \n37.  Established in 1973 as Kumagai Gumi (Hong Kong) Limited, HKC has grown over the past \n35  years  to  become  one  of  Asia\u2019s  specialized  investors,  developers,  and  contractors  in  civil \nengineering, infrastructure, energy, and building development. HKC has gained reputation and \nexperience in designing and implementing large infrastructure projects, most notably in Hong \nKong,  China,  and  the  PRC.  It  has  built  or  engineered  some  of  the  world\u2019s  most  impressive \nconstruction projects, including the world\u2019s 7th, 8th, and 11th tallest buildings.  \n \n                                                 \n21\n ADB. 1997. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Capacity Building for Energy Conservation. \nManila (TA 2870-PRC, approved on 18 September, for $78,000). The technical assistance assessed CECIC\u2019s capacity \nto serve as an intermediary utilizing ADB financing. \n \n ", "  9\n38.  HKC\u2019s long-term development strategy focuses on property, infrastructure, and alternative \nenergy in the PRC and other regions in Asia. Its investments in the PRC have focused mainly in \nthe following areas:  \n(i)  Property  investment.  Capitalizing  on  its  extensive  PRC  relationships  and \nconstruction expertise, HKC has made large investments in real estate markets in \nBeijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Tianjin, and Nanxun.  \n(ii)  Infrastructure development.  HKC has invested in several infrastructure projects in \nthe PRC, including a toll road in Guilin and a water treatment facility in Hainan. \n(iii)  Alternative energy. HKC has made sizeable investments in clean and renewable \nenergy in the PRC, expanding its involvement in the wind power, biofuel, and waste-\nto-energy businesses, and planning to develop more wind farms in Heilongjiang, \nHebei, Gansu, and Inner Mongolia.   \n \n39.  HKC conducted its initial public offering in 1987 on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong \n(Stock No. 0190). In April 2004, Creator Holdings Limited became HKC\u2019s majority shareholder. As \npart  of  HKC\u2019s  restructuring,  Cerberus  Asia Capital  Management,  LLC,  and  Penta  Investment \nAdvisers, Ltd., took major equity stakes in October 2007, and are now the second and third largest \nstakeholders in HKC, respectively. In recognition of its rapid growth and increasing business \ninfluence, HKC was selected as a constituent stock in the Hang Seng composite indexes, effective \nfrom 15 October 2008. \n \n40.  In March 2008, HKC acquired a 74.99% interest in JIC Technology Company, Ltd, which \nwas also listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (Stock No. 987). The latter's name was then \nchanged  to  Hong  Kong  Energy  (Holdings),  Ltd.  (HKE).  All  of  HKC\u2019s  new  investment  in  the \nalternative  energy  business,  including  its  equity  contribution  to  the  proposed  Project,  will  be \nchanneled through HKE, which is now a majority-owned specialized subsidiary of HKC. \n \n41.  HKC\u2019s financial practices and information disclosure are regulated by the Stock Exchange \nof Hong Kong. \n \nC.  Project Operational and Financial Performance \n \n42.  The capacity factor of the Project is projected to be 28.5%, yielding 2,497 hours (h) of \noperation at full-capacity equivalent to supply 250.9 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of clean electricity per \nyear. In accordance with the Renewable Energy Law, NCPG will construct transmission lines and \npurchase all the electricity generated by the Project. Recently, NDRC decided to implement a new \nscheduling and dispatch system to encourage energy-efficient and environmentally friendly power \ngeneration. This new system gives first priority to, and maximizes the use of, renewable energy \nthat  cannot  be  stored,  such  as  wind,  solar,  and  marine  energy,  as  well  as  run-of-the-river \nhydropower.  \n \n43.  As one of five regional grids under the State Power Grid, NCPG bears responsibility for \nsafeguarding power supply to the PRC capital, Beijing, and providing reliable power services to \nsupport economic and social development in the northern PRC. Its grid covers a land area of 1.63 \nmillion km2 and serves a population of 230 million. By 2007, the total installed power generation \ncapacity on NCPG was 145 GW, of which about 30% was in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan area. A \nbrief introduction to the power offtaker is provided in Appendix 5. \n \n44.  A tariff of CNY0.5006/kWh for the first 30,000 h of full-capacity operation, including the \nVAT,  has  been  determined  through  the  concession  bidding  process  and  approved  by  the \nGovernment. At this tariff, the Project's annual electricity sales revenue will be CNY125.6 million. \nAfter the first 30,000 h of full-capacity operation, which lasts for about 12 calendar years, the tariff \nwill be adjusted to the average for electricity uploaded to the power grid. \n ", "10     \n45.  On 29 June 2008, NDRC raised the tariff for thermal power plants in northern Hebei by \nCNY0.016/kWh  to  reflect  the  increased  coal  price.  For  new  thermal  power  plants  with \ndesulphurization facilities in northern Hebei, the upload tariff was raised to CNY0.3664/kWh, an \nincrease of 4.57%. A review of historic tariff adjustments yields a conservative assumption that the \nupload tariff will continue to be gradually adjusted by an average annual rate of 2.5%. This \nindicates that the average upload tariff for NCPG will be around CNY0.5177/kWh when the Project \nhas completed its first 30,000 h of full capacity equivalent operation.  \n \n46.  With normal wind conditions, the Project will start to generate financial profits in the first \nyear of its full operation, since it has stable sales revenues with a predetermined tariff and zero fuel \ncosts. Its direct operational costs are mainly for maintenance and repairs, and thus relatively small.  \nDue to the large up-front capital investment for the Project, depreciation and interest payments will \naccount for a big portion of the operational costs, especially in the early years during the Project's \noperational period. The Project's financial asset structure will improve gradually with a declining \ndebt\u2013equity ratio, since the long-term debts will be amortized over time.  \n \n47.  Without considering the revenues from the sale of CERs, the Project is expected to yield a \nfinancial internal rate of return (FIRR) of 7.49%, which is above the weighted average cost of \ncapital at 2.75%. With revenues from CERs, the FIRR will be enhanced to 9.24%. The risk \ntolerance  levels  of  the  Project  have  been  stress-tested  with  breakeven  analysis,  sensitivity \nanalysis, and scenario comparison. The financial evaluation of the Project is presented in Appendix \n6. \n \n48.  Strong  growth  in  electricity  consumption  in  the  northern  PRC  means  that  all  power \ngenerated by the Project will be used to meet incremental demand. Value-added and corporate \nincome taxes from the Project amount to CNY554.6 million over the project life, contributing \nsubstantial fiscal revenues to support local development,22 which helps solidify government support \nfor the Project. The economic internal rate of return stands at 17.4%, which indicates strong \npositive economic externalities and is higher than the social discount rate of 12.0%. Sensitivity \nanalyses and scenario simulations demonstrate that the Project is economically justifiable and \nrobust under all foreseeable circumstances. The economic evaluation of the Project is presented in \nAppendix 7. \n \nD.  Environmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n \n49.  The Project has been classified as category B under ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) \nbecause it is unlikely to create any significant adverse environmental impact during construction or \noperation.  A  comprehensive  environmental  impact  assessment  for  the  Project,  including \nenvironmental and social site visits and community consultations, was completed in November \n2008 in line with ADB\u2019s environmental safeguard policies for environmental category B projects. \nThe summary initial environmental examination for the Project is presented in Appendix 8. \n \n50.  The perceptible negative environmental impacts such as noise and visual intrusion are \nnegligible, mainly because of the considerable distance between the turbines and the nearest \nsettlements. WTGs will not endanger migratory birds or bats, as there are few in the wind farm \narea, which is not located in the main habitat or along the main migration routes of migratory birds. \nIn fact, extensive wind power development will help reduce wind speeds by extracting energy from \nair flows, and thus help mitigate the sandstorms that frequently affect the northern PRC and \nthereby  reverse  desertification.

Implementing  a  carefully  designed  social  and \nenvironmental management plan, which includes monitoring arrangements, will further mitigate \nthese negative impacts. \n \n51.  The Project is classified as category C under ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). \nLand acquired for it is mostly barren and undeveloped, requiring minimal arrangements for land \nacquisition and preparation. WTGs and transmission towers will be erected on uninhabited land \nand will not cause displacement, affect any physical structures, necessitate any resettlement, or \ncause any loss of livelihood. No indigenous or forest-dependent people live close to or within the \nproject site. Hence, the Project is classified as category C under ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous \nPeoples (1998), and an indigenous peoples\u2019 plan is not required. \n \nE.  Development Impact \n \n1.  Impact, Outcome, and Output \n \n52.  The impact of the Project is reduced GHG emissions per unit of GDP in the PRC by at least \n15% by 2015 from its 2005 level. The outcome of the Project is an increased share of renewable \nenergy in total energy consumption in the PRC, from 7.5% in 2005 to 10% by 2010. The output of \nthe Project is the 100.5 MW wind power generation facility, power transformers, a booster station, \na control and monitoring system, and associated infrastructure and ancillary works completed on \ntime and within budget.  \n \n2.  Development Effectiveness \n \n53.  The development effectiveness of the Project has been assessed in terms of sustainable \neconomic  development,  inclusive  growth,  business  success,  and  private  sector  development, \nfollowing the guidelines for implementing the Good-Practice Standards for Evaluation of Private \nSector Investment Operations as prepared by the Evaluation Cooperation Group of the multilateral \ndevelopment banks.23  \n \n54.  The  Project  promotes  sustainable  economic  development  by  (i)  providing  a  large  and \npredictable amount of zero-emission electricity to mitigate power shortages in the northern PRC \nthat have frequently constrained the development of regional manufacturing and service industries; \n(ii) replacing the usage of 2.0 Mt of standard coal for electricity production and reducing CO  \n2\nemissions by 5.6 Mt during its concession period, thereby improving the local environment and \nabating global warming and climate change; and (iii) enhancing the country\u2019s energy security by \nsubstituting energy imports with indigenous renewable energy sources equivalent to up to 1.5 Mt of \noil during its concession period. \n \n55.  The  Project  contributes  to  inclusive  growth  by  (i)  creating  job  opportunities  for  local \ncommunities  during  construction  and  operation  and  stimulating  the  expansion  of  local \nmanufacturing and service industries, mostly related to assembling, transporting, installing, and \nrepairing  wind  power  equipment,  constructing  access  roads  and  foundations,  and  developing \necotourism focused on wind energy capture and utilization; (ii) increasing the income of rural \nfamilies through land-lease fees and the purchase of local products and services; (iii) improving \nphysical infrastructure by upgrading transport, power transmission, and telecommunication facilities \nin the region; (iv) enlarging the revenues of the local government by paying various local taxes and \nsurcharges, as well as fees for resource use; and (v) facilitating poverty alleviation targeted at the \n                                                 \n23 Multilateral Development Banks Evaluation Cooperation Group. 2001.

The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is presented in Appendix 9. \n \n56.  The Project encourages and catalyzes more proactive participation by the private sector \nand foreign investors in renewable energy development by (i) establishing a business model that \nprovides financial and technical assistance to enable a Sino-foreign joint venture to construct and \noperate a large wind power project, with the goal of quickly replicating this model in other relatively \nunderdeveloped  northwestern  provinces;  (ii)  delivering  demonstration  effects  for  future  private \nsector  investments  in  the  wind  power  sector  on  the  optimal  exploitation  of  wind  resources, \ndeployment of more efficient and reliable technologies, adoption of more prudent risk identification \nand mitigation practices, and introduction of international standards for environmental and social \nsafeguards; and (iii) developing a nonsovereign financing modality to accelerate renewable energy \nprojects. In addition, the Project helps to remove uncertainties for wind power project financing, \ngives potential investors and financiers a better understanding of the intrinsic risk factors in wind \npower development, and encourages large wind power projects that would deliver economy-of-\nscale benefits to reduce unit costs.   \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Proposed Loan \n \n57.  The proposed ADB loan will consist of a direct loan funded by ADB from its ordinary capital \nresources and, to the extent that cofinancing is made available under ADB\u2019s B loan program, a B \nloan funded by international banks. The loan funded by ADB from its ordinary capital resources will \nbe for up to $34.3 million, with a tenor of 14.5 years from the date of the first disbursement, \nincluding a grace period of 18 months. The interest rate and finance charges for the loan will be \napproved by ADB\u2019s pricing and credit enhancement committee. To the extent that cofinancing is \nmade available under ADB\u2019s B loan program, the loan will include a B loan for up to $56.2 million \nfunded by international banks. Any B loan will have a tenor of up to 14.5 years from the date of the \nfirst disbursement and be subject to such other terms and conditions as may be mutually agreed to \nby the Borrower and the participating banks, with the concurrence of ADB.     \n \n58.  Certain domestic financial institutions have expressed interest in providing local currency \nfunding to the Borrower through a parallel loan. If domestic financial institutions participate in \nfinancing the Borrower, the amount available for participation under the B loan will be diminished to \nthe extent of that participation. \n \n59.  The  proposed  loan  will  be  documented  in  a  loan  agreement  containing  terms  and \nconditions typically included in loans to private sector borrowers without governmental guarantees, \nas well as representations and covenants confirming or requiring compliance with ADB\u2019s policies. \nThe loan will be subject to conditions precedent to disbursement, including all contractual and \nfinancial arrangements satisfactory to ADB. \n \nB.  Justification \n \n60.  The Project is suitable for ADB support mainly for the following reasons: \n(i)  It  is  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  strategies  for  power  sector  reform  and \nrenewable  energy  development,  supporting  economic  growth  and  energy \ndiversification in an environmentally sustainable manner, and reducing the country\u2019s \ndependence on fossil fuels. The Project is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy and energy sector road map, complementing ADB\u2019s efforts to help the PRC \nachieve a low-carbon growth pattern.  \n ", "  13\n(ii)  It stimulates financial innovation for renewable energy development. The CMI will be \nutilized to provide up-front financing against future credits from CERs.  \n(iii)  The Project promotes public\u2013private partnerships in clean and renewable energy \ndevelopment.  ADB  plays  a  catalytic  role  to  mobilize  financing  and  risk-taking \ncapacity from reputable international and domestic financial institutions and to cut \ntransaction costs through appropriate loan syndication. \n(iv)  The Project directly contributes to mitigating global warming and climate change by \nconserving resources and reducing GHG emissions, as compared with a business-\nas-usual approach for generating electricity by combusting fossil fuels. \n(v)  The Project helps deliver ADB\u2019s value addition. ADB\u2019s assistance will generate \nsignificant demonstration effects for other wind farms, especially in the areas of \ndeploying advanced technologies, improving risk identification and management, \nand introducing international standards for environmental and social safeguards. \n(vi)  The Project contributes to poverty reduction and promotes sustainable development \nin the project area. \n \n61.  Large specialized SOEs in the PRC\u2019s energy sector have relatively strong financial and \ninstitutional  capacity  to  implement  projects  that  adopt  advanced  technologies  carrying  certain \ninherent uncertainties. Once these advanced technologies have been successfully deployed, more \npublic and private sector sponsors and financiers will have a better understanding on the intrinsic \nrisks and be encouraged to develop and operate similar projects.   \n \nC.  Main Risks and Mitigation Measures \n \n62.  The  Project  is  technically  reliable,  financially  viable,  economically  sustainable, \nenvironmentally  friendly,  and  fully  protected  by  the  national  Renewable  Energy  Law  and \nGovernment support for tariff determination, power grid integration, and uploading 100% of output. \nThe main risks of the transaction have been identified and their mitigation measures have been \ndesigned.  \n \nD.  Investment Limitations \n \n63.  The proposed loan will be within ADB\u2019s single, group, sector, and country exposure limits \nfor nonsovereign investments. A list of ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations in the PRC is presented in \nAppendix 10. \n \nE.  Anticorruption  Policy,  and  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of \nTerrorism \n \n64.  The Borrower will be advised of ADB's policies on anticorruption24 and combating of money \nlaundering and the financing of terrorism.25 Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB will require the Borrower to institute, maintain, and comply \nwith  internal  procedures  and  controls  following  international  best  practice  standards  for  the \npurpose of preventing corruption or money laundering activities or the financing of terrorism and \ncovenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from  engaging  in  such  activities.  The  financing  documentation \nbetween ADB and the Borrower will further allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential \nviolation of these undertakings. \n \n \n                                                 \n24 ADB. 1998.

The vast area and long coastline of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) are endowed \nwith  abundant  wind  resources.  According  to  the  Third  Nationwide  Survey  of  Wind  Energy \nResources organized by the China Meteorological Administration in 2004\u20132005, the PRC has a \ntotal exploitable wind energy reserve of 4,350 gigawatts (GW). About 1,000 GW onshore and \n200 GW offshore can be commercially developed with currently existing technologies. The \nonshore wind resources, with wind power intensity of over 150 watts per square meter (W/m2), \nare located across 200,000 square kilometers (km2), at an average intensity of 5.0 megawatts \n(MW) per km2. The United Nations Environment Program concluded in 2006 that the PRC\u2019s \ntechnically exploitable wind energy resource at 50 meters (m) above ground would reach 1,400 \nGW. The China Wind Resource Assessment Report by the National Climate Center of the China \nMeteorology Bureau, published in December 2006, demonstrated a much higher estimate, \nconcluding that technically exploitable wind energy resources at a height of 10 m above ground \ncould reach 2,548 GW, without taking into account the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.  \n \n2.  About  75%  of  the  PRC\u2019s  rich  onshore  wind  resources  are  concentrated  in  the \nnorthwestern grasslands and the Gobi Desert, stretching from Inner Mongolia through Hebei, \nNingxia, and Gansu to Xinjiang. Within this narrow strip about 200 kilometers (km) wide, wind \npower density normally ranges from 200 W/m2 to 300 W/m2 and can reach above 500 W/m2 in \nsome regions with the most favorable conditions. \n \n3.  With  low  population  density  on  large  territories,  these  northwestern  provinces  are \nrelatively underdeveloped, with lower per capita gross domestic product (GDP) than the eastern \nand coastal provinces but holding abundant natural resources for future development. Land \nsuitable for wind power development in these provinces is mostly barren, requiring minimal \narrangements  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  Environmental  harm  such  as  avian \ncasualties, noise, and visual intrusion are negligible. Extensive wind power development will \nhelp  reduce  wind  speeds  by  extracting  energy  from  air  flows  and  thus  help  alleviate  the \nsandstorms that frequently affect the northern PRC and thereby reverse desertification. \n \n4.   Zhangbei County, Hebei Province, where the proposed Project is located, is 242 km \nnorthwest of Beijing. It is strategically situated between the load centers of Beijing, Tianjin, and \nTangshan  and  the  southeastern  brim  of  the  Inner  Mongolia  Plateau,  where  wind  energy \nresources are exceptionally abundant. The average wind speed in a typical year at a height of \n65 m is 7.64 meter per second, and the average wind energy density is 378.6 W/m2. Zhangbei \nhas an estimated 5.0 GW of wind resources that can be commercially developed with existing \ntechnologies, of which 1.5 GW will be developed by the end of 2010. \n \nB.  Steady Improvement of the Regulatory Framework \n \n5.  Recognizing the staggering challenge of ensuring that ongoing energy growth be both \nenvironmentally  sustainable  and  economically  desirable,  the  Government  of  the  PRC  (the \nGovernment) has made a strong commitment to improving energy efficiency on the demand \nside and developing renewable energy on the supply side, to enhance energy security and \naddress global warming and climate change. The Government has articulated a clear vision as \nreflected in its target of quadrupling the per capita GDP while only doubling energy use in 2000\u2013\n2020, requiring that energy elasticity be maintained at 0.3 over the next 12 years. In its medium- \nand  long-term  renewable  energy  development  program  promulgated  in  August  2007,  the \nGovernment set a goal to produce 15% of its primary energy from renewable sources by 2020, \nup from 7.5% in 2005. The share of renewable sources for electricity production will be raised to \n ", "20  Appendix 3 \n20% by 2020, including plans to develop 30 GW of wind power, 20 GW of biomass and biogas \npower, and 300 GW of hydropower capacity. \n \n6.  The legal and regulatory environment for renewable energy development in the PRC has \nsteadily improved in recent years. The value-added tax for wind power projects was reduced in \n2001 from 17% to 8.5%, which is very important for wind farm developers as no fuel costs are \nattached  to  wind  power  generation.  The  Government  is  considering  the  application  of  a \ncompulsory  quota  on  renewable  energy  generation  for  independent  power  producers.  No \nlicensing is required for importing wind power equipment. The Renewable Energy Law was \nformulated in February 2005 and put into effect in January 2006, stipulating financial incentives \nfor renewable energy projects such as a national fund to foster renewable energy development, \nimproved  access  to  financing,  and  specific  tax  preferences.  It  reduces  risks  for  project \ndevelopers by mandating power grid interconnection and full power offtaking, as well as by \nproviding guaranteed minimum prices or subsidies for certain types of renewable energy. \n \n7.  Wind  power  development  is  a  priority  area  in  the  national  Clean  Development \nMechanism  (CDM),  enabling  wind  farms  with  more  than  50%  domestic  ownership  to  sell \ncertified emission reduction certificates under the terms of the United Nations\u2019 Kyoto Protocol on \nClimate Change. By September 2008, 39 wind power projects in the PRC had successfully \nregistered with the CDM executive board. \n \nC.  Rapid Development of the PRC Wind Power Sector \n \n8.  The PRC has been developing its wind resources for over 2 decades but by 2000 \ninstalled only 345 MW of capacity, equivalent to a small coal-fired plant. Since the preparation \nand adoption of the Renewable Energy Law in 2005, the PRC has made rapid strides in \nharnessing wind resources, doubling its wind power generation capacity each year. In the \nmedium-  and  long-term  renewable  energy  development  program,  the  national  target  for \ncumulative wind power capacity was originally set at 5 GW by 2010 and 30 GW by 2020. The \ngoal for 2010 was achieved 3 years early, in 2007, and has therefore been lifted to 10 GW. \nReality is evolving so quickly that this revised goal of 10 GW is likely to be exceeded in 2008 \nand could be raised to a level surpassing 20 GW. \n \n9.  According to the Global Wind Energy Council, 3,155 wind turbines with a total capacity \nof 3.45 GW were installed in the PRC in 2007. This addition raised the PRC\u2019s cumulative wind \npower capacity to 6.1 MW in 158 wind farms across 21 provinces. Meanwhile, about 4.2 GW of \nwind power projects had been approved by the Government and were under construction in \n2007. Currently, Inner Mongolia leads the country by having erected 1,543 wind turbines by \n2007. It plans to install 8 GW by 2010, or 80% of the national goal, and 18 GW by 2015, or 60% \nof the national goal for 2020, with Huitengxile alone doubling its capacity to 1 GW by 2010. \nGansu has put forward proposals to develop by 2020 along the Hexi Corridor 20 GW of wind \npower, or 66% of the national goal. \n \n10.  The newly installed turbines in the PRC are much smaller than those in Europe and the \nUnited States, averaging 1.1 MW in 2007. According to the China Wind Industry Association, in \n2006, only 11% of operating wind turbines had rated capacities larger than 1.0 MW, and about \n79% of turbines still had rated capacities of 600 kilowatts (kW), 750 kW, or 850 kW. Many of \nthese small wind turbines occupy good sites with strong wind resources and may be targets for \nreplacement with larger and more efficient turbines in the near future.  \n \n11.  The PRC\u2019s total installed wind power capacity ranked fifth in the world in 2007 and may \nmove up one or two places by 2010. In fact, wind power is the fastest-growing renewable \nenergy source in the world, expanding by about 30% per annum. Global Wind Energy Council ", "Appendix 3  21\ndata indicates that more than 20 GW of wind turbines were installed worldwide in 2007, bringing \nglobal capacity to 94 GW, up by 27% from 2006. This nearly doubles the 2004 capacity of 48 \nGW and is more than five times the 2000 capacity of 18 GW. The top five countries in terms of \ninstalled capacity are Germany with 22 GW, United States with 17 GW, Spain with 15 GW, India \nwith 8 GW, and the PRC with 6 GW, jointly accounting for 72.6% of the world total. In terms of \neconomic value, the global wind market was worth $36 billion in 2007. In capacity addition, the \nUnited States took the lead in 2007, followed by the PRC and Spain.  \n \n12.  Despite its rapid development in recent years, wind power has achieved an insignificant \nshare in the PRC\u2019s overall power mix, occupying only 0.6% of the country's overall power \ngeneration capacity of 713.6 GW and a meager 0.2% in its total electricity output of 3,263.2 \nterrawatt-hours in 2007, according to the PRC Electricity Regulatory Commission. While wind \npower capacity addition accounted for 30% of total incremental power generation capacity in the \nUnited States in 2007, and 40% in Europe, wind power accounted for less than 3% of newly \ncommissioned capacity in the PRC in 2006 and 2007. Most new power generation facilities are \ngoing to burn coal of deteriorating quality and emit carbon dioxide for many decades to come.  \n \n13.  The current ratio between electricity output and the generation capacity of wind power in \nthe PRC indicates serious wind resource underutilization by existing wind farms. The average \ncapacity factor of wind farms was less than 20%, or 1,787 hours (h) of operation at full-load \nequivalent, in 2007, or less than the global average of 25%\u201330% (2,200\u20132,600 h). This partly \nreflected delays in commissioning power generation facilities and implementing transmission \nnetworks and power grid congestion, but also lack of wind farm management experience and \nequipment reliability issues.   \n \n14.  Rapid  capacity  expansion  and  the  70%  localization  requirement  of  the  National \nDevelopment and Reform Commission (NDRC) have stimulated the domestic wind equipment \nindustry, which is expanding quickly to meet high demand for wind turbines. More than 40 \ndomestic manufacturers, including joint ventures, now assemble wind turbines of various size. \nThey are gradually enlarging their combined share of the PRC turbine market, rising to 45% in \n2006 from less than 10% in 2000. Jinjiang Gold Wind, Inc., in Xinjiang has the biggest market \nshare, accounting for 33% of newly installed capacity in the PRC and 75% of domestic turbine \noutput. Foreign manufacturers shared the remaining 55% of the turbine market in 2006, among \nwhich Vestas of Denmark, Gamesa of Spain, and General Electric of the United States took the \nbiggest shares, jointly accounting for about half of newly installed capacity and over 90% of \nforeign turbine imports. \n \n15.  The PRC is the global leader in small wind turbines with capacity below 50 kW, which \nare used mostly for off-grid applications in remote areas. According to the World Wind Energy \nAssociation, the PRC operates 300,000 small wind turbines, accounting for 80% of the world's \ntotal. \n \nD.  Competitive Bidding for Concession Rights to Develop Wind Power Projects \n \n16.  NDRC promotes large-scale wind power development through a wind power concession \nprogram aiming to accelerate the pace of development and lower wind power generating costs \non one hand, and to increase the use of domestic wind power equipment on the other hand. \nNDRC allows authorities in provinces with abundant wind resources to invite international and \ndomestic investors to participate in competitive tendering. The major elements of a wind power \nconcession include the following: \n \n \n ", "22  Appendix 3 \n(i)  25-year concession duration. This is sufficient to cover the economic life of the \nwind farm. \n(ii)  Minimum capacity. Each project should have a capacity larger than 100 MW to \nachieve economies of scale. Wind farms under 100 MW can be approved by \nprovincial governments on a case by case basis. The unit capacity of wind \nturbines should be greater than 600 kW. \n(iii)  Local  components.  Seventy  percent  of  wind  turbine  components  must  be \nmanufactured domestically. \n(iv)  Supporting infrastructure. Local authorities are responsible for building main \naccess roads to wind farms.  \n(v)  Grid  connection.  The  power  grid  company  is  responsible  for  constructing \ntransmission lines to connect the wind farm substations and must sign a grid \nconnection agreement with the wind power generating companies. \n(vi)  Concession assignment. Project investors are selected by national open public \nbidding. Invitations to bid are announced in national newspapers and important \nbidding websites, and the results are similarly made public.  \n(vii)  Full uploading. All electricity produced by wind farms must be purchased by the \nprovincial power grid company, through a long-term power purchase agreement.  \n(viii)  Tariff determination. The wind power tariff is determined through competitive \ntendering. The winner's quoted tariff is authorized as the feed-in tariff of that wind \nfarm project. After the turbines have finished their first 30,000 h of operation at \nfull capacity equivalent, the feed-in tariff is adjusted to the grid average. \n \n17.  The concession contract and long-term power purchase agreement protect the interests \nof wind power investors and help minimize risks in recovering investment costs. The NDRC \napproved 15 large wind power projects with a total capacity of more than 2,600 MW under five \nrounds  of  concessions  held  annually  between  2003  and  2007.  Most  were  awarded  to \nsubsidiaries of the big five power generating companies. Once the tariff for wind power is \nestablished through a competitive bidding process, developers have the option to expand the \ncapacity of wind farms in the vicinity, provided that the tariff and other key conditions of the \nconcession remain the same. \n \nE.  Accelerating Wind Power Development in the PRC \n \n18.  Wind power development is expected to accelerate in the near future mainly because of \nthe improved regulatory framework, including the Renewable Energy Law and its implementing \npolicies; technological progress; rising coal and oil prices in the long run; more stringent control \nof environmental pollution; and the Government\u2019s stronger commitment to achieving greener \nand  low-carbon  economic  growth.  With  good  results  coming  during  the  11th  Five-Year \nDevelopment Plan period, the national goal for cumulative wind power capacity by 2020 can be \nraised to 120 GW, equivalent to the total capacity of seven Three Gorges hydropower facilities, \nor 120 coal-fired power plants of 1.0 GW each. This target would be considerably larger than \nthe International Energy Agency projection of 56 GW by 2020 but still account for less than 5% \nof the total technically exploitable wind energy resources in the PRC of 2,548 GW and will not \naffect the stability and reliability of the power grid. To achieve this target, 10 GW of wind power \nneeds to be installed annually for 10 years between 2011 and 2020. ", "Appendix 4  23\nTHE SPONSORS OF THE ZHANGBEI WIND POWER PROJECT \n \n1.  The  Zhangbei  Wind  Power  Project  (the  Project)  of  100.5  megawatts  (MW)  will  be \nimplemented by a special purpose vehicle organized as a Sino-foreign joint venture, which will \nbe indirectly 70% owned by China Energy Conservation Investment Corporation (CECIC) and \nindirectly 30% owned by HKC (Holdings) Limited, Inc. (HKC). Both sponsors have extensive \nindustry experience and strong financial capability for developing renewable energy projects in \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The proposed Project is the sixth wind power project \nundertaken by CECIC in Zhangbei, Hebei. It is also one of three wind power projects, with a \ncombined capacity of 500 MW, codeveloped by CECIC and HKC.1 CECIC and HKC also \ncollaborated to build a waste-to-energy cogeneration project in Linyi, Shandong Province. \n \nA.  China Energy Conservation and Investment Corporation \n \n2.  Headquartered in Beijing, CECIC is a large corporation owned by the Government of the \nPRC (the Government) and administered directly by the State-Owned Assets Supervision and \nAdministration Commission of the State Council. CECIC is the sole state-owned enterprise in \nthe  PRC  at  the  national  level  specifically  tasked  with  designing,  financing,  and  operating \nprojects for energy efficiency, renewable energy, and environmental protection. CECIC started \nin early 1980s, in response to the second international oil crisis, as the Energy Conservation \nPlanning Bureau in the former State Planning Commission, the forerunner of the National \nDevelopment and Reform Commission. It was empowered with the responsibility to allocate and \nmanage  state  energy  conservation  investment  funds.  In  1988,  the  PRC  State  Council \ncommercialized these functions and registered CECIC as a corporation with its own legal rights \nand financial responsibilities under the PRC Company Law.  \n \n1.  Business Operations and Development Strategy \n \n3.  To support the Government\u2019s increasingly strengthened commitment to efficiently utilize \nand conserve resources, including energy and water, and build an environmentally friendly \nsociety, CECIC has pioneered in introducing new technologies and developing demonstration \nprojects for energy efficiency and pollution control.  \n \n4.  During the past 20 years since its establishment, CECIC has completed more than 3,000 \nlarge and important energy conservation and renewable energy projects in 13 sectors in more \nthan 300 municipalities.2 The total accumulative investment exceeded CNY55.0 billion, serving \nboth fast-growing coastal provinces and resource-abundant western inland regions. Currently, \nCECIC treats and recycles more than 2 million tons (t) of industrial wastes and 260 million t of \nwastewater per year. These projects have delivered significant environmental benefits, including \n(i) annual energy savings amounting to 45.8 million t of standard coal; (ii) annual chemical \noxygen demand reductions amounting to 75,000 t; and (iii) annual reductions of carbon dioxide \n(CO ) emissions of 105.0 million t. CECIC has the goal to additionally save by 2012 through its \n2\n                                                 \n1  The other two wind power projects are (i) the 2006 national concession project of 200 MW with a total investment \nof CNY1.6 billion through a 60:40 joint venture at Danjinghe, Zhangbei, and (ii) the 2007 national concession \nproject of 200 MW at Changma, Gansu Province. \n2  These include 450 cogeneration projects with a combined capacity of 10,000 MW, more than 100 urban natural \ngas supply and distribution projects with a combined capacity of 13.93 million cubic meters per day, district heating \nprojects servicing more than 200 million square meters, coal cleansing and treatment capacity of 59.69 million t per \nyear, and wastewater treatment capacity of 110 million cubic meters per year for paper making and food \nprocessing industries. \n ", "24  Appendix 4 \nnew investment 4.3 million t of standard coal, reduce CO  emissions by 11.1 million t, cut \n2\n400,000 t of chemical oxygen demand, and process 5.0 million t of industrial wastes per year.  \n \n5.  CECIC  wholly  owns  or  holds  the  majority  shares  of  15  second-level  subsidiary \ncompanies and more than 60 third-level subsidiary companies. To grow further, CECIC plans to \nraise more equity capital through an initial public offering in a domestic or international stock \nexchange  in  about  3  years.  In  its  long-term  corporate  development  strategy,  CECIC \nconcentrates  80%  of  its  assets  in  four  key  areas:  (i)  wind  power  development;  (ii) waste \nmanagement; (iii) water supply, wastewater treatment, and sanitation; and (iv) energy efficiency \nimprovement and resource conservation. In recent years, CECIC has improved its corporate \ngovernance structure and formulated an action plan to fulfill its corporate social responsibilities.  \n \n6.  CECIC\u2019s investment in wind power development is channeled through its wholly owned \nsubsidiary specialized  in  wind  energy  investment,  the  CECIC  Wind Power  Investment  Co. \n(CECIC-WPI), which was established in January 2006 and now has total assets valued at \nCNY4.5 billion. For specific projects in different locations, project companies are set up to work \nwith various equity partners and debt financiers. \n \n7.  To  break  bottlenecks  on  wind  turbine  supply  and  absorb  advanced  wind  power \ntechnologies, CECIC acquired in June 2006 half of the second largest domestic wind turbine \nmanufacturer,  Zhejiang  Windey  Wind  Generating  Engineering  Co.,  Ltd.,  which  has  mature \ntechnologies for 800 kilowatt wind turbines and is now testing 1.5 MW turbines in cooperation \nwith a leading European turbine design company.  \n \n2.

The State Grid Corporation of China \n \n1.  Reform of the power sector of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) started in 2000 with \na strategic focus on separating power transmission and distribution from power generation to \nimprove market competition and operational efficiency. On 29 December 2002, the PRC State \nCouncil  established  the  State  Grid  Corporation  of  China  (SGCC)  to  inherit  most  power \ntransmission and distribution assets and business of the former State Power Company, which \nowned all thermal power generation facilities and transmission networks in the country.  Five \npower  generation  companies\u2014Datang,  Guodian,  Huadian,  Huaneng,  and  China  Power \nInvestment  Corporation\u2014were  established  to  manage  and  develop  the  thermal  power \ngeneration business. \n \n2.  As a backbone state-owned enterprise with clear mandates to ensure national energy \nsafety and to support economic lifelines, SGCC's core business is to build and operate power \ngrids  and  to  provide  sufficient,  secure,  and  reliable  electricity  supply  for  socioeconomic \ndevelopment. With a registered capital of CNY200 billion, SGCC has a service area covering 26 \nprovinces, or 88% of the national territory.1 SGCC is the owner and operator of the State Power \nGrid, which consists of five regional power grids (northeast, north, northwest, east, and central) \nand three independent provincial power grids (Shandong, Fujian, and Tibet). \n \n3.  SGCC is the world's largest public utility company, with 1.5 million workers (72% for \noperations; 22% for construction; 2% for design, research, and development; and 4% for other \nmanagement and logistic support). At the end of 2007, SGCC served 128 million customers and \na  total  population  over  1  billion, with  467,700  kilometers  (km)  of  transmission  line  at  110 \nkilovolts (kV) or above and 1,350.8 million kilovolt amperes of power transformation capacity at \n110 kV or above. Its total assets were CNY1,366 billion, with a debt\u2013asset ratio of 60.4%.  \n \n4.  In 2007, SGCC\u2019s electricity sales were 1,974.2 terawatt-hours (TWh), an increase by \n34.8% from that in 2005. Its revenue was CNY1,016 billion from main businesses (42.5% more \nthan in 2005), which ranked it 24th in the Fortune Global 500.

The North China Grid Company Limited \n6.  Headquartered in Beijing, the North China Grid Company, Ltd., (NCGC) was founded on \n8 November 2003 with sole ownership by SGCC, by combining the North China Power (Group) \nCorporation  and  the  Shandong  Power  (Group)  Corporation.  Its  registered  capital  stood  at \nCNY60 billion. Now NCGC consists of five provincial branch companies (Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, \nShanxi, and Shandong) and more than 30 other subsidiaries. \n \n7.  As the second largest among the five regional power grids under SGCC, NCGC bears \nresponsibility for safeguarding power supply to the PRC\u2019s capital, Beijing, and providing reliable \npower and services for economic and social development in the northern PRC. Its power grid \ncovers 1.63 million square kilometers and serves a population of 230 million. NCGC\u2019s power \ngrid has 48 transformation stations and 111 500-kV transmission lines totaling to 13,783 km. \nNCGC had total assets of CNY239 billion and net assets of CNY86 billion by the end of 2005.  \n \n8.  By the end of 2007, the total installed power generation capacity connected to the North \nChina  Power  Grid  (NCPG)  was  145  GW,  of  which  about  30%  was  in  the  Beijing-Tianjin-\nTangshan area.  This compares with the total installed power generation capacity in France of \n112.2 GW, Germany (118.9 GW), Italy (71.4 GW), Russian Federation (215.3 GW), Spain (61.0 \nGW), and United Kingdom (76.2 GW) in 2004.2  \n \n9.  Coal dominates power generation in the northern PRC, creating severe greenhouse gas \nemissions. About 97% of the power generation capacity covered by NCPG is coal fired, as the \nregion  has  scant  hydropower  resources.  To  diversify  electricity  supply  toward  renewable \nsources,  abundant  wind  energy  potential in Hebei  and Inner  Mongolia  must  be  effectively \nexploited, as pioneered by wind power development in Zhangbei. Demand for electricity in the \nnorthern PRC will continue to grow rapidly. According to the 11th Five-Year Development Plan \nfor the NCPG, both the load volume and electricity usage in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan area \nare estimated to double in the 15-year period from 2006 to 2020. \n  \n                                                 \n2  Energy Information Administration. 2007.

The financial evaluation of the Zhangbei Wind Power Project (the Project) uses 2008 as \nthe base year. The main assumptions for financial projections are built on the project sponsors' \nfinancial model, with adjustments to reflect findings from due diligence. The analysis was carried \nout over 25 years in line with the length of the concession period for the wind power project as \nawarded by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). \n \n2.  Business Model. Wind farm management is straightforward. All equipment is highly \nautomated and can be monitored and operated remotely. The modular structure of wind farms \nmeans that a few turbines can be kept idle for maintenance without significantly reducing \nelectricity output. No raw materials need to be procured, inventory handled, logistics or transport \narranged, products advertised or marketed, or emissions controlled. No post-sale services are \nrequired. The volume of electricity output and sales follow a seasonal pattern but cannot be \nprecisely scheduled. One hundred percent electricity output is sold to only one client, the North \nChina Power Grid (NCPG). Financial settlements with NCPG are normally completed within 45 \ndays, since the premium on tariff for wind power is shared by all end-users across the entire \npower grid.  \n \n3.  The Project's FIRR and DSCR were tested under various scenarios. Overall, the Project \nis  considered  to  be  bankable  under  different  scenarios,  sustaining  adequate  debt  service \ncoverage. \n ", "Appendix 7  31\nECONOMIC EVALUATION OF THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Background \n \n1.  The economic analysis of the Zhangbei Wind Power Project (the Project) was carried out \nin  line  with  a  standard  cost\u2013benefit  analysis  framework  and  in  accordance  with  Asian \nDevelopment Bank Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.1 All economic costs and \nbenefits are expressed in constant November 2008 domestic prices. The analysis was carried \nout over 25 years, in line with the length of the concession period for the Project as authorized \nby the National Development and Reform Commission. \n \n2.  Demand for power in the People's Republic of China (PRC) has risen rapidly in tandem \nwith economic growth. Total power generation capacity in the PRC exceeded 712 gigawatts in \n2007, dwarfing the installed capacity of 100.5 megawatts of wind power for the proposed \nProject.  \n \n3.  Economic Costs. Capital costs include physical contingencies but exclude taxes, price \ncontingencies, and financial charges during construction. Direct operational costs are paid to \nworkers, contractors, and service providers and are expected to increase in real terms by 2.5% \nannually. Project inputs are domestic and valued through shadow pricing using a standard \nconversion factor of 1.14. The Project is considered environmentally and socially benign and is \nunlikely to have external costs.  \n \n4.  Economic Benefits in Meeting Power Demand. Strong demand growth in the PRC \nmeans that all the electricity generated by the Project will meet unmet demand, rather than \nsubstitute for power from any existing generation capacity. Therefore, the entire project output \nis  considered  incremental,  amounting  to  250.9  gigawatt-hours  (GWh)  of  clean  electricity \nannually. The economic value of the incremental electricity generation is taken to be the \nweighted  average  willingness-to-pay  for  power  across  the  customer  classes,  which  was \nestimated at CNY0.76 per kilowatt-hour (kWh).2 \n \n5.  Economic Benefits in Reducing GHG Emissions. As the Project employs renewable \nenergy technologies, its production of electricity without greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will \ngenerate global benefits in terms of avoided climate change. The Project is expected to reduce \nGHG emissions by 242,127 tons (t) of carbon dioxide (CO ) equivalent per annum relative to a \n2\ncoal-fired plant baseline. The global environmental benefit of the Project is estimated using \ncertified emission reductions (CERs) as a proxy. The value of CERs is assumed to be $15 per \nton of CO  before 2012 and $6 thereafter. However, the literature on climate change suggests \n2\nthat avoided global damage from reducing CO  emissions, or the social value of carbon, is \n2\nlikely to be significantly larger than the carbon market value.3 The Project\u2019s economic internal \nrate of return (EIRR) improves dramatically when the social value of carbon is included on the \nbenefit side. \n \n6.  Economic Benefits in Pollution Control and Resource Conservation. The Project \nwill reduce other emissions, such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matters, \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1997.

(TA 4309-PRC, approved on 31 May 2006, for $600,000). The estimate in the paper is \nCNY0.68 per kWh. This figure was adjusted to the 2008 price using inflation rates of 4.77% in 2007 and 6.43% in \n2008. \n3  Social value of carbon is estimated as the present value of the total damages inflicted or reduced globally when an \nadditional unit of CO  is emitted into or taken out of the atmosphere. \n2\n ", "32  Appendix 7 \nwhich are generated by thermal power production. The Project will conserve scarce resources, \nmainly coal and freshwater. However, in the absence of a market for emission reductions and \nresource conservation, these benefits are not quantifiable and are therefore not captured in the \neconomic analysis. The EIRR of the Project would be even higher when these benefits were \nincluded. \n \nB.  Tax Contributions \n7.  Taxation. The Government has given fiscal incentives to develop renewable energy in \nunderdeveloped  areas  such  as  Zhangbei,  halving  the  value-added  tax  (VAT)  to  8.5%. \nCorporate income tax is exempted for the first 3 years of operations and, thereafter, is levied at \n25.0%. Two surcharges for education and urban construction are based on the VAT at 5% and \n4%, respectively. After the 3-year tax holiday, the corporate income tax increases together with \nthe gross profit. It accelerates at the points when interest payments on long-term debt are \nphased out and again when the fixed assets are completely depreciated. The VAT and the \nsurcharges sum to slightly more than CNY10 million per year. Total taxes amount to CNY554.6 \nmillion over the project life, contributing substantial fiscal revenue to support local development \nand solidifying support for the Project from the central and local governments. \n \nC.  Least-Cost Analysis \n8.  Coal-fired thermal power plants currently dominate electricity generation in the northern \nPRC. About 97% of the power generation capacity in Hebei Province is coal-fired, as scant \nhydropower resources exist there. Hence, a coal-fired power plant is set as a baseline project \nfor least-cost analysis. The investment cost for a traditional coal-fired power plant in the PRC is \nrelatively low at $600/kilowatt, or less than half of that of the Project, which is $1,364/kilowatt. \nHowever, a coal-fired power plant needs to purchase and combust coal continuously and emits \na significant amount of CO . \n2\n \n9.  The analysis considers a subcritical coal-fired power plant, which has a CO  intensity \n2\nlevel of 1,100 t of CO  emissions per GWh of electricity generated. Taking account of the social \n2\ndamage from CO  emissions, the average incremental cost of the coal power unit is estimated \n2\nto be $0.60/KWh of electricity generated. On the other hand, the average incremental cost of \nthe Project is only $0.49/KWh. A coal-fired power plant also emits local pollutants such as \nsulfur dioxide and particulates that have adverse impacts on health. The estimate of average \nincremental cost for the coal-fired power plant will be even higher when these social costs are \nincluded. The analysis shows that the Project has the least economic and social cost. \n \nD.  Economic Internal Rate of Return \n \n10.  The EIRR of the Project is conservatively estimated to be 17.4%, which is above the \nbenchmark social discount rate of 12%. When the benefits from avoided GHG emissions is \nadded the EIRR increases to 33.6%.  \n ", "Appendix 7  33\nTable A7.1: Estimates of Economic Costs and Benefits \n(CNY million) \n \nYear  Total  Capital  Operation and  Total  Electricity  CDM  Net \n  Economic  Cost  Maintenance  Economic  Sales  Benefit  Economic \n  Cost    Cost  Benefit      Benefit \n2008  (447.2)  (447.2)  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  (447.2) \n2009  (562.4)  (559.9)     (2.5)  0.0      0.0      0.0     (562.4) \n2010      (4.8)       (4.8)   210.4    190.7      19.8   205.6  \n2011      (6.2)       (6.2)   210.4    190.7      19.8   204.3  \n2012    (21.2)     (21.2)   210.4    190.7      19.8   189.2  \n2013    (21.6)     (21.6)   210.4    190.7      19.8   188.9  \n2014    (21.9)     (21.9)   210.4    190.7      19.8   188.5  \n2015    (22.3)     (22.3)   210.4    190.7      19.8    188.1  \n2016    (22.7)     (22.7)   210.4    190.7      19.8    187.7  \n2017    (23.1)     (23.1)   210.4    190.7      19.8    187.3  \n2018    (23.6)     (23.6)   210.4    190.7      19.8    186.9  \n2019    (24.0)     (24.0)   210.4    190.7      19.8    186.4  \n2020    (24.5)     (24.5)   210.4    190.7      19.8    186.0  \n2021    (24.9)     (24.9)   210.4    190.7      19.8    185.5  \n2022    (25.4)     (25.4)   210.4    190.7      19.8    185.0  \n2023    (25.9)     (25.9)   210.4    190.7      19.8    184.6  \n2024    (26.4)     (26.4)   210.4    190.7      19.8    184.0  \n2025    (26.9)     (26.9)   210.4    190.7      19.8    183.5  \n2026    (27.5)     (27.5)   210.4    190.7      19.8    183.0  \n2027    (28.0)     (28.0)   210.4    190.7      19.8    182.4  \n2028    (28.6)     (28.6)   210.4    190.7      19.8    181.8  \n2029    (29.2)     (29.2)   210.4    190.7      19.8    181.2  \n2030    (29.8)     (29.8)   210.4    190.7      19.8    180.6  \n2031    (30.6)     (30.6)   210.4    190.7      19.8    179.9  \n2032    (77.9)     (77.9)   210.4    190.7      19.8    132.5  \n            EIRR =  17.4% \n( ) = negative, CDM = clean development mechanism, EIRR = economic internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.

Introduction \n \n1.  The  China  Energy  Conservation  Investment  Corporation  (CECIC)  won  through  a \nnational  competitive  bidding  process  organized  by  the  National  Development  and  Reform \nCommission (NDRC) the concession rights for 25 years to develop a wind power project of \n100.5  megawatts  (MW)  on  a  build-operate-own  basis  at  L\u00fcnaobao  in  Zhangbei  County, \nZhangjiakou Municipality, Hebei Province.  \n \n2.  The  Zhangbei  Wind  Power  Project  (the  Project)  will  be  implemented  by  a  special \npurpose vehicle in the form of a Sino\u2013foreign joint venture indirectly 70% owned by CECIC and \nindirectly 30% owned by the HKC (Holdings), Ltd., (HKC). The total project cost is estimated to \nbe CNY932.0 million, 34% of which will be financed by equity from two sponsors and 66% by \nlong-term debts provided through a proposed Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan. Special \nfunds have been allocated for environmental protection and conservation of water and soil in the \nproject area. \n \n3.  The Project will install 67 wind turbine generators (WTGs), each with a rated output of \n1.5 MW, on ridges ascending from northwest to southeast, perpendicular to the prevailing wind \ndirection from the north. The Project is the sixth wind power project developed by CECIC in \nZhangbei and planned to be fully commissioned by early 2010. The Project\u2019s capacity factor is \nprojected to be 28.5%, providing 2,497 hours (h) of operation at full-capacity equivalent and \nsupplying 250.9 gigawatt-hours of clean electricity from renewable wind resources per annum to \nmitigate chronic shortage on the North China Power Grid (NCPG).  \n \n4.  Coal-fired thermal power plants currently dominate electricity generation in the northern \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), accelerating resource depletion, exacerbating environmental \ndeterioration,  and  causing  ever-rising  costs  of  electricity  for  industrial,  commercial,  and \nresidential uses. The Project's main objective is to utilize abundant local wind resources more \neffectively to replace 86,118 tons (t) of standard coal per year and to abate greenhouse gas \n(GHG) emissions by avoiding more than 5.5 million ton of carbon dioxide emissions during the \n25-year concession.

More than 1,600 units of this \ntype  of  WTG  have  been  installed  worldwide.  Under  the  equipment  supply  contract,  the \nmanufacturer provides a 24-month warranty, which guarantees a per unit WTG yield curve of no \nless than 95% of the guaranteed value and an average WTG availability of no less than 95% of ", "Appendix 8  37\nthe applicable availability percentage for all units of the wind farm collectively. The power \ngenerated will be evacuated from the substation connected to the NCPG through a 220 kilovolt \nline. According to the renewable energy law, the NCPG is responsible for building transmission \nlines to connect the wind farm to the existing power grid and to purchase 100% of the electricity \ngenerated by the Project. \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n10.  Project  Location. Abutting on the southern rim of the Inner Mongolia Plateau, the \nproject site is centered at 114o32\u201930\u201d east longitude and 41o03\u201950\u201d north latitude. The project \nsite altitude ranges from 1,500 meters (m) to 1,600 m above the mean sea level. It is 17 \nkilometers (km) from Zhangbei County Town and 242 km northwest from Beijing, making it \nclose to the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan load centers. The project site is 21 km from the national \nhighway connecting Beijing to Hohhot, the capital of the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region.  \n \n11.  The project area has a semi-arid, intermediate temperate continental monsoon climate, \nfeaturing a long and cold winter, dry and windy spring, and short and hot summer. The project \nsite  and  its  environs  are  the  driest  and  coldest  area  in  Hebei.  Its  annual  rainfall  is  300 \nmillimeters, and its annual average air temperature is 2.6 degrees Celsius. \n \n12.  Zhangbei has some of the richest wind resources in the northern PRC, as it is on the \nregular route for frequent southbound cold highs from Siberia and the Mongolian Plateau, which \nrapidly sweep toward the North China Plain with strong winds. Total commercially exploitable \nwind power resources in Zhangbei are estimated to be around 5,000 MW. NDRC selected \nZhangbei  as  the  PRC\u2019s  first  1,000  MW  wind  power  development  district.  More  than  10 \ncompanies are currently developing or operating wind farms in or near Zhangbei. CECIC has \ndeveloped five winds farms nearby, including one at Danjinghe as a joint venture with HKC. \n \n13.  The project site is favorable for wind power development. The average annual wind \nvelocity at 70 m above ground is 8.42 m per second (m/s) and the annual wind energy density \nat 70 m is 492.3 watts per square meter. The frequencies for the five wind directions (west-\nnorthwest, northwest, north-northwest, southeast, and south-southeast) sum to 71.5%, and the \nprobability for the wind velocity ranging between 3 m/s and 25 m/s stands at 99.96%. The \nestimated maximum wind velocity averaged over a 10-minute interval occurring once every 50 \nyears is 41.1 m/s.  \n \n14.  Physical Environment. The project site is mostly uninhabited and degraded grassland, \nwith many rock outcrops and gravel areas with scarce vegetation. The soil is arid, mainly sand \nand silt with little agricultural value. The project area has certain natural water sources, including \nboth surface and groundwater, but does not enclose any identified archeological, historical, \ncultural, or religious sites or commercial deposits of mineral resources. The air and water quality \nis typically average for the region. The background noise comes mainly from wind. \n \n15.  Biological  Environment.  Because  of  the  dry  climate,  the  project  site  and  its \nsurrounding areas have no large trees apart from those planted in villages. There are no wildlife \nsanctuaries, reserve forests, bird sanctuaries, and rare or endangered species of animals or \nplants in the vicinity. There are no specific migration paths of birds near the project area.  \n \n16.  Socioeconomic  Environment.  Human  settlements  are  found  only  in  areas  below \nwhere the wind farm is located. With an area of 4,185 square kilometers (km\u00b2), Zhangbei had a \n ", "38  Appendix 8 \npopulation of 370,800 in 2007, 83% of which depend on agriculture and animal husbandry1 and \nare thus vulnerable to the harsh climate. In 2006, the county\u2019s GDP stood at CNY2.5 billion, and \nthe net income per farmer was merely CNY2,773 ($347), which is less than $1 per day and \namong of the lowest in the PRC. \n \nD.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement  \n \n17.  Land Acquisition. The land to be affected by the Project will total 0.71 km2, of which \n0.39 km2 (54%) will be permanently occupied and 0.32 km2 (46%) temporarily used. Most lands \nare on currently unproductive ridges and have been acquired through negotiations with the \nvillagers as willing sellers.  \n \n18.  Indigenous Peoples and Resettlement. No indigenous people live close to or within \nthe sites identified for the wind farm. As the sites are vacant, there is no need for resettlement \narrangements.  Therefore,  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  Policy  on \nIndigenous Peoples (1998) are not triggered. \n \nE.  Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n19.  Environmental protection standards in the PRC have been strengthened in recent years. \nThe construction and operation of wind farms must strictly follow a series of national standards, \nincluding the following: \n(i)  Ambient Air Quality Standards (GB3095-1996) Grade II; \n(ii)  Surface Water Quality Standards (GB3838-2002) Grade III;  \n(iii)  Standard of Environmental Noise in the Urban Area (GB3096-1993) Grade I; \n(iv)  Ecology Quality Standards; \n(v)  Air Pollutant Discharge Standards (GB16297-1996) Grade II; \n(vi)  Sewage Discharge Standards (GB8978-1996) Grade I; \n(vii)  Construction Site Noise Limits (GB12523-1990) Grade III; and \n(viii)  Industrial Sector Noise Standards (GB12348-1990) Grade II. \n \n1.  Impacts and Mitigation Measures during Construction \n \n20.  Project construction entails only minor civil, mechanical, and electrical works over a \nrelatively  short  period  on  several  small  areas  scattered  over  a  wide  area.  Construction, \nparticularly the construction of a 1.8 km road from the main road to the wind farm, will create \nsome small and transient environmental disturbances such as noise, exhaust emissions, and \nflying  dust  from  moving  trucks  and  heavy  equipment.  No  groundwater  will  be  tapped  for \nconstruction work. The effect on vegetation, animals, water and soil loss, and the atmosphere \nare scant. Earth excavated during road construction will be used for road embankments and \nminor leveling of the site during site restoration after construction. The wastes from about 150 \nworkers, estimated to be 37.5 kilograms per day, will be collected and transported to the county \ngarbage treatment site. \n \n21.  The 67 WTGs will be erected sequentially using only two to four cranes. Construction \nand installation equipment will be removed upon completion, and the ground will be cleaned so \nthat the land can be reused. Vegetation cover spoiled during temporary land uses will be \nregenerated within 3 years. The nearest residence is at least 500 m away from the project site, \nand noise from the operation of heavy equipment will be below 50 decibels (dB). \n                                                 \n1  The rural population is distributed in 18 towns, 366 administrative villages, and 1,167 natural villages. ", "Appendix 8  39\n22.  Construction will generate direct and indirect temporary employment for both casual and \nskilled labor. Health and safety measures will be implemented, including AIDS prevention. The \nexisting culture and health of the local populations will not be affected as the construction period \nwill be very short. \n \n2.  Impacts and Mitigation Measures during Operation \n23.  The  operation  and  maintenance2 of  wind  farms  does  not  involve  any  atmospheric \nemissions  or  effluent  discharges.  Fluids  and  other  waste  materials  associated  with  typical \nmaintenance will not be stored on site and will be disposed of off site in approved landfills.  \n \n24.  The main environmental impacts of the Project during operation and the corresponding \nmitigation measures are as follows: \n(i)  Land  use.  The  land  occupied  by  the  wind  farm  is  not  arable,  and  the \npermanently occupied land is very small and properly purchased.  \n(ii)  Bird fatalities. The WTGs will not endanger migratory birds or bats as there are \nfew in the wind farm area, which is not located in the main habitat or along the \nmain migration routes of migratory birds. According to the project EIA, the death \nrate of birds and bats will not rise because of the Project.  \n(iii)  Noise. The operating noise of 1.5 MW WTGs ranges from 90 to 102 dB, and \ndrops quickly to 45 dB at a distance of 500 m. As the nearest residences are at \nleast 500 m away from the wind farm, they will not be affected by the noise. \n(iv)  Air pollution. The WTGs do not generate any air pollution emissions. \n(v)  Visual intrusion. WTG towers erected far from inhabited areas will not create \nadverse visual impacts, as the ridge on which the wind farm is located is not \nknown for its natural beauty. The turbine design minimizes the flickering effects \nof blade rotation. Villagers plan to develop ecotourism using the wind farms to \nattract tourists interested in clean energy development. \n(vi)  Air traffic safety. The Project will strictly adhere to regulations regarding air \ntraffic  safety  relevant  to  tall  WTG  towers.  In  line  with  regulations  for  air \nnavigational markings, the upper section of the towers and turbine blades will be \nmarked with bands of a specified width to enhance their visibility. Blinking lights \nwill  provide  clear  identification  at  night.  No  impact  on  air  traffic  safety  is \nanticipated. \n(vii)  Soil erosion. Transformers at each WTG tower and the substation have been \ndesigned, and will be properly maintained, to avoid soil erosion. \n(viii)  Magnetic radiation. Magnetic radiation from a wind farm is low, and the health \nof residents and local electrical equipment will not be affected. \n(ix)  Waste management. The 24 cubic meters of wastewater and 12.5 kilograms of \ntrash generated per day during operation are minimal. The wastewater will be \ntreated on site for recycling, and the garbage will be collected and disposed of at \nthe county\u2019s garbage collection station, with little impact on the environment.  \n \n25.  The project area has experienced seismic tremors ranging from 2.0 to 6.2 on the Richter \nscale. The WTGs, towers, and buildings have therefore been designed, and will be constructed, \nto be able to withstand lateral ground movements caused by seismic shocks. Insurance policies \nare required to cover possible losses from natural disasters. \n                                                 \n2  Routine maintenance will be conducted throughout the lifetime of the wind turbines, generally amounting to \n80 hours a year and mainly being the maintenance of the turbine, rotor, and electrical components; lubrication of \nparts; and full generator overhaul. \n ", "40  Appendix 8 \nF.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Management Plan \n \n26.  Organizational Structure, Roles, and Responsibilities. As the project company is \nresponsible for constructing, operating, and maintaining the WTGs and the facilitating system, it \nwill be accountable for environmental management and monitoring. The project company will \nensure that it and all subcontractors comply with all regulations and conditions for various \nconstruction and operation activities. The Hebei Provincial Environment Protection Bureau will \nvalidate at the end of project construction that all environmental issues have been properly \nhandled and will issue a formal certificate if the handling fully meets national requirements. \nWithout such a certificate the wind farm cannot be commissioned. During the operation period, \nthe  Zhangbei  County  Environment  Protection  Bureau  is  required  by  the  Hebei  Provincial \nEnvironment Protection Bureau to conduct periodic examinations on the environmental issues \nrelated to the Project. \n \n27.  Environmental  Management  Plan.  A  social  and  environmental  management  plan \n(SEMP) has been formulated to articulate potential impacts, corresponding mitigating measures, \nand the implementation timeframe, with carefully designed monitoring arrangements. Carrying \nout  the  SEMP  will  minimize  environmental  and  social  disturbances  associated  with  the \nconstruction, operation, and maintenance of the Project. The general manager of the project \ncompany, assisted by the heads of operations and administration departments, will bear the \nresponsibility for satisfactory implementation of the SEMP. The SEMP and the environmental \nmonitoring program are presented in Tables A8.3 and A8.4. \n \nG.  Public Consultation and Disclosure \n \n28.  CECIC has conducted many activities to raise awareness on wind energy development \nin the project vicinity. Local communities have demonstrated good understanding of the nature \nand scope of wind energy projects. Formal public consultation sessions were held during project \ndue  diligence  in  November  2008  and  were  attended  by  relevant  stakeholders,  including \nrepresentatives of local residents and governments, to solicit their views on the Project and its \nenvironmental and social aspects. The outcome of these consultations has verified that the \nProject  has  no  significant  negative  environmental  and  social  impacts.  In  fact,  the  local \ncommunities  welcome  wind  power  projects  with  expectations  for  emerging  economic \nopportunities and additional tax revenues to support social welfare programs that directly benefit \nlocal low-income groups. Furthermore, CECIC will exercise its social corporate responsibilities \nto provide assistance for community development. \n \nH.  Conclusions \n29.  Sufficient data and analyses exist to conclude that the Project, generating renewable \nenergy from wind resources on marginal land with insignificant economic and ecological value, \ncontributes to reducing GHG emissions and delivers long-term economic, environmental, and \nsocial benefits. Disturbances during construction will be small and transient and can be properly \nmanaged. The perceptible environmental impacts during operation are mostly noise and visual \nintrusion, but both are considered to be minimal given the WTGs\u2019 distance to the nearest \nsettlements and the limited landscape value of the project site. If the project company properly \nimplements  the  SEMP,  the  Project  is  unlikely  to  cause  any  significant  or  lasting  negative \nenvironmental or social impacts. Existing information is adequate to justify environmental and \nsocial clearance of the Project without requiring further environmental or social assessments. \n ", "Appendix 8  41\nTable A8.3: Social and Environmental Management Plan \n \nEnvironmental \nIssues  Mitigation Measures  Time Frame \nLand use   Restricting construction-related activities within the project  During site \narea.  clearance and \nconstruction \nMinimizing temporary land uses through sequentially \nerecting wind turbines by sections. \nCarrying out daily site inspection to ensure removal of \nconstruction materials, debris, or surplus earth materials. \nEcological  Restricting vegetation removal within the wind farm area  Before start of \nissues  and for road alignment.  construction \nCompensatory plantation using local plant species.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nEnergy conservation and environmental protection are two major challenges for sustainable development in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The proposed Zhangbei Wind Power Project (the Project) extends continued \nsupport of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to implementing the PRC\u2019s 11th Five-Year Development Plan (2006\u2013\n2010), which attaches top priority to improving energy efficiency, developing renewable energy, and controlling \npollution emissions, and specifically requires that financial assistance from international financial institutions be used \nfor resource conservation, environmental improvement, and infrastructure development. The Project supports the \nPRC\u2019s  Country  Program  on  Climate  Change  toward  cutting  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  replacing  coal \nconsumption and diversifying electricity supply into renewable sources.  \n \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC concentrates on achieving balanced and sustainable growth with the \nmore efficient use of resources and more stringent environmental protection. The proposed Project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s overarching aims for inclusive, efficient, equitable, and sustainable economic growth to eliminate poverty. In \nits long-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020), ADB identified energy as one of five core operational \nareas and achieving environmental sustainability as one of three strategic development priorities.a ADB\u2019s operational \nfocus for the energy sector is to address energy security and climate change by improving energy efficiency and \nenlarging the use of indigenous, clean, and renewable energy. In recent years, ADB has introduced new initiatives \nand adopted new and more client-oriented operational modalities (e.g., nonsovereign operations) to reinforce its \nassistance to its developing member countries as they acquire low-carbon technologies and implement projects \npromoting energy efficiency and renewable energy development. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                        Targeting Classification:  General Intervention  \n1.  Key Issues  \nThe Project is located in Zhangbei, Hebei, one of the PRC\u2019s nationally recognized poverty counties, with infertile soil \nand a harsh climate. Generating electricity by burning coal damages local air quality and the natural environment. \nThe Project will improve local and regional air quality and reduce acid rain by replacing 86,118 tons (t) of standard \ncoal for power generation and thus cut emissions by 1,984 t of sulfur dioxide, 1,126 t of nitrogen dioxide, and \n \n242,127 t of carbon dioxideper year. It will also contribute to conserving the local natural environment by annually \n \nsaving 5,900 t of freshwater and eliminating 21,530 t of coal ash residues, which cause soil deterioration.  \n \nAgriculture is the main economic activity of most of the population in the project county. Tax revenues from local \nindustries are very limited. The county government needs to widen and strengthen sources of revenues to provide \nbasic social services to residents.  \n \n2.   Design Features \nThe proposed Project will increase the electricity supply from clean and renewable sources to mitigate chronic power \nshortages and to booster the development of local manufacturing and service industries; encourage the participation \nof private sector and foreign investors in renewable energy development; create job opportunities and income growth \nduring construction and operation; enlarge revenues to enhance welfare programs; upgrade physical infrastructure \n(e.g., roads, power transmission networks, and telecommunication facilities); and improve the regional ecological \nenvironment. The Project will generate demonstration effects for wind power projects in the PRC by deploying \nadvanced  wind  power  technologies  and  adopting  international  practices  on  corporate  governance  and  risk \nmanagement. The  low-income  group  in  the  project  area  will  directly  benefit  from  the  social,  economic,  and \nenvironmental impacts of the proposed Project. \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \nThe project county, Zhangbei, is situated in the northern part of Hebei Province, bordering the Inner Mongolia \nAutonomous Region to the north, with a land area of 4,185 square kilometers and a population of 375,000 in 2007. \nThe gross domestic product of Zhangbei was CNY1.7 billion in 2005, of which primary industries (including wheat, \nbeans, potato, and livestock) contributed CNY900 million, or 53%; secondary industries (including leather and meat \nproducts and construction materials) contributed CNY350 million, or 21%; and tertiary industries (mainly tourism) \n ", "46  Appendix 9 \ncontributed CNY450 million, or 26%. The annual revenue in 2005 was CNY446 million, of which only CNY40 million \nwas generated by local businesses. It is estimated that the project will generate CNY13.3 million in revenues during \na normal operation year through value-added taxes, corporate income taxes, and other surcharges.  \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nStakeholders have been consulted to identify the environmental and social costs and benefits of the project. \nMitigation action plans have been adopted through a participatory process to minimize environmental damage during \nconstruction and operation. The project company has adopted a corporate social responsibility mechanism to assist \nsocioeconomic development and environmental enhancement in the project area. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring? \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.
