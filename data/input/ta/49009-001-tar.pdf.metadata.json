INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  During the August 2014 country programming mission, the Government of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide technical \nassistance (TA) to sustain promotion of partnerships for South\u2013South cooperation.1 The TA will \nenable  continuation  of  South\u2013South  knowledge  cooperation  between  the  PRC  and  other \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs).2 The TA is included in the PRC\u2019s country operations \nbusiness  plan,  2015\u20132017  as  firm  TA  for  the  2015  pipeline.3 During  the  TA  consultation \nmeetings held with the government in April and September 2015, understanding was reached \non the project\u2019s impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost and financing \narrangements, and terms of reference. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Since  the  reforms  initiated  in  the  1980s,  the  PRC  has  experienced  unprecedented \neconomic growth. As a result, the PRC\u2019s gross domestic product grew from 3.4% of global \ngross domestic product in 2000 to 13.0% in 2014.5 It is the world\u2019s second-largest economy and \nimporter. Rapid growth has been accompanied by a number of structural problems, including \neconomic imbalances, rising inequality, resource constraints, and environmental degradation. \nThe PRC\u2019s diverse and rich development experiences and lessons in promoting rapid economic \ngrowth and dealing with the development challenges are valuable for other developing countries. \nThe PRC can also learn from the development lessons of other countries and build on their \nsuccess. Increasing awareness of emerging development issues and challenges and sharing \ngood  practices  among  the  PRC  and  other  DMCs  in  the  region  is  essential  for  regional \ncooperation and development.  \n \n3.  Knowledge and innovation has been a core theme in ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy \nfor the PRC since 2008.6 In the PRC country partnership strategy for 2011\u20132015, knowledge \ncooperation underpins the long-term PRC\u2013ADB partnership. Knowledge solutions is one driver \nof  change,  with  knowledge  sharing  to  be more  actively  promoted  in all  priority  sectors  to \npromote  best  practices  and  scaling  up  of  demonstration  projects.  The  findings  of  the \nIndependent  Evaluation  Department  mission 7 on  country  assistance  program  evaluation \nindicated that nearly all TA projects completed during 2006\u20132014 have been rated successful or \nhighly successful. ADB has made significant policy contributions, provided a wide range of \nknowledge products and services, and played an important role in fostering regional cooperation \namong the PRC and neighboring countries. ADB has been supporting South\u2013South knowledge \nsharing through (i) the Regional Knowledge Sharing Initiative (RKSI) to promote knowledge \n                                                \n1   South\u2013South  cooperation  is  economic  cooperation  among  developing  countries  aimed  at  closer  policy \ncoordination and collaboration in support of regional and global public goods, accelerating economic growth, and \nreducing economic disparities. \n2   ADB. 2011.

Manila. \n7   The Independent Evaluation Department conducted a country assistance program evaluation mission to the PRC \non 3\u201321 November 2014 for the country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for the PRC.  \n \n ", "2   \nexchange, dissemination, and coordination; (ii) the ADB\u2013PRC Knowledge Sharing Platform \n(KSP) to share knowledge, facilitate dialogue, and strengthen partnerships and networks among \nthe PRC and other DMCs; and (iii)  working with sector-focused knowledge hubs to share \nknowledge in a particular sector.  \n \n4.   The KSP was established by the PRC Ministry of Finance and ADB in 2009 to promote \nSouth\u2013South cooperation as a vehicle to share solutions for key emerging development issues \nand challenges faced by developing countries in Asia and the Pacific; contribute to sound \ndevelopment management and policy making; and promote regionally inclusive development. \nADB acts as a facilitator to promote evidence-based exchange and learning between the PRC \nand other DMCs and contributes to conceptualizing, designing, and financing KSP activities. As \na result of its rich knowledge and experience generated in knowledge-based and innovation-\ndriven investment projects and TA in the PRC, ADB plays the unique role of a knowledge broker \nrelative to other existing players and knowledge tools available to the PRC. When combined \nwith  ADB\u2019s  strength  in knowledge management,  dissemination,  and  sharing, this  makes  it \npossible to effectively share the PRC\u2019s wide and deep development experience with other \nDMCs. The KSP starts with identifying host country issues and matching relevant knowledge \nthrough  joint  ADB\u2013PRC  consultation,  and  culminates  in  South\u2013South  knowledge-sharing \nactivities.   \n \n5.  The RKSI serves as an overall framework for knowledge sharing involving the PRC and \nDMCs by synchronizing different resources under its framework of cooperation. The KSP is one \nplatform under the RKSI, and it focuses on a priority development issue at its annual event to \npromote  evidence-based  learning  between  the  PRC  and  other  DMCs.  Under  the  RKSI \nframework, successful cases and lessons are disseminated in cooperation with the knowledge \nmanagement  units  of  ADB,  resident  missions,  and  knowledge  hubs.  Knowledge  hubs,  in \nparticular, are effective means of facilitating knowledge generation and sharing through their \nsector-focused networks of researchers and institutions. The KSP is an important link in South\u2013\nSouth knowledge sharing. Since 2009, six KSP events have been organized:  \n(i)  The  High-Level  Regional  Knowledge  Sharing  Workshop  on  Sustainable \nUrbanization was held in Shanghai on 2\u20136 November 2009. It was attended by \n50 senior officials from 11 DMCs and discussions focused on sound urbanization \nstrategies, good  practices  and  common  challenges  in  urban  planning,  urban \nrenewal and expansion, and urban finance. \n(ii)  The  High-Level  Regional  Knowledge  Sharing  Workshop  on  Transport \nInfrastructure: An Instrument for Economic and Social Development was held in \nBeijing on 8\u201311 November 2010. It was attended by 70 officials from 15 DMCs \nand  discussions  focused  on  the  role  of  transport  infrastructure  in  promoting \neconomic and social development, strategies for road network development and \nplanning of road infrastructure, financing transport infrastructure, and institutional \ncapacity building.  \n(iii)  The High-Level Regional Knowledge Sharing Workshop on Agriculture and Rural \nDevelopment was held in Beijing on 7\u201310 November 2011. It was attended by 70 \nofficials  from  15  DMCs  and  discussions  focused  on  best  practices  in  farm \nproductivity  to  boost  farmers\u2019  incomes,  agriculture  research,  green  rural \ninfrastructure, and rural financial development. \n(iv)  The High-Level Regional Knowledge Sharing Forum on South\u2013South Knowledge \nCooperation  was  held  on  13  September  2012  in  Manila,  with  about  80 \nparticipants from 15 DMCs. Former ADB President Kuroda cited the ADB\u2013PRC \njointly  managed  KSP,  which  enables  sharing  of  solutions  for  key  emerging \ndevelopment issues and challenges faced by the region's developing countries, \n ", "  3 \ncontributes  to  sound  development  management  and  policy  making,  and \npromotes regionally inclusive development.  \n(v)  The  High-Level  Regional  Knowledge  Sharing  Workshop  on  Sustainable \nVocational Training Toward Industrial Upgrading and Economic Transformation \nwas held in Beijing on 2\u20133 December 2013. More than 90 participants from 16 \ncountries  participated  to  discuss  best  practice  and  models  for  supporting \nsustainable  vocational  training;  the  role  of  government,  the  private  sector, \nenterprises,  and  vocational  training  schools;  and  financing  and  the  policy \nenvironment  for  vocational  training.  The  participants  also  visited  Guangdong \nprovince to learn about best practice in the PRC. \n(vi)  The  High-Level  Regional  Knowledge  Sharing  Workshop  Deepening  Public\u2013\nPrivate Partnerships (PPPs) was held in Beijing on 25\u201328 November 2014. More \nthan 110 participants from 18 countries attended the workshop, which provided \nan opportunity to take stock of approaches to PPPs in Asia and the Pacific, and \nto set out new approaches that learn from the experience in the region and \nelsewhere. The workshop explored new developments in PPPs, ingredients for a \nsuccessful  enabling  environment  for  PPPs,  good  institutional  models  for \npromoting and regulating the use of PPPs, and good practices for managing the \nfiscal risk of PPPs. \n \n6.  The KSP has proved to be an effective country-led platform for sharing experiences in \naddressing the region\u2019s challenges in different sectors.8 The workshops succeeded in sharing \nbest practices and emerging issues and challenges in urban development, transport, farm \nproductivity, vocational training, and PPPs. Post-event evaluation indicated that the participants \nrated the workshops as successful overall and requested that more workshops be organized. In \nparticular, participants said that they learned a lot from projects implemented in the PRC that \ncould be replicated in their countries and they valued the workshop as an effective networking \ntool for policy makers to pave the way for future South\u2013South cooperative initiatives. The \nknowledge-sharing workshop on urbanization led to collaboration between ADB and the College \nof Architecture and Urban Planning of Tongji University to establish the urban knowledge hub in \nMarch 2010, for sharing good practice approaches in urban planning. Subsequently, knowledge \nhubs  covering  the  water  sector  and  eco-compensation  were  established  with  Tsinghua \nUniversity and the Chinese Agricultural University.   \n \n7.   Based  on  the  changing  development  cooperation  landscape  in  the  PRC  and  the \nsuccessful PRC\u2013ADB knowledge-sharing partnership, ADB and the PRC agreed to expand the \nscope of knowledge cooperation and set up the RKSI. On 27 July 2012, a framework agreement \non the RKSI was signed by ADB and the PRC outlining the RKSI\u2019s mandate, objectives, main \nfunctions, organization, and funding arrangements. The RKSI aims to synchronize different \nresources  in  the  same  framework  of  cooperation,  thereby  improving  the  effectiveness  of \nknowledge sharing.   \n \n8.  Under the broader RKSI framework, the KSP continues to serve as a platform to share \nknowledge  developed  within  the  PRC  with  other  countries  and  support  South\u2013South \ncooperation  so  that  this  knowledge  may  translate  to  projects  with  meaningful  impacts  on \npeople\u2019s lives. As its facilitator, ADB is in the best position to evolve the KSP-led dialogue into \nincreased  awareness  of  best  practices  and  lessons  in  addressing  emerging  development \nchallenges among the PRC and DMCs in the region, i.e., climate change; fiscal management; \n                                                \n8   Assessment of previous KSP events was conducted in ADB. 2012. Case Study on South\u2013South Cooperation. \nManila.  \n ", "4   \nPPP agreements; shift towards technical and vocational education; and strengthening high-\nimpact policy recommendations such as in fiscal policy, PPPs, and transformation of colleges \nfor employment. To ensure long-lasting impact, the best practices and knowledge solutions \ndistilled at the KSPs will be captured in case studies and shared within the region through the \nADB knowledge portal. In addition, through targeting DMC participants who are responsible for \ndesigning and implementing ADB-financed projects, the best practices and knowledge solutions \ndisseminated through the KSPs will likely be incorporated in the design of ADB loan projects in \nDMCs and help improve the quality of future investment portfolio and project design.  \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The  impact  of  the  proposed  TA  will  be  enhanced  knowledge  solutions  in  DMCs, \nenhanced knowledge partnerships in DMCs, and strengthened knowledge cooperation between \nthe PRC and other DMCs. The outcome of the proposed TA will be improved effectiveness of \nknowledge sharing. Success in achieving the outcome will be measured by the increased \nparticipation of DMCs in knowledge sharing workshops with the PRC, and improved satisfaction \nof participants in knowledge sharing workshops. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The main outputs of the TA are KSP workshops on key development themes organized, \nand high-impact policy recommendations strengthened. The outputs will be measured by (i) two \nKSP workshops completed by 2017, (ii) initiatives to replicate best practices in DMCs in the \nregion increased by 2017 and interaction of practitioners in DMCs increased by 2017, and (iii) \nthree publications on the results of the workshops completed and disseminated through the \nRKSI and k-Nexus9 by 2017. In preparation for the themed annual workshops, smaller-scale \nseminars may be organized involving PRC researchers, leaders, and staff experts to develop \nthemes and to strengthen ADB\u2019s role as a professional partner and knowledge broker.  \n \n11.  Using the KSP, knowledge sharing activities will be carried out under the TA covering \nkey  development  constraints  and  challenges  facing  the  PRC  and  other  DMCs,  including \ninclusive  economic  growth,  ecological  civilization,  and  regional  cooperation.  Successful \nexperiences and lessons in the PRC will be disseminated to other DMCs and vice versa, \nincluding  knowledge  generated  through  both  ADB  and  non-ADB  projects.  The  TA  will \ncomplement  other  existing  knowledge  sharing  initiatives  under  ADB\u2019s  overall  knowledge \nmanagement  framework10 and  the  PRC\u2019s  country  knowledge  plan,11 which  will  widen  and \nsustain the impact of the TA activities.  \n \n12.  Knowledge work produced under the PRC country knowledge plan by sector divisions \nand the PRC Resident Mission provides good resources and a starting point for issues and \ntheme  identification  in  planning  KSPs.  The  KSP  will  deepen  existing  knowledge  through \nproviding a platform for engaging and increasing interactions among policy makers, research \ninstitutions, and ADB and DMC sector experts. Follow-up dissemination of successful cases and \nlessons  will  be  conducted  through  the  RKSI  and  k-Nexus.  Targeted  activities  to  facilitate \n                                                \n9   k-Nexus is the first database in ADB to list completed and planned knowledge products (publications, multimedia, \ndatabases) and services (events, training, etc.) by all departments, units, sector groups, and thematic groups. \n10  ADB. 2014. Knowledge Management Framework. Manila. \n11  The PRC country knowledge plan is being prepared.  The latest draft was internally shared in mid-October 2015. \n ", "  5 \nreplication of the best practices in other DMCs will be conducted with support from the RKSI and \nresident  missions.  Major  risks  include  (i)  challenges  in  sustaining  knowledge-sharing \ninteractions  among  DMC  partners  after knowledge  sharing  events, (ii)  internal government \nprocesses  delay  the  identification  of  demand  for  knowledge-sharing  activities,  and  (iii) \ninadequate resources of DMCs to participate in knowledge sharing events. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $450,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, policy documents and guidelines, \nstatistical data, information, office space, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n14.  The Ministry of Finance, as the executing agency, will be responsible for supervising and \nmonitoring TA activities. A steering committee, comprising representatives of departments of the \nMinistry of Finance and ADB, will be set up to oversee implementation and provide guidance \nand direction to the consultants. The steering committee will provide guidance on organizing \nprograms, workshops, and seminars; selecting participants; identifying topics for workshops; \nand other TA activities. The composition of the steering committee will be finalized at TA \ninception.  \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented from 1 December 2015 to 30 to November 2017. It will \nrequire 6.5 person-months of international and national consulting services in total to carry out \nthe  terms  of  reference  (Appendix  3).  The  international  and  national  consultants  will  have \nexpertise in training and capacity building, institutional development, economic policy making, \nsocial development, environmental management issues, and regional cooperation.  \n \n16.  The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The consultants will be recruited on an \nindividual basis because varied expertise will be required for the short-term engagement, the \nmain requirements of the assignments are for individual qualifications and experience, and the \nassignments  are  more  on  an  individual  basis.  A  firm  could  have  difficulty  providing \nmultidisciplinary  expertise  over  the  2-year  implementation  period  as  required  by  the  TA. \nResource persons as speakers at knowledge-sharing events will be subject to the limitations \nwith regard to the recruitment and compensation of resource persons under ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants. Proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Promoting Partnerships for South\u2013South \nCooperation II, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \nImpacts the Project is Aligned with \n \nKnowledge solutions enhanced a \nKnowledge partnerships in DMCs enhanced a \nKnowledge cooperation between the PRC and other DMCs strengthened b \n \nPerformance Indicators  Data Sources and \nwith Targets and  Reporting \nResults Chain  Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome       \n  By 2017     \nEffectiveness of  a.
