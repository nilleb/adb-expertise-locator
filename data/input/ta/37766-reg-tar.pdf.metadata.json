The Operations Evaluation Department (OED) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nindependently  evaluates  ADB\u2019s  operations,  including  performance  of  completed  projects, \nprograms, and technical assistance (TA). Evaluation also includes (i) reviewing and selectively \nvalidating self-evaluation activities of operational departments; (ii) providing feedback for the \ndesign and evaluability of new operations; (iii) evaluating the effectiveness of ADB\u2019s policies, \npractices, and procedures; (iv) monitoring, and reporting on, ADB\u2019s and executing agencies\u2019 \nresponse  to  OED  evaluation  recommendations;  (v)  building  evaluation  capacity  within \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs); and (vi) coordinating evaluation practices and activities \nwith other multilateral development banks through the Evaluation Cooperation Group (ECG), \nand with other multilateral and bilateral assistance agencies.1 OED conducts impact and special \nevaluation studies as well as sector and country assistance program evaluations (CAPEs). \nOED\u2019s effectiveness was enhanced when it became an independent department reporting to \nADB\u2019s Board of Directors through its Development Effectiveness Committee (DEC), effective \n1 January 2004.2 \n \n2.  The aims of all ADB\u2019s evaluation activities are to provide lessons for future operations, \naccount  for  use  of  resources,  and  recommend  ways  to  sustain  the  benefits  of  activities \nsupported by ADB. OED independently selects completed projects, programs, and TAs for \nperformance audits. Topics for evaluation studies are selected in coordination with operational \nand other departments. OED\u2019s 2004 work program features (i) an increase in evaluation of \nbroader development agenda such as policies, practices, and procedures, and in evaluation of \nsector and country assistance programs; (ii) a focus on inputs to CAPEs; and (iii) improvement \nof the evaluative content of two OED annual reports. OED\u2019s 2004 work program, which was \nreviewed by the DEC, includes (i) 15 project and 6 program performance audits, and 4 TA \nperformance audits (Appendix 1); (ii) several other outputs of a recurring nature, such as an \nannual review of evaluation activities, and an annual evaluation of portfolio performance; and \n(iii) 13 evaluation studies, of which 7 will be funded under this regional technical assistance \n(RETA).  Generally,  consulting  and  other  services  and  materials  necessary  to  carry  out \nevaluation studies are resourced through RETA funding under ADB\u2019s knowledge products and \nservices  program.  A RETA  framework  for  the  selected  evaluation  studies  for  2004  is  in \nAppendix 2.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Impact  evaluation  studies  seek  to  assess  the  results  of  a  group  of  activities  in  a \nparticular sector, or to compare the results of similar activities in different DMCs. The emphasis \nis on the broad institutional and development impacts of ADB-assisted activities. One impact \nevaluation study is included in the work program. Special evaluation studies are undertaken on \na wide range of topics, frequently policies or strategic concerns of ADB. The work program \nincludes seven special evaluation studies: two on ADB policies, two on specific topics, one on a \nspecific  feature  of  ADB  operations  (cofinancing),  one  on  a  specific  feature  of  project \nimplementation (project implementation units), and one on targeted interventions. Initiated in \n2003, sector assistance program evaluations (SAPEs) assess the relevance, effectiveness, and \nsustainability  of  ADB\u2019s  assistance  with  respect  to  the  sector\u2019s  development  and  financial \nperformance,  as  well  as  the  impact  of  such  aid  on  economic  development  and  poverty \n                                                 \n1  Harmonization of evaluation activities through ECG has focused on good practices for evaluation of individual \noperations. The ECG agenda emphasizes a broad level of evaluations, involving several operations within a sector, \nor a country, or for a particular topic or policy. \n2  ADB. 2003. Enhancing the Independence and Effectiveness of the Operations Evaluation Department. Manila. \n3  The RETA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 19 December 2003. ", "2 \nreduction. The work program includes one SAPE. CAPEs assess the full range of ADB activities \nwithin a particular DMC over a decade or more. CAPEs seek to address issues relating to, and \nmake recommendations on, the focus of ADB activities, including the sector mix and use of \nassistance modalities. CAPEs therefore contribute to assessing current, and formulating new, \ncountry strategies and programs. Given the country focus of ADB operations, country-level \nevaluations will play a large role in evaluation. The work program includes four CAPEs, to be \nundertaken at different times of the year, and completed between 2004 and 2005. \n \n4.  Evaluation studies generally require a longer time and a larger budget than evaluations \nof individual operations. Three or four evaluation studies are expected to be completed in 2005 \nrather  than  2004.  Evaluation  studies  account  for  more  than  25%  of  total  OED  staff  time. \nOperational  and  other  departments  have  a  demand  for  broad  studies  of  development \neffectiveness of ADB operations to provide lessons for all DMCs in the region and for ADB. \n  \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n5.  The purpose of this RETA is to assess the effectiveness of selected ADB operations and \npolicies with respect to their relevance, efficacy, sustainability, impacts, and, where appropriate, \nefficiency; and to provide timely feedback on operational and policy issues to DMCs and ADB. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n6.  The scope of each selected evaluation study of this RETA is as follows: \n \n7.  Sector Assistance Program Evaluation on Asian Development Bank Assistance in \nthe Power Sector in the Philippines. With average electricity consumption at 578 kilowatt-\nhours per capita in 2000, and with more than 80% of its 80 million population having access to \nelectricity, the Philippines is one of the most extensively electrified countries in Asia. However, \nthe power sector is financially unhealthy, tariffs are high, and power supply is unreliable. ADB \nhas been supporting development of the power sector since 1971, through 23 public sector \nloans for $2.1 billion, 3 private sector loans and equity investments for $90.5 million, and 21 TA \ngrants totaling $9.4 million. Coverage has been comprehensive, including power generation, \ntransmission, and distribution. Entering the 1990s, ADB\u2019s assistance increasingly emphasized a \ndevelopment strategy of continued physical investment in system rehabilitation and expansion \ncombined with engagement of the Government on a reform agenda, focusing on unbundling the \nsector,  introducing  competition,  increasing  private  sector  participation,  and  improving  the \nsector\u2019s financial performance.  \n \n8.  The  SAPE\u2019s  objective  is  to  (i)  comprehensively  and  independently  assess  ADB\u2019s \nassistance, on an aggregated basis, with regard to the sector\u2019s development and financial \nperformance, as well as the impact of such assistance on economic development and poverty \nreduction; (ii) identify lessons from the past three decades; and (iii) identify key challenges \nfacing the sector, and strategies to move forward for ADB\u2019s program.  \n \n9.  Special Evaluation Study on the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Policy on Fisheries. \nThe policy was approved in 1997.4 It is anchored on three basic objectives: (i) sustainability in \nconservation  and  utilization  of  fisheries  and  aquatic  resources,  (ii)  equity  in  balancing  the \ninterests of competing resource users, and (iii) efficiency in the development and management \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1997. The Bank\u2019s Policy on Fisheries. Manila.  \n   ", "3 \nof aquatic resources. ADB supports a range of fishing activities, from artisanal to industrial, and \nfrom capture to aquaculture. Three major challenges are recognized: (i) rationalizing domestic \nfishing  activities  and  regulating  access  of  foreign  fleets  into  exclusive  economic  zones; \n(ii) identifying and targeting underexploited fish resources; and (iii) strengthening monitoring, \ncontrol, and surveillance systems. Harnessing aquaculture with minimal environmental costs \nwas also recognized as a major challenge. ADB supports research and development, and \ndissemination of environment-friendly aquaculture technologies.  \n \n10.  The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and relevance of ADB\u2019s \nfisheries  policy  in  (i)  providing  guidance  to  ADB\u2019s  operations  in  the  fisheries  sector, \n(ii) contributing to fisheries management of DMCs, and (iii) promoting regional cooperation in \nfisheries  resource  management.  The  study  will  use  desk  reviews,  field  assessments,  key-\ninformant interviews, and country case studies to derive lessons learned and recommend ways \nto improve the fisheries policy.  \n \n11.  Special Evaluation Study on the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Policy for the Health \nSector. Approved in February 1999, ADB's Health Sector Policy (HSP)5 was set in place to \nprovide direction to ADB operations in the health sector, inform DMCs about ADB priorities, and \nhelp DMCs select priorities and develop strategies to achieve them. The policy recommends \nways to increase ADB\u2019s sector work, loans, and staff in the sector. The HSP highlights five \nstrategic considerations: (i) improving primary health care for vulnerable groups, with particular \nattention to the poor, women, children, and indigenous peoples; (ii) focusing on achieving \ntangible results by improving project quality at entry and during project implementation, and \nstrengthening monitoring and evaluation; (iii) supporting innovations and deployment of new \ntechnologies; (iv) encouraging DMC governments to reform the health sector; and (v) increasing \nefficiency  of  health  sector  investments  by  improving  managerial  capacity,  strengthening \neconomic  and  sector  work,  and  enhancing  intersectoral  linkages.6  The  role  of  health  in \ndevelopment has been accentuated by the adoption of the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs)  by  external  funding  agencies  and  DMCs,  and  regional  recognition  of  health  risks \nassociated  with  communicable  diseases  such  as  HIV/AIDS7  and  severe  acute  respiratory \nsyndrome. Four of the eight MDGs have specific targets for the health status of children and \nwomen, reproductive health, and control of major communicable diseases, reflecting the fact \nthat health is one of the most important priorities for the poor. \n \n12.  The objectives of this study are to (i) evaluate the effectiveness and relevance of the \nHSP; (ii) assess whether the issues and options highlighted are still relevant, particularly in the \ncontext of health issues and problems in the region and DMCs; (iii) assess whether ADB\u2019s \noperational strategies for the health sector are in place to meet the relevant MDGs; (iv) review \nareas where ADB has comparative advantage to make a strategic contribution to the region and \nDMCs; (v) assess ADB\u2019s capability to deliver in the health sector, including staffing; borrower\u2019s \nwillingness to seek assistance from ADB; and appropriateness of existing financial instruments; \n(vi) explore the capacity of the health policy to support and establish direct linkages with specific \nnutrition and population initiatives; and (vii) derive lessons and recommend ways to improve the \nHSP. \n \n13.  Special Evaluation Study on the Effectiveness of Targeted Interventions. As part of \nthe  poverty  reduction  program,  ADB-financed  projects  have  increasingly  been  targeted \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 1999. Policy for the Health Sector. Manila. \n6  Nutrition  issues  were  not  explored  in  detail  in  the  HSP,  but  were  covered  under  the  ADB  Nutrition  and \nDevelopment Series. Population issues were not included in the HSP but were addressed in ADB\u2019s Population \nPolicy of 1994. A separate special evaluation study on nutrition is included in OED\u2019s 2004 work program. \n7  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n ", "4 \ninterventions.  In  the  rural  sector,  for  example,  these  involved  targeting  poor  regions, \ncommunities, and households. Interventions have also been formulated to target particular \nsectors such as primary education and health to directly impact on the non-income dimensions \nof poverty. The effectiveness of targeted interventions, however, is far from clear. For example, \nstudies  on  projects  driven  by  community  demand  report  issues  related  to  local  elites\u2019 \nmanipulation of community demand and investment decisions, as well as these elites\u2019 capture of \nmost project benefits. Studies on microcredit projects reveal constraints on targeting the poorest \nof the poor. In contrast, other studies suggest that indirect poverty reduction through support for \nprivate sector job creation may work well under certain conditions, pointing to the important role \nof labor migration and non-farm employment in reducing rural poverty. \n \n14.  This study aims to answer two basic and related questions: (i) How effective and efficient \nhave poverty reduction interventions been? and (ii) What conditions are necessary to make \nintervention  targeting  efficient  and  effective?  Major  outputs  of  this  study  will  include  (i)  a \ncomparison  of  poverty-reduction  impacts  under  ADB-financed  development  projects  using \nbeneficiary targeting versus those without targeting, and (ii) an analysis of conditions required \nfor successful targeting. The study will involve around five country case studies with multiple \nprojects.  \n \n15.  Special  Evaluation  Study  on  Capital  Market  Assistance.  ADB  has  made \nconsiderable efforts to strengthen and deepen the financial markets in the region, in particular \ncapital markets. Through operations that include lending and TA, ADB has tried to (i) launch or \nstrengthen  institutions  that  provide  long-term  finance  for  infrastructure  projects,  (ii)  enact \nenabling regulations and institutions for private sector growth, and (iii) reduce vulnerabilities in \nthe wake of the East Asian financial crisis.  \n \n16.  This  study  will  examine  ADB\u2019s  efforts  to achieve  these  objectives,  by  summarizing \nexperiences  of  selected  countries  and  analyzing  problems  encountered.  This  study  will \ninvestigate the underlying factors that contribute to successful and less successful assistance, \nand recommend possible future directions for ADB support. The scope of this study includes \n(i) a  comparison  of  country  experiences  with  long-term  support  from  ADB,  design, \nimplementation,  beneficiary  ownership,  and  performance;  and  (ii)  an  investigation  of  the \nconditions for success. Careful attention will be paid to overall status and direction of monetary \nand structural reform policies of the governments. ADB\u2019s experience with emergency lending for \ncapital market reforms will be taken into account to ensure a robust assessment. \n \n17.  Country  Assistance  Program  Evaluation  for  Bhutan.  Occupying  47,000  square \nkilometers, landlocked Bhutan has a population of about 700,000 in 2002. Although a relatively \nlate starter in modern economic development, Bhutan has been spared abject poverty. The \neconomy has fairly consistently exhibited robust growth rates, averaging 6.7% from 1997 to \n2002. In recent years, the main contributors to gross domestic product (GDP) growth have been \nhydroelectric power, construction, and transport. Hydropower is the largest source of domestic \nrevenues, contributing 45% of government revenues and more than 10% of the country\u2019s GDP. \nADB has been one of the principal development partners in socioeconomic development, with \nlending and non-lending activities, primarily in the social, infrastructure, energy, transport, and \nagriculture sectors. Since 1983, ADB has provided 19 loans totaling $111 million, and 85 TA \ngrants for $32 million. \n  \n18.  The purpose of the proposed CAPE is to assess the development effectiveness of ADB \nassistance to Bhutan since the start of ADB operations in 1983. The CAPE will (i) identify overall \nprogram  and  project  strengths  and  weaknesses,  (ii)  assess  institutional  capacity  utilization \nparameters and constraints, (iii) analyze the role of conditionalities and major implementation \n   ", "5 \nissues, (iv) assess the effectiveness of the country strategy process and the extent to which it \nhas served as an important instrument in improving donor coordination, and (v) derive lessons \nlearned and provide recommendations for the future country strategy and program (CSP).  \n \n19.  Country  Assistance  Program  Evaluation  for  Indonesia.  Indonesia  is  ethnically \ndiverse and geographically dispersed, with varied natural and human resources. At the end of \n2002,  Indonesia  was  ADB\u2019s  third  largest  borrower,  with  263  lending  operations  totaling \n$19 billion,  including  social  infrastructure  (24%),  agriculture  and  natural  resources  (21%), \nenergy (18%), finance (16%), and transport and communications (13%). Indonesia has also \nbeen a major beneficiary of TA grants. From 1975 to 2002, it absorbed about 10% of all ADB TA \nfunds ($70 million) in about 320 TA operations. Before 1997, Indonesia\u2019s economic growth had \nbeen rapid. However, the Asian financial crisis exposed a number of key issues confronting the \nnation. Although dropping from a peak of 23.5% at the height of the crisis, poverty incidence \nremained at 18.2% in 2002. Overall economic development depends much on the rich natural \nresource  base.  With  deforestation,  deterioration  of  marine  resources,  and  environmental \nproblems  stemming  from  rapid  urbanization,  issues  of  natural  resource  and  environmental \nmanagement have come to the forefront.  \n \n20.  The CAPE\u2019s objective is to assess the development effectiveness of ADB\u2019s operations in \nIndonesia. In particular, the CAPE will focus on the (i) extent to which ADB\u2019s operations and the \nCSP have addressed priority issues; (ii) level of coordination between ADB and other agencies \nin addressing these issues; (iii) quality of implementation relating to lending and non-lending \noperations; and (iv) impact the overall ADB program has had in achieving the Government\u2019s \ndevelopment goals. The evaluation will concentrate on operations completed in recent years \nand those that are ongoing to assess the relevance, efficacy, efficiency, sustainability, and \nimpact of ADB\u2019s overall assistance to Indonesia. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n21.  The RETA is estimated to cost $1.4 million (Appendix 3). It will be financed by ADB on a \ngrant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  OED will implement the RETA. An evaluation report will be prepared for each selected \nevaluation  study.  OED  staff  will  lead  the  studies  with  the  assistance  of  international  and \ndomestic consultants, who will be recruited individually. Altogether, about 40 person-months of \ninternational and about 75 person-months of domestic consulting inputs will be required. The \nindividual  areas  of  expertise,  duration  of  engagement  of  consultants,  and  outline  terms  of \nreference are in Appendix 4. In keeping with OED\u2019s practice, a position paper for each study \noutlining the detailed approach, methodology, and terms of reference will be prepared before \nengaging consultants and commencing the studies. Consultants will be engaged according to \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the \nengagement of domestic consultants. Operational departments and DMC governments will be \nconsulted at all stages of formulation and implementation, and involved in discussion of results. \nThe RETA will commence in March 2004 and be completed by the end of 2005. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n \n23.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $1,400,000 on a grant basis for Selected Evaluation Studies for \n2004.\n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nEVALUATION REPORTS AND STUDIES TO BE UNDERTAKEN IN 2004 \n \n \nEvaluation Reports and Studies  Number \n         \nA.
