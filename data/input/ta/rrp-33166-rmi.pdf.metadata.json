PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan  to  the  Republic  of  the  Marshall  Islands  (RMI)  for  the  Skills  Training  and  Vocational\nEducation Project.\nII. INTRODUCTION\n2. The RMI is made up of two chains of islands, the Ratak and Ralik groups. The two\nchains together comprise 29 coral atolls and 5 islands about 3,700 kilometers from Hawaii. The\nRMI\u2019s total land area of 180 square kilometers, scattered over 2 million square kilometers of the\nPacific makes it the smallest of the five American-affiliated Pacific territories in Micronesia. Its\nestimated population in 1999 was 50,840. About half of the people live in Majuro Atoll, about 20\npercent in Kwajalein Atoll, and the rest are scattered throughout the RMI.\n3. The RMI has an aid-dependent economy, sustained by large grants from the United\nStates  (US).  In  an  effort  to  promote  economic  development,  greater  self-sufficiency,  and\nreduced  international  dependence,  the  Government,  with  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)\nassistance, introduced several reform measures. These measures included the downsizing of\nthe civil service and reduction of subsidies to enterprises. Current measures are to (i) develop\nthe economy, including the strengthening of the role of the private sector to stimulate economic\ngrowth; and (ii) increase income-generating opportunities for a large number of the population\u2019s\nvulnerable groups, especially women and the youth in the outer islands.\n4. The shortage of well-trained skilled labor has been a major constraint to economic and\nsocial  development.  The  average  educational  level  of  the  labor  force  is  only  six  years  of\nschooling.  ADB  had  recommended  that  an  educated  and  well-trained  skilled  force  is  a\nprerequisite to increasing productive capacity and that the Government introduce reforms in the\neducation and training sectors that have received little attention in the past. At the same time,\nGovernment efforts to generate more jobs and income-generating opportunities for women and\nthe youth are constrained by the absence of employment and self-employment opportunities as\nwell as lack of employable skills, especially in the outer islands.\n5. The Government has initiated several measures to improve the quality of education. At\nthe elementary school level, ADB\u2019s ongoing Basic Education Project.1 has successfully raised\nthe low level of academic proficiency. The Government now plans to introduce corresponding\nreforms in the skills training sector as part of the country\u2019s overall education and training\nreforms. The Government has developed a comprehensive plan to rationalize the vocational\neducation and skills training system. Under this plan, skills training will be reorganized into a\ncomprehensive and integrated national training and certification system with involvement of the\nprivate sector and collaboration among training agencies.\n6. The Government has requested ADB\u2019s assistance to implement the new vocational\neducation and skills training plan to develop a national vocational education and skills training\nsystem.\n                                                          \n1 Loan 1249(SF)-RMI: Basic Education Project, for $ 8.0 million, approved on 9 September 1993.", "2\nIII. BACKGROUND\n7. The 1999 Pacific Human Development Report ranks the RMI eighth (down from fifth in\n1994) among the Pacific developing member countries (PDMCs), with a human development\nindex of 0.563. This was calculated from a composite measure of life expectancy at birth of 65\nyears, adult literacy rate of 74 percent, combined gross enrollment ratio of 72 percent, and real\ngross domestic product (GDP) per capita of $1,882.2 With a human poverty index of 18.7, the\nRMI ranks eighth in terms of poverty among the 12 PDMCs. This reflects a composite of people\nnot expected to survive to age 40 (13 percent), illiterate adults (26 percent), underweight\nchildren under 5 (17 percent), and people without access to safe water (18 percent) or health\nservices (5 percent). The low ranking status of the RMI reflects the poor quality of education\navailable and the high cost of delivering services to a scattered population. The shortage of\nskilled people at all levels is a major barrier to economic development. Education attainment is\nlow, with average years of schooling being only 8.5 years. Important factors in relation to this\nare low quality of elementary education and lack of access to education in the outer islands.\n8. Distribution of resources and of incomes lacks regional equity, resulting in a highly\ndualistic economy. In 1991, average per capita incomes in the capital were around three times\nhigher than those in the outer islands, while per capita incomes in the wealthiest quintile of\nhouseholds was 3.5 times higher than those in the poorest quintile of households. The RMI\neconomy  grew  less  than  1  percent  in  1999  after  three  years  of  recession  caused  by  a\ncombination of drought and the short-term impacts of Government expenditure cuts associated\nwith the reform process. Real GDP remains low, approximately 25 percent less than in 1995. In\nper capita terms, current value GDP fell by over 17 percent in the same period.\n9. Despite a downward trend, inflation has been relatively high, averaging 5.5 percent per\nannum in 1995-1999. Although exports fell by 6 percent in 1995-1998, imports also fell by 24\npercent in the same period, resulting in a decline in the trade deficit. The fiscal situation remains\nprecarious partly due to reduction in import tax rate and past due obligations. Oil price increases\nare  expected  to  have  an  impact,  and  the  new  Government  is  saddled  with  financial\ncommitments made by the previous government, including purchase of new aircraft. Some relief\nmay  be  possible  from  increase  in  fishing  revenue,  further  public  service  downsizing,  and\nbilateral  funding.  Despite  the  short-term  political  and  personal  costs,  there  has  been\nimprovement in governance, particularly since the new Government took office. New legislation\nhas been prepared to simplify the processes associated with private sector investment. The\nquality of economic management in the coming years will be crucial to ensure sustainable\neconomic growth into the future.\n10. Women are disadvantaged in all areas of the economy and society despite the mainly\nmatrilineal society. Female literacy rates are around 13 percent lower than those of men. Few\nwomen are in senior positions of leadership in Government and women\u2019s and infant health is a\nkey area of concern; in fact infant mortality, total fertility, and teenage fertility rates in the RMI\nare the highest of all PDMCs, while contraceptive use is among the lowest. The high fertility rate\nhas a follow-on impact on the general health of women.\n                                                          \n2 UNDP. 1999. Pacific Human Development Report::Creating Opportunities.", "3\nA. The Education Sector\n1.  Elementary Education\n11. The structure of education consists of eight years of elementary schooling (grades 1 to\n8) followed by four years of high school (grades 9 to 12). Elementary education is mandatory\nwhile entry into secondary education is subject to competitive entrance examinations. Public\nand private schools provide both levels of education.\n12. In  school  year  2000  (SY2000),  the  RMI  had  104  elementary  schools  and  a  total\nenrollment of 11,687. Female students were almost equally represented, accounting for about\n48.5 percent (5,669 students) of all elementary students. The elementary schools had 632\nteachers. The teacher student ratio was 1:20 in public elementary schools and 1:15 in private\nelementary schools.\n13. Elementary schools are few and far between and are available in only 24 of the 29 atolls,\nwith 10 atolls having only one elementary school each.3 Because the RMI\u2019s population is highly\ndispersed, the schools are small in size, averaging an enrollment of 112 students. Many schools\nin the outer islands have less than 50 students in grades 1 to 8. Often, one or two teachers\nteach all the grades in these schools. Because of the long distances involved in walking to\nschool and the difficult geographical and weather conditions in the islands, many children do not\nattend school. Despite compulsory elementary education, school participation rates are low,\nwith about 3,500 children 6-14 (30 percent) not attending school.\n2. Secondary Education\n14. At the end of grade 8, students take a national test to gain entry into high schools.\nSecondary education is available only in four atolls (Kwajalein and Majuro have five and eight\nhigh schools, respectively, while Jaluit and Wotje have one each). There are only 3 public\nschools among the 18 high schools in the country. The total enrollment in public and private\nschools was 2,498 in SY2000. Female students were well represented at the secondary level,\naccounting for 49 percent of total enrollment. The high schools had 187 teachers, providing a\ngenerous teacher student-ratio of 1:14. High schools are also small in enrollment with an\naverage of about 140 students in grades 9 to 12. Students in the outer islands who gain entry\ninto high schools migrate to Ebeye or Majuro to continue their studies, or cease schooling.\nStatistical data on education is at Appendix 1.\n15. Only about 35-40 percent of students who take the entrance test in grade 8 are admitted\ninto the limited places in high schools. In 1998, of the 1,218 students who took the tests, only\n481 (39.5 percent) were admitted into grade 9. Similarly, in 1999, only 488 students (35.3\npercent) of the 1,384 who took the test gained admission. The high rate of failures is also the\nresult of the low level of educational achievement at the elementary level where students\u20194 basic\ncompetencies are poor in many subjects, including English, mathematics, and science. About\n1,460 children of the 15-18 age group do not attend school.\n                                                          \n3 Under the ADB-assisted Basic Education Project, a middle school for 720 students is being constructed to increase\nstudent enrollment.\n4 ADB-assisted Basic Education Project is addressing some of the weaknesses in elementary education.", "4\n3.  School Dropouts\n16. The school dropout rate is high at all levels. Results from ongoing National Standards\nBureau  monitoring  of  student  enrollment  show  that  there  are  approximately  30  percent  of\nincoming  first  graders  who  dropout  before  grade  eight  and  approximately  57  percent  of\nincoming ninth graders in high school drop out before graduation. The data suggests that of\nevery 100 students who begin grade 1, about 13 will graduate from high school. The 1999\ncensus  recorded  that  30.5  percent  of  students  enrolled  elementary  schools  do  not  attend\nschool. The dropout rate is particularly high at the end of the elementary level when students\ntake the high school entrance test. The number admitted depends on the number of places\navailable, which are allotted to the top-scoring examinees.\n4. Postsecondary Education\na. College of the Marshall Islands\n17. Postsecondary education is provided in the College of the Marshall Islands (CMI) in\nMajuro. CMI is an autonomous community college providing two- and three-year programs for\nstudents in the Micronesian region. CMI is the designated postsecondary institution for the RMI\nresponsible for the development of human resources in a number of areas. CMI has been fully\naccredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. CMI\u2019s main campus is in\nMajuro where the college offers associate degree and certificate programs in teacher education,\nliberal arts, and vocational and occupational education and training. In the fall semester of 1999,\nthere was a total of approximately 650 students attending part-time and full-time courses. In that\nsame year, 58 students graduated with associate degrees. Other programs include the adult\neducation program, which offers youth and adults a second opportunity to complete high school\neducation, or attend postsecondary training to have a better chance for employment. English\nand mathematics are taught to make trainees functionally literate to help them pass the General\nEquivalency Diploma. Since SY1993, 1,726 students have participated in these courses and\n246  gained  the  diploma.  A  total  of  91  students  gained  employment  or  improved  their\nemployment position while another 206 went on to other education and training programs in\nCMI, colleges in the US, and the Job Corps Program. CMI\u2019s profile is in Appendix 2.\n18. CMI runs a branch campus in Ebeye where it offers associate degree and certificate\nprograms similar to those in the main campus in Majuro. Courses include nursing, business,\naccounting, management, computer, education, engineering, and liberal arts. In the spring\nsemester of 2000, CMI had 108 part-time and full-time students, including 52 females and 56\nmales. The branch campus opened in 1996 and is in an early stage of development. It has\ngraduated 3 students.\n19. Over the years, CMI has been expanding its facilities on its two campuses through\nGovernment support and its own initiative. In 1998, ADB provided assistance under the Basic\nEducation Project to build a dormitory for about 30 teachers from the outer islands. CMI added a\nbuilding with offices for the staff. CMI has upgraded its Ebeye campus where it refurbished the\nsix  classrooms  of  an  abandoned  elementary  school  building  close  to  the  campus.  It  also\npurchased and rehabilitated two unoccupied houses to provide accommodation for its staff to\nattract teachers to the campus in the remote island.", "5\nb.  University of the South Pacific Branch in Majuro\n20. The University of the South Pacific (USP) has a university center in Majuro. USP was\nestablished in 1968 by 12 island countries in the Pacific. Marshallese high school students with\nhigh grade point averages are admitted to USP\u2019s one-year preparatory program for admission\ninto colleges in the Pacific, Australia, and New Zealand. Several promising students have\nbenefited from these programs.\n5. Vocational Education in High Schools\n21. Vocational education is provided mainly in the RMI\u2019s three public schools: Marshall\nIslands high school (MIHS) in Majuro, Jaluit high school in Jaluit, and Northern Islands high\nschool in Wotje. Vocational education comprises prevocational education in grades 9 and 10\nand vocational education electives in grades 11 and 12. Prevocational education is designed to\nintroduce students to the work environment and the various vocational options open to them.\nStudents are expected to learn simple skills, use of tools, and production processes to enable\nthem to grasp vocational concepts in several occupational areas. These include agriculture,\nfood  preservation,  elementary  construction,  cooking,  sewing,  gardening,  and  fishing.  But\nbecause of inadequate funding and resources, the programs have not been very effective, and\nstudents are not prepared and motivated for vocational electives in grades 11 and 12.\n22. Vocational education electives are aimed at equipping students with occupational skills\nand developing their aesthetic and intellectual skills to enable them to participate in personal,\nfamily, community, and national affairs. A wide range of vocational electives is offered. They\ninclude agriculture, auto mechanics, basic electricity, bookkeeping, childcare, typing, shorthand,\nspeedwriting,  construction,  cooking,  sewing,  drafting,  economics,  general  business,  home\neconomics, home garden skills, home maintenance and repair, small appliance repair, and\nwoodworking. The number of students in most vocational elective courses is small although\nsome courses (such as home economics, computer, and agriculture) have higher enrollments.\nVocational education is, therefore, not cost effective. A few private schools (e.g., Assumption\nhigh school in Majuro, the Queen of Peace high school, and the Seventh Day Adventist high\nschool in Ebeye) offer limited vocational education in home economics, secretarial services,\nwoodwork, sewing, and auto mechanics.\n23. In addition to vocational education, high schools also run a school-to-work program that\nduplicates much of the vocation education programs in grades 9 to 12. It also results in wastage\nof scarce resources, low quality of vocational education, and significantly reduced teaching time\nfor academic subjects.\n6. Skills Training\na.  Job Training Partnership Act Programs\n24. Skills training in the nonformal sector is funded by the US federal government under the\nJob Training Partnership Act (JTPA), which was established to provide Marshallese, who face\nsevere labor market constraints, with support and training to increase their opportunities to find\nemployment.\n25. JTPA programs, which were run in collaboration with CMI, provided training and services\nto participants and maintained a close relationship with ongoing development programs. JTPA\nalso  provided  school  alternative  programs  whereby  dropouts  were  able  to  improve  their", "6\neducational  competencies  and  return  to  mainstream  education.  JTPA  received  an  annual\nbudget of about $800,000 and operated a wide range of programs, which were provided in the\ntwo CMI training centers in Ebeye and Majuro. The courses included automotive mechanics, air\nconditioning  and  refrigeration,  building  maintenance,  carpentry  and  construction,  electricity,\nsecretarial, sewing, and welding. During 1994-1999, about 1,620 youths and adults, including\n543 females (33.5 percent), participated in seven JTPA programs: occupational skills training,\ninstitutional skills training, cooperative work experience, entrepreneurship and small business\noperation, preemployment work maturity skills training, school enhancement, and summer youth\nemployment and training. A total of 393 youth and adults including 84 females were placed in\nemployment. Nineteen students including 10 females gained places in high schools. The JTPA\nprograms closed in June 2000 and were replaced by the Work Investment Act (WIA) program.\n7. Work Investment Act\n26. Specifically,  the  WIA  facilitates  training  to  produce  a  skilled  workforce  based  on\nnationally recognized skill standards and strives to maximize the use and management of the\ncountry\u2019s natural and human resources. WIB\u2019s main tasks are to (i) increase self-reliance of\nMarshallese, (ii) reduce dependence on outside resources and aid through the provision of\nservices and training programs tailored to meet the needs of the individual and public and\nprivate sectors, and (iii) foster collaboration among related agencies. When the WIA came into\neffect, the Government set up the Work Investment Board (WIB) in August 2000 to administer\nthe WIA and meet its requirements.\n27. WIB supports summer employment opportunities, work experience, occupational skill\ntraining,  leadership  development  opportunities,  and  guidance  and  counseling.  It  supports\nentrepreneurial activities with \u201cincubator\u201d entrepreneurial projects by providing equipment, rent,\ntransportation,  materials,  and  start-up  assistance.  This  will  provide  on-the-job  training  for\nentrepreneurs  in  business  skills  and  act  as  a  showcase  for  educating  the  masses  in\nentrepreneurial and self-employment opportunities. WIB also supports the alternative school\nprograms, which enable dropouts and delinquent youth to return to school. To foster greater\nself-reliance, WIB supports local governments interested in developing sustainable agriculture,\nfishing, and other subsistence activities in the outer islands.\n28. WIB operates through one-stop centers, which are responsible for developing programs\nand identifying suitable training providers to conduct training on behalf of WIB. The one-stop\ncenters provide comprehensive services to trainees, trained workers, employers, and training\nproviders.  The  centers  do  not  conduct  any  training  themselves  but  commission  training\nproviders to do so. They also assist and advise potential trainees to find suitable training\nvenues, help trained workers find jobs, and assist employers to find suitably trained workers.\nWIB has set up a one-stop center at Majuro. Another center will be built on the CMI campus in\nEbeye, which is the second largest populated area and a significant employment market for\ntrained skilled workers for the contractor who provides human resources to the US Kwajalein\nMissile Range. Two subcenters are also planned for Jaluit and Wotje. The subcenters will be\nthe focal points for planning all outer islands training. This decentralized approach will allow the\nflexibility needed to assess and address the unique conditions of the varied social, economic,\neducational, and training needs of the RMI. WIB staff will head each of the one-stop centers and\nsubcenters, and the director of the one-stop center in Majuro will coordinate the activities of all\nfour centers. Programs available in the RMI are in Appendix 3.\n ", "7\n8. Skills Training Centers\n29. CMI is the primary skills training provider in the RMI. It conducts skills training for mid-\nlevel skills workers in its two centers in Ebeye and Majuro. CMI has experience in conducting\ntraining  under  the  JTPA  programs  and  is  currently  upgrading  its  training  and  educational\nfacilities in both campuses to (i) meet the new requirements of the WIA and provide better\ntraining programs in order to qualify for assistance under the WIA, and (ii) maintain its status of\nfull accreditation by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. In 1999, CMI converted\nan abandoned cafeteria of the MIHS at Rita into a center for training skilled workers.\n30. Skills training is also available at the CMI Ebeye campus. The campus is housed in an\nold and large renovated two-storied military building. There are currently seven classrooms, a\ncomputer room, a students\u2019 lounge, a bookstore, and four administration offices. The campus\nruns  skills  training  courses  in  carpentry,  electricity,  and  secretarial  services.  The  college\ncollaborates with the training staff on the military base in Kwajalein to develop training programs\nand place students for on-the-job training, and draws part-time teachers from among the staff of\nthe base.\n31. CMI has prepared to assume its role as the leading skills training provider in the RMI by\nrenovating the abandoned high school cafeteria at Rita in Majuro into a training center and\nexpanding its modest facilities at its Ebeye Training Center, and designating a senior CMI staff\nmember as the director of skills training. The director will be responsible for the planning,\ncoordination, and delivery of all CMI skills training. CMI has also designated two members of its\nstaff as the managers of the training centers in Jaluit and Wotje. CMI is thus adequately\nprepared to meet the challenges of the new skills development program.\n9. Technician Training\n32. Postsecondary programs for training technicians are offered at CMI and its branch\ncampus in Ebeye. The main campus in Majuro runs associate degree and certificate vocational\nand occupational courses in nursing, business, and occupational trades. Two-year programs in\nbusiness  studies  and  office  administration  lead  to  the  Associate  of  Science  Degree.  The\nbusiness  studies  and  office  administration  course  includes  management,  accounting,  and\ncomputer science and is designed for those who wish to work in the business sector. The office\nadministration  course  prepares  students  for  careers  in  a  business  office  environment  and\nincludes  training  in  keyboarding,  office  procedures,  word  processing,  interpersonal  skills,\nbusiness English, business mathematics, organizational skills, and accounting. The Department\nof  Vocational  and  Occupational  Education  provides  two-year  programs  in  architectural\nengineering  leading  to  the  Associate  of  Science  Degree  and  an  individualized  education\nprogram leading to an Associate of Science Degree in automotive technology or building trades.\n33. The CMI campus in Ebeye also offers postsecondary programs for training technicians,\nsimilar to programs offered in the main campus in Majuro.\n10. Teacher and Instructor Training\n34. Teachers  and  instructors  for  vocational  education  and  skills  training  programs  are\nrecruited in several ways. Some are graduates of CMI, others are recruited through open\nadvertisement, and others are trained in the Guam Community College,  which recently moved\nfrom Guam to Palau. This college was set up in 1994 to train teachers for nine island countries\nin the region, including the RMI, under the US-funded Instructor Development Program of the", "8\nPacific Regional Educational Laboratory, with headquarters in Hawaii. The program focuses on\nvocational  curriculum  development  and  instructor  training  in  a  broad  range  of  vocational\nsubjects at the secondary school level. The RMI receives about $120,000 annually under the\nUS federal grant for vocational education and this is used to train about four teachers every\nyear.  Teachers  attend  vocational  training  and  pedagogic  courses  for  eight  weeks  during\nsummer vacations for four consecutive years to qualify for an associate degree. Seven teachers\nfrom public high schools in the RMI have received associate degrees under this program.\nPrivate schools do not receive any assistance to train teachers.\n11. Skills Training for Women and Youth\n35. The Women\u2019s Division in the Ministry of Internal Affairs is responsible for promoting\nequality and gender awareness in the community, coordinating training programs to support\nimprovements in women\u2019s lives, monitoring the status of women in the RMI, and acting as the\nfocal point for all support and assistance to women. The Women\u2019s Division works closely with\nthe National Council of Women. A major activity of the Women\u2019s Division is implementing the\nWomen\u2019s National Policy, which aims to improve the health and educational status and welfare\nof women. Prior to budget cuts under the Public Sector Reform Program, the Women\u2019s Division\norganized several training programs and conducted training and income-generating activities for\nwomen\u2019s groups throughout the islands. Now, without funds, the Women\u2019s Division acts mainly\nas  a  clearing  house  and  a  meeting  place  for  the  National  Council  of  Women  and\nnongovernment organizations (NGOs). Traditional attitudes continue to influence the level and\nscope of women\u2019s participation in economic growth and social development.\n36. The health and education profile of the RMI is discouraging and compares with those of\nmuch poorer countries. The poor health of the population is due to poor nutrition; approximately\n56.5 percent of adults aged 18-50 years are overweight or obese.5 One in two adults is likely to\ndevelop symptoms of diabetes and similar illnesses. The overall life expectancy in the Marshall\nIslands is 68 years\u201466 years for males and 69 years for females\u2014both well below average life\nexpectancies in many neighboring island countries. In recent years, domestic violence due to\nalcohol abuse and other forms of violence against women have increased.\n37. With the budget cut in the Women\u2019s Division and elsewhere, the training and income-\ngenerating  opportunities  open  to  women  was  reduced.  In  the  outer  islands,  subsistence\nagriculture, handicrafts, and coastal fisheries, combined with the traditional extended family\nsystem, help to maintain a social safety mechanism to ensure the basic needs of food and\nshelter. With reduced income levels and fewer job opportunities island communities are now\nmotivated  to  revive  subsistence  activities  for  consumption  and  sale,  and  to  exploit  island\nresources. But the communities need adequate management, entrepreneurial, and other skills\nto do this. In the island communities, women facilitate and supplement the subsistence living\nstandards by ensuring that family obligations to the community are met while the household is\nkept together. Handicraft production has been a perennial activity especially for women, and\nsupplements income from copra and coastal fishing. After the public reform period, the onus is\neven greater for women to ensure that community and family obligations are met.\n12. Administration of Education\n38. The responsibility for the overall development and administration of education at all\nlevels, including technical and vocational education, lies with the Ministry of Education (MOE).\n                                                          \n5 Findings from a survey conducted by John Hopkins University between 1996 and 1997.", "9\nMOE is headed by a minister, assisted by the secretary of education who administers and\nimplements Government education policies and oversees the administration of education in the\ncountry.  The  National  Board  of  Education  advises  the  minister  on  public  school  curricula,\neducation standards, CMI, and other education matters. MOE is divided into three bureaus,\neach headed by an undersecretary: (i) the Elementary and Secondary Education Bureau is\nresponsible for the development of school education including, prevocational and vocational\neducation and training, school liaison, and logistic support to schools; (ii) the Curriculum and\nInstructional Services Bureau is responsible for the design and development of curriculum and\ninstructional  materials;  and  (iii)  the  Administration  and  Instructional  Support  Services  is\nresponsible  for  administration  and  finance.  The  three  directorates  in  the  Elementary  and\nSecondary  Education  Bureau  are  responsible  for  elementary,  secondary,  and  vocational\neducation. The director of vocational education is responsible for vocational education programs\nin  schools.  Currently,  he  is  the  only  staff  person  in  the  department  dealing  directly  with\nvocational education. The MOE organization chart is in Appendix 4.\n13. Financing of Education\n39. MOE\u2019s annual budget is made of a mix of Compact6 funds and specific education grants.\nCurrently, MOE receives funding for education from a number of sources, the main ones being\nthe General Fund, Compact Tied Fund, Special Revenue Fund, and Federal Fund. The General\nFund primarily supports several administrative and monitoring divisions of MOE and elementary\neducation. The Compact Tied Fund provides annual grants of $1.8 million mainly for financing\nthe RMI\u2019s three public high schools. The Compact Fund also provides about $797,000 annually\nin scholarships to Marshallese to study in US colleges. The Federal Fund is given for specific\nprograms such as assisting handicapped children, preschooling, and training. In 1998, MOE\nreceived a total of $1.48 million from all funds including $1.33 million for recurrent expenditure. It\nreceived $1.5 million for capital expenditure. About 75 percent of the General Fund is spent on\nelementary  education,  only  2  percent  on  secondary  education,  and  22  percent  on\npostsecondary education. MOE\u2019s budget is provided in Appendix 5.\n40. The budget for vocational education and skills training programs comes largely from the\nGeneral Fund, Compact Tied Fund, and Federal Fund. An exact breakdown of expenditure on\nvocational education is not available as it is included in the secondary education allotment.\nEstimates indicate that in FY1999, the Directorate of Vocational Education in MOE received\n$120,000 for vocational programs in the three public schools, while the JTPA received $840,000\nfor its programs. The National Training Council (NTC) gets its funding from the levy imposed on\nforeign nationals working in the RMI, which has averaged about $180,000 annually. NTC also\nreceives aid from international bodies such as the United Nations Development Programme\n(UNDP) which provided assistance to develop skill standards in a few trade areas. CMI received\nabout $900,000 in FY1999. For FY2000, the Government had proposed a budget of the same\namount for all the allocations.\n41. CMI\u2019s main revenue is from tuition fees (61 percent in FY1999), which are $95 per credit\nfor a resident student and $105 per nonresident student. The rest is from Government subsidy\nand other income, which in 1999 amounted to $2,364 per student. Most students receive\nFederal Pell Grants, the maximum for which is $3,300 per year In FY1998, the Department of\nVocational and Occupational Trade spent $89,480. In 1996, CMI established the Endowment\nTrust Fund toward achieving financial stability of the college. CMI is targeting $20 million, which\nwill enable it to be self sustaining and less dependent on US federal scholarship programs and\n                                                          \n6 Compact of Free Association with the US.", "10\nfluctuating annual local appropriations. CMI estimates that when the target of $20 million is\nreached, it will be able to finance about 80 percent of its current operating expenditure through\nreturns on investments. To date, the Endowment Trust Fund has about $200,000. CMI is\nseeking US nonprofit status, which would make contributions to the Endowment Trust Fund tax-\nexempt for US citizens.\n14. Economic and Labor Market Considerations\na. Market Analysis\n42. The RMI may be divided into four distinct economic areas: Majuro, the capitol and\nlargest population center; Ebeye, in Kwajalein Atoll, the second largest population center and\nthe site of the missile testing range for the US army; subcenters of Jaluit and Wotje; and the\nremaining \u201couter islands,\u201d which are home to approximately one third of the population.\n43. An  economic  goal  of  the  Government  is  greater  self-sufficiency  in  agriculture.  The\noverall strategic objective for the development of agriculture is to optimize the generation of in-\nkind and monetary income (i.e., food and cash) from agriculture. Another goal is to develop\nfisheries marine resources. Majuro has established a fish processing (\u201cloining\u201d) plant, which\nemploys 320 workers. Ebeye has built, with Japanese aid, a fish market that imports fish and\nsells local produce from three neighboring atolls, Ailinglaplap, Likiep, and Namu, which have\nbuilt fish holding centers in their atolls. Arno, a neighbor atoll to Majuro, has completed a fish\nbase  (facilities  for  landing,  sorting,  and  storing  fish  catches).  Jaluit  is  in  the  process  of\nconstructing a fish base and plans are set for the atolls of Mili and Aur to build bases in the near\nfuture.\n44. Ecotourism, the third priority of the Government, is still largely in the planning stages.\nMajuro has a resort, and Bikini has a dive resort. Other ecotourism plans are being made for\nJaluit,  Kwajalein,  and  Mili  atolls.  The  Ministry  of  Resources  and  Development  is  also\ninvestigating the feasibility of pearl farming.7 Throughout the RMI, there is a pressing need for\nmore and better-trained teachers.\n45. The  completion  and  start  up  of  new  retail  stores  in  Majuro  seems  to  indicate  an\nexpansion in retail related employment. In addition, transportation and related industries and\nservices will continue to increase, particularly as the population and businesses can only find\nland further out long the 50 kilometer (km) stretch of the atoll. In the past year, three new car\ndealerships have opened in the capitol. As the outer islands develop fisheries, more vessels will\nbe needed, and as the RMI\u2019s airline increases its capacity to serve the outer islands, a variety of\nemployees will be needed to support this expansion. Skilled workers will be required in all these\nareas.\n46. In addition, initial surveys from the private sector indicated the need for higher level or\nmid-to-upper level training to enable Marshallese to replace nonlocal personnel. An associated\nproblem is that while many students do go abroad for higher education, few of them return to\nthe RMI, preferring to remain in the United States. Their places need to be filled too.\n47. Ebeye Island is 5 km from the main island for the Kwajalein Missile Range and provides\nthe Marshallese labor force for the island. The Raytheon Company, which is contracted by the\nUS army, employs over 1,000 Marshallese in a variety of positions. No large expansion is\n                                                          \n7 Interview with Ministry of Resources and Development personnel, February 2000.", "11\nexpected to take place; however, wide range of entry-level jobs are available, from trades to\nfood service, and need to be filled on an ongoing basis as employees leave their jobs for\nvarious reasons. However, although some Marshallese have risen to positions of responsibility\nafter an extended period of time, few are in managerial or technical positions largely due to the\nlack  of  qualifications.  CMI,  in  collaboration  with  the  Raytheon  training  staff,  has  begun  to\naddress this problem with a training program that has successfully placed two graduates in\ncomputer technician positions, one graduate in the engineering master planner\u2019s office, and\nseveral in secretarial positions previously occupied by Americans. Jobs Corps operates a center\non Kwajalein, which prepares Marshallese youth for transfer to US Job Corps sites for further\ntraining. Many out-of-school youth, however, cannot take advantage of this opportunity due to\ntheir extremely low competency in English.\n48. Economic development on Ebeye is limited due to the population density of the island.\nThe scarcity of land limits construction of new buildings. However, many services, from air-\nconditioning repair and maintenance and other maintenance-related jobs need to be developed.\nThere are plans to build a dive resort to capitalize on the various World War II wrecks and other\nexcellent diving opportunities found in the lagoon; however, these plans remain on the drawing\nboard.\n49. Jaluit  has  made  good  progress  toward  establishing  the  infrastructure  for  further\neconomic development. Its power plant is operating and can of support continued economic\nexpansion, and its wharf is in good condition and capable of docking the larger ships that travel\nto  and  from  the  centers.  Communication  by  satellite  phone  and  facsimile  has  also  been\nestablished. A fishery is being established and plans are being made for an ecoresort. Marshalls\nEnergy Company has plans for a power plant in Wotje. Wotje, which has some of the most\nfertile soil in the RMI, is planning on increasing agriculture output by diversifying its production\nof food crops.\n50. Economic activity on the outer islands is still mainly at the subsistence level although\nsome initiatives have been taken to develop the economy. These initiatives mostly involve food\nproduction and fish catch to be exported to the centers of Ebeye and Majuro. A major initiative\nin the outer islands is development of alternative energy sources. Three of the outer islands are\nalready using solar power to provide electricity.  This push for alternative energy sources will\nnecessitate, in turn, the development of supply and distribution centers in the major atolls to\nsupport them. The Government is cognizant of the importance of economic development in the\nouter islands as a means to slow or reverse migration to the urban centers and the resulting\neconomic and social problems that this migration causes. The legislature has passed a bill,\nwhich  will  make  Enewetak,  the  RMI\u2019s  westernmost  atoll,  the  country\u2019s  third  port  of  entry.\nInfrastructure development and training of personnel to operate the port will provide a significant\nnumber of job opportunities.\nb. Labor Force\n51. The size of the working age population (people aged 15 years and older) is about\n28,700: 14,600 males and 14,100 females. The economically active population of the total labor\nforce is about 14,700 people\u20149,679 males (66 percent of all males) and 4,908 females (35\npercent  of  all  females).  In  1999,  private  employment  comprised  40.6  percent  of  the  total\nemployed  population;  Government,  30.6  percent;  and  self-employment,  25.8  percent.  The\nremaining 3 percent were employers, unpaid, and paid workers in family businesses.", "12\n52. The total number of employed persons, based on the 1999 census, is 10,141 which is\n69.1 percent of the total labor force. The unemployed comprises 30.9 percent of the total labor\nforce. This is more than double the unemployment rate in 1988, which was 12.5 percent. In fact,\nthe  total  number  employed  in  1999  is  almost  the  same  as  1988.  The  increase  in  the\nunemployment rate is probably the result of the lack of new jobs as well as downsizing of the\nGovernment workforce. The unemployment rate for females was 37.3 percent and for males,\n27.6 percent.\n53. The total lack of employment growth between 1988 and 1999, when vast sums were\nbeing spent on stimulating economic growth, suggests that it will be difficult to find even a\nfraction of the jobs needed to achieve an equilibrium between the 800-1,000 job seekers a year\nand available job opportunities. With expanded markets for atoll-lagoon marine products, tuna\ntransshipment services, and tourism (all of which are far from certain to occur), the potential for\nnew jobs is in the range of 100-300 a year, except for projects such as the new fish processing\n(\u201cloining\u201d) plant in Majuro, which employs 300 people.\n54. Every effort is being made to make the RMI a competitive and attractive place for foreign\ndirect investment, and for profitable expansion of existing enterprises. The Government\u2019s efforts\nto improve the investment climate (assisted by ADB) have resulted in substantially increased\nemployment in the fisheries sector, including the 300 new jobs in the fish processing (\u201cloining\u201d)\nplant. These efforts can lead to real economic growth and an increase in new jobs. However,\nthe growth is unlikely to be sufficient to absorb the increasing number of job seekers. Under the\nCompact, RMI citizens can live and work in the United States, and some will do so. While\nstrategies to promote private sector-led economic growth, strengthen financial management,\nand improve governance are put in place, a qualified and skilled workforce is also needed.\nEventually,  wages  in  the  RMI  which  are  much  higher  than  in  many  of  the  RMI\u2019s  natural\ncompetitors, will need to fall, and technical skill and output per person will need to rise if the RMI\nis to gain any comparative advantage. The Project addresses only one aspect of the overall\neconomic and financial challenge.\n55. By  occupational  groups,  the  production  workers,  laborers,  and  transport  equipment\noperators comprise the largest percentage of the RMI\u2019s employed population (24.4 percent),\nfollowed by the agricultural workers and fishermen (20.5 percent). By gender, the largest group\nof employed males are in agriculture and related group (26.2 percent), followed by  the second\nlargest  group  of  employed  males  composed  of  production  workers,  transport  equipment\noperators, and construction workers (25.4 percent). By comparison, among female workers, the\nclerical workers is the largest group, comprising 26.5 percent of employed females, followed by\nthose engaged in production jobs constituting 18.9 percent.\n56. By industry group, the largest percentage of both male and female workers belong to the\ngroup \u201ccommunity, social, and personal services,\u201d with males in this industry accounting for 35.6\npercent of all male workers, and the females, 41.8 percent of all female workers. This is to be\nexpected,  since  this  industry  group  includes  service  workers,  government  officials,\nprofessionals, and technical and related workers such as medical workers and teachers. The\nnext largest industry group for men is \u201celectricity, gas, and water\u201d (11.9 percent), and that for\nwomen is \u201c\u2018manufacturing\u201d (21.7 percent). Most women under the \u201cmanufacturing\u201d group are\nengaged in handicrafts.", "13\n15. Key Issues\na. Ineffective  Vocational Education Programs\n57. Vocational education programs particularly lack relevance to the work environment and\ndo not articulate with the nonformal skills training programs. Prevocational programs in grades 9\nand  10  are  not  well  organized  and  are  not  effective  in  introducing  students  to  the  work\nenvironment and to the vocational options open to them. Tools and teaching materials skills are\ntoo scarce to enable students to appreciate simple production processes or grasp vocational\ncareer concepts.\n58. High schools offer a large number of vocational electives in grades 11 and 12 but lack\nfacilities, equipment, operating funds, trained teachers, and organized and efficient programs.\nVocational electives are developed without the involvement of industry and the private sector\nand without training need assessments. There is little consultation with employers to assess\nskilled  needs  for  human  resources.  This  has  resulted  in  a  mismatch  between  vocational\neducation and the job market. In many cases, the number of students taking electives is less\nthan 10; too few for the programs to be cost-effective. In addition, because equipment and\nmaterials  are  scarce,  there  is  very  little  opportunity  for  practical  work.  At  the  same  time,\nvocational  education  in  schools  detracts  from  academic  competency  so  that  vocational\neducation students\u2019 abilities in science, mathematics, and English remain very low. These\ncompetencies are becoming increasingly crucial prerequisites for the preparation of skilled\nworkers. With advancing technology, workers are increasingly required to read and understand\nblueprints and instructions critical for the operation of complex and expensive machines and\ninstruments. Vocational education students are, therefore, not well prepared for the job market.\nThey are also too young to master vocational skills and at the end of their training do not have\nany employable skills and remain unemployed.\nb. Ineffective Skills Training System\n59. A major issue facing the skills training system in the RMI is that it is ineffective and\ninefficient. The interface is poor among training agencies, training providers, training authorities,\nand  the  private  sector.  The  existing  consultative  mechanism  for  the  management  and\ncoordination of skills training is ineffective. The National Training Council (NTC), established\nunder the Industries Development Act of 1991 to serve as the overall coordinating body for skills\ntraining in the RMI has not been active for lack of funds. Although NTC was mandated to\nestablish skills training standards, test trainees, and issue certificates to trained workers, it has\nyet to implement these effectively.\n60. Because  training  is  not  coordinated,  programs  are  duplicated  and  roles  of  training\nagencies overlap. There are no quality control measures for national skill standards, testing\ndesign  and  procedure,  accreditation  of  training  programs,  or  certification  of  skills.  The\nduplication  and  lack  of  articulation  and  sequencing  of  training  programs  among  training\nagencies have reduced economies of scale and increased costs of training. There is an urgent\nneed for the roles and responsibilities of training agencies such as NTC, WIB, CMI, MOE, and\nother  training  stakeholders  to  be  delineated  unequivocally.  The  Government  and  ADB\ndiscussed this issue, and the Government was asked to delineate the roles and reach an\nunderstanding  among  stakeholders  prior  to  loan  negotiations.  The  Government  has  since\nprovided written delineation of roles and responsibilities signed by all four agencies.", "14\n61. Skills training programs, carried out in the CMI skills training centers in Ebeye and\nMajuro, are relatively better designed than vocational electives. They included some practical\nwork and on-the-job skills training. But because of limited and unsuitable training facilities and of\ninsufficient equipment, instructors, training materials, and other resources, training is inefficient\nboth internally and externally. Only about 540 of the 1,620 (or 30 percent) people trained\nbetween 1994 and 1999 were employed, but most of them had to be retrained. Only 10 returned\nto school under the adult school program. The unit cost of training is also very high at about\n$4,000.\nc. Lack of Skills Training Opportunities in the Outer Islands\n62. Hardly any formal or nonformal skills training is available in the outer islands. Skills\ntraining programs such as those offered in Ebeye and Majuro are not available in any of the\nouter  islands.  Consequently,  people  in  the  outer  islands  lack  education  and  training\nopportunities. Women and the youth are particularly vulnerable in the RMI, but more so in the\nouter islands, which have only occasional ad hoc training organized by NGOs. Furthermore,\nouter islands people can not commute to a central location for training because of distance and\nfamily responsibilities.\n63.  The social impact assessment (Appendix 6) carried out by the Mission in five test sites\nin two urban centers and two outer islands revealed that the primary training needs of women in\nthe outer island are not being addressed. The needs are in areas such as improvement of food\nproduction, health and nutrition, and income generation. A community outreach program is\nneeded  for  women,  especially  for  mothers  unable  to  attend  regular  training.  The  social\nassessment revealed that the development of a community outreach program and the inclusion\nof housing units and hostels for students and teachers will help increase enrollment in skills\ntraining particularly for women. The assessment also showed that most women and out-of-\nschool youths would enroll to learn skills and would even willingly pay for the training, if they (i)\nknow about the program and its objectives; (ii) believe that the training would significantly\nincrease prospects for employment or to start a small business; (iii) are convinced the type of\ntraining is appropriate and would be of immediate use to them after training; and, (iv) are aware\nthat training will be available to those (e.g., mothers) who are unable to leave their families for\nextended periods and live in the training centers during training.\n64. Parents now believe that education and skills training would help their children and\nthemselves to secure better employment. Thus, the attitude that there are no options for young\npeople after dropping out of school is changing. Church-based women and youth organizations,\nwhich  exist  in  most  communities  in  the  urban  centers  and  in  the  outer  islands,  provide\noccasional  skills  training  for  women  and  youth.  With  some  training  and  support,  these\norganizations can play an important role in popularizing the Project and the importance of skills\ntraining. 8\n65. The assessment identified the need for a women\u2019s training, marketing, and information\ncenter (WTMIC) specifically for Majuro, to improve and market women\u2019s handicrafts. Women\nparticularly lack access to information on health, nutrition, and parenting. Consequently, they\nremain  ill-informed,  poorly  motivated,  and  lack  initiative  to  combat  health  and  nutrition\ndeficiency-related illnesses. Local resources remain unexploited while opportunities to improve\nincomes and standards of health and basic amenities of life are lost.\n                                                          \n8 Canada Fund estimated that there are around 600 such organizations in the RMI.", "15\nB. Government Policies and Plans\n66. The Government\u2019s policies on skills development are to develop a national training\nsystem  to  help  increase  the  self-reliance  of  the  Marshallese  people  and  lessen  their\ndependence on external assistance. This is to be achieved mainly through the development of a\nskills training system that will maximize the efficient use and management of the country\u2019s\nresources  and  increasing  income-generating  opportunities  for  vulnerable  groups.  The\nGovernment\u2019s skills training priorities in the next five years are (i) eliminating duplication of\ntraining effort and fostering collaboration among agencies and clients, (ii) developing an informal\ntraining mechanism to reach out to vulnerable groups in the outer islands, (iii) increasing the\nparticipation  of  the  private  sector  in  skills  training,  (iv)  providing  worker  preparation  and\nemployment placement processes, (v) training staff on a continuing basis, (vi) establishing a\nlabor market system, (vii) educating and training youth and women in particular to become\nproductive citizens and leaders of the RMI, and (viii) changing the present contract-driven\nworkforce system to a customer-driven system.\n67. The Government\u2019s strategies for improving skills training are to (i) develop an integrated,\ncoordinated,  and  efficient  skill  training  system  that  meets  the  need  for  well-trained  skilled\nworkers  for  national  economic  and  social  development;  (ii)  reform  vocational  education\nprograms in high schools to remove duplication of programs and make students more aware of\ntraining options and be more trainable with a strong foundation in basic academic skills; and (iii)\nstrengthen skills training programs to make them relevant, cost effective, and efficient.\n68. To address the weaknesses of vocational education and skills training in the country, the\nGovernment  recently  developed  a  national  skills  training  plan.  The  plan  calls  for  the\nrationalization  and  reorganization  of  skills  training  under  a  comprehensive  and  integrated\nnational skills training system with clearly defined responsibilities for training institutions, the\nprivate sector, and other stakeholders. Skills training will be coordinated and improved on a\nnational  basis  to  ensure  efficient  planning,  quality  training,  and  appropriate  delivery.  High\nschools  and  skills  training  centers  will  complement  each  other\u2019s  efforts  with  the  schools\neducating, guiding, and preparing students for eventual training in the skills training centers.\nHigh schools will cease to provide vocational education in grades 11 and 12. Instead they will\noffer, from grades 9 to 12, career awareness programs designed to introduce students to the\nwork environment and to the vocational options open to them. The career awareness program\nwill not provide any skills training but will provide career information and counseling to help\nstudents  make  informed  career  choices  in  vocational  and  occupational  areas.  The  career\norientation program will include the best elements from the current prevocational education\nprogram and the school-to-work program to avoid duplication of efforts and resources. With the\ndiscontinuance of vocational education in grades 11 and 12, high schools will have more\nresources,  time,  and  staff  to  devote  to  the  improvement  of  basic  academic  skills.  The\nanticipated enhancement of the proficiency of academic skills of students at all levels will make\nthem more trainable in skill areas and better qualified to enter postsecondary education without\nthe need for remedial education.\nC. External Assistance to the Sector\n69. External assistance to education has been mainly in the form of US federal grants. In\nrecent years, from a high of $4.5 million in 1988, the US education budget support fell to $1.9\nmillion in 1992. Since then, with education expenditure rising, the Government has assumed\ngreater responsibility for education expenditure but its funding has not sufficed to compensate", "16\nfor the reduction in US grants. As a result, total funding for education has fallen. Assistance to\nthe  sector  from  other  external  agencies  has  been  small.  Assistance  to  the  technical  and\nvocation training sector has been provided mainly from the US budgetary support to education,\nmainly from the federal funds. The Japanese government funded the new building for the MIHS\nat Rita and the equipment for the vocation training programs.\n70. ADB\u2019s first loan to the education sector, of $8.0 million for the ongoing Basic Education\nProject (footnote 1), is to raise the quality and relevancy of basic education. The project has\nbegun to address the weaknesses in elementary education. Under this project, several major\nstrides were made to improve the quality of education and to lay the foundation for continued\nand sustained improvement. The Basic Education Project has provided the country with a well-\ndeveloped and sequenced curriculum, a prerequisite for sound education, together with well\narticulated teacher\u2019s guide books. The three-year teacher training program under the Basic\nEducation Project, which replaced the two-year program in CMI, was designed to improve\nknowledge and pedagogy. The project is helping to raise the quality of teacher training. CMI has\nalso been able to renew its accreditation status with the accreditation body in the US.\n71. Another  milestone  is  the  certification  process  initiated  by  the  Teacher  Training\nCommittee set up under the project to track the large numbers of unqualified teachers and\nenforce  teacher  certification  requirements  as  stipulated  in  the  Education  Act  (1992).  The\nnational  student  evaluation  tests,  which  were  developed  and  field-tested  under  the  Basic\nEducation Project for grades 4, 6, and 8 will be implemented this year. This will further help to\nraise  educational  standards  nationwide.  The  staff  development  program  has  succeeded  in\ntraining  teachers  and  administrators  in  pedagogic  and  managerial  skills.  With  curriculum\nreforms, improvements in student evaluation and teacher training, and improved competencies\nof staff well under way, the impact of the Basic Education Project is likely to be felt in the coming\nyears. MOE has also enlisted the assistance of the Pacific Region Education Laboratory and the\nUniversity of Hawaii for the continued monitoring and revision of the curriculum to sustain its\nrelevance.\nD. Lessons Learned\n72. Only one loan, the Basic Education Project, has been provided to the education sector.\nA valuable lesson learned is the importance of decentralization in a country where islands have\nvast reaches of ocean separating them. Under the proposed Project, components and training\nactivities are spread over four strategic islands with staff to manage and oversee the activities.\nAnother lesson learned is that there is a dearth of qualified counterpart staff in the RMI and\ninternational  consultants  are  needed  in  several  areas.  Under  the  proposed  Project,  an\ninternational consultant with experience in project management will be engaged to be the\nproject manager. A consultant will be engaged to work as a project accountant. Consultants\nneed to be carefully selected as some do not want to work for extended periods in the outer\nislands or have the understanding and flexibility to modify strategies to suit local needs. The\nBasic Education Project also showed that the implementation of civil works requires a strong\nand experienced resident engineer familiar with local contract practices, and that delays are\noften  caused  by  infrequent  shipping  schedules  and  inexperienced  contractors.  Under  the\nproposed Project, an experienced engineer familiar with local conditions and customs will be\nengaged to ensure that the Project is implemented speedily. Frequent changes in administrators\nand other staff of MOE also cause changes in priorities and delays in obtaining Government\napproval  for  implementation  of  project  components.  Close  monitoring  by  the  project\nimplementation unit (PIU) and ADB is therefore important.", "17\n73. Another useful lesson learned from the Basic Education Project is the paucity of data\nand the difficulty in obtaining it, for planning, monitoring, and evaluating primary education and\n(especially) school dropouts, participation rates, proficiency levels, and teacher distribution.\nUnder the proposed Project, a management information system (MIS) and a labor market\ninformation system will be set up to collect data for better planning, monitoring, and evaluation\nof  skill  training.  Government  counterpart  funding  has  also  been  slow  in  forthcoming.\nAccordingly, the size and the implementation schedule of the Project has been adjusted to fit\nthe  Government\u2019s  budgetary  and  personnel  constraints;  specific  assurances  have  been\nobtained to ensure the timely release of counterpart funds.\n74. The change in curriculum, improved articulation, standardized testing, improved books\nand teaching aids, and teacher training, introduced under the Basic Education Project, are\nimproving the quality of education in the elementary level. As a result of teacher training, the\nquality of elementary school education delivery has improved. Although the impact on student\nperformance and dropout rate will take more time to confirm, the number of elementary school\ngraduates eligible for and seeking high school admission has increased in the last two years.\nThe actual enrollment has remained static due to lack of available seats in high school. These\ndevelopments have been factored into the design of the Project.\nE. ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n75. The main focus of ADB\u2019s operational strategy in the RMI is to help the country achieve\ngreater economic self-reliance. ADB considers that the key measure to carry out this strategy is\nthe development of human resources to support the development of the private sector and\nreduce the RMI\u2019s dependence on foreign labor to fill professional, managerial, and skilled\nworker  positions.  Fundamental  to  the  training  of  sound  personnel  in  these  areas  is  the\navailability of trainable personnel with a good basic education and a sound skills training system\nto support human resources needs. The low level of educational attainment of the labor force is\na major impediment to the development of skilled human resources. The ongoing ADB-assisted\nBasic Education Project is addressing several weaknesses in the provision of basic education\nand is expected to provide a strong foundation for the training of professional, managerial, and\nhigher skills positions.\n76. Additionally, ADB\u2019s operational strategy will focus on poverty reduction by increasing the\nincome generating capability of Marshallese women with a view to having more than one\nincome  earner  per  household.  Appropriate  dispersal  of  skills  training  facilities  across  the\narchipelago will increase access to educational benefits in the outer islands.\nF. Policy Dialogue\n77. During a policy dialogue among the Government, skills training and vocational education\nagencies,  and  ADB,  several  matters  of  concern  were  discussed,  including  the  overlap  of\nresponsibilities and functions of training agencies. The agencies agreed to cooperate with one\nanother  to  ensure  the  speedy  and  successful  implementation  of  the  Project.  Under  the\nchairmanship of the Minister of Education, the meeting clearly delineated the major role and\nresponsibilities of skills training and related agencies to avoid duplication of efforts. It was\nagreed that the role of MOE would be overall coordination, planning, and delivery of the RMI\u2019s\neducation strategy; implementation of the strategy for vocational education and skills training;\nprevocation education planning and delivery; and market-based curriculum development. The\nGovernment has subsequently confirmed that the Industries Development Act 1991 will need to", "18\nbe amended to allow the MOE to have overall responsibility for planning and coordinating skills\ntraining and vocational education in RMI. Necessary action to amend the law is being taken.\n78. WIB  will  be  responsible  for  sourcing  funds  from  US  grants  for  training  services,\ncontracting  service  providers,  paying  service  providers,  establishing  criteria  for  award  of\ncontracts, and managing one-stop centers. Training service providers will be responsible for\nproviding training, feedback, and reports to MOE, WIB, STW, NTC, and other related agencies.\nNTC\u2019s role will be to establish standards and prepare the tests at various levels of training;\nconduct skills testing and issue certificates of skills proficiency; carry out research, market\nstudies,  and  assessment  of  skills  and  vocational  needs;  assess  performance  of  service\nproviders; and collect, collate all reports from training agencies for submission to MOE. MOE\nagreed to obtain a written commitment from NTC, WIB, CMI, and MOE on their respective roles\nunder the Project.\n79. The reform of the inefficient vocational education programs in high schools, with the\nduplication of vocational education by STW programs and a large number of courses with few\nparticipants  has  also  been  the  subject  of  discussion.  The  Government  has  developed  a\ncomprehensive policy on vocational education and skills training to address this issue. As a\nresult, high school vocational education program is being replaced with a career awareness\nprogram. The issue of strengthening the understaffed Directorate of Vocational Education (DVE)\nin  MOE  to  assume  the  added  responsibilities  envisaged  was  also  taken  up  with  the\nGovernment, and MOE agreed to increase DVE\u2019s staff. The question of sustainability of the\nProject and the provision of counterpart funds was also discussed and the Government has\nassured ADB that it will provide the required recurrent expenditure funding, beginning in FY2002\nand  continuing  in  subsequent  years,  with  additional  amounts  clearly  appropriated  to  the\neducation budget for vocational education and skills training.\nIV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n80. The Government\u2019s efforts to improve the socioeconomic conditions and living standards\nof the people through economic reforms and measures are constrained by the lack of skilled\nhuman  resources.  Efforts  to  increase  employment  and  income  generating  opportunities,\nespecially  for  women  and  the  youth,  are  hampered  by  the  lack  of  training  and  income-\ngenerating opportunities especially in the outer islands. The large number of school dropouts\nwho lack employment skills flood the unemployment market each year, with attendant social\nproblems. The Government plans to provide equitable training opportunities to this unskilled\ngroup so that its members can contribute to the RMI\u2019s economic and social development.\n81. To do this, the education and vocational training must be made relevant and efficient by\nupgrading facilities and equipment, making the curriculum and programs appropriate to the\npotential employers needs, and training teachers. Students must be provided the basic literacy\nand numeracy skills they need to master the complex and sophisticated skills of modern-day\ntrade and technical occupations and to gain admission to the postsecondary level.\n82. The  Government,  to  address  the  problems  facing  vocational  education  and  skills\ntraining, has developed a new vocational education and education and skills training policy and\nplan. Under this plan, skills training will be reorganized into a comprehensive and integrated\nnational certification system. To control the quality of training, skills standards and tests will be\ndeveloped and certification introduced. The system will facilitate the vertical and horizontal", "19\nmobility of dropouts and skilled workers who will be able to improve their education and return to\nthe mainstream of education or advance to higher skill training levels. The objectives and\nresponsibilities of training agencies, the private sector, and other stakeholders will be clearly\ndefined to avoid overlap and duplication of effort and ensure greater collaboration among\ntraining  agencies.  High  schools  will  provide  career  orientation  and  leave  the  primary\nresponsibility for providing skills training and the promotion of employment opportunities for\nwomen and out-of-school youth to the nonformal education subsector.\n83.  The  Project  is  designed  to  accommodate  the  recommendations  of  the  ADB-funded\nstudy, Strategic Plan for the Ministry of Education9, and the Government\u2019s vocational education\nand skills training policy and plan. Attention was also given to the changes introduced by the\nnew Government policy on vocational education and skills training: limiting the vocational role of\nthe  high  schools  to  career  orientation  education,  concentrating  skills  training  in  nonformal\ntraining institutions, and expanding skills training opportunities to women and youth. The original\nproject objective and scope were modified accordingly.\n84. The Project aims to help the Government implement the national skills training system\nwithin the context of its national economic development plan, education strategic plan, and the\nvocational education and skills training plan. The Project is also in line with ADB\u2019s operational\nstrategy to help the RMI achieve greater economic self-reliance through the development of\ntrainable personnel with a strong foundation in basic education and sound skills. Additionally,\nthe Project follows ADB\u2019s operational strategy on poverty reduction by increasing the income\ngenerating capability of Marshallese women. Appropriate dispersal of skills training facilities\nacross the archipelago will provide increased coverage and access to educational benefits for\nvulnerable groups in the outer islands. The Project also takes into account the findings of an\nADB social assessment study (para. 131) and provides for increasing training opportunities for\nwomen and the youth.\n85. Attention has been given to cost savings in the design of the Project by taking advantage\nof existing facilities and personnel as much as possible. As NTC has moved into a new rented\nlocation, no civil works are provided. Similarly, emphasis is on upgrading existing facilities in the\nskills training centers in Ebeye and Majuro and new civil works are kept to the minimum. Some\nof the equipment from the discontinued vocational education programs will be used for the\ncareer orientation program and others will be sent to the skills training centers. Excess teachers\nfrom vocational education programs will be retrained if qualified to teach career orientation\nprograms in high schools or the approved position reassigned to skills centers for recruitment.\nCMI staff appointed under a US-funded extension program will be trained and seconded as\nmanagers to the training centers in Jaluit and Wotje. Hostels and staff housing in Jaluit and\nWotje will be used for training women and the youth from other outer islands and for high school\nstudents from remote outer islands. Sufficient attention has also been given to the training\nneeds of vulnerable people especially women. Training centers for women and the youth are\nbeing provided in four islands, and a women\u2019s training, and marketing and information center\n(WTMIC) in Majuro.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n86. The overall objective of the Project is to help the Government implement an integrated\nand articulated national skills training system. Specific objectives are to strengthen the quality of\nthe career orientation program to guide high school students appropriately in their career and\n                                                          \n9 TA 2599-RMI: Civil Service Reform Implementation, for $100,000, approved on 2 July 1996.", "20\nskills training options; improve the relevance and quality of skills training; and increase short-\nterm  employment  and  self-employment  oriented  skills  training  for  the  unemployed  and\nunderemployed in the outer islands, with a special emphasis on women and the youth. Details\nof the Project\u2019s goals and objectives and related inputs and outputs are provided in the Logical\nFramework (Appendix 7).\n87. The Project comprises four components: (i) developing a career awareness program; (ii)\nimproving skills training; (iii) enhancing skills training opportunities for women and youth; and\n(iv) institutional strengthening.\n1.  Part A: Developing a Career Awareness Program\n88. The component aims at developing a career orientation program in high schools to\nreplace  the  current  vocational  education  program  and  includes  career  orientation  and\ncounseling programs and training and counseling support.\n89. Career  Orientation  Program.  Consultants  will  develop  a  new  program  to  provide\nstudents  an  understanding  of  the  wide  range  of  occupational  skills  and  other  career\nopportunities. The program will reflect the needs of the private sector and the community and\nwill  articulate  with  programs  available  in  the  skills  training  centers.  It  will  provide  career\nawareness  among  students,  introduce  them  to  the  work  environment  and  to  careers  and\nvocational options specifically open to them, and help them, make informed career choices in\nvocational and occupational areas.\n90. Counseling  Programs.  Career  orientation  will  be  complemented  with  counseling\nprograms to provide adequate and up-to-date information on job and training opportunities to\nstudents. Students will also be introduced to simple skills, tools, and production processes to\nenable them to grasp vocational concepts, especially in relation to local knowledge, skills, and\ncustoms. This will be supplemented by visits to industry, farms, and business enterprises and\ntalks by representatives of industry and business concerns. This will give them an idea of the\ntype of skills training options open to them when they leave school and whether they have an\naptitude for such training. Career orientation programs will be closely aligned to the training\noptions  available  in  the  skills  training  centers  e.g.,  agriculture,  food  preservation,  cooking,\nsewing, gardening, fishing, construction, repair of small engines, commerce.\n91. Training and Counseling Support. A training room for conducting career orientation\nprograms and a counseling room will be constructed in each of the three public high schools.\nTraining kits in a number of training areas, teaching materials, equipment, reference materials,\nand guidebooks for teachers will also be provided. Teachers of career orientation programs will\nbe  given  in-country  and  regional  training  to  upgrade  their  technical  and  pedagogic\ncompetencies.\n2.  Part B:  Improving Skills Training\n92.  The component aims at developing an integrated skills training system and includes\none-stop centers, skills training programs, curriculum development, and skills training centers.\n93. One-Stop Centers. The Project will support WIB to construct one-stop centers in Majuro\nand Ebeye and subcenters in Jaluit and Wotje. Equipment and furniture will be provided to\nenable these centers to act as clearing and training referral centers and offer services such as\n(i) direct job referral to qualified applicants; and (ii) referral to training, counseling, academic", "21\nimprovement, or other employment readiness programs. The centers will maintain a job data\nbank of available employment opportunities including eligibility requirements, and develop a list\nof service providers whose offerings include vocational training, job-specific training, academic\nor technical training, and job readiness training.\n94. Skills Training Programs. The Project will support and upgrade skills training programs\nbeing  run  by  CMI  in  Ebeye  and  Majuro  under  WIB  and  funded  by  the  US  government.\nGenerally, three types of skills training courses will be provided in the centers: basic academic\neducation and elementary skills for school dropouts aged 14-16 years; skills and education\nenrichment development courses for school dropouts aged 16-18 years, to help them to reenter\nhigh school; and technical courses for high school graduates. Certificates will be given at the\nend of each level: the Certificate of Basic Proficiency, Certificate of Intermediate Proficiency,\nand the Certificate of Advanced Proficiency. Students will be able to upgrade their education\nand training skills at each level and will earn credits for upward or horizontal movement.\n95. Students who dropped out of high school at the eighth grade will have a second chance\nto  reenter  the  tenth  grade  by  upgrading  their  academic  proficiency.  The  three  levels  of\ncertification will be validated nationally and recognized by industry. The skills centers will also\nrun courses for retraining or upgrading skills of employees whose skills are insufficient for or not\nrelevant to the needs of industry. Special ad hoc courses will also be run in interested firms to\nencourage them to participate in the new skills training program. Better trained, more productive\nemployees will be the incentive for firms. Existing courses will be reviewed and strengthened\nand new ones introduced to meet market demand. Training in the centers will be accompanied\nby  on-the-job  training  in  an  industrial  or  commercial  establishment  through  a  collaborative\narrangement beneficial to the firm and the trainee. It will provide firms the opportunity to observe\npotential future employees. Courses will be 3-12 months depending on the type of course and\nthe entrants\u2019 qualifications and training. The centers will also conduct training programs that are\nspecially tailored to the needs of industry and the outer islands and that are not available in\nJaluit and Wotje.\n96. Curricula Development. Curricula for skills training courses will be developed with the\nhelp of consultants to be engaged under the Project. The curricula will be competency-based\nand will enable students to move at their own pace and to achieve certification at varying\nspeeds. The Project will also help establish skill standards and training modules for the major\noccupations and develop modularized training packages, based on relevant industry needs and\nthe need to increase the employability and mobility of Marshallese in the region and especially\nthe US, to which Marshallese have free access. To widen the scope of employability and\nmobility in the region and the US, training curriculum and standards will conform to the US\nDepartment  of  Labor  requirements.  To  maintain  uniformity  in  the  quality  of  training,  the\naccreditation of training programs in neighboring countries and in the US will be maintained\nthrough a review and adoption of a recognized training program of the US.\n97. Skills Training Centers. As the main skills training providers in the RMI, the two CMI\nskills training centers in Majuro and Ebeye will be rehabilitated and upgraded to provide quality\ntraining for youth, adults, school dropouts, and others. The Project will provide these centers\nwith classrooms, workshops, furniture, and equipment. In addition, consultants will be provided\nto develop curricula and training materials for new courses. Instructors of these centers will\nreceive overseas and in-country training.\n98. Youth who have dropped out of schools and those who are unemployed will have\naccess to training and education in the centers which will provide them with opportunities to", "22\nreturn to school, improve their employability, and generate income. Course offerings will focus\non their special needs in education and training. Young people interested in skills training not\navailable in Jaluit and Wotje will be sent to Ebeye or Majuro. A consultant will be engaged to\ndevelop courses and strategies to encourage dropouts to return to school or acquire employable\nor self-employable skills, and to build the self-esteem and national pride in young people.\n3.  Part C: Special Training Programs for Women and the Youth\n99. This component aims to improve income-generating opportunities of women and the\nyouth, especially in the outer islands and includes community outreach programs; training for\nwomen and the youth; and a WTMIC.\n100. Community Outreach Programs. Based on the missions\u2019 investigation, community\noutreach will be undertaken for women and dropouts in isolated and inaccessible outer islands\nto maximize the Project\u2019s poverty reduction impact. Development of gender-oriented courses\nwill encourage female enrollment (para. 144) and training on sex education, reproductive health,\nand contraception will help limit teenage pregnancies, improve women\u2019s economic prospects,\nand limit family size. Access to quality training and improved facilities will provide better career\nand  entrepreneurial  development  opportunities  for  women,  particularly  for  young  mothers.\nMoreover, skills training will benefit women and their families, as the women will be able to\nincrease food production and improve nutrition in their homes. Women\u2019s participation, through\nthe numerous groups actively working in the communities, will be encouraged through the\nprovision of training and resources to effect meaningful changes to their lives and those of their\nfamily members to benefit women in the outer islands, and special courses  will be organized,\nmainly in agriculture (farming, poultry rearing, and pig rearing); fisheries (aquaculture); family-\nrelated skills (childcare, sewing, cooking, gardening, nutrition, traditional medicine, reproductive\nhealth,  management  of  households,  and  small  business  finance);  income  generation\n(handicraft, small business management, and marketing); traditional skills (canoe building);\nvalues formation (parenting and teaching skills, and gender training); and leadership training.\n101. Special  emphasis  will  be  given  to  the  encouragement  and  promotion  of  handicraft\nactivities, and development of entrepreneurial, marketing, management, and small business\nskills for self-employment. Small business development will be incorporated to increase self-\nemployment prospects. Skills training courses proven successful when the Women\u2019s Division\nwas active (e.g., sewing machine repair skills, dressmaking, and tailoring), will be conducted.\nBasic tools and materials (e.g., sewing kits and machines) will be provided to participants after\ntraining to ensure that skills learned are available for personal or commercial use. Island fairs\nand exhibitions will be organized to disseminate and collect information from communities on\nisland business or cottage industry opportunities that could be developed. Workshops will be\nheld  on  managing  handicraft  courses,  tapping  overseas  markets  for  local  products,  and\npreparing catalogues for distribution to potential buyers. A consultant will be engaged to develop\na strategic plan and programs for the training of women.\n102. Implementation of the community outreach programs will begin with a pilot program of\nselected islands. Following an evaluation of the pilot program, the implementation strategy will\nbe reviewed and revised if necessary. Jaluit and Wotje islands will be used as the pilot areas for\nthe first year of the Project before moving into more remote islands. Itinerant trainers and\ncommunity members will conduct needs assessments and training activities in selected areas.\nTrainers familiar with local customs and situations will be engaged to encourage participation\namong women and the youth. The selection of other pilot areas will be based on the level of\ncommunity organization, interest, and preparedness. This participatory approach is designed to", "23\nmaximize project impact and sustainability. Project implementation progress will be monitored\nby quarterly and annual assessments from feedback from high schools, skills training centers,\nand the special centers for women and the youth in Wotje and Jaluit. Teachers, instructors, and\ncommunity members in Ebeye, Jaluit, Majuro, and Wotje will be engaged to reach out to outer\nand remote islands where they will conduct the community outreach programs, short training\ncourses, and demonstrations for women and the youth in these and neighboring islands.\n103. Training Units for Women and the Youth. The Project will support the construction of\nspecial training units in Jaluit and Wotje to conduct training, demonstrations, discussions, and\nseminars to develop self-employment and small-scale business opportunities in each one-stop\ncenter and subcenter to provide training and organize related programs. In addition, a hostel for\nmale  students  and  another  for  female  students  together  with  staff  housing  units  will  be\nconstructed in Jaluit and Wotje to house and train women and youth and instructors from other\nislands. A proactive public information campaign via the radio, found to be the most effective\nway of disseminating information in outer islands and urban centers, will be mounted to create\nawareness  of  course  offerings,  roles  of  one-stop  subcenters  and  training  centers,  and\navailability  of  community  outreach  programs.  Equipment  such  as  sewing  machines,\nrefrigerators,  ovens,  visual  aids,  cameras,  video  recorders,  computers,  and  radios  will  be\nprovided to support training programs. About 400 women and youths will be trained yearly in the\nfour training units.\n104. The training units will be run by CMI, which will appoint extension teachers as managers\nof these training units in Jaluit and Wotje. The manager will (i) be responsible for assessing\ntraining requirements; organizing training; and selecting instructors, trainers, and demonstrators\nfrom the community, CMI, and other relevant institutions; (ii) develop a strategic plan for training\nwomen and the youth; (iii) manage, monitor, and evaluate the programs; and (iv) organize the\noutreach program with the extension teacher. Training will be provided following an assessment\nof employment and self-employment opportunities in the outer islands and will be aligned to\nlocal, traditional, and rural resources. Consultant services will be provided to help the manager\ndevelop the strategic training plan and programs.\n105. Women\u2019s Training, Marketing, and Information Center. In Majuro, WTMIC will be\nconstructed to help NGOs (including church organizations) provide training to women and\nexhibit their handicrafts for sale. The WTMIC will provide a permanent site for training and for\ndisplay and sale of articles produced by women. This will also provide opportunities for women\nto learn small business skills and eliminate the services of middlemen in marketing their wares.\nThe WTMIC will be a meeting place where women can interact, share experiences, and work\ntogether to resolve common problems. The WTMIC will also provide information exchange and\ncoordination with regional information centers. The WTMIC will be managed by the Women\u2019s\nDivision in the Ministry of Internal Affairs.\n4. Part D: Institutional Capacity Building:\n106. This component will strengthen institutional capacity to plan, regulate, and manage an\nefficient  skills  training  system,  and  includes  monitoring  systems,  staff  development,  and\nresearch and studies.\n107. Monitoring  Systems.  To  strengthen  the  planning,  monitoring,  and  evaluation\ncapabilities of training agencies, appropriate mechanisms will be set up and existing ones\nstrengthened. A computer-based monitoring and information system will be set up and a benefit\nmonitoring system will be developed and institutionalized and performance indicators specified.", "24\nAppropriate software will be developed, tested, and installed by a consultant who will also\nprepare manuals on MIS and conduct training programs. A labor market research system will be\nestablished for research and studies on selected issue-oriented topics such as tracer studies,\nlabor market trends, employment and self-employment opportunities in the outer islands, and\nhuman resources needs. Information and data gathered will be used to determine programs and\ntraining to be provided. NTC will also collect data for analysis, processing, and preparation of\nreports for the Government and ADB.\n108. Staff Development. The Project will support the training, upgrading, and retraining of\nskills  training  and  vocational  training  planners  and  administrators  and  others  from  training\nagencies, CMI, MOE, NTC, and WIB. The staff skills will be upgraded through local, regional,\nand international training in managerial, entrepreneurial, technical, and other skills.\n109. Research  and  Studies.  Research  and  studies  will  include  (i)  a  tracer  study  of\ngraduates of training agencies, (ii) outer island skills training needs, (iii) student aptitudes and\nmotivation, (iv) employment and self-employment generation, and (v) traditional and rural skills.\nThe Project will also initiate public awareness campaigns to promote skills training and to\nmarket the trainees to the employers.\nC. Cost Estimates\n110. The total cost of the Project, including taxes and duties and interest during the project\nlife, is estimated at $9.1 million equivalent, including $6.7 million in foreign exchange and $2.4\nmillion equivalent in local currency costs. The cost estimates are summarized in Table 1.\nDetailed cost estimates are given in Appendix 8.\nTable 1: Cost Estimates\n($million)\nProject Activity Foreign Cost Local Currency Total Cost\nA.

Financing Plan\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($million)\nSource Foreign Local Financing\nCurrency Currency Total Percentage\nADB 6.700 0.125 6.825 75.0\nGovernment 0.000 2.275 2.275 25.0\nTotal 6.700 2.400 9.100 100.0\n111. The Government requested ADB for a $6.825 million loan, corresponding to 75 percent\nof the project cost, from ADB's Special Funds resources to finance the entire foreign exchange\ncost of $6.700 million and $0.125 million of the local costs. The Government will provide $2.275\nmillion as counterpart funding to finance the major portion of the local cost of $2.400 million\nequivalent. Table 2 summarizes the financing plan. This Government\u2019s share will be spread\nover the four-year implementation period of the loan and has been so designed to provide a\nlower rate of disbursement during the first two years in view of the Government's current funding\nconstraints. Due to changes in project design requested by the Government, the total cost of the\nProject is higher than estimated at the time of the fact-finding mission. The revised project\ndesign significantly supports the development objective of poverty alleviation among the poorest\npeople in the outer islands. Further, as an outcome of the social assessment, specific outreach\nprograms, and the WTMIC have been added.\n112. The RMI has been having an economic downturn for the past four years. The downturn\nis partly induced by the reform program initiated in 1995 under ADB\u2019s Public Sector Reform\nProgram loan. Contraction in the RMI\u2019s public sector dominated economy was anticipated as\nresult of drastic reforms, which include a significant reduction in Government expenditures and\ndownsizing of civil service. Consequently, the Government will continue to face serious fiscal\nproblems until the economy is able to consolidate the gains from the reform measures currently\nin place. The FY2001 budget bill presented to the Parliament for approval shows a deficit of\n$4.2 million. This is primarily due to a shortfall in tax revenues, which is due to the lowering of\nthe tax rate and is aggravated by the substantial past due obligation in the health sector that has\nremained  unpaid  since  the  previous  Government.  The  recent  fuel  price  increase  is  also\nexpected to adversely affect the FY2001 budget deficit through increased subsidies for outer\nisland utilities and other expenditures driven by fuel prices. The fiscal situation is expected to\nimprove once the Government\u2019s debt obligation is settled in FY2002. Due to these special\ncircumstances the cost sharing has been modified to 75:25. The modification is in accordance\nwith the provision for flexibility in the ceiling for ADB financing, under ADB\u2019s graduation policy.10\nThe World Bank usually finances up to 80 percent of similar projects in the Pacific region.\n113. The proposed ADB loan will have a payment period of 32 years, including a grace period\nof 8 years, with a 1.0 percent interest charge during the grace period and 1.5 percent thereafter.\n114. Incremental recurrent costs as a result of the Project will not be significant as the\nadditional teachers and staff needed by institutions will come from the staff currently teaching\nvocational education programs in high schools. Additional staff will be funded from US federal\nland grants, extension teachers at CMI, and reassignment of approved but unfilled teaching and\n                                                          \n10R204-98: Graduation Policy for the Bank\u2019s DMCs, 23 November.", "26\nadministrative posts in schools. NTC has moved to new spacious offices sufficient to carry out\nits many responsibilities using its own operating funds. Accordingly, the yearly incremental\nrecurrent cost is estimated to be $205,000 starting from FY2002 (Table 3). The Government\nconfirmed that this level of increase can be supported from FY2002 and will be specifically\nprovided for in the annual budget.\nTable 3: Recurrent Cost\n($)\nItem Cost\nAdministrators, Teachers, and Instructors 58,000\nCommunications 15,000\nRental of Premises 25,000\nPublic Utilities 20,000\nMaintenance of Facilities 22,000\nTravel in the RMI 30,000\nConsumables 35,000\nTotal 205,000\nSource: Staff estimates.\nE. Executing Agency\n \n115. The Executing Agency for the Project will be MOE, which will also be the Implementing\nAgency for all project activities. The Minister of Education or his representative will have overall\nresponsibility for planning, organizing, and implementing of the Project and will liaise closely\nwith all other Government departments and the private sector. MOE will be responsible for the\noverall coordination and implementation of the Project and in accordance with established\nGovernment procedures, will be the official contact point for ADB. A project steering committee\n(PSC) will be established to provide policy guidance on project issues; be responsible for the\noverall  implementation  of  the  Project;  and  oversee  project  planning,  organization,\nimplementation, and monitoring. The PSC, which will meet at least once every quarter, will be\nchaired by the Minister of Education and members will include senior representatives of MOE,\nNTC, WIB, CMI, Directorate of Vocational Education of MOE, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of\nthe Internal Affairs, Chamber of Commerce, and the private sector. A representative from the\nWomen\u2019s Division of the Ministry of Internal Affairs will be a PSC member and the focal point for\nsupport and assistance to women. The PSC will be assisted by the PIU manager.\nF. Implementation Arrangements\n1.  Project Implementation Unit\n116. The PIU, to be located in MOE, will be responsible for the day-to-day administration and\nimplementation of the Project and liaison with ADB. The PIU will procure goods and services\nneeded for the implementation of all the components, subcomponents, and activities of the\nProject. PIU will be headed by a full-time project manager who will report to the Secretary of\nEducation. The project manager will be appointed in consultation with ADB. The PIU will be\nstaffed by a full-time accountant and a secretary and supported by an engineer to provide\nengineering services as and when required. The PIU will meet the members of NTC, WIB, and\nservice providers from time to time to resolve any project implementation issues and other", "27\nrelated matters. Local counterpart staff will support the project implementation monitoring in the\nouter islands. The project management organization chart is in Appendix 9.\n2. Schedule\n117. The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  four  years  with  commencement\nexpected in the first quarter of 2001 and completion in 2004 (Appendix 10).\n3. Procurement of Goods and Services\n118. The Mission held extensive discussions with Government officials and MOE staff to brief\nthem on ADB\u2019s procurement procedures. All procurement of goods and services financed by\nADB will be carried out in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. Contracts for the\npurchase of equipment estimated to cost more than $500,000 and civil works estimated to cost\nmore than $1.0 million will be carried out using international competitive bidding procedures.\nInternational shopping procedures will be followed for purchase of equipment between $100,000\nand $500,000. Civil works contracts estimated to cost $1.0 million or less will be awarded in\naccordance with local competitive bidding procedures which have been examined and found to\nbe consistent with ADB guidelines. For contracts to be awarded on the basis of local competitive\nbidding, the bidding documents will specify eligibility criteria for bidders. Smaller purchases\nestimated to cost less than $100,000 will be carried out through direct purchase procedures.\nAppendix 11 lists the procurement packages.\n119. The main Project inputs will be as follows:\n(i)  Civil works will be provided to construct or upgrade classrooms, workshops, one-\nstop centers, training centers, a WTMIC, hostels, and staff housing units.\n(ii)  Training equipment and furniture will be provided for one-stop centers, training\ncenters, high schools, and WTMIC. Reference and instructional materials for\ntraining will also be provided.\n(iii)  Consultant services will be provided in a number of areas (para. 120).\n(iv)  The staff development program will comprise in-country training for 50 teachers,\ninstructors, and administrators and 10 overseas/regional fellowships to improve\nthe competencies of staff, increase the quality and effectiveness of training, and\nenhance  occupational  and  training  skills  and  technical  knowledge.  Excess\nteachers from vocational education programs will be retrained to teach career\norientation programs in high schools or as instructors in skills centers. Excess\nCMI staff will also be trained as mangers of the training centers in Jaluit and\nWotje.\n(v)  Research projects and studies will be carried out on dropouts, graduates of\ntraining  agencies,  outer  island  skills  training  needs,  student  aptitudes  and\nmotivation,  employment  and  self-employment  generation,  and  traditional  and\nrural skills.", "28\n4. Consulting Services\n120. Approximately 75 person-months of internationally recruited and 90 person-months of\ndomestically  recruited  consulting  services  will  be  provided  in  areas  including  curriculum\ndevelopment,  materials  design,  development  of  skills  standards,  testing  and  certification,\nresearch,  career  guidance  and  counseling,  and  project  implementation.  The  project\nimplementation support for the first three years, including project, financial, and accounting\nmanagement, will be provided as well as support for architectural and civil engineering design\nand  supervision.  The  Project  will  provide  consultant  services  for  setting  up  the  PIU.  An\ninternationally recruited project manager will be responsible for the day-to-day implementation\nof the Project. A counterpart manager will be trained to take over in year four of the Project. In\naddition, an engineer will be provided to oversee and manage civil works and an accountant to\nmaintain project accounts. All consultants to be financed by ADB will be engaged in accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB\non the engagement of domestic consultants. All consultants will provide essential service and\noperational support and build capacity in the local institutions and conduct training and staff\nsupport. Appendix 12 presents the outline terms of reference of the consultants.\n5. Resettlement and Land Issues\n121. No  resettlement  issues  are  involved  in  implementing  the  Project.  The  Government\nadvised ADB that at most locations involving civil works the land rights have already been\nsecured by the Government. However, the location for the WTMIC in Majuro is yet to be\nselected, and land use rights will need to be obtained. The Government has assured ADB that\nno resettlement will be involved. If a significant change occurs in the land use, an appropriate\nland acquisition plan will be provided to ADB prior to implementation of the component.\n6. Disbursements and Imprest Account\n122. To  facilitate  project  implementation  and  ensure  timely  release  of  funds,  an  imprest\naccount will be established for the Project. The amount to be deposited will be based on\nanticipated  expenditures  to  be  incurred  for  a  3-6  month  period.  The  imprest  fund  will  be\nestablished,  operated,  and  maintained  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan  Disbursement\nHandbook. ADB's statement of expenditure (SOE) procedures may be used for reimbursement\nof expenditures and for liquidation or replenishment of each expenditure paid out of the imprest\naccount that does not exceed the equivalent of $50,000. After the initial deposit, the account will\nbe simultaneously liquidated and replenished on a regular basis to ensure that sufficient funds\nare always available.\n123. All applications for withdrawal and disbursement of loan funds will be submitted to ADB\nthrough the Ministry of Finance. The Government will establish a separate imprest account for\ncounterpart funds and deposit at least $75,000 to ensure availability of counterpart funding at\nthe commencement of the Project. The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed in line with ADB\u2019s\nLoan Disbursement Handbook.\n7. Reporting Requirements\n124. The PIU will develop and implement an action plan agreed to between ADB and the\nGovernment for carrying out project activities in accordance with the timetable agreed therein.\nThe PIU, in consultation with ADB, will review the action plan and revise it as necessary. Based\non the action plan, the PIU will prepare and submit to ADB quarterly progress reports, in an", "29\nacceptable format. Reports will be submitted to ADB not later than 30 days after the end of the\nperiod covered by the report and will indicate, among other things, (i) progress made against\nestablished targets, including quality aspects; (ii) delays and problems encountered and actions\ntaken or proposed to resolve problems; (iii) compliance with loan covenants; and (iv) proposed\nprograms of activities to be undertaken and progress expected during the next three months.\nThe focus will normally be on routine project monitoring and on output indicators from the\nproject MIS. In addition, the Government will prepare a project completion report no later than\nthree months following the Project\u2019s physical completion. The PIU will submit to ADB copies of\nall reports produced by the project consultants.\n8. Accounting and Auditing\n125. The Government will establish and maintain consistent records and accounts adequate\nto identify goods and services financed from the proceeds of the loan. The PIU will (i) maintain\nseparate accounts for the Project; (ii) ensure that accounts and related financial statements are\naudited annually in accordance with sound auditing principles by auditors acceptable to ADB;\nand (iii) submit to ADB, not later than 9 months after the close of each fiscal year, certified\ncopies of the audited accounts and the report of the auditor. A provision of $50,000 has been\nmade in the Project, to be funded under the loan, for preparing the Project\u2019s annual audited\nreports. These funds can be used to contract out auditing work and for Project-related costs of\nthe Auditor General\u2019s Office. The annual audit will include the audit of the imprest account and\nSOE and a separate audit opinion on the use of the imprest account and SOE should be\nincluded in the annual audit report.\n9. Project Performance Monitoring\n126. Because of the importance of the Project, ADB will devote special attention to guiding,\nmonitoring, and evaluating project performance. ADB will review project implementation through\nquarterly reports and regular review missions. The PIU will establish a project performance and\nmonitoring system (PPMS), further detailing the qualitative and quantitative indicators specified\nin the framework in order to measure, assess, and monitor project outputs and impact in terms\nof skills training efficiency improvements, enhanced quality of career orientation programs,\nincreased employment opportunities for women and the youth, lowered dropout rates, increased\nreentrants to grade 10, enhanced academic proficiency of CMI entrants, improved institutional\ncapabilities, and improved equity. Project monitoring procedures will be refined and agreed with\nADB. The PPMS will be an integral part of MOE\u2019s MIS to ensure continued monitoring and\nevaluation of project performance after completion. To measure project performance during\nproject implementation and operation, the PPMS will use a set of objectively verifiable indicators\nspecified in the project framework. Baseline or benchmark values will be determined at the\nbeginning  of  the  implementation  period.  Qualitative  and  quantitative  information  on  the\nobjectively verifiable indicators will be collected periodically, e.g., annually for most efficiency\nand equity indicators, and segregated by gender. Project outputs and development impacts will\nbe evaluated annually and monitored frequently by the PIU.\n127.  In developing and implementing the PPMS, special focus will be given to the needs of\nwomen and the youth. Using the equity-related performance indicators given in the project\nframework as a basis, the PPMS will identify a specific subset of indicators to assess the\nProject\u2019s impact on equity by gender and by location of islands. Particular focus will be given to\npoverty alleviation and income generation.", "30\n10. Midterm Review\n128. A comprehensive midterm review of the Project will be undertaken by the Government\nand ADB at about the end of the second year of project implementation. Using the PPMS and\nother measures, the review will assess the progress and achievements of the Project against its\nobjectives, identify problems being encountered, and recommend remedial action if needed.\n11. Advance Action and Retroactive Financing\n129. ADB has approved the Government\u2019s request for advance action for the recruitment of\nconsultants and the procurement of goods and services relating to the early establishment of\nthe PIU. ADB has approved $100,000 for retroactive financing of expenditures for establishment\nof the PIU and related implementation support incurred after loan approval and prior to loan\neffectiveness. Advance procurement and consultant recruitment action will be undertaken in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and  other  arrangements\nsatisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants  and  Guidelines  for\nProcurement. The Government was informed that ADB\u2019s concurrence with advance action and\nretroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the Project or any part of it.\nG. Environmental and Social Measures\n1.  Environment\n130. Environmental implications of the project were reviewed and no adverse impacts were\nidentified.  The  Project  will  ensure  that  the  siting,  design,  construction,  rehabilitation  and\noperations of the training units to be established under the Project will follow the Government\u2019s\nenvironmental  requirements,  ADB\u2019s  Environmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure\nDevelopment Projects, and other relevant guidelines. Environmental monitoring of the Project\nwill  be  reported  through  the  progress  reports  to  be  submitted  to  ADB.  In  the  course  of\ncurriculum development, the importance of environment management and protection will be\nemphasized  so  that  trainees  understand  the  impact  of  industrial  growth  on  the  long-term\nprospect of the country\u2019s environment.\n2. Social Measures\n131. Based  on  the  primary  analysis  carried  out  for  the  social  impact  assessment,  the\nfollowing recommendations were incorporated into the project design.\n(i)  a community outreach program to focus on women and dropouts particularly in\nisolated  and  inaccessible  outer  islands,  to  increase  coverage  and  maximize\npoverty reduction impact;\n(ii)  courses  on  income  generating  skills,  food  production,  gender,  reproductive\nhealth, and nutrition, to be designed after consultation with NGOs and beneficiary\ngroups;\n(iii)  participation of church-based organizations and NGOs, to be encouraged during\nimplementation and evaluation, to effectively deliver the Project, maximize its\nresources, and increase project sustainability;", "31\n(iv)  the WTMIC in Majuro (para. 105), to increase training for women\u2019s groups and\npromote handicraft production;\n(v)  an  intensive  public  information  and  education  campaign  targeting  women,\ndropouts,  vocational  training  students,  and  skilled  workers,  to  encourage\nincreased enrollment at the training centers and in the outreach programs; and\n(vi)  a gender specialist, to ensure that women\u2019s needs are properly reflected in the\ndesign of training courses and on the mode of delivery.\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA. Economic Analysis\n1. Economic Benefits\n132. Increased employment and self employment opportunities will contribute to improved\nearnings and reduction in poverty. With increased awareness of the benefits of skills and\nentrepreneurial training through fairs, exhibitions, and publicity awareness campaigns, local\ncommunity  members  will  be  motivated  to  experiment  with,  for  example,  farming,  animal\nhusbandry, fish management, and processing, to augment their incomes. The construction of\ndormitories for students in Ebeye, Jaluit, and Wotje skill centers will help attract students from\nremote islands. Increased economic activity will be promoted by the establishment of one-stop\ncenters in the outer islands.\n2. Project Benefits\n133. Better-trained skilled workers from an improved and articulated delivery system with\nupgraded training facilities, instructors, curriculum, skill standards, and certification will provide\nskilled  workers  for  industry  and  the  private  sector.  At  the  same  time,  income  generating\nmechanisms will be provided and incomes of vulnerable groups especially women, will be\nenhanced and will have beneficial effects on health and quality of life. The number of school\ndropouts will be reduced and their wasted potential harnessed through skills training centers\nand education enhancement programs.\n134. The integrated and certification system of training will allow for greater articulation within\nthe training sector and afford trainees opportunities for horizontal and vertical mobility within the\ntraining system. The dropout problem and attendant social ills will be reduced. The benefits of a\nrationalized and integrated national system will be reflected in improved quality and relevance of\ntraining and the qualitative expansion of the skilled worker pool. The private sector will have a\nwider choice of qualified workers with consequent gain in productivity.\n135. Coordinated and integrated training will increase trainee enrolment and the sharing of\nfacilities and other resources among training agencies will result in more cost effective delivery.\nThe efficiency of management too will improve. With NTC taking the pivotal advisory and\nregulatory role, an articulated curriculum will emerge. This together with better-trained teachers\nand managers, upgraded workshops, equipment, standardized tests, certification, and curricula\nrelevant to labor market needs will significantly improve the quality of training. The employability\nand mobility of trained workers in the region and to the US will be enhanced with the close\nalignment of the curriculum with that of the US. The introduction of the career awareness", "32\nprogram in high schools will motivate and inculcate appropriate attitudes in students seeking\nskills training.\n3. Affordability and Sustainability\n136. Sustainability of skills training courses is not expected to pose a major problem if the\nCompact funds are renewed. In the unlikely event that Compact is not renewed, MOE has, from\nthe general fund, budgeted for an increased expenditure for all items, including vocational\neducation and skills training, starting from FY2000. NTC\u2019s revenue from the levy on foreign\nworkers is likely to be maintained until skilled workers under the Project are trained. The\nGovernment is also currently negotiating with UNDP for additional funds. Vocational programs\nare not being expanded, and will be reformed, streamlined, and reduced. The present recurrent\ncosts provided by MOE should be adequate. CMI is the main focus in the skill delivery system,\nand is concentrating on rationalization and consolidation of inefficient and costly programs.\nCMI\u2019s revenues from tuition fees are likely to increase with the projected increase in enrollment.\nCMI\u2019s Endowment Trust Fund will provide a buffer and some measures of self-sufficiency in the\nnear future. WIA is expected to receive about $840,000 for its programs in the current and\nsubsequent years. This will be adequate in view of the expected decline in unit costs of training\nas a result of the internal efficiency measures to be introduced under the Project. Even without\nCompact funding, the Government is committed to ensuring adequate funding for vocational\neducation and skills training.\n137. CMI\u2019s annual recurrent costs, not covered by WIA, are estimated at $508,800 while Pell\ngrants for tuition fees are expected to total about $421,344. The shortfall of about $90,000 will\nbe met by donations and from the Endowment Fund and carry-over funds. These expected\namounts will be adequate to maintain current programs. The incremental cost as result of\nimplementing the Project is estimated at $205,000. The Government considers that it can afford\nthis cost and has assured ADB that adequate provision will be made in the annual budget .\nB. Social Dimensions\n1. Poverty Dimensions\n138. In  the  RMI,  disadvantaged  groups  are  present  in  the  urban  centers  and  the  outer\nislands. Although the Government has yet to establish a poverty line or indicators for poverty,\nthe RMI\u2019s disadvantaged groups clearly include isolated islander households without trust fund\nearnings, remittances, or other sources of income; people who cannot afford to pay for their\nchildren\u2019s public schooling and medical needs, and who continue to depend solely on limited\nGovernment-supported schools and hospitals; and migrant families (i.e., migrant within the RMI)\nwho  are  landless,  with  no  member  of  the  household  employed.  Migrant  households  are\ncommon  because  of  the  huge  displacements  resulting  from  nuclear  and  missile  testing\n(Kwajalein) and the Second World War. This has led to dispossession, landlessness, and\nfeelings of powerlessness, which perpetuate poverty. The migrants include people from Bikini,\nEnewetak, Rongelap, Utirik, and around Kwajelein atolls.\n139. The  1999  population  census  shows  total  unemployment  at  30.9  percent  with  an\nunemployment  rate  of  females  (37.3  percent)  significantly  higher  than  that  of  males  (27.6\npercent). According to recent UNDP statistics, unemployment of urban youth is estimated at 50\npercent.11 In conjunction with such high rates of unemployment is the large disparity in income\n                                                          \n11 Pacific Human Development Report, 1999, UNDP.", "33\nlevels between islands. The mean annual household income varies greatly with atolls, with\nincome in Kwajalein approaching $14,000 due to the US military establishment, Enewetak over\n$10,000 due to nuclear payments, the main urban center of Majuro, at $8,000; while in the rest\nof the atolls it is under $2,000. To alleviate poverty, the Project will have to address the needs of\nthe unemployed, the lower income outer island atolls, and significantly disadvantaged women.\n140. The ADB intervention must be considered in the context of resource constraints as well\nas the RMI\u2019s remoteness, isolation, and lack of comparative advantage or economies of scale.\n2. Social Dimensions and Impact on Poverty\n141. The findings of the social assessment study carried out by the Mission have been built\ninto the Project (para. 131).\n142. The Project will provide skills and training opportunities for about 800 urban and outer\nisland unemployed women and 600 youths from low-income families. The direct benefits to the\nfamilies of the 1,400 trainees will improve the lives of about 11,000 people (approximately 20\npercent of the current population). The outer islands, which are isolated from the capital, will\nhave  increased  participation  in  income  generating  activities  through  (i)  improved  skills  in\nagriculture and fishing technologies for subsistence, and (ii) knowledge about activity in local\nand national produce markets. Employers will have an improved supply of local skilled workers,\neffectively reducing the need to recruit overseas workers. The outer islands economies will\nbenefit  from  the  infusion  of  new  skills  and  trained  people,  leading  to  job  creation  from\nentrepreneurial  ventures.  Families  will  directly  benefit  from  the  newly  acquired  skills  in\nhousehold management, resulting in improved nutrition.\n143. The  Project  also  promote  self-reliance  and  empowerment  among  beneficiaries.  For\ntrainees who become employable, this will mean increased financial independence and freedom\nfrom chronic dependency on families. With the right skills and confidence gained from the\ntraining and work experience, especially in the Majuro WTMIC, trainees will be more prepared\nto find paid employment or start their own microenterprises.\n3.  Gender and Development\n \n144. Development of gender-oriented courses will encourage female enrollment leading to\nemployment in areas where female participation has been traditionally low. Also, access to\nquality training and improved facilities under the Project will open opportunities for career and\nentrepreneurial development for women. Skills training will benefit women and their families in\nthe form of increased food production and improved nutrition. The Project will encourage active\nparticipation of existing community-based organizations and NGOs, particularly those that serve\nwomen, to ensure effective and sustained implementation of the outreach program for the outer\nislands.\n145. The social assessment (appendix 6) revealed that women especially in the outer islands\nare unable to attend regular classes at a central location. Accordingly, a separate community\noutreach program was included in the project design. Through the program, extension staff will\norganize training at the community level at locations closer to the clients. This will significantly\nincrease coverage of the training and easier access to the program for women in the outer\nislands.", "34\n4.  Beneficiaries\n146. The direct beneficiaries of the Project, given the RMI\u2019s small population, will be relatively\nsignificant. The 1,200 high school students in public schools and 1,380 in private schools in\ngrades 9-12 will benefit from the career awareness program.\n147. The next group of immediate beneficiaries will be the 464 participants who will receive\ntraining, retraining or upgrading training in the skills centers in Ebeye and Majuro over the\nproject period. Some of them will find employment locally, taking over from foreign workers.\n148. A third group of beneficiaries will be mainly from low-income and other disadvantaged\ngroups.  These  people  primarily  include  women  (all  ages),  and  young  unemployed  and\nunderemployed males in the urban centers and in the outer islands with limited opportunities for\nformal employment and no access to land or other sources of income. At least 500 women will\nbenefit from the educational, skills, and entrepreneurial training and outreach programs annually\nunder the Project. They will include women who have left or have not yet entered the labor\nforce, and those who have spent their adult lives engaged solely in subsistence farming or\nfishing. To ensure equitable access for women, not less than half of all course offerings will be\ntargeted at women, although courses are expected to be available to both genders.\n149. Elimination of vocational education from the high schools will allow more time for basic\neducation and strengthens the Government\u2019s objective to improve the academic content and\ncompetency at the secondary level. As designed, the Project incorporates this strategy and is\nexpected to produce significant improvement in the competency of students at the secondary\nand tertiary levels. Cost savings from eliminating vocational education at the secondary level will\nbe used to improve delivery of training service. A wider cross-section of the scattered population\nwill be covered more efficiently.\n150. The project design also incorporates a flexible mechanism to allow secondary school\ndropouts to reenter the academic stream through the certification process. The curriculum for\nskills training will be developed so as to augment the academic aspect of learning throughout\nnonformal skills training. This is also required because of the increasing need for the higher\nacademic proficiency required in several of the fields of skills training.\n151. Another group of beneficiaries will be the youth, including dropouts, particularly those\nfrom the outer islands. At least 100 are expected to enroll in the education enhancement\nprogram and at least 20 will reenter grade 10 in high school. Another 150 will have access to\nskills training in the training centers.\nC. Project Risks\n152. A  number  of  risks  that  may  adversely  affect  the  project  implementation  and  the\nachievement of project objectives have been identified.\n153. Availability of Counterpart Funds. With the impending review of Compact funding, the\nGovernment  is  likely  to  face  constraints  in  mobilizing  the  increased  additional  education\nexpenditure anticipated. However, the Government has assured ADB that the needed funds will\nbe provided (para. 158 [v]).\n154. Availability of Teachers. Well-trained teachers and instructors for the new vocation and\nskills curricula will not be readily available. The Project will address this problem through the", "35\nstaff development program whereby sufficient numbers of teachers and administrators will be\ntrained overseas and in the country. The Project is also supporting the establishment in CMI of\nan instructor training program to train instructors in selected skills areas. In addition, in-service\ntraining for vocational teachers and instructors will be conducted under the Project.\n155. Inadequate Experience in Project Implementation. MOE staff have experience in\nimplementing only one externally-assisted project: ADB\u2019s Basic Education Project (footnote 1).\nTherefore, the project manager of the Basic Education Project may be engaged to manage the\nProject after completion of his present assignment in November 2000. Arrangements have been\nmade with MOE to retain some of the counterpart staff, trained under the Basic Education\nProject,  to  manage  the  Project.  Special  training  will  be  given  to  PIU  staff  in  project\nimplementation. Recently, MOE has transferred an expert administrator from CMI to MOE. This\nis expected to strengthen MOE\u2019s ability to implement the diverse components of the Project\neffectively.\n156. Employment of Graduates. The employment of trained workers may be a constraint\nunless  the  job  market  improves,  as  is  anticipated  with  several  measures  planned  by  the\nGovernment. Under the Project, several strategies are expected to increase self-employment.\nFishing and agriculture courses planned in the skills centers in Jaluit and Wotje will help\ngenerate interest in self-employment in these areas. Large amounts of vegetables, pigs, and\npoultry are imported, and much of this could be produced in the RMI. In-shore fishing and the\nuse of coastal resources also present self-employment and income generating opportunities.\n157. Loss  of  Trained  Marshallese.  With  Marshalles  having  free  access  to  the  US,\nMarshallese trained under the Project could leave the RMI. This risk could be contained if\nadequate  employment  opportunities  are  created  in  the  RMI  and  the  economic  situation\nimproves. Migration is not a total loss as most Marshallese remit money home. Eventually,\nsome return to the RMI, bringing valuable training skills acquired abroad.\nVI.  ASSURANCES\nA. Specific Assurances\n158. The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which will be incorporated in the loan covenants.\n(i)  The Government will provide adequate staff for NTC and the Department of\nVocational  Education  of  MOE,  to  enable  them  to  efficiently  carry  out  their\nmandates.\n(ii)  The Government will ensure that school-to-work programs and funds received\nunder the WIA shall be made available to NTC to carry out preliminary research\nand needs assessment work in order to assist the curriculum consultant to be\nprovided under Part A of the Project develop appropriate course outlines.\n(iii)  The Government will make available to skills training institutions the teachers\nmade  redundant  by  the  closure  of  the  high  school  vocational  education\nprograms. Extension teachers from CMI will also be seconded to all the skills\ntraining centers.", "36\n(iv)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  implementation  of  the  Project  and  the\nresulting benefits are monitored and evaluated on an annual basis. Within three\nmonths of loan effectiveness, the Government will have the PIU establish a\nPPMS based on specified performance indicators.\n(v)  The Government will ensure that the counterpart funding required for timely and\neffective project implementation will be separately provided in the annual budget\nfor each fiscal year.\n(vi)  The  Government  will  ensure  that,  by  the  end  of  project  implementation  a\nminimum of 150 people will have been trained in employment oriented skills, of\nwhich at least 33 percent will be women of all age groups and 40 percent are\nmale youths between 14 and 45 years.\n(vii)  The Government will ensure (a) equal access of all training providers to (i)\ntraining  materials  and  related  resources,  and  (ii)  all  curriculum  development\nundertaken  under  the  Project;  and  (b)  career  orientation  curricula  will  be\navailable to all private schools.\n(viii)  The Government has committed to provide the required recurrent expenditure\nfunding in each fiscal year beginning FY2002. The additional amount will be\nclearly appropriated to the education budget for vocational education and skills\ntraining.\n(ix)  The Government will acquire all land and other property rights required for the\nproject before the civil works contracts are awarded under the Project.\nB. Conditions of Loan Effectiveness\n159. Prior to loan effectiveness, the government has agreed to\n(i)  establish a project steering committee,\n(ii)  have MOE establish the PIU with staff and resources satisfactory to ADB, and\n(iii)  amend  the  Industries  Development  Act  1991  to  allow  MOE  to  have  overall\nresponsibility  for  planning  and  coordinating  skills  training  and  vocational\neducation in the RMI.\nC. Loan Disbursement\n160. The Government has agreed to accomplish the following\n(i)  prior to the loan being disbursed, the Government will deposit at least $75,000 in\nan imprest account to ensure availability of counterpart funding at the start of the\nProject; and\n(ii)  prior  to  any  disbursement  for  the  construction  of  the  Majuro  WTMIC,  the\nGovernment will ensure that the land required for the WTMIC is made available\nin accordance with arrangements satisfactory to ADB.", "37\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\n161. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of\nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various currencies equivalent to\nSpecial Drawing Rights 5,276,000 to the Republic of the Marshall Islands for the Skills Training\nand Vocational Education Project, with a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years\nwith an interest charge at the rate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5\npercent per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in\naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board.\nTADAO CHINO\nPresident\n6 November 2000", "APPENDIXES\nNumber Title Page Cited on\n(page, para.)\n1 Statistical Data on Education 38 3, 14\n2 College of Marshall Islands (CMI) Profile 42 4, 17\n3 Skills Training in RMI 43 6, 28\n4 Ministry of Education (MOE) Organization 45 9, 38\nChart\n5 Ministry of Education (MOE) Budget 46 9, 39\n6 Social Impact Assessment 47 14, 63\n7 Logical Framework 53 20, 86\n8 Cost Estimates 59 24, 110\n9 Implementation Schedule 63 26, 116\n10 Project Management Organization Chart 65 27, 117\n11 Procurement Packages 66 27, 118\n12 Outline Terms of Reference of Consultants 67 28, 120", "STATISTICAL DATA ON EDUCATION\nTable A1.1: Enrollment in Elementary and Secondary Education, 1999-2000\nPublic Private Public & Private\nGrade Boys Girls Total Boys Girls Total Boys Girls Total\nElementary\nPreschool 12 16 28 150 165 315 162 181 343\n1 532 477 1,009 187 185 372 719 662 1,381\n2 527 460 987 171 173 344 698 633 1,331\n3 586 474 1,060 165 160 325 751 634 1,385\n4 559 505 1,064 158 181 339 717 686 1,403\n5 617 534 1,151 162 162 327 779 699 1,478\n6 600 578 1,178 179 165 344 779 743 1,522\n7 573 569 1,140 166 160 326 739 729 1,466\n3\n8 505 570 1,075 152 122 274 657 692 1,349 8\nSubtotal 4,521 4,190 8,711 1,497 1,479 2,976 6,018 5,669 11,687\nSecondary\n9 185 143 328 249 253 502 434 396 830\n10 168 160 328 161 200 361 329 360 689\n11 133 143 276 161 135 296 295 278 572\n12 103 83 186 111 110 221 214 193 407\nSubtotal 589 529 1,118 682 698 1,380 1,271 1,227 2,498\nA\nTotal 5,110 4,719 9,829 2,195 2,177 4,356 7,289 6,896 14,185\np\np\ne\nSource: Ministry of Education. n\nd\nix\n \n1\n,\n \np\na\ng\ne\n \n1", "Table A1.2: Enrollment in Elementary and Secondary Education, 1998-1999\nPrivate Public Public and Private\nGrade Boys Girls Total Boys Girls Total Boys Girls Total\nElementary\nPreschool 136 132 268 22 18 40 156 150 306\n1 192 205 397 505 503 1,008 697 738 1,435\n2 131 178 309 610 470 1,080 741 648 1,389\n3 197 200 397 576 563 1,139 773 763 1,536\n4 179 189 368 629 502 1,131 808 691 1,499\n5 191 189 380 640 594 1,234 831 783 1,614\n6 193 171 364 603 609 1,212 796 780 1,576\n7 185 144 329 545 582 1,127 710 726 1,436\n8 163 143 306 631 645 1,276 794 788 1,582\nSubtotal 1,567 1,551 3,118 4,761 4,486 9,247 6,306 6,067 12,373\n3\n9\nSecondary\n9 283 277 560 200 203 403 483 480 963\n10 210 165 375 140 187 327 350 352 702\n11 160 125 285 109 110 219 269 235 504\n12 119 149 262 121 115 236 240 258 498\nSubtotal 772 716 1,482 570 615 1,185 1,342 1,325 2,667\nTotal 2,339 2,267 4,600 5,331 5,101 10,432 7,648 7,392 15,240\nA\nSource: Ministry of Education. p\np\ne\nn\nd\nix\n \n1\n,\n \np\na\ng\ne\n \n2", "Table A1.3: Distribution of Elementary and Secondary Schools by Atolls, SY1999\nElementary Schools Secondary Schools\nNo. Atoll Elem Male Female Total Teachers Teacher Sec Male Female Total Teachers Teacher Total Population\nSch Enroll.

Skills Training\n1. Until recently, skills training was provided under the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA)\nprogram  which  was  funded  by  the  United  States  federal  government.  The  JTPA  was\nestablished, among other things, to improve the effectiveness of the JTPA whereby Marshallese\nwho face severe constraints to finding employment receive support and training to increase their\nopportunities to find employment, provide training and services to participants, and maintain\nclose  relationship  with  ongoing  development  programs.  The  program  was  administered  by\nPrivate Industry Council of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. The PIC has 15 members, of\nwhom 8 are from the private sector nominated by the chamber of commerce. JTPA received a\nbudget of about $800,000 a year and operates a wide range of programs, including post\nsecondary vocational training\n2. JTPA  had  an  open  enrollment  policy,  which  provides  educational  and  vocational\nopportunities to youths and adults 14-55. Under the JTPA, vocational training programs that\nprovided skills for employment or self employment were conducted in response to community\nneeds.  The  programs  included  the  training  of  school  dropouts,  out-of-school  youth,  and\nsuperannuated civil service workers following the recent downsizing of the civil service. Some\nprograms involved supervised on-the-job experience with employers as well as practical training\nin  a  working  environment.  Most  JTPA  programs  will  be  continued  under  the  Workforce\nInvestment Act (WIA). JTPA\u2019s wide variety of programs include the following.\n(i)  Preemployment and work maturity skills training is a career awareness program.\n(ii)  Occupational skills training is an entry-level and semi-occupational skills training\nprogram  in  automotive  mechanic,  air-conditioning  and  refrigeration,  building\nmaintenance,  carpentry,  construction,  electricity,  secretarial,  small  engine,\nwelding, and sewing skills.\n(iii)  Institutional skills training is a more advanced skill training program in areas of\nautomotive mechanics, air-conditioning and refrigeration, building maintenance,\ncarpentry, construction, electricity, secretarial skills, small engine repair, welding\nand sewing.\n(iv)  Entrepreneurship and small business operation provides training in the effective\nformation and establishment of a small business.\n(v)  On-the-job  training  is  a  long-term  hands-on  training  in  partnership  with  an\nemployer  to  train  participants  in  actual  work  situations,  and  which  involves\nagreement that suitable trainees may be retained as employees.\n(vi)  Cooperative  work  experience  is  an  18  week  classroom  training  or  other\nenrichment or learning program that is facilitated through cooperation between\nthe employer and the training agency, with the employer paying the participants.\n(vii)  The summer youth employment and training program is an eight-week program\nthat  is  not  meant  to  be  an  employment  track  and  aims  at  enhancing  basic\neducation  skills  of  economically  disadvantaged  youth;  encouraging  school\ncompletion or enrollment through supplementary or alternative school programs;", "44\nAppendix 3, page 2\nand providing students exposure to the world of work. The program lasts for\nabout six weeks with up to 32 hours per week. The first week is devoted to\ntraining orientation, mathematics, and English and the students spend the next\nfive weeks with employers. Students are paid $2 an hour or $480 for 240 hours.\nThe  course  is  very  popular  and  there  are  many  applicants.  In  1997,  285\nparticipated of whom 13 completed the program and 10 were placed. This seems\nto be an expensive way of introducing students to the world of work, especially\nas scarce resources can be put to better use. The money could be used to\nstrengthen the prevocational programs, which are more efficient at exposing a\nlarge number of students to working situations.\n(viii)  The school enhancement program focuses on disadvantaged youths between\nthe ages of 14 and 16, and those who fail to enter high school.\n(ix)  Off-campus training is provided to both public and private sectors, e.g., the air\npilot training for Air Marshall Islands, Raytheon World control in Kwajalein, law\nenforcement  skills  upgrading,  teacher  training  skills  upgrading,  and  canoe\nbuilding skills training.\n(x)  The entrepreneurship and small business operation helps individual high school\nstudents, unemployed youth, and adults with employable skills to assess their\nself-employment potential and develop small businesses. Skills training in the\nouter islands in agriculture, pearl oyster culture, and other local skills also receive\nsupport.", "45\nAppendix 4\nMINISTRY OF EDUCATION\nORGANIZATION CHART\n(Elementary and Secondary Education)\nSpecial Assistant MINISTER\nNational Training Headstart\nADB Project Manager Council\nPREL Center Board of Regents RMI Scholarship\nCMI Board\nSecretary\nMedia\nElementary & Secondary Administrative & Logistic Curriculum & Instructional\nEducation Support Services Support Services\nElementary Education School-to-Work Vocational Education Secondary Education\nSupervisors Coordinator Director Supervisors\nJHS MIHS NIHS RMI-USP\nProject\nCounselors Dept.

Introduction\n1. A  social  and  poverty  assessment  was  undertaken  based  on  the  Handbook for\nIncorporation of Social Dimensions in Projects of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The\nobjective was to identify the needs of disadvantaged groups, particularly women, so that these\ngroups would specifically participate in and benefit from the Skills Training and Vocational\nEducation Project. Consultations, interviews, and community workshops were conducted in two\nurban centers and two outer islands. Workshops were held for members and leaders of women\nand youth organizations, other nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and church leaders on\nArno, Ebeye, Jaluit, and Majuro islands to gather primary data on social and poverty issues,\nsocial acceptability of the proposed project, skills requirements, and community perceptions on\ntraining needs particularly in the outer islands. Local and national government officials were\nconsulted to determine needs, issues, and priorities in relation to the Project. Participatory\nworkshop design was developed and conducted.\nB.  Initial Social and Poverty Assessment\n1.  Client Groups\n2. Like many atoll countries, the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) is small (population\n50,840),  with  meager  resources  and  a  rapidly  growing  population.  The  country  is  heavily\ndependent  on  outside  assistance  to  provide  social  services  and  to  sustain  its  people.\nEducational  attainment  is  generally  low.  Per  capita  income  is  about  $770  (1999).\nDemographically, the RMI is a young country with 43 percent of its population under 15 years\nold and an average household size of 8.9, both features indicative of a high rate of natural\nincrease. Due to emigration, the annual growth rate has been drastically reduced to 1.5 percent,\na  deep  plunge  from  10  years  ago  (4.2  percent)  with  the  RMI  having  one  of  the  highest\npopulation growth rates in the world. Unemployment has more than doubled in the last 10 years\nwith almost one third of its labor force currently unemployed, the majority of which are women.\nAlthough elementary education is mandatory, one of four of its adult population is illiterate. The\nRMI ranks 121st out of 175 countries on the human development index (HDI) of the United\nNations Development Programme (UNDP).\n3. The health and education profile of the RMI is alarming and compares with those of\nmuch poorer countries. The poor health of the population owes much to poor nutrition. For\nexample, the incidence of overweight and obesity (precursors to diabetes and other chronic\nillnesses) is approximately 56.5 percent in adults aged 18-50 years1 \u2014 essentially one out of\ntwo adults has developed or is likely to develop symptoms of diabetes and similar illnesses.\nAccording to a medical doctor interviewed in the Majuro government hospital, 8-10 patients,\naged 40 years and above, undergo amputations in the hospital daily due to diabetes-related\ncomplications.\n4. The overall life expectancy in the RMI is 68 years \u2014 66 years for males and 69 years for\nfemales, both well below average life expectancies in developed countries (80+ years) and in\nmany neighboring island countries. The RMI\u2019s leading health risks in the past 10 years have\ngradually  changed  from  being  predominantly  communicable  to  chronic  (e.g.,  diabetes  and\nhypertension). This trend can be attributed to an unbalanced and low quality nutritional intake.\n                                                \n1 Findings from a survey conducted by Johns Hopkins University between 1996 and 1997.", "48\nAppendix 6, page 2\n5. The literacy rate in the RMI is only 74 percent and the school dropout rate is high in all\ngrades. According to a study conducted by the Ministry of Education,2 only about 13 out of 100\nstudents who start grade 1 finish high school. Although elementary education is compulsory, an\nestimated 30 percent of children between ages 6-14 do not attend school.\n6. The working-age population (people aged 15-64) is estimated at 27,000 (55 percent), of\nwhich those in the labor force comprise 14,000 (54 percent). The balance of the working-age\npopulation has either never entered the labor force or has left it, instead relying mainly on\nremittances or subsistence farming and fishing. Most of unemployed people live in rural areas,\nand comprise a majority of the rural poor. Efforts to bring this large number of people into the\nactive labor force will improve incomes and assist the development of rural areas.\n7. Most households (73 percent) rely on income derived from wages and salaries followed\nby  business  operations  and  professions  (29  percent).  Another  major  income  source  is\nretirement, survivor, and disability pensions (20 percent). Remittances from abroad account for\nan insignificant 2 percent of total income. About 19 percent of households also earn income\nfrom dividends, rental royalties, and trusts (6 percent); and income from tips, commissions,\nbonuses, allowances, and others (13 percent).3\n2.  Client Needs\n8. Dropout rates at all grades are very high due to several factors: (i) the limited number of\nhigh schools available in the country, (ii) the poor quality of education, (iii) the limited number of\nqualified  teachers,  and  (iv)  a  widespread  lack  of  interest  towards  education.  According  to\nUNDP, dropout rates in the RMI are higher than in other Pacific countries.4\n9. The  present  skills  training  and  delivery  uses  outdated  curricula,  poorly  trained\ninstructors,  and  old  and  inadequate  equipment,  and  lacks  facilities,  training  goals  and\nstandards, coordination and cooperation between and among market and training providers,\nand certification. These factors often lead to a general malaise of hopelessness and apathy,\nparticularly  among  women  and  youth.  A  large  number  of  working-age  people  in  these\ncircumstances become resigned to staying in the outer islands in a subsistence existence or\nmoving to the urban centers in the hope of finding employment.\n3. Client Demand\n10. Training needs of the target beneficiaries, particularly women and youth,5 are: (i) skills to\nimprove food production (farming, poultry and hog raising, and fisheries); (ii) family-related skills\n(child care, sewing, cooking, gardening, nutrition, traditional medicine, reproductive health, and\nhousehold and small business management; (iii) traditional skills (canoe building); (iv) values\nformation  (parenting  and  teaching  skills,  and  gender  training);  and  (v) leadership  training.\nLimited training is currently provided by nongovernment organizations (NGOs) such as Youth to\nYouth in Health and church organizations. Areas covered include reproductive health, nutrition,\nand income generation with focus on handicraft production and canoe making.\n                                                \n2 Ministry of Education. 1999-2000 Enrollment Report.\n3 1999 Census of Population and Housing, Republic of the Marshall Islands.\n4 Pacific Human Development Report, 1999: Creating Opportunities. UNDP.\n5 Based on the results of community workshops held in the Arno Ebeye, Jaluit, and Majuro, by the ADB Mission from\n23 August\u20136 September 2000.", "49\nAppendix 6, page 3\n11. Under  use  of  existing  training  programs  is  caused  by  several  factors,  including\ninappropriate courses that do not meet clients\u2019 needs, inadequate facilities, poorly trained and\nlimited number of teachers, and lack of parental motivation. In practice, training and education\nare seen of lower priority than food, medical expenses, and clothing. Since most households in\nurban centers and most outer islands are highly dependent on imports for consumption, most\ndisposable income goes to food and clothing. Medical expenses are relatively high in household\nbudgets, due to the prevalence of nutrition-related illnesses. Schooling is ranked after all three\npriority needs had been met. Most households would benefit from training in budgeting and\nfamily planning.\n12. Women and youth organizations\u2019 expressed willingness to pay for training fees (in cash\nor in kind) provided that they get quality input from the Project. Since the US Compact funds\nstarted coming in about 14 years ago, a number of parents grew to expect that the Government\nwould provide for all education needs of their children. This is one of several reasons, that\nparents cited in interviews, for not allocating money for education, although many expressed\ninterest in educating their children.\n13. Beneficiaries\u2019 demand for training is expected to increase as people become aware of\nthe Project, its quality, appropriateness, and accessibility. The ability to pay for tuition fees can\nbe increased by using agricultural produce, for example, to pay for tuition and other expenses\nrather than hard-to-come-by cash, particularly in the outer islands.\n14. A similar practice has been successfully used by the Roman Catholic church since the\n1970s. The church\u2019s Busy Hands project provides for an avenue where cash-strapped parents\nfrom the outer islands can send their handicrafts to the church for sale and the proceeds go to\npay for their children\u2019s education fees.\n15. Although a number of parents still believe that formal or vocational education is of\nsecondary  priority,  there  is  an  increasing  desire  among  families,  even  among  the  poorer\npopulation, for training to increase their income. With the faster development of cash economy\nthroughout the rural RMI compared to other Pacific countries, finding employment and income\ngenerating  opportunities  are  strong  incentives  for  people  to  access  the  training  and  other\nsupport programs provided under the Project.\n4. Absorptive Capacity\n16. Conduct of intensive public information and education campaigns, the development of a\ncommunity outreach program, and the inclusion of housing units and hostels for students and\nteachers will contribute to increasing enrollment in skills and vocational training programs,\nparticularly for women. In response to household survey made in early 2000, most women and\nout-of-school youths would enroll to learn skills and pay for the training, if they (i) knew about\nthe  program  and  its  objectives;  (ii)  believe  that  the  training  would  significantly  increase\nprospects for employment or enable them to start a small business in their community; (iii) were\nconvinced that the type of training is appropriate and would be of immediate use; and (iv) were\naware that training will be available to beneficiaries, particularly those (e.g., mothers) who are\nunable to leave their families for extended periods and live in the training centers during training.\n17. Women and youth organizations in the RMI are mainly church-based and are in most\ncommunities in the urban centers and in the outer islands. Their involvement and interest in\neducation and skills training vary. During consultations with selected church organizations that", "50\nAppendix 6, page 4\nare also training providers (the Roman Catholic church, Pentecostal church, and Salvation\nArmy), indicate that these groups started similar, though small and seasonal, training for women\nand youth in the past. With some training and support, the numerous women\u2019s and youth\norganizations throughout the RMI6 can take an important role in popularizing the Project and the\nimportance of skills training. Thus, motivating them to take an active role in the different stages\nof the Project, mobilizing needed resources, and sustaining the Project after its implementation.\n5.

Pacific Human Development Report: Creating Opportunities.\n18. Marshallese society is ambilineal with rights and inheritance traced through the maternal\nand paternal lines. While, the matrilineal influence clearly dominates, thus according women\nhigh social status, control over inheritance and resources is normally exercised by a woman\u2019s\nbrother or uncle on her behalf, thus potentially undermining her actual authority. Clan rights,\nwhich include land entitlements and traditional authority, are passed down through matrilineal\nline.\n19. This setup is reflected especially in education. For example, enrollment in skills training\nand vocational education is usually low for females since most courses, except for selected\nofferings (cooking and sewing) are mainly tailored to the needs of males. Traditionally, although\nenjoying high social status, Marshallese women stay at home to give birth and take care of the\nchildren. Although Marshallese women are entering the job market in increasing numbers,\nbecoming involved in politics, or starting their own businesses, much more public information\nand  education  is  needed  on  the  role  of  women,  especially  in  the  outer  islands.  Greater\nopportunities  for  meaningful  participation  by  women  in  the  socioeconomic  spheres  of\nMarshallese society are needed.\n20. Also, the incidence of teenage pregnancies is increasing. Women leaders consulted\ncited  this  issue  as  a  major  barrier  to  young  women  continuing  their  education  (formal  or\ninformal). Although traditionally, when a pregnant daughter does not get married, parents are\nexpected to rear the child to allow the young mother to continue studying, this is not happening\nin most cases.\n                                                \n6 Canada Fund, according to a study conducted of NGOs and community-based organizations in 1998, estimated\nthat there are around 600 such organizations in RMI.\n7 Highest in 15 countries covered by the 1999 Pacific Human Development Report: Creating Opportunities. UNDP.", "51\nAppendix 6, page 5\n21. Based on these factors, development of gender-oriented courses will encourage female\nenrollment. Also, conduct of training with stress on sex education, reproductive health, and\ncontraception  will  be  prioritized,  thereby,  limiting  teenage  pregnancies,  improving  women\u2019s\neconomic prospects, and limiting family size. Also, access to quality training and improved\nfacilities will provide better career and entrepreneurial development opportunities for women,\nparticularly for young mothers. Moreover, skills training will benefit women and their families in\nthe form of increased food production and improved nutrition in their homes. Lastly, women\u2019s\nparticipation,  through  their  numerous  groups  actively  working  in  the  communities,  will  be\nencouraged through the provision of training and resources to effect meaningful changes not\nonly to their lives but also to their families.\n6. Potential Adverse Impacts\n22. No  adverse  impacts  are  anticipated.  Women  and  youth  have  been  identified  as\ncontinuing to need additional support to improve current self-help initiatives.\nC. Summary of Findings/Recommendations\n23. The main findings include\n(i)  the proposed skills and vocational training project is perceived as a timely and\nneeded intervention by the different stakeholders including NGOs, community-\nbased  organizations,  church  organizations,  local  government  officials,  and\ncommunity leaders and members;\n(ii)  priority training needs by community leaders and members consulted, particularly\nin the outer islands, are for income generation, food security, reproductive health,\nnutrition, and value formation;\n(iii)  lack of information on and limited access to available skills training by women\nand youth groups, aside from those selectively provided by church groups and\nNGOs;\n(iv)  NGOs and church organizations are implementing selective and limited skills\ntraining to respond to community needs in the urban centers and the outer\nislands;\n(v)  training centers are lacking, particularly in the outer islands;\n(vi)  communities/groups consulted are willing to pay (in cash or in kind) for quality\ntraining  that  would  facilitate  creation  of  employment  or  establishment  of  an\nenterprise; and\n(vii)  a significant amount of human resources are untapped and unmotivated (e.g.,\nschool dropouts and women).\n24. Based on the above findings, the following recommendations were incorporated into the\nproject design:\n(i)  Prioritize and target communities and focus on women and dropouts particularly\nin  isolated  and  inaccessible  outer  islands  to  maximize  the  Project\u2019s  poverty\nreduction  impact.  To  make  this  possible,  a  community  outreach  program  is\nincorporated in the Project.\n(ii)  Course offerings will focus on income generating skills and on food production,\ngender, reproductive health, and nutrition. Interventions to focus on developing\nbeneficiaries and NGOs need to be conducted before course development.", "52\nAppendix 6, page 6\n(iii)  NGOs and community-based organizations will be encouraged to participate in\nthe Project, particularly those affiliated with church organizations in the RMI.\nTheir involvement will be encouraged during project preparation, implementation,\nand evaluation in order to effectively deliver the Project, maximize its resources,\nand increase its sustainability.\n(iv)  The Majuro women\u2019s groups recommendation for the establishing a training and\nmarketing  center  for  women  will  be  supported  under  the  Project.  This  is  to\nincrease the training capacity of these groups to promote handicraft production\n(with  emphasis  on  quality)  and  facilitate  enterprise  development  initiated  by\nwomen.\n(v)  An intensive public information and education campaign will be developed before\nand  carried  out  during  project  implementation.  Women,  dropouts,  vocational\ntraining students, and skilled workers will be targeted by the campaign in order to\nencourage increased enrollment in the course in the training centers and the\noutreach programs.\n(vi)  A  gender  specialist  is  included  during  project  implementation  to  ensure  that\nwomen\u2019s  needs  are  properly  reflected  in  the  design  and  delivery  of  training\ncourses.\n(vii)  Consultations and dialogues with community leaders and members will continue.\nThese groups commended ADB for initiating this participatory approach and\nexpressed  their  willingness  to  be  involved  in  this  Project  throughout  the\nimplementation period and in other future initiatives by ADB.", "53\nAppendix 7, page 1\nLOGICAL FRAMEWORK\nNarrative Summary Indicators and Targets Monitoring Key Assumptions\nMechanisms\nGoal\nImproved economic (cid:1) Project documents, Economic growth is\nself-reliance project implementation maintained\nunit (PIU) reports, Compact fund is\nAsian Development available\nBank (ADB) reviews Birthrate is maintained\nRate of emigration is\nstabilized\nHigh standard of\nsupervision of PIU and\nreview missions\nmaintained\nPurpose\n1.Increased income- (cid:1) Project documents, Government\ngenerating PIU reports, ADB development plans in\nopportunities reviews outer islands are\nespecially for (cid:1) Sample survey of implemented\nwomen and the women and the youth Incremental recurrent\nyouth in the outer to be done at end of expenditures are funded\nislands Project by training unit by Government and\nmanagers of those external agencies.\ntrained\n2.Increased (cid:1) PIU reports, ADB Training centers are fully\nemployment review Missions operational, economic\nespecially for (cid:1) Joint sample survey of opportunities in outer\nwomen and the women and youth to be islands are increased,\nyouth in the outer done at end of Project Annual dropout and\nislands by training unit emigration is stable\nmanagers of those\ntrained\nOutputs\n1.
