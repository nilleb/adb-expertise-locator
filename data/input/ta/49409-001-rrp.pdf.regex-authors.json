THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \ntechnical assistance loan to Erdenes Mongol LLC, to be guaranteed by  Mongolia, for the \nStrengthening Institutional Framework and Management Capacity Project.1 \n \n2.  The project aims to support ongoing reforms to strengthen institutional framework and \nmanagement  capacity  of  Erdenes  Mongol,  a  state-owned  investment  (asset  management) \ncompany established in 2007. As legislative and regulatory reforms are being made to enable \nErdenes Mongol to manage the state-owned assets more effectively to benefit the welfare of all \nMongolian people, the project provides essential capacity development support to help Erdenes \nMongol fulfill its evolving mandate of managing various state-owned assets and investing in \ninfrastructure to support Mongolia\u2019s economic diversification.   \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Mongolia\u2019s economy relies heavily on the mining sector, which accounts for 20% of the \ngross  domestic  product. 2  This  heavy  dependence  has  made  the  country  economically \nvulnerable  to  volatility  in  the  international  commodity  market.  At  the  same  time,  strategic \ninvestment in important economic infrastructure is necessary if Mongolia is to succeed in its \neffort to diversify its economy. Given a large land area with small and dispersed population, \ninadequate transport infrastructure is a critical obstacle to national unity and export growth. Yet, \nMongolia  does  not  have  an  effective  mechanism  to  channel  funds  raised  from  its  natural \nresources to strategic investments necessary for the development and diversification of the \neconomy.  The  national  development  strategy  for  2008\u20132021  identified  this  as  a  crucial \neconomic  challenge  and  since  then  efforts  have  been  continued  under  successive \ngovernments.3  \n \n4.  In Mongolia, the government plays an important role in investing in key economic areas. \nThe government needs to ensure that the economic benefits derived from the development of \nthe country\u2019s mineral resources are effectively invested to generate sustainable returns, while \nsupporting national unity and economic diversification. Good governance is required for the \nstate\u2019s investment and management of assets to be effective. Good governance demands \nefficiency, accountability, and transparency. Information on the processes and results of state \ninvestment  decision-making  needs  to  be  made  public.  Moreover,  if  the  state  engages  in \ninvestment activities, its role as a regulator needs to be clearly separated from its role as an \ninvestor to avoid conflicts of interest and ensure fairness and equality in the market.  \n \n5.  The government created the 100% state-owned Erdenes Mongol in 2007 to manage \nstate-owned  assets  and  make  state  investments  more  strategic  and  effective.4 Erdenes \nMongol\u2019s portfolio has grown from holding shares of one mining company in 2010 to four \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The second-largest component is wholesale and retail, which accounts for 17%. Government of Mongolia. 2013. \nAchieving Millennium Development Goal: Fifth Progress Report. Ulaanbaatar. \n3  Government of Mongolia. 2008. Comprehensive National Development Strategy of Mongolia. Ulaanbaatar. \n4  The company had a staff of 68 as of 2015. It comprised a chief executive office, with responsibilities for human \nresource management and legal matters; an infrastructure management department; a project management \ndepartment; and a finance and accounting department that handles financial analysis and financial management. \nErdenes Mongol held about MNT 2.4 trillion ($1.2 billion) in assets, as of 2015, including non-mining and mining \nassets. \n ", "2     \n \ncompanies by 2015.5 While government line ministries focus on policies and regulations in the \nsectors in which the state invests, Erdenes Mongol aims to manage state-owned assets and \nraise  funds  to  invest  in  economic  infrastructure  for  the  benefit  of  the  general  public.  Its \nestablishment aimed at the bifurcation of the state\u2019s dual roles of regulator and investor, which \nis a prerequisite to achieving good governance. Erdenes Mongol is evolving into managing \nvarious state-owned assets in both mining and non-mining sectors, and investing in economic \ninfrastructure to enhance economic diversification.6  \n \n6.  However, Erdenes Mongol has not fully realized its potential in generating revenues and \neffectively leveraging funds for further investments. Its functionality, efficiency, and profitability \nhave been limited by various constraints. Under the legal framework which originally established \nErdenes Mongol, the company was treated as a public agency even though it is an investment \ncompany with its own budget, which is independent from the state budget. In addition, Erdenes \nMongol did not have the authority to retain dividends from its investee companies; until recent \namendment, the Human Development Fund, created in 2009, was the recipient of the dividends. \nIts status as a public agency also left it with limited managerial flexibility, and its compensation \nstructure could not attract or retain competent professionals. The public sector requirements \nimposed on it also meant that it would take longer to process procurement or investments than it \nwould as a commercial entity.  \n \n7.  In February 2016, the Parliament approved the amendments to the Human Development \nFund  Law,  authorizing  Erdenes  Mongol  to  retain  dividends  from  its  investee  companies. \nFurthermore, under the amended law, the Charter of Erdenes Mongol, which was originally \nbased on the State and Local Property Law, is being revised based on the Company Law.7 \nThese developments in the legal framework will strengthen Erdenes Mongol\u2019s financial position, \nand allow it to operate its business as a commercial entity. Based on the Company Law and its \nrevised Charter, Erdenes Mongol\u2019s governance structure will also be reformed. It will have three \nindependent directors in its nine-member board of directors. The board of directors will have the \nauthority to appoint the executive director (i.e., the chief executive officer), in contrast to the \nearlier arrangement that the chief executive officer of Erdenes Mongol was appointed by the \ngovernment. This reform will improve transparency in management and allow Erdenes Mongol \nto be managed commercially with little political interference in future. \n \n8.  The approval of the amendments to the Human Development Fund Law also calls for \nurgent  and  substantial  improvement  of  Erdenes  Mongol\u2019s  institutional  and  management \ncapacities to fulfill its evolving mandate. Currently, Erdenes Mongol does not have a clear \ncorporate strategy with medium and long-term targets. It also does not have sufficient capacity \nto identify investment opportunities that are appropriate to support the country\u2019s economic \ndiversification with adequate attention to environmental management.  \n \n9.  The company\u2019s corporate structure must be reformed to ensure sound governance, \n                                                \n5  In 2010, Erdenes Mongol was made responsible for 100% of shares of Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi, which operates a \nstrategic mineral asset in Mongolia. As of January 2016, in addition to Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi, Erdenes Mongol \nholds shares in the following three mining companies as the majority shareholder: Shivee Ovoo (90% of the \nshares), Banganuur (75% of the shares), and Erdenes Mining Corporation (51% of the shares). As a minor \nshareholder, Erdenes Mongol also holds 34% shares of Oyu Tolgoi that operates a strategic mineral asset of \nMongolia.    \n6  Khazanah of Malaysia is a similar strategic company owned by the government. \n7  The amendments to Human Development Fund Law have been approved, and the amended Human Development \nFund Law will be renamed as the Future Heritage Fund Law. The revised Charter of Erdenes Mongol will become \neffective in 2016, and it will be authorized to retain dividends from investee companies from 2017. ", "        3 \n \nprudent risk management, and efficient administration.8 It needs to adopt the management \nstructure in line with its business functions to analyze business risks and opportunities, and \nmake strategic investment decisions. It also needs to develop corporate functions to provide \nlegal, economic, and market analyses and information to support the efficient and effective \nfunctioning of the management. While currently Erdenes Mongol\u2019s financial investment and risk \ndivision in its finance and accounting department can only carry limited financial analysis, the \ncompany must develop its asset and liability management capacity to ensure prudent risk \nmanagement.  Strengthening  the  financial  management  and  social  and  environment \nmanagement  capacity  is  also  essential  for  sound  corporate  governance  and  compliance \nmanagement. For efficient administration, functions such as human resources management \nneed to be improved. It is also necessary to establish clear business processes to promote \nefficient use of financial and human resources.  \n \n10.  The interim country partnership strategy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for \nMongolia  for  2014\u20132016  identified  economic  diversification  as  a  major  medium-term \ndevelopment challenge facing the country. It also stressed the importance of efficient public \nsector management and the establishment of a sovereign wealth fund.9 Strengthening Erdenes \nMongol\u2019s institutional framework and management capacity will significantly contribute to the \neffective management of Mongolia\u2019s state-owned assets and making sound investments for the \ndiversification of the national economy.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The impact of the project will be the effective management and use of Mongolia\u2019s state-\nowned  assets  for  the  benefit  of  the  country\u2019s  people.  The  expected  outcome  is  Erdenes \nMongol\u2019s capacity developed for its envisaged development. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n12.  The project will provide for capacity development and advisory services to deliver three \nintended outputs. It will not prepare feasibility studies or a detailed engineering design of an \ninvestment project. \n \n13.  Output 1: Corporate strategy developed. The project will analyze the new legal and \nbusiness framework to assess the changing business environment and determine the best \nstrategy for Erdenes Mongol to adopt for its operations. This will include examination of the \npotential for new fund-raising schemes and possibilities for holding state-owned enterprises in \nthe non-mining sector. The project will also conduct a detailed institutional analysis of the \ncompany and will help develop a corporate strategy to identify its midterm and long-term targets \nand milestones.   \n \n14.  Output  2:  Functional  capability  strengthened.  To  strengthen  Erdenes  Mongol\u2019s \nmanagement  capacity,  the  project  will  help  establish  three management groups  within  the \ncompany  and  hire  high-level  management  consultants  to  engage  in  these  groups  for  a \ntransitional period of about 2 years. An advisory experts group, a strategy and risk management \ngroup,  and  an  executive  management  recruitment  group  will  strengthen  the  management \nsystem and will play critical roles in helping managers make investment decisions and ensuring \n                                                \n8 The functional capacity of Erdenes Mongol was assessed based on its financial management, procurement, \nbusiness practices, organizational structure and close consultation with its management.  \n9 ADB. 2014.

It  will  assist  Erdenes  Mongol  in  the  hiring  and  retention  of  middle-level \nmanagement  consultants  for  these  operations  for  the  transitional  period.  Improvements  in \nfinancial  management  will  cover  reporting,  accounting,  auditing,  internal  control,  and  the \nfacilitation of external auditing by an audit firm.  \n \n15.  The project will also help Erdenes Mongol review and reform its business processes to \nmake them more efficient and enable the company to expand its businesses. The project will \nsupport its capacity development during the transitional period by providing Erdenes Mongol \nwith the necessary training at various stages of reform for (i) senior management, (ii) unit heads, \nand  (iii)  general  staff.  The  project  will  assess  and  strengthen  the  existing  management \ninformation system (MIS) as it relates to supply chain management, project management, and \nfinancial management.  \n \n16.  Output 3: Investment capability strengthened. The project will help Erdenes Mongol \ndevelop  its  ability  to  diversify  its  asset  base  to  increase  investments  in  infrastructure that \nMongolia needs to support overall economic diversification. This will include the capacity to \nidentify sound, appropriate investment opportunities and conduct due diligence. These will be \nachieved  by  providing  the  company  with  advisory  and  capacity  development  consulting \nservices. The project will also help to identify state-owned assets for potential acquisition and \nconduct an institutional and legal assessment of the possibility of Erdenes Mongol holding non-\nmining assets. \n \nD.

Erdenes  Mongol  has  requested  a  loan  of  $35  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years, annuity repayment method based on 30% discount factor, an annual interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin the loan agreement.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Finance \n \n22.  Erdenes Mongol is responsible for managing several kinds of state-owned assets and \nmaking  economic  investments.  It  also  explores  opportunities  for  strengthening  its  financial \ncapacity and expanding its investments in the non-mining sector and other assets.  \n \n23.  The project will strengthen Erdenes Mongol\u2019s institutional framework and management \ncapacity, which will make it better able to manage state-owned assets and invest strategically \nand  effectively.  This  is  necessary  to  help  Mongolia  enhance  its  investment  in  economic \ninfrastructure and diversify the economy. The project will support Erdenes Mongol to play an \nimportant role in leveraging additional funds for these types of investment. As an investment \ncompany with a strong financial base and greater expertise, it will be in a better position than \nthe government to make investments on behalf of the state and to manage state-owned assets \nefficiently. As a state-owned enterprise, Erdenes Mongol can also take a longer-term view than \na private company may possibly have, and this is particularly important to ensure that the \ncountry\u2019s natural resources are managed with long-term strategic objectives in mind.  ", "        7 \n \n \n24.  The  project\u2019s  improvement  of  Erdenes  Mongol  capacity  will  yield  direct  economic \nbenefits. The company will be able to manage its existing assets better at a reduced cost. In the \nshort-term, Erdenes Mongol is expected to make investments financed by the below mentioned \ntoll road revenues, and a management fee and dividends from its investee companies. The \nimproved  management  of  Erdenes  Mongol  would  boost  the  performance  of  its  investee \ncompanies, which will improve its own financial position. The improved financial position with \nstrengthened  financial  strategies  will  help  Erdenes  Mongol  leverage  more  funds  to  further \nexpand its investment in the medium and long term. This will enable the company to make \neffective new investments in areas such as basic infrastructure and transport that are key to \nMongolia\u2019s efforts to diversify the economy. Strengthening transport, especially by rail, is crucial \nto  meet  the  landlocked  country\u2019s  need  to  expand  its  exports.  Better  internal  and  external \ntransport connectivity will also spur economic growth in cities and regions beyond the major \nurban center and capital, Ulaanbaatar. Economic growth and diversification supported by future \nErdenes Mongol investment will help raise the living standards of Mongolia\u2019s people. \n \n25.   An ADB financial analysis of Erdenes Mongol reviewed its past and projected financials. \nThe  company\u2019s  audited  financials  for  the  years  of  2012,  2013,  and  2014  show  annual \noperations losses. The losses grew in 2014 due to the addition of a toll road asset that was only \ngradually increasing its revenue base while incurring full operational costs. Erdenes Mongol\u2019s \ncharter  allows  it  to  charge  a  management  fee  of  3%  of  operating  costs  to  its  investee \ncompanies, but it has not been charged yet. Erdenes Mongol plans to charge the management \nfee from 2016. \n \n26.  The legislation has been finalized for the proposed legal change to provide Erdenes \nMongol with a new source of revenues that it has so far been denied\u2014dividends from the \ncompanies  in  which  it  holds  investments  (para.  7).  Because  revenues  from  dividends  will \ndepend on the performance of the investee companies, the conservative scenario in ADB\u2019s \nfinancial  analysis  removed  these  sources  from  cash  flows.  In  addition,  ADB  analysis \nconservatively  adjusted  projected  toll  road  revenues  downward  by  50%  to  reflect  current \nvolatility in the commodities cycles. Nonetheless, the resulting projected cash flows remained \nadequate to meet Erdenes Mongol\u2019s debt servicing requirements, including those for the ADB \nproject loan. To ensure financial sustainability, ADB has proposed loan covenants to require \nspecific debt service coverage, debt-to-equity, and operating ratios. The sovereign guarantee \nalso provides overall assurance that the loan will be repaid.  \n \nB.  Governance \n \n27.  Erdenes Mongol has a finance and accounting department and a separate internal audit \nunit with adequately qualified staff members who are either accountants or investment officers. \nThey  have  appropriate  experience  of  about  3  years  on  average  in  accounting  and/or \ncommercial  investment  firms.  The  company  prepares  its  accounts  in  accordance  with \nMongolia\u2019s national accounting laws and rules, established by the Ministry of Finance. Based on \nthe  ministry\u2019s  guidance  for  state-owned  enterprises,  Erdenes  Mongol  developed  its  own \naccounting policies and procedures. It has its annual financial statements prepared and audited \nin accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. The finance and accounting \ndepartment has a staff of 13, which is generally adequate for dealing with the company\u2019s current \nbusinesses, but would be too small for additional externally funded projects. The staff has no \nexperience in implementing ADB-funded projects.  \n \n28.  ADB\u2019s financial management assessment showed that Erdenes Mongol will need help to \n ", "8     \n \nimplement  the  project.  This  support  will  include  a  financial  management  specialist  to  be \nengaged in the PIU staff and an audit specialist for external auditing of the project. The project \nwill also provide guidance and training for Erdenes Mongol and PIU staff on ADB guidelines and \nprocedures for (i) financial management and reporting; (ii) budget preparation and oversight; (iii) \ndisbursement; (iv) the financial audit process and requirements; and (v) proper use of, and \naccounting for, the imprest accounts and the statement of expenditure.  \n \n29.  The  strengthening  of  Erdenes  Mongol\u2019s  overall financial  management  systems  is a \nmajor project component and is needed to position the company to expand its activities. This \nfinancial  management  component  will  focus  on  (i)  accounting  policies  and  procedures  for \nInternational Financial Reporting Standards; (ii) institutional arrangements for good governance; \n(iii) internal oversight and governance capacity, including stronger internal auditing; (iv) external \noversight capacity for external audit and full compliance with the International Standards of \nAuditing; and (v) upgraded MIS and information and communication technology systems to \naccommodate the reformed financial management processes. ADB\u2019s assessment found that the \nproject\u2019s pre-mitigation financial management risk was moderate and would be adequately \nmitigated through the measures planned under this project component. \n \n30.  Public procurement in Mongolia is conducted in accordance with the country\u2019s public \nprocurement law, which requires the use of open competitive tendering and conflicts in no \nfundamental way with ADB\u2019s consultants\u2019 and procurement guidelines. The basic principles and \nrequirements are largely the same. Mongolia has promulgated the Anticorruption Law, related \nregulations, and anti-fraud measures in public procurement. Erdenes Mongol has a full-time \nprocurement specialist and about 10 related technical staff, as well as experience in managing \nprojects  supported  by  multilateral  and  bilateral  development  partners.  The  project  will \nstrengthen Erdenes Mongol\u2019s capacity in procurement in terms of efficiency and governance. It \nwill  also  support  the  engagement  by  the  PIU  specialists  to  support  the  recruitment  and \nprocurement activities and ensure smooth implementation. Because these mitigating actions will \nreduce the potential risk for project procurement issues, this risk is considered to be low. \n \n31.  The government recognizes the risk of corruption in the public sector and established \nthe Mongolian Anticorruption Agency in 2004 specifically to fight corruption at all levels of \ngovernment. The agency\u2019s work includes oversight of the management of public expenditures, \nincluding those for procurement. Members of the selection committee for procurement sign the \nnotice of the procurement for conflict of interest. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended \nto date) was explained to and discussed with Erdenes Mongol during the project preparation. \nThe  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  PAM \n(footnote 10).  \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n32.  The project will provide the capacity development and advisory services for Erdenes \nMongol. It is not expected to have a direct impact on poverty and social issues, but would have \nan indirect impact on poverty. Improving the management of state-owned assets and state \ninvestment will help diversify Mongolia\u2019s economy, which, in turn, would improve the overall \nwelfare of the poor. The project will also strengthen the company\u2019s public relations, which will \nimprove its communications with stakeholders, communities, and such groups as nonprofit \norganizations.  \n \n33.  ADB  has  classified  the  project  as  some  gender  elements.  It  will  provide  capacity \ndevelopment support for female and male Erdenes Mongol staff and ensure that the women on ", "        9 \n \nthe staff benefit from this support equally with the men. It will provide a session targeted at \nfemale staff to enhance career development. The project will also develop a module on how to \nintegrate the gender perspective into investment decision making processes including simple \ngender analysis tools.  \n   \nD.  Safeguards \n \n34.  Environment. The project is classified as category C for environment, since no adverse \nenvironmental impacts are expected from the project, which will not result in an investment \nproject. The project will have positive environmental benefits. It will establish a social and \nenvironment management unit in Erdenes Mongol to ensure that the company complies with \nrelated laws and regulations. It will further help Erdenes Mongol develop its internal guidelines \non  environmental  and  social  safeguards  by  establishing  an  environment  and  social \nmanagement system meant to ensure continued compliance with Mongolia\u2019s environmental \nstandards  and  to  make  the  company\u2019s  future  investments  environmentally  and  socially \nsustainable. In addition, the project will develop and implement a capacity development plan for \nErdenes Mongol\u2019s staff to strengthen the company\u2019s environmentally and socially sustainable \ndevelopment knowledge. \n \n35.  Resettlement. The project\u2019s involuntary resettlement category is C. It will require neither \nland acquisition nor resettlement. \n \n36.  Indigenous peoples. The project is classified as category C for indigenous peoples. \nThe assessment determined that the project will not affect ethnic minority communities directly \nor indirectly. \n \nE.  Risk and Mitigating Measures \n37.  Under the amended Human Development Fund Law, approved in February 2016, the \nCharter of Erdenes Mongol is being revised based on the Company Law. The approved legal \nreform  strengthens  Erdenes  Mongol\u2019s  legal  status,  and  reduces  political  influence  on  its \noperations and associated risks. The integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh \nthe costs. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.11  \n \nTable 4.

Given that it has been supported by successive governments since \nthen, its sustainability is not considered to be an issue as to which \npolitical party will be in power. In addition, under the revised HDFL, \nthe Charter of Erdenes Mongol is being revised based on the \nCompany Law, which will change the authority of appointment of the \nexecutive director from the government to the board of directors of \nErdenes Mongol. The board of directors will also include three \nindependent directors in its nine members. These reforms further \nreduce political influence on Erdenes Mongol\u2019s operations.  \nLack of familiarity with ADB  The project will train the executing and implementing agencies and \nprocedures could delay project  PIU staff who will assume day-to-day management of the project in \n                                                \n11 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10     \n \nimplementation.  the procurement, disbursement, and financial management \nrequirements of applicable ADB guidelines, policies, and regulations.  \nLimited staffing in the  A PIU will be established to carry out day-to-day project activities, \nimplementing agencies may  including financial management and procurement.
