During the country programming mission of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in \n2004, the Government of India requested technical assistance (TA) to prepare for the proposed \nNorth East Power Development Project.1 An ADB fact-finding mission visited India from 20 to 29 \nOctober 2004 for field visits and discussions with representatives from the Department of \nEconomic Affairs, the Ministry of Power (MOP), the Ministry of Development of North East \nRegion (MDONER), and other relevant agencies. The mission also met with a cross section of \nlocal residents in the proposed project area. The mission and the Government reached an \nunderstanding  on  the  rationale,  objectives,  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  terms  of \nreference, and cost estimates of a project preparatory TA for the Project. The preliminary project \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Background. The North East Region (NER)2 is one of the poorest regions in India, with \n32% of its 39 million people living below the poverty line. Despite its strategic location (bordering \ncountries  belonging  to  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  and  the  South  Asian \nAssociation for Regional Cooperation, see map) it remains economically isolated. Moreover, \nbecause of its geography and rugged terrain, connections within the region are poor. Access to \nbasic infrastructure facilities and services, particularly in rural areas, is minimal, as is private \nsector investment. Environmental conditions are poor because of inadequate investments in \ninfrastructure, especially in urban areas. The net state domestic product in the period 1993\u2013\n2000, has grown at an average of 3.6% per year, much lower than the national average of \n6.7%. An initial poverty and social assessment is in Appendix 2. \n \n3.  Recognizing that economic  growth  is  essential  for  poverty  reduction,  in  1998  the \nGovernment  decided  to  commit  10%  of  the  annual  budget  to  strengthen  development \nassistance  to  the  NER.  Recently,  law  and  order  has  significantly  improved,  although \ninsurgencies  still  pose  obstacles  to  economic  development.  MDONER  is  the  central \nGovernment\u2019s development focal point and has a mandate to coordinate and manage the flow \nof infrastructure developments by state governments, the North East Council (NEC),3 MOP, and \npublic sector utilities (e.g., the North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Ltd. [NEEPCO]), \namong others.4 Any unspent funds of the 10% fiscal allocation are to be pooled for development \nactivities  coordinated  by  MDONER.5  While  MDONER,  NEC,  and  state  governments  have \naddressed immediate regional necessities, basic infrastructure is still a major constraint on \neconomic development in the NER.  \n \n4.  Energy Sector. The NER power sector suffers from problems common to those in other \nparts of India. Transmission and distribution losses are high, because of technical losses, \nunmetered connections, theft, and subsidies to agricultural consumers. Current generating \ncapacity is theoretically sufficient to meet regional demand, but about 5% of power demand is \nmet  by  imports  from  the  eastern  region  of  India.  Intraregional  power  demand  has  been \nsuppressed, mainly because of the weak regional grid. Demand\u2013supply forecasts indicate an \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 12 October 2004. \n2  The region comprises Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, and Tripura. \n3  NEC comprises representatives of each state in the NER, and has responsibility for channeling some investment \nfunds to NER and state-level projects. \n4  Another key stakeholder is the Brahmaputra Board, a river basin agency responsible for all development involving \nabstraction or use of the watershed, e.g., flood control, hydropower, irrigation, and municipal supply. \n5  Each line ministry allocates 10% of its budget to NER.  MDONER is responsible for managing the unutilized portion \nof non-lapsable funds of these ministries as well. ", "2 \nincrease  in  power  shortages  unless  significant  investments  are  made  in  generating, \ntransmission, and distribution capacity. A lack of institutional integration is also problematic. In \nthe  NER,  two  states  have  state  electricity  boards  (SEBs),  and  five  states  have  power \ndepartments that perform similar functions. The NER states are beginning to implement sector \nreforms required by the Electricity Act of 2003, and the SEBs and power departments have \nbegun unbundling work to the extent possible.  \n \n5.  Insufficient  delivery  capacity  and  the  lack  of  interconnectivity  between  regional \ntransmission and local distribution networks limit economic development in the NER.  Three \nmajor  factors  constrain  further  development  of  NER  energy  resources:  (i)  physical  space \nconstraints in West Bengal, which limit expansion of gas and electric power transmission \ncapacities; (ii) a lack of standing agreements for energy trading with neighboring countries \n(especially with Bangladesh) which could help to eliminate the transmission bottleneck;6 and (iii) \na weak regional grid with limited interconnections between 400 kilovolt (kV), 220 kV, and 132 kV \nlines; insufficient capacity; and weak distribution networks providing an unreliable service. The \nmaster plan for power development prepared by NEC identifies improvements to transmission \nand distribution systems and the provision of additional generating capacity as critical areas for \nshort-term investment.  \n \n6.  Of the Indian regions, the NER has the second largest concentration of crude oil and \nnatural gas resources, representing about 20% of national reserves. Assam and Tripura have \ngas-fired power plants with power-generating capacity of 785 megawatts (MW). Current NER \nnatural gas reserves could provide about 2000 MW of power generating capacity.7 Current \nhydropower capacity of about 1,130 MW will increase by 369 MW during the Tenth Five-Year \nPlan  period  (2002\u20132007)  and  by  8,800  MW  during  the  Eleventh  Plan  period.  Additional \nhydropower potential is estimated at over 10,000 MW, including 2000 MW of small projects \n(less than 25 MW per site).8 \n \n7.  India\u2019s Country Strategy and  Program Update (2005-2007) pays special attention to \npower, transport, and urban development in response to the Government\u2019s request for support \nfor accelerated development in the NER. A greater focus on the NER is consistent with ADB\u2019s \nefforts to promote economic development in remote areas.  The Government has requested \nassistance for power sector improvements in the NER and the TA and ensuing Project will \nsupport  grid  strengthening,  power  generation  to  supply  the  NER  grid,  and  institutional \nstrengthening to assist ongoing sector reforms.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n8.  The TA will support preparation of the proposed North East Power Development Project, \nwhich is integral to the Government\u2019s \u201cPower for all by 2012\u201d initiative in the NER. The proposed \nproject  will  develop  locally  available  resources,  including  hydropower,  natural  gas,  and \n                                                 \n6  ADB has provided assistance to POWERGRID through a loan including subprojects in NER. ADB. 1995. Report \nand Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Power Grid \nCorporation of India Limited for the Power Transmission (Sector) Project. Manila. However, the existing 400 kV line \nconstructed by POWERGRID is operating below capacity (220 kV) because of pricing and contractual issues. \n7  In 2003, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited discovered a major natural gas field nearby in offshore waters of \nMyanmar, with an estimated 4 trillion to 6 trillion cubic feet (113 billion to 169 billion cubic meters) of commercial \nreserves. Transport options being considered include pipelines through NER and a subsea pipeline across the Bay \nof Bengal.   \n8  Central public sector utilities (e.g., NEEPCO, and National Hydro-Electric Power Corporation) are developing large \npower projects, mainly intended for export to the rest of India. ", "    3 \nrenewable energy sources; provide critical transmission and distribution facilities; and support \ninstitutional strengthening.  The TA will be implemented in two phases: (i) an energy sector \nassessment for the NER, and (ii) a review of feasibility studies for investment components in \nselected states of the NER.9 Phase I will include compiling existing reports and analysis on \nenergy sector issues and recommend strategy and investment priorities. Phase II will evaluate \ninvestment  proposals  prepared  by  MDONER  in  selected  states  and  will  include  technical, \nenvironmental, financial, economic, social, and institutional analysis.   \n \n9.  The expected outputs of Phase I are as follows.  \n \n(i)  A review of sector issues; an assessment of energy demand; a least-cost \nenergy  development  plan;  an  analysis  of  energy  resource  availability  and \nsupply, location, potential, capacity, and economic feasibility; a survey of social \nand  environmental  limitations;  a  review  of  the  potential  for  off-grid  energy \nsources;  and  an  assessment  of  the  need  for  critical  transmission  and \ndistribution facilities development and/or rehabilitation. \n(ii)  Well-defined priorities and strategies  for developing the energy sector of the \nNER as a whole and for each of its states; and proposed investment packages \ndeveloped  in  consultation  with  central,  regional,  and  state  government \nagencies, local stakeholders, potential investment agencies and private sector \npartners. Phase I will identify proposed investment packages, consistent with \nleast-cost expansion plans, to be analyzed in detail in phase II. \n \n10.  The expected outputs of Phase II are as follows. \n \n(i)  An assessment of the technical merits of proposed generation schemes (e.g., \ngas-fired power, hydropower, and renewable energy sources), and the most \nnecessary  development  or  rehabilitation  of  transmission  and  distribution \nfacilities.   \n(ii)  A policy matrix for energy development, taking into account possible sector \nreforms, economies of scale, and other factors.  \n(iii)  An assessment of the technical, financial, social, economic, and environmental \nviability of investments that are being proposed for external financial support. \n(iv)  An assessment of capacity building, training, and institutional strengthening \nneeds and a plan to address them. \n(v)  Proposals for best-practice guidelines for energy development with special \nemphasis on small and medium-sized hydropower systems. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n \n11.  The  objective  of  the  TA  and  ensuing  investment  project  is  to  support  least-cost \nexpansion  of  the  regional  power  system  in  the  NER  in  an  economically,  financially, \nenvironmentally, and socially sustainable manner. Phase I will cover an energy sector review, \nincluding resource availability, power supply and demand analysis, existing policies and sector \nreform agenda assessment, and indicative economic assessments, including a thorough review \nof least-cost expansion plans. Phase II will review feasibility studies prepared for investments in \ngeneration, transmission, distribution, and efficiency enhancements in the power system. It will \nalso review the appropriateness of due diligence and compliance requirements of investment \n                                                 \n9 Resource availability and geographical differences may not allow all NER states to be covered under one \ninvestment project. ", "4 \noptions, including the need for institutional strengthening and capacity building, so that the \nensuing project will enable sustainable economic growth that will help to reduce poverty.  \n \n12.  The ensuing investment project will have the following components. \n \n13.  Component A: Grid Strengthening. This will include critical system improvements \nsuch as (i) interconnections between 400 kV, 220 kV, and 132 kV lines to allow efficient delivery \nof power within the NER; (ii) renovation, maintenance, and upgrade of local grids less than 132 \nkV, including distribution systems; and (iii) upgrade of dispatch and metering systems.    \n \n14.  Component  B:  Power  Development.  This  will  support  expansion  of  commercial \ngenerating capacity serving the NER grid, targeting investments that can be locally developed \nand  managed  as  far  as  possible.  Proposed  projects  may  include  small  to  medium-sized \nhydropower, gas-fired power plants, and possibly renewable energy (e.g., biomass). Least-cost \nexpansion analysis will be used to define investments for components A and B.     \n \n15.  Component C:  Institutional Strengthening. This will support improving the technical, \nfinancial, and management capabilities of SEBs, power departments, and other agencies in \naccordance with the outcomes of components A and B. This will also help sustain sector \nreforms  at  the  state  level  as  required  by  the  Electricity  Act  of  2003.  The  outputs  from \ncomponents  A  and  B  will  be  disseminated  through  national  and  regional  workshops  for \nstakeholders, including those in the private sector.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,100,000 equivalent, comprising $555,000 in \nforeign  exchange  cost  and  $545,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  cost.  ADB  will  finance \n$750,000 comprising $555,000 in foreign exchange cost and $195,000 in local currency cost. \nThe TA will be financed on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will \nfinance  the  remaining  $350,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  cost.  TA  cost  estimates  are \npresented in Appendix 3. The Government has been advised that approval of the TA does not \ncommit ADB to finance any ensuing investment projects. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  The  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA  will  be  MDONER.  A  senior  staff  member  from \nMDONER will be appointed as the project director. A project management office (PMO) will be \nestablished at MDONER in Delhi and a field representative will be designated in the NER.10 The \nPMO will be responsible for the day-to-day management of the TA and will coordinate with all \ngovernment  (including  state  and  local  governments)  and  nongovernment  stakeholders.  In \nconsultation with relevant agencies, the PMO will facilitate all TA-related workshops, meetings, \nand  field  visits  of  consultants  and  ADB  representatives.  An  advisory  committee  will  be \nestablished to provide strategic directions to the TA and preparation activities for the ensuing \ninvestment project. The advisory committee will include representatives from MOP, MDONER, \nNEC, the Brahmaputra Board, and other agencies as deemed appropriate and necessary by the \nGovernment and ADB. A PMO office will also be established to facilitate the ensuing loan-\nprocessing activities. \n \n                                                 \n10  Possibly at the NEC office in Shillong or Guwahati.

The consulting team will be selected and engaged through a \nfirm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, and other procedures \nacceptable to ADB for selection and engagement of domestic consultants. Simplified technical \nproposal format and the quality- and cost-based selection method will be used. For Phase I, the \nconsulting team will comprise international experts in (i) power policy and systems analysis and \n(ii) energy resource assessment. For Phase II, the consulting team will include international \nexperts in (i) power engineering, (ii) geological and geotechnical engineering, (iii) financial \nanalysis, (iv) energy economics, (v) environmental assessment, and (vi) social analysis. The \ndomestic experts will include (i) an institutional development specialist, (ii) a tariff analyst, (iii) an \nelectrical engineer, (iv) a resettlement and social development specialist, (v) a poverty reduction \nspecialist, (vi) a financial management specialist and financial analyst, (vii) a power sector \nspecialist,  (viii)  a  power  economist  and  policy  specialist,  (ix)  a  geology  and  geotechnical \nspecialist, and (x) an environment specialist. The power engineer or energy economist will be \nthe team leader and will coordinate the work of all consultants. The terms of reference for the \nconsultants are in Appendix 4.  \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 6 months, from February to August 2005.11 \nThe team leader will submit an inception report within 1 month commencement of services. An \ninterim report will be submitted 3 months after TA commencement, and a draft final report after \n5 months. The Government and ADB will provide their comments about 2 weeks after receipt of \nthese reports. Review meetings will include stakeholders, to ensure maximum local inputs and \nownership.  A  comprehensive  approach  will  be  developed  to  ensure  a  higher  level  of \nconsultation and participation by various stakeholders. The draft final report will be finalized at \nthe end of 6 months, after incorporating comments from the Government and ADB. There are \nno major risks associated with the TA, and the Government has expressed its strong support.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n   \nSector identified as a national priority in country  Sector identified as a national priority in \npoverty analysis?  Yes  country poverty partnership agreement?  Yes \n   \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in India:  \n \nThe North Eastern Region (NER) is one of the poorest regions in India, despite its considerable natural \nresources (water, gas, coal and oil, among others), and its strategic location, bordering countries in both \nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the  South Asian Association for Regional \nCooperation (SAARC). Limited access to basic infrastructure facilities and services, economic insularity, \npolitical instability, and lack of both connections within the region and private investment are the main \ncauses of the NER\u2019s high level of poverty.  \n \nThis TA is meant to draw a map of NER\u2019s energy resources to guide the financing of the most urgently \nneeded power-related investments, which will, ultimately, help NER break out of the present unsustainable \neconomic conditions.  \n \nPower sector development, focused on generation and transmission, is a necessary step for the country\u2019s \ngrowth strategy. India is at present a net importer of energy. Power sector development is particularly \ncritical in the NER. Given the region\u2019s unique socioeconomic conditions, the TA needs to be exceptionally \nthorough and detailed to support sustainable investments that lead to an optimal power system.  \n \nPower development in the NER can help the region to develop cottage industries and provide jobs for \nwomen. It can also bring income to the states. The local population will benefit both directly and indirectly: \n(i) directly, by having access to electricity for both private and productive consumption\u2014with positive \nimpacts on employment and labor productivity; (ii) indirectly, through the increased income generation by \nlocal authorities, which will be able to provide improved services. \n \nFinally, NER\u2019s power generation and transmission capacity can provide the region with the power needed \nto develop economically.  \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Proposed  Targeting  Classification:  General \nIntervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nThe NER is a region with both a very high prevalence of poverty and a unique social dimension. To better \nunderstand the Project\u2019s impact on poverty and society, the TA will use local consultants to prepare a \nsocial impact assessment and a poverty impact assessment. It is important to note that the number of \nperson-months devoted to poverty and social issues reflects the relevance of these matters for the \nproject\u2019s success.  \n \nA  socioeconomic  survey  will  be  undertaken  to  provide  a  basis  for  the  assessments.  Analyses  of \nresettlement and indigenous people will be fundamental to the social assessment, although they will be \nundertaken separately from the poverty impact assessment. From the analysis, consultants will prepare \nland acquisition and resettlements plans, if required, and incorporate mitigation measures and their costs \ninto  the  project\u2019s  cost  estimates.  The  poverty impact assessment will include a poverty profile, an \nassessment of the impact of the proposed project on the poor, and quantified information on poor \nbeneficiaries.  Finally,  tariff,  willingness-to-pay,  and  affordability  analyses  will  also  be  undertaken to \nimprove understanding of the project\u2019s impacts on the poor. \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?  Yes, stakeholder analysis will be undertaken. A stakeholder analysis \nwill  be  particularly  relevant  because  of  the  unique  social  dimensions  and  strong  community-based \nparticipation in decision-making processes.  \n \nIs  there  a  participation  strategy?  Yes,  a  participation  strategy  will  be  devised  during  the  project \npreparatory TA stage.
