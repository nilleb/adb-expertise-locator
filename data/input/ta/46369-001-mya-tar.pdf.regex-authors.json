INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  Government  of  Myanmar  has  recently  stepped  up  efforts  to  strengthen  the \neducation sector, recognizing an educated population and workforce as essential for sustained \neconomic growth and poverty reduction. This is reflected in the government\u2019s critical decision in \nearly 2012 to embark on a comprehensive education sector review (CESR)\u2014the first rigorous \nand comprehensive assessment of the education sector in two decades\u2014to provide a basis for \nmore clearly identifying sector challenges, priorities, and strategic options. Led by the Ministry of \nEducation  (MOE)  coordinating  inputs  by  other  agencies  as  well  as  development  partner \norganizations (DPOs), the CESR will culminate in adoption of a costed education sector plan \n(CESP) document, as a unified framework for prioritized and sequenced investments by the \ngovernment and DPOs.1   \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been involved from the earliest stages of \nCESR conceptualization, including participation in a series of forums and working meetings to \ndevelop a joint plan for the CESR, which was approved by Myanmar\u2019s President on 4 July 2012. \nThe government has requested ADB to provide capacity development technical assistance (TA) \nto directly support the CESR, in coordination with support from other DPOs.2 In particular, within \nthe CESR, the government and DPOs have called on ADB to support analysis and planning for \npost-primary  education  (PPE)3\u2014as  most  DPOs  will  focus  on  primary,  pre-primary,  and \nnonformal  education\u2014along  with  facilitation  of  access  to  relevant  regional  experience.  In \naddition  to  building  the  analytical  and  planning capacity  of  the  MOE  and  other  agencies4 \nthrough their involvement in CESR analyses, the TA will support applied capacity development \nactivities to build the analytical and planning capacities of these agencies. The TA impact, \noutcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost estimates and financing arrangements, \nand  terms  of  reference  for  initial  consultants  were  agreed  at  TA  fact-finding  during                       \n27 August\u20133 September 2012. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Important progress has been made in Myanmar\u2019s education sector in recent years, \nperhaps particularly in primary education (grades 1\u20135) where, despite persistent gaps and \nchallenges, the net enrollment ratio reached roughly 90% in school year (SY) 2009/10.6 At the \nsame time, progress has lagged in PPE subsectors, with net enrollment ratio estimates for the \nsecondary education subsector (SES) ranging from only 53.0% to 58.3%, and much lower for \ntechnical and vocational education and training (TVET) and the higher education subsector \n(HES).  More  generally,  despite  progress,  the  PPE  subsectors  appear  to  face  particular \nchallenges  in  key  aspects  of  equitable  access,  quality  and  relevance,  and  subsector \n                                                \n1   The 2-year CESR process will consist of three phases: (i) a roughly 6-month rapid assessment (phase 1), (ii) an \nadditional year of in-depth analysis (phase 2), and (iii) a final half year for CESP formulation (phase 3). The CESP \nwill include (i) a 2-year plan covering FY2014\u2013FY2015, and (ii) interim planning for education sector investments \nduring FY2016\u2013FY2020 and input into formulation of the national multisector Sixth Five-Year Plan. \n2   The Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) and United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) are \nleading overall DPO coordination in support of the CESR. \n3   PPE consists of the secondary education subsector (SES), technical and vocational education and training \n(TVET), and the higher education subsector (HES). \n4   The MOE formulates overall education sector policies, while 13 ministries are involved in HES (led by the MOE) \nand 10 in TVET, for which the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) is the lead agency, in coordination \nwith the MOE.  \n5  The concept paper for the TA was approved by the vice-president of Operations 2 on 30 August 2012.  The TA \nfirst appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 28 September 2012.  \n6   See also ADB. 2012. Initial Assessment of Post-Primary Education in Myanmar. Manila. This was prepared by \nADB staff (in dialogue with the MOE, other agencies, and DPOs) to inform ADB support to the joint CESR.      \n ", "2   \nmanagement. Limited available data suggest that gaps in each of these dimensions and their \nimpacts  on  PPE  subsector  performance  are  sizeable  (Appendix  2).  Alongside  continued \nprogress in primary and pre-primary education, the government has set strengthening of PPE \nas a high priority. As Myanmar embarks on dramatic socioeconomic transformations, PPE must \nplay a critical role in (i) promoting inclusive growth and poverty reduction, (ii) meeting rapidly \nevolving labor market needs, and (iii) rebalancing and equipping the economy to modernize and \nmove into higher value-added sectors and successfully enter into the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN) economic community in 2015 and global markets.  \n \n4.  At the same time, the dearth of data and information on the education sector (and \nparticularly  PPE  subsectors)  poses  a  key  challenge  for  the  MOE  and  other  agencies, \nobstructing concrete diagnoses of key problems and identification of effective interventions. \nCapacities for data analysis and evidence-based sector planning\u2014incorporating international \nexperience as well as improved national data\u2014also require strengthening. The CESR will thus \nbe  fundamentally  important  as  it  will  more  precisely  pinpoint  sector  (and  PPE  subsector) \nchallenges  and  provide  an  evidential  basis  for  identifying  needed  reforms,  defining  clear \npriorities and targets, and developing concrete and sequenced action plans. This process will \ncome to fruition with the government\u2019s development of an evidence-based and overarching \nCESP. This will provide a plan for sector improvement and ensure that increased financing \ntranslates into improved sector performance and contributions to Myanmar\u2019s socioeconomic \ntransformation. A number of DPOs have committed to align efforts to support the CESR. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n5.  The TA directly supports the government-led, DPO-supported CESR. Complementing \nsupport from other DPOs (largely focused on primary, pre-primary, and nonformal education), \nthe TA will focus principally on PPE. It will support foundational studies and linked capacity \ndevelopment  under  the  CESR\u2019s  phase  1  (rapid  assessment),  and  provide  flexible,  needs-\ntailored inputs during phases 2 and 3, leading up to government approval of the CESP.   \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n6.  The impact of the TA will be implementation of viable, sequenced, and adequately \nresourced  education  planning.  Its  outcome  will  be  a  strengthened  knowledge  base  and \ninstitutional capacity for PPE subsector planning. Integrated within the broader CESR process \nand closely linked to inputs from other DPOs, the TA will help to address key gaps in data and \ninformation as well as the capacity of the MOE and other agencies for evidence-based planning, \nsupporting formulation of the CESP as a unified plan for strengthening the education sector.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n7.  The  TA  will  center  on  three  outputs  related  to  PPE  subsector  studies,  regional \nexperience  sharing,  and  strengthening  analytical  and  planning  capacities.  To  ensure \nresponsiveness to government needs under the joint CESR and harmonization with support of \nother DPOs (both of which are expected to rapidly evolve), support under each output area will \nbe flexible and tailored to needs. While the TA design will specify initial sub-outputs (e.g., \nstudies) that directly support the CESR\u2019s initial rapid assessment phase (August 2012\u2013January \n2013), it will allow flexibility to program subsequent sub-outputs on a biannual basis, or as \n ", "  3 \nneeded, to ensure rapid response to government priorities as they emerge or are refined later in \nthe 2-year CESR process, which will culminate in CESP approval.7    \n \n8.  Output 1: Post-primary education subsector studies completed. The TA will support \nstudies in identified priority areas under the overall umbrella of the joint CESR. Three initial sub-\noutputs will conduct rapid assessments of the SES, TVET, and HES, with the following core \ndeliverables feeding directly into a compilation volume of CESR phase 1 studies: (i) a report on \nkey challenges facing the SES, as part of a larger cluster study on basic education (grades 1\u2013\n11); (ii) a report on labor market dynamics and implications for TVET and the HES; and (iii) a \nreport on HES service delivery. Each of these initial sub-outputs will be led by an international \nconsultant working closely with CESR Office staff and national consultants being mobilized by \nthe  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural  Organization  (UNESCO)  and  other \nDPOs. Identification and design of subsequent sub-outputs will be undertaken in late 2012, \nbased on emerging findings from CESR phase 1 analysis. In general, studies will (i) include \ndisaggregated  analysis,  including  to  the  extent  possible,  gender,  socioeconomic,  and \ngeographical  dimensions,  as  well  as  how  these  interact;  (ii)  assess  access,  quality  and \nrelevance, and subsector management aspects; and (iii) identify recommendations for policy \naction,  legislation,  program  improvements,  and  institutional  reforms  (including  improved \ncoordination mechanisms).8 Development of PPE-related elements of the CESP (during phase \n3 of the CESR) will directly integrate key findings from analysis supported under output 1, as \nwell as regional experience and lessons learned under output 2. \n \n9.  Output  2:  Regional  experience  and  lessons  disseminated  and  applied. \nComplementing  analysis  of  Myanmar\u2019s  PPE  subsectors  under  output  1,  the  TA  will  distill \nregional  experience  from  countries  with  similar  contexts,  with  a  focus  on  nearby  ADB \ndeveloping  member  countries  that  have  initiated  systematic  reforms  in  one  or  more  PPE \nsubsectors alongside similar socioeconomic transitions.9 While principally focused on PPE, the \nTA will support broader regional sharing of experience on sector-wide and crosscutting issues \n(e.g., developing member country policies on compulsory education and teacher education). \nDuring CESR phase 1 (rapid assessment), one initial sub-output will prepare and disseminate a \nshort, policy-relevant synthesis report on regional experience in the PPE subsectors, drawing on \nvarious resources including reports and project-related experience from ADB, the Australian \nAgency for  International  Development  (AusAID),  and  other  DPOs.10 A  small  workshop  will \nsupport  dissemination  and  dialogue  on  implications  for  Myanmar,  and  help  identify  more \ndetailed analysis of regional experience and models in priority areas. Subsequent sub-outputs \nsupporting CESR phases 2 and 3 will consist principally of desk-research-based comparative \nstudies  and  dissemination  workshops  (including  government  agencies,  DPOs,  and  other \nstakeholders),  but may  also  include  limited  support for  other forms  of  regional knowledge \nexchange, such as invitation of regional experts and practitioners to Myanmar.11   \n \n10.  Output 3: Analytical and planning capacities of key post-primary education related \nagencies  strengthened.  In  addition  to  \u2015learning  by  doing\u2016  under  output  1  and  related \nconsultant support, the TA will support focused, needs-tailored capacity development initiatives \n                                                \n7   Subsequent sub-outputs and TORs would be reviewed jointly by the MOE, ADB, and AusAID. Similar TA designs \nbeen very effective in ensuring responsiveness to rapidly evolving needs in several developing member countries.   \n8   Phase 1 studies will also inform the analytical agenda for more in-depth PPE-related analyses during phase 2. \n9   Regional experience and lessons shared will include gender-related challenges and responses; and identify \nrecommendations for future policy, programs, and capacity development initiatives in Myanmar.  \n10  In addition to TA consultant inputs, this sub-output will tap ADB\u2019s PPE subsector experience and AusAID\u2019s \nexperience in areas such as primary-to-lower-secondary transitions, TVET, and sister university partnerships.  \n11  Opportunities may also be explored to support participation of Myanmar officials in knowledge-exchange events in \nneighboring countries, particularly those in which ADB is supporting similar PPE reforms.   \n ", "4   \ntargeted at senior officials and CESR  Office staff from  the MOE, Ministry of Science and \nTechnology (MOST), and other agencies involved in PPE.12 Activities will be coordinated with \nsupport from other DPOs (para. 11) to ensure that support is consistent and complementary. To \nsupport the post-secondary education (TVET and HES) cluster under CESR phase 1, the initial \nsub-output will support a capacity building seminar to support data collection and analysis for \nstaff of the MOE, MOST, and other ministries and institutions.13 A stock-taking exercise late in \nCESR  phase  1  will  identify  priority  capacity  gaps  for  support  under  subsequent  capacity \ndevelopment sub-outputs (as well as ongoing consultant support), in order to support PPE-\nrelated analysis and CESP formulation during CESR phases 2 and 3, and looking to CESP \nimplementation.  More  focused  activities  will  support  PPE  subsector  decision  makers  in \nresponding to specific priority issues. Sub-outputs will integrate gender dimensions, including \nseeking to build capacities of PPE-related agencies in gender-related analysis and planning. \n \n11.  Cross-cutting aspects. All three outputs will involve close coordination and in some \ncases direct collaboration with other DPOs, particularly those involved in the PPE subsectors\u2014\nprincipally  UNESCO  (particularly  for  TVET  and  HES),  GIZ  (for  TVET),  and  the  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency (expected to support CESR work focused on engineering \nfields). A knowledge plan (to be jointly formulated early in the TA and updated periodically) will \nprovide an overall framework for report dissemination, knowledge sharing workshops, and other \ninterventions. In addition to more detailed study reports under outputs 1 and 2, deliverables for \neach sub-output will include a synopsis monograph. Focused synopses, to be disseminated in \nEnglish  and  Myanmar  languages,  will  be  self-contained  and  provide  a  selective  summary \nfocusing on distilling the key policy-relevant issues and recommendations.14  \n \n12.   The risk of a reversal in Myanmar\u2019s political and socioeconomic policy reforms appears \nsmall (with recent parliamentary elections pointing to growing momentum), as does risk of a \ndeprioritization of education sector development and the CESR, which is fully government-\nowned and supported from the highest levels (para. 2). Multi-stakeholder coordination and \ninstitutional capacities among the multiple ministries involved may pose challenges. However, \nthe education sector has thus far stood out as a leading example of coordination, while the \nCESR\u2019s phased approach, mechanisms for multi-stakeholder engagement,15 and DPO support \nfor capacity development will help support effective implementation.16   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $720,000 equivalent, of which (i) $200,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources); and (ii) \n$370,000 equivalent will be financed on a grant basis by the Government of Australia and \nadministered by ADB.17 The Government of Myanmar will provide counterpart support in the \nform of counterpart staff, office accommodation and supplies, meeting venues, administrative \nsupport, and other in-kind contributions. The TA will finance (i) expert inputs (para. 15); (ii) \n                                                \n12  Several DPOs are mobilizing consultants, including two full-time international advisors providing overall process \nmanagement support to the MOE and the CESR Office, as well as training, other capacity building, and other \nsupport for the CESR, with an overall focus on primary, pre-primary, and nonformal education.    \n13   Supported by the TA consultants, the seminar will be conducted jointly with UNESCO and Deutsche Gesellschaft \nf\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), with participation by other DPOs interested in specific focal areas. \n14  These  include  identification  of  gaps  and  recommendations  related  to  policy  and  legislation,  operational \n \nmechanisms, and/or implementation capacities.    \n15  These include the joint education sector working group consisting of government agencies and DPOs. \n16  Any minor equipment is expected to be procured by ADB-recruited consultants. ADB staff will provide the MOE \nand other participating agencies with further orientation regarding various aspects of TA administration.  \n17  Funds will be provided on a front-loaded basis. AusAID counterparts have also noted that they will explore the \npossibility of providing additional resources for the TA as part of AusAID's programming exercise for 2013. \n ", "  5 \nworkshops and knowledge-exchange activities, including costs related to resource persons, \nvenue, equipment rental, translation, printing and copying, food and nonalcoholic beverages, \ntransportation and lodging, logistics, and administration support; (iii) resource materials and \nminor computer equipment, and other costs related to surveys, field investigations, and data \nentry; and (iv) other allowable expenditures as agreed by ADB.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  The MOE will be the executing agency. The TA will be implemented from October 2012 \nto October 2014.18 To support harmonization and coordination across elements of the CESR \nand DPO support, the CESR Office will act as implementing agency for the TA, supporting day-\nto-day implementation and coordination across related agencies and DPOs.19 The government \nestablished the CESR Office to coordinate the overall CESR process. Full-time staff seconded \nfrom the MOE and other agencies20 are supported by two long-term international advisors and \nother shorter-term consultants funded by other DPOs.   \n \n15.  The TA will support indicatively 18.0 person-months of international consultants and 18.0 \nperson-months of national consultants, who will have expertise in the SES, TVET, and/or HES \nand will be recruited as individuals and engaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Terms of reference and key \ndeliverables for three consultants supporting phase 1 sub-outputs are in Appendix 4.21 The TA \nwill also flexibly mobilize short-term resource persons to provide specific expertise, as needed. \nWhile not reflected in the cost estimates, ADB and AusAID staff with expertise in the SES, \nTVET, and HES will be directly involved in TA implementation, including in identifying new sub-\noutputs and reviewing draft reports, as well as development (early in the TA) of the noted \nknowledge  plan (para. 11).22 Support  under the TA  will  be  linked  with  inputs  provided  by \nUNESCO  (particularly  for  TVET  and  HES),  GIZ  (for  TVET),  and  the  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency (expected to support CESR work focused on engineering fields). More \nbroadly, continuous dialogue will be maintained with national and DPO stakeholders through the \nCESR Office, joint education sector working group, and other coordination mechanisms.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $370,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of Australia, and (ii) ADB providing the balance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $200,000 on a grant basis, to the Government of Myanmar for \nSupport for Education Sector Planning, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n                                                \n18  Within the MOE, the Department of Education Planning and Training acts as the focal point of the CESR as well \nas for broader coordination across ministries and departments and cooperation with DPOs. \n19  A CESR steering committee will support higher-level policy dialogue and coordination related to the CESR. \n20  These include four full-time staff from the MOE and MOST to support HES and TVET studies (two each), while \nother CESR Office staff will partially focus on the SES under the broader basic education (grades 1\u201311) cluster.    \n21  Three international consultants will have a total input of 8.0 person-months. Pending review, consultants will \nadminister  TA-funded  procurements  and  workshop  expenses.  In  all  cases,  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time), Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from \ntime to time), and other ADB guidelines shall be applied. Equipment (indicatively two laptop computers and one \ndigital camera) will be turned over to MOE after TA completion. \n22  ADB staff involvement is strongly justified given the importance of continued relationship-building with government \nagencies and DPOs involved in the education sector, and as part of ADB\u2019s broader reengagement in Myanmar. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary \nIndicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nViable,  By end of 2017:   MOE reports   No major reversal or \nsequenced, and  CESP subplan for 2014\u20132016  disruption of political, \nSixth Five-Year Plan for \nadequately  successfully completed, with  economic, and social \nNational Development \nresourced  achievements monitored  policy reforms \nand related documents  \neducation planning     \nimplemented  Education sector planning  Disaggregated national  Government \nunder the 2016\u20132021 portion  budget figures  prioritization of \nof the CESP incorporated in  education sector \nand commenced under the  development \nFive-Year Plan for National  maintained or increased \nDevelopment, 2016\u20132021   \nTotal government \nrevenues continue rapid \ngrowth  \nOutcome  By October 2014:    Assumption \nStrengthened  Compilation volumes  CESR phase 1 and   \nknowledge base  prepared for each of phase 1  phase 2 compilation  PPE studies and \nand institutional  and phase 2 of the joint  volumes disseminated  recommendations \ncapacity for PPE  CESR process incorporate  by MOE   endorsed by CESR \nsubsector planning  high-quality, timely analysis of    Task Force and senior \n  SES, TVET, and HES  Consolidated CESR  officials \n  progress reports    \nAnalytical and planning    Risk \ncapacities of MOE, MOST,  Annual reports of MOE, \nBreakdown of \nand other agencies involved  MOST, and other \ncoordination \nin PPE strengthened, as  agencies \nmechanisms for CESR, \nreflected in the approved \nwhich spans multiple \nCESP and mechanisms in \nagencies and DPOs  \nplace for implementation of \n \nPPE-related elements \nOutputs  By October 2014:    Assumptions \n1.

This appendix provides a summary of key challenges facing post-primary education \n(PPE) in Myanmar, distilling findings from an initial analysis of available data and information \nconducted by Asian Development Bank (ADB) staff\u2014in dialogue with the Ministry of Education \n(MOE), other agencies, and development partner organizations (DPOs)\u2014to inform ADB support \nto the joint comprehensive education sector review (CESR). That initial analysis pointed to \nimportant  achievements  made  in  the  secondary  education  subsector  (SES),  technical  and \nvocational education and training (TVET) and the higher education subsector (HES). However, \nfor brevity, the summary below focuses on key challenges in these PPE subsectors. \n \n2.  Gaps in access. While total enrollments in middle school (grades 6\u20139) and high school \n(grades  10\u201311)  grew  at  annual  rates  of  3.6%  and  1.6%  respectively  during  SY2000/01\u2013\nSY2007/08,  they  subsequently  decelerated,  with  a  sizeable  decline  in  total  high  school \nenrollment  during  SY2007/08\u2013SY2010/11.  Household  surveys  suggest  that  nearly  half  of \nsecondary school-aged children are out of school. Exit from school is particularly marked at the \ntransition from primary to middle school: cohort-based analysis suggest that one in four primary \nschool  completers  never  enter  middle  school,  despite  some  signs  of  progress.  Moreover, \naggregate figures conceal sizeable geographic and socioeconomic gaps, and such disparities \nappear much larger in SES than at the primary level.1 While aggregate figures show strong \ngender parity overall, girls in poor families, remote rural areas, and some ethnic groups may be \nparticularly disadvantaged, i.e., the influences of gender and other socioeconomic dimensions \nare interlinked.2 Expansion of \u2015post-primary schools\u2016 (adding early middle school grades at \nexisting primary school sites) has helped expand access, but key issues remain, particularly in \npoor  and  ethnic  areas.  These  include  (i)  disparities  in  completion  rates  and  levels  of \npreparedness from the primary level; (ii) demand-side factors such as financial and opportunity \ncosts, language and other cultural factors, and disabilities; and (iii) supply-side factors such as \ngaps in school networks in remote areas, financial and human resources, and quality.  \n \n3.  Data is more limited for TVET and HES, but points to rising numbers of institutions and \nstudents.3 Females  constitute  at  least  60%  of  HES  enrollments,  but  appear  to  be  under \nrepresented in TVET.4 At the same time, while data is limited, there likely remain sizeable \ndisparities in access to TVET and HES by socioeconomic and ethnic groups, including due to \ndirect and indirect costs. For TVET (which also includes a smaller number of programs at the \nsecondary level), a key priority appears to be expanding access to relevant quality skills training \nand upgrading opportunities for workers and unemployed and underemployed youth (including \nschool leavers) and adults from poorer rural areas.5 For HES, another major issue is the inability \n                                                \n1 Based on household surveys cited in the noted initial assessment, 52.4% of 10- to 15-year-olds from households in \nthe poorest wealth quintile are already out-of-school (versus only 9.5% for the richest quintile). \n2 An estimated 55.8% of 10- to 15-year-old girls in the poorest quintile of households are out-of-school (versus 48.8% \nfor boys), with similar figures for girls and boys in Rakhine state. Mothers\u2019 education appears especially important \nfor girls\u2019 schooling. \n3 HES has expanded dramatically, from 32 institutions and 131,837 undergraduate and higher-level students in \nSY1997/98 to 163 institutions (under 13 ministries) and 510,891 students in SY2011/12.   \n4 Ten ministries offer TVET programs, with the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) as overall lead. The gap \nin labor force participation between females (63%) and males (85%) also in part likely reflects issues related to \naccess to high quality and relevant skill training, as well as issues related to gender norms within and beyond PPE.  \n5 TVET expansion and system strengthening appears a high priority for promoting fully inclusive growth. The vast \nmajority of the labor force requires improved skills to increase productivity: a difficult task given that more than 90% \nof workers nationwide appear to be engaged in agriculture and/or working in the informal sector or self-employed.  \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \nof two-thirds of high school completers to pass the matriculation exam (para. 4), which also pre-\nselects passers into fields of study. \n \n4.  Gaps in quality and relevance. There is a particular lack of systematic data relating to \nPPE quality and relevance, but anecdotal evidence suggests challenges in terms of teaching \n(still  largely  rote-based)  and  learning  outcomes.  Available  SES  data  suggest  that  grade \nrepetition is rather modest, but rises in the final year of middle school (grade 9), becoming \nespecially problematic in high school (grades 10\u201311). Combined with high matriculation exam \nfailure rates, this suggests problems in students\u2019 mastery of subject content.6 Priorities identified \nfor the CESR include (i) a systematic review of detailed curricula and teaching materials used in \nSES, approaches to student assessment, and the use of English for teaching high school math \nand sciences; (ii) strengthening of SES teacher training and support, to encourage a shift from \nrote-based to student-centered learning, as well as teacher deployment and broader human \nresource  issues;  (iii)  investment  in  facilities  and  materials  for  teaching  and  learning;  and           \n(iv) efforts to address equity and quality concerns arising from private tuition (e.g., for-fee \ntutoring).  \n \n6.  To  ensure  that  TVET  and  HES  effectively  support  Myanmar\u2019s  socioeconomic \ntransformation, both subsectors will need to introduce more fully competency-based curricula \nand address gaps in (i) relevance of curricula and materials, methodology, and overall program \ndesign to shifting demands, and alignment across TVET, HES, and SES; (ii) quality control and \naccreditation, particularly given a proliferation of institutions and programs of varying quality;           \n(iii) faculty qualifications and professional support systems; and (iv) links to labor market needs, \nespecially in emerging sectors and skill areas. For TVET, the CESR will be critical in providing \nthe first in-depth review of the subsector, with priorities including (i) streamlining TVET and \nenhancing quality and relevance; (ii) developing an updated policy framework for TVET and \noccupational competency standards and qualification frameworks; and (iii) bolstering related \ncapacities  of  the  National  Skills  Standard  Authority  and  other  institutions.  HES-specific \nchallenges  include  the  need  to  (i)  overhaul  the  matriculation  exam  and  HES  student \nassessment; (ii) review the use of English to teach math and sciences; (iii) enhance applied \nresearch capacity; and (iv) expand international linkages. \n \n6.  Gaps in subsector management. Inadequate financing remains an overarching issue \nfor the education sector. The new government\u2019s redoubled focus on education appears to be \ntranslating into increased resourcing: the FY2012 budget for education more than doubled in \nnominal terms, with the share of an increasing total national budget allocated to education rising \nfrom 3.74% to 6.26%, though this remains very low by international standards.7 While DPO \nsupport  will  likely  increase,  continued  increases  in  (and  careful  prioritization  and  effective \nmanagement of) state financing for education will be critical. Detailed analysis under the CESR \nis needed to pinpoint and address other key gaps in sector management that interlink with \naccess and quality issues, undermining education sector performance. Many of these appear \nmost pronounced in PPE, including gaps related to (i) coordination across multiple ministries \nand MOE departments; (ii) data and information to inform policy, planning, and budgeting;       \n(iii) overall institutional capacity; (iv) human resources and technical and managerial capacities; \n(v) systems for assessing teachers and faculty and learning outcomes, as well as broader \nquality control; and (vi) new frameworks for private TVET and HES institutions.8   \n                                                \n6 Taken at the end of grade 11, this exam is currently the basis for both certification of high school completion and \nselection into HES programs. In SY2009/10, 61.3% of test takers failed, undermining the benefits of high school.     \n7 The share of the education budget in GDP is expected to double from 0.69% to a projected value of 1.4%\u20131.5%. \n8 Starting in SY2012/13, MOE plans to allow registration of private schools, but only for grades 1\u201311.  \n ", "10   Appendix 3   \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($'000) \n \n  Total \nItem  Cost \nA.

The technical assistance (TA) will mobilize international and national experts to support \nanalyses, workshops, and other agreed sub-output activities under the umbrella of Myanmar\u2019s \ncomprehensive  education  sector  review  (CESR),  including  by  providing  international  best \npractice, in-depth local knowledge, support for capacity development initiatives, and/or policy-\nrelated advice to the CESR. Expert inputs will consist of (i) individual consultants, to be recruited \nby the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in dialogue with the Ministry of Education (MOE) and \nother  agencies  involved  in  post-primary  education  (PPE) 1  work  under  the  CESR;  and                \n(ii) resource persons needed to provide focused, short-term inputs (up to 10 working days \nmaximum).  Expert  inputs  will  be  coordinated  with  the  CESR  Office\u2014set  up  to  support \ncoordination across all aspects of the CESR, which will include support from many development \npartner organizations (DPOs)\u2014and harmonized with inputs from other DPOs. To ensure timely \nand effective response to evolving government needs and DPO support linked to the CESR, the \nflexible design of the TA specifies five initial sub-outputs (e.g., studies) that directly support the \nCESR\u2019s initial rapid assessment phase (August 2012\u2013January 2013), allowing subsequent sub-\noutputs to be added during phases 2 and 3 of the 2-year CESR process.   \n \n2.  This  document  provides  outline  terms  of  reference  for  three  initial  international \nconsultants2 (totaling 8.0 person-months, on an intermittent basis) whose inputs will focus on \nsupporting rapid assessment work3 on the PPE subsectors under CESR phase 1.4 It also \nprovides a general framework for mobilization of other experts during TA implementation, with \nspecific terms of reference for new sub-outputs to be agreed jointly with the MOE (as TA \nexecuting  agency)  and  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID).  As \napplicable, such dialogue will also include the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) \nand/or other agencies and institutions, as needed (particularly for TVET and the HES). Inclusive \nof  the  initial  consultants,  it  is  expected  that  the  TA  will  finance  18.0  person-months  of \ninternational  consultant  inputs,  18.0  person-months  of  national  consultant  inputs,  and  200 \nworking days of resource person inputs.5 \n \n3.  Within 2 weeks of fielding, consultants will propose a detailed work plan, based on \ndiscussion with the CESR Office and CESR teams working on various cluster studies to ensure \ncoordination and a clear division of labor. Additionally, early in the TA, ADB, AusAID, the MOE, \nand other relevant agencies will develop a knowledge plan (to be updated periodically, as \nneeded) to provide an overall framework for reports, workshops, and other knowledge sharing \nand dissemination interventions under various sub-outputs. In general, for each sub-output, a \ndesignated international consultant will take lead responsibility for drafting either or both of the \nfollowing written deliverables:6 (i) for analytical work under outputs 1 and 2, a sub-output final \n                                                \n1 PPE consists of the secondary education subsector (SES), technical and vocational education and training (TVET), \nand the higher education subsector (HES). \n2 These consultants will have a strong background in one or more relevant PPE subsectors, including considerable \nexperience in contextually similar countries, and preferably including similar sector review processes. \n3 In terms of quantitative analysis, the consultants will principally utilize data being collected and/or compiled by the \nCESR Office under a data-related cluster study (supported by other DPOs) early in phase 1, but will conduct site \nvisits to a limited number of representative institutions and areas as needed (also to support qualitative analysis). \n4 Pending review for CESR phases 2 and 3, consultants will administer TA-funded procurements and workshop \nexpenses for phase 1.   \n5 The TA may also finance travel-related costs and/or other out-of-pocket expenses (but not honoraria, overheads, \netc.) for staff of government ministries or those of other entities partnering in specific sub-outputs.   \n6 These will incorporate inputs from TA-funded resource persons and distill material from relevant existing work. \n ", "12  Appendix 4 \n \n \nreport  outlining  the  key  methodology,  processes,  and  results;7 and  (ii)  for  all  sub-outputs, \nEnglish  and  Myanmar-language  versions  of  a  concise,  self-contained  focused  synopsis \nmonograph,8 supported by salient evidence or examples from Myanmar and (as appropriate) \ninternational  cases,  and  typically  targeted  at  mid-level  officials  in  relevant  ministries  and \n(secondarily) DPOs and broader stakeholders.9 In general, analysis and reports should assess \naccess, quality and relevance, and subsector management aspects. They should also include \ndisaggregated  analysis,  giving  due  emphasis  to  gender,  socioeconomic,  and  geographical \ndimensions, and how these interact.10 Capacity development support (including sub-outputs \nunder output 3, and informal mentoring for government counterparts) should also consider such \ndimensions.    \n \n1.  Secondary Education Specialist (international, 3.0 person-months) \n \n4.  The specialist will work with the MOE and the CESR Office to carry out SES-related \naspects of the CESR phase 1 cluster study on basic education.11 Based on an agreed division \nof labor (to be reconfirmed prior to commencement), the specialist will work in coordination and \ncooperation with experts (including those funded by other DPOs) working on other aspects of \nthat cluster study and other relevant analyses under the CESR. Focused largely (but not solely) \non sub-output 1.1, specific tasks will include the following, as well as any others that may be \nreasonably requested by ADB or the MOE (para. 3): \n \n(i)  In coordination with the CESR Office and the team working on quantitative data \ncompilation,  take  the  lead  in  conducting  an  initial  analysis  of  disaggregated \ntrends and factors underlying low primary-to-secondary transition (despite lower \nsecondary  expansion),  intrasecondary  transition  (including  dropout  and \nrepetition), and related issues. Identify existing and potential priority remedial \nmeasures (e.g., stipends and remedial support). \n(ii)  Identify and appraise legislation and policy.12 Support the MOE and the CESR \nbasic education working group in assessing the existing \u20155+4+2\u2016 cycle structure \nof primary and secondary education, and conduct an interim curriculum review.13  \n(iii)  Appraise current arrangements for learner assessment in SES, including policy \nand mechanisms for external student assessment through standardized tests \nand examinations (including review of current matriculation examination).14 \n(iv)  Linked to  and  complementing  another  CESR  study  on  grade 1\u201311 textbook \ndistribution, review content of and student access to existing textbooks. \n                                                \n7   This should include assessment and provision of concrete recommendations for follow-up analysis under the \nCESR (particularly for sub-output early in the TA) and/or potential policy refinements or reforms. An executive \nsummary will be provided in English and Myanmar languages. \n8   This  will  principally  focus  on  distilling  key  issues  (e.g.,  gaps  in  policy,  operational  mechanisms,  and/or \nimplementation capacities) and recommendations (e.g., proposed reforms and/or operational mechanisms, or \nactionable lessons learned from capacity building approaches and recommendations for future interventions).   \n9   For outputs 1 and 2, focused synopses (expected to be around 10 pages long) may share some content with final \nreport executive summaries but should be more operationally focused. For output 3, focused synopses may be \nshorter but will annex resource materials to support related future activities. \n10  All studies are expected to include collection of sex-disaggregated data, gender analysis, and gender-related \nrecommendations (in addition to location and ethnic group dimensions). \n11  This study will be conducted by the CESR Office with support from the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), \nAusAID, and other DPOs. \n12  This will include levels and categories of SES schools and responsibilities of different agencies, including policy \nfor different types of public and private secondary schools. \n13  This includes SES curricular mapping; links to primary, TVET, and HES curricula; and labor market relevance.  \n14  This will take into account the government\u2019s reform priority to change the assessment and evaluation system and \ndevelop a National Qualification Framework and a National Accreditation Body.  \n ", "  Appendix 4  13 \n(v)  Assess broader links with primary and post-secondary education subsectors. \n(vi)  Support the CESR Office and other experts under the basic education team in \nassessing  broader  and  crosscutting  issues  affecting  the  SES  and  other \nsubsectors15 based on an agreed division of labor.  \n(vii)  For sub-output 2.1 of the TA, incorporate focused inputs from other consultants, \ncompile existing information, prepare a desk review paper to help disseminate \ninternational  experiences  and  models  most  relevant  to  the  current  PPE \ndevelopment context in Myanmar, and finalize this following a small workshop.  \n(viii)  In coordination with the other consultants, provide related inputs to the initial \ncapacity building seminar under sub-output 3.1, to be jointly conducted with the \nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and \nDeutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ).

Analysis will also identify \nmore general implications for the SES.   \n17  In addition to staff inputs, under a separate regional TA project ADB is mobilizing the services of a TVET service \ndelivery specialist, and an HES policy specialist. In addition, GIZ and UNESCO plan to mobilize additional staff \nand consultancy inputs, based on an agreed division of labor.    \n18  This includes institutional mandates and responsibilities at national and local levels, and related capacity issues. \n19  These include cash-for-work, youth employment, and community employment programs, with a particular focus \non poor out-of-school youth and/or disadvantaged groups. \n20  These include incubators, credit schemes, self-employment programs, and business registration support. \n ", "14  Appendix 4 \n \n \n(vi)  Document functions and responsibilities of major labor-related (e.g., employer \nand  employee  associations,  industry  groups,  and  chambers  of  commerce). \nAssess existing networks and relationships between industry and HES and TVET \ninstitutions to inform TVET and HES delivery. \n(vii)  Assess  the  quantity  and  relevance  of  HES  and  TVET  programs,  and  skills \ntraining and retraining opportunities for adults in relation to current and future \nlabor market needs.21  \n(viii)  Prepare  mapping  of  current  and  planned  activities  and  strategies  of  DPOs \nrelated to the labor market, TVET, and HES. \n(ix)  Incorporating the above, prepare the following two reports, to be finalized after \nmultistakeholder review: (a) a full-length report on labor market dynamics and \nimplications for TVET and the HES,22 and (b) a related focused synopsis.23   \n(x)  Under  sub-outputs  2.1  and  3.1,  provide  related  inputs  to  the  paper  on \ninternational experience and initial capacity building seminar.
