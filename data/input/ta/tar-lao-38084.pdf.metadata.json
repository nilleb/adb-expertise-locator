During the Mission of 23 September\u20133 October 2003 to prepare the project preparatory \ntechnical  assistance  (PPTA)  for  the  Participatory  Livestock  Development  Project  (PLDP),  the \nimportance of building the capacity of key national, provincial, and district officers who will likely be \ninvolved in the ensuing project was identified. Following this Mission, a concept paper on Capacity \nBuilding  for  Smallholder  Livestock  was  prepared  and  submitted  to  the  Poverty  Reduction \nCooperation Fund (PRF) for funding consideration.  The concept paper was endorsed at the \nstrategy meeting of the Cooperation Fund in Support of the formulation and implementation of \nNational Poverty Reduction Strategies (NPRS Fund) and the PRF in January 2004. Subsequently, \na Mission to Vientiane and Xiengkhuang was undertaken during 20\u201321 April 2004 to formulate the \ntechnical assistance (TA).  The Mission met representatives from the Government, key external \nfunding agencies, and other stakeholders to discuss the TA objectives, scope, and implementation \narrangements.1 The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The contribution of agriculture to the gross domestic product is approximately 52%, of \nwhich livestock and fisheries contribute 18%.  An estimated 85% of the population depend on the \nagriculture  and  forestry  sector  for  their  livelihood,  with  most  practicing  subsistence  farming.  \nRaising livestock is a particularly important activity for smallholders and poor farmers who produce \nabout 95% of total livestock in the country. Livestock is a means of accumulating capital, acts as a \nsocial safety net, provides draft power, and has ceremonial significance for many ethnic groups.  It \naccounts for approximately 50% of cash income in many upland and highland community areas. \nThe importance of livestock was confirmed through ADB\u2019s participatory poverty assessment  (PPA) \nundertaken in 2000.   \n \n3.    Loss of livestock is a serious issue.  It is attributed to high animal mortality rates from \ndiseases, improper nutrition, and inappropriate animal husbandry practices.  It has been estimated \nthat as much as 80% of chickens in upland villages die every year, mortality rate of buffalo calves \ndue to parasites is 30\u201340%, and disease epidemics among pigs may result in the death of most \nanimals.2  Such loss is one of the main causes of poverty. During the PPA, 70% of farmers \ninterviewed identified livestock issues as a major problem.   \n \n4.    Lessons learned from past and ongoing projects supporting the livestock sector underscore \nthe  importance,  among  others,  of  providing  an  integrated  set  of  new  technologies  and \nmanagement practices, and encouraging their adaptation and adoption by farmers. An effective \nparticipatory approach is required to reach (i) farmers, particularly women who are the main \ncaretakers of livestock and provide much of the required labor and time inputs; and (ii) ethnic \nminorities whose cultural and language differences can inhibit information access and adoption of \nnew technology and management practices.  Past and ongoing projects commonly identify the \nlimited availability of experienced counterpart staff, particularly at the provincial and district levels, \nas a major challenge (footnote 2). This constraint is attributed to limited opportunities to apply \nknowledge gained through training workshops, and Government budgetary pressures on staffing. \nShortage of staff experienced in working with disadvantaged groups, including ethnic minorities \nand women, is significant.  \n \n5.    While capacity building is a major component of many projects and programs, the training \nsupport  is  often  a  one-time  event  that  is  not  necessarily  targeted  to  staff  responsibilities.  \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 16 April 2004. \n2 ADB. 2002. Review of the Livestock Sector in Lao People's Democratic Republic. Manila.  ", "2 \nMoreover, the projects and programs provide limited follow-up support to help trainees apply and \nuse the information as springboards to develop new skills and knowledge, in their normal work \ncontext.  A preliminary institutional capacity assessment concluded that staff of the Provincial \nAgriculture Forestry Office and District Agriculture Forestry Office will benefit from (i) increased \ntechnical knowledge and relevant field experience in addressing livestock management issues, \nand (ii) strengthened social skills and orientation in effectively consulting with farmers of diverse \ncultural  background.  The  Forages  and  Livestock  Systems  Project  (FLSP)  of  the  National \nAgriculture and Forestry Research Institute (NAFRI) and supported by the International Center for \nTropical Agriculture (CIAT) is the only project that focuses on training of provincial and district \nofficers  in  participatory  approaches  to  promote  adaptation  and  adoption  of  technologies  and \nmanagement practices by farmers, and supports its application to real work situations.   \n \n6.    Accordingly, the TA will build on the FLSP experience to enhance the quality and outreach \nof  livestock  development  services,  particularly  to  the  socially  disadvantaged  groups  including \nethnic  minorities  and  women  farmers.  The  PPTA  aims  to  help  the  Government  establish  an \neffective and participatory livestock service system, focusing on poor districts in the northern \nregion. The participatory approach is expected to strengthen interactions between provincial and \ndistrict staff and farmers to diagnose and identify key constraints, and consider options to address \nthe issues. It will build farmers\u2019 analytical and decision-making capacity to apply options to improve \nlivestock productivity.  As a first step, it is critical that national, provincial, and district staff have \nappropriate technical, social, and managerial skills and experience. The TA will work mainly with \nGovernment staff, but will also try to involve private providers, given that local governments have \ndifficulty  in  fully  responding  to  the  demand  for  livestock  services  with  its  staff  and  budget \nconstraints.   \n \n7.    The TA is in line with the national growth and poverty eradication strategy (NGPES), which \nemphasizes  \u201ccommunity-driven  and  access-oriented\u201d  rural  development.  NGPES  considers \naddressing livestock disease and productivity issues as a priority for the poor. The TA supports the \nGovernment\u2019s Strategic Vision for the Agriculture Sector (December 1999), which emphasizes \ncommunity participation; and the Government\u2019s Socioeconomic Development Plan 2001\u20132005, \nwhich emphasizes livestock development as one of the poverty reduction measures.  The Poverty \nReduction Partnership Agreement between the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) and \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) includes cooperation in improving agriculture productivity \nthrough, among other areas, livestock as important for poverty reduction.   \n \n8.    The PPTA for PLDP was approved in 2003 and is currently being implemented, and an \nensuing project is in the pipeline for 2005 or 2006.  The TA is closely linked to the PPTA and the \nensuing Project. It will field-test participatory and community mobilization approaches, strengthen \ntechnical support to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) based on positive outcomes and \nexperience of the FLSP. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  The goal is to enhance the livelihood and income of poor farming families through improved \nagriculture service delivery, particularly to increase livestock productivity. The immediate objective \nis to strengthen the capacity of field officers to work with poor farmers in adapting and adopting  \ntechnical and management options for improving smallholder livestock systems. It is expected that \nGovernment field officers will be able to better respond to the variations between and within \nvillages  based  on  gender,  linguistic,  cultural,  geographical,  and  livelihood  differences.    It  is ", "    3 \nanticipated that farmers will have an improved understanding of the choices available to increase \nlivestock productivity.   \n \n10.  Thus, the main expected outputs of the TA are (i) the upgraded capacity of MAF at the \nnational, provincial, and district levels through further field application of participatory methods \nintroduced by other projects; in the process, the number of field staff with experience working with \ndisadvantaged groups\u2014women and ethnic minorities\u2014 will increase; (ii) expanded and improved  \nFLSP approach to reach and involve poor farmers, particularly women and ethnic minorities to \naddress  livestock-raising  issues;  and  (iii)  improved  understanding  of  traditional  practices  in \nlivestock raising, which may be used in extending promising technology and management options \nto other areas. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  To achieve the objectives and outputs, the TA will support the following activities: (i) build \nthe capacity for participatory methods to encourage adaptation and adoption of technical and \nmanagement options for improving livestock productivity; (ii) strengthen the national and provincial \ntechnical support skills in the livestock sector; (iii) develop a systematic approach to reach and \ninvolve farmers including women and ethnic minorities; and (iv) document the experience and \nlessons learned, for incorporation in the ensuing PLDP.  The TA is linked to the PPTA, and will \nform a critical foundation for PPTA implementation. To ensure linkage between the TA and the \nPPTA, the field staff to be trained by the TA will need to actively participate in the PPTA as key \nimplementation agents by providing agriculture service in the field, training other field staff, and \nsharing experience they gained from the TA.   \n \n12.  The TA activities will be undertaken in three provinces: Luang Prabang, Xiengkhuang, and \nanother to be introduced later. In the first two, the TA activities will expand the FLSP experience to \nother districts. The criteria for selecting TA districts will be the same as for the PPTA, and will \ninclude (i) poor districts identified by NGPES, (ii) implementation capacity of districts, (iii) absence \nof similar livestock development investment, (iv) priority area of the government rural development \nstrategy, and (v) market access. The third province will be named once the project area for the \nPLDP is identified.  The third province will be selected among the PLDP target provinces according \nto the following criteria:  (i) commitment of the province to participate in the future Project and to \ndesignate two districts as pilot districts for building the capacity of district officers and provincial \nlivestock  officers;  (ii)  readiness  of  the  province  to  be  involved  in  the  TA  activities,  including \nassigning  at  least  four  full-time  district  officers  from  each  selected  district,  and  at  least  one \nprovincial full-time livestock officer; (iii) proximity to Luang Prabang and Xiengkhuang to permit \ncross-provincial visits to learn from district officers involved in the FLSP; and (iv) limited number of \nsimilar livestock development projects in the province.  Districts will be selected using the same \ncriteria applied in Luang Prabang and Xiengkhuang.   \n \n13.  Under the component on building capacity in participatory methods, at least 24 district \nofficers from the three provinces will be trained. A key criterion for their selection is that they will \nparticipate in the PPTA and the PLDP.  Preference will be given to women district officers and \nofficers with cultural and language skills to work with some ethnic groups in the district.  The TA will \nstart working with a limited number of district officers from each province, before scaling it up.  A \nconceptual  framework  for  demand-driven  and  participatory  agriculture  service  delivery  will  be \ncomplemented with on-the-job training, where selected district officers will be partnered with district \nofficers in Luang Prabang and Xiengkhuang who were trained by the FLSP, and are effectively \ndelivering demand-driven agriculture service. As a team, the district officers will initially work in two \nvillages before expanding to other villages. The new district staff will be mentored through regular ", "4 \nvisits and group meetings. Every 3 months, all district officers will meet to share their experiences \nand discuss solutions to technology development issues encountered in working in the villages. \n \n14.  To promote demand-driven agriculture service in new districts, the FLSP district officer \nteamed with officers from the new districts will help mobilize and engage villagers in analyzing \nlivestock issues and determining solutions to them. The process will involve building partnerships \nwith key community members or informants who may pass on information and assist other farmers \nin addressing livestock issues. These community members and informants will include women, \nwho are the main caretakers of small livestock such as pigs and chicken.   \n \n15.  To strengthen provincial technical support for the livestock sector, at least one full-time \nprovincial livestock officer from each province; at least two full-time national technical officers from \nLivestock Research Center, NAFRI; and an additional full-time officer from National Agriculture and \nForestry Extension Service (NAFES) or NAFRI will be identified for training. Selection criteria \ninclude (i) a mandate to provide technical support to addressing livestock health and disease \nissues, and (ii) planned involvement in the ensuing PLDP. With the implementation of activities \nunder the Livestock Project of the European Union (EU) and the Animal Health Project of ACIAR, \ntheir technical knowledge in livestock disease diagnoses, treatment, and health management will \nbe strengthened. They will also join district officers during participatory identification and analysis \nof problems related to livestock husbandry, to familiarize them with farm-level realities and ensure \nlinkage between technical support and farm-level needs. \n \n16.  A  critical  component  of  the  TA  is  to  document  the  experience,  lessons  learned,  and \nsuccesses for incorporation in the future Project.  Accordingly, field officers will record existing \npractices in livestock husbandry, labor inputs, division of labor between men and women, livestock \nmortality rate, livestock health issues, any livestock raising practice specific to the ethnic minority \ngroup; and identify priority issues in livestock husbandry. Every 3 months, they will also prepare \nsummaries of their experience, progress, and challenges faced in working with farmers to address \nlivestock issues; and reflections on how to involve women and ethnic minorities.  The summaries, \nwhich will systematically record changes in livestock management practices, livestock mortality and \nhealth, and livelihood impact from livestock, will be shared with other participating district officers. \nDistrict officers will document existing and indigenous livestock practices and beliefs that constrain \nadaptation and adoption of new technology and management options, and identify, together with \nprovincial and national technical officers, those that support livestock productivity.  The summaries \nwill be compiled into training materials for use in the PLDP. \n \n17.  The main risk is that the Government will not remain committed to upgrading agriculture \nservice delivery, particularly for livestock. There is also a risk that inappropriate Government staff \nare selected at national, provincial, and district levels to participate in the TA. To ensure that \ncommitted and interested field and technical staff are involved, a set of criteria for participation in \nTA activities will be developed during implementation. It should be recognized that the number of \nwomen and ethnic minorities among field and technical officers at the provincial and district levels \nis fairly limited. Thus, it is necessary to work with the Government to make sure that the TA \ninvolves as many field and technical officers who are women or from ethnic minority groups, or who \nmay effectively work with women farmers and with different ethnic groups.  Given the natural \nturnover of staff, it is possible that not all the national, provincial, and district officers trained under \nthe TA will be available to implement the PLDP. The Government has the responsibility of ensuring \nthat staff trained through the TA will be involved in the PLDP.  Finally, given the number of \nlivestock development investments including that of EU and International Fund for Agricultural \nDevelopment (IFAD), district selection needs coordination to minimize overlap of activities. \n ", "    5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $650,000 equivalent, comprising of $333,000 in \nforeign exchange and $317,000 equivalent in local currency.  The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund and will provide $550,000 equivalent including \n$333,000 in foreign exchange and $217,000 equivalent in local currency costs.  The Government \nof the Lao PDR will finance the balance of about $100,000 equivalent in local currency.  The \ndetailed cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 2.    \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  NAFRI will be the Executing Agency, and will arrange for necessary office space and \nsupport.  A qualified and full-time project coordinator will be designated to manage, supervise, and \nmonitor TA activities.  Since the TA is linked to the PPTA, the TA project coordinator will closely \ncoordinate with the PPTA project director. To ensure coordination with the PPTA, the PPTA project \nsteering committee headed by the MAF vice-minister will also oversee TA implementation. The \ncommittee will (i) provide overall guidance, (ii) coordinate within the Government, (iii) coordinate \nwith the PPTA, (iv) resolve any implementation issues that may arise, and (v) review the progress \nof the TA activities. A full-time provincial livestock officer from each province and four full-time staff \nfrom each district will be appointed to participate in the TA activities.  The staff should be the same \nones appointed for the PPTA.   \n \n20.  ADB will directly select CIAT to support TA implementation. CIAT whose regional office is \nbased in Vientiane, is the most qualified and competent agency to provide the required services.  It \nhas the experience, capacity, and commitment to the livestock sector in the Lao PDR, having \npioneered the application of the participatory approach in disseminating livestock management \nknowledge and technologies, and training Government staff through the FLSP. CIAT also has an \nongoing relationship with the Department of Livestock and Fisheries, NAFRI, and NAFES.  The TA \nbuilds on the experience of the FLSP supported by CIAT, and will require district officers of the \nFLSP to act as mentors to other national, provincial, and district officers of the TA. Thus, CIAT's \nresearch and extension work in the Lao PDR, its extensive knowledge and experience, its training \nmaterials,  and  its  approach  to  mentoring  and  training  Government  staff  are  critical  to  TA \nimplementation. CIAT has demonstrated its capacity to deliver quality outputs for several ADB-\nsupported TAs.   \n \n21.  The TA will be implemented in 28 months from September 2004 to December 2006.  It will \nrequire 11 person-months of international consultants in the field of participatory extension, forage \nmanagement, and animal health management. CIAT will recruit them in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants.  The consultant will work with the Government in training \nnew national, provincial, and district officers by linking them with CIAT's ongoing FLSP, and in \nensuring linkage with the PPTA activities.  CIAT will submit a simplified technical proposal to \nrecommend  a  work  program,  approach,  and  methodology,  and  personnel  schedule  for  TA \nimplementation. The outline of the terms of reference is in Appendix 3. All equipment will be \nprocured in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $550,000 to the Government of \nthe Lao People's Democratic Republic to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction \nCooperation Fund for Capacity Building for Smallholder Livestock Systems, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board.
