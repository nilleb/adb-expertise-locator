The \ncountry  strategy  of  Pakistan  emphasizes  targeting  the  poor  for  social  services.  The  Local \nGovernment Ordinance (2001) of Pakistan has assigned the bulk of social services delivery to \nlocal governments at district, subdistricts, and union levels. However, weak service delivery \nmechanisms  at  the  local  level  remain  one  of  the  key  obstacles  in  addressing  poverty  in \nPakistan. Emerging evidence shows that technical training of local service delivery agents is \nnecessary, but not sufficient for improving the quality, efficiency, and affordability of social \nservices. To be effective, joint planning, implementation, and monitoring of service delivery \namong the poor and marginalized citizens, locally elected representatives, and local service \ndelivery agents are crucial. This technical assistance (TA) will build on evidence and develop a \nmechanism to  mobilize those key grassroots stakeholders to participate in pro-poor social \nservice delivery under the Sindh Devolved Social Services Program (SDSSP).1  \n \n2.  A concept paper was prepared to develop a model for targeting the poor, vulnerable, \nand  marginalized  groups  for  access  to  grassroots  social  services  under  SDSSP.  The  TA \nconcept was endorsed for funding by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund at its Fourth \nStrategy Meeting in January 2004.2 To further discuss the scope of this TA, a Fact-Finding \nMission was undertaken in July 2004. To formulate appropriate activities and implementation \narrangements for the TA, the Mission held detailed discussions with the Economic Affairs \nDivision of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, concerned provincial government departments, \nlocally elected representatives, civil society, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and people \nfrom  various segments of local communities including women, the poor, and marginalized \ngroups.  \n \n                                                        II.   ISSUES \n3.  In Sindh, poverty increased from 27% in 1999 to 37% in 2001. Two thirds of the poor live \nin rural areas. Sindh faces a range of development issues including lack of basic services, a \nhigh incidence of health problems, low literacy rates, high population growth, weak rule of law, \nlack of access to justice, inaccessibility of capital, increased unemployment, and weak service \ndelivery.  Social sector indicators are very poor. Half of the children below 5 years of age are \nmalnourished, and 11% of them die before the age of 5. Of the survivors, half do not attend \nschool. Gross enrollment rates stand at 38% for girls and 61% for boys. The total fertility rate is \n5 children per woman. Only 22% of the rural population have access to water supply schemes \nand rural sanitation coverage is only 9%. Of the 1,399 water and sanitation schemes in the \nprovince, 353 are nonfunctional. The total number of health facilities is 1,358 of which 650 are \nnon-functional.3  The literacy rate for rural Sindh is 27% and school enrollment is 59%. These \npoor social indicators are linked to complex political and social structures, gender discrimination, \npoverty, weak governance, and lack of mechanisms for targeting the poor.  \n \n4.  The rural society of Sindh is heterogeneous and polarized in terms of ethnicity, tribes, \nand caste, and these factors, together with gender, affect differently the level of poverty and \nvulnerability of men and women. In rural Sindh, social relationships are based on caste, tribe, \nand language and are further complicated by the skewed land tenure pattern. Landownership, \nrelationships among tribes and castes, and gender determine much of the political and social \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003.

Social groups in the rural \nareas include landowners, sharecroppers (composed of both Muslim and Hindu scheduled \ncastes), small and middle farmers, wage laborers, fisherfolk, artisans, and service households. \nAmong these groups, sharecroppers, wage laborers, artisans, and fisherfolk are considered \npoor, vulnerable, and marginalized. Often development assistance does not reach these groups \nbecause of the lack of specific targeting mechanisms and inadequate strategies for mobilizing \nthem. During the past decade, the Sindh government implemented a Social Action Program \n(SAP) to improve the delivery of social sector services. The experience of the SAP indicates the \nimportance of broadening the social platform for the participation of stakeholders in designing \nand implementing development activities at the local level. Particularly important is having a \nspecific social mobilization strategy for the poor, involvement of the beneficiaries, capacity \nbuilding for the stakeholders, and good governance at the local level.    \n \n5.  In  recent  years,  multilateral  agencies  have  undertaken  several  initiatives  to  address \nmacro governance issues including administrative and system reforms in Pakistan. The World \nBank has been supporting the provincial effort to improve financing and administration and \npursue  civil  service  reforms.  ADB\u2019s  Devolution  Support  Program  (DSP)  supports  macro \ngovernance, gender, and financial management reforms. The Sindh Poverty Reduction Strategy \nPaper (PRSP) emphasizes a three-pronged poverty reduction strategy, which includes the \nequitable delivery of social services to the poor. In the social sector, the PRSP aims to improve \nperformance through better governance, stronger partnership with civil society, and needs-\nbased  allocation  of  resources.  The  Sindh  Local  Government  Ordinance  emphasizes \nstrengthening the role of the community to Increase accountability and transparency.  \n \n6.  In  Sindh,  government  ministries,  funding  agencies,  and NGOs  combined  have  been \ninvolved  in  programs  to  build  the  capacity  of  locally  elected  representatives.  In  general, \nhowever, the activities have not been focused on developing a systematic approach to building \nan institutional interface among the three key stakeholder groups for planning pro-poor services. \nThese  essential  stakeholders  are  local-level  social  service  agencies;  locally  elected \nrepresentatives; and the poor, vulnerable, and marginalized groups. The experience of ADB\u2019s \nTA on gender and governance issues in local government in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan4 \nsuggests that grassroots forums and focused training to build the capacity of local stakeholders \nsuch as female and male locally elected representatives, officials from the sectoral agencies, \npoor and marginalized groups, civil society groups, and NGOs are critical in planning for the \neffective delivery of services, and addressing poverty at the local level. The findings of that TA \nshow that improving the capacity of the locally elected representatives, and creating local-level \nforums have facilitated a transparent process for implementing development programs and \nbetter targeting the poor at the local level. \n \n7.  The following issues were identified by the TA Fact-Finding Mission: (i) services are \nmore accessible to the higher- and middle-income groups than to the lower-income groups and \nthe poor; (ii) poor and marginalized groups lack access to basic social services due partly to the \nlack of facilities and partly to the unfavorable attitude of the service providers toward those \ngroups; (iii) inadequate capacity of many officials of the service delivery agencies at the local \nlevel hinders the effective targeting and delivery of resources; (iv) lack of clarity about the roles \nand responsibilities of locally elected representatives impedes their effective functioning; (v) \nineffective planning, implementing, and monitoring of social services at the grassroots level \nindicate that local resources are often not well-utilized; (vi) lack of community involvement in \nand ownership of planning for services has resulted in poor outcomes of various development \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2001.

", "  3\nand poverty schemes; (vii) local communities including the poor and marginalized groups lack \ninformation about development plans, schemes, budget allocations, and availability of social \nservices; and (viii) lack of grassroots-level forums for the poor to voice their needs and to secure \nservices for themselves impedes effective poverty reduction. \n \n8.  The TA loan for governance capacity building which is attached to the SDSSP includes \ncapacity building for community-based organizations (CBOs), school management committees \n(SMCs), and village development associations (VDAs). However, in the CBOs, SMCs, and \nVDAs in rural Sindh there is little participation and representation of the poor or marginal \ngroups. The SDSSP does not address specific social mobilization, capacity-building activities, \nand targeting mechanisms specifically for the poor and marginalized groups.  The model for pro-\npoor  service  delivery,  to  be  developed  by  this  TA,  will  help  subsequent  activities  to  be \nundertaken in the remaining 14 districts of Sindh under the TA loan for governance capacity \nbuilding, attached to the SDSSP. It is assumed that the cost of replicating the model can be \nfinanced by this TA loan attached to the SDSSP. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.   Purpose and Output \n \n9.    The TA will develop a transparent grassroots-level decision-making model for pro-poor \nsocial service delivery under the SDSSP. The model will build on an institutionalized interface \namong elected people\u2019s representatives, officials from the social service agencies, poor people, \nand marginalized groups. The outputs will be increased access to social services by the poor \nand marginalized groups; and a better understanding by social service providers and locally \nelected representatives of their own roles and responsibilities in planning and delivering of pro-\npoor services. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.    Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.   The TA will consist of the following activities: (i) social mobilization of community-based \ngroups of the poor and marginalized groups; (ii) training programs to build the capacity of men \nand  women  locally  elected  representatives  and  the  local  social  service  agencies;  (iii) \nestablishment of local-level social development forums to promote the institutional interface \namong social service agencies, locally elected representatives, poor and marginalized groups, \nNGOs,  and  civil  society  groups;  (iv)  promotion  of  grassroots-level  monitoring  of  pro-poor \nservices; (v) creation of provincial-level workshops to share experiences and lessons learned \nfrom the two pilot districts (Khairpur and Tharparkar) and to develop strategies to be applied on \na  larger  scale  in  the  SDSSP;  and  (vi)  appointment  of  a  project  steering  committee  for \nmonitoring, disseminating and scaling up the TA activities through the SDSSP. \n \n11.  The TA will strengthen the institutional capacity of community-based groups of the poor, \nvulnerable, and marginalized people at the grassroots level for systematic representation in \nCBOs/VDAs.  At  least  50%  of  the  groups  will  consist  of  females.  Social  mobilization  and \ninstitutional  capacity  building  for  community-based  groups  of  the  poor  will  increase  their \nknowledge about existing poverty programs and social service schemes such as those for \neducation, health, water, and sanitation, and will increase their ability to negotiate services for \nthemselves. Access of the poor to information about various social services at the community \nlevel will increase the demand for pro-poor social services and increase the accountability of \nlocal administrative bodies and social service agencies.  \n                                                                                                    ", "4  \n \n12.  The  focused  capacity-building  training  of  locally  elected  representatives  and  social \nservice providers will enhance their awareness and skills and thus facilitate pro-poor planning, \nimplementation, and monitoring of social services at the grassroots level. Capacity building \ntraining  will  focus  on  the  following:  (i)  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  respective \nstakeholders  and  their  institutions;  (ii)  dissemination  of  information  about  local-level  social \nsector programs and their implementation modalities; (iii) understanding the social exclusion of \nthe  poor,  vulnerable,  and  marginalized  groups;  (iv)  learning  about  planning  and  targeting \nmechanisms for better services for the poor; (v) gender sensitization for gender-based planning \nand resource allocation; and (vi) grassroots-level participatory monitoring of social services. \nTraining community-based groups of poor men and women will include awareness raising, \nleadership building, local resource mobilization, planning and negotiating skills, and so on.  \n \n13.  Social development forums will be developed at three local government levels: union \ncouncil, subdistrict, and district. Each social development forum will include representatives of \nthe  various  stakeholders  such  as  male  and  female  locally  elected  representatives,  local \ngovernment officials, officials from social service agencies, community-based groups of the poor \nand  marginalized,  NGOs,  civil  society  groups,  citizen\u2019s  resource  centers,  and  the \nInsaf/Musalihat (justice and reconciliation) committees. The union council forum will provide the \nprimary interface among the poor people, elected representatives of the local bodies, and \ngovernment  agencies  implementing  social  sector  programs  at  the  community  level.  The \ninterface created among various stakeholders in this forum will encourage transparent and \nparticipatory monitoring processes for social service delivery at the grassroots level. Monitoring \nindicators will be developed and used by local people to track the effects of pro-poor social \nservices. Forums at the subdistricts and districts will generally be responsible for addressing the \nneeds  and  issues  identified  at  the  union  council  and  for  supervising  and  monitoring  the \nimplementation of social sector programs for the poor.   \n \n14.  The TA will be implemented on a pilot basis in Khairpur and Tharparkar districts. The \ndistricts were selected through discussions with the concerned government agencies and the \ndistrict government. Selection criteria included concentration of poor and marginalized groups, \ntopography, and leadership capacity of the district government. The pilot union councils in each \ndistrict will be identified in collaboration with the district government. Baseline surveys will be \nconducted in the pilot union councils to determine the availability of existing social services to \nthe poor, vulnerable, and marginalized groups. The survey data will be compared with results \nfrom pilot union councils and non-pilot union councils at the end of the TA.   \n        \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $625,000 equivalent comprising $71,000 in \nforeign exchange and $554,000 equivalent in local currency.  ADB will finance the entire foreign \nexchange cost of $71,000 and $429,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be \nfinanced by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund on a grant basis. The fund will be used for \nfinancing international and domestic consultants, NGO contracts including preparing training \nmaterials, delivering the training, and implementing field activities. The government of Sindh will \nprovide $125,000 equivalent primarily through in-kind contributions to cover accommodation, \nvenue  for  training,  workshop,  transport,  counterpart  staff  support,  and  monitoring  the  field \nactivities.  The TA will be administered by ADB. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan  \nare in Appendix 2. \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The Executing Agency of the TA will be the Finance Department (FD) of the government \nof Sindh. The FD will have an advisory and supervisory role.  It will monitor activities through the \nProject Support Unit (PSU) and Local Support Unit (LSU) of the SDSSP. The project steering \ncommittee (PSC) will be established in FD with the secretary of finance as chairperson. The \nmembers of the committee will include the chief economist for planning and development; \nSecretaries (or their representatives not below Special Secretary or Additional Secretary) of the \ndepartments of local government, education, health and women development; project directors \nof the SDSSP and DSP; district nazims and district coordination officers (DCOs) of the TA \nproject districts; and selected representatives from the union council social development forum \nand TA project NGOs. The project director of the SDSSP will facilitate secretarial work of the \nPSC. \n  \n17.  The  TA  activities  will  be  implemented  by  national  NGOs,  recruited  according  to \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. The NGOs will be eligible for selection based on their previous \nexperience  in  implementing  poverty  reduction  and  service  delivery  projects,  in  developing \ntraining  modules  and  conducting  participatory  training  for  grassroots-level  stakeholders,  in \ntraining local government representatives, and in facilitating social mobilization activities for the \npoor and marginalized groups. Experience in implementing ADB projects will be an advantage. \nThe TA will require 7 person-months of consulting services: 4 domestic and 3 international. The \nconsultants will be recruited individually in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. The terms of reference of the consultants and participating NGOs are in Appendix \n3.   \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 2 years and is expected to start in January 2005 and \nbe completed in December 2007. The first month will be used to select the NGOs. The next 2 \nmonths will focus on reconnaissance visits to the field to select the union councils and identify \ncommunity-based groups of the poor, vulnerable, and marginalized. Also to be completed in this \nperiod are an assessment of the training needs of various stakeholders and development of \ntraining  modules.  Capacity-building  training  for  stakeholders,  the  initial  formation  of  social \ndevelopment forums, and various social mobilization activities will start from month 4. The \ntraining of the elected representatives and the local-level service providers will be completed by \nthe end of the month 8. Activities of the social development forums and social mobilization will \ncontinue throughout the project period. Participating NGOs will submit an inception report within \nthe first 2 months of implementation. A provincial workshop will be held after the first 12 months, \nand another at the end of the TA.  The international consultant will prepare the final report \ndetailing  the  results  of  the  TA  and  will  submit  to  ADB  1  month  before  the  end  of  the \nimplementation period.   \n \nIV.
