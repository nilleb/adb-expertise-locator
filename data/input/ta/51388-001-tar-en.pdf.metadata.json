INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will appraise and define the key \nparameters to successfully establish cross-boundary regional integrated waste management \nsystems in the greater Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei (BTH) region.1 \n \n2.  The TA is included in the country operations business plan for the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC), 2018\u20132020.2 The TA is fully aligned with the country partnership strategy for the \nPRC, 2016\u20132020, which prioritizes managing climate change and the environment to support the \ngovernment\u2019s priorities in realizing an \"ecological civilization\".3 The TA will also support the \nstrategic priorities of the Strategy 2030 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to mitigate climate \nchange and promote environmental sustainability.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The greater BTH region contributes to almost one third of the PRC\u2019s gross domestic \nproduct, making it one of the most important and dynamic regions in the country. The PRC has \ndesignated the BTH region a priority area because it is essential for increasing intraregional \ncooperation, leveraging productivity, improving resource use efficiency, integrating infrastructure, \nand controlling air pollution. ADB started the BTH initiative in 2015 to support this Government \npriority. ADB\u2019s lending support during 2015\u20132020 in the BTH region revolves around three key \npillars (i) policy and regulatory framework in the region; (ii) tailored financing approaches; and    \n(iii) promote use of high technology in key sectors. ADB\u2019s support complements the government \nand other development partners\u2019 actions.5 ADB lending support each year is mutually reinforcing \nand backed up by analytical, policy advisory and capacity development non-lending work, many \nof which are already in progress.6 Most of this support has addressed measures to improve air \nquality through transport and energy initiatives. There remains a need to also address municipal \nsolid waste management as it contributes to air and water pollution in the region, and investment \nand economic inefficiencies. \n \n4.  Although other areas in the PRC (such as the Pearl and Yangtze river deltas) have \nwitnessed some cross-boundary co-development, establishing and operating regional waste \nmanagement systems in large urban agglomerations is challenging. Administrative and legal \n                                                \n1  The greater BTH region comprises Beijing and Tianjin municipalities; the provinces of Hebei, Henan, Liaoning    \nShandong, and Shanxi; as well as the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. \n2  ADB. 2018.

The TA first \nappeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 6 August 2018. \n3  An \"ecological civilization\" refers to achieving harmony between growth, people, and nature. It includes activities to \nmitigate ecological damage, relieve pressures on natural resources, and improve the balance between the \nenvironment and the economy. ADB. 2016.

Manila. \n \n ", "2 \nobstacles make it difficult to empower a cross-border authority to assume more responsibility for \nregional waste management. Municipalities and counties do not share facilities because of a lack \nof  high-level  coordination,  impeding  the  establishment  of  regionally  integrated  waste \nmanagement systems. The BTH region needs support to establish mechanisms to coordinate \nand solve municipal solid waste (MSW) issues. Upgrading existing MSW systems and adapting \nthese to newly shaped cross-border catchment areas, particularly in the corridor along the edges \nof the BTH region, requires coherent cross-border planning that has yet to be established. \nAlthough PRC Thirteenth Five-Year Plan and associated policies highlight the need for improved \ncross-border urban management and regional MSW management, PRC law does not provide \nmechanisms to establish cross-border institutions.7 Therefore, alternative approaches will need \nto be considered to introduce a regionally integrated MSW management in the BTH region. \n \n5.  Rapid urbanization in the PRC is changing population and income dynamics and resulting \nin  new  consumption  and  waste-generation  patterns.  The  increasing  volume  and  changing \ncomposition of waste is challenging existing waste management infrastructure. These challenges \nwill deepen as more urban agglomerations in the PRC increase in size. Furthermore, it is \nbecoming increasingly difficult to site new facilities in heavily populated Beijing and Tianjin \nbecause  of  land  scarcity  and  a  lack  of  public  understanding  on  waste  disposal  practices. \nProcedures to enable the public to proactively participate in MSW planning to overcome the \"not \nin my backyard\" problem have yet to be applied. Diversion of waste from landfills is being applied \ninconsistently, and alternative technologies are not being used consistently across the BTH region. \nCurrent disposal practices favor landfilling or incineration; special treatment of organic waste has \nonly recently been introduced.  \n \n6.  The  PRC\u2019s  Thirteenth  Five-Year  Plan  calls  for  formalizing  and  extending  recycling. \nDespite this, the region continues to rely mainly on the informal sector to recycle and carry out \nsource-separation of recyclables. Similarly, PRC and BTH waste authorities have not analyzed \nexisting MSW infrastructure for major upgrades or practice improvements, despite available \nsolutions.8  For example, combining waste-to-energy plants with local district heating systems \nwould reduce the overall environmental footprint of waste management systems and increase \nresource efficiencies. However, the BTH region has had little success scaling up and integrating \nwaste management infrastructure at the regional level to leverage economies of scale, optimize \ntransport routes, or improve equipment technology. Consequently, MSW facilities across the BTH \nregion are lacking in terms of size, location, and technology. For example, Hebei Province has a \nrelatively fragmented ad hoc disposal and treatment regime, with almost every county managing \nits own separate waste management facilities. By contrast, Beijing and Tianjin have developed \nlarger, more efficient disposal sites and treatment plants, yet they are already at capacity with \nconsequent environmental integrity and financial management concerns. No waste management \nagency in BTH has had any success formalizing the small ad hoc regional cooperation solutions, \nlet alone solving the broader concerns facing the larger waste management operations. \n \n7.  The  PRC\u2019s  waste-related  regulations  are  comprehensive  and  based  on  robust \nenvironmental laws. Regulations cover (i) environmental protection, (ii) prevention and control of \nenvironmental pollution from solid waste, (iii) promotion of cleaner production, and (iv) promotion \n                                                \n7  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, State Council. 2016.

However, enforcement of these regulations and monitoring of compliance \nmeasures are mostly left to local governments. BTH waste management agencies must bridge \nthese regulatory weaknesses and adapt themselves and their regulations to be able to respond \nto future national and regional policy and planning requirements.9 \n \n8.  Regional MSW management solutions are not well understood at the local authority level. \nRapid urbanization and changing population and income dynamics lead to varied consumption \nand waste generation patterns. Waste management infrastructure in the BTH region must account \nfor these crucial changes. Knowledge of international and regional best practices is weak across \nalmost all BTH administrative levels, to such a degree, alternatives are not well understood or \ndiscussed. Regional public MSW campaigns (e.g., to promote waste reduction, recycling, or \nsource segregation) to reduce the amount of waste disposed at regional facilities are generally \ninconsistent and are only sustained beyond a few years. Ultimately, they have limited to no effect \non waste generation rates. County and city capacity to initiate, monitor, and control regional waste \nmanagement  systems  is  limited.  The  Ministry  of  Housing  and  Urban\u2013Rural  Development \n(MOHURD) is responsible for overseeing MSW management in the PRC and is working to \ndevelop a strategy to improve coordination across the BTH region. \n \n9.  The financial benefits of a regionally integrated MSW management model for the BTH \nregion are difficult to determine. This presents an obstacle to mobilizing resources efficiently. At \nthe county and district levels, fees paid by waste generators are insufficient to cover system costs. \nA lack of meaningful data makes it difficult to gauge the financial requirements of counties and \ndistricts and to reliably calculate the benefits of economies of scale. Alternative financial models \nsuch as polluter-pays and extended producer responsibility, which eventually could reduce the \nneed for financial subsidies from local government administrations, are not well recognized in the \nPRC.10 Similarly, BTH waste management agencies\u2019 understanding of policies and public\u2013private \npartnership approaches to regionally integrate MSW systems need to be improved. Large scale \nregional MSW facilities operate more efficiently despite higher transportation costs, yet their \nviability for a public\u2013private partnership investor primarily depends on the revenue generated from \ngate fees and sales of any recovered products. These products include (i) electricity (from     \nwaste-to-energy  plants)  with  feed-in  tariffs  that  are  nationally  regulated,  and (ii)  recovered \nrecyclables that are subject to a highly fluctuating local and international commodities market. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: (i) management of climate change in BTH \nregion  improved;  and  (ii)  the  government\u2019s  priorities  in  realizing  an  ecological  civilization \nsupported (footnote 3). The TA will have the following outcome: regional MSW management \nmodel for the BTH region established.11 \n \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2018.

Two BTH municipalities and one BTH province will endorse regional integration of MSW \nmanagement as proposed under the TA. Following this endorsement, the BTH governments will \nestablish a mechanism to promote the regional MSW integration approach across the region. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n12.  The project will have two outputs.  \n \n13.  Output 1: Integrated regional municipal solid waste management model for the \nBeijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei region developed. Based on the lessons from the integrative nature of \nthe air quality work and lessening negative impact in the environment  undertaken in the current \nADB BTH initiatives, the team will (i) identify scope of needed integration and develop an \nintegrated regional MSW management model for the BTH region that will lead to coherent \nplanning and coordination to overcome administrative barriers and improve resource allocation \nefficiency; (ii) define the institutional setup for cross-border MSW management and suggest ways \nto improve regulations relating to environment and financial sustainability; and (iii) explore and \nrecommend cost recovery mechanisms, including structured cross-border fund transfers and   \neco-compensation models. \n \n14.  The TA team will evaluate current and projected data on waste composition and quantity \nand will undertake a census and review of existing MSW treatment facilities across the BTH region. \nThis will provide a baseline for defining an integrated waste treatment scheme that provides \noptions for optimizing both technology and regional distribution. Upon due consultation with the \nstakeholders and in line with national policies, the TA team will make recommendations to \nimprove  the  efficiency  of  collection,  transport,  and  disposal  operations  in  at  least  four \nappropriately sized catchment areas.  \n \n15.  Output 2: Regional municipal solid waste management understanding and capacity \nin the Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei region enhanced. To improve MSW management understanding \nand capacity across the BTH region, the TA team will (i) provide four thematic discussion \nworkshops related to  output  1,  with  a focus  on  approaches for  integrating  regional  waste \nmanagement systems; (ii) deliver at least one TA project results dissemination workshop in \nanother urban agglomeration in the PRC; and (iii) conduct an international study tour to expose \nparticipants  to  international  best  practices  in  regional  MSW  management  and  \neco-compensation.12 An article detailing the TA project and its results will be published by the TA \nteam on http://development.asia. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $450,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 2. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of office \nspace,  office  supplies,  secretarial  assistance,  domestic  transportation,  and  other                          \nin-kind contributions.  \n \nD.
