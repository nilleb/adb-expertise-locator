An initial environmental examination was completed.  \nAssessment   \nProject Description  The  Project  will  improve  dryland  farming  in  Gansu,  Henan,  and \nShandong provinces, and is located in the transition zone from the \nnortheastern to the central western plains along the middle reaches of \nthe  Yellow  River.  The  Project  will  benefit  about  600,000  farm \nhouseholds  and  improve  the  production  capacity  of  about  120,000 \nhectares (ha) in 27 counties, cities, and districts. The Project will adopt \na  farm-to-market,  value-chain  approach  that  creates  value  for  poor \nfarmers, local agroenterprises, and consumers. It will introduce high-\nvalue horticulture crops and improved crop and livestock management, \nfarm  technologies,  and  cultivation  practices.  Organic  fertilizers  and \nagrochemicals will be more effectively used and the quality of farm \nproduce improved through support services provided by participating \nprivate agroenterprises. These include soil-testing facilities, agricultural \nextension and technology transfer centers, organic fertilizer facilities, \nmachinery  service  centers,  seed  production  centers,  agricultural \nproduce  information  centers,  product-testing  centers,  and  expanded \nhorticulture markets. \n \nThe  Project  will  develop  about  29  partnerships  between  private \nagroenterprises and farmers using contract farming arrangements to \nstrengthen  farm  productivity,  and  food  production  and  processing \ncapacity  to  take  advantage  of  growing  domestic  and  international \nmarkets. Sustainable production and processing partnerships according \nto the \u201cdragon-head\u201d concept will be used to develop crops and other \noutputs  that  are  processed  and  marketed  by  the  enterprise.  The \ndragon-head agribusiness structure is a successful, vertically integrated \nenterprise model that has demonstrated the capacity to contract with a \nlarge number of farmers to improve rural incomes through value-chain \nlinkages  and  efficiencies,  access  to  higher-value  markets,  and \nemployment opportunities.  \n \nThe agroenterprises were selected using strict selection criteria and due \ndiligence assessment of financial, economic, environmental, and social \nfactors. They will be provided with long-term financing to expand their \nfood processing and marketing operations. \n \nFarmers will diversify and modify their existing traditional cultivation of \nlow-yielding and low-value food crops to higher-yielding and higher-\nvalue  crops.  Their  partnerships  with  profitable  and  expanding ", "ii \nagroenterprises  will  ensure  them  higher  prices  for  their  outputs, \npremium prices for quality, and a guaranteed price at harvest time. \nFarmers\u2019 average income will increase by an estimated 15%\u201325% as a \nresult of the Project. Technological improvements include (i) adopting \nhigh-yielding  varieties  and  improved  animal  breeds;  conservation \nagriculture  techniques  such  as  returning  crop  residues  to  the  soil, \nminimum  tillage,  and  soil  conservation  measures;  water-harvesting \ntechniques such as storage tanks, lined wells, and small check dams; \nand water-saving technologies such as drip irrigation, sprinklers, and \npipes; (ii) minimizing the use of chemical fertilizers and replacing them \nwith  organic  fertilizers,  and  minimizing  the  use  of  pesticides  and \nherbicides; (iii) reducing postharvest losses with the use of advanced \npostharvest and processing equipment; (iv) intercropping within tree \ncrops; and (v) upgrading vegetable greenhouses and vineyards.  \n \nLocal  government  support  services  will  work  with  enterprises  and \nfarmers  to  expand  environment-friendly  farming  and  processing \npractices. Local governments will provide project management that will \nsupport  improved  provincial  and  county  project  implementation, \nmonitoring, evaluation, and national project coordination. The Executing \nAgency, the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), the three provincial project \nmanagement offices (PMOs), and the county PMOs were extensively \ninvolved  in  project  preparation,  including  applying  the  criteria  for \nselecting  the  agroenterprises  and  partnerships  with  farmers.  These \ninstitutions will receive training to continue applying the criteria and \nfinancial administration, and to effectively monitor the performance of \nthe agroenterprises and local government support services, and the \ndelivery of financial and economic benefits to farmers. Training will also \nbe provided on imprest account management, project implementation, \nand project performance management. \n \nRationale  Most of the population in the project area depend on agriculture, and \nare poor and vulnerable. All of the farms are very small, averaging \nabout 0.28 ha. The average rural household income is only two thirds of \nthe national average. About 60% of household income in the project \narea is from farming, and rural unemployment and underemployment \nare significant. Farmers have limited access to markets and technology \nto  diversify  into  higher-value  crops.  Over  the  years,  poor  farming \npractices have accelerated land and water resources degradation. As a \nresult, farm productivity poses a threat to the environment including \nland and other natural resources. Sustainable farming is under threat \nwith ever-decreasing water resources. This has caused declining soil \nfertility and productivity, increasing farm input costs, and decreasing \nfarm  incomes.  The  correlation  between  land  degradation  and  the \nincidence of poverty is strong. Implementation of simple water and land \nconservation practices can improve fertility and stop land degradation. \nSustainable farming practices need to be strengthened and support \nprovided for undertaking higher value on-farm and off-farm activities, \nincreasing  agricultural  productivity  and  farm  incomes,  and  reducing \npoverty by linking farmers to local agroenterprises. \n  \nIn the project area, all of the participating enterprises have already \nestablished  effective  relationships  with  smallholder  farmers.  The ", "iii \ncontract  farming  approach  has  been  successfully  adopted  and  has \nhelped  farmers  secure  cheaper  inputs  and  produce  higher-quality \nproducts at premium prices. In this business model, an enterprise links \nwith a production base of contracted farmers (either direct or through \nagents) and farmer associations.  \n \nThe Project has strong commitment from the stakeholders to introduce \nsustainable  farming  practices  including  the  use  of  contract  farming \nthrough  local  enterprises,  to  adopt  a  farm-to-market,  value-chain \napproach; and to strengthen agriculture extension services. It also has \na  wider  demonstration  and  replication  impact  within  and  to  other \nprovinces  to  address  rural  development  issues  including  sharing \nexperiences and improving the adoption of lessons. This approach is \nfully  consistent  with  the  PRC\u2019s  11th  Five-Year  Plan  to  promote \nconservation  agriculture,  crop  diversification,  use  of  improved  crop \nvarieties,  and  soil  and  water  conservation.  Overall,  the  Project  will \npromote sustainable farming practices and technologies to address land \ndegradation and reduce poverty. \n \nImpact and  The expected impact of the Project will be reduced rural poverty in the \nOutcome  project area of Gansu, Henan, and Shandong provinces with increased \nincomes and livelihood opportunities from the sustainable use of land \nand water resources. The expected outcome is increased agricultural \nproductivity through the adoption of sustainable farming practices in the \nproject area to support higher-value, on-farm and postharvest activities. \n \nProject Investment  The  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $204.69  million \nPlan   including taxes and duties of $9.36 million. \n \nFinancing Plan  A loan of $83,000,000 from the ordinary capital resources of the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have \na 25-year term including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per annum on undisbursed funds, and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  loan  and  project \nagreements. The Spanish Cooperation Fund for Technical Assistance \nwill provide a grant of $350,000 equivalent, to be administered by ADB, \nfor strengthening the implementation capacity of implementing agencies \nand  the  project  performance  management  system  required  for \nsuccessful implementation of the Project. \n \nTotal \nSource  % \n($ million) \nAsian Development Bank Loan  83.00  40.55 \nSpanish Cooperation Fund for Technical  0.35  0.17 \nAssistance \nNational Government  0.90  0.44 \nProvincial and County Governments  9.01  4.40 \nAgroenterprises  97.83  47.80 \nFarmers  13.60  6.64 \n  Total  204.69  100.00 \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "iv \nAllocation and  The Borrower is the PRC. It will relend the proceeds of the ADB loan to \nRelending Terms  Gansu ($25 million base cost), Henan ($36 million base cost), and \nShandong  ($22  million  base  cost)  for  onlending  to  the  participating \ncounty governments on the same terms and conditions as those of the \nADB loan. The county governments will onlend the funds to private \nagroenterprises on the same conditions as those of the ADB loan, but \nwith an additional interest rate spread of up to 0.2% if applicable, to \ncover possible losses and delays in repayment for a 10- to 15-year term \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  up  to  5  years  (depending  on  the \nagroenterprise  cash  flow  and  debt  service  capacity).  The \nagroenterprises will bear all interest charges and foreign exchange risk. \n \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2014 \n \nEstimated Project  30 June 2014 \nCompletion Date \nExecuting Agency  MOA \n \nImplementation  MOA will coordinate and supervise all implementation activities through \nArrangements  the  existing  National  Project  Coordination  Committee.  MOA  has \ndesignated the Foreign Economic Cooperation Center to be the central \nPMO for the Project. Provincial and county leading groups have been \nconstituted and are functioning. The provincial governments will be the \nprovincial  executing  agencies,  and  the  county,  city,  and  district \ngovernments will be the implementing agencies for all project activities. \nMOA will be in charge of overall coordination and monitoring of the \nProject.  The  3  provincial  and  27  county  PMOs  will  supervise \nimplementation  activities.  MOA  will  provide  technical  guidance  and \nbackstopping to the PMOs. Major tasks of the provincial and county \nPMOs include (i) overseeing implementation of all components, outputs, \nand activities; (ii) drawing up annual work programs and budgets in \nconsultation with MOA; (iii) supervising compliance of procurement with \nADB  guidelines;  (iv) maintaining  consolidated  accounts  including \ndeveloping a system to track all financial transactions with enterprise \nsubborrowers;  (v) preparing  and  submitting  applications  to  ADB  for \nwithdrawing  funds  under  the  loan;  and  (vi)  monitoring  physical  and \nfinancial progress including benefit flows to intended beneficiaries, and \nsubmitting these along with monitoring reports to MOA and ADB. The \nkey role of the national and provincial governments will be to ensure (i) \nthat  participating  farmers  receive  technical  and  financial  support  in \norder  to  realize  the  intended  benefits  in  terms  of  productivity  and \nincome  increases  through  favorable  contracts  and  prices  with  the \nenterprises, and (ii) that poverty is reduced in the project area. The \nprovincial and county agencies (finance bureaus, agriculture bureaus, \nand  environmental  protection  bureaus)  will  assist  the  PMOs.  The \nagroenterprises  will  work  with  farmers  and  farmer  associations  to \ndevelop  the  production  areas  or  bases  and  upgrade  processing \nfacilities,  and  will  be  responsible  for  all  marketing  activities.  The \nimplementation capacity of the institutions and enterprises involved is \nconsidered adequate given their current staffing, incremental staffing \nplans,  previous  implementation  experience  with  externally  financed \nprojects and providing financial support to agroenterprises, previous \ntraining, and planned training under the Project. ", "v \n  The Project will be complemented by a cofinancing grant of $350,000 \nfrom the Government of Spain to finance part of the farmer support and \nlocal government monitoring activities. The grant will also strengthen \nthe capacity of the implementing agencies and the project performance \nmanagement  system  for  successful  implementation.  The  grant  will \npromote the delivery of support services to improve yields, agricultural \nproductivity,  and  environment-friendly  practices  on  an  individual \nhousehold and farmer group basis, including conservation agriculture \nand  water  harvesting,  and  collection  technologies.  Implementation \nmethods  will  draw  on  proven  participatory  and  holistic  approaches, \nincluding participatory watershed management, group-based extension \nservices  and  farmer  field  schools,  and  successful  examples  of \nagroenterprises  working  with  farmers  using  contract  farming \nrelationships.  \n \nProcurement  All procurement of goods and works will be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). Contracts for goods estimated to exceed $1 million and contracts \nfor  works  estimated  to  exceed  $10  million  will  be  procured  using \ninternational competitive bidding procedures. Contracts for goods and \nworks estimated to be less than the international competitive bidding \nvalues  but  more  than  $100,000,  will  be  procured  through  national \ncompetitive bidding procedures in accordance with the PRC Tendering \nand  Bidding  Law,  1999,  subject  to  modifications  agreed  with  ADB. \nContracts for goods and works estimated to cost $100,000 or less will \nbe procured using shopping procedures. The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) will be included in all \nprocurement documents and contracts. \n \nConsulting  The cofinancing grant from the Spanish Cooperation Fund for Technical \nServices  Assistance will cover the costs of consultants; international and national \nexperts will be recruited through a firm using the quality- and cost-\nbased selection method with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. This will \ncover  (i)  the  preparation  and  delivery  of  training  (about  50  short \ncourses) to farmers and agriculture technicians in the project area on \nparticipatory soil and water management, and sustainable agriculture \n(by  international  and  national  consultants);  (ii)  support  to  local \ninstitutions  in  Gansu,  Henan,  and  Shandong  provinces  to  facilitate \nadoption of sustainable agriculture in collaboration with training course \ndelivery;  and  (iii)  training  materials.  The  national  and  provincial \ngovernments will provide office and training facilities, domestic travel, \ncounterpart agency support service staff, and materials and equipment \nto  demonstrate  sustainable  agricultural  technology.  The  provincial \ngovernments, agroenterprises, and farmer communities will cover the \ncosts of implementing sustainable agriculture action plans produced \nfrom the training. All recruitment will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nProject Benefits  The  major  direct  benefits  of  the  Project  are  (i)  increased  crop  and \nand Beneficiaries  horticulture development for about 120,000 ha of degraded and eroded \nland or areas susceptible to erosion; (ii) increased production of wheat, \nwheat products, corn, cornstarch, cotton seed, and associated products \n(oil cake and oil), vegetables, organic vegetables, and grapes for wine \n ", "vi \nand juices; (iii) qualitative improvements for fruits, Chinese dates, sweet \npotatoes,  pepper  and  garlic,  mushrooms,  ginko,  high-value  herbs, \nconcentrated  soybean  and  peanut  products,  and  vegetable  seed; \n(iv) additional production of pork, piglets, processed beef, milk, wool, \neggs, honey, and animal feed; (v) construction of markets and storage \nfacilities for perishable and semiperishable commodities and packing \nmaterials, and production of organic fertilizers and farm machines and \ntools; and (vi) establishment of village information centers. \n \nThe major beneficiaries will be about 600,000 farm households, whose \naverage  family  income  will  be  increased  by  15%\u201325%  at  full \ndevelopment.  During  construction  and  operation  of  the  food  and \nlivestock-related processing lines, the Project will create about 34,200 \njobs including about 9,000 jobs for the poor. Families from the project \narea will be given preference, women in particular, for employment by \nthe  agroenterprises.  The  financial  internal  rates  of  return  for  the \npartnerships of agroenterprises and farmers range from 14% to 25.5%. \nThe Project\u2019s estimated economic internal rate of return is about 36%. \n \nThe major environmental benefits will be realized through improved and \nincreased agricultural productivity and farming practices that (i) improve \nsoil nutrition and quality, (ii) reduce wind and water erosion of soil, and \nreduce water runoff, (iii) increase water retention in fragile soil, and \n(iv) reduce soil salinity. \n \nRisks and  The  repayment  risk  will  be  shared  by  the  provincial  governments, \nAssumptions  participating  county  governments,  and  agroenterprises.  The  local \ngovernments have guaranteed the repayment of disbursed loan funds. \nIn  case  of  repayment  default,  the  provincial  governments  agree  to \ndeduct  amounts  due  from  the  public  budgets  of  the  county \ngovernments. The local governments have a strong incentive to partner \nwith successful private commercial agricultural companies to channel \ninputs to farmers and link farmers\u2019 outputs to the market. \n \nTo mitigate the risk of crop losses due to climate change and other \nnatural disasters, the provincial governments will design and implement \nagricultural risk mitigation schemes to provide needed compensation \nand relief to the participating farmers against crop and livestock losses \ndue to natural disasters.  \n \nThe financial risk associated with financing the participating enterprises \nhas been substantially mitigated through the stringent selection of the \nparticipating enterprises. The historic and future financial management \nassessments  and  other  due  diligence  reviews  complement  risk \nmitigation efforts. Market and demand analyses were conducted and all \nthe  agroenterprises  have  been  found  to  have  well-established \nmarkets\u2014both domestic and international. \n \nExtensive  training  and  capacity  improvement  activities  will  be  an \nintegral  part  of  project  implementation.  Measures  are  designed  to \nstrengthen financial management capacity and mitigate residual control \nrisks.  Training  courses  on  good  agriculture  practices  in  the  PRC \n(ChinaGAP), which aim to address food quality and safety issues, were ", "vii \nconducted  during  project  preparation.  All  participating  enterprises \nexpressed their interest in pursuing ChinaGAP certification, which will \neventually  match  standards  for  certified  producers  employing \nGLOBALGAP.  It  will  facilitate  raw  material  traceability  and  enhance \nquality. This will provide the necessary reassurance for importers with \nrespect to Chinese product quality. Project agencies do not influence \ntrade barriers or currency risk. However, ongoing Government dialogue \nwith the World Trade Organization and bilateral and multilateral trade \nnegotiations is addressing these risks. \n \n ", "100 o 00'E 120 o 00'E\nDRYLAND SUSTAINABLE\nAGRICULTURE PROJECT\nIN THE\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA HEILONGJIANG Tongjiang\nManzhouli Jixian\nJiamusi\nHarbin\nSuifenhe\nJILIN\nChangchun\nJilin\nINNER  MONGOLIA\nSiping\nTieling\nShenyang\n40 o 00'N\nBenxi\nLIAONING\nJinzhou Nanfen\nJining Zhangjiakou Yingkou Dandong\nShanhaiguan\nHohhot\nBEIJING\nTangshan\n40 o 00'N Yumen Shizuishan Tianjin TIANJIN Dalian\nBohai  Sea\nHEBEI\nYinchuan\nYantai\nTaiyuan\nQingtongxia Shijiazhuang\nLiulin\nShuyang Qingdao\nJinan\nSHAANXI\nQINGHAI Xining NINGXIA SHANXI SHANDONG Yellow  Sea  \nXinxiang\nLanzhou Lianyungang\nWeinan Tongguan Luoyang Zhangzhou XuzhoJuIANGSU\nGANSU Sanmenxia\nBaoji Xi'an HENAN\nHefei Nanjing Shanghai\nSHANGHAI\nMianyang ANHUI\nNanchong HUBEI Wuhan Hangzhou Ningbo\nChengdu Anqing\nJiujiang\nXIZANG SICHUAN CHONGQING E a s t    C h i n a   S e a \nZHEJIANG\nChongqing Jingdezhen\nNanchang\nHUNAN\nChangsha\nYongan N\nXiangtan\nHengyang JIANGXI Fuzhou\nGuiyang FUJIAN\nGUIZHOU Quanzhou\n0 100 200 300 400\nGuilin Xiamen\nKunming\nPingpo Qujing Liuzhou Zhangzhou Kilometers\nGUANGDONG\nRuili Chuxiong\nYUNNAN GUANGXI GuangzhouHuangpu Tanxi Shantou Project Province\nLongyang\nFoshan Shenzhen National Capital\nNanningKaipingZhuMkaaicau HOHNoGng K KOoNnGg SAR Provincial Capital 20 o 00'N\nMACAU SAR City/Town\nFangchengBeihai Zhanjiang SAR Special Administrative Region\nMain Road\nGulf  of\n20 o 00'N Tonkin Provincial Boundary\nHaikou\nInternational Boundary\nHAINAN\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\nSanya\nS o u t h    C h i n a   S e a \n100 o 00'E 120 o 00'E\n08-2396 HR", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) a proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Spanish Cooperation \nFund for Technical Assistance, both to the People's Republic of China (PRC) for the Dryland \nSustainable  Agriculture  Project  (the  Project).  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \n2.  In August 2005, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a project preparatory \ntechnical assistance (TA) to formulate the Project.1 This report is based on the findings of the \nTA,  government  feasibility  study  reports,  findings  of  ADB  missions,  and  discussions  with \nGovernment officials and stakeholders.  \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n3.  In the PRC, demand for agricultural products, especially higher-value horticulture crops \nand  livestock,  has  risen  sharply  in  recent  years  as  a  result  of  increasing  incomes  and \nurbanization. Since 2000, world commodity and agricultural prices have increased sharply due \nto (i) high rates of global growth and food demand, (ii) increased use of biofuel in developed \ncountries (e.g., corn prices in the United States have doubled in the last 2 years), (iii) increased \noil and fuel prices, and (iv) droughts and animal diseases.2 Prices of pork and other agricultural \nproduce have also sharply increased in the PRC. The share of agriculture in the gross domestic \nproduct declined from more than 25% in the 1980s to about 11% in 2006. Poverty is higher in \nrural areas, particularly in rain-fed and dryer areas. Consumers spend about 30% of their \nincomes on food. As a consequence, increasing demand and higher prices for high-quality \nproducts represent an excellent opportunity for farmers and agroenterprises to capitalize on \nmarket opportunities. The Government policy to develop the sector is emphasized in the New \nSocialist  Countryside  Policy3 and  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan  (FYP)  (2006\u20132010).  Objectives \ninclude (i) improving farm and off-farm income opportunities; (ii) increasing grain production, \nand developing agribusiness and farmer organizations; and (iii) adopting standards and capacity \nto address environmental issues.4 Growth in agroenterprises provides opportunities for people \nto leave farming for off-farm employment, and facilitates more sustainable farm structure and \npractices by reducing population pressure on the land. Higher-quality products for the market \nrequire supply-side strengthening; efficiency gains; and improved prices to farmers through \nbetter coordination with enterprises, market agents, support services, and financial resources.  \n \n4.  The PRC has some of the worst land degradation in the world, with more than 40% of its \nland area (3 million\u20134 million square kilometers) adversely affected.

To  respond  to  the  increasing  threat,  the  Government  significantly \nexpanded its programs to combat land degradation including agricultural technology transfer \n(conservation  agriculture,  improved  varieties,  and  mechanization),  reforestation,  closure  of \nforest and grazing areas, and soil and water conservation. A sector review is in Appendix 2. \n \n5.  For traditional smallholder farmers, market access has become increasingly difficult. \nMillions of very small-scale farm households are unable to compete\u2014to respond to changes in \ndomestic demand and to withstand pressure from international markets\u2014without changing their \nproduction and trading structures. Evidence from the PRC and elsewhere of socioeconomic \nbenefits provides a strong development rationale for strengthening processor\u2013farmer linkages \nthrough  contracts,  alliances,  and  other  relationships.5 Contract  farming  offers  a  means  to \nefficiently connect small-scale farmers and large-scale food processing firms. The Government \nrecognizes this and is implementing programs and incentives, such as credit support and tax \nreduction for agribusinesses involved in contract farming. Contract farming has grown rapidly \nover the past 10 years, initially in the economically advanced coastal provinces. Now, it is \nspreading rapidly into underdeveloped areas of central and western PRC. The increase in \ncontracting  between  agroenterprises  and  farmers  is  part  of  the  vertical  integration  trend \nexperienced in agribusiness worldwide as both partners seek to minimize transaction costs and \nsupply uncertainty. The agribusiness model has proven potential to improve farm incomes. A \nsurvey6 of more than 1,000 PRC farmers found that only 20% were involved in contracts, but \nthat 76% would like to be involved in contract farming if offered the opportunity.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n  1.  Project Area  \n \n6.  The project area encompasses overstressed, fragile, and degraded dryland areas along \nthe Yellow River in three provinces: Gansu in the severely eroded western loess plateau, Henan \nin the central region, and Shandong in the northeastern plains. The Project will support 27 rural \nand poor counties, cities, and districts in the three provinces. Of the total 811,000 ha of arable \nland in the three provinces, about 324,000 ha (40%) are classified as degraded. In Gansu, 60% \nof its total 281,000 ha are degraded; in Henan, 36% of 328,000 ha are degraded; and in \nShandong, about 25% of the total 201,000 ha are degraded. Rainfall in this semiarid climate is \nconcentrated between July and September, severe erosion and floods occur during the wet \nseason, and water shortages during the dry season. The fragile nature of the soil, deforestation, \novergrazing, and removal of crop residues for fuel and fodder have resulted in the project area \nhaving some of the most degraded land in the country. \n \n7.  The project area has about 2.8 million farm households. Of these, 1.3 million (48%) are \nin  Henan,  721,000  (26%)  in  Gansu,  and  719,000  (26%)  in  Shandong.  The  average  per \nhousehold farm area is about 0.28 ha, ranging from 0.39 ha in Gansu, to 0.25 ha in Henan, and \n0.28 ha in Shandong. The traditional rain-fed wheat and corn cropping system is dominant on \nflatland and terraced hillsides, augmented by fruits, vegetables, and livestock. Small farm size, \nlow and decreasing yields, limited access to technology, and a failure in the formal rural finance \nmarket  for  long-term  credit  are  key  constraints  in  the  cycle  of  rural  poverty  and  land \ndegradation. Farmers are highly vulnerable to the impact of land degradation, and natural and \n                                                 \n5  Da Silva, Carlos. 2005.

", "  3\neconomic shocks; they have little or no ability to cope with the costs and risks of changing to \nmore  sustainable  farming  practices.  Land  degradation  results  in  declining  productivity, \nincreasing farm input costs, and decreasing farm incomes.  \n \n8.  The key problems affecting the project area include (i) low agricultural productivity and \nsustainability,  (ii)  land  degradation  and  diminishing  returns  from  agricultural  inputs, \n(iii) vulnerability of farmers to price fluctuations and natural disasters, and (iv) lack of adequate \nworking  capital  and  long-term  financing  for  agroenterprises.  Farming  on  steep  slopes  has \nbecome common due to the combined effect of population expansion and poor regulations. \nUneven rainfall and farming on slopes have caused an increase in the scope and intensity of \nwater runoff and soil erosion, and a decline in the capacity to regulate water and hold soil. A \nproblem tree analysis is in Appendix 3.  \n \n9.  Existing public sector extension services provided through local government agriculture \nbureaus have limited outreach and do not deliver adequate technical advice appropriate to \nfarmers' needs. In the townships, the ratio of technicians to farmers is around 1 to 2,100. They \nlack sufficient resources to provide effective service delivery, and have limited access to up-to-\ndate research and extension information. Supply chains are increasingly being organized for \nproduct quality, uniformity, timely delivery, certification, and traceability. Without organized and \neffective extension services and linkages to enterprises, farmers will be forced to sell their \nproduce to secondary channels with no price premiums. The PRC's major commercial banks \nand  financial  institutions  concentrate  lending  in  urban  areas  and  nonagriculture  sectors. \nFarmers (especially women) and small agribusinesses are disadvantaged in terms of access to \nformal credit. Most farm expenditures are financed by farmers' savings, and most loans are \nobtained from informal sources (e.g., relatives, friends, moneylenders, and pawnbrokers). Small \nand medium-sized agroenterprises lack access to finance. In 2004, they received less than 10% \nof total bank lending. The failure of the financial sector to effectively support agricultural and \nagribusiness development means that market opportunities\u2014and the associated introduction of \nmore  economically  and  environmentally  sustainable  agricultural  production\u2014are  not  being \nrealized. Under the Project, agroenterprises will be provided with long-term financing, and as is \ntheir current practice, will provide agricultural inputs to farmers on extended terms, recoverable \nat harvest time. \n \n2.  Realization of Market Opportunities \n \n10.  To  address  concerns  about  food  quality  and  safety,  and  promote  good  agricultural \npractices, the PRC initiated the ChinaGAP program, which will eventually match the standards \nof certified producers supplying European markets also known as GLOBALGAP.7 This will \ncomplement  compliance  with  international  standards  already  achieved  by  agroenterprises \nthrough hazard analysis, critical control point, and International Organization for Standardization \ncertification. \n \n11.  Improvements  in  farm  productivity  and  sustainability  will  require  significantly  better \naccess by farmers to stable markets and improved support services. Through contract farming \narrangements, agroenterprises can provide farmers with improved market and price incentives, \nwhile at the same time securing their own raw material supplies to enable them to realize the \ngrowing  market  potential  for  processed  food  products.  However,  agroenterprises  are \nconstrained by limited access to investment finance for the necessary expansion in processing \ncapacity.  Access  of  farms  to  support  services  is  currently  limited  by  low-quality  extension \n                                                 \n7  Due to its expanding international role in establishing good agricultural practices, EurepGAP announced the \nchange in its title and logo to GLOBALGAP in September 2007. \n ", "4   \nservices, including the limited outreach of agricultural information services. The public sector \nneeds to improve the quality of and access to such services. The opportunity exists to improve \nboth  the  quality  and  outreach  of  advisory  and  information  services  through  public\u2013private \npartnerships  in  which  local  and  more  readily  accessible  and  sustainable  private-sector-led \nservices are established through linkages to existing public sector systems. \n \n3.  Policies and Strategies  \n \n12.  The Government\u2019s 11th FYP shifts the emphasis of economic and social development \npolicies  away  from  the  growth  orientation  of  previous  plans,  and  instead  emphasizes \nsustainability, based on broader and more inclusive rural development and social programs in \nthe context of an increasingly market-oriented economy. The objective of the FYP is to achieve \ngreater  balance  between  (i)  urban  and  rural  areas,  (ii)  geographic  regions,  (iii) economic \nsectors, (iv) economic and social development, and (v) economic growth and protection of the \nenvironment. Continuing the emphasis on development of the agriculture sector, in January \n2006 the Government published its strategy calling for greater efforts to address the rural \nproblems of about 900 million rural people by increasing the importance of grain production, \nproduct safety, infrastructure, support services including research and extension, social welfare, \nand  governance  (footnote  3).  The  strategy  emphasizes  that  (i)  \u201cdragon-head\u201d  enterprises8 \nshould work in partnership with farmers to share benefits, (ii) small-scale water projects in \nmountainous areas should combat drought through rainwater harvesting, and (iii) water-saving \nirrigation should be developed. ADB\u2019s strategic objectives and operations (as reflected in the \n2008\u20132010  country  partnership  strategy)9 are  consistent  with  the  11th  FYP.  ADB\u2019s  future \noperations in the PRC will focus on rural development, environment, energy conservation, urban \ndevelopment,  and  regional  cooperation.  ADB  will  mobilize  more  resources  and  develop \ndiversified instruments to meet the demand for balanced development among regions, and \nbetween rural and urban areas. \n \n4.  External Assistance \n \n13.  Within the project area, external assistance has included projects in the agriculture and \nnatural  resources  sector,  with  numerous  projects  financed  by  the  World  Bank  including  \n(i)  Henan  Agriculture  Development  Project  (1991),  (ii)  Gansu  and  Xinjiang  Pastoral \nDevelopment Project (2003), (iii) Smallholder Cattle Development Project (1999 in 4 provinces), \n(iv) Agricultural Support Services Project (1993 in 19 provinces), (v) Agriculture Technology \nTransfer Project (2005 in 5 provinces), and (vi) Shandong Agricultural Development Project \n(1989). In addition, the ongoing Henan Afforestation Project financed by the Japan Bank for \nInternational  Cooperation  includes  the  establishment  of  protection  forest  and  tree  crops \n(orchards),  timber  cultivation,  and  capacity  building.  The  ongoing  Henan  Province  Small \nHousehold Project, financed by German development cooperation through KfW, includes the \nintroduction of soil and water conservation methods to support farmers affected by mountain \nclosures  and  grazing  bans.  ADB's  West  Henan  Agriculture  Development  Project10 was \nimplemented in July 2001 and included livestock development, water resource development and \na  water  supply  plant,  horticulture  development,  upgrading  of  information  for  farmers,  and \ntraining of extension workers and farmers. ADB\u2019s ongoing Efficient Utilization of Agricultural \n                                                 \n8  Established in mid-1990s to develop agriculture industries, designated dragon-head enterprises receive limited \ngrant start-up support from the national, provincial, and county governments and access to short-term commercial \nloans to develop partnerships with farm households and businesses. \n9  ADB. 2008.

", "  5\nWastes Project,11 which involves the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) and four provinces, has \ndemonstrated that with strong national, provincial, and local commitment and coordination, and \nearly project awareness and training among participants, such projects can be implemented \nsuccessfully. ADB\u2019s Capacity Building to Combat Land Degradation Project,12 the first project \nunder  the  PRC\u2013Global  Environment  Fund  Partnership  on  Land  Degradation  in  Dryland \nEcosystems, is ongoing in six provinces and autonomous regions: Gansu, Inner Mongolia, \nNingxia, Qinghai, Shaanxi, and Xinjiang. Major projects in the sector supported by external \nassistance are in Appendix 4. \n \n5.  Lessons  \n \n14.  A sustainable rural development approach can reduce the rural\u2013urban income gap and \nlift  the  poor  out  of  poverty  if  the  project  (i)  provides  low-income  rural  producers  in \nenvironmentally fragile areas with higher incomes through market-driven opportunities, and  \n(ii)  is  supported  by  major  stakeholders  with  effective  institutional  mechanisms  and \narrangements. Success factors in previous ADB,13 World Bank, and other international finance \ninstitution projects include (i) flexibility in design that allows stakeholders to revise planned \nactivities to respond to market demand; (ii) high private sector participation and the freedom to \noperate on a commercial basis; (iii) strong ownership by project stakeholders including private \nenterprises, farmers, and local government implementing agencies (IAs); (iv) capacity building \nin  advisory  and  other  support  services  to  facilitate  the  adoption  of  new  technologies  and \npractices, in particular among small-scale and poor farmers; (v) effective project management, \nmonitoring, and evaluation; (vi) participatory strategies such as simple watershed management \napproaches and solutions to land degradation problems with farmers\u2019 involvement; and (vii) \npromotion of sustainable farming techniques on marginal land. \n \n15.  Some of the important lessons from ADB\u2019s experience in dryland management include \n(i) poverty can encourage nonsustainable agriculture and other income-generating activities, \nand vice versa; (ii) soil and water management are critical to improving yields, productivity, and \nsustainable activities; (iii) livestock management is important to discourage destructive open \ngrazing practices; and (iv) institutional arrangements must be in place to educate farmers and \nrural inhabitants on best practices. All project provinces, counties, cities, and districts have had \nexperience implementing similar projects. The outputs and lessons from this assistance can be \nshared with Gansu, Henan, and Shandong provinces. In the evaluation of operations in the rural \ndevelopment and natural resources sector in the PRC, ADB's 2007 country assistance program \nevaluation14 identified several issues relevant to the Project: (i) in the past, ADB\u2019s commercial \nactivities, such as agro-industrial and agroprocessing projects, tended to be less successful \nbecause they relied on the capacity of untested private enterprises; (ii) the PRC has been \nreluctant  to  borrow  for  agricultural  projects  on  ordinary  capital  resources  terms  due  to \ninsufficient financial rates of return and difficulty servicing debt; and (iii) failure of onlending to \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2002.

This Project was selected for a case \nstudy because it adopted private enterprises to promote rural development and poverty reduction. ADB rated it \n\u201chighly successful.\u201d \n14 ADB. 2007. Country Assistance Program Evaluation for the People's Republic of China: Success Drives Demand \nfor More Innovative and Responsive Services. Manila. \n ", "6   \nnewly formed agroenterprises. The project completion report for the Fujian Soil Conservation \nand  Rural  Development  Project15 cites  a  number  of  problems  common  to  such  projects, \nincluding (i) changing market trends; (ii) location problems in relation to raw material supply; and \n(iii) inappropriate financing terms that (a) failed to reflect agroenterprise cash flow and required \nloan repayments to start immediately (prior to full operation of the facilities installed with project \nloan funds); (b) included an interest spread for the finance bureau, which drove the resulting \nend-borrower  interest  rate  above  domestic  market  rates;  and  (c)  neglected  the  need  for \narrangements for complementary working capital finance to be in place. The project completion \nreport for the Hainan Agriculture and Natural Resources Development Project16 identifies the \nmajor failure of the Project as being due to the establishment of four new private enterprises \nspecifically for project implementation that were not well established and managed. The major \nrecommendations are (i) project design should be demand-driven, and (ii) sufficiently strong and \nexperienced agroenterprises should be included. \n \n16.  The project design addresses these issues by identifying agroenterprises that satisfy \nfinancial, economic, environmental, and social criteria. Their investments proposed under the \nProject  were  analyzed  during  project  preparation  and  found  to  be  viable.  This  removes \nresponsibility for investment appraisal from local finance bureaus that are not qualified for such \ntasks. The agroenterprises concerned have (i) a strong record of success in food processing \nwith at least 5 years experience; (ii) well-established domestic and international markets, and \nsound  marketing  experience  and  strategies  to  respond  to  shifting  market  trends;  and  \n(iii)  upstream  linkages  with  farmers  within  their  locality  to  ensure  a  stable  supply  of  raw \nmaterials.  They  are  private  sector  entities  rather  than  state-owned  enterprises,  which  are \ntypically inefficient and poorly managed. The project completion report for the Fujian project also \nnotes that agroenterprises provide job opportunities more suitable for women (footnote 15). In \naddition, a recent ADB evaluation study17 shows that successful poverty reduction involves \nlinking the poor to commercial value-adding enterprises, and generating off-farm employment. \n \n17.  An ADB TA report18 identifies similar lessons, specifically that viable enterprises can \nreceive commercial funding without the need for subsidies or special considerations. However, \nwhere financial market failure exists, development partners and governments can address this \nby  creating  specific  financial  facilities  (loans,  equity,  and  guarantees)  that  assist  private \nagroenterprises. Long-term capital, in particular, is needed because of the lead time to full \nproduction of agroenterprises. Because of the lead time, the provision of long-term capital \nshould not be subsidized. Under the Project, the terms and conditions of such financing will be \nrelated to a realistic repayment schedule for each participating agroenterprise. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n18.  The expected impact of the Project is reduced rural poverty in 27 counties, cities, and \ndistricts of Gansu, Henan, and Shandong provinces, with increased incomes and livelihood \nopportunities resulting from sustainable use of land and water resources. This impact will be \nmeasured through increases in per capita net income and reduced number of poor in the project \n                                                 \n15 ADB. 2003.

The  impact  is  expected  to  benefit  rural  households  in  poor \ncounties, cities, and districts experiencing continuous degradation of agricultural land resources. \n \n19.  The outcome of the Project will be increased agricultural productivity through adoption of \nsustainable  farming  practices  in  the  project  area.  Through  partnerships  between \nagroenterprises, farmers, and local governments, the Project will facilitate farmer access to \nfinance, technology, and markets so that higher-value agricultural products can be produced \nusing sustainable agricultural practices\u2014including conservation agriculture\u2014which will improve \nfarm incomes while reducing the rate of land degradation. The expansion of agroprocessing \nenterprises  will  increase  rural  value-added  and  off-farm  employment  opportunities,  and \ncontribute  to  increasing  rural  incomes.  Agroenterprises  will  experience  increased  sales  of \nprocessed products into existing and new domestic and export markets. This will ensure their \nsustainability and the stability of market outlets and prices for farmers. Viable partnerships \nbetween agroenterprises and farmers will help improve the security of food supply within the \nproject area and reduce the risk of food scarcity of vulnerable populations. \n \n20.  A holistic approach to addressing constraints in production, processing, and provision of \nsupport services and investment finance will address natural resource degradation and promote \nlong-term sustainability and profitability of higher-value agricultural production and processing. \nThis approach is fully consistent with national and local economic and social development \npolicies and the 11th FYP, which builds upon the work of earlier plans to promote soil and water \nconservation,  crop  diversification,  and  investment  in  sustainable  agricultural  technologies. \nPromoting poverty reduction and environmental sustainability continues to be one of ADB\u2019s \nmajor strategic thrusts. \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n1.  Agroenterprise and Farm Partnership Improvements \n \n21.  The principal output of the Project is the promotion of financially and environmentally \nsustainable agriculture in dryland areas through partnerships between private agroenterprises \nand smallholder farmers. Poverty is seen as a cause of land degradation (and vice versa), and \nimproved access to inputs, technologies, technical advice, training, and income opportunities \nwill enable farmers to adopt appropriate and sustainable farming practices. To enable farmers to \nimprove incomes and agricultural practices, the Project will link them to growing markets. The \nProject will also result in productivity improvements. \n \na.  Subcomponent 1A: Enhanced Agricultural Production  \n \n22.  The Project will develop about 29 partnerships between agroenterprises and farmers to \nstrengthen food production, processing capacity, and competitiveness in Gansu, Henan, and \nShandong provinces to take advantage of growing domestic and export markets. The Project \nwill focus on 27 counties, cities, and districts in the three provinces (7 in Gansu, 12 in Henan, \nand 8 in Shandong). The counties, cities, and districts in Gansu are all located in Tianshui city \nand municipality. The Project helps scale up the contract farming mechanism and the inclusion \nof three provinces does not add complexity to project management for either agroenterprises or \nprovincial  government  IAs.  By  working  with  farmers,  the  participating  agroenterprises  will \ndirectly benefit about 600,000 farm households and improve the production capacity of about \n120,000 ha. These enterprises are currently working with another 850,000 farm households \nusing contract farming arrangements. Farmers will convert their existing cultivation of low-\n ", "8   \nyielding  and  low-value  food  crops  to  higher-value  crops  for  the  market  and  their  own \nconsumption.  \n \n23.  The current partnerships are based on the principles of contract farming in the PRC. \nFarm households, usually in a contiguous land area, work under contract on an individual \nhousehold basis with an agroenterprise to produce agricultural outputs at a guaranteed price \ndependent on a specified quality. The agroenterprise provides inputs to the farmers (such as \norganic fertilizer, planting material, and irrigation equipment), and the cost of these inputs is \ndeducted  from  the  value  of  the  output.  Written  contracts  are  typically  used  for  new  farm \nhouseholds,  but  informal  contracts  are  the  norm  when  the  two  parties  have  a  long-term \nrelationship and trust. The contracts are usually for one season and are considered fair based \non indications of the responsibilities of the parties and a guaranteed price subject to quality \nstandards. The contract price is typically 10%\u201315% above wholesale market prices because of \nthe higher quality of the output supplied directly to the agroenterprise for processing and final \nproduct marketing and sale. The contracts are legal and honored by local courts for arbitration. \nIn  addition  to  agricultural  inputs,  agroenterprises  currently  provide  support  services  to \ncontracted farmers in the form of technical advice and training to improve yields, production, \nand quality. Public sector extension services and training are also provided on a limited basis to \nleading farmers, and are generally considered to be deficient in the project area. The Project will \nimprove  the  support  services  provided  to  farmers  by  agroenterprises  and  public  sector \nextension agents. \n \n24.  The enterprises were chosen on the basis of application of agreed selection criteria from \na long list of about 150 enterprises; and include financial and economic performance data based \non audited statements, and environmental and social criteria. Appendix 5 contains the details of \nthe selection criteria and the due diligence analysis. Sustainable production and processing \npartnerships according to the dragon-head concept will be used to develop crops and other \noutputs, which are processed and marketed by the enterprise. Examples of enterprise activities \ninclude food crops, horticulture crops, and small livestock products processing. The enterprises \nwill be provided with long-term financing to expand their food processing, quality assurance, and \nmarketing operations. Farmers will benefit from the partnerships with profitable and expanding \nagroenterprises through higher prices for their outputs and improved yields and production. No \nland acquisition will be needed; all production and processing expansions will be on existing \nfarm and agroenterprise land. \n \nb.  Subcomponent 1B: Private Support Services to Farmers  \n \n25.  The Project will support strengthening of farmers\u2019 knowledge and capabilities to develop \nstrong, business-oriented approaches that are provided directly from the agroenterprises. This \nwill complement agricultural extension services provided by the public sector (para. 27\u201329). \nFarmers will receive agricultural extension advice, new technologies, improved access to inputs, \nand increased market access by working in partnership with participating agroenterprises. The \nagroenterprises  and  county  project  management  offices  (PMOs)  identified  low-income \nhouseholds requiring strengthened knowledge and capabilities. The small and uniform farm size \nthat characterizes the project area is not viewed as a major constraint to successful adoption of \nscale-neutral  technologies.  The  average  farmer  income  will  increase  by  about  15%\u201325%. \nTechnological improvements include adoption of (i) improved seeds, varieties, and breeds; \n(ii) conservation  agriculture  techniques  such  as  returning  crop  residues  to  the  soil  and \nminimizing tillage; (iii) water-saving technologies such as drip irrigation, sprayers, and pipes;  \n(iv) use of organic fertilizer and minimizing the use of chemical fertilizer, pesticide and herbicide;  \n(v) advanced postharvest and processing equipment; (vi) intercropping with tree crops and ", "  9\ngrape vineyards; and (vii) upgraded vegetable greenhouses. An element of this commercially \nbased relationship will be that these service facilities will be sustainable after project completion \nwithout  reliance  on  any  government  funding,  and  function  on  a  revenue-generating,  cost-\nrecovery basis.  \n \n26.  To  increase  competitiveness,  the  Project,  through  the  agroenterprises,  will  provide \nadvisory service and input support to farmers. Infrastructure provided by agroenterprises to \nimprove agricultural productivity and product quality will include establishing and improving \nthree agricultural extension and technology transfer centers in Henan, two organic fertilizer-\nmixing facilities in Henan and Shandong, one expanded manufacturing plant and 30 machinery \nservice stations in Henan, one seed production center in Shandong, three agricultural produce \ninformation centers in Henan and Shandong, one agricultural product testing center in Henan, \nfour expanded fruit and vegetable markets in Gansu and Henan, and four farmer associations in \nHenan  and  Shandong.  These  outputs  will  be  an  integral  part  of  the  relationship  between \nenterprises  and  farmers,  both  individually  and  through  voluntary  participation  in  farmer \nassociations. \n \n2.  Project Support and Management \n \na.  Subcomponent 2A: Public Sector Support to Farmers \n \n27.  Local government support services will work with agroenterprises and farmers to expand \nenvironment-friendly  farming  practices.  This  will  improve  access  to  advisory  services  and \ntraining for farmers operating on a project production basis. Farmer training will be undertaken \nby the extension staff of provincial and county agriculture bureaus assisted by lead farmers \nselected from villages where production bases are located. The staff and lead farmers will be \nprovided  with  training  in  improved  practices  relevant  to  (i)  financially  and  environmentally \nsustainable crop cultivation techniques and farm management, and (ii) development of advice \nand training for delivery skills. This will allow training to cover the proposed 66,200 households, \nwith up to 80,000 farmers trained annually by the end of the Project, including both project and \nnonproject farmers. The provincial governments currently implement agricultural risk mitigation \nmeasures to assist farmers in the event of natural disasters (e.g., snowstorms, floods, and \ndrought) through the provision of compensation (cash and in-kind inputs), training, and services. \nIn addition to minimum price supports, agroenterprises assure contract farmers a guaranteed \nminimum price at the time of harvest or upon delivery. Also, the public sector provides farmers \nwith training in improved farming practices (such as organic cultivation methods) and testing of \nproducts at market centers to ensure safety and quality. These measures will be provided to \nfarmers under the Project using counterpart funds. \n \nb.  Subcomponent 2B: Demonstration of Sustainable Farming Practices \n \n28.  The Project will be complemented by a $350,000 grant from the Spanish Cooperation \nFund for Technical Assistance to demonstrate sustainable farming practices (Appendix 6). The \ngrant  will  strengthen  the  implementation  capacity  of  IAs  and  the  project  performance \nmanagement  system  required  for  successful  implementation  of  the  Project.  The  provincial \ngovernments will finance improvements of existing office and training facilities, training materials \nand equipment to demonstrate improved agricultural technologies, and counterpart staff. The \ngrant  will  improve  sustainable  farming  practices  to  increase  farm productivity,  reduce  land \ndegradation,  adopt  sustainable  land  management  practices,  assess  the  impact  of  climate \nchange on land degradation (particularly in Gansu province), and improve water conservation. \nThe grant administered by ADB will support the delivery of support services to improve yields, \n ", "10  \nagricultural productivity, and environment-friendly practices on an individual household and \nfarmer-group  basis,  including  conservation  agriculture,  water  harvesting,  and  collection \ntechnologies. Implementation methods will draw on proven participatory and holistic approaches \nincluding participatory watershed management, group-based extension services and farmer \nfield  schools,  and  successful  examples  of  agroenterprises  working  with  farmers  using  the \ncontract farming relationships.  \n \nc.  Subcomponent 2C: Project Management \n \n29.  Local governments will establish and provide adequate project management support \ncomplete with logistics facilities and technical staff for effective provincial and county project \nimplementation. MOA, the Executing Agency; the three provincial PMOs; and the 27 county \nPMOs responsible for project implementation were extensively involved in preparing the Project, \nincluding applying the criteria for selecting the agroenterprises and partnerships with farmers. \nThey  have  experience  in  implementing  externally  and  government-financed  programs  and \nprojects in the sector. All agencies involved in the Project, including the agroenterprises, have \nreceived  annual  training  from  the  Government  on  technological  improvements,  project \nmanagement,  and  financial  management.  During  project  implementation,  the  PMOs  will \nundertake monitoring of key impact, outcome, and output indicators. Counterpart financing will \nbe used to provide (i) training to these institutions in the application of criteria for agroenterprise \nparticipation  in  the  Project,  (ii)  effective  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  performance  of \nagroenterprises and local government support services under the Project, and (iii) effective \ndelivery of financial and economic benefits to farmers. ADB will provide training on imprest \naccount  management,  project  implementation,  and  project  performance  management.  The \nproject staff will undertake awareness workshops on mobilizing farmers and disseminating \ninformation relating to the Project. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n30.  Environmental  and  Social  Benefits.  The  Project  will  generate  significant \nenvironmental and social benefits. It addresses rural poverty and agricultural land degradation \nin an integrated and financially sustainable manner, in which farmers receive benefits from \nmeasures to reduce land degradation and improve agricultural productivity, and share the costs \nof conservation measures. The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics \nis  successfully  applying  this  model  in  the  PRC  to  promote  congruence  between  poverty \nreduction and environmental improvement. The institute received earlier ADB TA19 to promote \nthe watershed development approach with farmers and local governments in the PRC and other \ncountries. The Project focuses on poorer dryland areas where impacts on incomes, poverty \nreduction,  and  agricultural  productivity  can  be  expected  to  be  high.  Improvements  to  the \nenvironment  will  be  realized  through  improved  and  increased  agricultural  productivity,  and \nfarming practices that (i) improve soil nutrition and quality; (ii) reduce wind and water erosion of \nsoil, and reduce water runoff; (iii) increase water retention in fragile soil; and (iv) reduce soil \nsalinity. The lesson from this model will be adopted in the Project. \n \n31.  Public\u2013Private  Partnerships.  The  Project  will  strengthen  existing  public\u2013private \npartnerships between county agriculture bureaus, agroenterprises, and farmers in the delivery \nof key farm support services in extension, information, and soil and water analysis to increase \ncompetitiveness and improve management and operations. The Project will reduce poverty and \nprovide  environmental  benefits  without  reliance  on  grants  or  subsidies.  The  public\u2013private \npartnership  model  provides  a  channel  through  which  an  integrated  package  of  financial, \n                                                 \n19 ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance for the Seventh Agriculture and Natural Resources Research at International \nAgricultural Research Centers. Manila (TA 6067-REG). ", " 11\ntechnical, and market support can be provided to farmers during implementation, and with little \nincremental  requirement  for  public  funds.  The  public\u2013private  partnership  between  farmers, \nagroenterprises, and local government agencies is a special feature of the Project, utilizing the \ntried and tested application of contract farming on a large scale. Such partnerships are key to \nsecuring  the  regular  supply  of  crops  and  livestock  products,  improving  productivity,  and \nensuring adequate incomes to farmers and enterprises. \n \n32.  Contract Farming. The Project will build upon the existing concept of the dragon-head \nenterprise  to  develop  mutually  beneficial  partnerships  between  farmers,  farmer  groups, \nenterprises, and local governments (footnote 8). Although only eight (28%) agroenterprises in \nthe Project qualify as dragon heads due to their relatively small size, all participating enterprises \nfollow the dragon-head model and have sufficient capacity to expand operations with farmers \nunder the Project. The Project will introduce long-term financing to enterprises and easier \naccess to public sector support services to contracted farmers. Farmers and enterprises may \nhave (i) a sales contract to minimize price risks, (ii) shareholding, and (iii) provision of farm \ninputs to be repaid in kind (farm produce). By working in several provinces, the Project will \nenable greater sharing of experiences and lessons. The Project has strong national, provincial, \ncounty, and village government support. \n \n33.  Contract farming has been successfully practiced in the PRC for the last 10 years. The \nProject will promote the contract farming approach through the establishment of production \nbases linked to agroenterprises. This has the potential to provide farmers with higher product \nprices and incomes, compared with those of farmers not engaged in contract farming. It will \nimprove farmer access to stable market outlets increase farm incomes, and provide a stable \nsupply of consistent quality raw materials to agroenterprises to satisfy market demand. Farm\u2013\nmarket linkages will be enhanced and transaction costs for farmers and agroenterprises will be \nreduced. To ensure that the poor and households headed by women also benefit from the \nProject, ways of providing incentives to include them in farmer associations and informal groups \nwill be explored.  \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n \n34.  The project investment cost is estimated at $204.69 million including taxes and duties of \n$9.36 million, physical and price contingencies, interest, and other charges. A summary of cost \nestimates is shown in Table 1 and details are provided in Appendix 7. \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem    Amounta \nA.  Base Costb    \n  1.

Financing Plan \n \n35.  The Government has requested a loan of $83,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term including a grace period \nof 5 years, an interest rate to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility for US dollar loans, a commitment charge of 0.15% per \nannum on undisbursed funds, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the loan and \nproject agreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to \nborrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, \nand (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in \nreliance  on  any  communication  or  advice  from  ADB.  The  Spanish  Cooperation  Fund  for \nTechnical Assistance will provide grant cofinancing equivalent to $350,000, representing 0.17% \nof  the  project  cost,  to  be  administered  by  ADB.  The  assistance  is  to  strengthen  the \nimplementation capacity of IAs and the project performance management system required for \nsuccessful project implementation. The financing plan is summarized in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Amount  % \nAsian Development Bank Loan  83.00  40.55 \nSpanish Cooperation Fund for Technical Assistance     0.35  0.17 \nNational Government   0.90  0.44 \nProvincial and County Governments  9.01  4.40 \nAgroenterprises  97.83  47.80 \nFarmers  13.60  6.64 \n  Total  204.69  100.00 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n36.  The Borrower is the PRC. On behalf of the Government, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) \nwill enter into subsidiary loan agreements with Gansu, Henan, and Shandong provinces as \nsubborrowers  of  the  proceeds  of  the  ADB  loan:  Gansu,  $25  million  base  cost;  Henan, \n$36 million base cost; and Shandong, $22 million base cost on the same terms and conditions \nas the ADB loan. The provinces will onlend the entire proceeds of the loan to the county finance \nbureaus on the same interest and commitment charges as the ADB loan for further onlending to \nprivate agroenterprises on the same interest and commitment charges as the ADB loan but with \nan additional interest rate spread of up to 0.2%, if applicable, to cover possible loss and delay in \nrepayment, for a 10- to 15-year term including a grace period of up to 5 years. The participating \nagroenterprises will pay the interest charges to the county finance bureaus for onward payment \nto ADB through the provincial governments and MOF. The agroenterprises will bear all interest \ncharges  on  the  loan  and  the  foreign  exchange  risk.  The  flow  of  funds  and  onlending \narrangements are shown in Appendix 8. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n37.  MOA will coordinate and supervise all implementation activities through the existing \nNational Project Coordination committee, comprising representatives of MOA, MOF, and the \nNational Development and Reform Commission. MOA has designated the Foreign Economic \nCooperation  Center  to  be  the  central  PMO  for  the  Project.  MOA  will  be  responsible  for \ninterfacing with ADB, MOF, and the National Development and Reform Commission. MOA will \nbe in charge of overall coordination and monitoring of the Project. Provincial and county leading ", " 13\ngroups have been constituted and are functioning. The provincial governments will be the \nprovincial executing agencies, responsible for supervising and monitoring project activities. The \ncounty,  city,  and  district  governments  will  be  the  IAs  for  all  project  components  and  will \nsupervise implementation activities. MOA will provide technical guidance and backstopping to \nthe provincial executing agencies and will coordinate implementation of the grant provided by \nthe Spanish Cooperation Fund for Technical Assistance. \n \n38.  The  provincial  and  county  PMOs  currently  guide  the  provincial  and  county  leading \ngroups to oversee project implementation and resolve issues. These leading groups comprise \nstaff of the PMOs and finance, agriculture, environmental protection, and poverty reduction \nbureaus. The IAs\u2019 major tasks include (i) overseeing implementation of all components, outputs, \nand activities; (ii) developing annual work programs and budgets in consultation with MOA; (iii) \nsupervising  compliance  of  procurement  with  ADB  guidelines;  (iv)  maintaining  consolidated \naccounts  including  developing  a  system  to  track  all  financial  transactions  with  enterprise \nsubborrowers; (v) preparing and submitting applications to ADB for withdrawing funds from the \nloan account; (vi) monitoring physical and financial progress including benefit flows to intended \nbeneficiaries,  and  submitting  reports  to  provincial  executing  agencies;  and  (vii)  ensuring \nadequate  and  timely  counterpart  financing.  A  major  role  of  the  national  and  provincial \ngovernments will be to ensure that participating farmers receive the intended benefits in terms \nof  productivity  and  income  increases  through  favorable  contracts  and  prices  with  the \nenterprises, and that poverty is reduced in the project area. The provincial, municipal, and \ncounty agencies (finance bureaus, agriculture bureaus, and environmental protection bureaus) \nwill assist the PMOs. The organization chart is in Appendix 9. \n \n39.  The  agroenterprises  will  implement  the  activities,  working  with  farmers  and  farmer \nassociations to establish and develop the production areas or bases and processing facilities, \nand will be responsible for all marketing activities. Farmer associations are voluntary groups of \nfarmers working together to improve agricultural productivity, product quality, and marketing \nbased on available market information. Therefore, farmers can work in partnership directly with \nagroenterprises and indirectly through farmer associations, although contracts are only between \nagroenterprises and individual farmers. Farmer associations elect their own officers and are \nself-financing.  The  implementation  capacity  of  the  institutions  and  enterprises  involved  is \nconsidered adequate given their current staffing, incremental staffing plans, previous experience \nwith  externally  financed  projects  and  providing  financial  support  to  agroenterprises,  and \nprevious training and planned training under the Project. The agroenterprises were selected \nusing agreed selection criteria and all have at least 5 years experience in their current activities. \nThe county, city, and district governments will provide loans ranging from about $0.7 million to \n$8.6 million to the agroenterprises (Appendix 5). \n \n40.  An  agreement  will  be  entered  into  between  each  participating  enterprise  and \nparticipating farmers. Many of these contracts are already in place, facilitating early project \nimplementation.  Under  the  agreement,  a  participating  enterprise  will  be  responsible  for  \n(i)  undertaking,  in  collaboration  with  participating  farmers,  the  necessary  work  to  establish \nproduction and install farm infrastructure and equipment; (ii) providing seedlings, fertilizers, \npesticides, and technology and guidance to participating farmers in production and postharvest \nactivities,  with  associated  fees  agreed  to  by  participating  farmers  and  the  participating \nenterprise; and (iii) purchasing the outputs produced by participating farmers, at the higher rate \nof the prevailing market price or the protected price agreed at the beginning of each year. \nParticipating farmers will be obliged to (i) carry out land improvement work under the guidance \nof the participating enterprise, (ii) ensure high-quality production stipulated by the participating \nenterprise, (iii) sell produced outputs to the participating enterprise in accordance with the \n ", "14  \nagreement,  and  (iv)  repay  the  cost  of  the  inputs  and  goods  provided  by  the  participating \nenterprise by deducting the charges from the payment made by the participating enterprise for \nthe participating farmers' outputs. In addition, contracts between agroenterprises and county \nagriculture bureaus will be developed for the provision of technical support services for farm \nproduction  and  enterprise-processing  activities.  All  provincial  and  county  agencies  and \nenterprises  involved  in  the  Project  have  received  annual  training  on  technological \nimprovements,  project  management,  and  financial  management.  The  Project  will  provide \nadditional training. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n41.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years  from  June  2009  to  June  2014.  An \nimplementation schedule is presented in Appendix 10. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n42.  All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Contracts for goods estimated \nto exceed $1 million and contracts for works estimated to exceed $10 million will be procured \nusing international competitive bidding procedures. Contracts for goods and works estimated to \ncost less than the international competitive bidding values but more than $100,000 will be \nprocured  through  national  competitive  bidding  procedures  in  accordance  with  the  PRC \nTendering and Bidding Law, 1999, subject to modifications agreed with ADB. Contracts for \ngoods  and  works  estimated  to  cost  $100,000  or  less  will  be  procured  using  shopping \nprocedures.  More  details  are  provided  in  Appendix  11.  The  relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) will be included in all procurement documents \nand contracts. \n \n43.  In accordance with ADB procedures, an assessment was made of the procurement \ncapacity of MOA and other project agencies. The assessment concludes that the IAs have \nadequate procurement experience in domestic- and ADB-financed projects, but that MOA and \nimplementing agency staff require training on ADB procurement procedures and requirements \nto ensure compliance with ADB procurement guidelines. MOA and implementing agency staff \nwill attend ADB-sponsored courses and seminars on procurement and project implementation. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n44.  The cofinancing grant from the Spanish Cooperation Fund for Technical Assistance will \ncover the costs of consultants comprising about 5 person-months of international and about \n25 person-months of national experts to be recruited through a firm using the quality- and cost- \nbase selection method with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. This will cover (i) preparation and \ndelivery of training (about 50 short courses) to farmers and agriculture technicians in the project \narea on participatory soil and water management, and sustainable agriculture; (ii) support to \nlocal institutions in Gansu, Henan, and Shandong provinces in collaboration with the training \ncourse delivery; and (iii) training materials. The national and provincial governments will provide \noffice and training facilities, domestic travel, counterpart agency support service staff, and \nmaterials and equipment to demonstrate sustainable agricultural technology. The provincial \ngovernments, agroenterprises, and farmer communities will cover the costs of implementing \nsustainable agriculture action plans produced from the training. All recruitment will follow ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Details are in \nAppendix 6. ", " 15\n5.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n \n45.  The Government and the provinces requested retroactive financing since many of the \nagroenterprises  are  ready  to  start  project  implementation  with  contracted  farmers.  The \nGovernment was advised that retroactive financing could only apply up to 20% of the ADB loan \nwith respect to expenditures incurred not earlier than 12 months before the signing of the loan \nagreement. All contracts proposed for advanced action and retroactive financing, relating to the \nexpansion of production bases and operation of the PMOs, will be undertaken in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The national and \nprovincial governments were advised that approval of this request does not commit ADB to \nfinancing the Project. \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n46.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the Government, MOA, \nprovincial  governments,  and  IAs.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or though its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan and grant regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts \nfinanced by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of \nADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency,  provincial \ngovernments, IAs, and agroenterprises; and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other \nservice providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n47.  The  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  facilitate  project \nimplementation and flow of funds, three imprest accounts for the loan (one for each province) \nwill be set up in commercial banks acceptable to ADB upon loan effectiveness, managed by the \nprovinces. The initial advances to be deposited will not exceed either 6 months of estimated \nexpenditures or 10% of the loan proceeds allocated to the provinces, whichever is lower. The \ndirect payment procedures will apply for large contracts. If the Government initially funds eligible \nexpenditures from its own resources, the reimbursement procedure will be used. To expedite \nfunds flow and simplify the documentation process, the statement-of-expenditure procedure will \nbe used to liquidate and replenish the imprest accounts and reimburse eligible expenditures not \nexceeding $100,000 per individual payment from agroenterprise to supplier or contractor under \ncivil works and goods contracts. The payments in excess of the statement-of-expenditure ceiling \nwill  be  reimbursed,  liquidated,  or  replenished  based  on  the  full  supporting  documentation \nprocess.  Finance  bureaus  will  disburse  to  agroenterprises  on  a  needs  basis.  The \nagroenterprises will be responsible for repayments to the IAs, and will provide collateral to \nsecure  loans  from  their  respective  implementing  agency.  The  IAs  will  be  responsible  for \nrepayment to provincial governments. A financial management assessment of MOA and the IAs \nis presented in Supplementary Appendix B. The assessment concludes that they satisfy ADB\u2019s \nfinancial management requirements for executing and IAs and, as government offices in the \nhierarchy under MOF, they have satisfactory financial management capability. \n \n \n \n \n ", "16  \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n48.  MOA and the PMOs involved in project implementation will maintain separate records \nand accounts that identify goods and services from the loan proceeds, financing resources \nreceived, expenditures incurred, and use of local funds. These accounts will be established and \nmaintained  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles  and  internationally  accepted \naccounting standards. The provincial governments will review and consolidate these accounts \nand  have  them  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  practices  by  the \nGovernment\u2019s sovereign audit agency or other auditors acceptable to ADB. The audit report will \ninclude a statement verifying whether or not the funds disbursed by ADB were used for the \npurposes for which they were provided, as well as the auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the \nimprest accounts and statement-of-expenditure procedures. Copies of the audited accounts and \nauditor\u2019s report will be submitted to ADB within 6 months after the end of each financial year. \nMOA  will  prepare  consolidated  semi-annual  reports  indicating  progress  made,  problems \nencountered  during  the  period,  steps  taken  or  proposed  to  remedy  the  problems,  and  a \nproposed program of activities with progress expected for the next reporting period. Within 3 \nmonths of physical completion of the Project, MOA will submit a completion report to ADB that \ndescribes achievements in relation to the Project\u2019s expected impact, outcome, and outputs. \nEnterprises participating in the Project and in receipt of loan funds will have their accounts \naudited  and  their  financial  statements  prepared  in  accordance  with  international  financial \nreporting  standards  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  Enterprises  will  make  their  financial \nstatements available to the provincial governments within 3 months of the end of each financial \nyear. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n49.  To monitor the progress of the Project in achieving the planned outcome and outputs, \nMOA  and  the  three  provincial  executing  agencies  will  develop  a  project  performance \nmanagement system (PPMS) to establish benchmark indicators to assess project performance \nand impact. The PPMS will be designed to permit adequate flexibility to adopt remedial action \nregarding  project  design,  schedules,  activities,  and  development  impacts.  It  will  include \nindicators proposed in the design and monitoring framework, and adopt the following agreed \nindicators as a minimum: (i) physical progress of agroenterprise implementation (production \nbase and processing capacity expansion); (ii) changes in crop and livestock varieties and yields \ncompared  with  present;  (iii)  types  and  application  rates  of  fertilizers  and  agrochemicals \ncompared with present; (iv) increases in farm incomes; (v) reduction in poverty incidence, and \ngender and social development; and (vi) reduction in degraded land. The IAs in consultation \nwith each participating agriculture bureau and agroenterprise will develop comprehensive PPMS \nprocedures to systematically generate data on inputs and outputs of project activities; and the \nphysical, socioeconomic, and environmental indicators to measure project impacts. Within the \nPPMS  framework,  the  IAs  will  confirm  achievable  targets,  refine  monitoring  and  recording \narrangements, and establish systems and procedures no later than 6 months after the start of \nthe Project. They will be responsible for analyzing and consolidating the reported data through \nthe management information system, and for reporting the outcome to ADB through quarterly \nprogress reports. \n \n10.  Project Review \n \n50.  In addition to regular monitoring, the Government and ADB will jointly review project \nperformance at least once a year. The review will assess implementation performance and \nachievement of progress toward project outcomes and outputs, financial progress, and issues ", " 17\nand constraints affecting implementation. It will include development of a time-bound action plan \nfor resolution of issues and constraints. ADB and the Government will undertake a midterm \nreview to assess implementation status and take appropriate measures, including modification \nof scope and implementation arrangements, and reallocation of loan proceeds, as appropriate, \nto achieve the Project\u2019s outcomes and impact. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Farm Incomes \n \n51.  Farm incomes will increase due to (i) the adoption of improved production technologies, \nincluding quality seed; shifts in cropping patterns to include high-value crops; judicious use of \nagrochemicals  (fertilizers  and  pesticides);  use  of  organic  fertilizers;  increase  in  irrigation \nefficiencies; improved water and soil conservation; and reduction of postharvest losses; and \n(ii) premium prices received from improved quality of outputs. The incremental income flows \nwere derived from financial analysis of farm investments, which indicated appreciable returns to \ninvestment.  The  value  of  incremental  output  was  adjusted  for  the  associated  costs  and \nrevenues accruing to households that qualified for a premium on quality. \n \n52.  In addition to the qualitative improvements, project beneficiaries will produce additional \nquantities of 100,000 tons (t) of wheat, 80,000 t of wheat products, 10,000 t of corn, 30,000 t of \ncornstarch, 30,000 t of cotton seed and associated products (oil cake and oil), 80,000 t of \nvegetables,  18,000  t  of  organic  vegetables,  and  11,000  t  of  grapes  for  wine  and  juices. \nQualitative improvements will be realized for 80,000 t of fruits, 17,000 t of Chinese dates, \n30,000 t of sweet potatoes, 18,000 t of pepper and garlic, 2,500 t of mushrooms, 540 t of ginko, \n700 t of high-value herbs, 5,000 t each of concentrated soybean proteins and peanut products, \nand 1,000 t of quality vegetable seed. The Project will also support additional production of \n24,000 t of pork, 12,000 t of piglets, 3,000 t of processed beef, 6,000 t of milk, 3,000 t of wool, \n3,000 t of eggs, 2,000 t of honey, and 100,000 t of animal feed. To facilitate production and \nmarketing of farm produce, the Project will support the construction of markets and storage \nfacilities for about 3,700 t of perishable and semiperishable commodities, and packing materials; \nand 120,000 t of organic fertilizers, farm machines, and tools. \n \n53.  At present, about 850,000 farm households are supplying their farm produce to the \nprocessors and other marketing concerns. With project support, about 600,000 additional farm \nhouseholds are expected to benefit with the formalized contract arrangements in terms of \naccess to improved production packages, increased productivity, improved quality of output, \nreduced postharvest losses, and assured fair prices. The total value of additional production of \nprocessed output  is  estimated  as  CNY3.2  billion,  which  will  entail  an  estimated  additional \nincome of CNY600\u2013CNY700 per year per farm household. \n \nB.  Financial Analysis of Agroenterprises \n \n54.  The investments by participating enterprises under the Project include establishment, \nmodernization, and refurbishment of processing lines; and technical support and services to \ncontracted farmers for the supply of improved-quality raw materials. The adoption of farming \nimprovements and associated investments by farmers is contingent on access to improved \ninputs, technical and financial support, and assured fair prices. The Project will provide these to \nthe  contracted  farmers  under  the  partnership arrangements  through  the  existing  extension \nservices and participating enterprises. The contracted farmers will be paid predetermined fair \nprices for the output. Farmers and the enterprises will reasonably share the value added by the \n ", "18  \nProject.  Integration  of  farmers\u2019  inputs  with  the  support  services  and  other  investments  of \nenterprises will  increase  benefits  to  farmers.  Considering  this  feature  of  the  Project,  each \nparticipating agroenterprise's financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is calculated on the basis of \nintegrating activities of constructing a processing plant and associated production base, as well \nas providing support services.  \n \n55.  The FIRRs, computed on an after-tax basis, range from 15% to 22% for the partnerships \nin Henan province, 17% to 25% for the partnerships in Shandong province, and 14% to 25.5% \nfor the partnerships in Gansu province. The FIRR results compare favorably with respective \nweighted average costs of capital, estimated in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for the \nFinancial Analysis and Management of Projects (2005), using the relative proportions of each \nsource  in  total  agroenterprise  financing  and  their  relative  cost.  For  agroenterprise  equity \nfinancing, a rate of 12% is assumed. The resulting weighted average cost of capital is 6.72%. \nThe analysis suggests that the investments are financially viable.  \n \n56.  The sensitivity analysis shows that the FIRRs are relatively robust to adverse changes in \nproject costs and delays in project implementation. However, the FIRRs show a relatively high \nsensitivity to changes in yields and output prices. Special attention will have to be given to \nfactors that may affect yields, and quality of crops and livestock in the project area, such as the \nquality of infrastructure works; maintenance of facilities; and utilization of appropriate crop and \nlivestock production techniques, which will be channeled through technical support and farmers \ntraining in the project area. Strong demand in domestic and international markets suggests that \nthe risks of declines in revenues of this magnitude are small. The past performance and existing \nmanagement  capacity  of  the  agroenterprises  are  sufficient  to  maintain  the  operating  and \nfinancial efficiencies. Based on projected financial statements over the 20 years of the analysis, \nall agroenterprises satisfy financial performance criteria and have satisfactory debt\u2013equity, debt \nservice coverage, current, and quick ratios. The financial analysis is in Appendix 12. \n \nC.  Economic Benefits \n \n57.  Farm output is expected to increase by 20%\u201325%. This will be realized through the \nadoption of improved farm technologies and practices that will lead to (i) increased yields of \ngrains and cotton; vegetables and fruit crops; and other high-value crops such as condiments, \nherbs, medicinal plants, mushrooms, livestock, dairy, and poultry products; (ii) savings in the \nuse  of  agricultural  inputs;  and  (iii)  reduction  of  postharvest  losses.  In  addition,  higher \nproductivity will be realized through higher efficiencies from conserved water and soil resources. \nThe use of inorganic fertilizer is expected to decrease by 20%\u201325% and the use of pesticides by \n25%\u201330%. The use of organic fertilizer is expected to increase by 40%\u201350%. Overall, net farm \nproduction costs are expected to increase, given the larger volume of organic fertilizers that will \nbe applied. However, this will be offset by increased value of outputs and increased prices for \nhigh-quality production. \n \n58.  The Project will generate both direct and indirect benefits. Direct economic benefits are \nderived from increases in farm productivity and diversification of cropping patterns to higher-\nvalue  food,  vegetable,  and  fruit  crops;  increased  livestock  products;  and  increases  in  the \nproduction and marketing of processed products. Indirect economic benefits are derived from \nthe environmental benefits, which will be realized through improved and increased agricultural \nproductivity and farming practices that (i) improve soil nutrition and quality; (ii) reduce wind and \nwater erosion of soil, and reduce water runoff; (iii) increase water retention in fragile soil; and \n(iv) reduce soil salinity. \n ", " 19\n59.  To estimate the Project\u2019s economic viability, the financial investment costs including \nphysical contingencies, were converted to economic costs by adjusting taxes and duties, and \napplying conversion factors to the shares of foreign costs, unskilled and skilled labor, and other \ncosts.  The  resultant  values  represent  the  economic  capital  costs  of  the  Project  using  the \ndomestic price numeraire. All other local currency costs are assumed to equal their economic \ncosts, after deducting taxes and duties. The Project\u2019s estimated economic internal rate of return \naggregated for all the partnerships is about 36.4%, including project management costs. The \neconomic internal rates of return for the individual partnerships exceed the economic cost of \ncapital, which is assumed to be 12%. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the returns to the overall \nProject,  farming  operations,  and  partnerships  are  generally  robust;  while  the  distribution \nanalysis shows a balanced distribution of economic and financial net present value between the \nagroenterprises and farmers. The detailed economic analysis is presented in Appendix 12. \n \nD.  Environmental Impacts \n \n60.  An  environmental  assessment  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  PRC\u2019s \nenvironmental impact assessment system as well as ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). Initial \nand  summary  environmental  examination  reports  were  prepared  including  environmental \nmanagement plans (Supplementary Appendixes E and F). Benefits to the environment will \ninclude (i) improved soil nutrition and quality; (ii) reduced water runoff, and wind and water \nerosion of soil; (iii) increased water retention in fragile soil; and (iv) reduced soil salinity. The \npossible adverse environmental impacts will be prevented or minimized to an acceptable level if \nthe environmental management plan set out in the initial environmental examination and the \nGovernment's environmental impact assessments (EIAs) are effectively implemented.  \n \nE.  Employment \n \n61.  Despite the increasing number of rural residents migrating to urban areas for jobs, \nconsiderable  surplus  labor  exists  in  the  project  area.  Rural  underemployment  in  the  three \nproject provinces is high, estimated at 27 million (3.7 million in Gansu, 13.1 million in Henan, \nand 10.2 million in Shandong). Off-farm income accounts for 40% of per capita net income and \nis increasingly important with more than 25% of rural laborers not fully employed in farming. \nWith the Project, a total of about 128,000 households in Gansu, 218,000 in Henan, and 254,000 \nin Shandong will be engaged in improvements and expansion of farm production bases. This \namounts to about 2.4 million rural residents. Females comprise about 50% of the population in \nthe project area. The Project is expected to generate a total of about 34,200 new jobs in the \nagroenterprises. Currently, more than 40% of employees working in agroprocessing are female, \nand the ratio may increase with the Project as agroprocessors state that women are preferred \nas they tend to maintain product quality standards better than men. \n \nF.  Poverty Impact \n \n62.  The project area covers 27 counties, cities, and districts in three provinces. In 2006, the \naverage  farm  income  in  the  project  area  was  CNY2,247,  63%  of the  national  average  of \nCNY3,587. Institutional constraints (farmer fragmentation and lack of bargaining power) mean \nrising grain prices benefit grain dealers more than farmers, who also face rising farm input costs \nand continuing land degradation. Poverty in the project area is high (27%, including 39% in \nHenan, 21% in Shandong, and 20% in Gansu), and 6% of residents live in absolute poverty \nqualifying  for  minimum  living  guarantee  payments  from  the  Government.  Rural \nunderemployment is high. Off-farm income accounts for 40% of per capita net income and is \nincreasingly important. The rural\u2013urban income ratio was about 35:65 in 2006 and the gap is \n ", "20  \nexpected to widen. With the Project, a total of about 600,000 farm households and about 34,200 \nnewly employed agroprocessing workers will directly benefit. With few assets and average farm \nsize of only about 0.28 ha, farmers are highly vulnerable to the impacts of land degradation and \nnatural or economic shocks, and have little or no ability to cope with the costs and risks of \nchanging to more sustainable farming practices. They have little ability to negotiate, either in \nterms of prices paid for inputs or produce prices on the open market. Strengthening vertical \nrelationships between agroenterprises and farmers can improve farmers\u2019 access to higher-value \nmarkets, technologies, and employment opportunities; and improve transfer efficiencies, supply \nsecurity, and quality control for the enterprise. The per capita income of the project beneficiaries \nis  expected  to  increase  by  CNY122\u2013CNY2,190  per  year  depending  on  the  nature  of  the \npartnership  with  the  agroenterprise.  Agroprocessing  workers  on  average  earn  more  than \nCNY6,000 per year. On average, real per capita income of the participating households will \nincrease by about 25%, moving poor households out of poverty and reducing their risk of sliding \nback into poverty. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is presented in Appendix 13. \n \n63.  Of the 27 project counties, cities, and districts one county\u2014Zhangjiachuan\u2014is a Hui \nautonomous county. In fact, Hui minority members make up 70% of the population. To ensure \nthat the Hui benefit from the Project, three existing enterprises were selected in the county \nunder one partnership. All three enterprises are owned by Hui and about 70% of the existing \ncontracted farmers are Hui. An additional 6,000 farm households will benefit from the expansion \nof these three enterprises. For Zhangjiachuan County, MOA and the implementing agency have \nagreed to encourage the contracting of Hui households, especially the poor and women, and \nwill monitor progress and report the results to ADB. \n \nG.  Gender and Development \n \n64.  Women in the project area undertake a greater share of farming work than men, both as \nlaborers  and  farm  owners,  as  men  have  higher  rates  (10%\u201320%)  of  seasonal  migration \ncompared to women (3%\u20139%). However, women tend to lag men in terms of (i) education;  \n(ii)  direct  access  to  farm  inputs,  new  technologies,  and  skills;  and  (iii) representation  and \ndecision-making roles in public affairs. Project activities will ensure that project benefits accrue \nequitably to men and women by (i) ensuring equitable access to technology, advice and training, \ninformation, markets, and employment in agroenterprises and farm production; (ii) ensuring \nwomen\u2019s representation in project management, advisory services, and farmers groups; and  \n(iii) strengthening collaboration between project management and relevant organizations, such \nas local branches of the All-China Women\u2019s Federation and local poverty reduction offices, and \nlearn from their experiences in the field. A gender action plan is in Appendix 14. \n \nH.  Resettlement  \n \n65.  The  Project  does  not  require  any  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement.  All \nproduction  expansion  will  be  on  existing  farm  and  agroenterprise  land.  In  addition,  ethnic \nminorities make up less than 1% of the target population and the Project will benefit them. No \nadverse effects are expected on their livelihoods or cultural heritage. \n \nI.  Risks and Mitigation Measures \n \n66.  The repayment risk will be shared by the provincial governments, participating city and \ncounty  governments,  and  enterprises.  The  local  governments  guarantee  the  repayment  of \ndisbursed loan funds. In the case of repayment default, the provincial governments agree to \ndeduct amounts due from the public budgets of the city and county governments. As a result, ", " 21\nthe local governments have a strong incentive to partner with successful private commercial \nagricultural companies to channel inputs to the farmers and link farmers\u2019 outputs to the market. \nTo mitigate the risk of crop losses due to climate change and other natural disasters, the \nprovincial governments will design and implement agricultural insurance schemes to provide \nneeded compensation to the participating farmers against crop losses due to natural disasters. \nGansu,  Henan,  and  Shandong  provinces  will  implement  the  risk  mitigation  schemes  in \naccordance with ongoing schemes in Henan province being assisted by ADB TA.20 \n \n67.  Financial  risks  associated  with  the  participating  enterprises  have  been  substantially \nmitigated  through  the  stringent  selection  of  the  participating  enterprises.  The  financial \nmanagement assessment, financial analysis and projections, and other due diligence review \ncomplement the risk mitigation efforts. Financial projections for the participating enterprises \nindicate that except for the initial 1\u20133 years when the processing capacity will not be fully \nestablished due to project construction, these participating enterprises will be able to satisfy all \nkey financial performance ratios, which are comparable with market leaders in the PRC. As one \nof the assurances, these ratios will be covenanted in the legal document. In addition, the \nparticipating enterprises will be prohibited from declaring a dividend if such payment would \ncause the covenanted ratios to fall below the specified minimum values.  \n \n68.  The  financial  management  assessment  indicates  that  the  local  governments  have \naccumulated considerable experience from ADB- and World Bank-financed projects and are \nfamiliar with ADB\u2019s requirements for the preparation and processing of withdrawal applications \nand financial management of ADB-financed projects. The financial management systems of the \nparticipating  enterprises  meet  the  requirements  for  undertaking  their  respective  activities. \nProject  implementation  will  involve  training  and  capacity  improvement  activities.  Mitigation \nmeasures are designed to strengthen financial management capacity and mitigate residual \ncontrol risks, and include (i) recruitment of well-trained project management and accounting \nstaff, (ii) preparation of a project financial management manual, (iii) well-designed and focused \ntraining by ADB\u2019s resident mission, (iv) establishment of a management information system to \nmonitor the execution of contract farming, and (v) strengthening of the control and accountability \nmechanism.  \n \n69.  The  major  impetus  for  the  adoption  of  improved  farm  technologies  and  cultivation \npractices will be the provision of incentives for farmers in the form of secure market outlets and \nprices. The same is true for the output from agroenterprise processing plants. Market analysis \nindicates that the market share obtained by Chinese exporters will continue to grow. However, a \nnumber of related factors pose a risk in this respect: (i) Chinese processed food products must \ncontinue  to  satisfy  market  preferences,  and  comply  with  national  and  international  quality \nstandards; (ii) demand may be negatively impacted if Chinese agricultural imports in major \nmarkets fail to meet international quality and safety standards; (iii) importing countries may \nimpose adverse trade measures against Chinese products; and (iv) appreciation of the yuan \nmay increase the cost of Chinese exports compared to those of competitors. The Project is \ndesigned to mitigate these risks to the extent possible by including agroenterprises that have an \nestablished record of supplying products that meet stringent international standards. In addition, \nduring implementation, agroenterprises and project agencies will promote improvement of farm \ncultivation and product quality standards including, for example, collaboration with ChinaGAP \nand other standards agencies to facilitate raw material traceability and enhance quality. \n \n \n                                                 \n20 ADB. 2007.

The  Government  will  cause  the  provincial \ngovernments  and  the  concerned  implementing  agency  to  ensure  that  such \nchange is carried out in a lawful and transparent manner. \n \n(iii)  Financial  ratios.  The  provincial  governments,  through  concerned  county \ngovernments,  will  ensure  that  each  participating  enterprise  maintains  the \nfollowing ratios: (a) debt\u2013equity ratio\u2014not more than 1.5, (b) debt service ratio\u2014\nnot less than 1.5, and (c) current ratio\u2014not less than 1.5. \n \n(iv)  Warranties and representations. The provincial governments will ensure that \neach participating enterprise will warrant and represent that (a) it is a company \nlegally incorporated under the PRC Company Law; (b) it is authorized to borrow \nfunds under the Project; (c) the financial statements within 3 months of the end of \neach  financial  year  provided  to  provincial  governments  were  prepared  in \naccordance with the accounting principles as required by the PRC Accounting \nLaw;  (d)  it  is  not  engaged  in  any  litigation,  arbitration,  or  administrative \nproceedings; and (e) it has no outstanding lien on any of its assets or the assets \nprovided as security for borrowing funds. \n \n(v)  Risk  mitigation.  The  provincial  governments  will  continue  implementing \nagricultural risk mitigation measures to assist farmers participating in the Project \nin the event of natural disasters through provision of compensation, training, and \nservices.  \n \n(vi)  Environmental and social safeguards. The provincial governments, IAs, and \nparticipating  enterprises  will  ensure  that  the  implementation  procedures \n(including prior ADB approval requirements) agreed upon with ADB are followed \nincluding environmental and social safeguard requirements in the Government's \nEIAs.  \n \n(vii)  The provincial governments, IAs, and participating enterprises will ensure that \ncivil  works  contractor  specifications  include  (a)  provisions  relating  to  the \nenvironment  including  obligating  contractors  to  carry  out  the  mitigating  and \nmonitoring  measures  specified  in  the  relevant  government  EIA,  and  (b) ", " 23\nrequirement  for  contractors  to  estimate  costs  for  all  such  mitigating  and \nmonitoring measures. \n \n(viii)  The provincial governments, IAs, and participating enterprises will ensure that \nthe activities do not result in involuntary resettlement, and any land acquisition \nthat may be required is adequately compensated in line with a resettlement plan \nprepared in accordance with applicable PRC laws and regulations, and ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995). \n \n(ix)  The provincial governments and IAs will cause the participating enterprises and \nfarmers to operate, maintain, and monitor all project facilities\u2014including water \ntreatment  plants  and  associated  pipelines,  wastewater  treatment  plants, \nwastewater collection systems, and solid waste systems\u2014in strict conformity with \n(a) all applicable laws and regulations including national and local regulations \nand  standards  for  environmental  protection,  health,  labor,  and  occupational \nsafety; (b) ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002); and (c) the environmental mitigating \nand monitoring measures detailed in the applicable government EIAs. \n \n(x)  The provincial governments will cause IAs and participating enterprises to ensure \nthat annual environmental reports are submitted to ADB, commencing from the \nstart of project implementation until 1 year after the commencement of operation \nof the project facilities. The reports will include (a) progress made on mitigating \nmeasures and monitoring; (b) problems encountered; (c) data collected; (d) a \ncorrective action plan if any violation of the initial environmental examination or \ngovernment\u2019s  environmental  laws,  regulations,  standards,  rules,  policies,  or \nguidelines  shall  have  occurred;  (e)  records  of  monitoring  and  mitigating \nmeasures;  (f)  comments  on  institutional  capacity  to  manage  the  Project\u2019s \nenvironmental activities within the provincial governments, the IAs, environmental \nprotection bureaus, and participating enterprises; and (g) recommendations to \naddress any institutional capacity challenges. \n \n(xi)  The provincial governments will cause IAs and participating enterprises to ensure \nthat written justification is provided to ADB for any proposed changes to the \nmitigation measures specified in the EIAs, which are required during the design, \nconstruction,  operation,  and  maintenance  stages  of  the  Project.  Written \njustification shall be provided within 60 days if any changes to the EIAs have to \nbe implemented for safety or emergency reasons. \n \n(xii)  The provincial governments will cause IAs and participating enterprises to ensure \nthat  project  benefits  accrue  equitably  to  men  and  women  by  (a)  ensuring \nequitable access to technology, advice and training, information, markets, and \nemployment in both agroenterprises and farm production; (b) ensuring women\u2019s \nrepresentation  in  project  management,  in  advisory  services,  and  in  farmers \ngroups;  (c)  strengthening  collaboration  between  project  management  and \nrelevant organizations; and (d) ensuring implementation of the gender action \nplan. \n \n(xiii)  The  Gansu  provincial  government  will  cause  the  Zhangjiachuan  county \ngovernment to (i) encourage the contracting of Hui households, especially the \npoor and women; and (ii) monitor the progress and report the results to ADB. \n \n ", "24  \nB.  Condition for Disbursement  \n \n71.  A condition for disbursement of the loan proceeds for the ultimate benefit of any activity \nrequires that the Government certifies, in form and substance acceptable to ADB, that (i) the \nrelevant IA and relevant participating enterprise have executed and delivered the onlending \nagreement  related  to  such  activity,  and  (ii)  such  onlending  agreement  includes  terms  and \nconditions as are required in the Loan Agreement and has become effective and binding upon \nthe parties thereto in accordance with its terms. \n \nVI.

Agriculture Sector Issues \n \n1.  Sector Policy \n \n1.  Government policy to develop the sector is described in the New Socialist Countryside \nPolicy1 and the 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010). Objectives include improving farm and off-\nfarm income opportunities, increasing grain production, developing agribusinesses and farmer \norganizations, and adopting standards and capacity to address environmental issues.2 Growth \nin  agroenterprises  provides  opportunities  for  people  to  leave  farming  and  enter  off-farm \nemployment, facilitating more sustainable farm structure and practices by reducing population \npressure  on  the  land.  Higher-quality  products  require  supply-side  strengthening,  providing \nefficiency gains and improving prices to farmers through better coordination with enterprises, \nagents, support services, and access to financial resources. \n \n2.  Agricultural Finance \n \n2.  Project area agribusinesses need financing to develop processing and increase raw \nmaterial supply. The Agricultural Development Bank of China provides agricultural enterprises \nwith overdrafts or similar short-term funds suited for seasonal working capital but not for long-\nterm working capital and fixed assets. Lending in rural areas is a low priority for banks as they \nundergo reform and serve the more readily accessible urban markets, which require a smaller \ninvestment in branches compared to the customer base. A successful approach is to provide \ncredit through district offices of the provincial financial bureaus to farmers who are linked to \nagroenterprises  or  farmer  organizations  with  marketing  contracts.3 The  county  or  district \nfinancial bureau takes responsibility for ensuring repayment of loans to selected small farmer \ngroups, which provide joint security and liability. However, use of financial bureaus is a stopgap, \nwhich does not address the fundamental market failure. \n \n3.  Agriculture and Land Degradation \n \n3.  Predominant farming systems involve wheat, corn, and livestock on very small and often \nfragmented plots, with minor higher-value crops such as vegetables and fruit. Demand for crop \nresidues for fuel and fodder means the return to the soil is not sufficient to control erosion and \nmaintain fertility. Several aspects of land degradation are highly visible and well-recognized \nsuch  as  (i)  deeply  gullied  slopes,  (ii)  river  sediment  and  dust  storms,  and  (iii)  increasing \ndesertification. Large erosion gullies not only cause problems in terms of soil loss and land \nmovement,  but  also  divide  fields  into  small  units,  difficult  to  access  by  farm  machinery. \nTraditional removal of crop residue and inappropriate cultivation reduce soil organic matter and \nincrease erosion of the most fertile surface soil. Surveys showed soil organic matter is less than \n1%, compared to the recommended 10%.4 This leads to poor fertility and soil structure, a need \nfor higher fertilizer rates, decreased water infiltration, greater water runoff and erosion, and poor \ncrop emergence thereby damaging soil and reducing water availability. A solution requires \nbuilding farmers\u2019 awareness and knowledge of sustainable agricultural practices, services for \nfertilizer  recommendations  based  on  soil  analysis,  access  to  conservation  agriculture \n                                                 \n1  Communist Party of China Central Committee. 2006.

The project area consists of poor rural townships5 of three provinces in a transitional \nzone along the Yellow River\u2014Gansu in the eroded western loess plateau, Henan in the central \nregion,  and  Shandong  in  the  northeastern  plains.  The  traditional  rain-fed  wheat  and  corn \ncropping system is dominant on both flatland and terraced hillsides; and the fragile nature of the \nsoil,6 deforestation, overgrazing, and removal of crop residues for fuel and fodder have resulted \nin the project area being some of the most degraded land in the country. Poverty in the project \narea is high (27%), 6% of residents live in absolute poverty, qualifying for minimum living \nguarantee payments from the government. Rural underemployment is high. The rural\u2013urban \nincome ratio was about 35:65 in 2006 and the gap is expected to widen. Poverty and land data \nfor the project area is show in Table A2. \n \nTable A2: Poverty and Land Data for the Project Area \nProject Area  Gansu  Henan  Shandong  Total \nPopulation  2,168,700      3,931,300   2,108,500       8,208,500     \nPopulation in poverty   432,000  1,543,600  432,900  2,408,500     \nPoverty population (%)  20.0 39.0 21.0  27.0\nProject area in absolute poverty (%)  6.1 9.0 2.5  5.9\nAverage farmer income per year (CNY)  1,664      2,805   2,271  2,247     \nArable land (hectare)  281,305  328,200  201,442  810,947 \nArable land classified as degraded (%)  60  36  25  40 \n     Source: Provincial project management offices, township statistics.  \n \nC.  Agricultural Production \n \n5.  Generally,  production  systems  are  labor-intensive  with  a  high  proportion  of  skilled \nlaborers required. Harvesting, grading, packing, and storage costs account for 65%\u201370% of all \nproduction costs. The use of other inputs varies; for example, access to irrigation depends on \nlocation,  with  supplementary  irrigation  not  available  in  some  areas.  When  combined  with \nmeasured  fertilizer  application,  supplementary  irrigation  reduces  negative  environmental \nimpacts, and can increase yields by 15%\u201320%. Water-saving flood irrigation, water-saving canal \nirrigation, and basin irrigation can save 50%\u201380% of water compared with flood irrigation, which \nis the main method used at present. Basin irrigation uses approximately one-fifth as much as \nother water-saving methods, and one sixth as much as flood irrigation.  \n \n6.  Fertilizer use is based on a variety of application methods and rates. Farmers use both \nsingle nutrient and compound fertilizers, but fertilizer application is not based on scientific soil \nand leaf analyses. Experience in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) indicates that fertilizer \napplication based on the results of soil analysis can reduce fertilizer use by up to 30%, while \nincreasing fertilizer efficacy by 5%\u201310%. The use of organic fertilizer can reduce the use of \ninorganic fertilizer by 30%\u201350%, with beneficial environmental effects. However, almost all \nfarmland within the project area is currently fertilized using chemical and compound fertilizers. \nAgroenterprises typically inspect the crops grown for quality and safety safeguards, and provide \nfree testing. \n \n                                                 \n5  Township is the administrative unit that is more representative of the project area than larger county or provincial \nboundaries. \n6  Windblown dust (loess) from ice age erosion of the Tibetan Plateau deposited a deep, weakly structured, and \nerosion-prone soil over much of the northern parts of the country. \n ", "30  Appendix 2 \n7.  In recent years, the PRC's reputation in maintaining food quality and safety standards \nhas frequently been called into question. During the first 4 months of 2007, for example, some \n300 Chinese food shipments were stopped by the United States Food and Drug Administration. \nTo  address  these  concerns,  the  PRC  initiated  ChinaGAP,  a  program  to  promote  good \nagricultural  practices.  ChinaGAP  was  launched  in  April  2006  and  will  eventually  match \nstandards laid down for certified producers supplying European markets (GLOBALGAP).7 The \nChinaGAP pilot program covers 14 provinces including Henan.  \n \nD.  Agroenterprises and Farmers \n \n1.  Contract Farming  \n \n8.  Millions of very small-scale farm households in the PRC are unable to compete\u2014to \nrespond to changes in domestic demand and withstand pressure from international markets\u2014\nwithout changing their production and trading structures. Evidence from the PRC and elsewhere \nindicates a need to strengthen processor\u2013farmer linkages through contracts, alliances, and \nother relationships.8 Contract farming offers a means to efficiently connect small-scale farmers \nand large-scale food processing firms.  \n \n9.  Contract farming in the PRC has grown rapidly over the past 10 years. Initially, contract \nfarming developed in the economically advanced coastal provinces. Now, it is spreading rapidly \ninto underdeveloped areas of the central and western PRC. The agribusiness model has proven \npotential to improve farm incomes.9 Driven by their need for quality standardized raw materials, \nand efficient and more secure supply chains, firms contract farmers to join them in production \nsystems that often involve the transfer of new technology, training and technical assistance, \ncredit for inputs, and access to new and higher-value markets. Surveys found that farmers \nidentify price stability and market access as key advantages to contracts, while firms consider \nimproved product quality the critical incentive to exercise contracts. \n \n10.  Assessment of contracts and discussion with farmers and enterprises during project \npreparation found that, in general, contract performance is dependent on the contract being \nclear enough to ensure mutual understanding by each party of contract specifications. In the \nproject  area,  the  district  department  of  commerce  provides  protection  for  both  parties \nimplementing a contract on three levels (i) firms must submit contract forms for assessment and \npreapproval prior to signing by farmers; (ii) copies of preapproved contracts signed by farmers \nand enterprises are lodged with the department, which confirms any individual variations to the \npreapproved form; and (iii) any dispute is arbitrated by the department. \n \n11.  A recent survey of more than 1,000 farmers found only 20% had written contracts with \nagroenterprises, but that 76% of farmers would like to be involved in contract farming if they \nwere offered the opportunity (footnote 9). Of those farmers with contracts, most (60%) had \nnever had a conflict with the other party in their contract; 35% had infrequent conflict about price \nand quality, which was resolved by negotiation between farmer and processor; and only 2% \nwere resolved in court. Contracts were written or verbal. Verbal contracts are used primarily by \nagents and written contracts are used by firms. Verbal contracts tend to be in mature industries, \nsuch as beef, where price determinants are commonly understood and a historical relationship \n                                                 \n7  Due to its expanding international role in establishing good agricultural practices, EurepGAP announced the change \nin its title and logo to GLOBALGAP in September 2007. \n8  Da Silva, Carlos. 2005.

Firms prefer written contracts that clearly specify rights \nand responsibilities for both parties and are common in new industries such as for processing \ncrops  where  quality  specifications  and  standardized  practices  are  required  for  processing \nsystems and standards certification. Project support to agroenterprises will provide smallholder \nfarmers the contract opportunities they want and need to continue their livelihoods.  \n \n2.  The Dragon-Head Model \n \n12.  Since  the  1990s,  the  Government  developed  a  particular  variant  of  the  vertically \nintegrated contract farming model, which is generally referred to as \u201cdragon head.\u201d In this \nmodel,  the  largest  and  strongest  agribusiness  enterprises  are  given  support  to  accelerate \ndevelopment of sustainable commercial partnerships between the enterprise and farmers. ADB \nhas supported this model in a series of projects since 199510 and it is now a well-established \nand demonstrated variant of the vertically integrated contract farming model. This state and \nprovincial status entitles the firm to reduced taxes and other benefits. In exchange for their role \nin rural development, the dragon-head firms receive support from all levels of government and, \nsince 2002, financing from the Agricultural Development Bank of China. Criteria for the award \ninclude  economic  strength,  operating  scale,  technology  and  management,  and potential to \nimprove farm incomes (footnote 9). Smaller enterprises can avail of local privileges but do not \nhave access to development funds. \n \n13.  At present, eight agroenterprises in the project area are designated as dragon-head \nsize,  although  most  conform  to  the  vertically  integrated  model  including  a  few  hundred \nagroenterprises certified to specific standards. The benefits of the contract farming model\u2014\nminimizing transaction costs in light of uncertainty, asset specificity, and market failures in \nchanging  food  systems\u2014is  the  commercial  rationale  for  farmers  and  agroenterprises  to \nstrengthen their vertical integration. Evidence of socioeconomic benefits from the PRC and \nelsewhere provides a strong development rationale strengthening processor\u2013farmer linkages \nthrough contracts and other forms of vertical integration (footnotes 8 and 9). \n \n14.  Only three enterprises (9%) meet the national requirements for their region (mostly in \nHenan,  which  targeted  larger  enterprises)  and  only  four  enterprises  (14%)  can  meet  the \nprovincial criteria (mostly in Gansu province, which has the lowest size criteria). An additional \nprovince (5%) could meet the local municipal criteria.11 Return on assets would exclude a few. \nEach enterprise meets the project financial criteria 12 but government dragon-head criteria are \neven stricter. Overall, 77% of sponsors do not meet national or provincial dragon-head criteria, \nand 71% are unable to meet even the municipal criteria in terms of size. Despite their inability to \nmeet the requirements, the agroenterprises provide contract support and market access to \nabout 850,000 farm households and more than 2 million family members.  \n                                                 \n10 The dragon-head concept was significantly developed in ADB. 1995.

Selection Criteria \n \n1.  All proposed project activities were reviewed in the context of the selection criteria. A key \naspect of the Project is to extend the demonstrated success of the vertically integrated model to \npoorer rural areas. This requires partnerships with smaller enterprises. To counter the risks this \ninvolves particular emphasis is placed on due diligence of the sponsor and the criteria applied \nare significantly stricter than in conventional Asian Development Bank (ADB)-supported projects \ndealing with large enterprises. During project preparation, the participating provinces proposed \nabout 150 potential partnerships between agroenterprises and farmers. Selections from these \nlists were made in partnership with provinces and other stakeholders by applying the following \ncriteria.  \n \n2.  Financial and Economic Criteria. The following criteria apply: \n \n(i)  The partnerships are financially sound and cost-effective as determined by a \nfinancial and economic analysis with \n(a)  a  minimum  financial  internal  rate  of  return  higher  than  the  weighted \naverage cost of capital, and \n(b)  a minimum economic internal rate of return of 12%. \n  (ii)  The agroenterprise has shown audited accounts for 3 years showing \n(a)  net profits in each year, \n(b)  debt\u2013equity ratios in each year not exceeding 1.5,1 \n(c)  debt service cover of not less than 1.5,  \n(d)  current ratios in each year not less than 1.5, and \n(e)  quick ratios of not less than 0.8. \n(iii)  Projected  financial  statements  show  viable  operation  for  not  less  than  the \nproposed loan period with financial ratios of \n(a)  debt\u2013equity ratios in each year not exceeding 1.5, \n(b)  current ratios in each year after commencement of production not less \nthan 1.5, \n(c)  quick ratio of not less than 0.8, and \n(d)  debt service cover not less than 1.5 in any year during the loan period. \n(iv)  Most labor employed by the agroenterprise is local. \n(v)  An  assured  supply  of  raw  materials  is  within  a  reasonable  distance  of  the \nprocessing facility. \n(vi)  The agroenterprise promotes economic growth in poor areas and gives priority to \npoor farmers to produce agricultural outputs needed by the processing facilities.  \n \n3.  Social Criteria. These include the following: \n \n(i)  The partnership supports poverty reduction efforts of the national and provincial \ngovernments.  \n(ii)  Water and land rights are owned or leased and operated by the participating \nbeneficiaries for project-supported activities.  \n                                                 \n1  Debt\u2013equity ratio is defined as total liabilities divided by equity. Debt service coverage ratio is net operating income \ndivided by annual debt service. Current ratio is current assets divided by current liabilities. Quick ratio is current \nassets less inventory divided by current liabilities. \n ", "36  Appendix 5   \n(iii)  Low-income  households  are  identified  and  selected  as  much  as  possible  in \npartnership  with  the  county  project  management  office,  sponsoring \nagroenterprise, farmers association, local village leaders, rural poverty reduction \noffices, and other community-based organizations. \n(iv)  Women are given preference in participation and employment opportunities.  \n \n4.  Environmental Criteria. The criteria include the following: \n \n(i)  The proposed activities are assessed pursuant to the laws and regulations of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), the Environment Policy (2002) of the ADB, \nand the initial environmental examination to be approved by the appropriate \ngovernment authorities and ADB. \n(ii)  Activities do not entail new clearing of forestland or seek to replace any natural \necosystem with designed agricultural systems and rural infrastructure. \n(iii)  No development, including operation of new processing lines, will have a water \ndemand  that  jeopardizes  ongoing  use  at  existing  volumes  of  existing  users \nincluding downstream and shared reservoir users. \n(iv)  An  environmental  impact  assessment  report  prepared  for  each  activity  and \nsubmitted  to  an  authorized  environmental  protection  agency  for  review  and \napproval, includes an environmental management plan with mitigation measures \nand financial sources as a prerequisite for approval of funding. A monitoring and \nenforcement  program  ensures  that  project  activities  have  no  major  adverse \nenvironmental impacts. \n(v)  Public consultation is part of the environmental assessment for each activity \nbased on public involvement procedures and guidelines of the PRC and ADB's \nEnvironment Policy. \n \nB.  Due Diligence Analysis \n \n5.  The financial criteria were applied to the last 3 years of audited accounts of each \nagroenterprise to confirm profitability and soundness of financing (Table A5). In some cases, \nagroenterprises did not fully meet all the financial criteria and were subjected to a more detailed \nreview. In some cases, a specific ratio can be misleading. For example, substantial repayment \nof short-term debt may produce an apparently \u201cpoor\u201d debt service ratio or the indicated problem \ncould already be corrected. Also, poor quick ratios may be corrected by refinancing short-term \ndebt with longer-term debt and equity. Where these exceptions are selected to participate in the \nProject, the reasons are clearly stated in the financial statements (Supplementary Appendix C). \nThe financial management capacity of every enterprise was reviewed in the context of the \ncomprehensive financial management assessment (Supplementary Appendix C). \n \n6.  Table A5 presents the worst performance scenario of each enterprise against each \nfinancial criterion for the project period and subsequent 20 years of operation. Parallel outputs \nof the model provide the basis for cost estimates and financial plans in Appendix 7, and the \nfinancial and economic analyses in Appendix 12.

The  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  has  made  several  regional  and  national \nassessments of the cost and other impacts of land degradation. In 1999, total direct costs were \nestimated at $7.7 billion about 4% of the gross domestic product, while indirect costs were \n$31 billion.1 Regional impacts were greatest in the western region, and assessments show that \nwhile the return to farmer investment in soil conservation in the Yangtse valley is high, this is not \nso in the project area (Yellow River and the loess region) and external assistance is needed. \nPoverty and land degradation are closely correlated. The root causes relate to decreasing land \nper  capita,  poverty  in  fragile  environments,  top\u2013down  application  of  policies  without  local \nparticipation, and sector-driven management initiatives. In farm communities in the project area, \ncauses include improper farming practices on steep slopes, overgrazing, neglect of community \nconservation practices under the new rural system, and use of biomass for household energy. \n \n2.  No simple solution is available. The management of dryland project areas must be \ncoordinated by the farmers and other stakeholders in a way that makes clear sense to them. \nPromoting farmers\u2019 understanding and technical ability to cope with the linkages between land \nuse, soil fertility, and water is critical. A large body of evidence shows that any activity must \ninvolve a bottom\u2013up, participative approach for problem identification, selection of appropriate \ntechnologies, and planning and implementation of solutions.2 The key to sustainable farming in \nproject areas is to manage land, water, technical, physical, and financial resources in concert. \nImplementing this requires institutional support. \n \n3.  Farmers often view water as the most valuable resource. Erratic precipitation means \nfarmers cannot depend solely on rainfall. Surface water is intermittent rather than consisting of \nperennial streams, and sparse vegetative cover means water may be lost in flashfloods when it \nrains. Surface erosion reduces farm productivity; but worse, deep gullies destroy or isolate fields \nfrom draft animals and machinery. Gully erosion indicates advanced land degradation. Loss of \nfertility is less visible yet almost as severe in impact. However, sustainable farming is possible \nusing a range of techniques including \n \n(i)  conservation agriculture including cultivation technology that incorporates crop \nresidues back into the soil and restores soil organic matter, which reduces runoff, \nimproves  the  soil\u2019s  capacity  to  hold water and nutrients, and improves crop \nemergence; \n(ii)  vegetation  management  and  intercropping  that  can  conserve  existing  water \nsupplies and increase the yield of water for storage;  \n(iii)  efficient irrigation, mulching, and selection of crops and varieties with inherently \nlow consumptive use that can extend existing water supplies; \n(iv)  diversification  from  low-value  and  high-risk  crops  to  alternatives  providing \nopportunities for substantial change to more sustainable farming; \n(v)  water harvesting systems that are best suited for livestock, greenhouses, and \nsmall-scale farming, consisting of roofs, rock outcrops, paved roads, storage \ntanks, lined wells, underground tanks, and small dams; \n(vi)  lateral diversion and terracing that slow rainfall runoff and allow for diversion \nwatercourses; small earth dams may be constructed across gullies or streams to \nstore water; \n                                                 \n1  L.

Scope of Services \n \n4.  The Spanish Cooperation Fund for Technical Assistance grant for $350,000 will be \nimplemented in association with the Project. The objective of the grant is to improve sustainable \nfarming practices that address land degradation and water conservation. The grant may also \nprovide  support  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  implementing  agencies  and  the  project \nperformance management system required for successful implementation of the Project. The \ngrant will be implemented in parallel with the Project\u2019s activities involving agroenterprises to \nstrengthen opportunities for contracted farmers to adopt new sustainable farming practices and \ntechnologies.  Under  the  Project,  agroenterprises  will  contract  additional  farmers  to  supply \nalternative  and/or  incremental  farm  production.  By  promoting  the  adoption  of  sustainable \nfarming practices, the grant will enhance environmental outcomes, strengthen long-term rural \npoverty reduction, and reduce supply-chain risks for enterprises. \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n5.  Implementation methods will draw on proven participatory and holistic approaches such \nas participatory watershed management and farmer field schools, and build on the interests of \nagroprocessors through their contract farming and other vertical relationships. The grant will \nprovide about 40\u201350 sessions of 3- to 5-day training courses to (i) raise farmers\u2019 and agriculture \ntechnicians\u2019 awareness and priorities for soil and water issues; (ii) explain technologies and \nsustainable land and farming practices using specialist resource persons; and (iii) facilitate \nfarmers, agroenterprises, and local authorities to develop and implement action plans. The \nsubjects covered will include (i) conservation agriculture including minimum soil tillage, crop \nrotation, permanent soil coverage, and specialized farm machinery; (ii) reduced soil erosion \nusing  various  techniques;  (iii)  improved  use  of  organic  fertilizer  and  integrated  pest \nmanagement; and (iv) water harvesting techniques. The grant may also be used to assess the \nimpact of climate change on land degradation. The costs of implementing action plans will be \nborne by farmers (including in kind as labor), agroenterprises (such as new varieties and \nmachinery services), and local authorities (including technical support services, government \nprograms, and subsidies for biogas digesters). The grant will provide specialist expertise for \n                                                 \n3  Zhong Li, Yin D., Zhang Y., Zhu H, Yang G., T. Rego and S.P.

Several PRC institutions \nand agencies have relevant technical expertise and experience to support the grant. 4 \n \n6.  The grant will support on-farm activities associated with the agroenterprises in Gansu, \nHenan, and Shandong provinces. The large area and number of farmers mean the grant will be \nspread  thinly  and  therefore,  must  be  carefully  focused  and  coordinated  to  maximize \ncollaborative  application  of  government,  agroenterprise,  and  farmer  resources.  Farmers \norganized in groups will be represented by leaders and other representatives. In line with the \nemphasis on the western region, Gansu province will be given priority in training courses. \nImplementation must be coordinated closely with implementation of agroenterprise activities and \nfund allocation will be based on the number of farmer production bases being supported by the \nProject. Thus, market structures and other off-farm activities are excluded from support. \n \n7.  The cofinancing grant from the Spanish Cooperation Fund for Technical Assistance will \ncover the costs of consultants comprising about 5 person-months of international and about \n25 person-months of national experts to be recruited through a firm using the quality- and cost-\nbased selection method (80:20). This will cover (i) the preparation and delivery of training (about \n50 short courses) to farmers and agriculture technicians in the project area on participatory soil \nand water management, and sustainable agriculture; (ii) support to local institutions in Gansu, \nHenan,  and  Shandong  provinces  to  facilitate  the  adoption  of  sustainable  agriculture  in \ncollaboration with the training course delivery; and (iii) training materials. The national and \nprovincial governments will provide office and training facilities, domestic travel, counterpart \nagency  support  service  staff,  and  materials  and  equipment  to  demonstrate  sustainable \nagricultural technology. The provincial governments, agroenterprises, and farmer communities \nwill cover the costs of implementing sustainable agriculture action plans produced from the \ntraining. All recruitment will follow the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n                                                 \n4  For example, the Gansu Grassland Ecological Research Center. \n ", "     \nDETAILED INVESTMENT AND FINANCING PLANS\nTable A7.1:  Detailed Cost Estimates by Project Component and Province\n($ million)\nGansu Henan Shandong National Total\nItem Amount % Amount % Amount % Amount % Amount\nA.

The financial and economic analyses of 29 farm and agroenterprise partnerships located \nin three provinces\u2014Gansu, Henan, and Shandong\u2014were carried out separately for (i) improved \nfarming production (also referred to as farm production base), (ii) agroenterprise processing, \nand (iii) combined partnerships. The analysis for the farms assesses the financial viability of the \nproposed  crop  diversification,  improved  environment-friendly  production  technologies,  and \nqualitative improvements of output. The economic payoff to the overall Project is estimated for \nthe  partnerships,  which  includes  incremental  costs  needed  to  provide  project  support  and \nmanagement. \n \n2.  For the farming operations, the main direct benefits are from incremental production \nrealized from (i) improved yields; (ii) changes in the cropping pattern and crop diversification, \nwith introduction of high-value crops and fruit trees; and (iii) quality of outputs that receive \nhigher contracted prices. This will be achieved through intensive technical support from the \ncounty  agriculture  extension  services,  growers  association,  and  principally  from  technical \nsupport from the contracting agroenterprise. The agroenterprises will assist the growers in \nprocuring quality and improved inputs; and in investing in farm tools and machinery, irrigation-\nrelated equipment and civil works, and other farm structures and civil works. These include \nstores, poles, and wires for vineyards; iron structures; and plastic sheets for greenhouse or \ntunnel farming. Crop budgets for benefiting farms will increase incomes significantly from crop \ndiversification (Supplementary Appendix D). \n \n3.  The supported agroenterprises were analyzed with respect to financial and economic \nviability. The financial and economic returns for each agroenterprise are shown in Appendix 5. \nThe agroenterprises will benefit from expansion in their production capacity, reduction in output \nwastage and postharvest losses, and value addition through improved quality production for \ndomestic and international markets. Generally, the expansion of processing units will take 2\u20133 \nyears. The gestation period for reaching full development for the agroenterprises varies from 3 \nto 5 years. Hence, farm and enterprise production is assumed to attain full development during \nproject implementation. However, fruit crops would reach full development stage in 7\u201310 years. \nThis is accounted for in projecting the incremental cost and benefit streams. \n \n4.  In addition to the direct benefits, the Project will generate various positive externalities \nand nonquantifiable benefits. The main benefits include environmental improvement, as a result \nof arresting land degradation and loss of topsoil from erosion; utilization and conservation of \nscarce  water  resources;  proper  disposal  of  agroenterprise  waste;  and  judicious  use  of \nagrochemicals. The expansion in farm productivity and introduction of high-value crops, fruit \ntrees, and livestock will generate significant on-farm and off-farm employment in processing and \nmarketing. The realization of higher incomes by participating farmers will encourage and induce \nnonparticipating farmers to adopt better production practices. This will help stabilize prices and \ncompetition in the market; generate employment for the service sector; and increase household \nincomes, living standards, and rural quality of life. The financial and economic analyses were \nconducted in accordance with the Financial Analysis and Management of Projects (2005) and \nGuidelines for Economic Analysis of Projects (1997) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n ", "52  Appendix 12 \nA.  Assumptions \n \n5.  The  financial  and  economic  analyses  are  based  on  the  following  assumptions \n(i) constant 2008 prices and constant exchange rate of $1 = CNY7.74, the rate prevailing at the \ntime of data collection; (ii) 25-year period of analysis; (iii) estimated investment costs for the \nproduction  bases  and  agroenterprises  based  on  market  prices  delivered  at  the  site  plus \nprovision  of  contingencies;  (iv)  3-year  construction  period  with  productive  capacity  being \ngradually built up within each partnership; (v) productive life of equipment is 10 years and \nreplacement costs are reflected in the cost streams, while salvage values are included in benefit \nstreams; (vi) for the economic analysis, valuation of economic costs and benefits uses the \ndomestic price numeraire; (vii) financial costs of traded goods are adjusted to their respective \neconomic values using a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.01; the shadow wage rate for \nunskilled labor is estimated at 0.80 of the prevailing wage rate; and the conversion factors for \nskilled labor, other costs, and benefits are estimated to be 1.0; (viii) financial investment costs, \nincluding physical contingencies, are converted to economic values by deducting taxes and \nduties and applying relevant conversion factors to the investment components, including foreign \ncosts, unskilled and skilled labor, and other costs (the resulting values represent the economic \ninvestment costs of the Project according to the domestic price numeraire); and (ix) all other \nlocal currency economic costs are assumed to equal their financial costs after deducting taxes \nand duties. \n \nB.  Demand Analysis \n \n6.  The Project will support (i) production of processed and unprocessed farm produce;  \n(ii)  supply  of  farm  inputs  including  seeds,  organic  fertilizers,  packing  material,  and  farm \nmachinery;  and  (iii)  additional  marketing-related  infrastructure  such  as  marketplaces  and \nstorage capacity. The major agricultural production activities in the project area include wheat, \ncorn, cornstarch, cotton, vegetables, grapes, other fruits, sweet potatoes, mushrooms, herbs, \nsoybeans, peanuts, animal feed, pork, beef, milk, wool, eggs, and honey. Project beneficiaries \nwill produce an additional 100,000 tons (t) of wheat, about 80,000 t of wheat products, 10,000 t \nof corn, 30,000 t of cornstarch, 30,000 t of cotton seed and associated products (oil cake and \noil), 80,000 t of vegetables, 18,000 t of organic vegetables, and 11,000 t of grapes for wine and \njuices. Qualitative improvements will be realized for 80,000 t of fruits, 17,000 t of Chinese dates, \n30,000 t of sweet potatoes, 18,000 t of pepper and garlic, 2,500 t of mushrooms, 540 t of ginko, \n700 t of high-value herbs, 5,000 t each of concentrated soybean proteins and peanut products, \nand 1,000 t of quality vegetable seed. The Project will also support additional production of \n24,000 t of pork, 12,000 t of piglets, 3,000 t of processed beef, 6,000 t of milk, 3,000 t of wool, \n3,000 t of eggs, 2,000 t of honey, and 100,000 t of animal feed. To facilitate production and \nmarketing of farm produce, the Project will support the construction of markets (25,000 square \nmeters); construction of storage facilities for about 3,700 t of perishable and semiperishable \ncommodities  and  packing  materials  (100,000  boxes);  and  production  of  \n120,000 t of organic fertilizers, farm machines, and tools. \n \n7.  Information on supply, demand, prices, and market competition were collected for each \nof the 29 partnerships. The sector analysis is presented in Appendix 2, further analysis was \ncarried out using surveys, focus group discussions, and field visits to confirm the demand for \nproject  outputs.  Three  partnerships  were  selected  for  in-depth  analysis  based  on  their \ngeographic  location  and  product  type  including  (i)  cattle  and  sheep  production  under  the \nZhangjiangchuan  sustainable  agricultural  partnership  in  Gansu  province,  (ii)  sweet  corn \nproduction under the Anyang\u2013Yuehe sweet corn partnership in Henan province, and (iii) peanut \nprocessing under the Linshu\u2013Changlin peanut partnership in Shangdong province.  \n ", "  Appendix 12  53 \n \n8.  The analysis shows that unmet demand for production is significant because of rising \nincomes in the country; change of food consumption patterns, particularly for livestock and dairy \nproducts; and growing export demand. At present the agroprocessing enterprises\u2019 production \ncapacities  are  constrained  to  meet  growing  demand  in  the  markets.  Given  the  sustained \ncompetitive  and  comparative  advantage,  opportunities  for  expansion  are  significant.  The \nincremental production under the Project for each partnership is small so that no significant \nimpact is expected on either domestic or international prices. Furthermore, the Project will \nsupport the adoption of improved farm production technologies, shift to higher-value crops, \nexpansion in value-addition infrastructure, improvement in the quality of outputs, and reduction \nin postharvest losses (storage facilities and marketing infrastructure) that will strengthen the \ncompetitiveness of the farmers and agro-enterprises in the markets. \n \nC.  Financial Analysis \n \n9.  Crop budgets were estimated for both with- and without-project situations for traditional \ncrops. The introduced higher-value crops will result in significantly higher gross margins. In \nGansu province, the entire area under wheat will likely be replaced with higher-value crops. Also \nin Henan province, almost the entire area under traditionally grown crops\u2014wheat and corn\u2014will \nbe substituted by high-value crops. In Shandong province, the Project will result in higher crop \nintensities of existing crops. Higher incomes are expected to be realized from better crop \nhusbandry and adoption of technology packages. \n \n10.  The investments of participating enterprises under the Project include establishment, \nmodernization, and refurbishment of processing lines; and technical support and services to \ncontracted farmers for the supply of improved quality raw materials. The adoption of farming \nimprovements and associated investment by farmers is contingent on access to improved inputs, \ntechnical  and  financial  support,  and  assured  fair  prices.  The  Project  will  provide  these  to \ncontracted farmers under the partnership arrangements through the existing extension services \nand participating enterprises. The contracted farmers will be paid predetermined fair prices for \nthe  output.  Following  this  partnership  approach,  the  value  added  by  the  Project  will  be \nreasonably  shared  by  farmers  and  the  enterprises.  Integration  of  farmers\u2019  inputs  with  the \nsupport services and other investment of enterprises is important to increase benefits to farmers. \nConsidering this feature of the Project, each participating agroenterprise's financial internal rate \nof return (FIRR) is calculated on the basis of integrating the activities of constructing processing \nplants and associated production base, as well as provision of support services. The FIRRs of \neach partnership are shown in Table A5 in Appendix 5. \n \n11.  The FIRRs, computed on an after-tax basis, range from 15% to 22% for the partnerships \nin Henan province, 17% to 25% for the partnerships in Shandong province, and 14% to 25.5% \nfor the partnerships in Gansu province. The FIRR results compare favorably with the respective \nweighted average costs of capital, estimated in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for the \nFinancial  Analysis  and  Management  of  Projects  (2005),  using  the  relative  proportion  and \nrelative cost of each source in total agroenterprise financing. For agroenterprises, 12% equity \nfinancing is assumed, with a resulting weighted average cost of capital of 6.72%. The analysis \nsuggests that the investments are financially viable.  \n \n12.  The sensitivity analysis shows that the FIRRs are relatively robust to adverse changes in \nproject costs and delays in project implementation. However, the FIRRs show a relatively high \nsensitivity to changes in yield and output prices. Special attention will have to be given to factors \nthat may affect yields, and quality of crops and livestock in the project area such as the quality \nof infrastructure works, maintenance of facilities, and utilization of appropriate crop and livestock \n ", "54  Appendix 12 \nproduction techniques, which will be channeled through technical support and farmer training in \nthe project area.  \n \nD.  Economic Analysis \n \n13.  Analysis of the project returns based on economic costs and benefits was carried out to \nevaluate the economic viability of the overall Project. This is based on the analysis of each \npartnership. Economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) are presented in Table A12 for the \nenterprise  partnership  aggregated  for  each  province.  Based  on  this,  the  overall  economic \nviability of the Project is estimated by adding the project management costs incurred by county, \nprovincial, and national PMOs. Sensitivity analysis assesses the vulnerability of the EIRRs to \nunanticipated increases in costs and decreases in benefits. \n \n14.  The estimated EIRR for the partnerships in Gansu province is estimated at 33.7%, \nfollowed by 34.9% in Henan province, and 80.8% in Shandong province. The combined EIRR \nfor the three provinces is estimated at 37.1%. With the addition of project management costs, \nthe EIRR for the Project is estimated at 36.4%. The detailed tables and EIRR analysis are in \nSupplementary Appendix D. \n \nTable A12: Summary Economic Internal Rate of Return and Switching Values \n  Sensitivity Analysis \nBase  (Switching Values with  EIRRs Pegged at 12%) \nEIRR  % Cost  % Benefit  Simultaneous Change \nType of Operation by Province  Increase  Decrease \nGansu Province         \nFarming Operation  14.8  6.3  5.5  3.0 \nProcessing Unit  39.2  21.2  17.5  9.6 \nPartnership  33.7  20.1  16.6  9.1 \nHenan Province         \nFarming Operation  22.8  46.8  26.2  16.9 \nProcessing Unit  44.3  8.4  7.8  4.0 \nPartnership  34.9  10.0  9.0  4.7 \nShandong Province         \nFarming Operation  (0.9)a  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014 \nProcessing Unit  100.7  16.2  14  7.4 \nPartnership  80.8  19.4  16.5  8.9 \nOverall Project         \nFarming Operation  13.8  5.1  3.8  7.4 \nProcessing Unit  51.7  14.4  12.6  6.7 \nPartnership  37.1  13.7  11.9  6.4 \nWith Project Management Cost  36.4  13.4  11.6  6.2 \n( ) = negative, \u2014 = not available, EIRR = economic internal rate of return. \na  As the EIRR is less than 12%, switching values are not calculated. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n15.  The sensitivity analysis is based on switching values defined as the percentage increase \nin costs or decrease in benefits that would constrain (peg) the EIRR at 12%. This percentage \nindicates a maximum increase in cost or decrease in benefits beyond which the investment is \nnot viable at the 12% cutoff point. The switching values for the Project indicate that the overall \nProject can sustain a cost increase of about 13.4% or a maximum decrease of benefits by \n11.6%. Also, the Project will remain viable despite an increase in costs and simultaneous \ndecrease in benefits of 6.2%. The sensitivity analysis suggests that the Project is relatively \nsensitive to price changes.  \n \n16.  The  distributional  analysis  involves  the  allocation  of  net  economic  benefits  among \ndifferent groups such as agroenterprises, farmers, and local governments. The analysis shows \n ", "  Appendix 12  55 \nthat agroenterprises receive about 60% of both the financial net present value and economic \nnet present value, with farmers and local governments receiving the other 40%. This indicates a \nrelatively balanced distribution of benefits between agroenterprises and farmers.  \n ", "56   Appendix 13 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \nCountry/Project Title: People's Republic of China: Dryland Sustainable Agriculture Project \nEast Asia Department \nLending/Financing Modality:  Loan  Department/Division: \nAgriculture, Environment, and Natural Resources Division \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.    Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nThe Government\u2019s agriculture and rural policy objectives include improving farm and off-farm income opportunities through \nsupport to agribusiness, farmers, and environmental issues. The policy recognizes that increasing farm incomes and reducing \nland degradation requires sector restructuring, access to technology, and coordination. The Government\u2019s 11th Five-Year \nPlan prioritizes agriculture and sustainable rural development through the New Socialist Countryside Policy. The country \npartnership strategy (2008\u20132010) outlines the Asian Development Bank (ADB) strategy to support the Government\u2019s ongoing \npoverty reduction efforts. Nationally, poor people mostly live in the central and western provinces that lag the eastern \nprovinces in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. In these regions, poverty is mostly rural and strongly correlated to \naccess to land and incidence of land degradation. The Government sees agribusiness as a means of reducing rural poverty. \nThe  Project  comprises  an  investment package that will strengthen sustainable enterprises and farmers by improving \nprocessing and value-adding capacity, product and management system standards accreditation, access to higher-value \nmarkets,  and  access  to  finance  and  strengthened  support  services.  By  strengthening  the  vertical  linkages  between \nagroenterprises and farmers, low-income and poor-farm households will access higher-value markets and off-farm income, \nreduce marketing costs, and reduce vulnerability through contract farming arrangements. Contracts and alliances between \nfarmers and agroenterprises include provision of farmer training in sustainable technologies to produce and deliver high-\nquality, high-value produce. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nPoverty in the project area remains significant by world benchmarks. Based on the provincial poverty classification of CNY825 \n($115) per person per year, about 27% of project area residents are poor; 6% are in living severe poverty and receive \nminimum living guarantee payments from government, compared to 2.5% nationally. A social and poverty assessment was \ncarried out for the project area in compliance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Incorporation of Social Dimensions in Bank Operations \n(1993). Poverty analysis was undertaken using a field survey of 180 rural households and within 12 representative rural \ncommunities covering the three project provinces. Institutional consultation was undertaken regarding ongoing programs and \nexperiences with rural development and poverty reduction. The assessment confirmed disparate growth rates between \nsectors resulting in large income inequities between rural and urban households and between groups of rural dwellers. The \nassessment concludes that rural poverty is worst in areas with hilly land, marginal soils, and difficult access to markets and \nsupport services. Poverty is linked closely to limited land per capita, declining productivity, low education, increased migration \nfor work, households headed by women, increased dependence on straw and crop residues for heating, and limited off-farm \nwork. Average rural incomes are 30% of urban incomes, creating incentives for urbanization for those who are able to move. \nMost poor farmers have no other choice of income. The underlying causes for rural poverty include (i) high population and \nsmall landholdings; (ii) disasters, degraded land, and unsustainable farming practices; (iii) reliance on farm income and limited \noff-farm job opportunities; (iv) increasing costs for inputs to maintain yields (fertilizer, machinery, and irrigation); (v) lack of \naccess to improved technology, working capital, and higher-value products and markets; and (vi) limited agriculture sector \nintegration. The analysis concludes that poverty is linked strongly to insufficient land per capita and other assets including \nworking capital and technology, which prevent poor rural households from building capacity to exit poverty. These underlying \ncauses of rural poverty support the need for a strategy that includes facilitating rural labor to move into off-farm employment. \n \n2. Design Features \nA key design feature builds on the findings of a recent ADB evaluation of poverty exit achievements, which highlights the \nsuccess of linking the rural poor to commercial value-adding enterprises and associated off-farm employment opportunities. \nThe Project applies this by supporting enterprises located in the project areas and applying poverty-targeting criteria for \nsupport. \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending \u2014 Not applicable \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \nThe project area has about 2.8 million farm households. Of these, 1.3 million (48%) farm households are in Henan province, \nfollowed by 721,000 (26%) in Gansu province, and 719,000 (26%) in Shandong province. The average household farm area is \nabout 0.28 hectares (ha), ranging from 0.25 ha in Henan, to 0.28 ha in Shandong, and to 0.39 ha in Gansu. Of these, only \nabout 600,000 farm households will participate in the Project. Agriculture in the project area is almost entirely based on \nsmallholder farming. Most farmers growing cereal and horticulture crops still use traditional farming practices. They have \nlimited access to markets or the technology required to introduce more economically and environmentally sustainable \n \n ", "  Appendix 13  57 \npractices and diversify into higher-value crops. As a result, farm productivity and incomes are low. The persistence of \ntraditional farming practices presents a major threat to the project area's natural resource base through water use, soil \nerosion, and overuse of fertilizer and agrochemicals. Environmental concerns are exacerbated by the dependence of rural \ncommunities on wood and coal for household fuel and negatively impacts on household living conditions and health.  \n \nFarmers (especially women) and small businesses are disadvantaged in terms of access to formal credit. Most farm \nexpenditures are financed by farmers' savings, and most loans are obtained from informal sources (e.g., relatives, friends, \nmoneylenders, and pawnbrokers). The small size and short term of most agricultural finance preclude investment in assets \nthat have a long payback period. The failure of the financial sector to function effectively in support of agricultural and \nagribusiness development means that market opportunities\u2014and the associated introduction of more economically and \nenvironmentally sustainable agricultural production\u2014 are not being realized. \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nThe project design process used local experts to carry out multistakeholder, multisector analysis. Project consultation with \nstakeholders,  beneficiaries,  and  directly  affected  people  was  undertaken  during  project  design.  A  participatory  and \nconsultative methodology was adopted to undertake the social analysis and rural livelihood survey during the project \npreparatory technical assistance. It involved (i) a formal questionnaire survey of 180 households, (ii) discussions with project \nstakeholders, (iii) key informant interviews in rural communities, (iv) a series of stakeholder workshops with the provinces and \nthe Ministry of Agriculture, (v) interviews with key government staff and nongovernment organizations, (vi) interviews with \nethnic minorities, and (vii) interviews with women. Detailed discussions were maintained using both sector and cross-sector \nworking groups that included the provincial project management offices (PMOs) and their expert groups, project implementing \nagencies  and  associated  state-owned  enterprises,  design  institutes,  academics,  and  safeguard  agencies  including \nenvironment and poverty reduction officials under the leadership of the PMOs. The work of the working groups was \ncollectively discussed and reviewed through a series of stakeholder workshops. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during project implementation and monitoring? \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \nDuring project implementation, the participation of stakeholders including beneficiaries will continue to be built through \nparticipatory planning and implementation processes. Equitable participation of women and the poor in decision-making and \nplanning of agribusiness activities will be important to ensure successful project outcomes. For example, agroenterprises will \nstrengthen farmer groups and negotiate contractual arrangements with organizations, farmer agents, and individuals. The \nPMOs will be responsible for ensuring enterprises target poor rural areas and prioritize employment of local people and \nwomen. The use of demonstrations linked to farmer associations, contract farming systems, and outreach programs will adopt \na highly participatory approach to rural livelihood improvement. \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No    (If a C&P plan was not prepared, explain why). \nNo specific C&P plan was prepared but consultation and participation activities have been and will be the cornerstone for the \nproject design, preparation, and implementation. Social development specialists in the provincial PMOs have been and will \ncontinue to be involved in the process to ensure that thorough consultation and participation of stakeholders take place with \nawareness-raising activities for multiple stakeholders including local governments, agroenterprises, and farmer beneficiaries. \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues \nGender roles are determined by a combination of cultural factors, occupations, environmental conditions, education, and \nemployment opportunities. In the project area, income inequalities create incentives for rural males to migrate periodically to \nurban labor markets resulting in a degree of feminization of agriculture. Female participation in training, employment, and \ncontract farming opportunities will be implemented, and agroenterprises will favor women for incremental employment in \nproject-supported expansion of agroprocessing capacity. In addition, the Project is promoting on-farm opportunities preferred \nby women, with lighter manual labor and/or based at the household such as rabbit farming, walnut growing and preprocessing, \nand farm mechanization tailored to women\u2019s needs. \n \n2.  Key Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and \nuse of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process \n  Gender plan          Other actions/measures         No action/measure \n \nTo promote project effectiveness, a gender action plan was prepared to (i) ensure equitable participation of women in \nagribusiness development; (ii) ensure equitable access to employment and training, technology, information, and markets; (iii) \nensure women\u2019s representation in project management; and (iv) strengthen coordination between project management and \nrelevant organizations such as agroenterprises and farmer associations. Gender-sensitive indicators are included in the \nproject performance management system especially for key areas such as employment and income generation, access to \nagricultural inputs, technology, information and marketing, and women\u2019s representation in decision-making processes and \nstructures. \n ", "58  Appendix 13 \nIII.

The social survey indicates that women in the project area potentially have a higher \nshare of farming work than men, both as laborers and managers. As a result of this feminization \nof farming, women gain status and opportunity by making more management decisions and \nhandling household finances, but they may also have a greater burden of heavy work. They \nmay have less access to new farming technologies and training, and less representation and \ndecision-making in public affairs as they tend to have less education.  \n \n2.  The  survey  found  that  women  want  to  reduce  the  burden  of  cultivation  and \nmechanization by adopting conservation agriculture and installing biogas digesters. The Project \nsupports biogas and mechanization through service providers and also the Henan Haofeng \nagromachinery  company,  which  manufactures  a  range  of  lighter  equipment  tailored  to  the \nstrength and weight of women. The survey found that more than 40% of employees working in \nagroprocessing are female, and agroprocessors stated they prefer women since they tend to \nmaintain  product  quality  standards  better  than  men.  Project-supported  agroprocessing \nenterprises will increase employment for women. Training in new crops, technologies, and \npractices  given  by  agroenterprises  to  contracted  farmers  will  target  women,  especially  in \nprocessing crops where the firm needs to ensure standardized high-quality production. Table \nA14 provides a summary of proposed activities and targets for the Project. \n \nTable A14: Gender Equality Activities and Targets \nObjective  Activities and Targets \n1.
