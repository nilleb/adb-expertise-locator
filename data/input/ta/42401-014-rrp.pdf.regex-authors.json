I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  to  Azerishiq  Open  Joint-Stock  Company  (OJSC), \nguaranteed by the Republic of Azerbaijan, for the Power Distribution Enhancement Investment \nProgram.1 \n \n2.  The investment program aims to support the government\u2019s efforts in providing reliable \nand  efficient  power  supply  to  meet  its  growing  energy  needs  for  inclusive  development, \nespecially in secondary cities and rural areas. Through rehabilitation and augmentation of the \npower distribution network throughout the country, the investment program will improve power \nsupply  reliability  and  efficiency,  and  support  the  improvement  of  operational  and  financial \nperformance of the state-owned power distribution company.2   \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Sector overview. The energy sector plays a leading role in Azerbaijan\u2019s socioeconomic \ngrowth. The total electricity production in 2014 reached 22.7 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh), of \nwhich 94% was generated from thermal power and 6% from hydropower. The current total \ninstalled generation capacity is 6.2 gigawatts (GW) including gas-fired thermal power plant \ncapacity of 5.1 GW (82.3%) and hydropower plant capacity of 1.1 GW (17.7%). In 2014, the \navailable total generation capacity was 5.9 GW while the peak demand was 4.1 GW. At present, \nelectricity production is sufficient to cover domestic demand, with the surplus being exported to \nneighboring countries, taking advantage of regional synergies.3 Though the economic growth is \ncurrently experiencing slowdown, the recovery is projected to strengthen in 2018 and beyond. \nDomestic electricity sales are expected to grow due to economy recovery and improved power \nsupply reliability.  \n \n4.  The key challenges facing the energy sector are (i) improving operational and financial \nefficiency, (ii) restoring and maintaining high levels of services throughout the country, and (iii) \nestablishing a sustainable cost-recovery financing mechanism. Despite significant investments \nmade  in  generation  and  transmission  facilities  since  2005,  supply  of  reliable  electricity  to \ncustomers is limited as a result of bottlenecks in the distribution network, where relatively little \ninvestment  has  been  made  because  of  budget  constraints.4 In  2014,  the  technical  and \ncommercial distribution losses were 18.8%5 and revenue collection was 70.0%.6 Although there \nis almost 100% access to energy, the existing distribution networks outside of Baku and its \nsuburban areas, particularly in secondary cities and rural areas, are in poor condition and \ncannot provide reliable, high-quality services to customers, which affects the living conditions of \nhouseholds  and  discourages  new  economic  activities.  The  majority  of  power  distribution \nfacilities have been in operation for 30 years or more. The equipment has reached the end of its \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2015. Technical Assistance to Azerbaijan for Preparing the MFF Power Distribution Enhancement Investment \nProgram. Manila. \n3   In 2014, power export accounted for 2% of the total production.  \n4   Currently, all investment in distribution networks relies on the state budget with no private sector investments \nparticipated in the distribution subsector due to slow progress on sector reform. \n5   Refers to the aggregate level for the distribution network outside of Baku and its suburban area, including technical \nloss of 11.13% and commercial loss of 7.73%. In Baku and its suburban area, the technical loss is 8.97% and \ncommercial loss is 0.74%. Commercial losses include electricity theft and inaccurate metering.  \n6  The revenue not collected amounts to about $200 million. ", "2 \nservice life and has become undependable, with more frequent outages and increasing losses. \nThe  unreliable  power  supply  and  inefficient  utilization  of  resources  undermine  industrial \ncompetitiveness and constrain economic growth. The government aims to decrease urban\u2013rural \nincome  disparity  and  diversify  from  hydrocarbon-export  industries  by  increased  economic \nactivity,  which  requires  reliable  electricity.  Rehabilitation  and  expansion  of  the  distribution \nnetwork is now considered the priority for future energy sector investments.  \n \n5.  The government owns and manages the energy sector in Azerbaijan, and is committed \nto sector reform with the aim of improving system efficiency, supply reliability, and transparency. \nAs the first reform step, all power distribution assets and functions were entirely separated from \nthe  state-owned  company\u2014Azerenerji  OJSC 7 \u2014and  transferred  to  another  state-owned \ncompany\u2014Azerishiq OJSC8 (formerly Bakielektrikshebeke OJSC, i.e., Baku Electric Company). \nThrough  unbundling,  the  government  will  improve  the  sector  operation  efficiency  and \ntransparency by separating cost centers into different networks, supporting commercialization, \nand  holding  each  company  accountable  for  its  performance.  Further  unbundling  of  the \ngeneration and transmission assets is under consideration by the government. Through the \nimplementation of the Power Distribution Enhancement Investment Program, the efficiency and \ntransparency of the distribution network is expected to substantially improve, which will support \nfurther sector reform especially unbundling. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is supporting \nthe government\u2019s reform efforts through a technical assistance for encouraging private sector \nparticipation in the power sector. 9 A road map for private sector participation in Azerbaijan\u2019s \nenergy sector has been drafted and is expected to be finalized in 2016. \n \n6.  The distribution system in Baku, the capital city, has received significant investment from \nthe  state  budget,  creating  a  modern  and  technically  efficient  system.  Concurrent  with  the \ntechnical improvements, Azerishiq OJSC instigated a rigorous loss reduction and collection \nimprovement program in Baku, installing modern metering, operating a modern tamper-proof \nbilling system, and ensuring all customers paid on time. As a result of this program, distribution \nlosses have been reduced to levels similar to those in many European countries. Azerishiq \nOJSC intends to replicate the successful experience in Baku in the rest of the country by 2020.  \n \n7.  At present, the energy sector is facing a funding shortage with tariffs that do not cover \ncapital costs. The retail electricity tariff for 2014 was AZN0.06/kWh (including value-added tax). \nThe tariff is adequate to operate the existing network but insufficient to rehabilitate and augment \nthe  network.  Financial  and  tariff  reform  will  be  required  to  meet  Azerishiq  OJSC\u2019s  future \ninvestment requirements.  \n \n8.  Sector road map. The government has made a strong commitment to provide adequate \nand reliable electricity supply to all consumers by 2020, as reflected in the country\u2019s medium-\nterm development framework Azerbaijan 2020: Look into the Future.10 The inclusive growth \n                                                \n7   Before February 2015, OJSC Azerenerji was a vertically integrated and 100% state-owned enterprise in charge of \nelectricity generation, transmission, and distribution except for distribution in Baku and Nakhchivan. Azerenerji has \nestablished  separate  business  units  to  manage  the  transmission  and  generation  assets  accordingly,  and \nimprovement in its governance and operation efficiency is ongoing. \n8  Azerishiq OJSC is a 100% state-owned enterprise responsible for electricity distribution, supply, and other \ncustomer  services  (connection,  metering,  and  billing)  in  Azerbaijan,  except  the  functions  in  Nakhchivan \nAutonomous Republic, which is directly administered by the state energy agency of Nakhchivan Autonomous \nRepublic. The national distribution networks administrated by Azerishiq comprise seven regional networks, i.e., \nAran, Baku, Canub, Garb, Markazi Aran, Shimal, and Shimal Garb. \n9  ADB. 2014.

Baku. \n ", "3 \nagenda consists of high social welfare, sustainable economic growth, broad opportunities and \ndecent jobs for all, reduced regional inequalities, and access of remote villages to public utilities. \nA  Presidential  order  was  issued  on  10  February  2015,  which  sets  the  energy  sector \nrestructuring targets and actions to be taken.11 The order requires Azerishiq OJSC to take all \nnecessary actions to modernize the distribution network and provide consumers in Azerbaijan \nwith reliable, safe, and efficient power supply. \n \n9.  The government recognizes that the establishment of a full-cost recovery tariff is one of \nthe factors that will ensure efficient use of the energy resources. The government undertakes to \nachieving full cost recovery for Azerishiq OJSC by 2022, by pursuing financial and tariff reform \nand  gradually  adjusting  the  tariff  level  and  structure,  taking  into  account  cost  reduction, \nefficiency  improvement,  and  targeted  financial  support  from  the  government  to  protect \nvulnerable customers groups. ADB will support the government to develop and implement an \nenergy sector financial recovery plan.12 \n \n10.  Strategic  context. The proposed investment program is closely aligned with ADB\u2019s \nMidterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020  and  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2014\u20132018  for \nAzerbaijan.13 ADB is committed to supporting improved energy efficiency and operation so as to \nprovide adequate and reliable energy supply throughout the country. This can then stimulate \nnew, non-oil economic activities, promote inclusive growth, and reduce urban\u2013rural disparities. \nThe investment program contributes to achieving ADB\u2019s Energy Policy objectives of promoting \nenergy efficiency, access to energy for all, and capacity building and governance.14  \n \n11.  Major lessons from previous ADB interventions in the energy sector are incorporated in \nthe program design, which include the need for (i) continuous dialogue with the government on \ntariff issues to promote energy sector reform, (ii) capacity building for power utilities, and (iii) \ngood governance and commercialization. ADB provided Azerenerji OJSC with a loan of $160 \nmillion  to  finance  power  transmission  improvement. 15 The  ongoing  interventions  include \ntechnical assistance for preparing a pilot renewable energy project (biomass cogeneration)16 \nand policy and advisory technical assistance (footnote 9). The proposed investment program \ncomplements ongoing assistance in facilitating low-carbon development and climate resilience \nthrough improved energy efficiency. \n \n12.  Policy framework. The overall vision of the government\u2019s energy sector strategy is to \nutilize domestic energy resources efficiently, protect the country\u2019s energy security, and ensure \nthe delivery of reliable and adequate energy services throughout the country. The energy sector \npolicy framework17 features (i) promoting efficient use of energy resources and increasing sector \noperation efficiency, (ii) establishing a sound regulatory environment to promote competition, (iii) \n                                                \n11  Government of Azerbaijan. 2015.

The State Program for Development \nof Fuel and Energy Sector in Azerbaijan for 2016\u20132025 is under preparation. The government has confirmed that \nthe sector policy contained within the existing state program for 2005\u20132015, and the key priority areas identified \ntherein, will be incorporated in the state program for the next planning period and continue to be implemented. \n ", "4 \nimproving  the  sector  structure  to  attract  more  investments,  (iv)  promoting  sustainable \ndevelopment to ensure environmental protection, (v) strengthening financial discipline in the \nsector and ensuring full payment for energy consumption, and (vi) increasing the share of \nrenewable energy in power generation. \n \n13.  To achieve the vision of long-term development, the following main goals have been \nidentified: (i) ensuring that power needs are fully met, (ii) facilitating gradual revision of tariffs to \nachieve full cost recovery, (iii) improving the efficiency of operations and promoting financial and \noperational transparency, (iv) promoting energy efficiency and alternative energy technologies, \nand (v) encouraging private sector participation. \n \n14.  Investment program. An energy sector master plan has been prepared with a technical \nassistance  from  ADB18 and  other  development  partners.  The  master  plan  sets  out  an \ninvestment strategy for the power generation, transmission, and distribution subsectors19 and \nforms the basis of the Azerishiq Investment Plan (2015\u20132025). The plan envisages the total \ninvestment for distribution network improvement in 2015\u20132025 at about $4.6 billion.20 The ADB-\nsupported  investment  program  of  $1.0  billion  represents  approximately  22%  of the  overall \nrequirement  and  selects  priority  investment  components.  The  investment  program  will  be \nundertaken in sequence and cover all distribution networks in  seven regions: Aran, Baku, \nCanub, Garb, Markazi Aran, Shimal, and Shimal Garb. The immediate priority for investment in \nthe distribution network is to rehabilitate the distribution networks that currently experience \nfrequent system outages and supply interruptions to customers.  \n \n15.  Multitranche financing facility. The MFF will allow ADB to establish a stronger long-\nterm partnership with the government meeting its development goals, support energy sector \nreform, improve energy policies, and strengthen governance and capacities.   Rehabilitation and \nenhancement of the distribution network will require substantial capital, which cannot be taken \non by the government at once. The MFF enables ADB to finance the investment programs \nsequentially matching Azerishiq\u2019s implementation capacity. The MFF modality supports high \nproject  readiness  and  timely  implementation,  such  as  support  for  project  design,  advance \nprocurement, and safeguard due diligence being conducted upfront.  \n \n16.  The proposed investment program has the following key benefits: (i) support to the \ngovernment in achieving its strategic development targets, (ii) introduction of modern technology \nand improvements in energy efficiency, (iii) support to Azerishiq OJSC to improve corporate \ngovernance and transparency, (iv) knowledge and skills transfer via the training of power utility \nstaff to international standards in the implementation of the latest technology, and (v) improving  \nelectricity  supply  service  quality  and  enhancing  productivity  of  small-  and  medium-sized \nenterprises. The investment program will benefit 1.45 million customers, of which 60% are \nresidential customers. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n17.  The  investment  program\u2019s  impact  will  be  increased  availability  of  reliable  electricity \nsupply to all domestic consumers. The outcome will be improved efficiency and reliability of the \npower distribution networks. \n                                                \n18  ADB. 2014.

Outputs \n \n18.  The investment program has three components, which are expected to be implemented \nthrough three tranches with each tranche covering all seven regional distribution networks. The \nTranche 1 and subsequent tranches will have similar  components but only with regard to \ndifferent districts under each regional network, which are selected based on the priority and \nimplementation capacity of Azerishiq OJSC.   \n(i)  Rehabilitation  of  distribution  networks.  This  involves  rehabilitation  and \naugmentation of aging medium- and low-voltage distribution networks including \n6\u2013110 kilovolt (kV) substations and distribution lines. \n(ii)  Rehabilitation of customer service lines and installation of smart meters.21 \nThis includes replacement of 0.4 kV customer service lines including installation \nof  smart  meters.  The  existing  0.4  kV  bare  overhead  conductors  will  be \ncompletely  replaced  with  new  self-supporting aerial  bundled  cables, and  the \nexisting poles will be replaced. The new cables will prevent energy theft. \n(iii)  Support for institutional strengthening. This includes (a) capacity building and \ntraining for financial management, accounting and auditing, project management, \nprocurement,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  social  and  environmental \nsafeguards; (b) a public information campaign for energy efficiency improvement \nand tariff reform; and (c) improvement of operation and maintenance facilities in \nthe Azerishiq OJSC regional distribution networks. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans   \n \n19.  The investment program is estimated to cost $1.0 billion (Table 1). Azerishiq OJSC has \nrequested ADB to provide an MFF of up to $750 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \nto help finance part of the investment program. The MFF is expected to comprise three tranches, \nsubject to Azerishiq OJSC\u2019s submission of related periodic financing requests, execution of the \nrelated  legal  agreements  for  each  tranche,  and  fulfillment  of  terms  and  conditions  and \nundertakings set forth in the framework financing agreement. The first tranche loan will be \nfinanced from ordinary capital resources and guaranteed by Azerbaijan. The loan will have a 25-\nyear term, including a grace period of 5 years, with custom-tailored repayment; an annual \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan and guarantee agreements. \n \nTable 1: Investment Program  \n($ million) \nItem  MFFa  Tranche 1 \nA.

Azerishiq OJSC will serve as the executing agency and be responsible for the overall \ninvestment program. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will be the focal point for overall \ncoordination  of  intergovernment  agencies.  Azerishiq  OJSC  has  established  a  project \nmanagement unit (PMU) for the implementation of the entire MFF.  \n \n23.  For procurement of the turnkey contracts for 35 kV/10 kV substations and complete \ntransformer  substations,  national  competitive  bidding  method  will  be  used  by  applying  full \ninternational competitive bidding procedures and using ADB\u2019s standard bidding document but \npermitting (i) submission of bids in Azeri language and (ii) bid comparison based on the total \ncost at destination including all taxes and duties. This approach takes into account the nature of \nturnkey contracts, the present condition of local industry, the wide geographic spread of works \nacross seven regional networks, and sufficient availability of domestic contractors based on \nAzerishiq\u2019s  previous  successful  experience  and  market  survey.  It  aims  to  encourage  the \ndevelopment  of  domestic  contracting  and  manufacturing  industries  while  ensuring  open \ncompetition to international and national bidders. ADB will closely review the bidding process of \nthese contracts and require further adjustments as necessary to ensure open competition.  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical  \n \n24.  The distribution investments are prioritized and optimized to meet the projected demand, \nand reflect appropriate design and planning standards. The latest technology will be applied in \nproject design, installation, and operation.23 Detailed subproject descriptions and technical due \ndiligence are provided in a technical due diligence report.24   \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n25.  Economic  and  financial  analyses  will  be  carried  out  for  each  tranche  under  the \ninvestment program. For the first tranche, the project investments yield an economic internal \nrate of return of 13.4%, exceeding the economic opportunity cost of 12.0%. The economic \nbenefits are based on reduction of outages and distribution losses in the comparison of with- \nand without- project cases. The economic internal rate of return exceeds the minimum rate for \nall the sensitivities, and thus the project is considered economically viable. To improve the \nsector\u2019s financial sustainability, the government undertakes to implement a cost-recovery tariff \nby 2022. Incorporating the estimation of the cost-recovery tariff, the project yields a financial \ninternal rate of return of \u20132.5%. To the extent that Azerishiq OJSC is not able to fully recover its \n                                                \n23  State-of-the-art equipment\u2014such as transformers and digital control, protection, and telecommunication facilities; \nand smart meters and billing system\u2014will be introduced to improve system operation efficiency and reliability. \n24  Technical Due Diligence Report (accessible from the list of supplementary linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n ", "8 \ncosts through future tariff revenues and comply with the financial covenants of the loan, the \ngovernment has also agreed to provide budgetary support. The program\u2019s targeted outcomes \non reduced distribution losses and improved revenue collection, in combination with the tariff \nreform, will increase Azerishiq OJSC\u2019s cash flow and improve its overall financial sustainability. \nThe program will result in an 8% reduction in distribution losses and a 25% increase in revenue \ncollection  by  2022.  Based  on  the  2015  tariff  level  of  AZN0.06/kWh  ($0.057/kWh),  a  1% \nreduction in distribution losses will lead to a revenue increase of $10.8 million, and a 1% \nincrease in collection rate will lead to a revenue increase of $8.0 million. A TA project to develop \na tariff methodology and a public information program for energy efficiency improvement and \ntariff increase will be conducted during project implementation to support the government\u2019s \nefforts in implementing tariff reform. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n26.  The  governance  risks  for  Azerishiq  OJSC,  including  its  financial  management  and \nprocurement capacities, were assessed. Overall, the financial management risk is assessed to \nbe  substantial.25 Azerishiq  OJSC\u2019s  financial  management  arrangements,  coupled  with  the \nproposed mitigation measures described in the FAM, are considered adequate to manage the \nfinances  of  the  project  facilities.  The  procurement  risks  are  substantial  and  the  mitigation \nmeasures are described in the procurement capacity assessment.26 Currently, the PMU handles \nprocurement with support from international and national procurement experts engaged by ADB. \nThe PMU staff have received procurement capacity training from ADB. \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and Azerishiq OJSC. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the FAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n28.  The investment program will result in positive impacts on improved reliability of electricity \nsupply at the household level. This, in turn, will lead to decreased household spending on solid \nand liquid fuels for heating, cooking, and lighting, and the associated indoor air quality issues. \nHouseholds will also be able to use more labor-saving electrical appliances without risk of \ndamage due to power voltage fluctuations. The program is also expected to contribute to \nimproved income-generating opportunities by providing reliable electricity to small industries and \nagricultural  businesses.  The  adverse  impacts  of  distribution  network  upgrading  and \nrehabilitation will be minimized as much as possible and it will be ensured that they will not \ncause physical or economic displacement to the community, including women. The specific \ngender development measures under the investment program include (i) at least 20% of female \nstaff from Azerishiq will be trained in key aspects of distribution network management; (ii) newly \nrecruited customer care jobs under the program will include at least 80% female staff members; \n(iii) at least 50% female representation will be ensured in the consultation process during the \nproject implementation period. The investment program is classified as having some gender \nelements.  \n \n \n                                                \n25  By 31 May 2016, Azerishiq is expected to submit its first audited entity financial statements as of 31 December  \n     2015, after its take over of the distribution business from Azerenerji outside the Baku area. \n26  Procurement Capacity Assessment (accessible from the list of the linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nE.  Safeguards \n \n29.  Environment. An environmental assessment and review framework was prepared for \nthe MFF program, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), and it provides \nthe environmental management procedures to be adopted for future tranches. Tranche 1 project \nis classified environment category B as impacts are mostly concentrated during the construction \nphase  and  can  be  addressed  through  proper  focused  mitigation  measures.  An  initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE)  has  been  conducted  for  the  project.  The  IEE  provides \nenvironmental management plans for each type of project activity and covers all the likely \nimpacts. The IEE concluded that the project is not likely to cause any significant adverse \nenvironmental impacts. Public consultations were conducted in January 2015 as part of the IEE \nprocess; the IEE and environmental assessment and review framework were disclosed on the \nADB website.  \n \n30.  Involuntary resettlement. The resettlement due diligence carried out for the tranche 1 \nproject  suggests  there  are  no  involuntary  resettlement  impacts,  therefore  the  tranche  is \ncategorized C for involuntary resettlement impacts in accordance with the Safeguard Policy \nStatement. However, a land acquisition and resettlement framework has been prepared to guide \nthe preparation of subsequent tranches and the implementation of tranche 1. \n \n31.  Indigenous people. Tranche 1 is categorized C for indigenous peoples. There are no \nindigenous people in the project vicinity as defined by the Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n32.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.27 The integrated benefits and impacts of the \ninvestment program are expected to outweigh the cost of the risk mitigating measures.  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nProcurement   The procurement activities, including bidding document \nWeak procurement capacity of Azerishiq  preparation, bid evaluation, contract negotiation, and award, \nOJSC staff to follow ADB\u2019s procurement  will be adequately supported by international procurement \nprocedure  and technical experts. \n   \nFragmentation of contracts into small  The agreed master bidding documents for NCB will be \nlots in the procurement plan and both  strictly followed; the bidding process and the result will be \nlocal firms\u2019 and executing agency\u2019s  closely monitored; adjustment of packaging, if needed, will \ncapacity to implement so many contracts  be considered in a timely manner; ADB prior or post reviews \nis a challenge.  will specifically assess if any complaints received by foreign \nfirms.
