I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof up to CNY150,000,000.00 to Tedahang Cold Chain Logistics for the Tianjin Cold Chain \nLogistics Facility Development Project in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n1.  Project Identification \n \n2.  Along with the rapid economic growth in the PRC came a significant increase in the \ndemand for fresh produce and a wider range of meat and fish products. According to the China \nFederation of Logistics and Purchasing in 2007, demand for logistics service in the PRC had \nreached  CNY75.2  billion,  a  year-on-year  increase  of  26.2%;  and  cargo  volume  reached \n22.53 billion tons, a year-on-year increase of 10.7%.1 However, because of lack of proper \ninfrastructure, food is transported and stored without a controlled environment\u2014shortening the \nshelf life and resulting in higher spoilage rates. This has significantly increased demand for \nrefrigerated or cold chain logistics.  \n \n3.  A cold chain is a temperature-controlled supply chain that forms a critical element in an \nuninterrupted  series  of  storage  and  distribution  activities.  It  helps  ensure  the  shelf  life  of \nproducts such as fresh agricultural produce, frozen food, photographic film, chemicals, and \npharmaceutical drugs. This process is preferred because of its ability to prolong the quality of \nperishable goods. Throughout the process of production, storage, transportation, and delivery to \nthe  consumer,  these  products  must  be  maintained  in  a  low  temperature  environment  to \npreserve their quality. In developed countries such as Australia, Canada, and the United States \n(US), a seamless cold chain logistics system for agricultural products is a fundamental part of \nlogistics infrastructure and the cold chain network has average coverage of 80%\u2013100% of the \nmarket. In the US, frozen food transport amounts to 20 million tons annually, encompassing \nalmost  3,000  varieties  of  products,  and  equates  to  per  capita  consumption  of  almost \n60 kilograms. \n \n4.  If approved, the project will be the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) first intervention \nin logistics in the PRC.2 Cold chain logistics is a relatively nascent industry in the PRC, so the \nproposed intervention from ADB will highlight the importance of logistics in relation to food \nsafety. This is in line with the Food Safety Law, 2009, which establishes and improves the food \nsafety management system and adopts efficient management measures to ensure food safety \nin the PRC. It is also in line with the 12th Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015, which calls for the \ndevelopment of a modern logistics industry in the PRC.3 The facility can be used as a model for \nbest  practices  in  international  common  warehouse  management  systems,  logistics \nmanagement, and trading systems. ADB can leverage the project to higher-level dialogue with \nthe Government of the PRC to develop optimal health, sanitary, and phytosanitary inspection \nprotocols for refrigerated freight.  \n                                                \n1 ResearchInChina. 2008.

The Project will be the first nonsovereign public sector project processed by PSOD since April 2012. \n3 Sector Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) ", "2   \n5.  The project will also play a positive role in supporting regional cooperation, particularly \nbetween the PRC and Mongolia. ADB supports PRC\u2013Mongolia cooperation under the broad \nframework and as an integral part of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) \nprogram.  One  of  the  key  objectives  of  PRC\u2013Mongolia  cooperation  in  transport  and  trade \nfacilitation areas is to improve Mongolia\u2019s access to international markets. As a landlocked \ncountry, Mongolia relies on the PRC for the nearest sea access. Tianjin, which is located at the \nsouth end of the CAREC transport corridor 4b linking Mongolia and the PRC, has since the \n1990s served as the only seaport for bulk of Mongolia\u2019s international trade based on a bilateral \nagreement signed in 1991. As part of the assistance to PRC\u2013Mongolia cooperation in trade \nfacilitation, ADB has been making efforts to improve ties between Mongolia\u2019s foreign trade \ncommunities and their counterparts in Tianjin.4 The enhanced capacity in cold chain logistics in \nTianjin to be realized under the project will help provide better services to Mongolia\u2019s export of \nagricultural produce, particularly meat and dairy products. \n \n6.  Tianjin Binhai TEDA Logistics Group (TBTL) is a leading logistics service provider in \nTianjin, which is a key port in the northeastern seaboard.5 TBTL is 70% owned by the state6 and \n30% listed on the Growth Enterprise Market of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. TBTL is active \nin a number of logistics areas through wholly- or majority-owned subsidiaries, such as container \nyard operation, bulk commodities (steel alloys in particular), logistics for Toyota automobiles and \nparts, as well as short-term financing services for small and medium-sized enterprises. Cold \nchain logistics presents a new opportunity for TBTL to fulfill an opportunity in the market and \naddress the lack of facilities and services in Tianjin Binhai New Area. \n \n7.  Through  due  diligence,  the  project  team  has  confirmed  TBTL\u2019s  financial  and \nmanagement capabilities and efficient operations. In addition to supporting TBTL in its new \nventure,  the  project  will  lead  to  additional  development  impacts  through  private  sector \nparticipation in a new industry, policy dialogue, and improved trade facilitation. \n \n2.  Project Design \n \n8.  TBTL is allocating existing resources to explore new businesses and diversification of \nrevenue sources. It purchased 9 hectares (ha) of land in 2007 and 8 ha in 2009 in the Tianjin \nport area. After detailed market research and consultation with Tianjin Commodity Inspection \nBureau and other government departments, TBTL determined that the cold chain logistics \nmarket would be a suitable new venture. Tianjin port has no cold storage, customs inspection, \nor special inspection facilities\u2014providing a compelling opportunity for a third-party operator. The \nland purchased is intended for frozen food warehouses and as a location for related customs, \nhealth, and phytosanitary inspections.  \n \n9.  Tedahang Cold Chain Logistics (TCCL) is a joint venture project company among TBTL, \nToyota Tsusho, and Kamigumi focused on the cold chain logistics business. For TBTL, TCCL \nwill be a market entry point to the cold chain logistics industry. The project will enable TBTL to \ncapture the rapid growth in logistics, while serving as a model for the development of the cold \n                                                \n4  During a PRC\u2013Mongolia joint consultation workshop on regional cooperation held in the PRC in May 2011 under \nregional technical assistance (ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance for the Development of Regional Cooperation \nPrograms for Mongolia and the People\u2019s Republic of China [Phase 2]. Manila [TA 7618-REG]), ADB organized a \nfield trip for the Mongolian government officials and business community representatives to Tianjin. The Mongolian \ndelegates had discussions with various authorities in Tianjin port, and visited Tianjin Binhai TEDA Logistics Group. \nBoth sides expressed strong interest in cooperating in the trade logistics area.  \n5  Tianjin Binhai TEDA Logistics Group. http://www.tbtl.cn/en/01.aspx \n6  Held by TEDA, Tianjin municipal government\u2019s investment arm.  ", "  3 \nchain  logistics  industry  in  the  PRC.  Lastly,  it  will  lead  to  downstream  development  and \nexpansion to cold chain transport, general commercial cold storage, and related cold chain \nlogistics business. TBTL believes its cold chain logistics facility will help Mongolia\u2019s export of \nmeat and related products; and it has had discussions with Mongolian counterparts, including \nthe Ministry of Agriculture, for the proposal and has received encouraging feedback. TBTL also \nbelieves that its long-term partnership with Toyota will be highly complementary in expanding \nthe cold chain logistics supply chain once the current project matures. \n \n10.  Located in Tianjin Port Container Logistics Center, the site will have a large-capacity \ncold storage facility\u2014including merchandise handling, warehousing, logistics equipment, and \ninspection facility\u2014combined with a customs inspection service facility for fruits and vegetables, \nmeat, and aquatic products. Three cold storage warehouses and affiliated facilities will be built \nat a total cost of CNY600 million. The cold storage houses will have various temperature \nzones\u2014from a deep cold of \u201350\u00b0C for seafood to below \u201320\u00b0C for most meats and above 0\u00b0C \nfor vegetables, fruits, and flowers. The facility will cover about 8 ha, including the main function \nbuildings; housing customs inspection facility for large cold storage shipments; refrigerated \ncontainer yard; and logistics, office, and supporting ancillary facilities.  \n \n3.  The Sponsor \n \n11.  TBTL  was  established  on  26  June  2006  with  CNY354  million  registered  capital.  It \nintegrated the logistics resources of Tianjin TEDA Investment Holding and TEDA State-Owned \nAssets Operation Corporation. TBTL was listed on the Growth Enterprise Market of Hong Kong \nStock Exchange on 30 April 2008. It is a holding company, with its subsidiary companies and \njointly  controlled  entities  providing  comprehensive  logistics  service  systems,  including \nspecialized electronic parts logistics services, professional general bonded warehouse logistics \nservices, and logistics financing and bulk commodities trading.  \n \n12.  As an industry leader in Tianjin Binhai New Area, TBTL has invested in infrastructure \nfacility resources and a logistics management system, thus gaining extensive experience and \nmanagement  technologies  for  logistics  services.  TBTL  intends  to  integrate  the  traditional \nlogistics industry with the manufacturing and finance industries, streamlining the current supply \nchain and optimizing internal management. In 2010, TBTL\u2019s businesses grew with the recovery \nof the macroeconomic environment. It experienced growth in logistics and supply chain services \nfor transportation of finished automobile and electronic components; materials procurement; and \ntraditional logistics services such as stacking yard, logistics supervision, and agency services. \n \n13.  Revenue and profits in 2010 were the highest since the public listing in 2008, while 2011 \nrevenues suffered as a result of the earthquake in Japan and the tightening of monetary policy \nin the PRC. TBTL will continue to optimize its business structure by repositioning its business \nfocus and customer base, and improving capital utilization efficiency with respect to materials \nprocurement and related logistics services.  \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n14.  Impact. The project will address the growing concern over food safety caused by lack of \ninfrastructure in cold chain storage and distribution through the following: \n \n(i)  Increased trade of agriculture products between Mongolia and the PRC. The \nproject will improve access to the import\u2013export market for agricultural produce \nthrough the provision of cold chain handling, storage, and inspection services. It will \n ", "4   \nalso facilitate trade of agricultural products for Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, \nMongolia,  and  the  PRC  as  improved  temperature-controlled  environment  and \nmaterial-handling capacity can make new agricultural and industrial products viable \nfor export markets. \n(ii)  Increased capacity in PRC cold chain logistics. By providing additional storage \nin  Tianjin  port,  the  project  will  increase  the  capacity  for  cold  chain  logistics\u2014\nreducing food wastage resulting from inappropriate food storage. \n(iii)  Wider  adoption  of  best  practices  in  warehouse  management,  logistics \nmanagement,  and  trading  systems.  The  project  will  introduce  modern  best \npractice  in  international  common  warehouse  management  system,  logistics \nmanagement, and trading system; and can potentially be a demonstration project \nfor setting industry standards for cold chain logistics. TCCL will also collaborate \nwith Tianjin Commodity Inspection Bureau and Tianjin Customs to develop optimal \nhealth, sanitary, and phytosanitary inspection protocol for refrigerated freight.  \n \n15.  Outcome. The outcome will be the improved efficiency and capacity of logistics facilities \nin  Tianjin  port.  The  development  of  improved  logistics  facilities  critical  for  agricultural \ntransportation and storage will increase capacity in handling perishable products.  \n \n16.  Outputs. The physical outputs will be the completion of the cold storage facility and the \nadoption of best practices in warehouse logistics management and trading systems. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n \n17.  The project is consistent with Strategy 2020 in terms of inclusive economic growth in \ndeveloping  and  expanding  economic  activities  by  increasing  access  to  new  markets  for \nagricultural  products.7 The  project  is  also  consistent  with  two  of  the  five  core  areas  of \noperational  focus  identified:  infrastructure  and  regional  cooperation  and  integration.  ADB\u2019s \nintervention in the project aims to (i) increase policy dialogue; (ii) encourage the participation of \nprivate capital for developing the refrigerated supply-chain and logistics infrastructure facility \nthat will bring in state-of-the-art technology, know-how, and processes, with benefits in material-\nhandling capacity and improved energy efficiency; and (iii) facilitate Mongolia\u2019s international \ntrade of agriculture products. Additionally, development of the facility will foster improvements in \ntransportation logistics and customs management, leading to more efficient traffic, facilitating \ntrade of frozen produce, reducing transit cost, and fostering increased trade.  \n \n18.  The project is in line with the PRC country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 through \npillar 1: inclusive growth, seeking to foster a balanced and equitable development, including \nlending activities in regional and subregional infrastructure projects.8 Furthermore, the project \nwill address transport connectivity and trade facilitation to promote transport and trade activities \nalong economic corridors, (in particular CAREC Corridor 4b), one of the drivers of change. The \ndevelopment  of the  refrigerated  supply-chain  and  logistics facility  will  reduce spoilage  and \nincrease the value of agricultural produce. \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n8  ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2011\u20132015. Manila. ", "  5 \n19.  Pillar  1  of  the  regional  cooperation  and  integration  strategy  states  that  physical \nconnections\u2014particularly  robust  transport  and  communication  links\u2014are  essential  for  the \nmovement of goods, services, people, and information across countries; and is thus a central \nelement of regional and subregional cooperation programs in Asia and the Pacific. 9 However, \nphysical connectivity needs to be supported by harmonization of regulations, procedures, and \nstandards;  improved  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks;  and  efficient  systems  of  customs \nclearance. The Project is in close alignment with elements of this strategy \n \n2.  Lessons from Previous Operations \n \n20.  In terms of food safety, ADB technical assistance (TA) for the National Food Safety \nRegulatory and Strategic Framework was implemented to help strengthen the State Food and \nDrug Administration through formulation of a comprehensive framework covering food safety \npolicies, laws and regulations, and standards, as well as cross-agency coordination to ensure \ntheir effective implementation. The TA recommendation for reforms was communicated in two \ncore  areas\u2014institutional  reform  for  streamlining  and  improved  coordination\u2014and  has \ncontributed to the draft Food Safety Law, which is a substantial improvement from previously \nfragmented legislation, and a meaningful step toward a comprehensive legal framework.10 \n \n21.  Current ADB operations in logistics and trade facilitation include the Regional Logistics \nDevelopment  Project  in  Mongolia,11 which  will  be  implemented  in  Zamyn  Uud  to  promote \neconomic growth necessary to reduce rural poverty resulting from inadequate transport services \nand high costs. Logistics development in Zamyn Uud is part of the program for the integrated \ndevelopment of a free economic zone in this poor region, which shares borders with the PRC \nand is the main gateway for Mongolia\u2019s trade with the PRC and other parts of the world. \n \n22.  Another  intervention  is the  Customs  Modernization  Project,12 which  aims  to finance \n(i) the  establishment  of  the  Mongolian  customs  automated  information  system;  (ii)  the \nimprovement  of  infrastructure  at  major  customs  houses  and  customs  border  posts;  and \n(iii) institutional strengthening, including business process reengineering, capacity building in \nrelation to the above two components, interagency coordination, regional cooperation, and \npublic\u2013private  partnerships.  The  expected  impact  is  increased  volume  and  efficiency  of \nMongolia\u2019s international trade.  \n  \n23.  These ADB interventions will form the foundation for the development of the proposed \nproject, which will complement the Zamyn Uud Project by facilitating transportation of Mongolian \nproducts requiring a temperature-controlled environment and facilitate trade in new markets. In \nfood safety, the project will contribute to establishing a platform for proper storage of perishable \ngoods. The lessons learned from previous operations include the importance that needs to be \nattributed to (i) rigorous analysis of the transaction financials, including stress testing of the \ndemand projections to factor in potential market disruptions; (ii) a clear review of the sponsors \ninvolved in the transaction; and (iii) clear awareness of the parties involved. \n \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2006.

Table 3 summarizes the implementation arrangements. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements13 \n \nAspects  Arrangements \nManagement  TCCL is set up by TBTL as a joint venture project company in cooperation with \nKamigumi and Toyota. TBTL will retain a majority stake in TCCL and will retain (i) \ncontrol over management policy; (ii) budget, financial, and accounting procedures; \nand (iii) control of the board, and major project board resolutions. TBTL, Toyota, and \nKamigumi will appoint key management positions (e.g., general manager, financial \ncontroller, and chief engineer) depending on each shareholder\u2019s expertise. \nImplementation  Q4 2012\u2013Q4 2013 \nperiod \nConstruction  The engineering, procurement and construction contract was awarded on 6 July 2011 \narrangements  to China Railway Construction 18th Bureau Group. The specifications of the contract \ninclude the construction of the Cold Storage Warehouse No. 1 with an area of \n28,974.07 m2; 3,801.71 m2 of cargo handling space; and 1,433.60 m2 of refrigeration \nroom and transformer room, situated at Tianjin Port Container Logistics Center.  \nRevenue  The revenue stream is based on three major areas: storage, transport, and \nstructure  inspection. For all goods coming into the inspection process, fees are charged for \ntransport in and out of the compound, storage, loading and unloading, as well as \nvalue-added services such as sorting, labeling, and plastic wrapping. The fee \nstructure is based on market standards and reflects full cost recovery of the \noperational expenditures. \nCost structure  The cost structure is straightforward for the cold storage operations. Aside from staff \ncosts (42.5% of total operational cost), electricity is the primary source of expenditure \n(21.2%). Other costs include water supply, drainage, and heating but account for less \nthan 1% of the total operational cost. \nPerformance  TCCL will submit to ADB quarterly unaudited financial statements, annual audited \nmonitoring  financial statements, and environmental and social monitoring reports.

ADB\u2019s proposed loan for up to CNY150 million will be funded through ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources without government guarantee.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n27.  TBTL saw in ADB not just a source of financing for a relatively nascent industry in the \nPRC but more importantly, an alliance in creating high standards for logistics as well as setting \nthe  policy  framework  at  the  central  level.  ADB  has  assisted  the  central  government  in \nstrengthening the national food safety regulatory and strategic framework through TA approved \nin 2004 and completed in 2007, whereby high-level meetings have been conducted to help \ndevelop more consistent regulation for food safety (footnote 10). TBTL sees ADB\u2019s access to \nthe central government as an invaluable asset in promoting the establishment of benchmarks on \nlogistics handling and quality control. \n \n28.  Furthermore, ADB\u2019s participation in the project will add substantial value in the following: \n(i)  Facilitating dialogue for regional trade facilitation and integration of the logistics \nnetwork between the PRC and Mongolia and under the broader framework of the \nCAREC. \n(ii)  Encouraging  the  adoption  of  a  structured  framework  to  manage  social  and \nenvironmental safeguard concerns, which may become the benchmark for the \nsector in the PRC. \n(iii)  Enhancing  best  practices  in  corporate  governance  of  TCCL  in  maintaining \ntransparency and disclosure. \n(iv)  Providing financing at a longer tenure to ensure a proper match between the \nproject cash flows and the debt service obligations. \n \nC.  Risks  \n \n29.  Risks will include credit, market, regulatory, and operational risks. \n(i)  Guarantor risk. The full guarantee of TBTL is crucial to the overall credit of the \ntransaction, making it essential to confirm TBTL\u2019s capacity as guarantor.  Due \ndiligence confirmed TBTL\u2019s capacity to implement business strategies and its \nhistorical  track  record  to  diversify  or  consolidate  businesses  to  preserve  its \nfinancial integrity.  However, it is critical for TBTL to retain their capacity to deliver \non  their  full  and  unconditional  guarantee  on  the  project.  Covenants  in  the \nfinancing  documents  will  be  included  to  ensure  and  preserve  the  financial \nintegrity of the guarantor over the life of the loan. \n \n(ii)  Market risk.  Due diligence covered an assessment of critical factors driving \nmarket  risk,  e.g.,  project  industry\u2019s  barriers  to  entry;  uniqueness  of  TCCL\u2019s \nservice to the customs clearance process; key drivers for revenue generation; \nand the tariff structure.  The project\u2019s main advantage is its proximity to the \nTianjin port, which serves 17 provinces with a population of over 600 million, and \nwhere some 400,000 tons of frozen meats pass through, comprising 15% of all \n ", "8   \nfrozen meat consumed in the PRC. The tariff structure is expected to be market-\nbased and not heavily regulated with likely provisions for the pass-through of \nvariable costs.  \n(iii)  Regulatory risk.  Due diligence evaluated the level of government support and \ncollaboration between TCCL and the Customs and the Inspection Bureau (CIQ).  \nThe  CIQ  and  other  relevant  government  agencies  demonstrated  significant \nsupport for this project, which is in line with national development and food safety \npriorities. TCCL has also formed a symbiotic partnership with the CIQ in Tianjin, \nthe primary government agency to utilize this facility. CIQ deems TCCL as an \ninvaluable partner and values the project for its proximity to the port and its \ncontributions to increased efficiency of the inspection process. \n(iv)  Operations and maintenance risk. The on-site presence of Toyota Tsusho and \nKamigumi  as  early  as  3  months  before  the  project\u2019s  scheduled  commercial \noperations indicates that both sponsors, equipped with cold chain and systems \nmanagement expertise, are taking active roles in project development. Kamigumi \nbrings  substantial  expertise  in  cold  chain  management,  tested  and  proven \nthrough operational challenges experienced during the Kobe earthquake and the \n2011 tsunami in Japan.  Toyota Tsusho\u2019s experience in systems management is \nalso expected to be an asset to project operations.  To ensure continuous power \navailability, the project is connected to two substations within the Tianjin port, \nincluding one substation that supports storage of highly sensitive chemicals and \nis considered a priority station in the event of power rationing.    \n(v)  Completion risk. Construction of phase 1 is well under way, within budget, and \nexpected  to  be  completed  by  Q3  2012.    Engineering,  procurement  and \nconstruction  (EPC)  requirements  for  phase  2  have  also  been  prepared  for \ntendering and construction will begin end 2012. Construction design took 2 years \nto complete and have been vetted by Japanese and European consultants while \nconstruction  and  technology  design  is  overseen  by  Kamigumi  and  Toyota \nTsusho.  The  EPC  contractor  has  tested  capability  in  civil  works  with  an \nenforceable EPC contract under PRC regulation.  \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n30.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified \nunder category B for environment, category C for involuntary resettlement, and category C for \nindigenous peoples. The project is located in an industrial and logistics zone sited far from \nenvironmentally sensitive areas and receptors. Environmental impacts mainly involved dust, \nnoise,  and  vibration  generation  during  construction,  which  are  minimized  through \nimplementation of water sprinkling and cleaning system, use of low-noise powered mechanical \nequipment and hydraulic pile drivers. Domestic and construction solid wastes are collected and \ndelivered to designated off-site disposal locations. During operation, the risk from the use of \nammonia as a refrigerant is minimized and mitigated as fugitive emissions are expected to \ncomply with the national ambient air quality standard and ammonia will be stored in appropriate \ncylinders situated in restricted entry refrigerant rooms. An explosive-proof fan and ammonia \ndetector will also be installed, emergency response procedures will be in place, and staff will be \nproperly trained and provided with personal protective equipment. The land where the project \nwill be constructed covers 76,795.8 square meters (m2) and is under the name of TCCL. The ", "  9 \nland right period from the state is until 14 January 2060. In accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement, an initial environmental examination has been prepared and the borrower has \ncommitted to implement the environmental management plan and submit periodic monitoring \nreports  to  ADB. The  project  will  not  have  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  people \nimpacts during construction and operation, as confirmed during the due diligence site visit. \n \n31.  The  project  has  coordinated  with  the  adjacent  companies  and  other  stakeholders, \nsecured local clearances and endorsements, and established a grievance redress mechanism. \nThe  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  of  TCCL  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and \nenvironmental impacts are deemed adequate. TCCL and its contractors will comply with ADB\u2019s \nSocial Protection Strategy and report regularly to ADB on their compliance with national labor \nlaws and adherence to core labor standards.16 The project has no gender element features in \nthe project design. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy  \n \n32.  TCCL  and  TBTL  were  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  of  implementing  best  international \npractice relating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB \nwill  ensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting \ncorruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event \nof noncompliance.  \n \nC.  Investment Limitations  \n \n33.  The proposed loan is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and single-\nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n \n34.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment of the PRC\u2019s no objection to the proposed assistance to TCCL will be obtained. \nADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, \nfollowing approval of the proposed assistance by the Board of Directors. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n35.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of up to \nCNY150,000,000.00 to Tedahang Cold Chain Logistics for the Tianjin Cold Chain Logistics \nFacility Development Project in the People\u2019s Republic of China from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources, with such terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n \n30 August 2012\n                                                \n16 ADB. 2003.
