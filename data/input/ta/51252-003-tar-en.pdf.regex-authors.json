The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide a concessional loan of $30 million loan \nfrom its ordinary capital resources for subprogram 1 of the  Financial Market Development \nProgram.1 The indicative loan amount for subprogram 2 is $30 million from ADB\u2019s concessional \nordinary capital resources. The program aims to help the Government of Bhutan adopt timely \nreforms to enhance the efficiency, stability, and inclusiveness of the finance sector. The program \nwill support the government with implementing institutional reforms and will build the technical \ncapacity of regulators and financial institutions. \n \n2.  The proposed program\u2019s impact will be the improved economic welfare of the Bhutanese \npeople, especially women, through increased employment, private sector business development, \nenhanced access to finance, and greater efficiency of financial intermediation. By 2023, the total \nvalue of outstanding bonds is expected to reach Nu9.3 billion (about $130 million), an increase of \n7% from the 2018 baseline. This year-on-year growth of private sector credit provided by \ncommercial banks will increase from the average 2014\u20132018 baseline rate of 14.7% to at least \nan average of 17.0% for 2019\u20132023. The percentage of adults who have access to credit will \nreach at least 18.0% by 2023 compared to the 16.0% baseline of 2018. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  The  transaction technical  assistance (TA)  is  necessary  to  effectively  implement the \nprogram. ADB has consistently recognized and responded to Bhutan\u2019s substantial need and \ndemand for capacity building, the result of limited capacity and access to best practices among \ngovernment agencies. Continued reforms and new policies in the finance sector are necessary to \nsupport Bhutan\u2019s transition toward middle-income status. Past experience also confirms that ADB \nTA has not only facilitated the achievement of policy-based programs\u2019 reform actions, but that it \nhas also generated incremental reforms.2 The transaction TA will help the government formulate \nregulations and guidelines to implement the three areas of reform under the program, build the \ncapacity of the government agencies and financial institutions to implement the reforms under \nsubprogram 2 of the program, and provide training and capacity building to entrepreneurs and \nthe disadvantaged to promote financial inclusion. The transaction TA is listed in the country \noperations business plan for Bhutan, 2019\u20132021 (footnote 1).3 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n4.  The TA outputs will map major policy actions under the program and be implemented over \n27 months from December 2019 to March 2022. The TA will engage a total of 12 person-months \nof international consultancy services and 14 person-months of national consultancy services; the \nconsultants will work closely with the government, other relevant stakeholders, and ADB. The TA \nwill cover the following three outputs. \n \n5.  Output 1: Strategies and regulations developed. The TA will support the executing and \nimplementing agencies in  \n                                                \n1 The program is included for commitment in 2019 in ADB. 2018.

Output  3:  Knowledge  and  capacity  of  entrepreneurs  and  the  disadvantaged \nincreased. With the aim of raising the public's financial literacy levels in alignment with the \nNational Financial Inclusion Strategy, 2018\u20132023 and the National Financial Literacy Strategy, \n2018\u20132023,5 the TA will develop supporting systematic mechanisms for the RMA to carry out a \nfinancial literacy program to increase the capacity of entrepreneurs and disadvantaged groups in \naccessing finance by \n(i)  developing and implementing a gender-targeted financial literacy program; \n(ii) expanding the financial literacy curriculum framework beyond mainstream education and \nlocal government to include nonformal education and technical vocational education and \ntraining; \n(iii) developing a strategy for warehouse receipt financing to promote better access to finance, \nenabling farmers to use the receipts as collateral; and \n(iv) assisting the introduction of innovative financing schemes, such as an inclusive green \nfinance scheme, to promote access to finance by entrepreneurs seeking funding for \nenvironment-friendly projects. \n \nC.
