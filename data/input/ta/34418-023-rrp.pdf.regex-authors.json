THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Government of the \nNetherlands, both to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh, for the additional financing of the \nSouthwest Area Integrated Water Resources Planning and Management Project.1  \n \n2.  The  additional  financing  will  expand  the  success  of  the  current  project  to  nearby \ngeographical areas in the southwest of the country, aiming at enhancing the livelihood of the \nrural population by improving the productivity and sustainability of existing underperforming \nflood control, drainage, and irrigation (FCDI) schemes. It will address constraints on agriculture, \nfisheries, and livelihood development through holistic and participatory planning, development, \nand management of water and delivery of support services. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Water affects various aspects of the livelihoods of the rural population in Bangladesh. \nThe country is on a vast floodplain at the confluence of three major rivers, and has faced \nsignificant  physical  challenges  including  monsoon  floods,  changes  in  river  courses  due  to \nerosion and sedimentation, water scarcity in the dry season, cyclones, and widespread arsenic \ncontamination of groundwater. The productivity of agriculture, fisheries, and associated nonfarm \nindustries  is  susceptible  to  these  water-related  issues.  More  than  80%  of  poor  people  in \nBangladesh live in rural areas and depend on agriculture or fisheries for their livelihoods.2 \nDespite a fall in the share in the gross domestic product to 17% in FY2013, agriculture in \nBangladesh remains the largest employer, providing jobs for 48% of the population.3 Access to \nand effective management of water is essential to improved productivity and livelihoods for rural \npoor people. Water management is complicated by diverse interests among different water uses \nincluding for agriculture, fisheries, navigation, industries, and drinking water. \n \n4.  Chronic infrastructure deterioration of existing FCDI schemes, especially large-scale \nschemes,4 has impaired water management. The absence of stakeholder participation causes a \nlack of user ownership, which is followed by rapid deterioration of structures, inefficient and \nirrelevant planning, and inefficient water use. Managing critical water resources through an \nintegrated  and  participatory  approach  is  essential  for  efficient  water  management;  the \nsustainability of FCDI schemes; and improved livelihood of vulnerable poor people, including \nwomen. \n \n5.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  provided  finance  for  participatory  water \nmanagement projects for small-scale schemes since 1995.5 The schemes have demonstrated \nsuccess in improved infrastructure performance through beneficiary participation. To extend \nintegrated and participatory water management to large-scale FCDI schemes, in 2005 ADB \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  World Bank. 2014. World Development Indicators. Washington, DC. \n3  Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission. 2015. Agriculture Sector Development Strategy, Background \nPaper for Seventh Five-Year Plan. Dhaka. \n4  FCDI  schemes  with  command  areas  greater  than  1,000  hectares  (ha)  are  categorized  as  large-scale  in \nBangladesh. \n5  For example: ADB. 1995. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Small-Scale Water Resources Management Sector Project. Manila. ", "2 \napproved  a  $20  million  equivalent  loan  for  the  current  Southwest  Area  Integrated  Water \nResources  Planning  and  Management  Project.6 The  project  also  included  $12.5  million  of \ncofinancing  from  the  Government  of  the  Netherlands.  The  current  project  supports  the \nestablishment of participatory water management organizations (WMOs) with the inclusion of \nsocially disadvantaged groups; integrated water resources management planning; infrastructure \nrenovation; and coordinated support services for WMOs in the two pilot subprojects, comprising \nthe Narail and Chenchuri Beel FCDI schemes with a total area of 57,000 hectares (ha). \n \n6.  The  current  project  successfully  demonstrated  that  the  participatory  approach  can \nimprove the water resources management of large FCDI schemes. This is the first success case \nfor large schemes among several trials in Bangladesh. After a slow start-up as a result of delays \ndue mainly to limited experience of the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) in using \na participatory approach, the progress of the current project has significantly improved since \n2010. Renovation of water management infrastructure and improved capacity of WMOs in the \ntwo targeted subproject areas has been completed with satisfactory achievement of anticipated \ntargets. Rice production has nearly doubled and fish production has increased by 30% in the \ntwo  subproject  areas.7 In  total,  116  WMOs,  consisting  of  102  water  management  groups \n(WMGs) and 14 higher-tier water management associations (WMAs), have been organized and \ntrained  and  are  effectively  functioning  in  the  two  subproject  areas.  A  population  of  about \n191,200  has  benefitted  from  the  project,  including  socially  disadvantaged  groups  such  as \nlandless farmers and women. Capacity enhancement activities for WMOs are demonstrating \nvisible  proactive WMO activities  in  agriculture, fisheries,  livestock,  and  collective  livelihood \nactions. Operation and maintenance (O&M) of small structures have been handed over to \nWMOs,  after  development  of  O&M  manuals  and  WMO  O&M  capacity.  BWDB  acquired \nknowledge  of  and  experience  in  participatory  water  resources  planning  and  management \nthrough the current project. \n \n7.  The current project has been continuously rated on track since the second quarter of \n2011. Cumulative disbursement had reached about $20.3 million (or 95% of the total loan \namount)8 for the ADB loan and $12.3 million (98% of the total grant amount) for the Netherlands \ngrant as of 31 July 2015. The current project has been complying with all loan covenants, \nincluding requirements for environmental and involuntary resettlement safeguards and gender \nconsideration. \n \n8.  The proposed additional financing will replicate the successful current project in nine \nadditional subprojects with a total area of 84,000 ha and a population of about 469,500 in \nnearby  areas.  By  applying  knowledge  and  experience  acquired  from  the  current  project, \nBWDB\u2019s institutional capacity for participatory water resources management is expected to be \nenrooted.  Based  on  the  lessons  learned  through  the  current  project,  the  design  of  the \ninstitutional strengthening component will be further strengthened by establishment of a national \ncapacity enhancement support mechanism under BWDB to ensure sustainability of participatory \nwater resource management by WMOs. \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2005.

The \ndisbursed amount in dollars at $20.3 million exceeds the approved loan amount of $20.0 million because the loan \nis denominated in special drawing rights.   \n ", "3 \n9.  The project is in line with government and ADB strategies. Economic growth and poverty \nreduction are the main objectives of the government\u2019s Sixth Five-Year Plan, FY2011\u2013FY2015.9 \nAchieving food security is considered essential to accomplishing these objectives. Food security \nand agricultural productivity are also part of ADB\u2019s strategic priorities for 2014\u20132020 in the \naction plan of the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020.10 ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for \nBangladesh, 2011\u20132015 emphasizes innovative approaches to water resource management \nand  support  to  the  government\u2019s  objectives  for  rural  poverty  reduction,  food  security,  and \ngender equality.11 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The impact of the project will be enhanced economic growth and reduced poverty in \nrural areas of the selected districts in the southwest area of Bangladesh, aligned with the \ngovernment\u2019s  Sixth  Five-Year  Plan,  FY2011\u2013FY2015.  The  outcome  will  be  enhanced \nproductivity and sustainability of the selected existing FCDI systems, which could contribute to \nincreasing incomes and livelihood standards of disadvantaged groups, including women. The \nimpact and outcome statements are unchanged from the current project (footnote 1). \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n11.  The  output  targets  for  the  current  project  will  be  scaled  up  by  expanding  the \ngeographical areas from the current two subprojects to include nine additional subprojects. The \nscope and targets of the additional financing outputs are summarized in paragraphs 12\u201316. \n \n12.  Output  1:  Water  management  organizations\u2019  capacity  for  sustainable  water \nresources planning and management in the subproject areas strengthened. The additional \nfinancing  will  cover  formation  and  capacity  development  of  WMOs  in  the  additional  nine \nsubproject areas, aiming at enrollment of 70% of farmers. Follow-up support for O&M capacity \ndevelopment  will  also  be  provided  to  the  existing  102  WMGs  and  14  WMAs  in  the  two \nsubproject areas of the current project. An integrated water management plan will be prepared \nfor each subproject area. Each plan formulates holistic water resources management planning \nand safeguard assessments for the subproject, following intensive participatory analyses of \nlocal conditions and needs. Each subproject will be divided into hydrological subunits. WMAs \nwill be formed that will manage each subunit and lower-tier WMGs. A subunit implementation \nplan (SIP) will be prepared for each subunit. The plan will include specific requirements for \nrenovation or construction of water management infrastructure, and capacity development and \nlivelihood support programs for WMOs. \n \n13.  Subsequent to the preparation of SIPs, the project will support the WMOs to implement \nthe institutional development plan specified in the SIPs, including (i) capacity development \ntraining of executive committees and subgroups under WMOs, (ii) development of operational \nrules, (iii) registration, and (iv) establishment of a fee collection system for O&M services and \nother WMO activities. The project will also support skills development of WMOs for efficient use \nof water management infrastructure  to improve the productivity of agriculture and fisheries \nactivities, and for ensuring attention is given to all aspects of water resource management \nrelated to gender and social inclusion. The support will be linked to other income-generating \n                                                \n9  Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission. 2011.

An additional 150 WMGs are expected to be formed under the project, with \nthe inclusion of the socially disadvantaged and with 33% participation of women. \n \n14.  The project support will be extended to training and capacity development of WMOs for \nmonitoring civil works, routine minor maintenance of infrastructure, preparing O&M manuals, \nand effectively using WMO O&M funds. O&M responsibility for infrastructure will be transferred \nto WMAs or WMGs, depending on their functions and covering area, after completion of works \nand WMO O&M capacity development training. \n \n15.  Output  2:  Infrastructure  facilities  of  flood  control,  drainage,  and  irrigation \nschemes in the subproject areas restored. The second output will include renovation or \nconstruction of water management infrastructure, such as gated water retention structures, flood \nembankments, re-excavation of drainage and/or irrigation canals, and local riverbank protection \nworks, as specified in the SIPs. \n \n16.

BWDB, under the Ministry of Water Resources, will continue to be the executing agency. \nThe existing project management office for the current project under BWDB will continue to be \nresponsible for overall project implementation. Four new subproject management offices will be \nestablished to cover the subproject areas. The existing project steering committee will continue \nto undertake central interministerial coordination. A national technical coordination committee \nwill be formed for timely interdepartmental coordination for practical technical aspects. Relevant \ndepartments, such as the Department of Agriculture Extension and the Department of Fisheries, \nwill continue to provide technical inputs under BWDB logistical support. \n \n21.  A consulting team led by an international firm and comprising international and national \nexperts will be engaged for project management and capacity strengthening. All procurement \nand consultant recruitment to be financed under the ADB loan, including ADB-administered \ncofinancing, will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as \n                                                \n14 ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Bangladesh (footnote 11) indicates that ADB finances taxes and duties if do \nnot constitute an excessively high share of the project cost. The share of the taxes and duties against the total \nproject cost for the additional financing is not significant, and the taxes and duties apply only to ADB-financed \nexpenditures. The financing of taxes and duties contributes to the efficiency of financial management throughout \nthe project period. The Government of Bangladesh will finance the entire land acquisition costs, and the ADB loan \nproceeds will pay only for resettlement compensation. \n15 This additional financing from the Government of the Netherlands amounting to $7.0 million represents more than \n15% of the original loan and grant amount combined. \n ", "6 \namended from time to time) and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from \ntime to time).

They will be achieved through reduced flooding, \ntimely  drainage  and  water  retention  through  renovated  infrastructure,  improved  water \nmanagement, and beneficiary capacity development. The economic analysis was carried out for \neach subproject and for the entire additional scope of the project. The economic internal rate of \nreturn for each subproject area ranges between 16.3% and 26.2%, and for the entire project it is \n19.6%. The sensitivity tests and risk analysis confirm that the subprojects are  consistently \nrobust. The project will remain economically viable under all sensitivity test scenarios. There will \nalso be nonquantifiable and intangible benefits as a result of training and institutional capacity \ndevelopment of local people, such as women\u2019s participation in community activities, longer-term \nintegrity of the infrastructure, and awareness raising of water users in efficient water use and the \nimportance  of  collective  actions  for  their  livelihood  improvements.  The  project  will  also \nsubstantially benefit poor people, with a poverty impact ratio of 58%. \n \n24.  The project supports the establishment of the annual O&M fund collection system for \nWMOs. The O&M fund collection system will also be built into the income-generating activities \nof WMOs. The fund will cover the costs of minor O&M to be undertaken by WMOs, while \nBWDB\u2019s revenue budget will cover major O&M costs, such as replacement of gates. Capacity \ndevelopment programs will be designed to ensure financial sustainability of WMOs. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n25.  The financial and procurement management capacity of BWDB was assessed in 2015 \n(footnote 17) and confirmed to be generally sound. The government\u2019s midterm review and the \nperformance assessment of the current project concluded that BWDB\u2019s institutional capacity as \nthe executing agency is satisfactory (footnote 7). The government\u2019s draft project completion \nreport of the current project reached the same conclusion, and assessed that the current project \nhas contributed to strengthened capacity of BWDB. The overall risk is rated moderate. The \nproject has set clear input and output targets to ensure good governance. Risk management \nmeasures have been identified and incorporated in the project design and risk management \nplan (para. 35). \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and BWDB. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 17). \n \n ", "8 \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n27.  The project will have positive impacts on poverty reduction and food security among the \nsocially  disadvantaged,  including  women.  Despite  recent  good  progress,  Bangladesh\u2019s \neconomic situation remains difficult, with an annual per capita gross national income of $1,010 \n(in 2013) and with 31.5% of its population living below poverty line.18 About 80% of poor people \nreside in rural areas, and most of them are engaged in agriculture, related nonfarm activities, \nand fisheries. Sampling surveys identified that the proportion of the population in the project \narea living below the poverty line is estimated at 41%\u201347%, significantly higher than the national \nfigure. The project will contribute to poverty reduction for about 220,000 people below the \npoverty line by accelerating agricultural and rural growth through efficient water use. \n \n28.  The project will continue to be implemented with high participation of stakeholders in \ndecision making. The empowerment of poor people and women through income-generation and \nlivelihood improvement, and the inclusion of socially disadvantaged groups such as tenant \nfarmers and poor fishers, is built into the project design. The project will provide a more stable \nenvironment  with  improved  water  management  and  strengthened  livelihood  improvement \ncapacity of beneficiaries. The specific strategy includes (i) pro-poor procedures for beneficiary \nselection and employment; (ii) inclusive membership access to WMGs; (iii) participation in \nplanning,  designing,  implementing,  and  monitoring  water  management  structures;  and \n(iv) inclusive capacity development programs for WMG members for water management and \nlivelihood improvement. Employment opportunities for civil works, including minor works by \nlabor  construction  societies  that  include  the  socially  disadvantaged  and  women,  will  also \ncontribute to income generation of local residents. \n \n29.  The project is classified as having a gender equity theme, to sustain and advance the \nprogress made in the current project that demonstrates remarkable empowerment of women. In \naddition  to  the  achievement  of the  number  of female WMO members,  the  current  project \ndemonstrates women\u2019s quality participation with enhanced decision making capacity with WMG \nexecutive committees having an average of 33% women, who hold positions such as vice-\npresident, assistant secretary, and cashier. \n \n30.  The project will empower women through (i) participating in decision making of WMA \nand  WMG  management  committees,  which  should  include  a  minimum  of  33%  women; \n(ii) training in agriculture, livestock, postharvest processing, fisheries production, or other water \nmanagement and livelihood improvement matters depending on the beneficiaries\u2019 practical and \nstrategic needs; and (iii) employment opportunities for community mobilization, construction, \nand O&M activities. Benefits for women are expected to result in respectful relationships and \ndecision-making power within the family. The percentage of women employed in agriculture \nincreased from 59% in 1998 to 66% in 2008, whereas men employed in agriculture decreased \nfrom 83% to 65% during the same period. Women did 48% of agricultural work during 1999\u2013\n2000 and the rate had significantly increased, to 68%, in 2005\u20132006.19 This situation was \nattributed to migration of men from agriculture to nonfarm occupations, resulting in a change in \nthe role of women from unpaid family workers to farm managers (footnote 19).

Safeguards \n \n31.  Environment (category B). An initial environmental examination was prepared to cover \nnine subprojects to be implemented under the additional financing project in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement (2009).  It was  disclosed  on  the ADB  website  with  the \nendorsement of BWDB. Considering the nature of the project and the location, the project \nactivities  are  not  expected to generate  any  significant  adverse  environment  impact  that  is \nirreversible, long term, or cumulative. The subproject areas are not located within or close to \nany  protected  areas  or  ecologically  important  areas.  The  subproject  areas  are  not \nenvironmentally sensitive. Potential environmental impacts will occur mainly during construction, \nsuch as dust and sediment pollution of water, and are temporary and reversible. Mitigation \nmeasures have been incorporated into the environmental management and monitoring plan. \nThe potential environmental impacts related to the operation of structures are not expected to \nbe significant, because the project will renovate existing structures, except 1.5 kilometers (km) \nof a new embankment that is replacing a breached portion of an existing embankment system. \nStakeholders  to  be  affected  have  been  consulted,  and  an  existing  grievance  redress \nmechanism under the current project will be continued. The current project has been complying \nwith environmental safeguard requirements. BWDB has demonstrated adequate capacity to \nimplement and monitor the environmental management plan but has to ensure that adequate \nstaff is available for implementation and monitoring. \n \n32.  The climate risk and vulnerability assessment rated the climate risk of the project as \nmedium. Adaptation measures responding to address this risk have been built into the project \ndesign. Resilience of the water uses against potential climate change will be enhanced through \ncapacity development of WMOs for appropriate operation of gates and improved water use \nefficiency. \n \n33.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). The rehabilitation and construction works will \nbe located within the right-of-way of existing structures or in locations where no land acquisition \nis involved. The new 1.5 km embankment requires 2.74 ha of land acquisition consisting of 49 \nplots. This land acquisition will affect 55 households, of which 45 households comprising 183 \npeople will lose 10% or more of their productive land. No structure will be affected, and no \nhousehold will be physically displaced. The resettlement plan for the new embankment was \nprepared in accordance with the government\u2019s laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement, and was disclosed on the ADB website. Precise locations of the rehabilitation \nand resectioning of existing embankments and other structures will be determined during the \nadditional financing project through the beneficiary participatory planning. The locations will be \nselected  to  avoid  involuntary  resettlement  but  there  remains  a  possibility  that  involuntary \nresettlement  will  be  unavoidable.  As  a  prudent  measure,  a  resettlement  framework  was \nprepared,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  should  any  involuntary \nresettlement issue arise. BWDB has demonstrated its capacity to implement resettlement plans \nunder  the  current  project  and  to  comply  with  the  safeguard  requirements  for  involuntary \nresettlement. \n \n34.  Indigenous peoples (category C). There are no indigenous peoples as defined for \noperational purposes by ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement in the project area. \n \n \n ", "10 \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n35.  The project has a medium overall rating of potential risks. Major risks and mitigating \nmeasures  are  described  in  detail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.20 A \npotential shortage of BWDB O&M funds was found to be a high risk, and the overall project was \ndesigned  to  mitigate  the  risk.  Local  water  users  are  trained  in  routine  O&M  to  minimize \ndeterioration of structures and are involved in major O&M to be conducted by BWDB. Specific \nloan  covenants  are  included  to  ensure  that  the  government  provides  adequate  budget  to \nBWDB. Mitigation measures for other potential medium-to-low risks have been taken during the \nimplementation of the current project and are also built into the project design of the additional \nfinancing. The integrated benefits and impacts of the project are expected to overweigh the \npotential costs from the risks. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n36.  The government and BWDB have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. The government and BWDB have agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement, grant agreement, and \nproject agreement. \n \nV.
