INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Mongolia requested support from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to increase the availability of affordable and good-quality medicines through optimizing \nthe procurement of medicines in public hospitals and promoting a public supply system. A fact-\nfinding mission took place in Ulaanbaatar in May 2015. ADB subsequently reached agreement \nwith  the  government  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  cost  and  financing,  implementation \narrangements, and outline terms of reference for consulting services for the technical assistance \n(TA). Concept clearance was obtained on 2 July 2015. The design and monitoring framework is \nin Appendix 1.1 \nII.  ISSUES  \n2.  High out-of-pocket expenses are one of the biggest development issues in Mongolia, \naccounting for 41% of total health expenditure. One third of households\u2019 out-of-pocket spending \non health goes to medicines. This indicator is higher for low- and middle-income families.2  \n3.  The current pharmaceutical supply system for public health services in Mongolia is fully \ndecentralized. Every hospital, including public hospitals, directly purchases its medicines from \nprivate suppliers, and establishes the price of each item. Suppliers deliver medicines directly to \nthe hospitals. Public hospitals (accounting for 82.5% of outpatient consultations and 78% of \ninpatient hospitalizations countrywide) mostly use an open-tender method under the Public \nProcurement Law. However, because of the small size of procurements, hospitals cannot attract \nenough  competitive  suppliers  to  enable  them  to  negotiate  prices.  Public  hospitals  provide \nmedicines to inpatients only which are either subsidized by the government or funded from \nsocial  health  insurance.  Cost  of  medicine  prescribed  by  doctors  to  outpatients  is  partially \nreimbursed for selected items from the social health insurance if patient has health insurance \ncoverage;  however  access  to  the  subsidized  medicines  is  very  limited.3 Because  of  low \navailability and access to subsidized medicines for outpatients people buy medicines without \nprescription  directly  from  pharmacies.  There  are  no  government  owned  pharmaceutical \nwholesale companies and no public pharmacies; only private pharmacies and retail drug outlets \nor in rural soums (administrative subunits of a province) \u201crevolving drug funds\u201d operated by \nprivate pharmacists4 serve people with medicines. \n4.  The main features of the current system are the high cost and low quality of medicines, \nand irrational use of medicines, with extensive use of non-essential medicines and expensive \nbrands. One third (29%) of medicines in the market are substandard, illegal or counterfeit.5 \nAvailability of essential medicines is low (42.8%\u201360%) in public hospitals, as well as in retail \npharmacies. Consumer prices for medicines are among the highest in Asia\u20142.25 to 5.53 times \n                                                \n1 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 August 2015.  \n2 Government of Mongolia, National Statistical Office. 2013. Household Socioeconomic Survey. Ulaanbaatar.  \n3 Under the Drug Discount Program the Social health insurance fund partially (up to 50%) reimburses the cost of \nselected medicines. The Drug Discount Program consumes only 2% of the total health insurance fund expenditure \nannually.    \n4 Revolving  funds  were  set-up  with  seed  funding  provided  by  the  government  and  are  operated  by  private \npharmacists. \n5 Government of Mongolia, Ministry of Health. 2013.

Cumulative wholesale and retail mark-ups range from \n37.5% to 115%; average add-on costs account for 30.4% of the final price.6 \n5.  Drug regulatory functions are fragmented and undertaken by different agencies, which \nmakes coordination difficult and creates inefficiencies. Mongolia is one of the very few countries \nwithout a national regulatory agency with medicine control under one management structure, \nusing one quality control system and one single information system. The pharmaceutical market \nrelies heavily on imported medicines; only 20-30% of the domestic market is supplied by local \ndrug  manufacturers,  but  most  of  them  do  not  comply  with  good  manufacturing  practices. \nMedicine registration, licensing, import/export control, inspection and laboratory capacity have \nbeen significantly upgraded over the last five years. In order to ensure the quality and safety of \ndrugs,  for  the  entire  population,  an  effective  system  for  coordinating  and  managing  both \nimported  and  domestically  produced  drugs,  is  essential.    It  is  also  be  vital  for  ensuring \ncompliance with international standards for locally-produced drugs.  \n6.  ADB  supported  the  government  in  mitigating  the  impact  of  the  financial  crisis  of \n2008/2009 by providing free health services, including medications, to the poor from 2009 to \n2014 under a Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction grant project.7 The project addressed the gaps \nin coverage and benefits of the health insurance system. The revised Social Health Insurance \nLaw (2015) ensured full coverage for the poor and expanded significantly the benefits package. \nADB has also supported strengthening the drug safety regime under the drug safety component \nof the Fourth Health Sector Development Project. 8 Major achievements of the project are (i) a \nrevised National Medicines Policy (2014); (ii) improved medicines regulatory functions through \nthe establishment of a national medicines regulatory unit; (iii) an upgraded national reference \nlaboratory  for  drug  quality  control  following  international  standards;  (iv)  revised  technical \nstandards for medicines manufacturing and distribution, as well as for pharmacy practices; and \n(v) improved government capacity in inspecting, monitoring, and coordinating medicines-related \nregulatory  functions.  However,  policy  agendas  initiated  under  the  project,  such  as  the \nestablishment of a government medicines regulatory agency and consolidation of all regulatory \nfunctions,  are  only  partially  achieved.  Issues  to  be  addressed  include  the  high  cost  of \nmedicines, their irrational use, and the low quality and limited availability of medicines. These \nrequire additional technical and financial assistance to continue the policy dialogue and build \nfurther on the momentum established under ADB-supported projects.   \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact of the TA will be reduced household health expenditure, especially among \nthe poor, increased efficiency of the medicines procurement and supply system and increased \naccess to essential medicines. The outcome will be increased availability of affordable and \ngood-quality generic medicines in public hospitals. \n                                                \n6 Government  of  Mongolia,  Ministry  of  Health.  2013.

Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  To increase the availability of affordable and good quality medicines in public hospitals, \nthe TA will support optimization of the medicines procurement system for public hospitals. It will \nassist  in  (i)  introducing  cost-efficient  and  effective  pooled  procurement  system  of  generic \nmedicines from reputable suppliers for public hospitals,9 (ii) reorganization of public hospital \npharmacies to supply medicines to outpatients, and (iii) strengthening regulatory supervision of \nmedicines.  \n9.  Key activities of the TA will be organized under three outputs: \nOutput 1: Introducing cost-efficient and effective medicine procurement systems \nfor public hospitals. This output will include (a) a comprehensive assessment of the \nsector,  including  analysis  of  the  current  regulatory  framework  for  procurement  of \nmedicines,  the  pharmaceutical  supply  management  system,  a  review  of  best \ninternational practices, and market analysis; (b) designing the new procurement system \nfor  group  contracting  of  good  quality  generic  medicines  for  public  hospitals  and \ndeveloping  secondary  legislation,  master  bidding  documents,  and  practical  tools  to \nimplement the new system; (c) piloting the new system, and monitoring and evaluation \nof the pilot; and (d) developing policy recommendations based on the results of the pilot. \nThe output will also ensure institutional and human capacity development to strengthen \nkey functions and technical skills of staff at the Ministry of Health and Sports (MOHS), \nthe Ministry of Finance, and the Government Procurement Agency through on-the-job \ntraining, overseas study tours, and capacity-building activities on the development of \nessential medicines  lists, selection  of medicines for  bulk contracting,  preparation of \nbidding  documents,  bid  evaluation  and  the  contracting,  selection  and  monitoring  of \nsuppliers,  and quality  assurance. The  pooled procurement  system  will  increase  the \npurchasing capacity of public hospitals and help decrease the hidden costs of medicines \ncaused by importers\u2019 margins and wholesalers\u2019 add-ups and increase availability of low-\ncost and good quality generic  medicines from trustworthy sources in public hospitals. \nOutput 2: Reorganizing hospital pharmacies in the public sector. This output will \nfocus  on  reorganizing  pharmacies  in  public  hospitals  to  supply  low-cost  generic \nmedicines\u2014obtained through pooled procurement mechanisms\u2014to ambulatory patients. \nThe public hospitals will be granted the right to sell medicines to outpatients, which will \nincrease access to low-cost generic medicines  and will indirectly lead to a decrease in \nthe market price of essential medicines as it will serve as a benchmark for the private \nsector. The output will involve a regulatory framework and operational manuals. The \noutput will also include a study of international experience on how to prevent provider-\ninduced  demand  and  how  to  implement  mechanisms  for  cost  controls,  as  well  as \nincentives to promote standard treatments by providers. Mechanisms to handle patient \ncomplaints and grievance will be introduced.  \nOutput 3: Strengthening medicine regulatory functions. This output will focus on \nfurther strengthening the drug regulatory functions of the MOHS based on achievements \nof the Fourth Health Sector Development Project, and improving public awareness on \nrational use of medicines. This will include (a) developing a medicine pricing policy and \n                                                \n9 Pooled procurement or group procurement is when purchasing is done by one procurement office on behalf of \ngroup facilities, health systems, or countries, and when group members agree to purchase certain medicines \nexclusively through the group. \n \n ", "4  \nsystem for monitoring prices, affordability, and availability; (b) introducing an effective \ndrug  safety  monitoring  system;  and  (c)  developing  and  implementing  a  public \ncommunications  strategy  to  promote  awareness  on  the  rational  use  of  medicines. \nImportant studies on the quality and availability of medicines, as well as pricing will be \ncarried out to support decision making and good governance.  \n10.  The  TA  is  based  on  the  assumption  that  the  government  will  continue  to  pursue \noptimization of the health service delivery system and implement interventions to decrease the \nfinancial burden of high out-of-pocket expenses for health services, including medicines. It also \nassumes that the government will continue to further strengthen the public procurement system. \n11.  The primary risk would be possible weakened political will due to resistance from private \nproviders dominating the pharmaceutical sector. The implementation of the project can also be \ndelayed  because  of  parliamentary  elections  in  2016  and  possible  changes  in  government \npriorities.       \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,100,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of office accommodation, venues for meetings, counterpart staff \nand allowances, and other in-kind contributions.  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The MOHS will be the executing agency for the TA. The TA will use a participatory \nconsultative approach, working closely with, and reporting to, designated focal points of the \nMinistry of Finance and the Government Procurement Agency. Active involvement of both these \noffices is important for the harmonization of laws, regulations, and operational processes related \nto procurement processes, local preference issues, and financial and payment mechanisms. \nCivil society, the private sector, and international development partners will be involved during \nTA implementation. The TA will be implemented over 36 months from 1 October 2015 to 31 \nOctober 2018.  \n14.  The TA will engage 44 person-months of consulting expertise (22 person-months of \ninternational  consultants  and  22  person-months  of  national  consultants)  specialized  in \nmedicines  and  public  procurement  systems,  medicines  supply,  and  medicines  regulatory \nfunctions. A consulting firm will be recruited through quality and cost-based selection method \nwith quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10. The MOHS will establish a project implementation unit (PIU) to \nmanage day-to-day activities of the project. The PIU will comprise a health-specialist  and \nproject  coordinator  (36  person-months)  and  an  administrative  and  finance  coordinator  (36 \nperson-months).  The  two  project  coordinators  will  be  recruited  as  individual  consultants. \nConsultants and project coordinators will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The outline terms \nof reference for consultants and project coordinators are in Appendix 3. \n15.  The project coordinator will be responsible for procuring office equipment for the PIU \nunder  the  supervision  of  the  executing  agency  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  executing  agency  will  retain  the \nequipment upon completion of TA activities. \n ", "  5\n16.  The  proceeds  of the TA  will  be  disbursed  in line  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). To facilitate implementation, \nADB may establish an advance payment facility for the executing agency to support certain \nagreed  cash  expenditures,  including  workshops,  training,  seminars  and  conferences,  and \nproject  administrative  expenses,  with  details  of  the  proposed  activities  and  cost  estimates \nsubmitted by the executing agency to ADB for prior approval. ADB may also make certain direct \npayments. \n17.  Annual seminars will be held with representatives of the government, media, and civil \nsociety to discuss progress, achievements, and issues. Dissemination of TA achievements will \nbe ensured through workshops, policy debates, printed information and educational materials, \nthe media, and public-awareness-raising campaigns. A final conference will be held with broad \nparticipation of public and private sectors, beneficiaries, and civil society to present and discuss \nstudy results and project achievements.       \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Mongolia for Improving Access to Affordable Medicines in Public Hospitals, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the Project Is Aligned with: \n1.
