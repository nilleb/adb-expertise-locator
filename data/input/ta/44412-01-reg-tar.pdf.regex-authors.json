INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Independent Evaluation Department (IED)1 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \ndevelops its 3-year evaluation program in consultation with ADB\u2019s Development Effectiveness \nCommittee of the Board of Directors, Management, and operations departments. The research \nand development technical assistance (TA) will be used to support the following activities in \nIED's 2011 work program:2 (i) three special evaluation studies assessing ADB support for \ndeveloping an enabling environment for the private sector, ADB support for promoting good \ngovernance in the Pacific developing member countries (Pacific DMCs), and ADB experience in \nadopting the managing for development results (MfDR) agenda; (ii) an impact evaluation of the \nreformed  vocational  and  technical  education  (TVE)  system  in  Viet  Nam;  (iii)  a  real-time \nevaluation of ADB\u2019s response to the global economic crisis; and (iv) an information brief on \ngood  practices  to  be  considered  for  project  designs  with  multiple  components,  executing \nagencies, and locations. Such multicountry and multisector evaluation activities\u2014which are \ngeared to improve development effectiveness in DMCs\u2014have benefited from the use of ADB \nTA resources, which are responsive in providing needed inputs. The TA will also (i) support \nactivities of the Evaluation Cooperation Group (ECG)3 and (ii) contribute to regional centers for \nthe development of monitoring and evaluation capacity in East Asia and South Asia. This is the \nsecond of two TA projects planned for 2010.4 The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  20205  results  framework,  and  its  annual  review6  have  brought \ndevelopment effectiveness to the core of ADB operations. This TA helps IED provide evaluative \nfeedback on the effectiveness of ADB operations in six important areas. \n \n3.  Developing an enabling environment for private sector development.  ADB\u2019s 2000 \nPrivate Sector Development Strategy7 seeks to use ADB\u2019s public and private sector operations \nto  enable  private  sector  growth  in  the  DMCs  and  to  reduce  poverty.  ADB\u2019s  public  sector \noperations strategy has two thrusts: (i) to support DMC governments to create (a) supportive \nconditions for business through related policy, regulatory, and institutional reforms of product, \nfinancial,  labor,  and  land  markets;  (b)  conducive  macroeconomic,  tax,  competition,  trade, \ninvestment, and education policies; (c) relevant public sector management, customs, business \nregistration,  and  legal  system  reforms;  (d)  improved  private  sector  access  to  finance  and \nbusiness development services; and (e) the promotion of private sector participation in the \ndevelopment of infrastructure; and (ii) to generate business opportunities in ADB-financed public \nsector  projects  through  support  for  public\u2013private  partnerships  and  privatization  programs. \nStrategy  2020  assumes  that  by  2020,  50%  of  ADB  operations  will  support  private  sector \n                                                \n1  IED was named the Operations Evaluation Department (OED) until December 2008. \n2  IED\u2019s 2011 work program is built on its 2011\u25002013 work program approved by the ADB Board of Directors on 7 \nDecember 2010. The IED work program is available at http://www.adb.org/evaluation/about/workprograms.asp \n3  ECG  comprises  the  evaluation  offices  in  ADB,  the  African  Development  Bank,  the  European  Bank  for \nReconstruction and Development, the European Investment Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the \nInternational Monetary Fund, and the World Bank Group. ADB will chair the ECG in 2011/2012 and host the 2011 \nmeetings in Manila. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 3 November 2010.  \n5  ADB. 2008.

The study will seek to answer the following questions: (i) How has ADB \ncontributed to PSD in Asia and the Pacific in particular the creation of an enabling environment? \n(ii) How successful was this assistance, what approaches have worked, which ones did not, and \nwhy? (iii) How can ADB support for PSD be strengthened in line with Strategy 2020 objectives? \n \n4.  Promoting good governance in Pacific developing member countries. In ADB\u2019s \nPacific Approach 2010\u20132014,8 Pacific DMCs are categorized into three broad groups according \nto their potential for economic growth and level of governance: (i) those that demonstrate \ncapacity for self-sustained growth, partly resulting from good governance; (ii) those that rely on \nnatural resource endowments as sources of growth, yet struggle to diversify their economies; \nand  (iii)  those  that  struggle  to  attain  self-sustaining  growth,  yet  have  external  sources  of \nassistance that support their economies. The study aims to examine ADB\u2019s experience in \npromoting good governance and to learn lessons from each of these country groupings; with a \nfocus on ADB support for public financial management that directly supports country service \ndelivery mechanisms. \n \n5.  Implementing managing for development results. In 2004, ADB adopted the MfDR \nreform agenda to enhance the development effectiveness of its operations and subsequently \nrevised its action plan for MfDR in 2006.9 IED\u2019s preliminary evaluation of implementation of the \nMfDR agenda in ADB showed (i) progress made was comparable to that of other multilateral \ndevelopment banks, and (ii) ADB should increase its efforts to adopt the MfDR agenda.10 The \nproposed study will, among others, seek to answer the following questions: (i) What has been \nADB\u2019s  progress  in  strengthening  its  capacity  to  undertake  results-based  approaches  for \ncountries,  sectors,  and  projects?  (ii)  What  has  been  ADB\u2019s  progress  in  improving  results \nmonitoring and reporting in operations (including for sectorwide operations, such as public \nfinancial management)? (iii) How far has ADB progressed in implementing the MfDR agenda \ncompared with other multilateral development banks? and (iv) What improvements have been \nput  in  place  to  improve  managerial  practices  and  incentives  for  MfDR  since  IED\u2019s  2007 \nevaluation?  \n \n6.  Increasing  the  impact  of  vocational  and  technical  education.  ADB  provided \nassistance of $54 million to Viet Nam to reform the TVE system to (i) improve its market \norientation, (ii) improve efficiency of the TVE program, and (iii) strengthen institutional capacity \nof the General Department of Vocational Training to implement TVE reform.11 The project \ncompletion report rates the project successful and states that the project (i) reduced poverty and \naddressed social issues in skill training by enhancing access to selected key schools for women \nand ethnic minorities, and (ii) improved equitable access to skills training opportunities. The \nstudy will provide quantitative and qualitative estimates of realized outcomes and impacts, and \ntheir sustainability. It will use a quasi-experimental research design using data-appropriate \nestimation methods. \n \n7.  Evaluating ADB\u2019s response to impacts of the global financial crisis on Asia. The \nevaluation will provide real-time feedback to ADB on the relevance, efficiency, and effectiveness \nof  its  crisis  response  assistance. The  assessment  will  take  into  account  the  purpose  and \nobjectives of ADB\u2019s crisis response policy, the channels of transmission of the crisis to different \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2009.

The \nevaluation will also look at the strategic positioning, partnerships, and coordination with other \ndevelopment partners; timeliness of assistance; and suitability of instruments used. It will cover \nADB\u2019s crisis-related loans and grants approved in 2009, including the trade finance facilitation \nprogram. \n \n8.  Considering good practices when designing projects with multiple components, \nand multiple executing and/or implementing agencies. Certain sectors are compelled to \nadopt  complex  project  designs  with  multiple  components  and  multiple  executing  and/or \nimplementing  agencies  because  of  the  multidisciplinary  nature  of  development  assistance. \nHowever,  based  on  experience,  projects  that  have  these  characteristics  are  difficult  to \nimplement and are prone to less than satisfactory performance. The objective is to suggest, \nbased on evidence, practical tips, project formulation tools, and points to avoid in order to \nachieve greater success in multisector, multiagency, and multilocation projects.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact of the TA is improved development effectiveness of ADB operations and \npolicies through learning from evaluation findings. The outcomes of the TA are (i) improved \nformulation  and  implementation  of  ADB  country  and  sector  strategies,  and  policies;  and  \n(ii) better design of public and private sector operations based on IED evaluation findings, \nlessons, and recommendations.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  An evaluation approach paper detailing the scope, methodology, resource requirements, \nconsultants\u2019  terms  of  reference,  and  dissemination  plan  will  be  prepared  for  each  of  the \nevaluation studies under this TA before the studies begin.  \n \n11.  Special  evaluation  study  on  ADB  assistance  for  an  enabling  environment  for \nprivate sector development. The study will assess (i) ADB\u2019s strategic approach to supporting \nPSD and the relative importance of direct and indirect assistance mechanisms; and (ii) the \ndevelopment effectiveness of projects seeking to strengthen the enabling environment for the \nprivate sector based on (a) an analysis of (self)evaluation reports and project documents;  \n(b) interviews with relevant ADB staff; (c) in-depth studies of a sample of relevant programs \nsupported by ADB; (d) a review of ADB project databases; and (e) a review of other relevant \ninformation from various sources on DMC PSD, in particular, private sector contributions to \neconomic development, private sector investment trends, investment climate issues, and the \ndevelopment  of  doing business  indicators. The  study  will  identify  lessons for  the  strategic \npositioning and design of future ADB assistance for PSD. \n \n12.  Special  evaluation  study  on  ADB  support  for  promoting  good  governance  in \nPacific developing member countries. The study will (i) evaluate ADB support from 2000 to \n2010 to promote good governance in Pacific DMCs; (ii) review past ADB governance-related \ninterventions in all sectors, and the effects of these interventions on individual projects and \n ", "4 \nprograms;12 and (iii) identify possible areas for future ADB support. In particular, the study will \nexamine  the  impact  of  ADB  loan  and  TA  support  to  governance-related  areas  including  \n(i)  public  financial  management  and  public  administration  reforms,  (ii)  service  delivery,  \n(iii)  institutional  and  capacity  development,  (iv)  aid  coordination,  and  (v)  an  enabling \nenvironment for PSD. The study will be based on desk reviews and field visits to include \nextensive consultations with DMC governments and key development partners. It will cover \nloans and TA projects directly related to good governance and the good governance promotion \nelements of loans and TA projects from other sectors, including those covered under the public \nsector reform evaluation and the proposed transport sector study. \n \n13.  Special  evaluation  study  on  managing  for  development  results.  The  study  will \nindependently evaluate and draw lessons from ADB\u2019s experience in adopting the MfDR agenda. \nThe study will cover the three MfDR pillars: (i) support DMC capacity to manage for results,  \n(ii) enhance ADB\u2019s results orientation and institutional effectiveness, and (iii) support MfDR \nknowledge sharing and harmonization efforts globally. The study will be based on (i) a review of \nexisting documents related to MfDR, (ii) surveys and/or interviews with MfDR stakeholders \n(including DMC officials, development partners, and ADB staff), (iii) assessment of compliance \nwith MfDR requirements, and (iv) assessment of ADB progress to date in adopting MfDR.  \n \n14.  Impact evaluation on vocational and technical education. The study will build on the \nfour rounds of labor market surveys conducted during the project, and address impact and \nsustainability issues of vocational education and training in Viet Nam. Based on the coverage \nand quality of baseline data collected for the project, impact evaluation will use before and after, \nas well as with and without project interventions. The feasibility of panel data analysis and a \ntracer study will be explored, subject to access to raw data collected during the four rounds of \nmarket surveys. The study will primarily focus on economic and social impacts of vocational \neducation and training on general beneficiaries and disadvantaged groups, including ethnic \nminorities  and women. It will adopt a mixed  method approach combining quantitative and \nqualitative techniques. The sustainability analysis will involve a visual inspection of physical \nfacilities, mechanisms in place for sustaining their operations and maintenance, stability of \ntrainers or teaching staff, and evidence supporting continuation of policy reforms introduced \nduring  project  implementation.  Data  analysis  will  be  conducted  using  data-appropriate \nquantitative and qualitative estimation procedures.  \n \n15.  Impact  of  the  global  financial  crisis  on  Asia:  Real-time  evaluation  of  ADB\u2019s \nresponse. The evaluation will use a combination of methods. It will be based on (i) a careful \nreview  of  documents  relating  to  country  macroeconomic  circumstances  and  policies,  ADB \nprograms, program monitoring and/or review reports, and related literature; (ii) structured and \nsemistructured  interviews  with  key  informants  in  the  government,  ADB,  and  development \npartners; (iii) field visits and in-country consultation in selected countries; and (iv) analysis of the \nmost  recent  policies  and  data  on  key  macroeconomic  and  fiscal  variables.  ADB\u2019s  crisis \nresponse  support  will  be  studied  in-depth  in  four  DMCs.  The  evaluation  will  assess  the \nprograms\u2019 progress in fulfilling the objectives for crisis support loans using IED evaluation \ncriteria.  \n16.  Evaluation information brief on good practices for project designs with multiple \ncomponents,  and  multiple  executing  and/or  implementing  agencies. The  study  will  (i) \nreview the validity of a perception that multicomponent projects are prone to lower performance \n                                                \n12  Including those identified in a closely related study on ADB support for transport in Pacific DMCs, and a recent \nstudy on ADB support for public sector reforms (ADB. 2009. Special Evaluation Study on ADB Support for Public \nSector Reforms in the Pacific: Enhance Results through Ownership, Capacity, and Continuity. Manila).  \n ", "5 \nthan single-component, agency, and/or location projects; (ii) find common weaknesses (e.g., \nscope change, project delay, unmet covenants) of projects with multiple components, agencies, \nand/or locations; (iii) list multicomponent projects that have succeeded, and assess the factors \ncontributing  to  their  success  based  on  in-depth  discussions  with  involved  ADB  staff  and \ngovernment counterparts. The study will cover key sectors (two to three) that have a high \ntendency to take up multicomponent projects (the actual sectors will be selected after careful \nproject data screening). The study will endeavor to select one country from each region and \ncover projects approved since 1998. \n \n17.  Support to the Evaluation Cooperation Group. This component covers (i) activities \nconnected with ADB\u2019s term as the ECG chair, and (ii) development of good-practice standards. \nThe TA will support ADB\u2019s contribution to the multidevelopment partner program\u2014the Regional \nCenters for Learning on Evaluation and Results (CLEAR).13 ADB's contribution will be used for \nmonitoring and evaluation-related activities in two centers located in Asia\u2014one in East Asia and \nthe other in South Asia. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $1,102,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis \nby  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  for  $520,000  (TASF\u2013IV),  and  for  $582,000 \n(TASF\u2013other sources). The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. IED will implement the TA and supervise \nall planned studies. The planned studies will require about 21 person-months of international \nand  about  39  person-months  of  national  consulting  services.  The  terms  of  reference  are \noutlined in Appendix 3. Detailed terms of reference for each study will be developed in the \nevaluation approach paper. ADB will engage consultants on an individual basis in accordance \nwith ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). \nDisbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  ADB  will  enter  into  an \nagreement with the World Bank for the implementation of the CLEAR component. The TA \noutputs will be disseminated in accordance with IED knowledge management policies. The TA \nis scheduled to start in December 2010 and be completed in December 2012. Implementation \narrangements will be flexible enough to allow changes should IED\u2019s work program be altered \nincluding, as needed, responding to priorities under Strategy 2020 and the Asian Development \nFund X. ADB will obtain a no-objection from the DMC government prior to commencing any \nactivity financed under this TA in the territory of the DMC concerned. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,102,000 on a grant basis \nfor Selected Evaluation Studies for 2010, Phase 2, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n13  CLEAR\u2019s partners include ADB, the African Development Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the \nDepartment  for  International  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom,  the  Swedish  International  Development \nCooperation Agency, and the World Bank Group.

Special evaluation study on Asian Development Bank assistance for an enabling \nenvironment for private sector development. The terms of reference for consultants will be \ndeveloped during the preparation of the evaluation approach paper. Currently expectations are \nthat international evaluation consultants (about 4 person-months of total inputs) with private \nsector development expertise will be recruited to assess the development effectiveness of \nselected Asian Development Bank (ADB) projects related to the development of an enabling \nenvironment for the private sector. Up to four national consultants (about 4 person-months of \ntotal inputs) will be recruited to (i) provide relevant background information on sector and private \nsector  development,  (ii)  identify  and  collect  information  and  data  to  help  assess  the \ndevelopment effectiveness of selected ADB projects, and (iii) help the independent evaluation \nmission during country visits. \n \n2.  Special  evaluation  study  on  ADB  support  for  promoting  good  governance  in \nPacific developing member countries.
