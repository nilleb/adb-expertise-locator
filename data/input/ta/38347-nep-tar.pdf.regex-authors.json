The Government of Nepal has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for project \npreparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  prepare  the  Information  and  Communications \nTechnology (ICT) Development Project, included in the country strategy and program 2005\u2013\n2009.1 The TA is programmed for ADB\u2019s 2006 TA program for Nepal. The TA Fact-Finding \nMission was carried out in Nepal from 27 to 30 March 2006, and agreement was reached with \nthe Government on the TA\u2019s goal, purpose, scope, implementation arrangements, costs and \nfinancing plan, and outline terms of reference for consulting services.2 A preliminary design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Nepal  is  one  of  the  poorest  countries  in  the  region,  with  about  24  million  people \nscattered throughout remote mountainous areas, a GDP per capita of $270, and a poverty \nincidence of 38%. The geographic isolation and exclusion of the hilly and mountainous areas \nhave been obstacles to inclusive pro-poor development. They hinder connection to markets and \nservices, and access to information and opportunities. The Government recognizes ICT as the \nmost effective means to bring down the country\u2019s geographical barriers, enable information and \nknowledge management, provide new means for service delivery, introduce innovation, and \nthereby  create  opportunities  for  economic  and  social  development.  The  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) include ICT accessibility as a target, as it is important by itself and \ncan help attain other goals such as establishing rural community access points to integrate \nvillages into the information network. The Second World Summit on the Information Society held \nin Tunis in December 2005 thus urged governments to use ICT to create public systems of \ninformation on laws and regulations, expanding public access points and making information \nbroadly available. \n \n3.  To harness the huge potential of ICT, the Government set up the policy direction under \nits first Information Technology (IT) Policy 2000 as well as the revised IT Policy 2005, with an \nintegrated action plan for 2005\u20132007. Following the Telecommunications Act and Policy,3 the \nGovernment has also (i) liberalized the telecommunications sector; (ii) introduced competition \nthrough open licensing; (iii) restructured the former state-owned incumbent provider, Nepal \nTelecom (NT);4 and (iv) promoted private investment. The Nepal Telecommunications Authority \n(NTA) was established in 1998 as an autonomous and corporate body. Amendments to the \nTelecommunications Act have been drafted to strengthen the regulatory environment, including \nNTA\u2019s autonomy, and will be enacted within 2006. The Electronic Transactions Act (2004) \nprovides legal support for the recognition of digital signatures and electronic documents. The \nHigh-Level Commission for Information Technology (HLCIT), which was formed in 2003 and \nchaired by the Prime Minister, oversees national IT policy and strategy and provides strategic \npolicy direction and support to the Government.  \n \n4.  Nevertheless, ICT accessibility, particularly in remote rural areas, is limited, hindering \nbenefits from it, and requires extensive investment. Although NT started mobile services in 1999 \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004. Nepal Country Strategy Program 2005\u20132009. Manila.  \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in April 2006.  \n3  The Telecommunications Act 1997, the Telecommunications Regulations 1997, and the Telecommunications \nPolicy 1999 are the main policies for telecommunications and internet providing legal and policy framework. \n4  It  was  formerly  the  Nepal  Telecommunications  Corporation  (NTC),  which  was  the  incumbent  public \ntelecommunications operator, and monopolized all aspects of telecommunications until the recent entry of private \noperators in the sector. \n ", "2   \nwith the global system for mobile communications (GSM) technology and will deploy a new \ncode division multiple access (CDMA)-2000 network of 1 million lines in a 5-year period, the \noverall level of telephone density for fixed and mobile services is as low as 1.54%, compared \nwith developing countries\u2019 average of 15.5%, the world average of 23.5%, and developed \ncountries\u2019 average of 65.5%.5 Telephone density also varies widely between urban and rural \nareas. Kathmandu, with less than 5.00% of the population, has a telephone density of 18.20%, \nmuch higher the rural areas\u2019 0.06%.  \n \n5.  Nepal's internet market was dramatically boosted in mid-1999, when internet service \nproviders (ISPs) were allowed to have their own international gateways, and the use of very \nsmall aperture terminal (VSAT) was liberalized. The price of internet service fell to $0.2 per hour, \nthe lowest in South Asia. Twenty-six ISPs serve around 200,000 users, of whom about 40,000 \nare  subscribers.  More  than  1,000  internet  access  points  exist  all  over  Nepal,  with  half  in \nKathmandu. The construction of an 880 km fiber optic cable is almost completed along the \neast\u2013west highway with the assistance of the Government of India. Recently Nepal and the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  agreed  to  build  a  115  km  fiber  optic  network  linking \nKathmandu to the border of the PRC (Arniko highway). Internet infrastructure and services, \nalthough greatly improved during the past few years, are still in dire need of expansion and \nenhancement, particularly in remote rural areas. \n \n6.  To bridge the urban\u2013rural digital divide, the tenth 5-year plan (2002\u20132007) targeted \nestablishing telecenters for at least 1,500 village development committees all over the country. \nHowever,  only  about  250  telecenters  are  in  place,  of  which  about  30  are  funded  by  the \nGovernment  and  international  funding  agencies  such  as  the  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme  (UNDP)  and  the  World  Bank;  the  rest  are  sponsored  by  nongovernment \norganizations. The telecenters are an efficient and cost-effective means of providing remote \nrural areas with ICT access and various ICT-enabled services. Telephones, photocopiers, fax \nmachines,  internet  access,  ICT  training,  electronic  government  forms,  and  market  and  job \ninformation can become available to the rural poor. Telecenters also provide offline content on \nhealth,  education,  agriculture,  forestry,  and  social  campaign  programs.  To  speed  up  ICT \naccessibility in the difficult terrain of remote rural areas, the Government should be encouraged \nto establish a telecenter for every VDC as quickly as possible. \n \n7.  Expanded  ICT  accessibility  should  be  complemented  by  suitable  e-services.  The \nGovernment has been pursuing an e-government6 initiative to improve accessibility, efficiency, \nand usability of public service through electronic means. The development of the Government \nportal site,7 which provides links to the websites of all government ministries, departments, and \nagencies, and enables the public to download 32 critical government forms such as citizenship \ncertificate, driver license, and passport application is part of such efforts. Despite the increasing \npresence of e-government, its further development is hindered by obstacles such as (i) poor \nGovernment network and facilities to support the adoption of ICT to improve public services \namong  Government  ministries,  departments,  and  agencies,  and  between  central  and  local \ngovernment;8 (ii) lack of coordination and cooperation in developing information systems among \nministries, departments, and agencies, which limits the efficient use of shared information, \nknowledge, practice, and statistics; (iii) lack of a single-point delivery mechanism for most \n                                                 \n5  International Telecommunications Union. 2006. World Telecommunication/ICT Development Report. Geneva. \n6  It refers to the use of ICT by Government agencies, making their communications and interactions more efficient \nand transparent with citizens, business, and other arms of government. \n7  http://www.nepalhmg.gov.np \n8  To resolve the problem, the Government plans to construct a fiber optics network in central Government offices \nwith the assistance of NT and the World Bank in 2006. \n ", "  3\nGovernment services;9 (iv) lack of ready access to basic information and services; and (v) the \npersistent perception that public services should be provided face-to-face.10 \n \n8.  Recognizing the importance of a concerted and collective approach to improving ICT \naccessibility and pursuing e-government, the Government is developing a master plan that will \nguide investments in e-government.11  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA aims to help the Government prepare an investment project that will support \neconomic  growth  and  reduce  poverty,  including  in  remote  rural  areas,  by  improving  ICT \naccessibility and developing e-government applications in accordance with the road map to be \nidentified by the e-government master plan. The TA will also help improve the legal, regulatory, \nand  institutional  framework  to  expand  ICT  accessibility  and  implement  the  e-government \napplications, as well as develop institutional and human technical capacity in managing ICT \ninfrastructure and operating e-government applications.  \n \n10.  The TA outputs will include (i) an investment plan for improving ICT accessibility in \nremote rural areas; (ii) design of selected e-government applications; (iii) a legal, regulatory, and \ninstitutional  framework  to  expand  ICT  accessibility  and  implement  selected  e-government \napplications; (iv) institutional and human resource development programs; and (v) a feasibility \nassessment of the investment project package.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  Development of an Investment Plan to Improve ICT Accessibility in Remote Rural \nAreas. The TA will examine the ICT sector\u2019s deficiencies in telephone density and internet \naccessibility, infrastructure provision, and sector reform and development. The Government\u2019s \ntelecenter initiative will also be assessed to develop a sustainable telecenter model to be rolled \nout by the ensuing project as well as by the Government\u2019s ongoing telecenter initiative.  \n \n12.  Design of Selected E-Government Applications. The TA will reengineer business \nprocesses to develop e-government applications for selected priority services to be identified by \nthe  master  plan,  and  develop  the  common  architecture  of  applications.  Based  on  the \nreengineering results and the common architecture, the TA will design information systems and \napplications  for  selected  e-government  services,  referring  to  recent  successful  Indian  e-\ngovernment initiatives and considering the lessons from them.  \n \n13.  Development of a Legal, Regulatory, and Institutional Framework, and Human \nResource Development Programs. The TA will (i) assess the existing legal, regulatory, and \ninstitutional  framework;  and  (ii)  identify  areas  for  improvement  so  that  they  support  e-\ngovernment. The TA will develop the strategy, licensing policy, and regulatory framework to \nimprove ICT accessibility in remote rural areas. The TA will also (i) assess the needs for the \n                                                 \n9  Duplicate structures of government at all levels require users to go to several agencies to access even simple \nservices. \n10  This adds substantially to the costs of service delivery as physical connections to Kathmandu and the district \nheadquarters are not good. \n11 The Korean IT Industry Promotion Agency (KIPA) provides TA to develop the master plan, which will be finalized \nby the end of August 2006.  \n ", "4   \nrelated  institutional  and  human  capacity  development,  (ii) develop  and  implement  human \nresource development programs, and (iii) recommend a strategy to enhance organizational \nfunction and structure in training.  \n \n14.  Feasibility Assessment for the Whole Package of ADB-Financed Projects. The TA \nwill formulate an investment project suitable for ADB financing, and carry out the preparatory \nstudies required to examine the feasibility of each project component and to comply with ADB\u2019s \nsafeguard  and  other  policies  and  requirements  for  possible  loan  financing.  These  include \n(i) economic and financial analyses, (ii) a poverty and social assessment, (iii) performance \nmeasurement and monitoring and evaluation system development, (iv) an environmental and \nsocial impact assessment, and (v) an indigenous people\u2019s development plan if required. An \ninitial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $725,000, of which the Government requested ADB to \nfinance $600,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special \nFund contributed by the Government of Japan. The Government will finance the remaining \n$125,000 equivalent to cover the costs of counterpart staff, office accommodation and office \nutilities, office equipment, and local communications. The Government has been informed that \nTA approval does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. Further details of cost \nestimates are in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  HLCIT  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  A  project  management  unit  (PMU)  will  be \nestablished under HLCIT to implement the TA and supervise the consultants. The PMU will be \nheaded by a project director (member secretary, HLCIT) and will consist of the e-government \ntask  force  established  under  the  National  Information  Technology  Centre  and  full-time \nrepresentatives from the Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology; the Ministry of \nInformation and Communications; and NTA. The head of the e-government task force will act as \nproject manager and be responsible for day-to-day TA implementation. The project manager will \nreport to the project director, who will regularly report to HLCIT and ADB about TA progress.  \n \n17.  The consultants will organize workshops to advise all stakeholders of TA progress and \nseek feedback. Under the PMU, a business process reengineering unit will be set up, to be \nheaded by a consultant for reengineering government administrative procedures, and staffed \nwith  full-time  personnel  from  all  ministries  whose  administrative  procedures  are  to  be \nreengineered through the TA. The unit will report to the project manager on reengineering \nprogress. \n \n18.  HLCIT will provide overall guidance to the PMU. HLCIT will review and endorse all the \nconsultants\u2019 recommendations and suggestions to be made as part of the TA outputs. An ADB \nproject specialist, with the aid of the Nepal Resident Mission, will work closely with HLCIT in \nsupervising the consultants and monitoring TA progress. HLCIT will ensure that all ministries \nand agencies concerned are represented in the PMU.  \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over 6 months, from September 2006 to February 2007. \nIndividual international consultants will provide a total of 16 person-months of services, and \nnational consultants 34 person-months, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants.  International  consultants  will  consist  of  (i)  a  team  leader  and  e-government \n ", "  5\nspecialist, (ii) an ICT technical specialist, (iii) an e-center specialist, and (iv) a project economist. \nNational consultants will consist of (i) a public administration specialist, (ii) a reengineering \nspecialist, (iii) an ICT engineer, (iv) a project analyst, (v) a social development and resettlement \nspecialist, (vi) an environment specialist, and (vii) a legal and/or governance specialist. The \noutline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 4.  \n \n20.  The consultants will submit an inception report, which should outline any changes in the \napproach, methodology, or work plan, as well as cost implications for the consultants\u2019 services. \nMonthly progress reports and interim reports will be submitted to ADB and HLCIT so that they \ncan monitor TA progress. After all external and internal human resource development programs \nand workshops, reports evaluating them should be submitted. The reports should summarize \nprogram input, output, and outcomes, and workshop proceedings and achievements. The final \nTA report, including manuals for reengineered administrative procedures for ministries, will be \nsubmitted after reflecting comments on the draft final report from the Government and ADB. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Nepal for preparing the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) \nDevelopment Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6    Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets/Indicators  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact      Assumptions \nICT  made more  Provision of telecenters for all village  Compilation of  Government\u2019s \naccessible to remote  development committees within 5 years  Government statistics  commitment to \nrural areas, and  after project completion     reengineer public \ndelivery of \n  ADB\u2019s TA review  administrative \ngovernment services \nIncrease in access to Government portals  missions  procedures to be \nimproved through the \nby 10% per annum for 5 years after project    suitable for \nICT network  \ncompletion   electronic delivery \n \n  of public services \nIncrease in the ratio of online to over-the-  \ncounter Government services by 10% per  Appropriate \nannum for 5 years after project completion   budgetary support  \n   \nImprovement in the weighted average \ncomposite index of e-readiness in the \nUnited Nations Global E-Government \nReadiness Report to the level of 0.5 within \n5 years after project completion  \nOutcome      Assumptions \nAgreed design for  Identification of project components,  Consultant\u2019s interim  Completion of the e-\nthe loan project,  including their estimated costs, and  and draft final report  government master \nand improved  preliminary assessment of safeguard    plan as scheduled \ncapacity of  compliance issues within 3 months after the Consultant\u2019s report on   \nGovernment staff  TA starts  evaluation of human  Development of a \nto implement e-   resource development  comprehensive and \ngovernment  Finalization of all project features, including  programs   quality e-government \napplications   the scope, cost estimate, financing plan,    master plan \n  implementation arrangements,  ADB TA review   \nimplementation schedule, detailed analysis  missions  \nof safeguard compliance issues, and   \neconomic/financial viability, within 5.5 \nmonths after the TA starts  \n \nTraining of a sufficient number of \nGovernment staff members who will take \ncharge of implementing the project,through \nexternal and internal training programs at \nTA completion  \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
