", " \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Turkmenistan\u2013Afghanistan\u2013Pakistan\u2013India Natural Gas Pipeline (TAPI)1 Project of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) aims to export up to 33 billion cubic meters of natural gas \nper year through a proposed pipeline, approximately 1,800-kilometer long, from Turkmenistan to \nAfghanistan, Pakistan, and India. Project cost was estimated at $7.6 billion in 2008. TAPI will be \noperated by a special purpose consortium company (SPCC) and led by a commercial entity \n(consortium lead). Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India (the parties)2 have the option \nto invest in the SPCC. Design and construction will take about 4 years, after the pipeline \nconsortium lead is selected and consortium agreements are signed. \n \n2.  TAPI  presents  an  opportunity  for  regional  cooperation  on  an  unprecedented  scale, \nlinking the economies of the four countries. The Strategy for Regional Cooperation in the \nEnergy Sector identifies TAPI as one link in the inter-energy relationship among the Central \nAsia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) countries. TAPI\u2019s aims are strategically aligned \nwith  CAREC\u2019s  objectives  of  ensuring (i)  energy  security  through  balanced  development of \nregional infrastructure and institutions, (ii) stronger integration of markets, and (iii) economic \ngrowth through enhanced energy trading. TAPI is a high-priority flagship project in the energy \nsector  under  CAREC  2020.  For  India, the  South  Asia  Regional  Cooperation  Strategy  and \nPrograms, 2011\u20132015 also makes the energy sector a priority. \n \n3.  Despite Turkmenistan\u2019s huge gas reserves, the sixth largest in the world, it only has \naccess to the Russian, Iranian, and Chinese markets. Neighboring gas-scarce countries like \nAfghanistan, Pakistan, and India could be huge potential markets. Afghanistan needs a secure \nenergy source to increase both its capacity to generate electricity and the current electrification \nrate from 20% to 33%.3 Pakistan\u2019s acute power shortage was over 5,000 megawatts in 2011. \nPower disruptions were due to several factors, including depletion of the domestic gas supply, \nincreased competition for gas, and a lack of affordable and reliable alternative energy sources. \nNorthern India experienced a power deficit of approximately 3,000 megawatts in 2011. This \nregional cooperation project will foster economic growth through increased investments and \ntrade, and align the parties\u2019 interests, which will help bring about regional stability and security. \nIncreasing the use of natural gas to generate electricity will reduce damage to the environment, \nas natural gas emits 43% fewer carbon emissions than coal, commonly used in India, for each \nunit of energy delivered.4 \n \n4.  At the parties\u2019 request, ADB has been TAPI\u2019s secretariat since 2002.5 ADB\u2019s role has \nbeen  instrumental  in  facilitating  and  balancing  the  interests  of  the  parties.  TAPI  is  being \nimplemented in four phases. Phase 1 was completed with the signing in December 2010 of the \ngas  pipeline  framework  agreement,  intergovernment  agreement,  and  heads  of  agreement \nrelating to the gas sales and purchase agreement (GSPA). Phase 2 will end with the expected \nsigning  of  the  GSPA  in  2012.  ADB  has  organized  14  ministerial-level  steering  committee \n                                                \n1 The technical assistance (TA) first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 2 May 2012. \n2  \u201cParties\u201d refer to representatives of the governments of Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India. \n3  Afghanistan\u2019s National Development Strategy, Energy Sector 2007/2008\u20132012/2013 aims at a 33% access rate for \nelectricity by 2015. \n4  Cheniere Energy, Inc. LNG Market Fundamentals Global Gas Demand. \n  http://www.cheniere.com/lng_industry/global_gas_demand_shtml \n5  The role of the secretariat involves preparation of studies needed for the governments\u2019 decision-making process, \nand facilitation of negotiations among the parties to secure the necessary agreements to make TAPI a reality. \n ", "2   \nmeetings and 16 technical working group (TWG) meetings thus far.6 ADB also financed several \ntechnical studies and the drafting of agreements.7 The parties have asked ADB to continue as \nsecretariat in phase 3 for the SPCC consortium lead selection, establishing the SPCC, and \nfinalizing GSPA-related operational agreements. The pipeline will be constructed in phase 4. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  TAPI is a mutually beneficial long-term solution for the four countries. With the opening \nup of new markets, landlocked Turkmenistan will be able to diversify its gas exports to the east, \nwhere there is already a tremendous (and growing) demand for energy. Afghanistan, Pakistan, \nand India will gain a steady supply of affordable gas to power their growing economies. TAPI \nwill  go  through  southern  Afghanistan,  providing  job  opportunities  during  construction  and \noperation and an enabling environment for developing industrial capacities in the area. \n \n6.  In view of the project\u2019s size and complexity, it will be essential to select a consortium \nlead that can (i) attract financing, (ii) manage construction, and (iii) reliably operate the pipeline. \nThe potential consortium leads of this caliber that have shown interest thus far indicated such \nprerequisites as: (i) equity investment by representative firms of the government, (ii) on-shore \ngas participation rights in Turkmenistan, and (iii) security arrangements. The parties have not \nyet reached a consensus on how to manage these expectations and need further evidence of \nwhat is actually required. Market and merits/demerit analysis are needed to consider all the \noptions in dealing with and balancing the requirements of potential consortium leads.  \n \n7.  Lessons learned from previous technical assistance (TA) projects showed that: (i) ample \ntime, (ii) strong coordination, (iii) timely monitoring, and (iv) analytical backing for the various \noptions are needed when negotiating among the parties. For example, the negotiations for the \nmodel GSPA took much longer and needed much more background work than anticipated. \nGSPA\u2013related agreements and consortium-related agreements are expected to require the \nsame strategy and care.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.   The  impact  of  the  project  will  be  enhanced  energy  trading  between  Turkmenistan, \nAfghanistan, Pakistan, and India. The project\u2019s outcome is a natural-gas pipeline consortium \nestablished and engaged under a public\u2013private partnership. \n \n                                                \n6 The steering committee consists of petroleum and natural resources ministers and oversees the work of \nthe  TWG.  The  TWG  comprises  representatives  from  domestic  gas  companies,  who  carry  out \nnegotiations. \n7  ADB. 2002.

Methodology and Key Activities \n9.   Stage 1. After the signing of the GSPAs, representatives of the parties and ADB will \nmeet with prospective consortium leads and financiers at road shows to determine the market \nand the conditions under which qualified firms would participate in TAPI. Four road shows will \nbe organized at oil and gas hubs in Asia, Europe, and North America. \n \n10.  The  TA  will  finance  the  cost  of  the  road  shows  (venue,  refreshments,  conference \nequipment, and translation services). An international individual consultant (oil and gas expert) \nwill  be  engaged  to  structure  the  road  shows,  coordinate  the  invitations,  and  ensure  the \nparticipation of suitable prospective private investors. After the road shows, the consultant will \nprepare  a  project  investment  market  study  report  detailing  the  potential  consortium  leads, \nfinanciers,  and  prerequisites  for  participation;  set  out  the  merits  and  demerits;  and  make \nrecommendations for a strategy to attract bidders and promote competition. A legal advisor will \nbe available to answer questions on the GSPA, gas pipeline framework agreement, heads of \nagreement, and intergovernment agreement. Several resource persons will be engaged under \nthe TA to advise on security, safeguards, and commercial, oil, and gas aspects during the road \nshows and subsequent TWGs. ADB will continue to facilitate and organize discussions and \nnegotiations at both TWG and steering committee levels.   \n \n11.   Stage  2.  Subject  to  the  successful  completion  of  stage  1,  the  TA  will  finance  the \nfinalization  of  GSPA\u2013related  agreements,  including  the  operations  agreement  and  network \ncode.8 ADB will continue to facilitate negotiations at both TWG and steering committee levels for \nGSPA-related agreements. ADB will also continue to facilitate discussions at TWG and steering \ncommittee levels until conclusion of the consortium agreement and host country agreements \n(HCAs) and any other pertinent agreements, when requested by the parties. An individual \nconsultant will be recruited under the TA to provide legal advice during these negotiations. Key \nactivities will include organization of at least five TWG meetings and two steering committee \nmeetings between June 2012 and June 2014. \n \n12.  A national consultant will be recruited for stages 1 and 2 to provide: (i) logistical support \nfor the road shows and TWG and steering committee meetings, (ii) analytical support, and (iii) \nTA administrative support at ADB headquarters. \n \n13.  The outputs of the TA will be (i) a project investment market study report, and (ii) signed \nrelevant agreements including the operations agreement, network code, consortium agreement, \nand HCA. The parties will endorse the project investment market study report prepared by the \nconsultant. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.   The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,500,000 equivalent, to be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund under the Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration Financing Partnership Facility.9 Cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n                                                \n8  The operations agreement sets out the contractual obligation of buyers and the seller with regard to operation of \nthe TAPI pipeline (e.g., gas measurements, allocation of gas, dispute resolution, etc). This agreement is closely \nlinked to the GSPA and is required for negotiations of the network code, which is an agreement between the \nbuyers and the pipeline operator. \n9  Established by ADB. The parties will contribute approximately $850,000 equivalent by paying for their staff\u2019s road \nshows and TWG and steering committee meeting expenses. \n ", "4   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.   ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. Disbursement under the TA will be made in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \n16.   The TA will require 16 person-months of international and 24 person-months of national \nconsulting services. Two international individual consultants and 1 national consultant will be \nrequired for this TA. A legal advisor (international consultant), oil and gas expert (international \nconsultant), and coordinator (national consultant) will be engaged as individual consultants. \nIndividual  consultants  are  more  appropriate  and  cost-effective  than  firms  because  of  the \nspecialized skills required for this TA. \n  \n17.  The TA will also require 15 person-days of various resource persons, including experts \nin oil and gas, safeguards, and security, and commercial experts. \n \n18.  Consultants and resource persons will be engaged in accordance with the Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants by ADB and Its Borrowers (2010, as amended from time to time). The \nprocurement of venues and translation services under this TA will be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n19.   The TA will be completed in 25 months, from 1 June 2012 to 30 June 2014. The overall \nresults of the TA will be disseminated in various fora, including through regional cooperation \nmeetings, and energy community of practice. As certain contractual outputs of the TA are \nconfidential, these will not be disseminated. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis \nfor the Turkmenistan\u2013Afghanistan\u2013Pakistan\u2013and India Natural Gas Pipeline Project, Phase 3, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board.

The Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan Project was first conceived in the 1990s. The \nheads of state of Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan met in Islamabad on 30 May 2002 \nand announced their plans to cooperate on implementing the project. As a result of this meeting, \na steering committee comprising energy ministers of the three countries was established. The \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) was designated as the lead development partner following the \nfirst steering committee meeting held in Ashgabat in July 2002. \n \n2.  A framework agreement was signed by the heads of state in August 2002. The draft \nheads  of  agreement,  model  host  country  agreement  (HCA),  model  gas  sales  purchase \nagreement, model gas transportation agreement, and prequalification documents for private \nsector  participation  were  completed.  The  governments  reviewed  only  the  HCA  and  the \nprequalification documents for private sector participation. With ADB\u2019s support, a preliminary \nfeasibility study was prepared in 2003, and an updated study was completed in April 2008. Risk \nmitigation, market, underground storage, and preliminary security studies were also prepared. \n \n3.  In  December  2010,  the  gas  pipeline  framework  agreement  and  intergovernment \nagreement were signed during the heads of state summit in Ashgabat.
