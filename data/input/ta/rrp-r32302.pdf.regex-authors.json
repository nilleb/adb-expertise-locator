These \nachievements are remarkable, as they resulted from public action \nof a democratically elected state government and conscious civil \nsociety.  However,  chronic  and  acute  fiscal  stress  due  to  the \nstate's mounting debt burden over the last decade has severely \nthreatened  these  achievements'  sustainability.  The  recent \nparticipatory poverty assessment carried out in Kerala identified \nfiscal stress as undermining the state's capacity to steer pro-poor \ngrowth. The assessment highlighted some challenges facing the \nKerala government in its mission to eradicate poverty: lack of \neconomic opportunity, weaknesses in targeting programs for the \npoor, and deteriorating health and education quality.  \n  \nThe  Kerala  government  has  formulated  the  Modernizing \nGovernment Program (MGP) and entered into two agreements \nwith  the  central  Government  to  address  the  fiscal  crisis  and \nundertake structural reforms, including in the power sector. The \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  Government  of  the \nNetherlands will provide technical and financial assistance to help \nthe Kerala government implement its reforms.  \n \n  Objectives and  The Program will contribute to the Kerala government's poverty \nScope  reduction and development strategy contained in the Tenth Five-\nYear  Plan  (2002\u20132007)  and  MGP.  The  Program  is  designed \naround four themes and results:  \n(i)  Achieve fiscal sustainability, including initial policy \nactions to enable power sector reform.  \n(ii)  Improve the quality, equity, and value for money of \nservices  provided  by  the  state  government  and \nlocal self-governments (LSGs). \n(iii)  Improve the targeting and quality of the poverty \nreduction programs and social services. \n(iv)  Strengthen the functions and structures of the state \ngovernment and LSGs to increase accountability, \nresponsiveness, transparency, and efficiency. \n ", "ii   \n \nFiscal reform includes the following: \n(i)  creation  of  an  enabling  environment  for  power \nsector reform,  \n(ii)  reform of state-level public enterprises (SLPEs),  \n(iii)  introduction  of  a  medium-term  fiscal  framework \n(MTFF),  \n(iv)  improvement  of  budgeting  and  expenditure \nmanagement, and  \n(v)  strengthening  of  tax  and  nontax  revenue \nmobilization.  \n \nService delivery will focus on design and implementation of an \nintegrated set of policies on service delivery, social audit, and \nasset  renewal.  Poverty  reduction  will  focus  on  strengthening \npoverty monitoring and reporting, improving the quality and the \ntargeting  of  subsidies,  and  designing  and  implementing  an \nantipoverty  sub-plan.  Strengthening  of  state  and  local \ngovernments will facilitate decentralization, redeploy surplus state \ngovernment staff, build institutional and human resource capacity, \nand enact laws to make government information readily available \nto the people of Kerala.  \n \nDeveloped  through  extensive  consultation,  the  Program  is  a \npartnership  among  the  central,  Kerala,  and  Netherlands \ngovernments and ADB. The Program is based on the fiscal reform \ninitiatives contained in the agreements between the central and \nstate governments, and in Kerala's MGP. The partnership has a \ncommon policy matrix and program monitoring arrangement. ADB \nand the Government of the Netherlands have actively participated \nin  the  Kerala  government's  design  process,  and  the  Program \ndraws on the earlier technical assistance (TA) support provided to \nthe  Kerala  government  by  ADB  and  the  Government  of  the \nNetherlands. The design draws on the implementation experience \nand  lessons  learned  from  ADB\u2019s  public  sector  resource \nmanagement and power sector programs in Gujarat and Madhya \nPradesh.  \n \nUnder subprogram 1, policies to achieve the program objectives \nwill be established, with emphasis on implementation, monitoring \nimpact,  and  establishing  accountability  for  the  new  policies. \nImplementation will begin in priority areas and scaled up after \nreview in subprogram 2. During the midterm review of subprogram \n1, criteria will be developed to prioritize projects for subprogram 2. \nThe prior actions to be taken in the power sector should improve \nthe  financial  health  of  the  Kerala  government  and  create  an \nenabling environment for a power sector development program. \nThe  Kerala  government  will  plan  reform  measures  for \nnonoperational manufacturing SLPEs in subprogram 1.  \n \n ", "  iii \n  Poverty  Other \nClassification \n   \n  Thematic  Good governance; human development \nClassification \n   \n  Environmental  Category C \nClassification \n   \nThe Program Loan    \n   \n  Amount and  The Program adopts a cluster approach comprising subprograms \nTerms  1 and 2 totaling $300 million. A loan of $200 million from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources will be provided under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-\nbased lending facility for subprogram 1. The loan will have a 15-\nyear term, including a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee \nof 1.0%, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nLoan Agreement. \n \n  Program Period  The loan for subprogram 1 will be implemented from October 2002 \nand Tranching   to  September  2004.  Subprogram  2  will  be  prepared  after  the \nmidterm review of subprogram 1. The loan for subprogram 2 will be \npresented for consideration and approval by the ADB Board based \non progress in implementing subprogram 1.  \n \nSubprogram  1  will  provide  loan  resources  equivalent  to  $200 \nmillion to be divided into two equal tranches; subprogram 2 will \nprovide loan resources equivalent to $100 million. A parallel grant \nfrom the Government of the Netherlands is proposed to augment \nthe resources of the loan by helping the Kerala government absorb \nthe costs of adjustment under the loan. \n \n  Executing Agency   Kerala's Office of the Chief Secretary and the Finance Department \nwill  be  the  program  executing  agencies.  The  MGP  steering \ncommittee, chaired by the chief secretary will be responsible for \noverall program coordination, implementation, and monitoring. A \nCabinet subcommittee chaired by the chief minister will provide \nstrategic direction and control.   \n \n  Procurement   The proceeds of the loan will be utilized to finance the foreign \nexchange  costs  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items \nproduced in, and procured from, ADB\u2019s member countries, other \nthan those items specified as ineligible and imports financed by \nother bilateral and multilateral sources.  \n \nIn  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program \nLoans, the proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed to India \nas  the  Borrower.

The central Government, however, will certify its compliance \nwith this formula with each withdrawal request. Otherwise, import \ndocumentation under existing procedures will be required. ADB \nreserves the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and verify the \naccuracy of the central Government\u2019s certification. Loan proceeds \nmay be used to finance eligible imports for which expenditures \nwere incurred 180 days before the loan becomes effective.   \n \n  Counterpart  The rupee counterpart funds to be generated out of the loan \nFunds  proceeds  will  be  transferred  by  the  central  to  the  Kerala \ngovernment.  The  counterpart  proceeds  will  be  treated  as  an \naddition to the transfers allocated annually from the central to the \nKerala government. \n \n  Program  Benefits  The Program will enable the Kerala government to build vital \nand Beneficiaries  capacity to identify and discourage wasteful expenditures and to \nredirect resources to program activities with greater social and \neconomic benefits. Subprogram 2 will build upon the reforms and \nstrengthened  institutional  foundation  developed  under \nsubprogram 1. Both subprograms are intended to help the Kerala \ngovernment  enhance  the  state's  social  and  economic \ndevelopment by increasing accountability and pro-poor outcomes, \nimproving service delivery, and fostering sustainability. Although \nsubprogram 1 will bring improvements, significant benefits will be \nrealized after full implementation of subprograms 1 and 2 as many \nof the initiatives will require 2\u20133 years to implement.  \n \nSubprogram 1 will accomplish the following:   \n(i)  Begin to reduce the fiscal deficit and state debt \nburden,  including  off-budget  borrowing,  to \nsustainable levels.  \n(ii)  Account for all liabilities and eliminate off-budget \nborrowing. \n(iii)  Start  restructuring  expenditures  toward  priority \ndevelopment areas. \n(iv)  Enhance resource mobilization by reforming the \nproperty tax and stamp duty, and introducing value-\nadded tax (VAT). \n(v)  Create an environment to improve power sector \noperations  by  establishing  a  regulatory \ncommission.  \n(vi)  Establish an equitable framework for restructuring \npriority manufacturing SLPEs.  \n(vii)  Improve  coordination,  targeting,  and  impact  of \npoverty reduction programs and social safety nets. \n(viii)  Establish sound internal systems of accountability \nfor  service  delivery  results  while  maintaining ", "  v\nfor  service  delivery  results  while  maintaining \nsystems  that  mobilize  public  pressure  for  better \nservices through effective social audits. \n(ix)  Prioritize and target investment for renewing assets \nand introduce effective systems and resources for \nthese  assets'  operation  and  maintenance  to \nimprove service delivery, particularly in the social \nsectors.  \n(x)  Strengthen local financial management capacity by \ninstalling reliable budgetary and control systems for \nlocal government. \n(xi)  Begin restructuring the state government to focus \non core functions and shed tasks that have been \ntransferred to local governments or are no longer \nrequired.  \n(xii)  Introduce simplified and more transparent decision-\nmaking processes. \n(xiii)  Contain staff costs and create a more effective and \nmotivated  workforce  by  implementing  policies  to \nbuild capacity, and redeploy surplus staff. \n(xiv)  Create  an  environment  that  will  give  citizens \ngreater access and rights to information. \n \n  Risks and  Policy and institutional reforms, management  improvement, and \nSafeguards  public  service  reform  are  all  subject  to  considerable  risk. \nConsequently, the Program will have a risk management and \nmitigation strategy built into program management. Risks within \nthe control of the Program include weaknesses in the design, poor \nmanagement  of  implementation,  inadequate  resources  for \nimplementation, and weak capacity. Risks outside the Program, \nwhich  may  be  controllable,  include  sufficiency  of  political \ncommitment  and  agreement,  decision  making  challenges  of \ncoalition  government,  commitment  from  civil  servants, \ninadequately  enforced  legislation,  unresponsiveness  to \ngovernment orders, and a deteriorating fiscal position. Risks that \nare uncontrollable are mainly political, and public action against \nreforms.   \n \nThe program design risks have been addressed by ensuring that \nthe  design  process  involved  lengthy  and  broad-based \nconsultations with the Kerala government over several months. \nThe resulting product reflects the Kerala government\u2019s own reform \nagenda. Second, MGP was subjected to extensive peer review \nand consultations in India and also draws on proposals arising \nfrom TA and national and state expert committee and commission \nreports.  The  cluster  approach  will  allow  subprogram  2  to  be \ndesigned based on the experience of implementing subprogram 1.  \n \nThe biggest risk comes from public action against reform.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a (i) proposed \nprogram cluster concept for the Modernizing Government and Fiscal Reform in Kerala Program \nin India (the Program), (ii) proposed loan to India for subprogram 1 of the Program, and (iii) \nproposed administration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of a grant to be provided by the \nGovernment of the Netherlands for subprogram 1 of the Program. \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n2.  The fiscal performance of most Indian states has deteriorated rapidly during the last \ndecade in large part because rigid administrative procedures and supply-driven approaches to \nservice delivery have made quick adjustment to changing macroeconomic circumstances very \ndifficult. The consolidated fiscal deficit of the central and state governments amounted to 9.6% \nof gross domestic product (GDP) in fiscal year (FY) 2001. The states account for about half of \nthis  deficit.  Real  interest  rate  increases  associated  with  financial  sector  liberalization, \nderegulation of private investment decision making, cumulative impacts of weak regulatory and \nfinancial oversight in power and other utility sectors, and pursuit of populist fiscal policies have \nall contributed to state fiscal deterioration. Civil service and public sector wages have generally \ngrown much faster than the economy over the last 5 years. \n \n3.  The growing fiscal imbalances of states have been reflected as a decline in the quality of \nstate expenditure patterns as nonproductive expenditures gradually replaced growth-inducing \nand socially productive investments. The consolidated current (revenue) account balance of the \nstates thus shifted from surpluses during the 1980s to substantial deficits during the 1990s. In \nKerala, widening fiscal current account deficits went along with an increase in salary, interest, \nand pension outlay as a percentage of revenue receipts (from 71.0% in FY1996 to 92.5% in \nFY2001), while capital spending declined drastically. The Kerala government thus has greatly \ndiminished resources for discretionary spending, including on programs to ensure that the poor \nhave access to basic services. \n \n4.  The emerging crisis of state debt and expenditure composition has led the central \nGovernment to propose a number of important reform initiatives (described in the next section) \nintended to reverse fiscal decline, strengthen regulatory institutions, and improve expenditure \nallocations.  \n \n5.  Kerala\u2019s macroeconomic performance has been dominated over the last 5 years by \nthree major trends: severe fiscal stress; difficulties in adjusting the state's primary economic \nbase  to  changing  external  circumstances,  including  increased  competition;  and  increased \nreliance  on  foreign  remittances  from  nonresident  workers,  fueling  private  consumption \nexpenditures. The Kerala economy grew at an annual real rate of 5.7% in FY1994\u2013FY2001.1 \nOver the same period, real growth rate was 2.2% per annum in the primary sector, 6.1% in the \nsecondary sector, and 7.4% in the tertiary sector. Recent investor surveys rank the state low in \ninvestment attractiveness. The low levels of foreign direct and aggregate private investment in \nthe state indicate a weak investment climate.  \n \n6.  Due to deteriorating fiscal performance, the Kerala government has difficulty meeting its \ndevelopmental commitments. Increasing deficits and compression of nonwage and noninterest \nexpenditures have led to inadequate infrastructure investment and a decline in operation and \n                                                 \n1  Department of Economics and Statistics, Planning Board, Government of Kerala. 2002 unpublished estimates.

A rising debt \nburden has led to an unsustainable fiscal position requiring a substantial fiscal adjustment. The \nstock of state debt expressed as a percentage of gross state domestic product (GSDP) will rise \nfrom 27.5% in FY1996 to an estimated 37.4% by the end of FY2002.  \n \n7.  The state's contingent liability from guarantees extended to support the debt stocks of \npublic enterprises and major utilities, such as the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB), is also \nsubstantially increasing at a rapid rate. The growth in guarantee size is primarily due to \ninadequate commitment to cover costs in power, and weak financial control over key state-level \npublic enterprises (SLPEs) and boards. The aggregate level of guarantees was equivalent to \napproximately 15.2% of GSDP by end-March 2002. \n \nIII.  THE SECTOR \nA.  Sector Description and Performance2  \n8.  Kerala is a small state of 32 million inhabitants, on the west coast of India, and noted for \nhaving the highest social indicators in the country. The state is also remarkable for its high rate \nof  participation  in  political  life  and  high  indicators  of  social  capital.  Despite  the  state's \noutstanding social accomplishments, Kerala's prospects for prosperity are threatened by chronic \nfiscal stress, manifested in the nondelivery of essential services to the poor and marginalized; \ninadequate funding for new infrastructure investment; inadequate resources devoted to O&M; \nmounting arrears to contractors, which undermine competitive procurement; rising debt-to-\nGSDP ratio; accumulated and mounting losses of the more than 100 SLPEs; rapidly increasing \nstock  of  loans  to  SLPEs  and  boards  backed  by  guarantees;  and  KSEB's  acute  financial \ndeterioration.  \n \n9.  Poverty. The state has made important strides in reducing poverty through local self-\ngovernments (LSGs) and the State Poverty Eradication Mission called \u201cKudumbashree.\u201d The \nKudumbashree model of self-employment with community support is based on successful \nexperiments in urban and rural poverty initiatives in the 1990s and organizes women from \nhouseholds below the poverty line into a three-tier structure of self-help groups to tackle the \nvarious dimensions of poverty. The Kerala government recently evaluated the Kudumbashree \nmodel with assistance from the Netherlands Government, and the findings will be used to \nupdate the approach and institutional arrangements to reduce poverty in Kerala.  \n \n10.  A recent participatory poverty assessment3 identified major pockets of acute poverty, \nconcentrating mainly among fishing communities, tribal households, households of cashew nut \nand coir workers, and communities dependent on seasonal employment. Unemployment among \nthe educated young is a major social concern. The assessment highlighted the very high degree \nof indebtedness among the poor, who rely heavily on informal credit systems with interest rates \nas high as 326% per annum. The declining quality of public health and education threatens past \nachievements and future prospects, and imposes additional costs on the poor.  \n \n11.  Service  delivery  to  the  poor  is  constrained  by  weak  targeting  and  prioritizing  of \nvulnerabilities among the poor. The state's survey of poor households, used to identify program \nbeneficiaries, indicates that 43% of the population lived below the poverty line\u2014far higher than \n                                                 \n2  Appendix 1 on Sector Analysis. \n3  ADB. 2000.

", "    3 \nthe official headcount poverty indicator of 12.7%.4 The Kerala government also provides large \nsubsidies in agriculture, rural development, housing, social welfare, and other sectors. An \nintegrated policy on subsidies is urgently needed to avoid waste, inadequate targeting of the \npoor, and multiple agencies delivering subsidized services with overlapping functions at the \ngrassroots. Benefit incidence, including for subsidies, needs to be assessed. The budget needs \nto be made into a strong instrument for pro-poor budgeting.  \n \n12.  Kerala faces four main long-term challenges for an effective poverty reduction strategy:  \n \n(i)  Increase the rate of economic growth while enhancing the conditions to allow \nbroad  participation  in  the  benefits  of  growth,  and  avoiding  environmental \ndegradation.  \n(ii)  Ensure that access to health and education is further broadened and their quality \nimproved within a sustainable financing strategy.  \n(iii)  Find ways to identify and target the poorest and most excluded groups.  \n(iv)  Improve access by the poor to credit at affordable rates. \n \n13.  Tax and Nontax Revenue. In the past decade, the  growth of state tax and nontax \nrevenue has not been buoyant, because of the difficulty of effectively taxing consumption \nfinanced by foreign remittances, a neglect of administration of tax collection and its reform, and \ninadequate commitment to periodic rate adjustment for user fees. Nontax revenues in Kerala \nare low in comparison to the neighboring states. A special committee constituted by the Kerala \ngovernment in 1998 to advise on mobilizing nontax revenues have stressed the need for radical \nimprovements in this area. The transformation of state sales tax into a nationwide system of \nstate-operated value-added tax (VAT) including taxation of services is proposed to take effect \nfrom  April  2003.  This  initiative,  in  which  Kerala  is  participating,  is  intended  to  increase \ncompliance,  drastically  simplify  rates,  and  yield  neutrality  benefits  arising  from  interstate \nharmonization and coordination. Other fiscal distortions that undermine economic efficiency \ninclude  high  stamp  duty  rates  and  inadequate  implementation  of  property  tax  by  local \ngovernments.  \n \n14.  Budgeting  and  Expenditure  Management.  The  budgeting  system  and  supporting \ninstitutional framework for expenditure management and control are not working effectively. \nContributing causes of increased fiscal stress have been a rigid approach to budgeting, implicit \nreliance on a supply-driven priority setting, and a wish to maximize the size of the plan \nindependent of resource constraints. An imbalance between policy objectives and available \nresources is at the heart of much of the financial indiscipline and operational weakness. \nAggregate financial discipline of the budget process is weak, and hard expenditure targets are \nunderdeveloped as evidenced by the tradition of having up to three supplementary budgets per \nyear.  Managerial  autonomy  is  limited,  and  improved  cost-effectiveness  goes  unrewarded. \nPayment arrears thus build up, and flexibility to vary strategic allocations is lacking. Institutional \nprocesses  to  review  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  expenditures  are  weak.  Fiscal \ntransparency is inadequate, leading to inadequate financial control. Annual submissions that \naccompany budget proposals from departments on staff strength cannot be verified by the \nFinance Department. The lack of timely reports and the absence of a midyear assessment of \nbudget and budgetary outcomes deprive decision makers of the intelligence needed to make \ninformed choices about future spending and revenue generation.  Capital and maintenance \noutlays are also neglected because they are discretionary expenditures.  \n \n                                                 \n4 Central Statistical Office, Government of India. ", "4   \n15.  Power Sector. The Kerala government manages and regulates the state's power sector \nthrough KSEB, the monopoly supplier of electricity, which was established under the Electricity \n(Supply)  Act  of  1948.  KSEB  supplies  6.6  million  consumers.  Increased  consumption  of \nelectricity during the last decade has outpaced internal supply, requiring increased reliance on \nhigh-cost  sources  of  external  supply.  The  financial  performance  of  KSEB  has  rapidly \ndeteriorated, resulting in large implicit subsidies leading to a mounting stock of state guaranteed \ndebt. The absence of an independent regulator, and noneconomic interventions in tariff setting \nhas contributed to inadequate cost recovery. High rates of transmission and distribution losses, \nreported to be at least 30% of generated supply, high cost of purchase of thermal energy, high \ncost of finances, cost overrun of projects, and operational inefficiency have deepened the \nfinancial crisis. Although the Kerala government raised power tariffs by 25% in mid-2001, the \nrate of increase fell far short of the 60% increase that was proposed in the White Paper on State \nFinances.  A  further  increase  took  effect  in  early  October  2002,  necessitated  by  KSEB's \nworsening cash flow resulting from the adverse impact of the low monsoon on availability of \nhydropower. \n \n16.  State-Level  Public  Enterprises.  Kerala  has  111  active  SLPEs.  The  public  utility \nsubcomponent, including KSEB, accounts for the largest shares of investment (68%) and \nemployment (47%), and for the highest share in the aggregate loss of the state public sector. \nSLPEs are vulnerable to national and international competition that has recently intensified as a \nresult of India\u2019s World Trade Organization commitments. SLPEs' productivity has also declined \nowing to inadequate investment. The special interdepartmental enterprises reform committee \n(ERC) was established with an advisory mandate to develop an action plan to restructure and \nreform  SLPEs.  The  ERC  brought  out  its  first  approach  paper  on  SLPE  reform  and  has \ndetermined criteria to prioritize SLPEs for restructuring.  \n \n17.  Local Self-Government. Kerala is recognized nationally and internationally as having \npioneered  decentralization  in  the  1990s,  giving  broad  powers  to  LSGs  to  improve service \ndelivery and make government more accessible to the poor. The LSGs have made considerable \nprogress  in  this  regard  and  in  providing  housing,  water,  and  sanitation.  However, \ndecentralization is incomplete. The Kerala government has a policy to transfer a third of its plan \nfunds to LSGs but continues to employ and pay the wage bill for staff in key social sectors and \nhas not transferred funds for O&M of assets. The fiscal crisis has created fund shortfalls. As a \nconsequence, there is a serious backlog in the maintenance of schools, hospitals, and water \nsupply systems that have been transferred to LSGs. Decentralization entails new lines of \naccountability and reporting. Without interfering, the Kerala government can assist by providing \nperformance  information  to  LSGs  and  build  independent  monitoring  mechanisms  such  as \nparent-teacher associations, health boards, and various civil-society watchdogs. The Kerala \ngovernment has undertaken a study funded by the Netherlands Government to analyze and \nsummarize the experience of the past 6 years. The LSG action plan and capacity building \nprogram also draw on findings of the review and the recommendations of the State Planning \nBoard (SPB).   \n \n18.  Service Delivery. The quality of basic services by LSGs and the Kerala government has \nbeen deteriorating for a number of reasons: (i) diffused accountability caused by the incomplete \ntransfer of local government functions from the Kerala government, (ii) inadequate measures \nand lack of adequate resources to address the capacity-building requirements of LSGs, (iii) \nemphasis on spending plan funds on new initiatives at the expense of allocating money for \nO&M, (iv) nonplan and a significant component of the plan funds going to pay staff salaries, (v) \nlack of a citizen-centered service delivery culture, (vi) few opportunities for the community to ", "    5 \naudit the services provided by LSGs and the Kerala government, and (vii) lack of mechanisms \nto track the public expenditure that goes into service delivery.  \n \n19.  Core Government Functions.5 The public sector operates with little concern for results, \nan almost complete absence of a service culture, overlap and duplication across levels of \ngovernment, and policies riding on fragmented systems and processes of government.6 Policy \nformulation and coordination are diagnosed as paying insufficient attention to transparency and \nformal  consultation  processes.  Inadequate  attention  is  given  to  policy  implementation, \nenforcement, and monitoring. Norms for civil service staffing have not been fundamentally \nreviewed in many decades, which contributes to excessive staffing in major infrastructure \ndepartments such as irrigation and public works. Frequent transfer of senior officers leads to \nreduced employee efficiency as well as reduced opportunities for staff to develop subject matter \ncompetencies. Payrolls, pensions, and personal records have not been computerized or linked, \nthus deterring effective management decision making on human resource issues.  \n \n20.  Many powers and functions related to delivery of essential services and local economic \ndevelopment have been transferred from the Kerala government to LSGs. Unfortunately, the \ntransfer did not result in the restructuring of the Kerala government, which now has more than \n17,000 surplus staff.7 A further 5,000 should be transferred to LSGs along with requisite \nfunctions.  The  Kerala  Administrative  Reforms  Committee  has  made  a  number  of  sound \nrecommendations  to  remove  impediments  to  public  sector  performance.  These \nrecommendations will need to be implemented in a coordinated manner across all levels of \ngovernment. \n \nB.  The Kerala and Central Governments' Strategy  \n21.  The Partnership between the Kerala and Central Governments. The fiscal and \nstructural problems described above are also experienced by many other states and have led \nthe central Government to propose a number of important reforms. One is the States\u2019 Fiscal \nReform Facility, which provides grant resources and a broad agenda for structural reforms to \nhelp states meet fiscal targets. Eighteen states have received additional funding from the central \nGovernment on the basis of improved fiscal performance. Participating states have agreed to \ndevelop a medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF) that quantifies the impacts of reforms and \nensures that policies are consistent with sustainable future outcomes for debt and deficit levels. \nA  second  incentive  program  to  encourage  structural  reform  in  operational  and  financial \nimprovement in the power sector is the Accelerated Power Development and Reform Program, \nwhich provides concessional financing to states for power improvements against a time-bound \nset of reform milestones. The Kerala government has reached agreements with the central \nGovernment on reform measures for the power sector, which are reflected in a memorandum of \nunderstanding (MOU) between the Kerala government and Ministry of Power, dated 20 August \n2001; and fiscal reform measures under the letter of shared fiscal goals and objectives from the \nKerala government to the Ministry of Finance, dated 4 February 2002.8 The Kerala government, \nalong with KSEB, is participating in a national agreement for the securitization of arrears owed \nby state electricity boards to central power utilities.  \n                                                 \n5  Para. 17 in Appendix 1 provides more information on core functions. \n6  The Kerala Government. 2002. Modernizing Government Program Strategy Document.  \n7  The number of state government employees, including teachers in government institutions, increased from 270,000 \nin FY1981 to 332,000 in FY2000. Together with teachers in aided institutions and employees of SLPEs, the total \nnumber of employees supported by the Kerala government was 478,000 in FY2000. \n8  In a letter dated 10 June 2002 to the central Government, the Kerala government agreed to incorporate the power \nsector deficit in the consolidated revenue deficit, and to include state guarantees in the consolidated debt stock. ", "6   \n \n22.  The Tenth Five-Year Plan (2002\u20132007). In keeping with the decisions of the National \nDevelopment Council, the Kerala government has formulated the Tenth Five-Year Plan, which \nfocuses on reforms, poverty reduction, and economic development. In line with the plan, the \nKerala government has identified a series of reform initiatives: (i) a medium-term fiscal reform \nprogram; (ii) power sector reform; (iii) administrative and governance reforms; (iv) restructuring \nof laws through the law reform committee; (v) phased SLPE reform; (vi) control of restrictive \nlabor practices through a clear labor policy; and (vii) provision of an economic growth policy \nenvironment through enunciation of policies on industry, labor, information technology, tourism, \nand urban development.9 \n \n23.  Modernizing  Government  Program.  The  Kerala  government  has embarked upon \ngovernance and public management reforms to address fiscal stress and restore the delivery of \nessential basic services, particularly to the poor and marginalized. The Kerala government has \ntaken several steps to pave the way for a wide and comprehensive multiyear reform agenda. \nThe reform is guided by the Modernizing Government Program (MGP) steering committee, \nchaired by the chief secretary; a full-time MGP secretary has already been appointed. A \ncomprehensive strategy is supported by strategic implementation plans for the MGP. Five \nteams comprising Kerala government officials were tasked to develop the MGP strategy,10 \nwhich was presented at a workshop in April 2002. The strategy has since been subjected to \nexternal stakeholder consultation, has been approved by the Council of Ministers, and is \navailable on the Kerala government web site. The strategy is underpinned by a number of core \nprinciples  to  ensure  performance  and  enforceability,  accountability,  transparency,  and \nparticipation. The strategy has five components: (i) ensuring a level of basic public services to \nthe poor and marginalized; (ii) building an enabling environment for growth; (iii) achieving fiscal \nsustainability and fiscal targets agreed on with the central Government; (iv) enhancing the \neffectiveness and efficiency of core Government functions; and (v) building on decentralization \nfor efficient, effective, and accessible LSGs.  \n \nC.  Issues and Opportunities \n24.  Placing  state  finances  on  a  sustainable  path  and  simultaneously  addressing  the \nstructural and institutional government problems that have given rise to fiscal stress are key to \nrenewal, broad-based growth, and greater poverty reduction. Prompt action is needed so that \nthe Kerala government can respond to central government policy initiatives and derive the full \nbenefits from mutually supportive reforms initiated by both levels of government.  \n \n25.  An important design issue is the extent to which the initial policy phase of the power \nsector reform will be linked to the Program. Based on the problems experienced in many other \nstates  in  restructuring  their  power  sectors  and  finding  the  financial  resources  to  stop \nunsustainable  financial  and  nontransparent  institutional  practices,  the  central  Government \nstrongly recommended that the early stages of power reform be explicitly integrated into the \ncurrent program design.  \n \n26.  Rationale and Links with ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program. The ADB Country \nStrategy and Program for India supports policy and institutional reforms to (i) achieve equitable \nand universal provision of basic services; (ii) strengthen measures to raise, allocate, and \n                                                 \n9  Appendix 1 provides information on the actions already taken by the Kerala government as part of MGP and the \nagreement with the central Government. \n10  Supplementary Appendixes C and D: MGP Strategy and MGP Issues Papers and Milestone Charts. ", "    7 \naccount  for  resources  in  accordance  with  pro-poor  policies;  and  (iii)  make  government \naccountable and transparent. As state governments must oversee and manage the delivery of \nbasic services, an important dimension of ADB\u2019s strategy is to focus on state-level operations. \nIn the mid-1990s, at the request of the central Government, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh \nbecame the first two focal states for ADB assistance, and Kerala became the third soon after.  \n \n27.  ADB provided a TA for fiscal reforms11 to the Kerala government, and a TA for power \nsector reform is in preparation for a power sector loan.12 The fiscal TA identified institutional \nweaknesses in public expenditure management, budgeting, and general public administration \nas major causes for poor service quality. A key TA recommendation was that fiscal sustainability \ncan only be achieved through implementation of a comprehensive public sector reform program \nunderpinned by sound management change processes. An additional TA13 for administrative \ncapacity to implement VAT will be provided to selected states, including Kerala.  \n \n28.  Kerala  is  also  one  of  the  three  focal  states  for  assistance  from  the  Netherlands \nGovernment.  Its  main  areas  of  support  have  included  local  self-government,  water  and \nsanitation, and poverty eradication. More recently, the Netherlands Government has provided \nsupport to SLPEs and wishes to support reform initiatives in Kerala, and has participated in \ndeveloping MGP. MGP reform measures are fully in line with the Netherlands Government\u2019s \nstrategy for Kerala. \n \nD.  Lessons Learned  \n29.  In formulating this Program, specific attention was given to incorporating lessons learned \nfrom  past  programs,  the  recent  evaluation  by  ADB's  Operation  Evaluation  Department  of \nprogram lending,14 and the assessment of the Gujarat Public Sector Resource Management \nProgram.15  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  supporting  the  Public  Sector  Resource  Management  and \nPower Sector Reform in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh has highlighted the crucial linkage \nbetween the reform of public finances and power sector reform. The program design draws on \nthe lessons learned in the following areas:  \n \n(i)  Program Formulation Process Lessons \n(a)  The Program is based on a locally defined and broadly supported set of \nreforms. Political leaders and other stakeholders have been involved in \nprogram formulation  and will be kept fully aware of the purpose and \nexpected impact of reforms.  \n(b)  Adequate  attention  has  been  given  to  ensuring  a  sound  macro \nenvironment  for  reform,  including  good  governance  and  supportive \nmacroeconomic policies. \n \n                                                 \n11  ADB. 2000.Technical Assistance to India for Supporting Fiscal Reforms in Kerala.

Manila. \n15 ADB. 2002. Gujarat Public Sector Resource Management Program: An Assessment by ADB for the Government. \nManila.  ", "8   \n(ii)  Program Design Lessons \n(a)  The Program period takes into consideration the lengthy process required \nfor  policy  reform,  review  of  reform  options,  and  consensus  building. \nEfforts to increase public awareness of the need for reform have been \nbuilt into program designs. \n(b)  Program objectives are clearly defined, and reforms have been prioritized \nand limited to manageable proportions with a stronger focus on end \nresults.  \n(c)  The reform process involves elements of \u201clearning by doing.\u201d The design \nshould allow for flexibility to modify the program to take into account \nchanges in the external environment and unexpected developments. \n \n(iii)  Program Implementation and Monitoring Lessons \n(a)  Implementation is more difficult and resource intensive than program \ndesign.  The  Program  will  be  closely  and  carefully  monitored,  and \nprocesses are already in place for ongoing dialogue. More systematic and \neffective monitoring arrangements are incorporated into the design.  \n(b)  The Kerala government has developed a communication strategy and \nstarted a process of consultation on key policy documents emerging from \nthe Program. Assessing public awareness, concerns, and support for \nreform measures during program implementation has been factored into \nthe design. \n \n(iv)  Fiscal Reform Lessons \n(a)  The Program has avoided including explicit and precise deficit reduction \ntargets as unexpected exogenous shocks can cause the fiscal position to \ndeteriorate sharply. \n(b)  The Program emphasizes policies and institutions to strengthen fiscal \nmanagement  processes  and  incorporates  policies  and  institutional \nmechanisms for prudent expenditure management.  \n(c)  The Program is balanced with some degree of protection of expenditures \nin education, health, water supply, and sanitation for the program period. \nSocial  factors  of  downsizing  and  other  reform  measures  have  been \nmitigated to an extent by proactive social measures and safety nets.  \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGAM \nA.  Objectives and Scope \n30.  The  Program  will  contribute  to  the  Kerala  government's  poverty  reduction  and \ndevelopment strategy contained in the Tenth Five-Year Plan (2002\u20132007). The objectives of the \nProgram are to support the Kerala government to: \n \n(i)  Achieve fiscal sustainability, including the initial policy actions for power sector \nreform. \n(ii)  Improve the quality, equity,  and value for money of services provided by the \nKerala government and LSGs. ", "    9 \n(iii)  Improve the targeting and quality of the poverty reduction programs and social \nservices. \n(iv)  Strengthen the functions and structures of state and local governments in Kerala \nto increase accountability, responsiveness, transparency, and efficiency. \n \n31.  The  Program  will  facilitate  the  implementation  of  the  Kerala  government\u2019s  reform \ninitiatives, which started in 2001. Under subprogram 1, a coherent set of policies to achieve the \nprogram objectives will be established. Measures to implement, monitor impact of, and establish \naccountability for the new policies will be adopted. The Kerala government and LSGs will begin \npolicy  implementation  in  all  thematic  areas  to  achieve  early  success  and  test  policy \nimplementation  before  embarking  upon  full-fledged  implementation  in  subprogram  2  by \nimplementing projects, which will be designed in subprogram 1. Specific initiatives to assess \npolicy effectiveness and measures to enforce policy will also be included. Criteria will be \ndeveloped during the midterm review of subprogram 1 to prioritize projects for subprogram 2.  \n  \n32.  The Program will be implemented in a phased manner through two subprograms to \nallow for flexibility and provide safeguards against inherent risks. Subprogram 1 is expected to \nbe completed within 24 months from October 2002, and subprogram 2 will be prepared after the \nmidterm review of subprogram 1. Implementation of subprogram 2 will follow immediately after \nsubprogram 1 and is expected to take a further 18 months. \n \nB.  Important Features16  \n33.  The  Program  has  a  number  of  important  features,  which  should  increase  the \nopportunities for benefits to be realized and sustained, including mainstreaming measures and \nsystems to track the performance of actions in the policy matrix, implementing the Program \nusing sound program and project management principles, and developing new policies using \nrevised guidelines to improve transparency and strengthen stakeholder consultation.  \n \n34.  The main features of the Program include the following:  \n \n(i)  building  on  the  successes  of  the  first-generation  social  development  reform \nmeasures, including Kerala's decentralization strategy; \n(ii)  emphasizing areas of poverty that the first-generation reform measures could not \naddress; \n(iii)  integrating fiscal reform with reforms in service delivery and poverty reduction; \n(iv)  forging a partnership among the central, Kerala, and Netherlands governments, \nand  ADB  to  deliver  the  reform  program  of  the  Kerala  government and its \nagreements with the central Government;  \n(v)  including state and local governments in the Program as they have a shared \nresponsibility for service delivery and poverty reduction; \n(vi)  strengthening  intergovernment  relations  by  helping  forge  fiscal  reform \nagreements between the central and Kerala governments; and \n(vii)  institutionalizing relations between state and local governments. \n \n                                                 \n16 Appendix  2  presents  a  chronology  of  the  processes  followed  in  preparing  the  Program.  Appendix  3  and \nSupplementary Appendix B contain information on background studies.  ", "10   \nC.  Policy Framework and Actions17 \n1.  Thematic Area 1: Achieve Fiscal Sustainability \n35.  The fiscal policy framework for subprogram 1 has five components: (i) initial policy \nactions  to  enable  power  sector  reform,  (ii)  SLPE  reforms,  (iii)  MTFF,  (iv)  budgeting  and \nexpenditure management, and (v) strengthening of tax and nontax revenue mobilization.  \n \na.  Power Sector Reform Prior Actions \n36.  The inclusion of the power sector policy measures as prior actions in subprogram 1 \nreflects the urgent need to begin reducing KSEB\u2019s drain on fiscal resources and mounting debt \nand contingent liability burdens that threaten to become future debt for the Kerala government. \nOtherwise, public finances will not become sustainable. The prior actions are designed to play a \ncatalytic role in the early stages of power sector reform. A separate power sector development \nprogram included in the lending program for 2003 will contain structural, institutional, and tariff \nrationalization reforms to achieve, among other objectives, the performance targets contained in \nthe agreements between the Kerala and central governments.  \n \n37.  Under the Program, the Kerala government must first (i) establish and operationalize the \nstate  electricity  regulatory  commission  (SERC);  (ii)  decide  to  finance  the  annual  revenue \naccount deficit of KSEB in an amount not less than such percentage as agreed between the \ncentral and Kerala governments; (iii) decide to have antitheft legislation to strengthen Kerala's \nantitheft program; (iv) have full settlement of dues and liabilities as defined in government \norders and the policy matrix of KSEB and the Kerala government as of 31 March 2002; (v) \ndecide to have state-level power reform legislation for power sector reforms; and (vi) securitize \noutstanding dues of central public sector units (CPSUs) as per the scheme approved by the \ncentral Government and in accordance with the tripartite agreement signed between the central \nand Kerala governments. KSEB will apply for revision of tariffs before SERC within not more \nthan 2 months of its establishment. \n \nb.  Reform of State-Level Public Enterprises  \n38.  The Kerala government has established the ERC to steer and guide SLPE reforms. It \nhas prepared an approach paper, which sets out policies and objectives, and the criteria for \nprioritizing SLPEs. The approach paper has been approved by the Kerala government as the \nframework for implementing SLPE reforms; 11 manufacturing SLPEs have been identified as \npriorities. Reform of SLPEs will help reduce the fiscal burden of the public enterprise sector and \nthereby contribute to achieving fiscal sustainability. The criteria used by the Kerala government \nto prioritize SLPEs are in accordance with the agreement between the Kerala and central \ngovernments. The Kerala government has approved the ERC\u2019s recommendation to restructure \n11 manufacturing SLPEs. Subprogram 1 will enable funding to initiate reform and enable the \nKerala  government  to  restructure,  sell,  or  close  the  11  SLPEs  approved  by  the  Kerala \ngovernment  on  5  October  2002.  The  Kerala  government  will  be  required  to  make  timely \nvoluntary retirement settlement (VRS) payments to employees from the counterpart funds \ngenerated by the Program. In subprogram 1, the Kerala government will, inter alia, also do the \nfollowing:  \n                                                 \n17  The policy framework for subprogram 1 and indicative milestones for subprogram 2 are in Appendix 4. The \nProgram logical framework is in Appendix 5. A summary poverty and social impact assessment is in Appendix 6. \nThe Program implementation costs are in Appendix 7. ", "    11 \n(i)  Finalize and approve the policies on VRS for regular/permanent employees. \n(ii)  Develop and approve a social safety net (SSN) policy for all categories of eligible \nworkers. \n(iii)  Ensure that all stakeholders, including employees, are fully consulted in finalizing \nVRS and SSN. \n \nc.  Medium-Term Fiscal Framework  \n39.  Adopting the MTFF Approach. The Kerala government\u2019s failure to link policy, planning, \nand budgeting has created a situation where these processes are fragmented and planning is \nlimited to an annual exercise for plan expenditure. By developing a consistent and realistic set \nof resource envelopes, the MTFF will improve resource allocation to strategic priorities and \nincrease commitment to predictability of policy and funding over the short to medium term so \nthat departments can plan ahead and programs can be sustained. \n \n40.  The Kerala government finalized its Medium-Term Fiscal Reform Plan (MTFRP) in 2001 \nas part of the agreement with the central Government. A revised set of fiscal projections as of \nNovember 2002 (see Appendix 7) under the MTFRP has been agreed on by the Kerala and \ncentral governments that explicitly incorporate the costs of adjustment of the Program, including \nthose associated with core government functions, LSGs, poverty reduction and minimum-needs \nprogram, and SLPE reform. In addition, the Kerala government updates the MTFRP annually, \nalong with semiannual reporting on performance against targets to help build accountability and \nto ensure that decision making takes place within the parameters of the fiscal plan in the \nMTFRP.   \n \n41.  Fiscal Responsibility Legislation. The Kerala government has decided to introduce \nfiscal  responsibility  legislation  to  strengthen  the  state's  capacity  to  (i)  promote  fiscal \ntransparency, (ii) reduce the incentive to take liabilities off budget in the form of guarantees, (iii) \ninstitutionalize a medium-term perspective into  the budgetary process, (iv) adopt corrective \npolicies to deal with emerging imbalances and fiscal slippage, (v) reduce deficits, (vi) adjust \ntaxes and expenditure to shortfalls in budgetary targets more quickly, and (vii) clarify for the \npublic the medium-term implications of budget policy. Fiscal responsibility legislation has been \nprepared by the Kerala government and is based partly on the central Government\u2019s fiscal \nresponsibility legislation. Karnataka State has already passed a fiscal responsibility act, and the \nPunjab and Maharashtra governments have proposed similar legislation. Fiscal responsibility \nlegislation  in  Kerala  will  be  enacted  and  brought  into  force  in  2003  and  implemented  in \nsubprogram 2.  \n \nd.  Budgeting and Expenditure Management  \n42.  Budgetary reform, especially in resource allocation, is a powerful driver of wider public \nsector reform. Subprogram 1 will focus on the reform of central policy, planning, and budgeting \nsystems.  A  key  element  of  the  approach  is  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  Finance \nDepartment  in  the  secretariat  to  make  strategic  choices  and  lead  in  financial  and  policy \ndiscipline. Subprogram 2 will widen and deepen implementation and completely computerize \nthe new systems in an integrated manner. Subprogram 2 will also continue to build financial \nmanagement capacity.  \n \n43.  Budget Preparation. Fiscal reform is intended to improve expenditure priority setting in \na  multiyear  framework,  and  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  spending  and  resource \nmobilization. The Kerala government is committed to implement its MTFRP as agreed with the ", "12   \ncentral  Government,  develop  multiyear  budgeting  capacity,  and  pass  fiscal  responsibility \nlegislation. One of the first steps in reform is to bring forward the annual budget cycle to ensure \nthe passage of the budget before 31 March of each year. The new budget cycle will be \nintroduced from FY2004 with forward estimates for 2 years, which should integrate with the \ninvestment plan to protect capital investment in the social sectors. The Kerala government will \nalso introduce a simplified medium-term expenditure framework18 in subprogram 1 and provide \nline departments and agencies with a hard budget constraint and increased autonomy, thereby \nincreasing incentives for efficient and effective use of funds.  \n \n44.  Budget Execution. This will be modernized in subprogram 1 to prevent uncontrolled \nborrowing, poor control of funds, poor estimation of timing of revenue and expenditure flows, \nand disregard of hard budget ceilings through overexpenditure and supplementary demand for \ngrants. The budget will be reviewed midyear to enable the adoption of corrective measures.  \nLegislation to cap guarantees will be introduced. Subprogram 1 will consider whether additional \npolicy measures are required for efficient administration and financial discipline. The Kerala \ngovernment  will  prepare  a  midyear  report  not  later  than  31  January  2003  on  budget \nperformance and required midyear correction. The state financial accounts for FY2003 will be \ntabled in the State Assembly before 31 October 2003.  \n \ne.  Tax and Nontax Revenue Mobilization \n45.  VAT and Sales Tax. The introduction of VAT by the states, originally planned for April \n2002, was deferred by the Government to April 2003. In Kerala, a number of critical actions are \nrequired to achieve the Government\u2019s target implementation date: (i) enacting VAT legislation in \nline  with  the  Government\u2019s  requirements;  (ii)  deepening  and  widening  the  VAT  awareness \nprogram for business, tax practitioners, and the public; (iii) strengthening audit capacity; (iv) \ndeveloping  capacity  to  administer  the  self-assessment  system  and  implement  the  tax  on \nservices; and (v) having a dedicated full-time team to implement the system.  \n \n46.  Sales  Tax  Arrears.  The  White  Paper  on  State  Finances  refers  to  the  dismal \nperformance of state-level tax administration. As of 31 March 2002, sales tax arrears amounted \nto Rs17.1 billion. In the Kerala government order issued on 8 October 2002, the Kerala \ngovernment outlined an action plan to strengthen the collection of sales tax arrears and put in \nplace special measures where targets were not met. The Kerala government is also committed \nto  continue  to  adhere  to  the  1999  agreement  among  all  states  not  to  grant  indirect  tax \nconcessions under the sales tax or its successor VAT. Subprogram 1 should see a significant \nimprovement in revenue collections due to the monitoring and reporting system. \n \n47.  Property  Tax.  The  First  State  Finance  Commission  recommended  fundamental \nchanges in tax assessment and collection, the most significant being property tax reform to \nsimplify the system and encourage compliance through the adoption of presumptive methods. \nSPB has recommended that the recommendations for property tax reform be completed without \ndelay. New rules for property tax assessment in accordance with the Panchayat Raj Act (1994) \nand Municipalities Act (1994, as amended in 1999) will be introduced in subprogram 1. Reform \nfor local property taxation will also improve efficiency, transparency, and simplicity, and help \nLSGs mobilize their own resources.  \n \n                                                 \n18 The Kerala government will draw on the guidance provided by (i) ADB. 2000. Supporting Fiscal Reforms in Kerala. \nManila; (ii) ADB. 1999. Managing Government Expenditure. Manila; and (iii) World Bank. 1998. Public Expenditure \nManagement Handbook. \n ", "    13 \n48.  Stamp  Duty.  In  subprogram  1,  the  Kerala  government  will  reduce  the  rate  of \nconveyance (aggregate of stamp duty surcharge and registration fee), including through the \nrationalization of the stamp duty system by fair value fixing. Stamp duty rate reduction, in \nconjunction with adoption of presumptive norms for property valuation tied to the plinth area, is \nintended to improve the fairness, transparency, and buoyancy of the stamp duty and registration \nfee systems while reducing vulnerability to corruption and removing disincentives to efficient \ntransfer of property.  \n \n2.  Thematic  Area  2:  Improve  the  Quality,  Equity,  and  Value  for  Money  of \nServices  Provided  by  the  Kerala  Government  and  the  Local  Self-\nGovernment \n49.  Subprogram 1 will facilitate the design and implementation of an interrelated set of \npolicies comprising policies on service delivery, social audit, and asset renewal. The Program \nwill create the enabling environment for the Kerala government to develop policies in priority \nsectors such as health, education, and water and sanitation services. \n \n50.  Service Delivery Policy. Planning service delivery is a complex process, which should \nbalance  competing  service  demands,  link  closely  with  financial  planning  and  performance \nmanagement systems, reflect users' needs, and involve the community and stakeholders. \nKerala poses special challenges. While LSGs have the mandate to deliver a significant number \nof basic services, the transfer of resources, functions, and responsibilities is incomplete. For \nexample, primary health care centers in village panchayats continue to have to rely on the state \ngovernment through the Health Department for health care staff, purchase of drugs and other \nconsumables, and many other service delivery-related decisions. In some areas, difficulties \narise from the lack of clear responsibility between state and local governments to provide \nservices.  \n \n51.  Under subprogram 1, the Kerala government and  LSGs will develop and implement a \nservice delivery policy framework. Its main features will include (i) customer-oriented service \ndelivery, (ii) a code of practice for result-oriented management in public service delivery, (iii) \nstatutory rights of access  by citizens to service delivery information, (iv) enforcement and \ncompliance measures, (v) external audit to strengthen accountability and transparency, (vi) \nsocial audit for grassroots assessment of service delivery, (vii) monitoring and public reporting \non performance, (viii) institutional arrangements to implement the policy, and (ix) costs of \nimplementing the policy in the priority areas. Funds will be made available from the Kerala \ngovernment and LSG budgets to support independent organizations that will measure service \ndelivery performance. Responsibility for translating the central policy into sector policies or \nlocation-specific policies will be with line departments/agencies and LSGs. \n \n52.  The Kerala government has approved the establishment of a service delivery policy unit \nreporting to the MGP secretary in the Chief Secretary\u2019s Office to design and oversee the \nimplementation of the service delivery policy. The unit will be operational before the end of the \nyear. The first phase of the implementation of the service delivery policy will focus on land \ntransactions in revenue and registration departments, issuance of building permits, and a \nselected number of taluk offices. At the LSG level, the policy will first be implemented in a \nprimary health care center in 14 village panchayats, three municipalities, and one corporation. \nImplementation of the service delivery policy will need to be linked to the budget preparation \nprocesses of the Kerala government and LSGs to ensure consistency in priorities between the \nareas targeted for service delivery improvements and budget allocations.  \n ", "14   \n53.  The outputs from subprogram 1 will be a service delivery policy framework adopted by \nLSGs and the Kerala government. More specifically, LSGs and the Kerala government will plan \nand manage service delivery on the basis of outputs. The roles and responsibilities in service \nprovision between local and state governments will be clarified. Subprogram 1 will develop a \nmethodology for participatory planning for the provision of health care services in primary health \ncare centers and for making inter district comparisons on the quality and quantity of services in \nthe priority areas. The service delivery policy will be reviewed after implementation of the first \nphase and a plan for wider implementation in subprogram 2 will be developed.  \n \n54.  Social Audit Policy. The Kerala government will introduce social audit service delivery \nperformance by assessing the experience of the people service providers are intended to serve. \nWith community participation, the evidence will be collected from households, communities, and \nthe service itself. The social audit will promote accountability, equity, effectiveness, and value \nfor money, and has been used by national and international agencies. To prepare to introduce \nthe social audit next year, the Kerala government has produced a draft policy based on the \nguidelines provided by the central Government and the small-scale village-level experiments in \nKerala. The draft policy is being subjected to wide stakeholder consultation and will be finalized \nduring the first quarter of 2003. During consultation, field trials will be held to get first-hand \nexperience. The results of social audits will inform the service delivery and asset  renewal \npolicies and plans. \n \n55.  The social audit policy will be implemented in health, education, water supply, and \nsanitation in subprogram 1. The key outputs from subprogram 1 will be a social audit policy \napproved through broad-based stakeholder consultation and social audit reports for a focused \ngroup of services, and published in a form readily accessible to the public.  \n \n56.  Asset  Renewal.  Operational  efficiency  and  service  delivery  are  constrained  by \nequipment and infrastructure that have not been maintained. Assets essential to provide basic \npublic services such as primary health and child nutrition services are often in a state of \ndisrepair. The lack of attention given to O&M, combined with the fund shortage and rules \nprohibiting use of plan funds for maintenance, has led to deterioration of assets required to \nprovide basic public services.  \n \n57.  In the FY2002 budget, the Kerala government announced the creation of an asset \nrenewal fund to rehabilitate assets holding back the provision of essential public services. \nSubprogram 1 will help implement an asset renewal policy linked to service delivery and social \naudit policies, and focus on assets required to deliver social services. Key policy components \nwill include criteria for prioritizing services, establishing simple asset management systems, and \nmaking budget provisions to maintain assets. An independent team with suitable resources will \naudit the asset renewal program and report on performance. Criteria for the equitable sharing of \nthe asset renewal fund will also be developed and commence under subprogram 1. \n \n58.  The Kerala government has prepared an asset renewal policy, which is being subjected \nto  wider  consultation  with  LSGs  and  other  stakeholders.  The  institutional  and  funding \narrangements to implement the policy and track its performance will be particularly important to \nensure integration with the Kerala government and LSG priorities and with the service delivery \nimprovement plans. The policy's recommendations to facilitate a trouble-free and regular asset \nrenewal system include (i) amending financial rules to ensure that user charges and other local \ncharges can flow back to maintain assets, (ii) encouraging maintenance contracts through build-\noperation-maintenance arrangements, and (iii) rationalizing and making transparent the system \nof spares and consumables and their distribution.  ", "    15 \n \n59.  Key subprogram 1 outputs are (i) an asset renewal policy approved by the Kerala \ngovernment and supported by an asset renewal fund and appropriate institutional arrangements \nto administer, manage, and monitor the policy; (ii) restoration of assets in priority areas; and (iii) \nestablishment of an asset management system and policies to ensure that funds are allocated \nfrom the budget for future asset maintenance in priority areas where assets have been restored.   \n \n60.  Right  to  Information  and  Public  Disclosure.  An  integral  part  of  modernizing \ngovernment is making it transparent and accountable. Public servants withhold information from \ncitizens for many reasons. Several states now have laws giving citizens the right to access \ninformation  on  affairs  of  the  state  or  public  bodies.  The  Kerala  government  has  drafted \nlegislation on the right to information to complement and strengthen service delivery and social \naudit policies and to allow access to information held by the Kerala government, LSGs, and \nSLPEs. The legislation will set out institutional mechanisms for enforcement and appeals, and \nprovide for the publication of model schemes. Enactment of the legislation is a second-tranche \ncondition, and an action plan to implement the legislation will be developed by the Kerala \ngovernment and LSGs. Implementation will commence in subprogram 2.  \n \n3.  Thematic  Area  3:  Improve  the  Targeting  and  Quality  of  the  Poverty \nReduction Programs \n61.  Poverty Monitoring. A poverty monitoring unit will be established in SPB to monitor, \nreport on, and manage the poverty database; and coordinate the provision of poverty data and \ninformation. Under subprogram 1 the poverty unit will (i) establish a new poverty database for \nthe state; (ii) introduce systems and processes to ensure that the database is updated through \nregular validation by the community, and government processes; (iii) track the performance of \nKerala  government  and  LSG  initiatives  to  reduce  poverty;  and  (iv)  manage  the  quality, \naccessibility, and timeliness of the poverty database. The poverty unit will make the database \navailable to organizations that help reduce poverty and provide subsidized services to the poor.  \n \n62.  Antipoverty  Subplan.  A  study  is  to  be  undertaken  by  the  Kerala  government  on \nrestructuring subsidies for index based entitlement, that is expected to be completed by 30 June \n2003. An antipoverty subplan under the subprogram 1 will take into account findings of the \nstudy. An antipoverty subplan policy was initiated in the Kerala government\u2019s Tenth Five-Year \nPlan, and a working group to prepare and oversee policy implementation has been set up in \nSPB. Similar working groups are being set up by LSGs, and a special chapter on poverty and \nthe means to reduce it will become mandatory in the plan document of LSGs. The Kerala \ngovernment has issued a handbook, and under subprogram 1, LSGs will develop antipoverty \nsubplans. Six hundred officials have been trained and allocations earmarked for special groups: \n(i) women\u201410%; (ii) the disabled, aged, and children\u20145%; and (iii) scheduled castes\u201420%. \nThe antipoverty subplan, study on subsidies, and updated poverty database will provide the \nenabling environment for the Kerala government to meet poverty reduction targets in the Tenth \nFive-Year Plan. \n \n63.  Coordination of Poverty Reduction Schemes and Access to Credit by the Poor. \nState  and  centrally  sponsored  schemes  for  poverty  reduction  are  implemented  with  little \ncoordination or management. Subprogram 1 will provide guidelines to LSGs for coordinating all \npoverty-related  schemes  to  ensure  coherence  and  consistency,  and  provide  training. \nSubprogram 1 will produce a strategy to increase the poor's access to credit, while subprogram \n2 will implement the strategy. \n ", "16   \n64.  Key outputs will be an effective system of monitoring poverty, LSG antipoverty subplans \nbacked by funds and systems to track performance, and sound and transparent information on \nsubsidies to facilitate resource allocation and improve the targeting of subsidies. \n \n4.  Thematic Area 4: Strengthen the Functions and Structures of the Kerala \nGovernment  and  Local  Self-Government  to  Increase  Accountability, \nResponsiveness, and Transparency \n65.  Strengthen Policymaking. The quality of policymaking has a direct impact on the \nquality  of  public  services.  The  underlying  principles  of  improved  policy-making  processes \ninclude  (i)  developing  policy  by  adopting  a  more  consultative  and  inclusive  approach,  (ii) \nfocusing on outputs and outcomes, (iii) taking into consideration capability and local capacity to \ninterpret  and  implement  the  policy,  (iv)  making  a  preliminary  assessment  of  the  costs  of \nimplementation, (v) mainstreaming gender and poverty considerations in policymaking, (vi) \nestablishing institutional mechanisms for measuring the activities and outcomes expected from \nthe  policy,  (vii)  reviewing  the  policy  after  a  period  of  implementation,  (viii)  incorporating \nmeasures and institutional arrangements for enforcement, and (ix) putting in place appropriate \nsanctions  needed  for  noncompliance  and  incentives  to  achieve  performance  targets.  New \npolicies developed under subprogram 1 should be supported by an implementation plan and a \nperformance monitoring and reporting system. For policies where the initial poverty and social \nimpact assessment19 (IPSA) recommends a more detailed assessment, provision will be made \nfor this. \n \n66.  Surplus Staff Redeployment. The  Kerala government has over 17,000 surplus staff \nand over 5,000 that need to be transferred to LSGs. The Kerala government has decided to \nredeploy surplus staff, including transferring them to LSGs to solve staff shortages.There is a \nban  on  the  creation  of  new  posts  and  controls  on  the  intake  of  new  staff.  The  Kerala \ngovernment agreement with the central Government requires the attrition rate to be maintained \nat minimum 1%. A surplus staff committee has set a target of redeploying at least 20% of the \nstaff in subprogram 1. A unit has been set up in the Personnel and Administration Department \nto redeploy the 17,000 staff identified by the committee. The Kerala government has consulted \nrelevant stakeholders and the committee, and, jointly with relevant departments, identified the \nsurplus staff. The initiative will directly benefit LSGs as they are short-staffed in several areas. \nThe surplus staff policy combined with a carefully managed human resources management \npolicy will improve productivity and release funds for socially desirable investment. \n \n67.  Closure  of  Long-Pending  Infrastructure  Projects.  The  Kerala  government  has \nprepared a policy to review and close long-pending infrastructure projects in several sectors, \nincluding irrigation, roads, and water supply. The initiative is to close nonviable long-running \n(over  5-year)  infrastructure  projects  on  the  basis  of  sound  criteria  and  evaluation  by  a \nmultidisciplinary  team  and  the  consideration  of  a  committee  set  up  for  the  purpose.  In \ndeveloping the criteria, consideration will be given to the policy for the sector. Economic \nconsiderations will be incorporated into administrative decisions on the future of incomplete \ninfrastructure projects. This exercise will lead to the release of resources and create the fiscal \nspace to address development priorities. At the end of subprogram 1, a plan for termination of \nlong-pending  projects  in  irrigation  and  harbor  engineering  departments,  which  have  been \nevaluated  by  expert  teams  and  recommended  by  the  committee  as  unproductive,  will  be \napproved.  \n                                                 \n19   The IPSA was carried out by the Center for Development Studies, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, for the policy \nmeasures in the Program. ", "    17 \n \n68.  Integrated Payroll and Personnel Computerized System.  The Kerala government \nhas prepared a concept note for a computerized payroll and personnel management system to \nreplace the manual system. The concept note describes the current system and its limitations, \nand outlines the proposed system and standardization approach across departments. The \nsystem will considerably benefit data and information management and human resources. The \nsystem  should  reduce  the  time  for  employees  to  receive  their  salaries  and  make  payroll \npreparation significantly more efficient. The personnel records subsystem will become the \nprimary information base for managing the redeployment of surplus staff. The system will be \nintroduced initially in the secretariat, including the Commercial Taxes Department. \n \n69.  Local Self-Government. On 1 October 2002, the Kerala government approved an \naction plan prepared by SPB to address the major constraints facing LSGs. Key elements of the \naction plan will be implemented in subprogram 1. The outputs will include (i) measures to \nrationalize, dissolve, and merge parallel bodies and institutions that are in conflict with the \nmandate of LSGs; (ii) transfer and integration of the various centrally sponsored schemes to \nLSGs; (iii) ensuring that critical vacancies and shortages in technical and specialist staff are \nsolved  by  transfer  of  surplus  staff  from  the  Kerala  government,  direct  recruitment,  or \noutsourcing;  (iv)  establishment  of  basic  systems  and  processes  for  effective  financial \nmanagement;  and  (v)  completion  of  the  transfer  of  staff  and  services  from  the  Kerala \ngovernment, including transfer of the rural water supply schemes after rehabilitation using the \nasset renewal facility. The procedures for the transfer of the budgets relating to salaries will also \nbe  finalized  in  subprogram  1,  with  the  actual  transfer  envisaged  under  subprogram  2.  A \nsubmission has also been made to the Council of Ministers to lift the 1999 stay order to abolish \ndistrict rural development agencies and redirect funding from the centrally sponsored schemes \nto district panchayats. Council approval of the submission will be a powerful positive signal of \nthe Kerala government\u2019s commitment to decentralization.  \n \n70.  Second State Finance Commission Recommendations. In its report to the Kerala \ngovernment in January 2001, the Second State Finance Commission recommended many \nimportant measures, including inter alia, the following: (i) measures for LSGs to raise their own \nrevenue, (ii) streamlining of government grants; and (iii) a maintenance fund for asset renewal. \nA subcommittee of secretaries was especially constituted to review the report. The Kerala \ngovernment  will  decide  on  these  and  other  recommendations  of  the  commission  for \nimplementation, in subprogram 1.  \n \n71.  Capacity Building in Financial Management. The Kerala government has prepared a \npolicy to build financial management capacity in LSGs. The policy is being converted into a \ndetailed plan for implementation in subprogram 1. The policy has four interrelated components: \n(i) legislative provisions, rules, manuals, government orders, and circulars; (ii) setting up of \nsimple and effective operating systems; (iii) institutional arrangements for training delivery; and \n(iv)  human  resource  development.  A  committee  comprising  secretaries  from  the  LSG \nDepartment, planning secretary, MGP secretary, expenditure secretary, and the director from \nthe Local Government Training Institution will monitor the performance of the capacity-building \nprogram. Subprogram 1's output will be the completion of the first phase of the program and \nperiodic performance monitoring reports from the committee. The Kerala government will set \naside 0.33% of the plan allocation to LSGs for capacity building and progressively increase this \nportion to 1.5%.  \n ", "18   \n72.  Restructuring the Secretariat.20 The most significant changes in the core functions of \nthe Kerala government came about as part of decentralization. However, little has changed in \nthe organization of the government machinery, and the functions and structures of the Kerala \ngovernment must be aligned with the core functions, otherwise the Kerala government will have \nincreasing difficulty in delivering its core functions effectively, efficiently,  and  economically. \nSenior officials are occupied with operational activities at the expense of policymaking and \noverseeing policy implementation. The Kerala Administrative Reforms Committee, set up in \n2000, recommended changes to the structures and functions of the secretariat and associated \ndepartments. The MGP task team responsible for core government functions proposed a two-\nstage  functional  review  of  functions  and  structures:  (i)  across  departments  and  (ii)  within \ndepartments.  \n \n73.  The Kerala government is establishing a functional review unit in the chief secretary\u2019s \noffice,  reporting  to  the  MGP  secretary.  This  unit  will  guide  and  steer  the  process.  Kerala \ngovernment  officials  will  conduct  reviews  in  a  number  of  departments  in  the  secretariat, \nincluding the Finance Department, and on the basis of these reviews, prepare restructuring \nproposals and recommend secretariat functions and structure.21 \n \n74.  The main outputs from subprogram 1 are (i) a functional review methodology approved \nby the Kerala government and officials with the capability to conduct the reviews, (ii) Kerala \ngovernment approval for restructuring of the secretariat (including the Finance Department22) \nand the Commercial Taxes Department, and (iii) a plan for the Kerala government to complete \nthe reviews in the remaining departments. The cross-departmental review will provide a road \nmap for changes in functions and structures across departments. Under subprogram 1, the \nfunctions  and  structures  between  the  LSG  and  rural  departments  will  be  rationalized. \nSubprogram 2 will focus on implementing the proposals to restructure the secretariat. Functional \nreviews will be extended to other departments and agencies.  \n \nD.  Financing Plan \n75.  The Government has requested a loan of $200 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance subprogram 1. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee of 1.0%, and such other \nterms and conditions as set forth in the draft Loan and Program Agreements. The central \nGovernment will make Loan proceeds available to the Kerala government promptly as required \nfor  subprogram  1.  The  central  Government\u2019s  current  policy  of  assistance  to  the  Kerala \ngovernment  is  a  loan-grant  ratio  of  70:30.  The  central  Government  will  bear  the  foreign \nexchange risk on the loan. The central Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its \ndecision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and \nconditions; and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision, not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n76.  The Government of the Netherlands will support the reform agenda set out by the Kerala \ngovernment through MGP, and contribute $50 million to subprogram 1 as a grant in addition to \nthe ADB Loan. The Government of the Netherlands has agreed to an arrangement of joint \n                                                 \n20  State headquarters of government departments. \n21 The  Kerala  government  will  receive  support  through  a  TA  (ADB.  2002.  Strengthening  State  Government \nEffectiveness and Accountability in Kerala. Manila) to design and implement a functional review methodology.  \n22 The restructuring of the Finance Department will be linked to the modernization of the budgeting and expenditure \nmanagement system. ", "    19 \ncofunding with ADB, which will administer the funds, on the basis of a common policy matrix. \nThe joint monitoring of the milestones in the policy matrix will minimize the administrative \nburden on the Kerala government.23  \n \nE.  Financial Implications of the Reform Program \n77.  Program implementation will involve substantial adjustment costs estimated at $592 \nmillion during almost 4 years (Table 1). These costs are associated with specific policy actions \nunderlying the reform program, including, inter alia, transitional budgetary impact of power \nsector and public enterprise reforms, loss of revenue on account of rationalization of the tax \nsystem, expenditure on asset renewal, improved service delivery, capacity building of LSGs, \nand functional review and organizational change in institutional setup. Further cost details are in \nAppendix 7. \n \nTable 1: Financial Implications of the Reform Program \nItem  Cost \n($ million) \nTransitional Budgetary Impact of Power Sector Reform  148.3 \nRevenue Losses of Tax Measures  71.3 \nCost of Public Enterprises Reform  54.7 \nSocial Funding Arising from TP Account Closure  65.1 \nMGP Coordination and Program Management  1.5 \nService Delivery Improvements  136.2 \nImproving Targeting and Quality of Poverty Reduction Programs   19.8 \nStrengthening Local Government Functions and Structures  49.9 \nStrengthening State Government Functions and Structures  44.8 \nTotal  591.9 \n        MGP = Modernizing Government Program, TP = Treasury Accounts for Shared Cost Programs \n \n78.  Counterpart funds will be used to finance costs of structural adjustments under the \nProgram, including (i) the cost of the Program\u2019s interventions in service delivery improvement in \nthe social sectors through asset renewal, social audit, and capacity building; (ii) the  cost of \nimplementing the LSG action plan to complete decentralization; and (iii) the cost of restructuring \nand strengthening the state government to become more effective and efficient.24 \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements  \n1.  Program Management \n79.  The Kerala government will be responsible for the effective administration and utilization \nof the loan proceeds and the counterpart funds. The Kerala government will appoint the Office \nof the Chief Secretary and the Finance Department to be the program executing agencies \n(EAs).  The  MGP  steering  committee,  which  will  be  responsible  for  overall  coordination, \nimplementation, and monitoring of the Program, will assist the EAs and report to the MGP \ncabinet subcommittee chaired by the chief minister. The MGP steering committee will be \nheaded by the chief secretary, and comprise the principal finance secretary, principal power \n                                                 \n23  In addition, the Government of the Netherlands is willing to fund technical assistance required to strengthen \nprogram management, capacity building, communications, and other relevant activities in support of MGP. The \ntechnical assistance requirements will be finalized as part of preparation of detailed implementation plans due on \n31 December 2002.  \n24  Please see para. 107 for details. ", "20   \nsecretary, MGP secretary, and all secretaries of departments participating under the Program. \nThe MGP steering committee will meet at least once every month to review and report on the \nprogress and performance of the Program to the (i) MGP cabinet subcommittee and (ii) monthly \nmeeting of secretaries of the Kerala government.  \n \n2.  Period of Implementation \n80.  The period of implementation for subprogram 1 will be from October 2002 to September \n2004. Based on progress under subprogram 1, the proposal for subprogram 2 is expected to be \nsubmitted for separate Board consideration, envisaged before end 2004. \n \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement \n81.  The loan proceeds will finance the foreign exchange costs (excluding local duties and \ntaxes) of items produced in and procured from ADB\u2019s member countries, other than ineligible \nitems  (Appendix  8)  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  All \nprocurement will be through normal commercial practices in case of procurement by the private \nsector, or prescribed procedures acceptable to ADB in case of procurement by the public \nsector, with due regard for the principles of economy and efficiency. \n \n82.  In accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures \nand Related Requirements for Program Loans, the proceeds of the program loan will be \ndisbursed to the Government as the Borrower. No supporting import documentation will be \nrequired if, during each year in which the loan proceeds are expected to be disbursed, the value \nof the Government\u2019s total imports minus imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, \nand imports financed under other official development assistance is equal to or greater than the \nloan amount expected to be disbursed during such year. The Government will, however, certify \nwith each withdrawal request its compliance with this formula. Otherwise, import documentation \nunder existing procedures will be required. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of loan \nproceeds and verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. Loan proceeds may be used \nto finance eligible imports for which expenditures were incurred 180 days before the loan \nbecomes effective. \n \n4.  Counterpart Funds \n83.  The rupee counterpart funds to be generated out of the loan proceeds will be transferred \nby the central to the Kerala government. The counterpart proceeds will be treated as an addition \nto the transfers allocated annually from the central to the Kerala government.  \n \n5.  Monitoring and Tranching25 \n84.  A cluster program modality comprising subprograms 1 and 2 is proposed. The program \ncluster approach will not only allow flexibility, but also safeguard against inherent risks and \npermit the uncoupling of power sector reform agenda from other policy areas after the prior \nactions in the policy matrix are fulfilled. Two tranches are envisaged under subprogram 1, which \nwill last  24 months, from October 2002 to September 2004. Subprogram 2 will be prepared \nfollowing the midterm review of subprogram 1 to allow a full 12 months of implementation \nexperience to inform the content and design. Subprogram 2 will be presented for consideration \nand approval by the ADB Board based on progress in implementing subprogram 1, status of the \n                                                 \n25  The loan implementation schedule is in Appendix 9. ", "    21 \nproposed policy actions, and readiness of the Kerala government to implement the proposed \nreforms in subprogram 2. The loan for subprogram 2 is expected to start in late 2004 and will be \ndeveloped through consultation among the central, Kerala, and Netherlands governments, and \nADB. Appendix 4 provides an indicative list of milestones expected to be achieved at the end of \nsubprogram 2. \n \n85.  The loan will adhere to the following tranching pattern: subprogram 1 will provide loan \nresources equivalent to $200 million to be divided into two equal tranches, and subprogram 2 \nwill provide loan resources equivalent to $100 million, also to be divided into two equal tranches. \nA parallel grant from  the Government of the Netherlands is proposed to augment the loan \nresources by helping the Kerala government absorb the costs of adjustment under the loan. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n86.  The central and Kerala governments will maintain separate accounts and records for the \nloan including separate budget heads of accounts for each of the items of expenditure under the \nProgram in accordance with sound accounting principles, and will have such accounts audited \nannually in accordance with standards acceptable to ADB, and provide certified copies of the \nsame to ADB promptly after their preparation but not later than 9 months after the close of the \nfiscal year to which the accounts refer. \n \n7.  Program Performance Management \n87.  By  not  later  than  January  2003,  the  Kerala  government  will  set  up  a  program \nperformance management system (PPMS) as agreed on with ADB and cause it to be operated \nthroughout program implementation. Under the PPMS, the Kerala government will periodically \nreview the Program, drawing on ADB's performance management system guidelines, to assess \nand  evaluate  the  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  benefit  monitoring,  progress,  and \nachievement of the Program. Quarterly PPMS reports will be submitted to the MGP cabinet \nsubcommittee and published on the Kerala government\u2019s web page. The Kerala government will \nmake available the PPMS reports to ADB and the Government of the Netherlands on a quarterly \nbasis within 2 weeks after the respective quarters. The Kerala government will also provide ADB \nand the Government of the Netherlands with central and Kerala government monitoring and \nevaluation reports on fiscal reform measures under the Letter of Shared Fiscal Goals and \nObjectives, and the tripartite agreement between central and Kerala governments, and the \npower sector reforms related MOU between the Ministry of Power and Kerala government. On \nprogram completion, but not later than 3 months after, the Kerala government will provide ADB \nand  the  Government  of  the  Netherlands  with  a  program  completion  report,  including  an \nassessment of the overall program performance. The Kerala and Netherlands governments, \nand ADB shall carry out periodic reviews of the Program, after each report. \n \n8.  Program Performance Monitoring and Program Review \n88.  The  Kerala  and  Netherlands  governments  and  ADB  will  closely  monitor  program \nimplementation and impact. The Kerala government will provide all information and extend all \ncooperation that ADB and the Government of the Netherlands may require. The monitoring will \ninclude, among other things, MGP, tracking of the overall reduction in the fiscal deficit, and \nadherence to the agreements between the central and Kerala governments on fiscal and power \nsector reforms. The central, Kerala and Netherlands governments and ADB will undertake a \nmidterm review of the Program at the end of 2003 or early 2004. The midterm review will (i) \nreview the program scope, design, and implementation arrangements; (ii) identify changes ", "22   \nneeded since program appraisal; (iii) assess implementation performance against program \nperformance indicators and objectives; (iv) review and establish compliance with the legal \ncovenants; (v) identify problems and constraints; and (vi) the MGP. If the midterm review \ndetermines that changes are required in Program implementation, the Kerala and Netherlands \ngovernments  and  ADB  will  agree  on  measures,  including  changes  in  implementation \narrangements,  to  ensure  that  Program  obligations  are  met.  The  Kerala  and  Netherlands \ngovernments  and  ADB  will  carry  out  a  final  review  after  the  conclusion  of  the  Program \n(subprogram 1). \n \nV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits \n89.  Vision. The Program will contribute to the Kerala government\u2019s overall reform agenda. \nSubprogram 1 will enable the Kerala government to build vital capacity in modernizing of \npolicymaking,  monitoring  the  poor's  access  to  government  services,  and  using  modern \nexpenditure management and budgeting techniques. With these enhanced capacities in place, \nthe state can discourage wasteful expenditures and redirect resources to program activities with \ngreater  social  and  economic  benefits.  Subprogram  2  will  build  upon  the  reforms  and \nstrengthened institutional foundation developed in subprogram 1. The benefits expected from \nsubprogram 1 are outlined below by thematic area. \n \n90.  Fiscal Sustainability.  The Program will help execute the fiscal correction measures \nagreed on between the central and Kerala governments. For the power sector, the program \nmeasures will create sound regulatory and financial foundations for reform. The policy reforms \nwill support a renewed power sector investment program, partly funded under proposed ADB \nlending. Implementation of the Kerala government\u2019s SLPE action plan will reduce the Kerala \ngovernment\u2019s  liabilities,  consolidate  and  improve  the  efficiency  of  the  public  sector  while \ncreating the space for private sector investment. The MTFF will bring about a number of \nbenefits: (i) improvements in the predictability of the resources available, (ii) adoption of new \nbudgets at the start of the financial year by line department, (iii) increased transparency in \nbudget reporting and scrutiny, and (iv) an expanded and institutionalized MTFF system that \nrealistically  identifies  multiyear  resource  envelopes  and  expenditure  commitments  to  help \npolitical leaders make informed choices about expenditures over competing uses over time.  \n \n91.  Improvement  of  Service  Delivery  Quality.  The  Program  will  create  the  enabling \nenvironment and fiscal facility to improve the quality and quantity of services provided by the \nstate and LSGs. Service delivery improvement projects will be piloted in priority social sector \nservice delivery points, and lessons learned will feed into a wider program in subprogram 2. The \nKerala  government  will  create  the  enabling  legislation  to  become  more  transparent  and \naccountable by providing relevant, timely, and useable information to citizens. Subprogram 2 \nwill have initiatives focusing on the implementation of the Right to Information Act.  \n \n92.  Strengthening of Poverty Reduction Programs.  The Program will help the Kerala \ngovernment target the poor, improve efficiency of poverty reduction projects and programs, \nprovide better information on the effectiveness of subsidies for the poor, strengthen the poverty \ninstitutional  network  for  program  delivery  and  poverty  monitoring,  and  develop  a  poverty \nsubplan through a consultative process under subprogram 2.  \n \n93.  Strengthening of Functions and Structures of the Kerala Government and LSGs. \nThe expected benefits include (i) a civil service that will change behavior by focusing on results ", "    23 \nand performance; (ii) introduction of sound, transparent, and consultative policymaking that links \npolicy, planning, and budgets; (iii) more effective utilization of staff and containment of staff \ncosts; (iv) better information to plan and manage human resources; (v) a program to upgrade \nskills of staff for redeployment; (vi) a state government restructured to become more efficient, \neffective, and accessible, and to create the enabling environment for local government to deliver \nits mandate; (vii) improved accountability and authority by LSGs over human resources; (viii) \nincreased financial management capacity in LSGs and considerable learning on how to build \ncapacity in other areas, which would benefit the design of subprogram 2; and (ix) LSGs \nunconstrained by the existence of parallel institutions undermining LSGs' mandate and utilizing \nresources due to LSGs. \n \nB.  Impacts \n94.  Poverty Impact. An IPSA was carried out by the Center for Development Studies, a \nleading think tank on social issues in India, particularly in Kerala (Appendix 6). The study \nconcludes that the policy measures proposed for the power sector and SLPEs do not have a \nmajor adverse impact on the poor. One of the initiatives under the MTFF\u2014to curtail non-interest \ngovernment expenditure as a percentage of GSDP\u2014has the potential to generate an adverse \nimpact on the poor. However, such adverse impact is strongly mitigated by a number of \ncomprehensive initiatives as part of MGP: the LSG action plan and the antipoverty measures. In \naddition, the action under the Program are intended to identify and curtail wasteful expenditure \nthat in turn will free up additional resources for high priority social spending targeted to the poor. \nThe impact of the reform on women will be diverse. SLPE reform might have an adverse impact \non women in some regions and some sectors, but overall the resources released should benefit \nwomen.  Similarly,  the  poverty  reduction  schemes,  particularly  the  Kudumbashree  and \nmicrocredit will benefit poor women. Policy measures for SSN and VRS should mitigate the \nadverse  impact  of  SLPE  reforms  on  women.  Mitigation  measures  in  this  regard  include \nconsultations with all affected employees in developing policies for SSN and VRS.26 \n \n95.  Environmental Impact. An environmental impact assessment of the policy matrix was \nundertaken alongside the IPSA,27 and the assessment concluded that MGP and fiscal reforms, \nincluding in the power sector, will not have an adverse impact on the environment or lead to any \ninvoluntary resettlement problems. More efficient government departments following MGP and \ndecentralization  might  even  help  implement  existing  stringent  laws  against  environmental \npollution and land degradation.  The power sector reforms proposed as prior actions are limited \nto tariff rationalization and fiscal reform measures and, therefore, have no impact on the \nenvironment.   \n \n96.  Involuntary Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples Policies. The Program does not \ntrigger ADB's involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples policies.  \n \nC.  Potential Risks28  \n97.  Policy and institutional reforms, management improvement, and public service reform \nare all subject to considerable risk. A risk management and mitigation strategy will be built into \nprogram management. Risks are of two broad categories: controllable within the Program, and \nexternal and not controllable. Risks within the control of the Program include weaknesses in \n                                                 \n26 See also para. 117. \n27 Appendix 6, para. 22. \n28 Risk mitigation measures are in Appendix 11. ", "24   \ndesign,  poor  management  and  implementation,  weak  capacity  and  inadequate  skills,  and \ninsufficient resources for implementation. Risks that may be controllable include inadequate \npolitical  commitment  and  agreement,  inadequate  commitment  and  leadership  from  civil \nservants, inadequate enforcement of legislation and government orders, and a deteriorating \nfiscal position. Uncontrollable risks are mainly political and those resulting from public action \nagainst reforms.  \n \n98.  Controllable Risks. Given the overarching nature of the Program, it may be considered \nto be ambitious and complex. The Program is the product of lengthy consultations with the \nKerala  government.  The  program  components  have  been  selected  from  the  Kerala \ngovernment\u2019s reform agenda, which is a combination of agreements with the Government and \nthe state\u2019s MGP. It was subjected to extensive peer review in India and draws heavily on \nrecommendations  from  TAs,  and  national-  and  state-level  expert  committee/commission \nreports. Any program attempting to address the systemic problems of a state government is \ninevitably complex. Adopting a simplistic approach is likely to lead to superficial changes with \nlittle benefit. The Kerala government is implementing the Program and has committed to time-\nbound milestones in agreements with the central Government. The Program reflects shared \npriorities of the central and Kerala governments. The cluster approach and monitoring and \nmidterm review arrangements will provide an opportunity for program risks to be assessed and \nappropriate action to be taken, and will allow subprogram 2 to be designed based on the \nexperiences of subprogram 1.  \n \n99.  Often reform programs fail because of weak administrative capacity and inconsistent \nleadership. Kerala is one state where the overall caliber of the public servants is high and which \nhas a critical mass of civil servants who regard themselves as development activists who must \nreduce poverty in the state. Their track record has been very good. By adopting a development \napproach for its reform agenda, the Kerala government has created incentives to mobilize a \ncommitted group of people to take the Program forward. Introducing a service-oriented culture, \nimplementing  modern  budget  and  expenditure  management  systems,  adopting  the  MTFF \napproach, designing new legislation, and carrying out functional reviews will require learning \nnew skills and relinquishing old administrative practices. Although TA covers these activities, \nstrong administrative leadership with ministerial support will be needed to attain targets.  \n \n100.  To ensure maximum support and appropriate authority and accountability, the Program \nis located in the center of the Kerala government and under the chief secretary. A cabinet \nsubcommittee is chaired by the chief minister, who oversees and directs the program.  \n \n101.  To ensure that legislation and government orders are enforced and rules obeyed, all \npolicies,  legislation,  and  government  orders  introduced  by  the  Program  will  have \nimplementation,  monitoring,  and  enforcement  mechanisms  built  into  them.  The  continuing \nchallenge will be to ensure that these measures change behavior.  \n \n102.  Political  Risks.  The  coalition  government  has  a  5-year  mandate  with  3.5  years \nremaining and has solved some difficult reform issues. The Kerala government is determined to \nmake the state investor-friendly and sustain achievements in meeting the social indicators. \nHowever, some interest groups are opposed to fiscal and structural reform and they do not \nunderstand the costs to the state economy of continuing with status quo policies even though \nthe various measures have evolved through extensive discussions and analysis within Kerala. \nThe Kerala government is developing a comprehensive communication strategy that will reach ", "    25 \nout to the various interest groups and secure their commitment.29 The cost of not implementing \nreforms, and the potential risks to present and future livelihoods will be well understood in a \nstate that has high literacy.  \n \nVI.

Background,  Recent  Performance,  Fiscal,  and  Systemic  General  Government \nIssues \n \n1.  Kerala has experienced chronic fiscal stress with mounting contingent liabilities over the \nlast decade. The ratio of interest payments to total state revenue rose from 17.5% in FY1994 to \n21.3% in FY2002. State fiscal performance deteriorated substantially from FY1998 to FY2000, \nleading to a record gross fiscal deficit of 7% of the gross state domestic product (GSDP) in \nFY2000.  Although  some  indicators  of  budget  performance  have  since  improved,  the \nfundamental threat of a deepening fiscal crisis remains because of unresolved contingent \nliabilities caused by deteriorating finances of state-owned enterprises and boards, and because \nof the deferral of structural government reforms needed to ensure efficient and effective service \ndelivery. Indeed, the stock of state-level public enterprises (SLPEs) debt with guarantee has \ngrown at an accelerated rate in the last 2 years. With support from the central Government, \nprogress is being made in strengthening incentives for states to undertake fiscal reforms, and \nthe Kerala government has responded to these incentives by committing itself to an ambitious \nreform agenda.  \n \n2.  Although a strong fiscal correction is necessary to restore state finances to a sustainable \npath, higher real growth could also strengthen fiscal performance. The real annual growth rate is \nestimated to be 5.7% in FY1994\u2013FY2001,1 but the corresponding rate for the primary sector is a \nmere 2.2%. Kerala\u2019s traditional economic base, consisting of agriculture and related processing \nindustries, is adjusting with difficulty to increased competition. Kerala's main remaining engines \nof economic growth are remittances from nonresident workers, and the burgeoning, but still \nsmall, tourism and information technology (IT) industries. However, these growth sectors and \nsources of spending provide few opportunities and benefits for the poor, who derive their \nlivelihood overwhelmingly from agriculture, fishing, and associated basic processing industries. \nThe state has not attracted much secondary manufacturing despite its highly skilled workforce.  \n \n3.  Maintaining real annual growth at 5\u20136% and continuing to reduce poverty will depend \ncritically on the state\u2019s ability to provide key infrastructure support to industry and agriculture \nand to ensure adequate, well-targeted, and high-quality supplies of social services such as \neducation and primary health. Addressing the fundamental structural issues undermining state \nfinances  thus  appears  to  be  key  to  restoring  sustainable  finances  and  establishing  solid \ngovernment support for renewed broad-based and pro-poor growth for the entire economy.  \n \nB.  Constraints and Issues in Developing a Sustainable Fiscal Strategy  \n \n4.  The uncontrolled growth of government guarantees for borrowing by public sector and \nother bodies has emerged as one of the state\u2019s most important fiscal problems. Borrowings \nguaranteed by the Kerala government totaled Rs118 billion by end March 2002, equivalent to \n15.2% of GSDP. Guarantees have grown in magnitude primarily due to inadequate commitment \nto cover costs in power, and weak financial control over key state-level public enterprises \n(SLPEs) and boards. The risk of a substantial proportion of these guarantees being called has \nincreased because guarantee-backed loans have been used recently to fund operating deficits \nand working capital to loss-making enterprises, rather than projects yielding a healthy social rate \nof return. Another type of contingent liability for the Kerala government is its pension burden, \n                                                 \n1  Department of Economics and Statistics, Planning Board, Government of Kerala. 2002 unpublished estimates. ", "  Appendix 1  31 \nwhich is rising rapidly due to increased life expectancy of retirees and the age profile of the civil \nservice.  \n \n5.  Fiscal deficits are also mounting because Kerala, like many other Indian states, has \nadopted deficit financing methods that soften budget constraints, including increased reliance \non  guarantees;  overdraft  facilities  from  the  central  bank;  funds  from  the  public  accounts, \nespecially through state provident funds; and the building up of arrears to contractors.  \n \n6.  The  Government  is  committed  to  reducing  off-budget borrowings by implementing \nfundamental structural reform to restore the financial health of public sector enterprises and \nboards, led by regulatory reform of the power sector. However, until substantial progress is \nmade  in  structural  and  regulatory  reforms,  reporting  of  off-budget  borrowing  in  budget \ndocuments and adhering to the guarantee caps will ensure awareness by the public and \nauthorities of the true multiyear implications of financing decisions. \n \n7.  The  2001  White  Paper  on  State  Finances  identified  expanding  wage  and  salary \nexpenditures, and pensions relative to revenues as a major reason for fiscal deterioration. The \nnumber  of  Kerala  government  employees,  including  teachers  in  government  institutions, \nincreased from 270,000 in FY1981 to 332,000 in FY2000. With another 146,000 employees in \naided  institutions,  local  bodies,  and  SLPEs,  the  total  number  of  government-supported \nemployees in FY2000 was 478,000. However, expenditure needs have not been aligned with \nfundamental demographic changes such as student enrollment, which dropped from 6.5 million \nin 1990 to around 5.6 million in FY2002. Excessive hiring of teachers has resulted in an \nestimated 22,000 teachers without adequate work.  \n \n8.  A  public  consensus  is  emerging  in  favor  of  national  and  state  policies  on  fiscal \nresponsibility to reduce debt, limit borrowing, and rationalize public expenditure. Draft fiscal \nresponsibility legislation is under consideration in a number of states, including Kerala, and at \nthe national level. The intent of these legislative initiatives is to establish much higher standards \nfor government fiscal reporting and potentially, as in the case of draft central legislation, to \nestablish specific multi-year targets for deficit reduction linked to triggers for intrayear targets. \nTo promote fiscal discipline and transparency at the state level, the Reserve Bank of India, in \ncollaboration with a committee of state officials, has also issued guidelines to the states on \ncapping guarantees and improving transparency of state budgets.  \n \n9.  To hold its soft budget incentives in check, the Kerala government has prepared a policy \non capping guarantees and on establishing a guarantee redemption fund with associated \nguarantee fees. The Kerala government has also introduced provisions to avoid future build-up \nof arrears in the power sector by agreement to ensure that the Kerala State Electricity Board \n(KSEB) stays current in payments to central utilities. Better financial management, including \ndebt management, for public enterprises, boards, and other agencies will be needed to improve \nthe quality of loans so that over the medium term, the guarantee fees will be sufficient to \ncompensate assumed risks.  \n \n10.  The Kerala government has initiated a strategy to greatly improve public finances by \ndeveloping a medium-term fiscal framework in consultation with the central Government. Under \nthe medium-term fiscal reform program introduced by the Kerala government in 2001, the \ncentral  Government  has  sought  to  establish  a  consistent  multi-year  framework  for  fiscal \nmanagement. These measures propose to bring about a surplus in revenue budget and to \nreduce gross fiscal deficit and public debt to sustainable levels within 5 years. Other announced \nreforms  with  a  likely  fiscal  impact  are  the  establishment  on  17  November  2002  of  an ", "32  Appendix 1 \nindependent power sector regulator to determine tariff awards, the introduction of value-added \ntax (VAT) in 2003, and the partial freezing of recruitment.  \n \nC.  Expenditure Management and Budgeting  \n \n11.  The  budget-making  system  and  supporting  institutional  framework  for  expenditure \nmanagement and control do not encourage efficiency. The development of a modern budgetary \nsystem that will deliver sustainable fiscal outcomes to better match needs and resources has \nbeen supported under the Asian Development Bank (ADB) technical assistance (TA).2 The TA \nadvisory work and state\u2019s own reform initiatives have been merged into a multiyear strategic \nimplementation plan (designed as part of Modernizing Government Program [MGP]) for phased \nimprovement on budgetary and expenditure management policies and institutional renewal. \n \n12.  Fiscal stress has been worsened by a rigid approach to budgeting, implicit reliance on a \nsupply-driven priority setting, and an intent to maximize the size of the plan independently of \nresource constraints. An imbalance between policy objectives and available resources is at the \nheart  of  much  of  the  financial  indiscipline  and  weaknesses  in  operational  performance. \nAggregate financial discipline of the budget process is weak, and hard expenditure targets are \nundermined by the practice of permitting up to three supplementary budgets. The budgeting \nprocess  does  not  evaluate  the  incremental  recurrent  costs  of  plan  projects,  nor  does  it \nencourage departments to make trade-offs among alternative current and capital uses of funds. \nExcept in formulation of the 5-year plan, the current institutional approach to budgeting is \ninflexible. Institutional processes to review the efficiency and effectiveness of programs are \nunderdeveloped.   \n \n13.  Fiscal  transparency  is  also  inadequate,  leading  to  weak  financial  control.  A  major \ncontributor is the practice of booking unspent allocations to departments as spent at the end of \neach  fiscal  year.  The  lack  of  timely  reports  to  the  executive  and  legislative  branches  of \ngovernment on actual annual budget outturns, and absence of midyear fiscal performance \nassessments deprive decision makers of the information needed to make informed choices \nabout future spending and resource availability. Capital and maintenance outlays are also badly \nneglected under the current approach to budgeting, in part because of a lack of commitment to \nmulti-year budgeting. Maintenance suffers, particularly because nonwage recurrent expenditure \nprovides one of the few sources of discretionary spending. \n \nD.  Resource Mobilization \n \n14.  In the past decade, the growth of state tax and nontax revenues have not been buoyant \nbecause of the difficulty of effectively taxing consumption financed by foreign remittances, a \nweak revenue administration, and an inadequate commitment to periodic rate adjustment for \nuser fees. Sales tax and stamp duty evasion are believed to be high, encouraged by the \nabsence of value-added taxation principles in the former case, and high effective rates and \ncomplex procedures in the latter. The pressures to meet sales tax revenue targets and deterring \ntax evasion and avoidance have led to increased complexity of the system. \n \n15.  The transformation of state-level sales tax into a nationwide system of state-operated \nVAT  is  now  proposed  to  take  effect  from  April  2003.  This  initiative,  in  which  Kerala  is \nparticipating, is intended to greatly simplify the rate structure and provide additional neutrality \nbenefits to interstate harmonization and coordination. This shift should be accompanied by \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to India for Supporting Fiscal Reforms in Kerala. Manila. ", "  Appendix 1  33 \nimplementation of a general strategy for base broadening, including removal of exemptions, and \nrate  reduction.  With  the  adoption  of  VAT,  the  Kerala  government  intends  to  create  an \nenvironment of high voluntary tax compliance by rationalizing the tax structure, modernizing \naudit procedures, raising public awareness, and training department personnel.  \n \n16.  Other fiscal distortions that undermine economic efficiency include  high stamp duties \nand inadequate use of property tax by local government. Stamp duties in excess of 13% have \ndistorted the supply of land and encouraged underreporting and nontransparent procedures in \nproperty valuation for conveyances. The Kerala government is replacing the current system of \nproperty valuation with valuation norms developed by local valuation cells, tied to objective \ncharacteristics of the properties.  \n \nE.  Core Government Functions  \n \n17.  Core government functions, defined as those having an impact on the work of all \ngovernment  departments  as  well  as  policy  formulation  and  coordination  activities,  are \nrecognized  by  the  Kerala  government  as  requiring  major  renewal.  The  recent  diagnostic \nassessments by the task team on core functions of government prepared for the modernizing \ngovernment initiative has grouped the core functions into (i) policy planning, formulation, and \ncoordination;  (ii)  human  resource  management;  (iii)  procurement;  (iv)  citizen  government \ninterface and service delivery; (v) information management; and (vi) government structures and \nintragovernment relations.  \n \n18.  Policy formulation and coordination pay insufficient attention to transparency and formal \nconsultation processes. Inadequate attention is devoted to policy implementation enforcement \nand  monitoring  activities  to  review  the  impacts  of  changes.  Kerala  is  prone  to  policy \nfragmentation because of the state's many departments and linkages between line departments \nand local self-government (LSG) have not been in the planning process, resulting in duplication \nin sector such as agriculture and allied activities. \n \n19.  Norms for staffing civil service have not been fundamentally reviewed in many decades. \nThe civil service thus has too many unnecessary bottom-level positions, which contributes to \nexcessive staffing in major infrastructure departments such as irrigation and public works. Most \ngovernment  departments  have  no  clear-cut  job  definitions  and  responsibilities.  Functional \nreviews in each department will provide a basis for identifying the functions, skills, and staffing \nneeds of the Kerala government, and permit the authorities to gradually transform human \nresources to meet the state's needs. Frequent transfer of senior officers  reduces employee \nefficiency as well as opportunities for staff to develop subject matter competencies. Payrolls, \npensions, and personal records have not been computerized or linked, thus deterring effective \nmanagement decision making on human resource issues. No personnel resource information \ndatabase exists for analyzing the financial implications of new initiatives and cost of service \ndelivery, or for addressing issues such as identifying and redeploying surplus staff.  \n \n20.  The diagnostic assessment indicates (i) the tendency to bypass prescribed procurement \nprocedures, (ii) a low level of delegation of tendering and quotation activities, (iii) inadequate \ncommitment  to  ensure  transparent  and  competitive  processes  for  tendering, and (iv) an \nemphasis  on  process  compliance  during  audit  rather  than  the  quality  of  the  product. \nProcurement in key departments such as public works is characterized by underestimation of \ncosts  for  the  delivery  of  works  as  evidenced  by  tendered  costs  relative  to  Public  Works \nDepartment cost estimates and numerous examples in the Accountant General\u2019s reports of \nmajor cost overruns relative to original estimates.  ", "34  Appendix 1 \n21.  The Government lacks documentation on its own assets, which contributes to assets \ndeteriorating through lack of maintenance and prevents sale of unwanted assets. Citizen-\ngovernment  interface  and  service  delivery  suffer  from  the  absence  of  a  result-based \nperformance-oriented public service. The lack of a service delivery framework specifying service \nstandards, legitimate delivery channels, and procedures for accessing service delivery means \nthat citizens have no basis for knowing their entitlements. Although citizen charters have been \nimplemented in several departments, these instruments have not had a major impact on service \ndelivery. The Kerala government needs to develop policies that indicate when it is appropriate \nor permissible to consider alternative forms of service delivery or procurement to improve \nefficiency and effectiveness. Information flowing out of external auditing by the Office of the \nAccountant  General  might  be  used  as  an  important  tool  in  making  Government  more \naccountable to the people, but this resource is underutilized as a program-monitoring tool.  \n \nF.  Local Self-Government  \n \n22.  The 73rd and 74th amendments to the Indian Constitution mandate the establishment of \nlocal governments as the third tier of government, and list the functions that state governments \ncan devolve to local governments.  Local governments are envisaged as partners of the central \nand state governments in development. The spirit of the Constitution demands creation of LSG \ninstitutions, implying a move toward greater autonomy. Poverty reduction is of prime concern for \nlocal governments. Kerala has gone much farther than any other state in transferring functions \nand  human  and  financial  resources,  and  has  followed  an  unorthodox  strategy  of \ndecentralization. Through a \"big bang\" approach, powers and resources were transferred all at \nonce in 1995\u20131996.  \n \n1.  Problems and Current Situation Analysis3  \n23.  Local governments have been given a wide range of development responsibilities, \nincluding agriculture and allied sectors, traditional industries, poverty reduction, social welfare, \nwomen\u2019s  development,  uplift  of  socially  disadvantaged  groups,  provision  of  connectivity, \nmanagement of health and educational facilities, environmental sanitation, and provision of \ndrinking water. To meet these responsibilities, local governments are being given one third of \nthe Kerala government\u2019s plan resources. However, the way local government plans for and \nutilizes plan funds for development has a number of weaknesses and problems: (i) absence of a \nstrategic vision of development; (ii) key stakeholders not participating in the planning process; \nand (iii) schemes and plans often prepared as repetition of earlier government programs without \ncritical analysis of the current situation, resource endowments, potential for development, and \nlikely returns. The methods adopted to choose schemes or fix priorities have been informal and \nnot based on interpretation of available data. Local governments have not been very successful \nin  planning  for  local  economic  development.  In  infrastructure,  particularly  in  providing \nconnectivity, proper spatial planning techniques are lacking. Local governments do not have a \nmaintenance plan for the assets transferred to them or the assets created by them; asset \nmanagement is weak. Assets that have not been maintained have been transferred from the \nstate government, and budgets for operation and maintenance have not.   \n \n24.  Service delivery to the poor is affected by lack of clarity on whom to target, and how to \nprioritize different vulnerabilities among the poor. The list of people living below the poverty line \nis  inflated  due  to  political  and  bureaucratic  largesse  and  the  desire  to  corner  subsidies. \nSubsidies  are  thus  misdirected  and  spread  too  thin.  Targeting  failure  has  worsened \n                                                 \n3 This is a summary of the problem analysis in the MGP Issues Paper for LSGs. Kerala Government. 2002. ", "  Appendix 1  35 \nindebtedness, food insecurity, and feminization of poverty. LSGs have achieved only limited \nsuccess in natural resource management to increase local productivity. The progress from \nwomen  in  development  to  gender  in  development  has  been  slow  in  respect  of  schemes \nearmarked for women. Similarly, planning has been deficient for socially disadvantaged groups \nsuch as scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and physically and mentally challenged groups.  \n \n25.  Service Delivery. Kerala's celebrated social sector achievements are threatened by the \nfiscal  crisis  and  emerging  social  tensions.  The  impact  is  more  prevalent  with  regard  to \naccessibility and affordability in the areas of health, education, food security, shelter, water, and \nsanitation, mainly due to lack of effectiveness and reach of the public service mechanisms and \naccompanying  tools.  Added  to  this  is  the  lack  of  proper  and  adequate  mechanisms  for \nmonitoring, feedback, evaluation, and reciprocal enforcement. The problem is aggravated by \nsuboptimal utilization of public funds at all levels of the state machinery. Overall quality of \ndelivery of services is affected by the lack of perspective and accountability of the delivery \nmechanisms and the inability of the poor to be involved in community processes that have a \ndirect bearing on their well-being. The management of transferred institutions such as hospitals, \nschools, and transferred public offices is inadequate. Citizen interface with LSGs is not smooth \nas the procedures for service provision are not client oriented. Local governments have not \ndeveloped a constructive relationship with nongoverment organizations. \n \n26.  The  important  issues  to  be  considered  in  health  care  provision  are  (i)  hospital \nmanagement; (ii) quality of primary health care; (iii) lack of doctors and paramedical staff in rural \nareas; (iv) centralized procurement procedures with no delegation, resulting in inadequate \nsupply of drugs, equipment, and other consumables; (v) centralized decision making, resulting \nin  delayed/inappropriate  actions;  and  (vi)  absence  of  a  system  for  accountability  and \nmeasurement of outcomes and impacts. The major issues that adversely impact the functioning \nof  government  and  aided  schools  are  ineffective  implementation  of  educational  policies, \nsuboptimal utilization of funds, inadequate local control and monitoring of education, attitudinal \nproblems of teachers, and absence of periodic reorientation of curriculum and syllabus. As part \nof the day-to-day administration, the public has to approach local governments for matters such \nas obtaining birth and death certificates, getting building licenses, and registering institutions. \nHowever, the harassment and delays the public faces undermine the credibility of the local \ngovernment system. \n \n27.  Financial  Management.  The  financial  management  by  local  governments  has \ntraditionally  been  weak.  A  coordinated  and  intensive  program  is  required  to  address  the \nfollowing problems:  \n(i)  The mode of assessment of property, profession, and entertainment taxes is \ncumbersome and opaque. This, coupled with lack of clear instructions on tax \nassessment, has affected realization of taxes due. Nontax revenue, particularly \nthe fees, fines, and rates, are not revised as revision of rules is slow and difficult. \nCollection of user charges is weak. \n(ii)  Fiscal transfers from government are delayed due to the fiscal crisis. \n(iii)  The systems and procedures for budget preparation and budget execution are \nextremely weak, and although the budgets are open documents, they are not \neasily understood by the layman. The accounting system is cumbersome and \nopaque. \n(iv)  Audit of local governments is not independent as it is done by the Local Fund \nAudit Department under the Finance Department of the Kerala government. The ", "36  Appendix 1 \naudit is also considerably delayed, its quality is poor, and the follow-up on \nsuggestions is slow.  \n \n28.  Public Management. The administration of local governments has deteriorated over the \nyears  due  to  pressure  of  work,  absence  of  systems,  and  low  skill  of  personnel.  Local \ngovernments still follow outmoded office administration systems, which create opportunities for \ncorruption. An office management system needs to be established and rules of business for \ntransacting  the  work  of  elected  bodies  need  to  be  in  place.  The  staffing  profile  of  local \ngovernments has not been changed despite significant additional responsibility. Redeployment \nof staff from the Kerala government, based on the principle of work and worker going together, \nhas not been completed, resulting in staff shortages, especially in engineering and account \nkeeping. The placement and tenure of local government staff is not based on any norms, \naffecting remote local governments, which have unfilled positions. Local government control \nover staff is uncertain, and procurement is very slow and costly. The  Public Works Manual, \nwhich  governs  execution  of  public  works  by  local  governments,  is  archaic  and  allows \ntremendous discretion to technical supervisors.  \n \n29.  Functioning  of  Institutions.  Kerala  adopted  the  model  of  setting  up  strong, \nindependent institutions, particularly to reduce state government control over local governments. \nSome of the institutions have been functioning well. However, resources are needed and a \ncoordinated program of action is required to deal with the problems facing the State Election \nCommission, State Finance Commission, Ombudsman, State Development Council, appellate \ntribunals, and Kerala Urban Development Finance Corporation. The Rural Development Board \nhas become redundant, and the district planning committees have not shown the capacity to \nplan in an integrated manner for the overall development of the district. The Kerala Institute of \nLocal Administration, which is responsible for local government training, has insufficient capacity \nand no resources.   \n \n30.  Policy Environment. The local government policy environment has several problems: \n(i) lack of functional clarity between the tiers of local government in respect of agriculture and \nallied sectors; (ii) industries and poverty reduction; (iii) ignorance of the roles of different state \ngovernment departments in relation to local governments; (iv) heads of departments in the \nKerala government not willing to relinquish responsibilities to local governments; (v) continued \nexistence  of  parallel  structures  such  as  development  authorities;  (vi)  existence  of  parallel \nschemes, especially of the Agriculture Department; (vii) functional overlaps between the rural \ndevelopment and LSG departments; and (viii) delays in implementing the recommendations of \nthe Second State Finance Commission. \n \n31.  In response to the comprehensive analysis of problems facing local government, the \nKerala government has set up a special task team in MGP to develop and implement a project \nto support the institutionalization of the local government system. The task team has developed \na  strategic  implementation  plan  through  support  provided  by  the  Government  of  the \nNetherlands. The State Planning Board has also made a number of recommendations that the \nKerala government recently approved, concerned with institutionalizing the system of local \ngovernment. The resulting LSG action plan is key to the Program. The Swiss and Netherlands \ngovernments are helping build local government capacity, and the World Bank is funding \nresearch to look at the wider issue of sustainable fiscal decentralization.  \n \n   \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  37 \nG.  Kerala Government Reform Achievements  \n \n32.  Since  the  publication  of  the  White  Paper  on  State  Finances  in 2001, the Kerala \ngovernment has taken a number of measures to address the fiscal crisis and begin reform. The \nMGP steering committee, chaired by the chief secretary, was constituted in January 2002, and a \nfull-time MGP secretary was appointed to coordinate and manage the Program. A high-powered \ncommittee  is  developing  a  reform  package  for  the  power  sector,  and  a  committee  was \nestablished in early 2002 to promote economic development. An investors\u2019 meeting is planned \nfor January 2003, raising awareness of the private sector to business opportunities in Kerala. \nThe pilot project on \"bridging the digital divide\" is an initiative being implemented by the Kerala \ngovernment in partnership with the private sector in Mallapurram district. The objective of the \nproject is to improve IT literacy by having a structured capacity-building program to ensure that \nat least one member of every family in the state is able to send and receive electronic mail and \nto be able to use word processing and other basic IT tools. The other target is to ensure Internet \naccess within a radius of 2 kilometers for all families. A unique feature of the project is the major \nrole of the private sector and the minimal investment from the state government.   \n \n33.  Fiscal Management. The Kerala government has been able to reduce the ratio of \nconsolidated revenue deficits to revenue receipts by more than 17% during FY2001. The Kerala \ngovernment has received the incentive fund from the central Government (as per the letter of \nshared fiscal goals and objectives) under the Medium-Term Fiscal Reform Facility. No new \nposts have been created, and 55 schools that have few learners and meet the closure criteria \nhave been closed. The surrender of earned leave facility has been canceled and pension dues \nhave been reduced through a reworking of the commutation formula. The surplus staff initiative \nhas identified 17,000 surplus staff, and a net attrition rate of 1% has been maintained for the \npast year. Government orders have been issued for not sanctioning any new aided educational \ninstitutions  and  for  freezing  expansion  of  state-run  and  aided  schools.  Higher  technical \neducation, including medical education, has been opened up for the private sector.  \n \n34.  Revenue Mobilization. The Kerala government has taken several steps to augment tax \ncollection, including (i) rationalization and simplification of tax structure; (ii) improvement and \nenhancement of tax compliance; (iii) faster disposal of appeals; (iv) speedy disposal of pending \ncases; (v) withdrawal of absolute stays granted by the Kerala government; (vi) computerization \nof revenue collection systems; (vii) periodic revision of user charges, and (viii) mobilization of \nnational savings. The draft bill for levying a VAT, scheduled to be introduced in the Assembly in \nDecember 2002, will reduce the number of stages of appeal in tax dispute adjudication. \n \n35.  Power Sector. The Kerala government has established a State Electricity Regulatory \nCommission. A tariff hike was announced in early October 2002, estimated to reduce KSEB\u2019s \nmonthly cash flow deficit by Rs350 million. \n \n36.  Other Reforms. A program to reform the State Transport Corporation was initiated, and \nthe Corporation's monthly losses have been reduced. An interim report from the law reform \ninitiative proposing repeal of 82 laws has been submitted for public comment. A draft bill on the \nright to information is being vetted by the Law Department, and a combination of measures \nreflected in the new IT, industrial, and labor policies is designed to improve the enabling \nenvironment for private sector investment.  \n \n37.  Local  Self-Governments.  The  Council  of  Ministers  has  approved  a  campaign  to \nstrengthen LSGs, particularly by improving the function of Grama Sabhas and making elected \nheads and secretaries of LSGs accountable for service delivery through citizens\u2019 charters and ", "38  Appendix 1 \nsocial audit. The antipoverty subplan policy was initiated in the State's Tenth Five-Year Plan, \nand specific measures have been introduced to strengthen the planning processes in LSGs: \n \n(i)  introducing  the 5-year planning system; \n(ii)  allowing  LSGs  to  utilize  up  to  10%  of  the  funds  allocated  by  the  Kerala \ngovernment for asset renewal in respect of schools, hospitals, and rural water \nsupply systems; \n(iii)  defining  through  consultation  the  minimum  standards  for  infrastructure  and \nservices for hospitals, schools, and anganwadis; and  \n(iv)  incorporating spatial planning aspects, especially while deciding plans for new \nroads. \n \n38.  Kerala Government Communications Strategy. A communications strategy has been \nprepared to improve awareness and foster a better understanding of the Kerala government's \nreform  plan.  The  strategy  will  comprise  awareness  building,  analysis,  and  debate.  The \ncampaign will increase information levels, disseminate material regarding the Program, and \nstimulate debate and analysis at all levels of civil society. A series of articles will be placed in all \nmajor newspapers (Malayalam and English) in the state. At least four articles will each deal with \none aspect of importance or concern, followed by comments and opinions by leading academics \nand social scientists regarding the Program. To ensure that basic comprehensive information on \nthe  Program  is  available,  booklets  and  brochures  will  be  published  on  MGP's  various \ncomponents. Other media such as radio and television, as well as seminars and meetings, will \nalso be used. \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  39 \nCHRONOLOGY OF PROCESSING STEPS \n \nDate  Event \n15 October 1998  Concept  paper  requesting  the  Asian  Development Bank (ADB) support \nsubmitted by the Kerala government to the central Government, outlining \nareas  for  change:  public  finance,  state-level public enterprises (SLPEs), \npower  sector,  road  sector,  decentralized  planning,  and  administrative \nreforms \n   \n10 February 2000  ADB Consultation Mission to Kerala and selection of Kerala as the third focal \nstate \n   \nJuly 2000  Proposal from the Kerala government to ADB on technical assistance (TA) to \nsupport state public finance and public enterprise reform \n   \n24 July 2000  ADB TA Fact-Finding Mission for public resource management \n   \nAugust 2000  Kerala Administrative Reforms Committee report \n   \n13 December 2000  Approval of $1 million for TA 3576: Supporting Fiscal Reforms in Kerala \n   \nJanuary 2001  Second State Finance Commission report \n   \n15 March 2001  Central  Government's  states\u2019  fiscal  reform  facility,  based  on \nrecommendations of the National Eleventh Finance Commission \n   \nMay 2001  New coalition government in Kerala \n   \nJune 2001  White Paper on State Finances of Kerala \n   \nAugust 2001  Memorandum of Understanding between the central Government's Ministry \nof Power and the Kerala government  \n   \n4 November 2001  ADB  Loan  Reconnaissance  Mission,  joined  by  the  Government  of  the \nNetherlands \n   \n10 November 2001  Interactive session between ADB, the Government of the Netherlands, and \nkey organizations in industry, in Kochi, Kerala \n   \n11 November 2001  The Kerala government order establishing the enterprise reform committee \n(ERC) to restructure SLPEs \n   \nJanuary 2002  Modernizing Government Program (MGP) steering committee established \n   \nFebruary 2002  ADB MGP Design Mission; MGP task teams established  \n   \nFebruary 2002  Kerala: Tenth Five-Year Plan, 2002\u20132007 \n   \nFebruary 2002  Letter on Shared Fiscal Goals and Objectives agreed between the Kerala \ngovernment and central Government's Department of Expenditure  \n   \n14 February 2002  MGP steering committee and MGP expert group preliminary workshop \n   \n20 March 2002  ERC approach paper for SLPE reforms in Kerala  \n   ", "40  Appendix 2 \nDate  Event \n15 April\u201301 May 2002   ADB  Fact-Finding  Mission,  part  1;  joined  by  the  Government  of  the \nNetherlands \n   \n22 April 2002  Workshop on modernizing government  \n   \nApril 2002  State of India\u2019s Services: Benchmarks for the New Millennium (a study by the \n  Public Affairs Center, Bangalore) \n   \nApril 2002  MGP Strategy Document published on the Kerala government web site \n   \n23 May 2002  Small-Scale  TA:  Participative  and  Pro-poor  Fiscal  and  Administrative \nReforms in Kerala, approved \n   \n23 May 2002  Small-Scale  TA:  Strengthening  State  Government  Effectiveness  and \nEfficiency, Kerala, approved \n   \n15\u201320 July 2002  Fact-Finding Mission, part 2; joined by the Government of the Netherlands \n   \n17 July 2002  Presentation of SLPE study by consultants \n   \n12\u201313 August 2002  Local self-government diagnostics workshop, with ADB participation \n   \n12\u201313 August 2002  Poverty Eradication Mission (Kudumbashree) workshop  \n   \n13 August 2002  Participatory poverty assessment: Presentation of findings by consultants to \nthe Kerala government \n   \n23 September\u201311  Appraisal \nOctober 2002 \n \n ", "  Appendix 3  41 \nSUMMARY OF BACKGROUND STUDIES \n \n1.

ASSESSMENT \n \nThis report\u2014in the form of a narrative and matrixes\u2014presents a preliminary assessment \nof the nature and magnitude of the likely impact on the poor of the reforms proposed under the \nprogram loan. The changing  poverty situation resulting from each component of the reform \nprogram needs to be studied to assess the full impact in the short-run as well as in the medium \nrun.1 \n \nA.  The Policy Issues \n \n1.  Kerala is well known for its high levels of literacy, especially among females, and low \ninfant mortality (12 per 1,000 live births in 1997). Such achievements are thought to be made \npossible through \"public action promoting a range of social opportunities relating inter alia to \nelementary education, land reforms, role of women in society, and widespread and equitable \nprovision of health care and other public services.\"2 While the poverty level was comparable to \nthe all-India level until the early 1980s, reduction since then has been rapid, reaching 13% in \nFY2000. \n \n2.  Kerala, with a per capita gross state domestic product (GSDP) of $450 , has done well in \neconomic growth during the last 30 years compared to many other states, but its progress has \nnot been commensurate with the high human capabilities built over the years. This growth has \nlargely been led by the tertiary sector, the share in GSDP of which increased from 32% in \nFY1971to 58% in FY2001.3 The share of the secondary sector has shown hardly any change \nand remains around 21%. The rapid growth of the tertiary sector has been beneficial to the \npoor, and studies4 show that higher farm yields, higher state development spending, higher \nnonfarm output, and lower inflation all reduced poverty. Nonfarm output alone had differential \nelasticities across the states, and substantially higher elasticity for Kerala. Urbanization in an \narea will reflect the higher nonfarm growth, and the poor are expected to gain when they live in \na more urbanized area. Kerala is not highly urbanized. Over 40 years the level of urbanization \nhas increased from 15% to 26%, with the bulk of the increase taking place during 1981\u20131991. \nThe most urbanized districts have over two thirds of the main workers in the nonprimary sector, \nand the least urbanized districts have less than one fourth in the nonprimary sector.  \n \n3.  In Kerala the dependence of scheduled caste and scheduled tribes on agriculture is \nmuch higher than in many other states. The proportions overall  become very low for the \nscheduled tribe population, and the relationship has also become very weak with urbanization. It \nis evident that while scheduled caste population is able to take advantage of urbanization, to \nsome extent scheduled tribe population is not. Districts with large numbers of scheduled tribe \nare the least urbanized and have shown practically no urban growth over the last 40 years.5 \n \n4.  The lower urbanization and poor nonfarm growth in many districts have gone along with \npoor access to some of the basic services by the poor and higher dependence on agricultural \nlabor. The least urbanized districts have a higher proportion of poor families dependent on \n                                                 \n1 Centre for Development Studies, Thiruvananthapuram. \n2  Dreze, Jean and Amartya Sen. 1995.

A much higher proportion of poor households in the northern districts do not have \nelectricity. While close to 50% of households below the poverty line in the districts south of \nThrissur  (except  Idukki  and  Pathanamthitta)  have  electricity,  the  proportion  of  houses  with \nelectricity  is  less  than  35%  in  most  northern  districts.  Despite  efforts  at  equitable  public \nprovision, inequalities are strikingly high in Kerala.  \n \n5.  The massive public spending for public provision of services and production activities in \nthe public sector, and poor returns have led to fiscal stress in Kerala since the 1980s. The \nKerala  government\u2019s  revenue  account  registered  deficits,  and  development  and  revenue \nexpenditures had to be financed by borrowing. By the late 1990s, Kerala had high debt-to-\nGSDP ratio, numerous infrastructure projects in the public sector were incomplete for many \nyears, existing infrastructure was not maintained, state-level public enterprises (SLPEs) were \ndraining government resources, an inefficient Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) was heavily \ndependent on government resources for survival, and public administration was unresponsive. \nOne bold policy initiative taken in Kerala following the 73rd and 74th amendments to the Indian \nConstitution was decentralization. One third of the plan funds were devolved to local self-\ngovernments  (LSGs),  many  sectors  were  brought  under  their  administrative  control  and \nmandated to carry out local planning for social justice. This, too, was left in limbo by the \nincomplete transfer of powers, budgets, and personnel to the LSGs for some time. \n \n6.  The external debt crisis of 1991 led India to adopt an adjustment program, which sought \nto bring down the fiscal deficit by reducing subsidies and support for public sector enterprises \nand infrastructure projects, and by curtailing unproductive expenditure. The reforms at the state \nlevel focused on sales tax administration, property tax, expenditure cuts, and SLPEs. Three \nsectors (power, health care, and LSGs) have come under major reform efforts in at least some \nof the states following the adjustment program. \n \n7.  Given the crisis within the Kerala government and the larger reform environment outside, \nthe state was faced with the following issues: \n  \n(i)  Should the Kerala government continue with the numerous functions, beyond the \ngovernance and developmental functions, entailing huge financial liabilities? \n(ii)  Should  the  Kerala  government  carry  out  functions  in  the  conventional  way, \nentailing huge costs and breeding inefficiencies? \n(iii)  How  to  take  advantage  of  the  environment  created  by  the  constitutional \namendments for decentralization of governance and development? \n(iv)  How to carry out the poverty reduction and social security programs efficiently? \n \n8.  The Kerala government drew up the Modernizing Government Program (MGP) to make \nthe state a model of good governance that would be fully responsive to the needs of a modern, \nmarket-oriented economy and democratic society. \n \nB.  Modernizing Government Program and Policy Orientation  \n \n9.  One  of  the  major  objectives  of  MGP  is  to  bring  down  the  Kerala  government\u2019s \nexpenditures and make them more efficient and effective so that larger social gains accrue over \nthe long run. Policies may be categorized under four broad headings: \n \n(i)  reducing liabilities of the Kerala government; \n(ii)  making government spending more productive and efficient; \n(iii)  targeting  poverty reduction and making it more efficient; and ", "68  Appendix 6 \n(iv)  maximizing revenue receipts. \n \n10.  While all policy measures essentially serve the larger goal, how it is achieved is critical \nfor the level of acceptance of policy. For instance, power sector reforms are arrived at on the \nbasis of agreements signed between the central and Kerala governments; SLPE reforms are \narrived at on the basis of an approach paper, which takes into account the various dimensions \nof the problem and analysis; and surplus staff identification and redeployment have their basis \nin the administrative reforms committee's deliberations and reports. However, such approach \npapers or detailed studies do not necessarily support policy measures such as the new budget \ncycle. Sensitization of the different administrative departments to the modalities of new budget \npreparation at one level is needed, and policy statements for the different sectors at another \nlevel.  \n \na The Kerala Government\u2019s Initiative. The budget and expenditure reform component of \nMGP will be implemented in all departments, including the Secretariat. One of the main \nfeatures of the new budget and expenditure management system is to give departments a \ngreater degree of flexibility to determine priorities within a resource envelope that is made \navailable before budget preparation.   \n \n11.  Termination of infrastructure projects over 5 years old per se may lack economic logic. \nMere  delay  cannot  justify  closing  down  a  project.  In  developing  the  criteria  for  closing \ninfrastructure projects, the sector policy should be considered. Economic considerations need to \nbe incorporated in administrative decisions regarding the future of incomplete infrastructure \nprojects. \n \na The Kerala Government\u2019s Initiative. The infrastructure policy document has gone some \nway to taking care of the concerns raised through the inclusion of specific criteria to support \nidentification and evaluation.  Criteria will be expanded and made specific during the course \nof developing sector specific guidelines.  \n \n12.  The lack of a sector policy is glaring. While the need for the Kerala government to \nconfine itself to core functions is thought through, service delivery as incorporated in the policy \nmatrix is too broad, and the specificity of sectors and the problems arising therein have not been \nanalyzed.  Two  major  problems  of  the  health  sector,  for  example,  are  the  highly  unequal \ndistribution of public health care facilities across districts, and the distinction between \u201cdelivery \nof services\u201d and \u201caccess to services.\u201d Distribution inequality is serious enough to affect access \nto secondary health care services. Equalization might require vast resources, which are not \navailable.  \n \na The  Kerala  Government\u2019s  Initiative.  The  Kerala  Government  does  have  a   \ncomprehensive sectoral policy covering both economic and social development. This sector \npolicy is the Tenth Five Year Plan of Kerala which has a strong poverty reduction and health \nfocus as noted in the Development Policy Letter. The Kerala government has started work \non a sector policy for health, and health care initiatives in MGP are envisaged to inform the \nsector-wide approach for health. The Kerala government also wishes to develop a water \npolicy but is constrained by lack of resources and competing priorities.   \n \n13.  Another way of providing services is to incorporate the private health care sector into the \nsystem. For example, people may use the services of private facilities wherever they are easily \naccessible, and the local Panchayat may reimburse the cost of treatment. Such an attempt \nwould fit in with one a principle guiding resource transfer to LSGs. The basic principle that ", "  Appendix 6  69 \nshould guide the design of a system of intergovernmental transfers is not to finance particular \ngovernment entities but rather to contribute to effective provision of services.6 The question is \nespecially relevant because in Kerala, close to 70% of population access private health care \nservices, and even the very poor pay for services, with a small percentage of the patients \ntreated for free. Expenditure is high.  \n \na The Kerala Government\u2019s Initiative. The Kerala government is considering a system of \nequalizing the grants to LSGs in health, education, and water supply, and a study is being \ncommissioned through the decentralization support program to inform the development of \nthe new policy.  \n \n14.  Unlike power sector reform and SLPE reform, which have largely come from sector \nanalysis, the reforms of the second category seem to be percolating down from the level of \nmacro  expenditure  control.  Such  an  approach  raises  a  question:  Should  public  sector \nexpenditure reform begin at the macro level and percolate down to the sectors, or should it \nbegin at the sector level? If the policy goal is a better allocation of scarce resources among and \nwithin sectors, then reform needs to begin at the sector level. \n \na The Kerala Government\u2019s Initiative. The public expenditure-tracking survey envisaged in \nthe service delivery policy for the sectors in subprogram 2 should allow for a micro-level \nanalysis of sector-related expenditure to inform budget and expenditure management.   \n \n15.  Two  major  initiatives  under  MGP\u2014strengthening  LSGs  and  the  poverty  reduction \nprogram\u2014do not seem to be subject to the policy lacunae mentioned above. The measures \nproposed for strengthening LSGs are founded on the recommendations of the Sen Committee \nand the Second State Finance Commission. The poverty reduction programs are guided by the \nresearch and analysis at various levels, and the numerous initiatives at the micro level in the \nstate. \n \nC.  Reform of State-Level Public Enterprises and Kerala State Electricity Board  \n \n16.  From the angle of the amount of the program loan going to different sectors, reforms of \nSLPEs and KSEB deserve emphasis. Kerala has the largest number of SLPEs in India (111 out \nof 1,071), employing about 125,000 people. While the 63 manufacturing SLPEs employ 53,270 \npersons,  22,234  are  employed  in  the  three  traditional  industries\u2014cashew,  coir,  and \nhandlooms\u2014and  8,850  are  in  the  nonmanufacturing  plantation  and  agro-industries.  Most \nenterprises impose a huge burden on the exchequer as they are making losses. SLPE reform is \ntherefore motivated by the need to redirect resources from the sector where the net social return \nis negative to sectors with high positive social benefits, such as poverty reduction and human \ndevelopment.  \n \n17.  SLPE reforms do not have any fundamental conflict with the goal of poverty reduction, \neven though a separated public sector worker most likely experiences a welfare loss. SLPE \nreforms as envisaged by the Kerala government involve considerable spending in the short run \nto reap benefits in the long run. The decision to undertake such reforms should be analyzed \nwithin the framework of cost-benefit analysis. However, the approach implicit in the stated policy \n                                                 \n6\n Bird, Richard M., and Ariel Fiszbein. 1998.  Colombia: the Central Role of the Central Government in Fiscal \nDecentralisation. In Bird and Vaillancourt (eds.). Fiscal Decentralization in Developing Countries. Cambridge: \nCambridge University Press.  \n ", "70  Appendix 6 \ngoals seems to focus narrowly on returns from the financial point of view\u2014on the impact of \nreforms on the budget deficit. This is indeed important, since SLPE reform is part of a broader \nadjustment program. However, the decision should also consider the net benefits of reforms, \nthat is, their impact on aggregate welfare and poverty. The overall assessment of SLPE reforms \nshould depend on whether financial or net social returns are used.  \n \n18.  Although the broad guidelines for SLPE reform have been outlined in the approach \npaper,7 they do not address the issues specific to the enterprises that deal with plantation and \ntraditional  industries.  The  enterprise  reform  committee  (ERC)  proposes  to  take  these  up \nsubsequently. The case-by-case detailed proposals for units to be taken up for reforms are also \nyet to be completed. To assess the possible impact of such reforms on the poor, it is necessary \nto have these details. Although SLPEs in Kerala are generally spread over the entire state, their \nimportance may vary depending on their location. SLPE reforms may affect the rest of the \neconomy not only through their fiscal impact, but also through their impact on private sector \noutput and employment. A drastic reduction in employment in a public sector unit with a large \nshare of jobs in a particular region is likely to curtail private sector activity there.  \n \n19.  On closer scrutiny this production externality argument appears weak in a number of \ncases, which the ERC has already identified. To illustrate, Autokast and Kerala State Drugs and \nPharmaceuticals together received Rs65 million from the Kerala government soon after the \ndisinvestment policy was announced in 1991. These two enterprises are in Alappuzha district \nand together have only about 600 employees. The approach paper rightly notes that such a \nhuge amount would have made substantial welfare impact in a district like Alappuzha if it had \nbeen spent judiciously on several sectors. \n \n20.  The ERC\u2019s proposal to implement reforms in phases, focusing on 10\u201315 units in a phase \n(year), is likely to spread out thinly over a long stretch of time whatever production externality \neffect reforms might have. In this context, development of a comprehensive set of criteria for \nprioritization would be of crucial importance. Overall, restructuring and closure of SLPEs like \nKerala State Drugs and Pharmaceuticals or Autokast will have no adverse impact on the poor \noutside of these firms. However, most employees will be worse off even with a \u201cgenerous\u201d \nvoluntary retirement scheme (VRS) package. Particularly vulnerable groups would be those who \nare likely to fall into the poverty trap as a result of poor health, which is expensive to treat as the \nbenefits such as the Employees\u2019 State Insurance will no longer be available. A comprehensive \nsocial safety net (SSN) is needed. Although it shows great care and sensitivity to the complexity \nof SLPE reforms, the ERC approach paper has not visited SSN issues.  \n  \n21.  The goal of making KSEB financially self-sufficient, which  would necessarily require \ndrastic reduction in subsidy to different categories of consumers, will not have adverse impact \non the poor, simply because the bulk of the subsidy now goes to the nonpoor. An analysis of the \nconsumption pattern of electricity and the subsidy received through the current tariff structure by \ndifferent income groups in Kerala shows it is the middle class, not the poor, that stands to lose \nfrom any move toward cost recovery.8 About half the total power sold by KSEB goes to \ndomestic consumers. Those who consume up to 20 units receive a very small share of the total \nsubsidy.  Nearly  40%  of  households  do  not  have  electricity  connections,  and  most  poor \nhouseholds belong to this group. The progress of providing new connections, which is expected \n                                                 \n7 Enterprises Reform Committee. 2002. Approach Paper for State Level Public Enterprise Reforms in Kerala. \nGovernment of Kerala. \n8 This section heavily draws on a recent study by V. Santhakumar. The Impact of Costs and Benefits of Non-Reform \non the Politics of Reform: A Case Study of Power Sector Reforms in Kerala between 1996 and 2000. Paper \npresented at the seminar for The Politics of Economic Reform in India, Hyderabad, April 2002.  ", "  Appendix 6  71 \nto benefit this group, has been such that even after 10 years about a quarter of all households \nwill remain unconnected. Although KSEB reform is necessary for faster connection, reform does \nnot guarantee it. Much will depend on how fine-tuned the tariff structure can be made so that the \npoor bear the least of the burden of cost recovery. Otherwise, even though KSEB may be more \nefficient after reform, the poor may still find electricity connections beyond their means.  \n \n22.  Thus, KSEB and SLPE reform, which account for a significant proportion of the cost of \nthe program loan, do not have a major adverse impact on the poor. One of the initiatives under \nthe  Medium-Term  Fiscal  Framework\u2014to  curtail  the  total  government  expenditure\u2014will \nadversely affect the poor. Such adverse impact is strongly mitigated by two comprehensive \ninitiatives as part of MGP: the LSG action plan and antipoverty measures. The channels of \npoverty impact have been worked out in the poverty impact matrixes (1.1 to 1.6). MGP and \nfiscal reforms, including power sector reforms, will not have an adverse impact on environment \nor lead to any involuntary resettlement problems, nor trigger the Asian Development Bank\u2019s \ninvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples  policies. Improved efficiency of government \ndepartments following MGP and decentralization might help implement existing stringent laws \nagainst environmental pollution and land degradation.    \n \n23.  The impact of the reform on women will be diverse. SLPE reform might have an adverse \nimpact on women in some regions and some sectors, but overall the resources released should \nbe  beneficial  to  women.  Similarly,  the  poverty  reduction  schemes  and,  in  particular,  the \nKudumbasree and microcredit will benefit poor women.  \n \nD.  Suggestions on How to Carry Out Poverty and Social Analysis in Kerala \n \n24.  The impact of the proposed reforms has been assessed within the framework of the \npoverty impact assessment matrix, which is a limited exercise, since the conclusions have been \ndrawn on the basis of limited data and various earlier studies conducted for a variety of \npurposes. A seemingly more rigorous approach such as a computable general equilibrium \nmodeling, assuming that the necessary inputs for such an exercise were available, would also \nbe of limited use. The matrix at least throws some light on the nature of the trade-off between \nshort-term adverse effects and medium-term likely improvements.  \n \n25.  The probable impact of reforms on the poor in the short run and how poverty develops \nover  time  will  depend  on  a  number  of  factors,  the  most  crucial  factor  of  which  is  the \neffectiveness of SSNs. Changing poverty resulting from each component of the reform program, \nwhich includes the mitigating measures, thus needs to be studied to assess the full impact in the \nshort and medium term. \n \n26.  The most important indicator for assessing poverty situation is income or consumption \nexpenditure. The percentage of people below the poverty line is estimated on the basis of the \nlarge-scale sample surveys of household consumption expenditure conducted periodically by \nthe National Sample Survey Organization. This data set can be used to estimate poverty rates \nonly on a broad aggregate level. At the local level, data on income poverty is nonexistent, \nresulting in various proxies being suggested. Poverty is generally defined in terms of multiple \ndimensions where the indicators range from asset holding or access to public services to school \nenrollment rate. The effects of a VRS or a one-time settlement cannot be assessed in the short \nrun by looking at withdrawal of children from school if education remains subsidized. Thus, a \nframework must be designed for impact analysis, taking into account the specificity of the \nprogram as well as the regional context.  \n ", "72  Appendix 6 \n27.  In Kerala, unlike in other Indian states, individuals and households almost equally share \ncertain human development indicators across various income classes. The major impact on the \npoor is likely to be through changes in income-earning opportunities. Therefore, income remains \nthe most important indicator, at least in the short and medium run. But reliable income data is \ncostly to collect. Proxies are thus needed, and the benefit from using them has to be assessed \nin relation to the cost and benefit of using the original. If most of the proxies are very imperfectly \ncorrelated with the original, the original has to be used in spite of the high cost. Average number \nof days of employment along with real wages in certain main occupations, or some other \nindicators, may provide a good idea about income. A rigorous exercise is needed at the outset \nto identify indicators that are the best proxies of income poverty in Kerala. \n \n28.  It  is  possible  to  combine  various  indicators  to  form  a  suitable  poverty  and  social \nmonitoring  system.  Various  government  and  nongovernment  agencies  and  individual \nresearchers  have  made  numerous  attempts  to  do  so.  The  state\u2019s  Rural  Development \nDepartment recently collected data on a number of indicators at the household level to identify \nhouseholds below the poverty line. The success of this massive effort is mixed, because \nadequate safeguards to minimize systematic misreporting were not built into the implementation \ndesign.

Multiyear fiscal projections reflecting the program policy measures have been prepared \nin consultation with the Kerala government. These projections will form inputs into the Kerala \ngovernment\u2019s FY2004 budget in the context of the medium-term fiscal framework for fiscal \nconsolidation. The reform scenario projections though FY2005 integrate the impact of the \nsubstantive adjustment costs associated with the Program, estimates of future deficits for the \nKerala State Electricity Board under independent regulatory supervision, and outlays to mitigate \nsocial impact of the adjustment program, including remedial operation and maintenance and \nremedial capital expenditures for social infrastructure. \n \n2.  Program projections achieve (i) stabilization of the debt-to-gross state domestic product \n(GSDP) ratio and the state debt, plus power sector debt-to-GSDP ratio over the medium term; \n(ii) a gradual decrease in revenue deficit to 1.46% of GSDP by FY2005; and (iii) a consistent \nimprovement in the primary balance leading to a primary surplus, starting in FY2004. The \nprimary  balance  (deficit/surplus)  measures  how  current  actions  improve  or  worsen  Kerala \ngovernment\u2019s  net  indebtedness,  and  is  an  important  fiscal  indicator  for  evaluating  the \nsustainability of government deficits. Although a fiscal deficit can be run indefinitely, the primary \nbalance should eventually become positive under prudent macroeconomic assumptions to \nensure that the primary surplus covers at least part of the interest on debt. \n \n3.  The fiscal aspects of the Program focus on (i) consolidation of the public finances \nthrough revenue enhancement, notably by adopting a VAT; (ii) improvement in the \u201cquality\u201d of \nthe fiscal balance by focusing on the composition of fiscal adjustment, including increased \nborrowing through additional central assistance channels tied to expenditures for capital outlays \nand repair and maintenance; (iii) a minimum 1% rate of net attrition in consolidated employment \nlevels for civil servants and teachers over the term of the projections; (iv) a transparent subsidy \ndue to the State Electricity Board  during transition to full cost recovery under a tariff-setting \nregime  with  an  independent  regulator;  and  (v)  identification  of  wasteful  expenditures  and \nnonmerit subsidies during subprogram 1 and substantial reduction of nonmerit subsidies with \nbetter targeting in subprogram 2. \n \n4.  The Program\u2019s fiscal aspects also reflect reversal of the compression of capital outlays \nof earlier years, in part reflecting outlays associated with the asset renewal fund. Policy on \nwinding up infrastructure projects that do not meet criteria for continuation will provide fiscal \nspace  to  enhance  efficiency  of  capital  spending.  Increased  resource  mobilization  will  be \nachieved over the medium term through improvement in buoyancy of the value-added tax, \nstamp duty, and property tax; strengthening of tax administration; and improvements in cost \nrecovery for key own nontax revenue components with the nontax improvement being realized \nin FY2005 after the Kerala government reviews its policies and administrative procedures for \nuser fee levying and collection.  \n \n5.  The projections are based on prudent macroeconomic growth assumptions that reflect \nrecent trends in all-India inflation and the trend in real growth rate of the Kerala economy. The \nprojections assume that nominal growth rate is 9.0% in FY2003 and subsequent years. Inflation \nis assumed to remain in the 3\u20134% range, lowering the dearness  allowance (cost of living \nadjustments to the wage bill) and pension rate increases, both indexed for inflation. A 1% net \nattrition rate, as announced by the Kerala government in its Letter of Shared Fiscal Goals and \nObjectives addressed to the central Government, is assumed to be in place for the entire \nprojection period, and average per employee compensation is assumed to increase by 5% per \nannum. All-India nominal growth rate is 10%. The average cost of borrowing for the Kerala ", "78  Appendix 7 \ngovernment is assumed to be 9% from FY2004 although incremental borrowing costs have \nrecently been noticeably below that level. The debt assumed by the Kerala government as a \nresult of its tripartite agreement on power sector has been integrated into state\u2019s debt stock.  \n \n6.  The reform table also reports projections for a single indicator, which can be monitored, \nproposed by the central Government to evaluate overall reduction in fiscal stress by capturing \nkey  off-budget  impacts  under  the  central  Government\u2019s  fiscal  reform  facility.  Rather  than \nfocusing on the current or revenue account balance from the budget expressed as a ratio of \ntotal revenue receipts, this single indicator is the sum of the revenue receipts, deficit of the SEB, \nand the interest on off-budget guarantees, expressed as a ratio of state\u2019s revenue receipts.  \n ", "  Appendix 7  79 \n \nKerala Government Operations and Medium-Term Fiscal Framework \n(% of GSDP) \n \n  FY2001 FY2002 FY2003 FY2004 FY2005\nRevenue Receipts (RR)  12.30 11.66 12.24  12.70 12.94\n    State own Tax Revenues  8.27 7.62 7.87  8.12 8.38\n    Non Tax Revenue  0.93 0.70 0.77  0.84 0.92\n    Resources from the central Government  3.10 3.33 3.29  3.24 3.20\n    Grant Portion of Externally Assisted Projects   0.00 0.00 0.32  0.50 0.44\nRevenue Expenditure  16.74 15.01 14.80  14.60 14.40\nOf which:   \n    Interest  3.18 3.20 3.24  3.25 3.21\n     Wages and Salaries  6.63 6.03 5.78  5.55 5.32\n     Pensions and Retirement   2.72 2.37 2.14  2.05 1.97\n     Devolution to local self-governments  1.94 1.79 1.53  1.40 1.27\n     Of which: Non Revenue & Balance Sheet  \n     Clearing Components of Adjustment Costs      0.77  0.63 0.45\nRevenue Deficit   (4.44) (3.35) (2.56)  (1.90) (1.46)\nCapital Expenditure  0.81 0.72 0.79  0.86 0.95\nFiscal Deficit  5.47 4.21 3.35  2.77 2.41\nPrimary (Deficit)/Surplus   (2.50) (1.20) (0.14)  0.70 1.26\nTotal Debt Stock  36.24 37.36 37.47  36.98 36.18\nInterest on outstanding guarantees  1.16 1.15 1.15  1.14 1.14\nConsolidated Revenue Deficit (CRD)a  (7.41) (5.20) (4.77)  (3.53) (2.82)\nConsolidated Interest (interest on debt and on   4.34 4.36 4.39  4.39 4.35\n     outstanding guarantees)   \nMemo Items:    \nSalary + Pension + Interest  12.53 11.60 11.16  10.85 10.49\nOff-budget borrowings (Guarantees)   11.87 15.21 15.00  14.80 14.59\nConsolidated Debt Stock with Guarantees   48.11 52.57 52.47  51.78 50.77\nMonitored Fiscal Indicator CRD/RR  .50 .40 .38  .30 .26\na CRD is equivalent to the sum of revenue deficit, interest on outstanding guarantees and the    \n                 deficit of KSEB. \n            Source: Revised Medium Term Fiscal Framework, Kerala government. \n           \n \n \n \n \n ", "80  Appendix 8 \nINELIGIBLE ITEMS \n \n1.

The Program will be implemented by the Kerala government through an institutional \narrangement for reform, which was identified during the design of the Modernizing Government \nProgram (MGP), including reform of the power sector and state-level public enterprises. The \nProgram  will  be  underpinned  by  a  performance  measurement  system  that  will  track  the \nperformance of key results areas of the Program in a meaningful and transparent manner. The \nperformance  indicators  will  comprise  input  and  output  and  process  indicators,  and  cover \nsubprograms 1 and 2. The starting point for tracking performance will be the items in the policy \nmatrix, which are also reflected in the program framework. However, as the Kerala government \ndevelops its capacity to monitor performance, the system will be enhanced to capture a wider \nrange of indicators, including outcome indicators. Measures to monitor benefits will focus on \nservice delivery improvements and access to information by the public, including monitoring by \nrepresentatives of civil-society organizations.  \n \n2.  The  aim  of  performance  measurement  is  to  improve  public  services,  reinforce \naccountability, and underpin effective working practices in the Kerala government and local self-\ngovernments (LSGs). A performance measurement system will be established for the various \nprojects in the Program by the project teams in consultation with relevant stakeholders. The \nKerala government will receive technical assistance from the Government of the Netherlands to \ndesign and implement such a performance monitoring system.  \n \n3.  The system will be designed for use in a variety of organizational settings, ranging from \nthe Secretariat to LSGs. However, the consistent reporting cycle and reporting format will allow \nfor  consolidation  and  comparison.  Performance  measures,  targets,  and  systems  will  be \ndesigned and implemented by line departments and LSGs. Project-based performance reports \nwill be submitted via the MGP secretary to the MGP steering committee for approval. Once \ncleared by the steering committee, they will be submitted to the MGP Cabinet subcommittee. All \nperformance reports will be published on the Kerala government web page. \n \n4.  The  performance  measures  will  have  several  audiences,  each  with  their  own \nrequirements,  such  as  the  general  public,  MGP  steering  committee,  MGP  Cabinet \nsubcommittee, and departmental and LSG heads. \n \n5.  The underlying principles that the Kerala government will have to bear in mind in \ndesigning an effective performance measurement system are that it must (i) have clarity of \npurpose, (ii) focus on the priority areas for improvement, (iii) have a balanced number of \nmeasures, (iv) be owned by the staff responsible for collecting and analyzing the data, (v) be \nscrutinized at a number of levels to challenge the focus and to ensure the robustness of the \ndata, (vi) have systems of performance evolve over time and adapt to changing circumstances. \nand (vii) have measures for regular monitoring and reviews.  \n \n6.  The performance measures will be purposeful, clearly defined, and easy to interpret. In \nchoosing  measures,  consideration  will  be  given  to  measures  of  economy,  efficiency, \neffectiveness, quality, and value for money. Targets should be time specific, incorporate an \nelement  of  comparison,  and  be  realistic.  These  considerations  are  often  summarized  as \n\"SMART\"\u2014specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and timed. Central direction may be \nvaluable to ensure that valid comparisons can be made, but local discretion should also be \nallowed to ensure that targets are set at a level appropriate to the organization.  \n ", "  Appendix 10  83 \n7.  To ensure that the performance system is implemented in a phased manner, high-\npriority areas for change must be identified, and the policy matrix will provide some direction in \nthis regard. The Kerala government will need to consider how progress monitoring is to be \nlinked  to  decision  making  either  in  the  project  or  the  MGP steering committee or by line \ndepartments and LSGs. Relevant targets are needed for those at the frontline, and focus should \nbe on areas where performance is important and need improvement. For example, establishing \na  performance  system  for  primary  health  care  centers,  linked  to  the  service  delivery \nimprovement program, social audit, asset renewal, and the Right to Information Act could be \nuseful starting points, whereby the system starts with some basic indicators and progressively \nwidens in scope as the various policy measures and legislation are implemented.  \n \n ", "84  Appendix 11 \nRISK MITIGATION MEASURES \n \nA.
