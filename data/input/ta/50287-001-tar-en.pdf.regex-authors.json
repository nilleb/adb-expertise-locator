INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The regional capacity development technical assistance (TA)1 aims to support cities in \nCentral Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) program countries to strengthen their \ncapacity to plan and implement climate actions to further enhance sustainable, inclusive, and \nprosperous economic development. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The  pace  of  urbanization  is  increasing  in  many  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \ndeveloping member countries, including those involved in the CAREC program. If not properly \nmanaged, urbanization can increase pressure on energy and natural resources; increase pollution \nand production of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which contribute to climate destabilization; \nand threaten ecosystems. Cities within the CAREC region (\u201cCAREC cities\u201d) are home to much of \nthe region\u2019s population3 and have been the core drivers of national economic growth, but they \nhave also become major sources of GHG emissions and other air pollutants. Recognizing the \nneed to improve the urban environment, a number of city-level initiatives have emerged in the \nCAREC region that promote aspects of sustainable, low-carbon urbanization.4  Lessons from \nthese initiatives show that cities need better access to resources, support for local capacity \nenhancement, and more effective learning through cooperation among developing countries. In \nthe CAREC countries, the governance aspect of climate change work at the local level has often \nbeen unnoticed and underappreciated.  \n \n3.  Climate  change  impacts  are  becoming  increasingly  apparent,  and  led  to  a  historic \nagreement at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change, held in Paris in December 2015, to mobilize a greater commitment to climate \nactions. Countries, including those involved in the CAREC program,5 submitted their nationally \ndetermined contribution (NDC) targets to express their commitment. As the Paris agreement \ncame into force, to meet their NDC targets countries in the CAREC program will need additional \ncapacity building and technology transfer, as well as access to sufficient financial resources. \nAmong CAREC countries, Kazakhstan committed to reduce its 2030 GHG emissions by 25% \ncompared to 1990 levels, under the condition that international support for finance and technology \ntransfer is provided. Mongolia set a target to increase the share of renewable electricity capacity \nto 30% of the total electricity generation capacity and to reduce building heat loss by 40% by 2030 \ncompared to 2010 levels. The People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) set a target to have carbon \nemissions peak by 2030, and committed to best efforts to achieve earlier peaking. Support is \nurgently needed to assist CAREC countries in achieving these targets. \n \n4.  Cities  play  a  critical  role  in  the  CAREC  program.  A  focus  on  urban  low-carbon \ndevelopment and transformation is a logical, strategic way to help CAREC countries achieve their \nNDC targets. Empowering city governments will enable them to develop strategic plans and \nsuccessfully execute climate actions with effective sectoral and cross-sectoral measures to create \n                                                \n1  The TA is categorized as knowledge and support TA pursuant to the Staff Instruction on Business Processes for \nKnowledge and Support Technical Assistance issued on 13 March 2017. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 28 September 2016. \n3  More than 54% of the population in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) lived in urban areas in 2014; this is \nexpected to increase to 70% by 2030. In Mongolia, 60% of the total population resides in Ulaanbaatar, the capital \ncity. In Kazakhstan, about 57% of the total population lived in urban areas in 2015. \n4  Including the Livable Urban Areas Initiative in Georgia, the Low-Carbon Cities Initiatives, and Sponge Cities in the \nPRC. \n5  Uzbekistan is the only country in the CAREC program that did not submit a NDC; it is included in the TA, however. \n ", "2 \ngreater impacts and synergy. Supporting these cities to create a system that measures progress \ntowards stated goals is also essential. The TA is designed to support CAREC cities in this process. \n \n5.  The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, which highlights the importance of supporting \naction on climate change in ADB developing member countries,6 and with the Strategy 2020 \nmidterm review,7 which identified the need for an increased focus on the environment and climate \nchange, through support for (i) clean investments, (ii) sustainable transport, (iii) climate adaptation, \n(iv) integrated management of disaster and climate risks, (v) better natural resource management, \n(vi) policies and capacity strengthening, and (vii) access to global and regional funds. The TA is \nalso aligned with ADB\u2019s Priorities for Action on addressing climate change in Asia and the Pacific.8 \n \n6.  The TA is also aligned with the (i) country partnership strategy (CPS), 2016\u20132020 for the \nPRC,9 which sets out strategic priorities to place its economy on a more sustainable trajectory, \nwhile  addressing  complex  issues,  including  environmental  pollution  and  climate  action \nmanagement;  and  support  to  cities  for  their  integrated,  inclusive,  green,  and  competitive \ndevelopment; (ii) interim CPS for Mongolia, 2014\u20132016,10 and the draft CPS 2017-2020 which \nhighlight safeguarding the quality of life while promoting economic sustainability, climate change \nadaptation, adoption of renewable energy, and capacity development to drive change; and (iii) \nCPS for Kazakhstan, 2012\u20132016,11 which emphasizes accelerating economic diversification and \nstrengthening its competitive ability for sustainable and inclusive growth. In addition, it is aligned \nwith the CAREC 2016 Joint Ministerial Statement, which indicates a strong commitment to support \nclimate actions and the achievement of NDC targets; and ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Regional \nCooperation and Integration 2016\u20132020, which supports investing in regional public goods and \ncollective action. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The impact of the TA will be the achievement of the NDCs for Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and \nthe PRC. The outcome will be the mainstreaming of climate actions in city investment plans in \nKazakhstan, Mongolia, and the PRC. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  Output  1:  Sustainable  data  management  systems  for  greenhouse  gas  data \nassessed and enhanced at city level. To properly monitor a city\u2019s progress in reducing GHGs \nand enable comparison with the progress of other cities, it is important to have agreed-upon \naccounting and reporting standards. The TA will use the Global Protocol for Community-Scale \nGreenhouse Gas Emission Inventories (GPC).12 The establishment and management of an \naccurate GHG inventory requires a proper data management system, including (i) relevant legal \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2008.

To the extent possible, the \ndevelopment of the GHG inventory governance and management system will be integrated into \nthe existing public sector management structures of city governments and other stakeholders. \nThis will require a series of multistakeholder dialogues, consensus building, negotiations, and \nagreements. This project component will facilitate developing and sustaining data management \nsystems for GHG data, promoting multistakeholder engagement and activation. It also includes \ninformation technology and communication systems, and training in GPC and other relevant open \ndata methodologies and procedures.13 \n \n9.  Output 2: Recommended investment road maps for low-carbon economic growth \nat selected cities developed. This output will support selected pilot cities to build road maps for \nlow-carbon urban development including planning and investment prioritization. Activities include \nassessment  of  existing  development  strategies  and  plans,  development  of  low-carbon  city \nscenarios, and planning of short-, medium-, and long-term actions and relevant investment for \nlow-carbon  urban  development  and transformation. To  achieve  significant  carbon  emission \nreductions while boosting economic development, the project team will conduct sector-specific \nand system assessments and plan effective climate mitigation measures, which will enable the \ntransformation of clean and efficient energy and resource systems (in energy, transport, building, \nwaste, industry, agriculture, forestry, and land use sectors, if applicable) in selected cities, while \nsupporting wider deployment of key clean technologies.14 The output may also include measures \nto support the cities\u2019 climate resilience. \n \n10.  Under output 2, the air quality and health-related impacts of climate actions will be \nmeasured  and  assessed  for  at  least  one  pilot  city.  In  addition,  Output  2  will  explore  the \ndevelopment of carbon financing measures for at least one pilot city. The Cities Development \nInitiative for Asia fund will support the development of and due diligence for prioritized low-carbon \ncity investment plans for potential ADB loan financing.15 In this way road maps and investment \nplans will contribute to innovation, job creation, and long-term economic growth, with the potential \nto  develop  sustainable,  low-carbon,  and  livable  cities.  Multistakeholder  participation  will  be \nencouraged to a larger extent as possible. \n \n11.  Output 3: A source book on successful practices and measures driving low-carbon \neconomic development at city level developed and disseminated. Successful practices and \nmeasures implemented by CAREC cities have not been fully identified, recorded, or disseminated. \nUnder the PRC\u2019s low-carbon city initiative, many cities implemented effective GHG reduction \n                                                \n13 It was built upon the GHG inventory works under ADB. 2012.

Successful examples from cities in the \nPRC would be particularly relevant to other PRC cities, due to their similar social and technical \ncontext. In addition, successful low-carbon development practices and measures from other \nCAREC cities could be identified and recorded, along with any non-climate related benefits. \nDocumentation of these measures will enable other CAREC cities that face similar challenges to \nuse these as a reference in developing their own road maps for low-carbon urban development. \nThe source book will disseminate knowledge and lessons, including through global high-level \nevents, and further enhance developing country cooperation on climate change. \n \n12.  Output  4:  Capacity  for  low-carbon  city  development  among  CAREC  countries \nexpanded. This output will consist of a series of capacity building workshops, in which CAREC \ncities will be encouraged to commit to developing their own low-carbon city road maps by learning \nfrom  the  experiences  of  pilot  cities.  City  government  officials,  experts,  and  other  relevant \nstakeholders (including academia, think tanks, and relevant sector-specific organizations that \ncontribute to low-carbon city development) will learn how to enhance low-carbon development. \nAs a result of capacity building and networking activities among CAREC cities, a Low-Carbon City \nAlliance in CAREC will be established to enable CAREC cities to share experiences and lessons \non climate action. Close cooperation with the CAREC Institute is important to ensure ongoing \npromotion of the low-carbon city initiative.  \n \n13.  Considering the practicality of implementing the TA and the resources available, outputs \n1 and 2 will target pilot cities in Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and the PRC.16 These countries were \nselected as they are strongly committed to climate action. Selection criteria for pilot cities will be \nfurther developed during TA implementation prior to making the final selection of pilot cities. \nSelection criteria may include (i) a strong commitment to expedite low-carbon development and \nownership to develop a low-carbon road map, which will be critical for efficient TA implementation; \nand (ii) economic status, development patterns, and availability of natural resources, with a view \nto  ensuring  variation  among  pilot  cities.  City-level  steering  committees  which  include \nrepresentatives from city and central governments, and key stakeholders will be established to \nsupport smooth implementation of outputs 1 and 2 and evidence-based and inclusive decision \nmaking on low carbon development.17 Outputs 3 and 4 will cover cities in all countries under the \nCAREC  program,  which  show  strong  interest  to  participate  in  these  activities.  During  TA \nimplementation, successful climate actions and practices in both pilot cities and CAREC cities \ngenerally will be identified and compiled. Output 4 will target CAREC cities with a strong interest \nin enhancing their capacity for low-carbon city development, and will aim to create a Low-Carbon \nCity Alliance in CAREC to strengthen developing country cooperation. The CAREC Institute will \nbe actively engaged in order to support the implementation of outputs 3 and 4.  \n \n14.  ADB will regularly field review missions to review the performance of consultants, TA \nimplementation progress, and the completion of deliverables based on the design and monitoring \nframework as well as the agreed work plan for the consultants. ADB will review the deliverables \nsubmitted by the consultants. The performance of the TA, including its outputs and outcomes, will \nbe evaluated during the final review mission. \n   \n                                                \n16 The TA project is designed to accommodate other potential pilot cities in CAREC upon the availability of other trust \nfund sources. If additional cities express a commitment to and interest in participating in development of low-carbon \nroad maps during TA implementation, other trust funds may be approached to provide additional funding. \n17 The TA aims to contribute to SDG 16 throughout the activities under outputs 1 and 2. \n ", "5 \n \nC.
