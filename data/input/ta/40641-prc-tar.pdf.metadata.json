During the Country Program Midterm Review in April 2007, the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC) confirmed its request for assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to finance the \nproposed Small Cities and Towns Development Demonstration Sector Projects in Hebei, Liaoning, \nand Shanxi provinces. Financing will be under three sector loans, one for each province, but the \nimpacts  are  the  same:    improving  urban  environmental  conditions,  supporting  employment \ngeneration, and improving infrastructure facilities and municipal services in a range of small cities \nand towns. The resulting three projects are included in the 2009 lending program and a project \npreparatory technical assistance (TA) is scheduled for processing in 2007.1  ADB\u2019s Fact-Finding \nMission visited the three provinces in May\u2013June 2007. This report is based on the understanding \nreached with the Government regarding the impact and outcome, methodology and key activities, \ncost  estimates,  financing  plan,  and  implementation  arrangements  for  the  TA,  as  well  as  the \nMission\u2019s observations. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Urbanization continues to be a key thrust of the Government\u2019s development objectives \nunder the 11th Five-Year Program (2006\u20132010), with emphasis on balancing regional development \nbetween the coastal and inland provinces by coordinating the development of large, medium-sized, \nand small cities and statutory towns, and strengthening the development of urban settlements \naround metropolitan areas. This strategy of promoting growth with equity is in line with ADB\u2019s \nstrategic  priorities  in  the  PRC.  Both  the  11th  Five-Year  Program  and  ADB\u2019s  Town-Based \nUrbanization Strategy Study2 have stressed that the PRC should develop towns by facilitating the \ndevelopment of larger urban agglomerations. The national and provincial governments also need \nto focus their efforts on towns with high potential for employment generation and economic growth. \nThe Government aims to increase economic productivity and narrow the urban-rural income gap \nthrough the development of cities and towns. Cities are the main engines of economic growth in \nthe PRC today. In support of industrial production and administrative activity, the service sector in \ncities has expanded enormously in recent years, creating large numbers of jobs per unit of invest-\nment. At the same time, many towns located near metropolitan areas or along development \ncorridors play important roles as manufacturing centers, tourist destinations, and agroprocessing \nsites. Investment is justified as most urban infrastructure projects are considered public goods and \nare  expected  to  generate  positive  economic  externalities.  However,  municipal  and  town \ngovernments often lack financing and institutional capacity to prepare and implement large projects. \n \n3.  The proposed projects aim to help promote balanced and environmentally sustainable \nurbanization;  narrow  the  urban-rural  gap;  and  improve  production,  employment,  and  living \nconditions in small cities and towns in each of three project provinces (Hebei, Liaoning, and \nShanxi). The projects will support the development of selected small cities and towns in the three \nprovinces  that  will  have  a  demonstration  effect  for  other  small cities  and towns  in  the  three \nprovinces and elsewhere in the PRC. The projects will assist the provincial and local governments \nin developing an approach and criteria for selecting and prioritizing small cities and towns with \npotential for employment generation and economic growth, and those suffering from environmental \nblight, and will specifically seek to improve technical and financial sustainability within selected \nsectors. Institutional strengthening and operational know-how, supported by strength in financial \nmanagement with the introduction or strengthening of market-based mechanisms for public utilities \nand services, will form the cornerstone of the projects. Developing markets and creating jobs by \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 13 April 2007. \n2  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Town-Based Urbanization Strategy Study. \nManila. ", "2 \nsupporting urbanization and protecting the environment in small cities and towns are in line with \nADB's strategic objective of promoting growth with equity in the PRC. \n \n4.  The provinces of Hebei, Liaoning, and Shanxi are located in the north and northeast part of \nthe PRC. Their combined total population is 103.25 million, comprising mainly Han Chinese. The \npopulation living in urban areas represent about 40% of this total.3 Income levels in the three \nprovinces lag behind those of other areas of the PRC. In 2006 about 6%, 6.2%, and 8.8%, \nrespectively, of the total populations in Hebei, Liaoning, and Shanxi lived on incomes below the \nofficial poverty line, compared with the 4.95% national average poverty incidence.4 Hebei is the \ncenter  for  the  iron  and  steel  industry  which,  together  with  the  pharmaceutical  industry,  has \nproduced  heavy  pollution  in  the  province.  Liaoning  is  the  base  for  industrial  materials  and \nmachinery, while Shanxi produces about one third of the PRC\u2019s coal output and has significant \ncoal processing industries; all these activities compound environmental pollution.  \n \n5.  The race to industrialize has left much of the area with very significant pollution problems \nand correspondingly poor living conditions. Atmospheric, aquatic, and ground pollution blight the \nprovinces,  creating  a  poor  living  environment  and  a  serious  threat  to  human  health  and  life \nexpectancy. Living conditions for the populations of small cities and towns are made worse by \ncongestion and conflict between heavy industrial traffic and other road users, inadequate potable \nwater supplies, and lack of sewage collection and wastewater treatment. Centralized heating has \nlimited coverage and, elsewhere, heat is provided by a multiplicity of coal-burning stoves. Solid \nwaste management is often rudimentary with poor environmental protection. Increases in the urban \npopulation have outstripped the capacity to provide services, and poor asset maintenance has \ncompounded the problem. Public service providers are unable to manage sustainable operations, \nand restructuring is of paramount importance to ensure future viability and independence. There is \nalso  a  need  to  reduce  unemployment  by  realigning  skills  to  match  the  growing  demand  for \nworkforce in secondary industries.  \n \n6.  The proposed projects focus on supporting sustainable urban development and consist of a \nnumber of sector interventions primarily targeted to support industrial development, tourism, job \ncreation, and environmental protection. The main sectors are roads and associated services, \nrestoration of historical areas, water and wastewater, solid waste management, upgrading and \ngreening of rivers, district heating, and education.5 The subsectors involve (i) construction of new \nroads, focusing on town bypasses, upgrading the existing inadequate (unsurfaced) roads, and \nimproving traffic planning and management; (ii) repairs to and restoration of historic areas to \npromote tourism; (iii) increases in the capacity to supply  potable water and coverage of distribution \nnetworks, and provision of sewerage systems with associated wastewater treatment facilities; (iv) \nriver and lake improvement works to reduce the risk of seasonal flooding and increase the capacity \nto impound water for industrial, irrigation,  and other uses; (v) provision of modern solid waste \ncollection  equipment,  development  of  engineered  waste  disposal  sites,  and  strengthening  of \noperational management; (vi) provision of centralized heating plants and the associated heat \ndistribution networks; and (vii) support to educational establishments. All targeted small cities and \ntowns  have  approved  development  master  plans  and  programs  that  the  projects  will  directly \nsupport. A rapid environmental assessment has been carried out and a category A assessment is \nproposed to ensure that each project will minimize adverse environmental impacts on the affected \npeople and maximize environmental benefits to the subproject cities and towns and their residents. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  assessments  have  been  undertaken  for  a \n                                                 \n3  The urbanization rates in Hebei, Liaoning, and Shanxi were 38%, 58%, and 43% in 2006, respectively, and are \nexpected to rise to 47%, 63%, and 45% by 2010. \n4  The official low-income line in 2005 was CNY944 per capita per year, lower than the international standard of $1 per \ncapita per day. The 4.95% national poverty incidence equates to 64.32 million people. \n5  The sectors in which selected cities and towns have indicated a need for support are similar, and all TA reports will be \nshared by the three provinces. ", "3 \nselection of cities and towns across the three provinces and it is concluded that category A is \napplicable to resettlement and category C is applicable to indigenous peoples. \n \n7.  The proposed projects will be processed and implemented as three separate sector loans \nin support of the respective published and adopted provincial strategies for urban development. \nDetailed component proposals that fully support the planning strategy and sector goals  are being \ndeveloped for the first group of cities and towns in each province. The projects will seek to develop \napproaches and solutions to problems that can be replicated in urban centers throughout the three \nprovinces and may be used to demonstrate to other provinces across the PRC how to formulate \nplanning strategies and implement programs in support of structured development of small cities \nand towns. A participatory approach has been adapted under which the city and town stakeholders \nhave identified and prioritized the major problems in their urban area and highlighted necessary \nactions to address those problems. The subproject components, financed by ADB, will directly \nsupport  the  actions.  Numerous  internationally  supported  environmental  improvement  and \ninfrastructure  projects  are  under  construction  or  were  completed  recently  across  the  three \nprovinces,  and  the  necessary  implementation  capacity  exists  at  the  provincial  level  through \nexperienced  project  management  offices  (PMOs).6 Experience  under  those  projects  will  be \nreviewed to draw relevant lessons for the ensuing loans. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the TA is improved infrastructure, environmental protection, and employment \ngeneration in small cities and towns in Hebei, Liaoning, and Shanxi provinces. The TA will assist \nthe Government in preparing the Small Cities and Towns Development Demonstration Sector \nProjects,  which  will  be  processed  as  three  sector  loans  for  Hebei,  Liaoning,  and  Shanxi, \nrespectively;  and  in  developing  methodologies  that  are  appropriate  for  replication  across  the \nprovinces and elsewhere in the PRC.  \n \n9.  The outcome of the TA is project design and feasibility studies that are agreed on by the \nthree provincial governments and ADB. The TA will assist the respective provincial governments to \n(i) review and identify selection parameters for the priority listing of cities and towns to form the \nsubprojects; (ii) review and assess the scope of the most appropriate components to fulfill sector \nstrategy goals; (iii) prepare a feasibility study for the components of three core sample subproject \ncities/towns in each province; and (iv) prepare a sector-based small cities and towns development \nand  environmental  improvement  project,  including  environmental  impact  assessment, \nenvironmental management plan, social analysis, and resettlement plan in line with ADB policies \nand guidelines. The design and monitoring framework (DMF) is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will be implemented in three phases. Phase 1, lasting 1 month, will comprise \nstudies to (i) review and assess the current constraints to economic development and adverse \nenvironmental impacts due to lack of appropriate infrastructure in small cities and towns; (ii) review \nthe economic and environmental development strategies, priorities, and investment plans of Hebei \nprovincial  government  (HPG),  Liaoning  provincial  government  (LPG),  and  Shanxi  provincial \ngovernment (SPG), particularly with respect to development  of small cities and towns; (iii) identify \nthe problems and urgency of mitigating needs relating to urban infrastructure, services, and other \nissues in the subproject cities and towns; (iv) review the likely resettlement impact of the proposed \n                                                 \n6  Over the period 1997\u20132006, Hebei had signed project loans with ADB (2), World Bank (3), and bilateral agencies (11);  \nLiaoning had signed project loans with ADB (5) and World Bank (6); Shanxi had signed project loans with ADB (5) and \nWorld Bank (7). ", "4 \nprojects;  (v)  develop  a  project  DMF  taking  into  consideration  the  economic,  financial,  social, \nenvironmental impacts of the project; and (vi) prepare an inception report.  During phase 2, lasting \nfor 2.5 months, the TA will (i) assess the potential impacts of the components based on technical, \ninstitutional, environmental, social and ethnic, economic, financial, and other relevant factors; (ii) \nformulate balanced urban infrastructure development and pollution control strategies comprising \nstructural  and  nonstructural  measures;  (iii)  update  feasibility  studies  of  components  in  three \nsubproject cities/towns  in  each  province;  (iv)  assist  HPG,  LPG,  and  SPG  to  prepare  (and/or \nstrengthen  the  existing)  draft  environmental  impact  assessments,  resettlement  and  social \ndevelopment plans according to ADB\u2019s guidelines and policies, and conduct public consultation \nmeetings and disclosure of relevant information; (v) develop technical, thematic, and safeguards \nassessment guidelines for evaluating subprojects during project implementation; (vi) refine the \nDMF through a stakeholder workshop in each demonstration subproject city/town; and (vii) prepare \nan interim report. Phase 3, for 2.5 months, will assist HPG, LPG, and SPG to (i) formulate sector \ninvestment projects for each province for ADB funding; (ii) consolidate feasibility study reports \nprepared  in  phase  2;  (iii)  formulate  procurement  needs  and  corresponding  procurement \narrangements; (iv) justify their respective financial, economic, social, and environmental terms; and \n(v) prepare a draft final report. The initial poverty and social analysis for each province is in \nAppendix 2. \n \n11.  HPG,  LPG,  and  SPG  have  extensive  experience  with  internationally  funded  projects \nalthough  the  implementing  agencies  in  the  subproject  cities  have  no  experience  with  ADB \nprocedures. Therefore, the consultant will provide appropriate training continuously during project \npreparation and, specifically, in three 1-day workshops in each province covering (i) DMF and a \nproject performance monitoring system, (ii) environmental impact assessment and environmental \nmanagement planning, and (iii) resettlement plans and social development. The workshops will be \nheld after the inception reports have been finalized. \n \n12.  Major risks to the successful implementation of the TA include (i) inadequate counterpart \nsupport and performance, (ii) lack of adequate and timely provision of necessary data, (iii) delay in \nsubmitting  required  studies,  (iv)  delay  in  appointing  and  mobilizing  consultants  and  design \ninstitutes, and (v) inadequate performance by the consultants and design institutes. To mitigate the \nrisks, the recruitment and performance of the consultants and design institutes will be monitored \nclosely. The Government has agreed to provide adequate counterpart support and all necessary \ndata according to an agreed-upon timetable. Close coordination among the consultants, executing \nand implementing agencies, and ADB will further mitigate the risks. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $2,300,000 equivalent. It is proposed that \n$1,700,000 be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. HPG, LPG, and SPG will \nequally provide the balance of local costs, equivalent to $600,000, to cover in-kind counterpart \ncosts and services including counterpart staff, office space, furniture, administrative support and \ninterpretation services, logistics and local (city) transportation. The Government has been informed \nthat approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project or to extend any \nfurther TA with respect to the implementation of any recommendations of the TA. The detailed cost \nestimates are in Appendix 3.7 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  HPG, LPG, and SPG will be the executing agencies for the TA. Each has established a \nproject leading group to provide overall guidance and support to the proposed project. A PMO \n                                                 \n7  The budget for equipment, workshops, and survey will be equally shared by the three provinces and will be \nadministered by the TA consultant in consultation with the three executing agencies. ", "5 \ncomprising representatives from the Finance Bureau, Development and Reform Commission, and \nConstruction Bureau, among others, has been established in each province and reports to its \nrespective project leading group. The PMOs will maintain interdepartmental coordination, ensure \nthe study team\u2019s access to relevant information and data, liaise with ADB on matters relating to TA \nimplementation, and facilitate socioeconomic, poverty, and other surveys required. Each PMO is \nled  by  a  director  and  has  a  minimum  of  three  experienced  professional  staff,  including  an \ninterpreter/translator, who will work with the consultants on a full-time basis. \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over a 6-month period and is expected to start in January 2008 \nand be completed by July 2008.  The TA will be conducted by a separate team for each province, \nreporting to a coordinating team leader located centrally in Hebei. The national consultant teams \nwill work discretely within the respective provinces. A total of 137 person-months of consulting \nservices  (52  international  and  85  national) will  be  required.  The  international  consultants  will \nprovide  expertise  in  urban  development,  transport  planning  and  management,  water  and \nwastewater engineering, solid waste management, district heating, river and lake hydrology and \nflood control, historic building works, financial and economic analyses, resettlement planning and \nsocial impact analysis (poverty and gender), institutional capacity development, and environmental \nimpact assessment. The national consultants will have expertise in road and transport engineering, \ncivil  and  geotechnical  engineering,  solid  waste  management,  project  economic  and  financial \nanalyses, environmental protection, socioeconomic analysis and resettlement, technical education \nand vocational training, and institutional and legal aspects of urban development. The terms of \nreference for the consultants are in Appendix 4. \n \n16.  An international consulting firm in association with national consultants will be engaged in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). ADB will select and engage consultants on the basis of the quality of the proposal (90%) and \nthe cost (10%) of the services to be provided (the quality- and cost-based selection method) using \nthe full technical proposal procedures. The 90/10 weighting is considered appropriate because the \nTA is a complex multidisciplinary assignment that requires innovation and creativity and the quality \nof the consulting services will have a high impact on the ensuing sector loans, which are expected \nto be demonstrable for replication. One set of inception, interim, draft final, and final reports will be \nproduced for each of the three provinces. All reports by the consultants will be prepared in English \nand translated into Chinese. The consultants will maintain close working relations with ADB and \nwith HPG, LPG, and SPG, and will regularly discuss progress and findings. Tripartite meetings \ninvolving ADB staff, the consultants, and HPG, LPG, SPG will be held in Shijiazhuang, Shenyang, \nand Taiyuan cities, respectively, to provide guidance to the consultants and to review their reports. \n \n17.  Each  PMO  will  provide  a  suitably  furnished  office  with  utilities  and  telecommunication \naccess,  city-level  transport  (excluding  transport  between  subproject locations)  for  consultants, \nmaterials, maps, data and documents required by the TA; and will cover the cost of utilities for the \nuse of the consultants, counterpart professional staff, and support staff. The TA equipment will be \nprocured by the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time) and transferred to HPG, LPG, and SPG upon completion of the TA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n18.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $1,700,000 on a grant basis to the Government of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China for Preparing the Small Cities and Towns Development Demonstration Sector \nProjects.

Objectives \n1.  The objectives of the technical assistance (TA) are to (i) identify the most appropriate \nmunicipal infrastructure, public services, and urban upgrading programs to facilitate economic \ndevelopment, expand urban utility services, enhance environmental protection and management, \nsupport employment generation, and reduce the existing low income levels in the secondary small \ncities and towns of the provinces of Hebei, Liaoning, and Shanxi; (ii) prepare feasibility studies for \na sector-based investment project in each province based on detailed assessment of three core \nsubprojects for each province; (iii) establish criteria for selection and prioritization of subproject \ncities and towns; and (iv) formulate the project using as reference the demonstration subprojects in \neach province, for possible funding by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).  \n \nB.  Policy Dialogue-Related Activities  \n2.  Policy dialogue is ongoing between ADB and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in \nconnection with ADB\u2019s urban lending program in the PRC. To strengthen the dialogue in relation to \nthe projects, the consultants will prepare notes for policy dialogue\u2015based on discussions with the \nthree  provincial  governments\u2015on  (i)  strategies  and  enabling  legislation  required  to  facilitate \ndevelopment of subregions, cities, and towns and including the sectors covered under the projects; \n(ii) activities and interventions needed to strengthen the ability of city and town local governments \nto guide their own development; (iii) targeting provincial resources for efficiency and equity; (iv) \ncapacity  building  and  the  upgrading  of  necessary  skills  to  ensure  managerial,  technical,  and \nfinancial independence of utility/urban service operation; (v) cost recovery and tariff reform for \nrevenue-generating  sector  operations;  (vi)  urban  poverty  reduction,  social  protection,  and \nresettlement  policies;  (vii)  participatory  approach  to  project  design;  and  (viii)  regulatory \nenforcement and monitoring. \n \nC.  Design and Monitoring Framework \n3.  In  consultation  with  government  agencies,  the  public,  and  project  stakeholders,  the \nconsultants will develop, through stakeholder workshops and meetings, a design and monitoring \nframework for each subproject that outlines the impact, outcomes, outputs, and inputs or activities. \nThe consultants will develop baseline urban infrastructure and services provision, environmental \nand social indicators (including health and other relevant data) necessary to effectively monitor \nproject performance, and will collect baseline indicators as appropriate. Each project framework will \nbe developed using problem-tree analysis and will be based on a participatory approach1 involving \nbeneficiaries and stakeholders in project development, which will form the basis for the project \nperformance management systems (PPMS) and risk and sensitivity analysis.  \n \nD.  Training \n4.  The  executing  agencies  (EAs)  have  had  good  experience  with  internationally  funded \nprojects, but the implementing agencies (IAs) in the cities and towns have no such experience. The \nconsultants will therefore provide appropriate training to both as a continuous exercise during \nproject preparation for demonstration towns, specifically, in three workshops per province, which \nwill cover the following subjects: (i) design and monitoring framework/PPMS; (ii) environmental \nimpact assessment (EIA) and environmental management plan (EMP); and (iii) resettlement plans \n(RPs) and social development initiatives. The workshops will be held shortly after the issuance of \ninception reports. \n                                                 \n1  Initiated by city and town workshops during the initial TA Fact-Finding Mission in May 2007. ", "    Appendix 4          17 \nE.  Overall Scope of Work2 \n5.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 6 months by three teams, one per province, \nreporting to a coordinating team leader.3 The national consultant teams will work discretely within \nthe respective provinces. The consultants will work in close association with the EAs and will \naccomplish the following activities for three demonstration small cities or towns in each province: (i) \nreview and assess the development master plan, sector plans, investment plans, and institutional \ncapacity of the executing agencies to ensure the project will meet the criteria for sector lending; (ii) \nestablish criteria for subproject selection in each province; (iii) prepare a feasibility study report for \neach core subproject, including an assessment of the technical, financial, economic, social, and \nenvironmental impacts of the subproject and its components in accordance with ADB\u2019s policies and \nguidelines; (iv) formulate the subprojects to improve urban infrastructure, public services, and other \ninterventions to facilitate the development of secondary industries, employment generation, and \nenvironmental protection in accordance with sector development strategies for cities and towns; \nand (v) provide training and capacity building in the IAs of demonstration subprojects. The scope of \nthe consultants\u2019 work is given in the following paras. \n \n1.  Technical Aspects (international consultants, total 25.5 person-months; and 11 \nnational consultants, total 35.5 person-months) \n6.
