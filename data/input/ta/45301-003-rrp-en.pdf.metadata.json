THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the additional financing of the Water \nSupply and Sanitation Sector Project. \n \n2.  Recognizing the importance of provincial water utilities, or provincial nam papas (PNPs), \nin providing sustainable water supply and sanitation (WSS) services, the Asian Development \nBank (ADB), on 9 October 2013, approved a loan amounting to $35 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFund and a grant totaling $6 million from Phu Bia Mining Limited, to be administered by ADB, for \nthe Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project (current project) to the Lao PDR.1  \n \n3.  Since its approval in 2013, the current project has helped improve the performance of PNPs \nand expand access to better WSS services for urban residents in select small towns of the Lao \nPDR. Given the current project\u2019s good performance and achievements, the additional financing \nwill continue to strengthen PNPs and expand access to more efficient, and climate- and disaster-\nresilient WSS services for urban residents in small towns. It will support the implementation of \nsubprojects in six new towns, in addition to those ongoing in nine towns.  \n \n4.  With the additional financing, the overall project will (i) expand access to high-quality and \nreliable piped water supply services for the urban population, (ii) strengthen the PNPs\u2019 capacity to \nmanage water supply systems in a resilient manner, and (iii) support government and community \nefforts to deliver urban WSS. The inclusion of women and poor people will remain a priority. The \ncurrent project\u2019s approach and structure will apply under the additional financing. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n5.  Sector constraints and opportunities. The population of the Lao PDR in 2017 is \nestimated at 6.69 million, of whom a third reside in five large urban centers and 150 small towns \nin 144 districts. The gross domestic product was estimated at $2,408 per capita in 2016 and \n$2,550 in 2017.2 The poverty rate declined to 23.2% in 2013 and is projected to fall by 1 \npercentage point per annum.  \n \n6.  WSS is a basic urban service which contributes to the economic growth of towns. Access \nto piped water supply is still low in the Lao PDR\u2014only 64% of urban residents had it in 2015. \nHowever,  access to  improved  sanitation  is  high,  covering  94%  of the  population  in  2015. \nIncreasing water supply coverage and quantity, improving its quality, and ensuring service \ncontinuity will help improve urban residents\u2019 health condition and accelerate poverty reduction.  \nFurther, the urban WSS systems in the Lao PDR are exposed to disaster and climate change \nrisks that may impact water reservoirs, treatment plant structures, and distribution networks. The \nurban WSS systems in the Lao PDR require careful designing to incorporate resilient features \nbased on the principles of water safety planning.3 \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2013.

The  current  project  supports  the  government\u2019s  urban  sector \ntargets\u201490% coverage for piped water supply and 100% coverage for sanitation by 2030\u2014and its \nexpected outcome is stronger performance of participating PNPs in delivering sustainable water \nsupply to 155,500 urban residents and sanitation services to 163,000 urban residents in 11 towns \nin six provinces. The project is being executed by the Department of Water Supply (DWS), which \nwas established in 2015 in the Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT). \n \n8.  Implementation progress. The current project started slowly due to the implementation \nassistance  consultant  late  recruitment  and  subsequent  delays  in  subprojects\u2019  design  and \nprocurement. It also suffered from grant funds loss as Phu Bia Mining Limited withdrew in \nDecember 2016; it did so primarily because of the project\u2019s slow start and because its ownership \nchanged and its priorities shifted to dealing with the mining global decline and price erosion.  \n \n9.  Achievements to date. After the change in financing plan and project scope, the current \nproject\u2019s implementation significantly accelerated. It is rated on track, with cumulative contract \nawards of $22.29 million equivalent (69% of the loan amount) and cumulative disbursement of \n$7.06 million equivalent (21% of the loan amount). To date, the following results have been \nachieved: \n(i)  Institutional reform successfully yielded a new and dedicated DWS (also covering \nsanitation), reflecting the growing importance of the sector within the MPWT.4 In \naddition, corporate plans were developed for six subprojects by four PNPs, two of \nwhich have secured approval.  \n(ii)  The project (categorized as effective gender mainstreaming) greatly contributed to \nstrengthening women\u2019s roles by achieving the targets for the number of female \nstaff in local government and project-related committees.  \n(iii)  Community consultation meetings and workshops were delivered to 7,390 persons, \nof which 45% are women.  \n(iv)  Having a dedicated DWS also allowed the staff to focus on project administration \nand improve project performance.5 \n \n10.  Rationale for additional financing. Phu Bia Mining Limited\u2019s withdrawal resulted in a $6 \nmillion funding shortfall and reduced project benefits, accordingly. Having overcome the slow start \nand having strengthened the sector\u2019s oversight through the DWS, the government was keen to \nramp up its efforts and therefore requested additional financing of $30.50 million to expand WSS \ncoverage and improve PNPs\u2019 performance. Helped by an experienced DWS, project management \nstaff, and consultants, the government is fitted to using funds successfully to achieve its 2030 \nWSS targets. With the additional financing, the current project will be almost doubled. Based on \nthe DWS performance for the last six months,6 the government is confident of implementing the \noverall project successfully.  \n \n11.  Strategic alignment. The current project is on track, maintaining both a satisfactory \nimplementation pace and compliance with ADB policies. It has shown compliance with its loan \ncovenants,  particularly  on  project  implementation,  contract  awards,  safeguards  reporting \nrequirements, updated WSS sector policies, and grievance redress mechanism, and has partially \n                                                \n4  Water supply and sanitation were previously the responsibility of the Department of Housing and Urban Planning. \n5  Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6  The EA\u2019s performance has significantly improved in terms of overseeing design and procurement. The average \nnumber of days from advertisement to final bid evaluation report was 102 days for the bids invited in July\u2013November \n2016 while it was 64 days for the bids invited in October\u2013November 2017.  \n \n \n ", "    3 \ncomplied covenants on tariff increases and gender. It has, however, not complied with its \ncovenant on outstanding water bills because the actual institutional setup in the Lao PDR is more \ncomplicated than it was considered during project conceptualization and further work is required \non supporting the reform process. The project meets the eligibility criteria for additional financing, \nsuch as overall development objectives, being consistent and being strategically aligned with \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Lao PDR, 2017\u20132020, and is included in ADB\u2019s country \noperations  business  plan  for  Lao  PDR,  2018\u20132020.7 The  additional  financing  modality  is \nappropriate because the current project is performing well and exhibits a high degree of project \nreadiness in design, implementation capacity, and safeguards. It will continue to contribute to the \ngovernment\u2019s efforts to achieve its urban sector targets by 2030.   \n \n12.  Development coordination. Development coordination supports capacity development to \nachieve policy reforms. The Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation supported corporate \nplans for those PNPs included in the Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project. It \nsupported 5 years of capacity development technical assistance to improve PNPs management \ncapabilities, on which the additional financing will build to deliver a comprehensive corporate plan. \n \n13.  Lessons learned. Lessons learned from the implementation of the current project include \nPNP\u2019s poor capacity on operation and maintenance (O&M) and budget management, poor water \nconservation practices, and lack of disaster risk awareness. To address these issues, the additional \nfinancing  will  (i)  provide  training  for  PNP  staff  on  O&M,  budget  preparation  and  execution, \naccounting, cash planning, and performance measurement; (ii) conduct awareness programs for \nvillage communities on water conservation to cope with urbanization and reduced dry season river \nflows caused by deforestation; (iii) use robust equipment to reduce O&M; and (iv) provide easy \naccess to units within facilities for easy O&M. \n \n14.  ADB\u2019s value addition. ADB\u2019s value addition lies in supporting the government through a \nsector reform process by providing both lending and non-lending support and helping improve the \nPNPs\u2019 performance in the delivery of urban WSS services. Through the overall project and \nongoing activities under the Greater Mekong Subregion Corridor Towns Development projects, \nADB\u2019s support will allow the government to expand its sanitation mandate and help achieve its \n2030 WSS targets, and address improved health and hygiene conditions in urban areas. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n15.  The impact of the overall project remains unchanged: urban access to quality and reliable \npiped water supply and sanitation services in the Lao PDR improved. The outcome of the overall \nproject also remains unchanged: performance of the participating PNPs in delivering sustainable \nWSS improved. In terms of beneficiaries, the number of urban residents with access to safe piped \nwater supply will increase from 100,000 to 200,000 while the number of urban residents with \naccess to improved sanitation facilities will increase from 170,000 to 210,000. The overall project \nis expected to cover eight PNPs and improve WSS in 15 towns. \n \nC.  Outputs \n16.  Output 1: Sector coordination and policy implementation improved.

These activities entail (i) service agreements between PNPs and provincial governments; \nPNPs training on corporate planning and financial management, tariff adjustments, issuance of \ndistrict  sanitation  regulations,  use  of  simplified  corporate  plans,  and  integration  of  disaster \npreparedness measures in the corporate planning process; (ii) expanded policy implementation, \nincluding  nationalizing  a  policy  for  sanitation  regulations  and  inclusive  connection  fees,  wider \ncoordination of nonrevenue water (NRW) management, asset management, and water safety plans; \nand (iii) capacity development, including safeguards training and the introduction of O&M service \ncontracts for participating PNPs (e.g., administration support, PNP leak-detection equipment) for \ntwo additional PNPs under the additional financing. \n \n17.  Output 2: NRW management and water supply development improved. Output 2 will \nintegrate a comprehensive program to reduce NRW in the existing system and expand water supply \nto areas not yet covered, lowering average NRW levels to 20%. The current project covers three \ntowns, and the additional financing will cover three towns thereby covering six towns in total. The \noverall project will expand water supply distribution pipelines to 250 kilometers (km): 150 km \nunder the current project and 100 km under the additional financing. \n \n18.  Output 3: New water supply systems in small towns developed. PNPs participating in \noutputs 1 and 2 will be eligible for financing to build a new water system in a small district town in the \nsame province, acquire related O&M equipment, and offer free metered connections to households \n(HHs), provided they have sanitation facilities installed. Special attention will be paid to ensure that \nthe infrastructure is in the least-risk area and the proposed structures are built to withstand floods \nand geophysical hazards. The current project covers six towns, and the additional financing will \nadd three towns. The overall project will construct 150 km of new water distribution systems: 100 \nkm under the current project and 50 km under the additional financing. \n \n19.  Output 4: Community action in water supply and sanitation enhanced. It will widen the \nbenefits from investing in water supply systems to 15 small towns (nine towns under the current \nproject and six under the additional financing) through sanitation and awareness activities. These \ninvolve (i) VEI grants8, such as drainage improvements and village access roads for core villages \naccording to agreed eligibility criteria; (ii) HH sanitation grants for the poor9 without a sanitary \nprivate latrine (construct a new or upgrade existing) to improve HH sanitation; (iii) new or \nrehabilitated public sanitation facilities, for which O&M can be contracted to a business or social \nentity, and septage disposal facilities where they are unavailable in the subproject area; and (iv) \nincreased project and hygiene awareness through stakeholder consultations and community \nparticipation aiming at improved sanitation and hygiene behavior change. Access to sanitation \nwill be expanded in participating towns, whereby beneficiaries finance their own units to become \neligible for water supply connections. Output 4 will also strengthen communities capacity to \nunderstand the factors contributing to  disaster and climate risks through improvements on \ncommunity-level infrastructure.10 The community engagement process will allow identifying and \n                                                \n8  The project will contribute up to 80% of the cost of improvements ($10\u2013$25 per capita), local governments at least 10%, \nand the village at least 10% in cash. Percentages exclude taxes and duties, which the government will finance. \n9  The poor households will be identified in accordance with the criteria set forth in the Prime Minister\u2019s Decree No. \n285, dated October 2009, or otherwise agreed to in advance with ADB. Each eligible will receive materials for the \nconstruction of durable water seal pit latrine amounting to $140. Construction materials will be procured through \nshopping and handed to the poor.   \n10  The project will contribute up to 80% of the cost of improvement (from $10 per capita to $25 per capita), local \ngovernment at least 10%, and the village at least 10% in cash.

Project readiness. Recruitment of a new project implementation assistance consultant is \nnot required; a contract variation will be prepared to extend the contract of the current consultant. \nAs for the six towns under the additional financing, feasibility studies are available for four of them \nand DEDs for two. It is expected that contracts amounting to 50% of the additional financing \namount will be awarded by end Q1 2019. The market assessment of construction contractors \nindicates availability of a small pool of firms eligible to undertake WSS works. Consequently, bid \nevaluations will carefully consider bidders\u2019 personnel and financial capacity to undertake more \nworks of similar nature and size before awarding contracts.  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n25.  Location and design features of water treatment plant facilities will factor in disaster and \nclimate risk considerations and, where relevant to the lifespan of the infrastructure, future changes \nin the frequency and/or intensity of extreme events as well as long-term changes in average \ndisaster, climate, and geophysical risks. These designs have proven to be robust, durable, \ntechnically viable, and disaster risk measures were well received by the PNPs. Subproject \nselection will be based on criteria such as population density, poverty incidence, and existing \nWSS coverage. Feasibility studies and DEDs for the sample subprojects in Sopbao and Xam-\nNua towns, which are representative of subprojects under the additional financing, have all \nfactored in lessons from the current project. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n26.  Economic analysis. It was conducted for two water-supply sample subprojects, Sopbao \nand Xam-Nua, following ADB guidelines. Benefits considered are (i) resource cost savings \nassociated with the replacement of non-incremental water consumed and previously obtained \nfrom alternative sources; and (ii) consumer surplus, reflected in the incremental water consumed. \nThe estimated economic internal rates of return are 16.03% for Sopbao and 18.63% for Xam-\nNua, higher than the economic opportunity cost of capital assumed at 9.00%, indicating significant \neconomic  returns.  Sensitivity  analysis  for  various  scenarios  revealed  that  the  proposed \ncomponents are most sensitive to a project delay and a decrease in subproject benefits but remain \nabove the economic opportunity cost of capital.12 \n \n27.  Financial analysis. It was assumed that the government would extend subloans to the \nHouaphan PNP for implementing the Sopbao and Xam-Nua subprojects (and all those considered \nfor additional financing) on the same terms as for the subprojects under the current project (i.e., \nof the total subproject cost, 70% will be granted and 30% will be on-lent at 6.40% per annum with \na 6-year grace period). The financial internal rate of return is 12.43% for Xam-Nua and 8.63% for \nSopbao, exceeding the weighted average cost of capital of 7.18%. The sensitivity analysis \nindicates that the subprojects are most sensitive to a project delay and a decrease in revenues \nbut remain well above the weighted average cost of capital. The PNPs\u2019 sustainability depends \nheavily on the implementation of tariff revisions, and participating PNPs will conduct a tariff review \nevery  3  years  and  adjust  levels  to  meet  the  government\u2019s  cost-recovery  objectives  on \nsustainability as well as ADB\u2019s loan and grant covenants. \n \n                                                \n12 Economic Analysis (available from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nC.  Governance \n28.  The pre-mitigation financial management risk is moderate. Project fund utilization is in \naccordance with the original expenditure category, but funds needed to be reallocated to align \nthe financing plan with actual conditions. Procurement oversight by the government has improved \nsince the establishment of the DWS under the MPWT in 2015. To ensure good governance, \nconditions  precedent for  contract  award  include  (i)  submission  of  corporate  plans,  and  (ii) \nsubsidiary loan agreements executed. The institutional capacity of the State Audit Office has \nimproved  with  support  from  ADB  and  other  development  partners.  Financial  management \nsolutions such as building the accounting capacity of PNP staff are being considered, and an \nindependent auditing company, complying with international standards, is also being recruited. \nAdditional measures will be taken to enhance financial management, such as (i) updating the \nPNPs financial reporting systems to comply with international accounting standards, and (ii) PNPs \ncapacity building. No complaints were recorded, nor any incidence of corruption; and compliance \nwith ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy has been satisfactory. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual.13 \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n29.  Poverty reduction and social impacts. The additional financing will directly benefit about \n19,760 HHs in the six towns with access to reliable piped water supply, and 491 of them with \naccess to improved sanitation facilities. It eliminates barriers to access for the urban poor and \nprioritizes poor districts. Health benefits will be derived through access to improved drinking water; \ngreater water availability for sanitation and personal hygiene; and better access to improved \nsanitation. The additional financing will provide VEI grants to enhance community involvement in \nsanitation and environmental improvements, targeted latrine subsidies for poor HHs, and free \nwater connections for poor HHs. \n \n30.  Gender. The current project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming, and the \nadditional  financing  will  align  with  this.  The  gender  action  plan  builds  on  current  project \nimplementation experiences. Gender benefits for women will result from greater convenience, \nless physical strain, and time savings in water collection; stronger family health; more privacy and \ndignity when tending to sanitation needs; and improved facilities specific to women\u2019s health and \nmenstrual hygiene. It supports gender equity in decision-making on, and water and sanitation \nissues  management.  Strategic  measures  include  (i)  gender-sensitive  targets  in  the  PNPs\u2019 \ncorporate action plans, (ii) targets for female PNP staff members in the asset management task \nforces, (ii) a target of 20%\u201330% of village development committee subcommittee members \n(depending upon VEI size) responsible for planning and managing VEIs being women; and (iii) a \nminimum of 30% women staff in the project coordination unit and project implementation units. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n31.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are detailed below.14 Any subprojects classified as category A will be excluded from \nthe overall project. Public consultations were carried out to inform stakeholders and affected \npersons about the overall project design and will continue during implementation. A project \nsafeguard grievance redress mechanism will facilitate the resolution of complaints. \n                                                \n13 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14  ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n ", "    9 \n \n32.  Environment (category B). Two initial environmental examination (IEE) reports and \nenvironmental management plans were prepared for representative subprojects, Sopbao and \nXam-Nua, in Houaphan province. Environmental management plans include identified impacts \nmitigation and monitoring measures, enforced by grant covenants, with adequate implementation \nbudget. The updated environmental assessment and review framework provides subprojects \nguidance on the selection, screening, assessment, and implementation that will be prepared after \ngrant approval. Draft IEEs, environmental assessment and review framework were disclosed on \nADB website on 13 April 2018.15 Final IEEs will be updated once DEDs are completed.  \n \n33.  The subprojects in Sopbao and Xam-Nua will provide safer, cleaner, and more reliable \nwater supply to beneficiaries in 17 villages within the two towns. Identified subprojects will have \nlocalized, short-term impacts during construction. Further studies are proposed during DED \npreparation in respect of raw water quality and downstream fish conservation zones. Construction \nand operational environmental impacts can be prevented or minimized to an acceptable level \nthrough  effective  implementation  of  mitigation  and  monitoring  measures  specified  in  the \nenvironmental management plans. The proposed capacity building for O&M will include raw water \nquality monitoring, treatment process, management and risks associated with sludge disposal. \n \n34.  Resettlement (category B). Due diligence conducted on four subprojects implemented \nunder the current project indicates that impacts during construction are temporary in nature. \nSafeguard monitoring reports were submitted regularly and disclosed on the ADB website. It also \nconfirms that HHs were compensated as prescribed in the land acquisition and compensation \nplan of each subproject and that no voluntary donation mechanisms were utilized to acquire land. \nOverall, the additional financing will adhere to methods used for the current project, but the land \nacquisition and compensation framework was revised and updated to remove voluntary donation \nmechanisms in relation to the water supply component of the project. \n \n35.  The two sample subprojects in Sopbao and Xam-Nua will not severely affect any individual \nor have significant impacts. No land acquisition is required in Sopbao, and only 284 square meters \nof land will be acquired from two HHs in Xam-Nua, but the impacts are not significant in nature, \nrepresenting only 2.94% and 1% of these households\u2019 total land holdings. Temporary or minor \nimpacts on driveways, fences, and walls, with no loss of income, shall occur; the contractor will \nrestore these to pre-project conditions. A loss of fruit-bearing trees will also occur, but the loss of \nincome\u2014at an average of 2% of HH income\u2014is not significant in nature. Households shall be \ncompensated for their losses at replacement cost. Initial screening was undertaken for four other \nsubprojects already identified but indicated neither land acquisition nor resettlement needs. To \nmitigate and manage any impacts, two land acquisition and compensation plans were developed \nin line with the updated land acquisition and compensation framework and disclosed on the ADB \nwebsite on 26 April 2018.16 The final plans will be updated and disclosed in English and Lao once \nDEDs are completed. No physical or economic displacement will occur until full replacement cost \ncompensation and assistance in accordance with the plans has been paid. \n \n36.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The additional financing is category C for indigenous \npeoples. The poverty and social assessment confirmed that the project will not affect ethnic \ngroups\u2019 traditional sociocultural or belief practices, customary livelihoods, or ancestral domains. \n \n                                                \n15 IEE, Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (available from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 Land Acquisition and Compensation Plan, and Land Acquisition and Compensation Framework (available from the \nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n37.  The overall risk assessment is low, and the integrated benefits and impacts are expected \nto outweigh the costs.
