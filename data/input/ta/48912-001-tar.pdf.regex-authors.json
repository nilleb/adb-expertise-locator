INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Strengthening  the  financial  sector  by  helping  to  develop  financial  institutions, \ninfrastructure, and products and services is a key component of Strategy 2020.1 Through such \ninitiatives,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  can  support  inclusive  economic  growth, \nstimulated by private sector investment, which can be a key contributing factor in reducing \npoverty. Technical assistance (TA) is an important value addition that ADB can provide to \nleverage  its  nonsovereign  funding,  and  is  a  development  tool  that  is  used  frequently  and \nsuccessfully by bilateral and multilateral development banks in combination with private sector \nlending.2 For the financial sector, for instance, TA can be used to help financial institutions \ndevelop or test new products that they would normally not undertake, which can widen access \nto finance for underserved customer segments. TA can also be used to encourage financial \ninstitutions to improve corporate governance or anti-money laundering (AML) standards beyond \nlocal requirements. \n \n2.  As part of ADB\u2019s efforts to strengthen the financial sector and enhance its development \nimpact in its developing member countries (DMCs),  ADB has approved three regional capacity \ndevelopment TA projects for private sector financial institutions. The first project was completed \nin 2011 and the second project will be completed at the end of 2014. The third TA targets \ntransition countries in Central Asia and Mongolia.3 These TA projects have been used along \nwith ADB funding or guarantees to private sector financial institutions to enhance capacity \ndevelopment  for  (i)  corporate  governance  and  internal  controls;  (ii)  financing  strategies, \nincluding new product development; (iii) AML, antiterrorism, and anticorruption efforts; (iv) risk \nmanagement;  and  (v)  environmental  and  social  safeguards.  Based  upon  the  successful \nutilization of the previous TA projects as well as the continued need for financial sector capacity \ndevelopment, the proposed TA for SEAP will continue to support financial sector development in \nthese DMCs and enhance ADB\u2019s development impact. The design and monitoring framework is \nin Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  A  strong  financial  sector  is  necessary  to  facilitate  economic  growth  and  financial \ninclusion,  which  underpins  poverty  reduction. 4  Financial  sector  development  is  varied \nthroughout ADB\u2019s DMCs in SEAP, and access to finance remains a major obstacle to private \nsector development and poverty alleviation. Domestic credit provided by the banking sector as a \npercentage of gross domestic product (GDP) has remained low in SEAP countries, indicating \nshallow financial intermediation. As of the end of 2013, domestic credit to the private sector as a \npercentage of GDP was 45.3% in Cambodia, 37.9% in Indonesia, 35.8% in the Philippines,  \n68.1% in Vanuatu, and 77.9% in Fiji. This percentage was higher in neighboring countries such \nas Malaysia (124.3%) and Thailand (154.4%).5 In many SEAP countries, banking sector assets \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014.

Washington, DC. \n ", "2   \n \n \nhave grown more slowly than GDP.6 Moreover, access to credit for small and medium-sized \nenterprises  (SMEs)  and  other  nontraditional  sector  borrowers  are  low  versus  larger,  more \nestablished borrowers.7 SME loans make up just 25% of total bank lending across Asia and the \nPacific due to perceived risks associated with SMEs, projects\u2019 bankability, and the lack of \nappropriate risk-based measures in place.8 The nonbanking sector in the SEAP region also \nremains undeveloped, with an average ratio of financial sector assets to GDP of 3%.9 This lack \nof development is exemplified by the fact that emerging Asian economies pay 3.0% of GDP to \ninsurance premiums, while advanced Asian economies pay 11.8%.10  \n \n4.  Access to finance is constrained due to a variety of reasons, including bank lending \nbiases that favor upper-income borrowers, undiversified and short-term product offerings, and \nheavy data and large collateral requirements. Part of the solution to creating stronger and more \ndiversified financial sectors in ADB\u2019s DMCs is knowledge transfer and capacity building within \nbanks to help them develop more innovative strategies and products tailored to a broader \nspectrum  of  borrowers,  including  SMEs.  In  addition,  corporate  governance,  AML,  and \nanticorruption efforts need to be strengthened in many financial institutions throughout the \nSEAP region. Related party transactions, for instance, are prevalent in Asia and need to be \ncarefully monitored.11 Risk management practices are still below international standards, and \nwith the move to Basel III and as financial systems in SEAP become larger, more complex, and \nmore interconnected, many banks will need capacity development to ensure that adequate risk \nmanagement systems are in place. Good environmental and social management systems and \npolicies are also needed, and their introduction will typically require external expertise. \n \n5.  The following observations reflect SEAP country issues: \n(i)  Cambodia. The country has made progress in developing its financial sector \nsince 2004. It has passed laws to support a market-driven system, strengthened \nkey financial institutions, and emphasized the importance of supporting financial \ninclusion for the rural poor. However, financial infrastructure is still basic and \nassets are concentrated in a few large banks.12 Capacity development is needed \nto help reduce the skills gap and human capital deficits in the sector. Also, the \nnonbanking sector needs support with respect to the introduction of new products \nsuch as pension, leasing, and insurance. \n(ii)  Viet Nam. The country has expanded its financial sector significantly since 1991 \nwhen the country had just 10 banks. In 2013, domestic credit provided by the \nprivate sector amounted to 96.8% of GDP (footnote 4). Viet Nam has more than \n97  banks,  evidence  of  an  increasingly  crowded  financial  system  structure \naccording to the International Monetary Fund.13 The country\u2019s financial sector is \ndominated, however, by five large state-owned banks representing approximately \nhalf of total assets and market share. The sector has low capital adequacy and \nhigh gross nonperforming loans by International Financial Reporting Standards \n                                                \n6 T. Yang and T.

Moreover, given the number of unsustainable business models \nprevalent in the system, banks as well as institutions from the rising nonbank \nsector need to improve governance by creating proper incentives and improving \noperational  efficiency.  Meanwhile,  greater  emphasis  is  needed  on  financial \ninclusion. The main institutions providing microfinance services in Viet Nam are \nthe state-owned banks and community-based cooperatives. Given the growth of \nthe economy and the financial sector, reform and innovation is needed to meet \nthe demand from the under-banked segment.  \n(iii)  Myanmar. This country presents a special case in the region-having closed its \ndoors to foreign investors in 1960. As the country opens, its rudimentary banking \nsystem  will  need  broad-scale  capacity  development  to  meet  the  projected \ndemands of its growing economy.15  Today, the economy is still largely cash-\nbased, and only a few banks have recently introduced automated teller machines. \nBanks are only starting to establish wire transfer systems and relationships with \ncorrespondent banks. Confidence in the banking sector is quite low. Capacity \ndevelopment is thus needed on multiple levels. \n(iv)  Pacific developing member countries. Banks in the Pacific DMCs also have \nvaried development needs. In 2013, Papua New Guinea\u2019s ratio of domestic credit \nprovided by the private sector to GDP was 34.9% and Timor-Leste\u2019s was 11.3% \n(footnote 4). Multilateral development banks have worked to improve supervisory \nfunctions of the banking sector in Pacific DMCs by defining legal structures and \nimplementing appropriate regulatory frameworks. Given the geography of the \nislands,  an  emphasis  is  being  placed  on  the  development  of  innovative \nbranchless banking solutions and the ability to create more suitable banking \nproducts and processes (e.g., the ability for borrowers to pledge movable assets \nas collateral for loans).16 Further initiatives are needed to improve access to \nfinancial services by working with banks and nonbank lenders to reduce the high \ntransaction costs associated with providing banking to dispersed populations, \nand building more financial services around insurance.17 \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n6.  Selection criteria.  ADB will identify and select the qualified financial institutions (QFIs) \nbased on the following criteria:   \n(i)  The QFI should be a regulated financial institution (either private or public without \na government guarantee) and the target of an ADB nonsovereign investment. \n(ii)  The QFI\u2019s top management should be committed to pursuing innovative business \npractices and strengthening business operations. \n(iii)  The QFI\u2019s management will put into place a project team to oversee the TA and \nagrees to share up to 50% of the TA cost.18  \n                                                \n14 IMF. 2012.

Country selection. The TA will cover financial institutions in all countries in SEAP. \nGiven the variations in the financial sector across ADB\u2019s DMCs in SEAP, needs assessments \nwill  be  based  on  PSOD\u2019s  evaluations,  country  partnership  strategies,  private  sector \nassessments, and third-party research.19  \n  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The impact will be the enhanced capacity of selected financial institutions in the following \nareas:  (i)  corporate  governance;  know-your-client  policies;  and  AML,  antiterrorism, \ncounterterrorist financing, and anticorruption efforts; (ii) financing strategy, including product \ndevelopment  with  respect  to  onlending  to  microfinance  borrowers,  SMEs,  housing, \ninfrastructure, education and renewable energy, insurance, and leasing; (iii) risk management; \nand  (iv)  environmental  and  social  safeguards  policies  and  practices.  The  outcome  will  be \nstrengthened policies and procedures to ensure improved corporate governance and extended \nreach into the microfinance, SME, housing, mobile banking, infrastructure, education, leasing, \nand/or insurance markets. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The methodology and key activities of the TA are dependent upon the capacity needs of \nthe QFIs as evaluated by PSOD during the due diligence for the ADB funding or guarantees. \nGiven the tailored nature of the TA, not all of the key activities noted below will be undertaken. \nLikely activities include the following:  \n(i)  improving corporate governance and internal controls;  \n(ii)  strengthening AML, anticorruption policies and antiterrorism policies; \n(iii)  developing    and  strengthening  innovative  financing  strategies,  including  new \nproduct development;  \n(iv)  improving risk management; and  \n(v)  maintaining or introducing an environmental and social management system. \n \n10.  The outputs will be accomplished through training and capacity building. Appendix 3 \nprovides the outline terms of reference for consultants. \n \n11.  The TA will also support regional seminars to share experiences and results, and solicit \nfeedback for possible future interventions. Training programs will be held throughout the region \n                                                \n19 ADB. 2013. Country Partnership Strategy: Thailand, 2013\u20132016; ADB. 2012.

The TA is estimated to cost $1,200,000, of which (i) $750,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources), and (ii) $450,000 will \nbe financed on a grant basis by QFIs and administered by ADB.20Details are provided in the \n \ncost estimates and financing plan (Appendix 2). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  The TA will be executed and implemented by ADB, with PSOD as the focal point.21 ADB, \nthrough PSOD, will be responsible for all technical implementation issues. Disbursements under \nthe TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time). The TA will be implemented over 36 months from the \nstart date, coinciding with the approval date of the TA, and will adhere to the following: \n(i)  In accordance with Article 14(iii) of the ADB Charter, any activity under the TA \nwill begin only after receiving a no-objection letter from the government of the \ncountry in which the QFI is located.22  \n(ii)  The TA activities will be implemented with the help of international and national \nconsultants and consultancy firms. Details are provided in the outline terms of \nreference for consultants (Appendix 3). \n(iii)  ADB  and  each  TA  recipient  will  form  a  project  planning  and  coordination \ncommittee  comprising  representatives  drawn from  appropriate  levels  of  each \nfinancial institution and ADB. Participating financial institutions will be selected in \naccordance with criteria recommended by the consultants and agreed by PSOD, \nbroadly based on the each institution\u2019s business line, historic project pipeline and \nportfolio, and commitment to participate. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n14.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $450,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by qualified financial institutions, and (ii) ADB providing the balance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis for Promoting Capacity Building in \nFinancial Institutions in Emerging Countries in Southeast Asia and the Pacific and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.  \n                                                \n20 Part of the cost of implementing the TA will be borne by the selected financial institution. On an individual basis and \nas determined by PSOD, ADB may require the TA recipient to fund up to  50% of the TA costs with the exception of \nsmaller and new financial institutions. \n21 ADB may delegate parts of the TA to selected QFIs in compliance with ADB procedures and after consultation with \nADB\u2019s Operations Services and Financial Management Department. \n22 ADB. 1966.
