INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  At  the  14th  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  Ministerial \nConference,  a  joint  ministerial  statement endorsed  the  common  agenda  for  Sanitary  and \nPhytosanitary  (SPS)  Reforms  and  Modernization  in  Ulaanbaatar,  Mongolia,  in  September \n2015.1 The endorsement emanated from technical assistance (TA) from Asian Development \nBank (ADB) for Promoting Cooperation in Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures for Central Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation for trade facilitation in CAREC member countries (CMCs).2 \nThis proposed regional capacity development TA will support CMCs\u2019 implementation of food \nsafety to international standards along agricultural value-chain systems.3 The expected impact, \noutcome, and outputs of the proposed TA were explained to the delegates from 11 CMCs at the \n23rd Trade Policy Coordination Committee Meeting in Islamabad, Pakistan, on 18 July 2016. \nFollowing the briefing, a regional food safety initiative was launched at the CAREC senior official \nmeeting. Its progress will be reported at the CAREC\u2019s senior official and ministerial meetings. \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.   Increased globalization of trade, climate change, and intensification of agriculture have \nreduced the resilience of agricultural production systems and increased their vulnerability to \npests,  diseases,  and  hazardous  substances.  During  1980\u20132010,  international  trade  in \nagricultural and food products increased from $230 billion to almost $1,100 billion\u2014a more than \nfourfold increase. The expansion of trade also brought high-profile food safety scares, like the \nbovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease) problem in the European Union, or the E. \ncoli outbreak in the western United States and in Asia. In the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), \nsix infants died and 300,000 babies were affected with painful kidney stones after drinking \nmelamine-tainted infant milk formula in 2008.4 The World Health Organization estimates that \n600 million\u2014almost 1 in 10 people in the world\u2014fall ill after eating contaminated food and \n420,000 die every year.5 A single event of foodborne disease outbreak can result in huge \neconomic losses and cause a collapse of consumer confidence, loyalty, and reputations of \ncompanies and countries. The impact of food safety scares on international trade can be \ndevastating. Food safety issues are playing an increasingly dominant role in domestic food \nproduction and consumption systems, and in agro-food trade.6  \n \n3.  The  international  trade  in  food  products  is  regulated  with  ever  more  stringent \nrequirements.  The  SPS  Agreement  of  the  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO)  obliges  the \ncountries to harmonize the requirements with the international standards for food safety and \nanimal and plant health. The standards set by the Codex Alimentarius Commission are the \ninternational reference for the WTO food safety measures along the value chain. The World \nAnimal  Health  Organization  and  the  International  Plant  Protection  Convention  each  set \nstandards. All standards are closely linked and those on food safety measures have spillover \n                                                \n1  The meeting was represented by 10 CAREC member countries: Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, the People's Republic of \nChina, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.

Geneva: World Trade Organization.    \n ", "2   \neffects on animal and plant health.7 These international norms apply regardless of whether a \ncountry is a WTO member. Also, a country is not allowed to impose higher standards on \nimported products than those applied to domestic produce.8 \n \n4.  International food safety standards in member countries. The CMCs strategically \nlocated at crossroads in Asia and Europe have the potential to substantially increase trade \nacross central Asia. Trade in high-value products in the region\u2014fruits, vegetables, meat, and \ndairy\u2014increased from 32% in 1980 to 41% in 2010, the highest increase among food products. \nThese  are  highly  perishable  products  that  pose  serious  food  safety  risks  if  proper  safety \nstandards are not followed during production, processing, transportation, and all the way to \nconsumption.  The  movement  of  perishable  products  through  border-crossing  points  in  the \nCMCs is considerably delayed by multiple regulatory inspections and clearance procedures \nrelated to food safety. Such inefficiencies are costly and hamper international trade significantly. \nThe International Finance Corporation states that a key hurdle for Central Asian countries to \nincrease exports of primary and processed food products to the markets of the European Union, \nRussia, and the PRC is the slow adoption of internationally recognized food safety standards.  \n \n5.  Moreover, different levels of food safety standards currently practiced among CMCs are \nequivalent to nontariff barriers that restrict trade. Harmonizing standards and regulations and \nexpediting border-crossing procedures with other CMCs and global markets can yield significant \nbenefits. Single-window facilities for processing entry and exit customs formalities, automated \ncustoms information systems, and coordinated management of border clearance procedures \ncan  be  effective  in  avoiding  duplication  and  overlap  across  various  customs  agencies. \nEstablishing these measures will yield substantial benefits. The World Bank estimates that each \nday of delay from harvest to market corresponds to 0.8% of tariff equivalent.9   \n \n6.  All CMCs engage in agro-food export and import. Incorporating harmonized international \nfood safety standards in domestic systems provides protection from import sources and can \nalso reduce imports. For example, urban populations in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan now \nprefer imported frozen and processed meat, dairy products, and vegetables from countries \nperceived to have high food safety standards.   \n \n7.  Compliance  with  international  food  safety  standards  requires  investments  in  the \ndevelopment of capacity, institutionalization of regulations, upgrades to infrastructure facilities, \naccreditation  of  laboratories,  coordination  between  government  ministries  (i.e.,  agriculture, \nenvironment,  health,  trade,  customs,  and  border-crossing  entities),  and  procedures  and \nincentive structures to develop the private sector. For small farmers to benefit from international \nagro-food  trade,  investments  in  farm  infrastructure,  producer  associations,  and  third-party \nquality control are also important.10 These high investment needs are a contributing factor in the \n                                                \n7  The International Plant Protection Convention develops measures to control pests and pathogens of plants, but any \npesticides to be used in plant protection are evaluated scientifically by the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization \nof the United Nations (FAO) and WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues. The Joint FAO and WHO Expert Committee \non Food Additives and Contaminants evaluates the veterinary drug needed to protect animal health, whereas the \nJoint FAO and WHO Expert Meeting on Microbiological Risk Assessment evaluates human health hazards arising \nfrom zoonotic pathogens associated with animals.  \n8  WTO member states have the right to adapt and deviate from these international benchmarks if stricter regulations \nare based on scientific principles of risk assessment in the interest of human, plant, and animal health.  \n9  The World Bank annually measures the progress of countries around the world in facilitating trade through the \nWorld Bank Logistics Performance Index and the Ease of Doing Business Index. These ratings indicate the overall \nperformance of countries in facilitating trade.  \n10 C.  B.  Barrett  et  al.    2009.

The standard-related investment needs of CMCs are \nparticularly high because they are transitioning from Soviet-era state standards that are not \ncompatible with the codex.11  \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the project is aligned with improved public health and facilitation of trade in \nagro-food  products  in  CMCs.  The  outcome  will  be  stronger  institutional  systems  for  the \noperationalization of international food safety standards.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  CMCs\u2019 compliance with the main food safety principles and mechanisms varies greatly. \nHence, two tiers of support should be provided to CMCs (i.e., groups I and II) based on their \nprogress in aligning regulations and systems with the international food safety standards. Five \ncountries are in group 1: Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, and Tajikistan.12 \nGroup 1 countries are members of the codex and, except for Azerbaijan, are also members of \nthe WTO. However, their adoption of the international food safety measures has been slower \nthan in other countries.  \n \n10.  Group 2 countries are Georgia, the PRC, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and Uzbekistan. They \nare members of the codex commission and, except for Uzbekistan, are also members of the \nWTO.  Their regulations and infrastructure facilities are more advanced than those in other \nCMCs, and are aligned with international food safety standards. The PRC and Kazakhstan, in \nmost cases, have the recommended standard equipment and procedures and internationally \naccredited laboratories. In Mongolia, ADB approved a loan in 2015 to help modernize SPS \nstandards.13 Although Uzbekistan is not a WTO member, it has aligned its food safety standards \nwith the international norms.  Four outputs are expected by TA completion.  \n \n11.  Output 1: Regulations for meeting international food safety standards developed. \nIntegrated national food safety legislation and strategies for implementing the international food \nsafety standards will be developed for the group 1 countries that have not yet initiated the \nprocess. The national strategies will aim to (i) establish a national food safety unit consisting of \ngovernment and private sector representatives, (ii) designate an agency to set food safety \nstandards, and (iii) designate a separate, certificate-issuing agency with a mandate to verify \ncompliance. Activities envisioned for this output are to develop national food safety legislation \nand strategies for Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, and Pakistan.14 \n \n                                                \n11 Russia\u2019s accession to the WTO in 2012 obligates the country to replace its Soviet-era state standards with the \ncodex. This in turn forces other former Soviet Union countries to adopt the codex to continue to trade with their \ntraditional and new trading partners.  \n12 Turkmenistan also falls under group 1 but it is not included for outputs 1 and 2 because ADB has approved \nseparate TA on food safety (ADB. Turkmenistan: Modernization of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures for Food \nSafety. https://www.adb.org/projects/49343-001/main). Under this regional TA, Turkmenistan will be included for \noutputs 3 and 4, which were not covered under the Turkmenistan TA.  \n13 ADB. 2015. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to Mongolia \nfor Regional Upgrades of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures for Trade Project. Manila.  \n14 Tajikistan is developing its national food safety law, while the Kyrgyz Republic is crafting its law on food safety. \nThese documents are in their draft stage. The TA may help finalize the laws and strategies as appropriate.   \n ", "4   \n12.  Output 2: Laboratory rationalization and infrastructure requirements for applying \ninternational food safety standards identified. Adopting international food safety standards \ninvolves adopting preventive measures along the food chain. Infrastructure required to apply \nregulations  and  guidelines  includes  laboratories  to  test  products  for  compliance  with  the \ninternational food safety standards and a referral laboratory for providing services such as \nreference  material  for  performance  testing,  quality  assurance,  and  for  performing  special \nanalysis. At the import control border, facilities for rapid field tests will be made for further testing \nat the referral laboratories, if needed. Activities envisioned for output 2 include (i) identifying a \ncentral laboratory that can be upgraded to a referral laboratory with international accreditation \n(International  Organization  for  Standardization  17025:2005);15and    (ii)  indicative    costing \ninfrastructure, laboratory equipment, and other logistic systems. \n \n13.  Output 3: Capacity of value chain actors to implement food safety to international \nstandards  strengthened.  Institutional  capacity  constraints  are  major  obstacles  to  the \nenforcement of international food safety standards. The market structure in most CMCs is \nlayered and involves different food safety managements\u2014international export market, emerging \ndomestic market based on food supply chains, and traditional markets. Different strategies are \nrequired to develop safety standards to improve these systems.  \n \n14.  The  capacity  development  output  will  provide  training,  workshops,  and  networking \nopportunities to strengthen inter-CMC cooperation. Technicians and officials will be instructed in \nregional workshops to train their country\u2019s key value chain operators.16  \n \n15.  Output 4: CAREC food safety network developed. In 2015, CMCs have given higher \npriority to food security issues. Harmonizing internationally accredited food safety parameters \nacross CMCs for credibility and consistency of quality control is highly desired. Economy of \nscale  and  similarity  in  agro-climate  and  ecosystems  reinforce  the  importance  of  regional \nharmonization. The regional food safety initiative would be a launch pad to set up the CAREC \nfood safety network. Such a network could be instrumental in regional cooperation to harmonize \nstandards and regulations governing agro-food trade; expedite border-crossing procedures; and \nmanage  transboundary  contaminations,  diseases,  and  pests.  The  network  could  support \nharmonization of standards, technical regulations, conformity assessment regimes, and sharing \nof information to build capacity in food inspection and certification.   \n \n16.    The European  Food Safety Authority and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations\u2019 \nFood Safety Network could be models for the CAREC food safety network. The network could \nhelp carry out food safety risk assessments, which require multidisciplinary expertise that not all \ncountries may have. The CMCs\u2019 national referral laboratories could provide analytical services \nto other members in the network, so that each country need not invest in equipment that may \nnot be used daily.  \n \n17.  To further support the achievement of the above outputs, ADB plans to carry out the \nfollowing  activities  subject  to  compliance  with  the  required  procedures  and  approvals:  (i) \ndevelop key code of practices and guidelines; (ii) develop national food safety network unit to \nstrengthen the implementation of the international food safety standards; (iii) develop an  action \nplan for the CAREC food safety network; (iv) develop plans for national and regional referral \n                                                \n15 ISO/IEC 17025:2005 (en). General Requirements for the Competence of Testing and Calibration Laboratories. \nhttps://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:17025:ed-2:v1:en. \n16 The operators would be encouraged to form an Association of Primary Producers, Association of Food Processors, \nand Association of Food Importers and Exporters. These associations would be encouraged to share information \nand provide training to operators of member producers or processors.  \n ", "  5 \nlaboratories, including a plan for border inspection laboratories accreditation and an audit plan; \n(v)  conduct  in-country  and  regional  training  to  technician  and  value  chain  inspectors  (i.e., \ngovernment officials and private sectors) to effectively implement good hygienic practices, food \nsafety traceability, and hazard analysis and critical control point; and (vii) conduct regional \nworkshops, study tours for knowledge sharing among developing countries, and networking and \nfinalization of the TA.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Others). Subject to compliance with the required \nprocedures and approvals, ADB plans to secure additional financing in the amount of $1.5 \nmillion to further support the outputs of the TA.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The TA will be implemented over 2.5 years (March 2017\u2013August 2019). ADB will be the \nexecuting agency through the Environment, Natural Resources, and Agriculture Division of the \nCentral and West Asia Department. The agriculture or health ministries of the respective CMCs \nwill be the implementing agencies. The implementing agencies will form and lead a steering \ncommittee consisting of agencies and ministries from agriculture, commerce, health, trade, and \ncustoms, as well as cross-border agencies. The CAREC Institute will be a hub for training and \nworkshops. The International Atomic Energy Agency will provide technical advice and support in \nits areas of expertise for outputs 3 and 4. The support will be provided through expert missions, \nas well as individual and group training and workshops, and facilitate harmonization of analytical \ntechniques.  Other  international  agencies  will  also  be  consulted,  and  opportunities  for  joint \nactivities will be explored.  \n \n20.  An international firm or consortium of specialist agencies will be recruited to implement \nthe TA. ADB will recruit a team of consultants using the quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10 and simplified technical proposals. Implementation \nrequires 15 person-months of international and 25 person-months of national consultants. The \nreporting requirements include inception, interim, and final reports. The terms of reference are in \nAppendix 3. \n \n21.  The TA proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). All procurement will be carried \nout in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time), \nand consultants will be recruited in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, \nas amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis for \nStrengthening International Food Safety Standards in Agricultural Value Chains in the Central \nAsia Regional Economic Cooperation Member Countries, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard.   \n ", "6     Appendix 1      \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned With: \nImproved public health and facilitation of trade in agro-food products in CMCs.a     \n \nResults Chain  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and  Risks \nwith Targets and Baselines  Reporting \nOutcome        \n       \nStronger institutional  a.
