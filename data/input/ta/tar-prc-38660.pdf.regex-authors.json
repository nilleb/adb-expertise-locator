During  the  October  2004  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  of  the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  technical  assistance  (TA)1  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant-financed assistance for \npreparing the Ningxia Yinchuan Integrated Ecosystem Management Project. After receiving \nADB Management\u2019s endorsement of the concept for this TA, the Fact-Finding Mission in March \n2005 held discussions with the government of Ningxia-Hui Autonomous Region (NHAR), and \nreached an understanding on the detailed objectives, scope, cost estimates, terms of reference \nfor consultants, and financing and implementation arrangements for the TA to prepare the \nProject.  The  Project  will  support  the  NHAR  government  in  restoring  and  protecting \nenvironmental and economic services in the Yinchuan-Helan Mountains areas, via an integrated \necosystem management (IEM) approach. The Project is in environmental category B and will \nneed an initial environmental evaluation.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The requested TA is under the Country Programming Framework (CPF) for the PRC-\nGEF Partnership on Land Degradation in Dryland Ecosystems (the Partnership). The CPF was \ndescribed in a Framework Brief that was approved by the GEF Council in October 2002.2 The \nCPF covers a programmatic approach for a 10-year period (2003\u20132012) and seeks to combat \nland  degradation,  reduce  poverty,  and  conserve  biodiversity  through  capacity-building \ninvestments and developing viable model demonstration investment projects, consistent with \nGEF\u2019s  Operational  Program  12  (OP12)  on  IEM.  The  initial  focus  (2003\u20132005)  is  on  six \nprovinces/autonomous regions in the western region that are both national priority areas and of \nglobal significance for land degradation control and biodiversity preservation. During 2006\u2013\n2012, all western region provinces/regions will be eligible.3 In aggregate, investments worth $1.5 \nbillion are planned, including $150 million in GEF grants.  \n \n3.  ADB\u2019s  first  project  under  the  Partnership,  the  Capacity  Building  to  Combat  Land \nDegradation Project4, is ongoing in six provinces/autonomous regions: Gansu Province, Inner \nMongolia Autonomous Region, NHAR, Qinghai Province, Shaanxi Province, and the Xinjiang \nUygur Autonomous Region.  Its initial focus is for each province/region to (i) prepare its own \nstrategic plan for land degradation control, using an IEM approach; (ii) review relevant policy \nand legislative/regulatory conditions; (iii) strengthen national and provincial coordination and \nimprove operational arrangements at provincial and county levels; (iv) support the capacity for \n                                                 \n1 Previously titled, Technical Assistance for Preparing the Shaanxi Qinling Integrated Ecosystem Management \nProject and the Ningxia Yinchuan Integrated Ecosystem Management Project. Following the Government\u2019s request \nin early June 2005, the preparation of the two projects was described in two separate TAs. The TA first appeared in \nADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 18 April 2005. \n2  ADB.  2002.  People\u2019s  Republic  Of  China  (PRC)-Global  Environment  Facility  (GEF)  Partnership  on  Land \nDegradation in Dryland Ecosystems, Framework Brief, September. \n3  Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia Hui, Qinghai, Shaanxi, and Xinjiang Uygur with a population of about 120 million. \nThe other six provinces/regions to be included from 2006 are Chongqing, Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Xizang \nYunnan, Zizhiqu, and two prefectures in Hubei and Hunan. Eleven central government agencies are involved: \nLegislative Office of the State Council, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Land and Resources, \nMinistry of Science and Technology, Ministry of Water Resources, National Development and Reform Commission, \nPoverty  Alleviation  Office  of  the  State  Council,  State  Environmental  Protection  Agency,  State  Forestry \nAdministration, and the Working Committee for Legislation of the National People\u2019s Congress. \n4 ADB. 2004.

Manila, for $1.2 million.  \n ", "2 \nfuture  IEM  investment  projects;5  (v)  examine  ways  of  improving  and  coordinating  existing \nmonitoring and evaluation systems; and (vi) support project implementation. An international \nworkshop on integrated ecosystem management held in Beijing on 1\u20132 November 2004, aimed \nto introduce to the Government the concepts and principles of IEM and to promote mutual \nunderstanding of how the approach could contribute to combating the root causes of land \ndegradation.6  \n \n4.  The  PRC\u2019s  western  region  shares  a  common  border  with  several  Central  Asian \nrepublics,  where  land  degradation  has  serious  economic,  social,  and  environmental \nconsequences. As in the dryland areas of the PRC, the causes of land degradation are multiple, \ncomplex, and varied, but are largely attributable to overexploitation of the natural resource base. \nSimilar problems exist in the western region, and hence lessons learned from the Partnership \nare highly relevant for ongoing operations in Central Asia7 and elsewhere. \n \n5.   Demonstration Investment Projects Under the Partnership. Several demonstration \ninvestment projects are under way or are being planned. The World Bank is implementing the \nGansu-Xinjiang Pastoral Development Project ($66.25 million loan and $10.5 million GEF grant) \nand has several other Partnership projects in its forward lending pipeline. The International \nFund for Agricultural Development has a Partnership project currently under preparation for \nGansu, Ningxia and Shaanxi provinces. ADB\u2019s 2006\u20132008 program includes six projects that \nare anticipated to involve a combination of loans and GEF grants; of these, several are under \nthe Partnership.8 The TA will help prepare ADB\u2019s first loan/GEF grant demonstration investment \nunder the Partnership.  \n \n6.  Ningxia\u2013Yinchuan IEM Project. To the north of the extremely poor and dry NHAR, with \nthe Yellow River to the east and the Helan Mountains as its western boundary, the proposed \nproject area sits close to the capital city, Yinchuan.9 The close correlation between dryland \ndegradation, poverty, and rapid population growth, as in NHAR, has been well documented.10 \nBetween 1980 and 2000, the NHAR population increased from 3.73 million to 5.54 million, or by \n48.3% in 20 years. By comparison, the population of the Hui minority in NHAR increased from \n1.17 million to 1.91 million, or by 63.6% during the same period. The project area is naturally \ndivided  into  three.  (i)  The  foothills  and  the  central  Yinchuan  plain  contain  most  of  the \n                                                 \n5  This includes (i) documenting IEM/land degradation control-related projects and programs, (ii) learning the lessons \nfrom past successes and failures by assessing the impact of past investments, (iii) training a cadre of provincial \nplanners with the skills required to design land degradation control investment projects, and (iv) undertaking \nfeasibility  studies  of  selected  priority  IEM/land  degradation  control  project  investments  eligible  for  possible \nfinancing under the Partnership.  \n6  Over 200 participants attended, including keynote speakers, as well as senior representatives from (i) central and \nprovincial governments; (ii) international development agencies (including ADB, European Union, Food and \nAgriculture Organization, Global Environment Facility [GEF], United Nations Development Programme [UNDP], \nand World Bank), and bilateral development assistance agencies from Australia, Canada, and Japan;  (iii) \nnongovernment organizations; and (iv) private sector companies. Publication of the workshop proceedings is \nexpected by October 2005.  \n7  Two similar GEF-supported initiatives in Central Asia are (i) the UNEP project Sustainable Land Management in \nthe High Pamir and Pamir-Alai Mountain\u2015an Integrated and Transboundary Initiative; and (ii) ADB. 2005. Regional \nTechnical Assistance for the Central Asian Countries Initiative for Land Management. Manila. \n8  ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program Update. Manila. \n9  The project area covers 3,350 square kilometers, including three districts and two counties of Yinchuan City. The \ntotal population (including that of Yinchuan City) is about 1.33 million, of whom 630,000 live in rural areas. In 2004, \nthe average annual urban income was CNY7,200 ($887.79) while the average annual per capita rural income was \nCNY3,080 ($379.78), at approximately the poverty level on a $1/day basis.  \n10 For data, see Framework Brief and ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the \nCapacity Building to Combat Land Degradation Project. Manila. These sources note that the poor become \nincreasingly vulnerable when human and animal populations have expanded well beyond the natural capacity of \ndryland ecosystems. Women tend to suffer more than men in terms of health, nutrition, employment, and income. \n ", "       3 \npredominantly  poor  rural  population,  where  traditional  farming  technologies  and  practices \ndominate, and land degradation is increasing. Limited commercial agribusiness exists, linked to \nthe local community through contract growing and marketing. Some expansion on suitable \nareas is possible. Despite fragile soils that can easily become saline if poorly managed and are \nlargely devoid of nutrients due to overcultivation and use of all vegetative matter for animal feed \nand fuel, the area is rich in biodiversity, with many rare or endangered species,  (ii) Wetlands \nand lakes, feature many rare bird species. Yinchuan City government has invested in these \nareas for tourism and environmental protection,  (iii) The massive Tengri (Gobi) and Mao Wushu \n(Ordos) deserts, threaten the oasis of the Yinchuan Plain with moving dunes. The Government \nhas  taken  some  effective  control  measures  to  protect  roads,  railways,  towns,  rivers,  and \nfarmland from these deserts. The Yellow River is heavily polluted and groundwater in Yinchuan \nCity is declining; however, very limited use has been made of market-based mechanisms, such \nas water pricing, to allocate and conserve water resources.  \n \n7.  To protect the environment, the Helan Mountains have been closed to grazing, fuel \ngathering, and hunting. The Government now wishes to combat land degradation through an \nIEM approach to the planned use of natural resources, promotion of sustainable agricultural \npractices including conservation agriculture, prevention of further desertification and to take \nsteps toward the recovery of healthy soils, and increased farm productivity. Under the Project, \nthe activities will involve (i) strategy development and institutional capacity building; (ii) rational \nuse of water and land resources to balance the competing demands from the expanding urban \nsector and rural users; and (iii) expansion of agriculture on suitable areas, alternative livelihood \ndevelopment, habitat protection and restoration, biodiversity conservation, renewable energy \noptions,  carbon  sequestration,  and  improved  ecosystem  monitoring.  Although  the  basic \ninfrastructure exists, tourism contributes little to the economy due to lack of promotion and \nlimited investment to capitalize on the region\u2019s potential. However, tourism has a good potential \nas a commercial engine for NHAR. The Project complies with the project-specific eligibility \ncriteria, as described in the Partnership\u2019s Framework Brief.11  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome  \n8.  The impact of the Ningxia-Yinchuan Project will be restored productive and protective \nfunctions of the ecosystem resources of the Yinchuan area. To achieve this impact, the TA will \nproduce  a  feasibility  study  to  design  an  IEM  approach  for  the  sustainable  use  of  natural \nresources in the Yinchuan area. The design outputs will be (i) an assessment of the enabling \nconditions for an IEM approach, including policies, regulations, and incentives; (ii) appropriate \ninstitutional  arrangements  for  the  Project,  including  for  capacity  building;  (iii)  sustainable \ncommercial agriculture, including conservation agriculture, alternative means of livelihood, and \nwater resources management; (iv) interventions for habitat restoration, wetlands protection, \necotourism,  biodiversity  conservation,  carbon  sequestration,  and  management  and \ncommercialization  of  wildlife;  and  (v)  an  ecosystem  monitoring  system.  The  design  and \n                                                 \n11 Project-specific criteria cover (i) enabling legal and regulatory framework to enhance incentives and enforcement \nmechanisms  for  improved  ecosystem  management;  (ii)  an  integrated  and  participatory  approach  to  foster \nincreased coordination among line agencies; (iii) local communities and stakeholders which are involved in \nidentifying, designing, implementing, and monitoring; (iv) pilot-testing innovative and coordinated institutional \narrangements, technology systems, land use planning, adaptive management approaches, and public\u2013private \npartnerships;  and  (v)  achieving  synergy  among  biodiversity  conservation,  carbon  sequestration,  and  land \ndegradation  control  through  sustainable  agriculture  and  rural  development,  emphasizing  local  benefits  and \nsustainable livelihoods.  \n \n ", "4 \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1, and Appendix 2 gives the initial poverty and social \nanalysis. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The NHAR government has agreed that the Project will be designed in a participatory \nway using an IEM approach. To address the global impacts, a GEF grant will add to the \nfeasibility study in the following areas: (i) enabling environment, policy and institutional reforms, \nand capacity building to ensure an IEM approach is followed; (ii) strategies/assessments and \nrecommended  investments  in  habitat  restoration,  land  degradation  control,  biodiversity \nconservation, carbon sequestration, grasslands, wetlands, management and commercialization \nof  indigenous  wildlife and  plants,  environmentally  sensitive  tourism;  and  (iii)  environmental \nawareness with regard to options for conservation and profitable use of ecosystem resources \nand monitoring of global benefits. The ongoing work of the Capacity Building to Combat Land \nDegradation Project (footnote 4) will support an IEM approach under the future investment \nproject. 12  \n  \n10.  The key design activities of the TA and GEF project are as follows: (i) review and \nanalysis of the enabling conditions, including policies, regulations, and incentives for sustainable \ndevelopment and pro-poor economic growth; (ii) institutional arrangements required for an IEM \napproach,  including  public\u2013private  roles  and  partnerships,  capacity  building,  and  overseas \nstudy/training; (iii) sustainable agriculture, including conservation agriculture measures in the \ncentral plain, salinity control, integrated pest and plant nutrient management, windbreaks and \nerosion control measures, expansion of the area under perennial economic crops (e.g., grapes, \nwolfberry, Chinese dates), forage, shed-based livestock, and greenhouses on suitable sites; \n(iv) development  of  alternative  sources  of  rural  livelihood,  and  processing  and  marketing \nsupport  services;  (v)  improved  water  resources  management,  water  balance  studies, \ngroundwater  recharge,  and  improved  storage  and  irrigation  practices;  (vi)  biodiversity \nconservation,  carbon  sequestration,  wildlife  habitat  protection  and \nmanagement/commercialization  of  wildlife  through  the  development  of  a  commercial  zoo, \necological and cultural tourism, public environmental education, and related facilities/services; \nand (vii) an ecosystem monitoring system.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $1.2 million equivalent, comprising $517,000 \nin foreign exchange and $683,000 equivalent in local currency. The TA will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program ($500,000) and a GEF grant ($350,000 equivalent) \nadministered by ADB. ADB will finance $308,000 to cover the foreign exchange cost and \n$192,000 equivalent of the local cost. GEF will finance $209,000 of the foreign exchange cost \nand $141,000 equivalent of the local cost. The Government will provide $350,000 equivalent of \nlocal costs, to cover in-kind counterpart costs and services. The Government has been informed \nthat  approval  of  the  TA  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  any  ensuing  project.  The  cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  The  institutional  arrangements  and  activities  already  in  place  for  implementing  the \n                                                 \n12\n As  incorporated  into  a  number  of  international  conventions  on  environment  and  development,  integrated \necosystem management (IEM) is a holistic approach to addressing the links between ecosystem functions and \nservices (such as carbon uptake and storage, climatic stabilization and watershed protection, and medicinal \nproducts) and human social, economic, and production systems. IEM recognizes that people and the natural \nresources they depend upon, directly or indirectly, such as land, water, and forests, are inextricably linked.  \n ", "       5 \nCapacity  Building  to  Combat  Land  Degradation  Project  will support  the  preparation  of  the \nProject. The Executing Agency will be the Foreign Debt Management Office of the NHAR \ngovernment. A Leading Group (LG) chaired by the responsible vice-governor, will coordinate the \ninvolved agencies. The LG will include the Yinchuan City government. A project management \noffice (PMO) will provide administrative support and expertise in plant and animal biology, \neconomics, finance, tourism, management, marketing, legal and regulatory aspects, information \ntechnology,  and  other  needed  professionals.  Responsibilities  of  the  PMO  include  (i)  work \nplanning, (ii) administrative support, (iii) financial management, (iv) facilitation of LG meetings, \n(v) project information dissemination, and (vi) regular liaison with involved agencies. The PMO \nwill engage 8\u201310 permanent employees to support the Project. An expert panel will provide \ntechnical guidance to the PMO and the consultants and be paid an honorarium. \n \n13.  The TA will be carried out over 8 months starting in October 2005 and ending in June \n2006. A total of 60 person-months of consulting services will be required: 21 international and \n39 domestic. ADB will finance 41 person-months of consulting services: 13 international and 28 \ndomestic. GEF will finance 8 person-months of international and 11 of domestic consultants. \nThe consultants will work as an integrated team, under the leadership of the IEM specialist. The \ninternational  consultants  will  also  have  expertise  in  project  economics,  water  resources \nmanagement,  sustainable  agriculture,  wildlife  management,  commercialization  and  tourism, \nwetlands management, and carbon sequestration/clean development mechanism. The domestic \nconsultants  will  have  expertise  in  project  economics  and  finance,  dryland  ecosystems, \nsustainable  agriculture,  rural  livelihoods,  livestock  husbandry,  water  resources,  renewable \nenergy, social development, environmental aspects, legal and institutional aspects, species \nsurveys, tourism, and wetlands management. A firm will be engaged by ADB in accordance with \nits  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for \nengaging domestic consultants. The selection process will follow ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based \nselection method, following simplified technical proposal procedures. Consultants with special \nexpertise  such  as  wildlife  management,  commercialization  and  tourism,  and  carbon \nsequestration/clean development mechanism, may be engaged as individuals. Equipment for \nthe  TA  will  be  procured  by  the  consultants  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement. Detailed terms of reference are in Appendix 4. \n \n14.  At the end of the first month, the consultant team will submit an inception report and a \nseminar and workshop plan to the Government and ADB, which will be discussed in a tripartite \nreview meeting. A midterm report will be submitted to the Government and ADB at the end of \nthe fourth month from the start of the TA, the findings of which will be discussed in a seminar or \nworkshop, participated in by stakeholders, in a second tripartite review meeting. A draft final \nreport (10 copies) will be submitted to the Government and ADB, 1 month before the end of the \nassignment, which will be presented by the consultant in the second seminar. A third tripartite \nreview meeting will be held before the TA ends to discuss the draft final report. The comments \ngenerated during the second seminar will be incorporated into the final report in English and in \nChinese (10 copies each), to be submitted to the Government and ADB at the end of the 8 \nmonths TA implementation period. \n \nIV.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): \nThe Country Strategy and Program for the PRC (2004\u20132006) outlines the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) strategy \nto support the Government\u2019s ongoing poverty reduction efforts. The majority of the poor live in the central and western \nprovinces that lag well behind the eastern provinces in achieving the Millenium Development Goals, and where \npoverty is strongly correlated with the incidence of land degradation. The majority of ADB\u2019s lending, particularly for \ninfrastructure, is targeted to the poor interior provinces to help create a climate for pro-poor economic growth. Ongoing \nADB-financed policy work is addressing poverty-related issues in health, education, social protection, nutrition, land \ndegradation, access to clean drinking water, and sanitation in rural areas. The program includes continued support for \nthe Government\u2019s fight against poverty by addressing environmental problems related to air, water, and land, and \npromoting rural development in mountainous areas in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (NHAR) and other western \nprovinces/autonomous regions. \n \nThe poverty partnership agreement, signed by the Government and ADB in September 2003, sets out strategies and \ninterventions for poverty reduction. PRC and ADB will continue to cooperate on a broad range of activities related to \npolicy and regulatory reform and capacity building in the environment sector, and support projects to address \nenvironment problems. Projects will be designed so that the poor capture some of the environmental benefits. To \nsharpen the poverty focus of environmental work, the PRC and ADB are addressing land degradation by supporting \nthe implementation of the 10-year ($150 million, grant-financed) PRC-Global Environment Facility (GEF) Partnership \nfor Degradation in Dryland Ecosystems to address policy, institutional, technical, and financing issues related to \ncombating land degradation. It aims to reduce poverty, arrest land degradation, and restore dryland ecosystems in the \nwestern region. \n \nThe project area has a total population (including that of Yinchuan City) of about 1.33 million, of whom 630,000 are in \nrural areas. In 2004, the average annual income of the urban residents was CNY7,200 ($887.79 equivalent) while the \naverage annual per capita income of the rural population of the project area was CNY3,080 ($379.78 equivalent, or \nabout the poverty line on an equivalent of $1/day). In recent years, most of the Helan Mountain area has been \ndesignated as natural reserve zone or enclosure zone for ecological protection, with stringent land use regulations \nbeing put in place. The Government has imposed a grazing ban. While the ban has increased the environmental value \nof the Helan Mountains, it has necessitated alternative livelihood and measures to compensate for the loss of \ntraditional access to grazing. Also, the Government sees increasing urbanization as being important for reducing \npoverty, and urban population growth is rapidly increasing. Hence, future urban and rural water demand needs to be \nassessed and balanced, and use of water resources must be carefully planned. The Project will provide the \nopportunity to achieve an improved enabling environment and institutional capacity building for a participatory and \ncommunity-oriented integrated ecosystem management approach to sustainable use of biodiversity, agriculture, and \nnatural resources for (i) water and land resources; (ii) conservation annual and perennial agriculture on suitable land \n(e.g., grapes, wolfberry, Chinese date, forage, etc.); and (iii) livelihood diversification for rural people\u2014many of whom \nare poor\u2014including tourism-based employment. An example will be provided for future projects planned under the \nPRC-GEF Partnership on Land Degradation. Ecosystem-based livelihood activities will include (i) irrigated annual crop \nand perennial/tree crops, (ii) greenhouse production, (iii) livestock production, (iv) tourism, and (v) aquaculture \nproduction. Large-scale commercial agriculture, with related agro-industrial processing, is taking place on a limited \nscale within the project area. Project interventions are likely to feature community-based programs in rural areas, and \npublic\u2013private partnerships, especially in commercial agriculture and tourism. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis        Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe total population of the project area (including Yinchuan City) is about 1.33 million, of whom 630,000 are in rural \nareas. In 2004, the average annual disposable income of the urban residents was CNY7,200 ($887.79) while the \naverage annual per capita income of the rural population of the project area was CNY3,080 ($379.18, or about the \npoverty level on a $1/day equivalent basis). Urban growth is significantly faster than rural growth, an important aspect \nof the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy. Poverty analysis will comprise the following: (i) rural and urban \nconsultations/surveys in all three ecosystems (Helan Mountains footslopes and central alluvial plain, wetlands and \nlakes, and deserts); (ii) participatory focus group discussions with vulnerable groups such as women, migratory \n ", "  Appendix 2  11 \ngroups, herders facing a grazing ban, and people living on the desert margins, to determine the linkage between \nincome, poverty, and non-income poverty and the environment; (iii) design of interventions in policy/planning, \nregulations, institutions, and physical investments to address water resources including conservation and pollution, \nproductivity improvements, including conservation agriculture, conservation of the environment and tourism. Public\u2013\nprivate partnerships will be an important aspect.  \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes   No  \n \nA brief stakeholder analysis was conducted during fact-finding for the technical assistance and the roles of the key \nstakeholders were identified and agreed upon in the signed Memorandum of Understanding. Based on detailed \ndiscussions with the NHAR government, Yinchuan City government, representatives of agribusiness ventures, cultural \nand ecotourism operations, and a small group of rural residents, the Leading Group (LG) will comprise director \ngeneral-level  officials  of  the  NHAR  Development  Reform  Commission,  Finance,  Agriculture,  Forestry,  Water \nResources, Poverty Alleviation Office, Environmental Protection Office, Tourism, and the Yinchuan City government. \nThe NHAR arrangements for implementing the ongoing PRC-GEF Partnership on Land Degradation will provide an \nopportunity to build capacity in project planning and implementation. A project management office (PMO) will provide \nadministrative support and have experts in plant and animal biology, economics, finance, tourism, management, \nmarketing, legal and regulatory aspects, information technology, and other needed professionals.  During the ADB \nproject preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) and the GEF Project Development Facility (PDF-B) those responsible \nfor preparing the full project proposal will consult fully with the above institutions, and make field visits to potential \nproject pilot/demonstration sites. The project components will be designed and reviewed through a process of \nstakeholder consultation involving concerned authorities and technical agencies at NHAR, Yinchuan City, and local \ngovernment levels, as well as NGOs and private sector bodies. A series of informal and formal consultations will be \nheld with representatives of the key project beneficiaries (including rural households engaged in crop and livestock \nproduction within the project area) to take into consideration their concerns and aspirations. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                 No \n \nTo strengthen the design, an expert panel will provide technical guidance to the PMO, the LG, and the consultant \nteam. The panel will comprise 6\u20138 senior scientists and experts on sustainable water resources management, \nforestry,  commercial  agriculture,  wildlife  management,  tourism,  geographic  information  systems,  conservation \nagriculture,  wetlands,  and  business  management  from  regional  and  national  universities  and  institutes.  Panel \nmembers will be paid a lump sum honorarium. In addition, participatory focus group discussions will be held with the \ncommunity, including vulnerable groups, and with private sector corporations to determine their interest and capacity \nto participate in the Project.  \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nGender analysis: Gender roles are determined by a combination of cultural factors, occupations, environmental \nconditions, education levels, and employment opportunities. Religious beliefs common to NHAR are an influence. \nDuring PPTA implementation, women\u2019s roles in the proposed project activities will be assessed, including those in \ninstitutional capacity building. The need for gender-specific groups, or other measures will be assessed. \n \nGender and development plan:  The Project will not have significant negative impacts on women, but a gender plan \nwill need to be developed given the fact that local staff have low gender sensitivity and lack the knowledge and skills \nfor gender analysis and planning. The gender plan will ensure equal participation of women. \n \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes     No \n \nThis will be prepared during the PPTA phase.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "12  Appendix 2 \n \nE.
