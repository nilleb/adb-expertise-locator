I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the National Capital Region Planning Board (NCRPB), to \nbe guaranteed by the Government of India, for the National Capital Region Urban Infrastructure \nFinancing Facility.  \n \n2.  The proposed MFF to NCRPB1 will establish the facility, which will develop regional and \ncity-specific urban infrastructure in India's National Capital Region (NCR) based on priorities set \nby the Regional Plan 2021. In addition, the facility's implementation support will enable NCRPB \nand various subborrowers to scale up effective and sustainable urban infrastructure services in \nthe NCR. 2 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  THE FACILITY \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The Indian economy has emerged as one of the fastest-growing world economies,3 and \nthis growth is likely to continue at a high rate.4 Urban areas in India are experiencing higher \npopulation  growth  rates,  among  others,  due  to  greater  economic  opportunities. 5  Urban \ninfrastructure  and  basic  services  are  under  stress  due  to  increasing  demand  from  the \nburgeoning urban population. However, by nature, urban infrastructure is complex and more \ndifficult to scale up than other infrastructure.6 Cities are unable to cope with the increasing \ndemand because of weak municipal financial and institutional capacities. While tariffs for basic \nurban services are low, the public-good nature of urban infrastructure makes a significant \nportion of urban basic services unsuited to having user fees.7 The perceived high and real risks \nof  urban  infrastructure  investments  make  private  investors  wary.  Recognizing  the  binding \nconstraints on scaling up urban infrastructure, the Government of India launched a reform-linked \nurban investment program in December 2005, the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal \nMission (JNNURM), to address some of the challenges emerging from rapid urbanization.8  \n \n4.  The summary sector assessment (footnote 7) gives a background to the generic and \nspecific issues facing urban infrastructure development in India\u2019s NCR. Among other things, \nthere is a need for a paradigm shift in the way urban infrastructure is planned and executed. \nFrom  being  city-centric,  urban  infrastructure  needs  to  have  a  regional  approach  that \nencompasses both surrounding rural areas as well as other smaller towns. City-centric urban \n                                                 \n1  The National Capital Region Planning Board (NCRPB) is an autonomous body under the Ministry of Urban \nDevelopment of the Government of India. NCRPB is not regulated by the Reserve Bank of India guidelines for a \nnonbanking financial company. By mandate, NCRPB is a planner and facilitates the financing of the investments \nidentified in the regional plan. http://www.ncrpb.nic.in/  \n2  Project preparatory technical assistance was provided to develop the project proposal (ADB. 2008. Preparing the \nSupport to the National Capital Region Planning Board. Manila.) \n3  Country Economic Indicators (Appendix 2). \n4  Goldman Sachs. 2003. Dreaming with BRICs: The Path to 2050. Global Economics Paper No. 99. New York. \n5  According to the estimates published by the Registrar General of India, 67% of the total population growth in India \nuntil 2026 is expected to take place in the urban areas. It is estimated that by 2030 India will have 41% of its \npopulation living in  urban areas. Goldman Sachs. 2007. India\u2019s urbanization: Emerging Opportunities.

JNNURM. http://jnnurm.nic.in/ ", "2   \ninfrastructure  planning  tends  to  be  a  reactive  approach,  responding  to  in-migration  and \ninfrastructure crises in a knee-jerk manner. A regional planning approach is more proactive, \nenabling systematic and inclusive urbanization, and sustainable economic growth.9 A regional \napproach has the potential to guide planned development of urban areas which are free of the \nnegative aspects of recently witnessed rapid urbanization\u2014environmental degradation, traffic \njams,  burgeoning  slums,  non-inclusive  growth,  and  increased  greenhouse  gas  emissions. \nMoreover,  given  the  weak  return  on  investment  that  has  long  payback  period,  urban \ninfrastructure financing needs debt with competitive interest rates and longer tenures to make \nurban  infrastructure  projects  bankable.  This  will  generate  interest  among  sponsors \n(subborrowers) and result in debt-based project financing, as against the largely grant-driven \nurban infrastructure culture that currently exists. \n \n5.  NCRPB is a regional planner and financier of the NCR, which is one of the fastest-\ngrowing urban agglomerate regions in India. NCRPB's Regional Plan 2021 envisages massive \nscaling up of urban infrastructure investments in the NCR. However, due to domestic debt \nmarket limitations, the tenure that NCRPB is able to currently offer is a maximum of 10 years. In \naddition, due to weak project development and project management capacities in a number of \nNCRPB's subborrowers, inadequate numbers of urban infrastructure projects are generated, \nand there are systemic weaknesses in project execution. Before weak urban infrastructure \nbecomes a binding constraint on the rapid pace of economic growth in the NCR, NCRPB needs \nto enable the scaling up of urban infrastructure by implementing the priorities of Regional Plan \n2021. NCRPB can accelerate the scaling-up process of urban development by (i) providing \nlonger-tenure low-cost debt; (ii) providing implementation support for subborrowers (borrowers \nof NCRPB) in urban planning, project development, and project implementation; (iii) identifying \nand supporting structuring of bankable projects and enabling private sector investments; and \n(iv) improving urban basic service provision by, among other things, encouraging partnership \nwith the private sector. Adequate incentives need to be provided by NCRPB to motivate cities \nand state government entities to undertake public health and environmental urban infrastructure \nprojects  that  can  mitigate  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  ensure  geographic  and  sector \ninclusiveness, and introduce private sector efficiencies. The remaining details of the rationale \nare discussed further in this section as well as in the summary sector assessment and Schedule \n1 of the framework financing agreement.10 \n \n6.  National Capital Region and counter magnet areas. The NCR is a 33,578 square \nkilometer area covering Delhi and subregions of the states of Haryana, Rajasthan, and Uttar \nPradesh. In addition to Delhi the NCR consists of nine districts of Haryana (Faridabad, Gurgaon, \nJhajjar, Mewat, Palwal, Panipat, Rewari, Rohtak and Sonipat), one district of Rajasthan (Alwar \ndistrict), and five districts of Uttar Pradesh (Baghpat, Bulandshahr, Gautam Buddha Nagar, \nGhaziabad and Meerut). The population of the NCR is 37 million (urbanization level of 54% as \nper the 2001 census), and this is expected to increase to 64 million by 2021. In addition to the \nNCR,  NCRPB  supports  Gwalior  (Madhya  Pradesh),  Patiala  (Punjab),  Ambala  and  Hissar \n(Haryana), Dehradun (Uttarakhand), Kota (Rajasthan), and Kanpur and Bareilly (Uttar Pradesh) \ncities  as  part  of  the  counter  magnet  areas  (CMAs)  where  development  strategies  are \nimplemented to ease the projected population pressure on the National Capital Territory of \nDelhi.  \n \n                                                 \n9 ADB. 2010.

Manila. \n10  Framework Financing Agreement and Periodic Financing Request for Project 1 (Appendix 2). \n ", "  3\n7.  Rapid economic growth in the NCR is likely to generate increased demand for drinking \nwater, waste water management, and solid-waste management in the order of Rs230 billion, \nwhich excludes the demand for urban transport infrastructure in the NCR. While the National \nCapital  Territory  of  Delhi  is  making  rapid  progress  in  developing  urban  infrastructure,  the \nremaining portions of the NCR, especially the subregion administered by the government of \nUttar  Pradesh,  are  still  lagging  in  infrastructure  resources.  Infrastructure  related  to  the \nenvironment and public health\u2014water supply, sewerage, and solid waste\u2014has been relatively \nneglected throughout the NCR in the past, and should be one of the key thrust areas. Analyses \nof  the  economies  of  states  and  cities  in  the  NCR  suggest  that  self-generated  funds  and \ntechnological  know-how  are  insufficient  to  provide  the  desired  rapid  growth  in  urban \ninfrastructure.  \n \n8.  The NCR's strength is that it continues to attract the largest share of foreign direct \ninvestment in India and efforts are under way to enhance this advantage by developing the \nDelhi\u2013Mumbai corridor, inclusive of high-speed rail connectivity. In this context, the supply of \nurban infrastructure needs planning and financing to ensure that the regional impacts of growth \nare maximized to foster competitiveness and environmental sustainability. Since most of these \ninfrastructure  demands  require  coordination,  a  regional  approach  is  needed  to  minimize \ngeographic and functional fragmentation. This is one of the primary motivations for creating \nNCRPB and is the basis of the proposed NCRPB business plan and the proposed National \nCapital Region Urban Infrastructure Financing Facility.  \n \n9.  National Capital Region Planning Board and the Regional Plan 2021. NCRPB came \ninto being by virtue of the NCRPB Act, 1985 passed by the Parliament and duly confirmed by \nthe legislatures of Haryana, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. As a financier, NCRPB\u2019s role is to \nfacilitate the financing of the investments in the NCR. In pursuance of this NCRPB has provided \nloans of Rs64.6 billion to 239 projects as of 30 October 2009.11 Over the years there has been a \nshift  in  NCRPB's  focus  in  terms  of  diversifying  sector  allocation  of  resources  towards \nenvironmental infrastructure and connectivity. NCRPB is committed to increasing investments in \nlagging areas of the NCR, and has set up a project development fund in 2009 to achieve this \nobjective as well as enhance access to capital markets by NCRPB and subborrowers.  \n \n10.  In  2005  NCRPB  notified  the  Regional  Plan  2021,  with  focus  on  core  sectors  of \ntransportation, power, water and sanitation, and solid waste, and an investment requirement of \nRs1,937.5 billion.12 Regional Plan 2021 aims to facilitate growth and balanced development of \nthe  NCR  by  providing  an  economic  base  in  the  identified  major  settlements  (metropolitan \ncenters and regional centers) to (i) absorb economic development impulses of Delhi, (ii) develop \nefficient transport networks, (iii) develop physical infrastructure, (iv) enable rational land use \npatterns, and (v) improve the environment and quality of life. As inputs into the regional plan, \nNCRPB progressed substantially in developing the transport sector plan (2009) and the water \nsupply plan (2009).13 The sector investment plans for sewerage and solid-waste management, \nincluding regional landfill sites, are under preparation. \n \n11.   While NCRPB has been financing investments, it is in the process of repositioning itself \nto achieve its scaled-up mandates. The basic vision of NCRPB is in terms of being a financier of \nrelevance and planner of significance. This entails (i) serving as a planner of relevance for \n                                                 \n11  National Capital Region Planning Board (Appendix 2).  \n12 Government of India, Ministry of Urban Development, National Capital Region Planning Board. Regional Plan \n2021: National Capital Region. Delhi. http://ncrpb.nic.in/docs/RP-2021.pdf   \n13  The functional plans for water resources and urban transport define the long-term development needs, and the \ninvestment needs are placed at Rs8 billion for water resources and Rs1,750 billion for urban transport. \n ", "4   \nentities  that  operate  at  a  regional  level  and  as  a  financier  of  relevance  for  local  bodies; \n(ii) moving away from  unlimited liability, administered credit pricing, and low leverage; and \n(iii) filling an institutional vacuum pertaining to urban infrastructure planning and development to \naddress the unique challenges in scaling up urban infrastructure investments in the NCR and \nCMAs (schedule 1 of the framework financing agreement [footnote 10] and the summary sector \nassessment [footnote 7]). NCRPB needs to address the institutional aspects of its role to \nfacilitate  infrastructure  financing  and  mitigate  specific  challenges  pertaining  to  urban \ninfrastructure development in the NCR. Moreover, it is difficult for public institutions such as \nlocal municipalities and other urban local bodies alone to meet the demand for urban facilities. \nThus, the need for successful public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) is indisputable if the regional \nplan  is  to  materialize  by  2021.  The  role  of  development  partners  in  urban  infrastructure \ndevelopment is limited in the NCR outside the National Capital Territory of Delhi. The Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) will be the first development partner to support NCRPB. 14 ADB has \nprovided technical assistance in the past few years to strengthen the capacities of NCRPB and \nits subborrowers.15 \n \n12.  To  summarize,  the  facility  is  built  on  strong  rationale  that  includes  (i)  transforming \nNCRPB to more effectively meet the scaled-up mandates in line with the priorities of Regional \nPlan 2021; (ii) strengthening the ability of subborrowers to design and execute high-quality \ninfrastructure; (iii) enabling private sector participation and PPPs in urban infrastructure and \nbasic service provision; (iv) introducing best practices in infrastructure planning, execution, and \noperations;  and  (v)  enabling  geographic  and  sector  inclusiveness,  and  directing  more \ninvestments  into  public  health  and  environmental  urban  infrastructure.  Beyond  the  NCR, \nadditional  development  benefits  are  expected  from  NCRPB's  successful  transformation \n(building on current strengths of NCRPB's unique regional planning and financing role) and \nstrengthened capacities from the facility for proactive project development, structuring private \nsector participation (PSP) and PPPs, and project execution. It will emerge as an institutional \nmodel for emulation by other urban sector entities. The proposed facility incorporates lessons \nlearnt (footnote 6), and is very much in line with ADB's Strategy 2020 as reflected in the India \ncountry partnership strategy for 2009\u2013201216 as well as India's 11th Five Year Plan.17 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact of the facility is to improve the quality of life and economic well-being of \nurban residents in India's NCR and CMAs. The outcome of the facility is that urban residents in \nthe intervention cities of the NCR and CMAs use improved growth-supporting and public health \nand environmental urban infrastructure services in accordance with the priorities of Regional \nPlan 2021. To this effect, the facility will support NCRPB in (i) leveraging its resources through a \nline of credit and other market access support services, and (ii) implementation support that will \n                                                 \n14  Development Coordination (Appendix 2). \n15  ADB  has  been  supporting  NCRPB  through  capacity  building  technical  assistance  (ADB.  2007.  Capacity \nDevelopment of the National Capital Region Planning Board. Manila.) between 2008 and 2010 to build NCRPB and \nsubborrowers\u2019 capacities in a number of areas that include (i) strengthening financial managements systems of \nNCRPB, (ii) improving risk management and treasury management, (iii) strengthening information technology to \nenhance efficiency of various functions of NCRPB, (iv) developing a business plan that lead to approval of a project \ndevelopment facility, (v) improving project development and implementation capacities, (vi) building capacities for \npublic\u2013private partnership and private sector participation, and (vii) developing web-based tools for building \ncapacities of subborrowers in developing high-quality urban infrastructure. \n16 ADB. 2008.

Outputs \n14.  There are three broad outputs of this facility: (i) creating high-quality urban public health \nand environmental infrastructure including water supply, sanitation, and waste management \nprojects; (ii) creating high-quality regional and urban infrastructure that will support economic \ngrowth and include investments in regional connectivity and multimodal public transit systems, \namong other things; and (iii) providing implementation support for strengthening NCRPB and \nparticipating subborrowers' capacity to scale up urban infrastructure and improve basic urban \nservices. The implementation support has the following subcomponents: (i) improving NCRPB's \neffectiveness to execute scaled-up infrastructure mandates; (ii) enabling inclusive and balanced \ngeographic  and  sector  infrastructure;  (iii)  ensuring  infrastructure  projects  are  executed \neffectively; and (iv) enabling PSP in urban infrastructure development and urban basic service \nprovision.18 \n \nD.

Framework financing agreement. NCRPB and the government have entered into a \nframework financing agreement with ADB (footnote 10). The agreement has recorded the full \nset of assurances, warranties, and representations on crosscutting themes covering safeguards, \ngovernance, anticorruption, financial management, procurement, disbursement, and subproject \nselection.  Before  ADB  accepts  the  PFR,  NCRPB  and  the  government  will  ensure  full \ncompliance with the terms and conditions of the agreement.  \n \n18.  Periodic financing request. Multipurpose subloans will be extended under the MFF to \na  range  of  subprojects  subject  to  submission  of  the  related  PFR  by  NCRPB  and  the \ngovernment, and execution of related loan agreements. Each PFR will be accompanied by a list \nof  subprojects  identified  for  financing  under  the  MFF,  including  subprojects  that  can  be \nsubstituted for subprojects not in compliance with ADB requirements. Each individual tranche \nwill  be  for  not  less  than  $70  million.  The  first  tranche  will  be  for  $78  million  to  finance \ninfrastructure subprojects ($75 million) and implementation support ($3 million). The indicative \nlist of subprojects, which have been submitted to ADB for consideration, are attached to the first \ntranche application (footnote 10).20 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe facility administration manual.21 NCRPB will be the executing agency. The existing Project \nSanctioning and Monitoring Group of NCRPB will continue to be the focal point for subproject \nappraisal, approval, and overall guidance.

NCRPB acknowledges that any approval of advance \ncontracting and/or retroactive financing will not constitute a commitment by ADB \nto finance the related facility. \nDisbursement  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed upon between NCRPB and ADB.    \nADB = Asian Development Bank, NCRPB = National Capital Region Planning Board. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and National Capital Region Planning Board. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n20.  The indicative subprojects identified as part of the pipeline and those that would be \nfinanced are based on accepted national and international design standards, and the designs \nincorporate  least-cost  technical  options,  especially  water  supply  and  sewerage.  The  major \ncodes are the Central Public Health Environmental Engineering Organization\u2019s code for water \n                                                 \n22 Financial Intermediary: Environmental and Social Management System Arrangement (Appendix 2). \n ", "8   \nand sanitation, the Municipal Solid Waste Management Handling Rules 2000 for municipal solid \nwaste, the Bureau of Indian Standards for structures, and the Indian Roads Congress codes for \ntransport infrastructure. The pipeline of subprojects consists of public health and environmental \nservices  (water,  waste  water,  and  growth-related  facilities),  transit  facilities  and  road \ninfrastructure, and information-technology-enabled facilities as part of the transit facilities. The \ntechnologies are those that are tested and are in operation in the country.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n21.  The estimated economic internal rates of return of seven indicative subprojects to be \nfinanced by the facility\u2014two multimodal transit centers (Anand Vihar and Sarai Kale Khan in \nDelhi), three roads projects (Badli bypass and Sonepat and Jhajjar roads in Haryana), and \nwater supply and sewerage projects (in Pataudi town in Haryana)\u2014range from 12.7% to 64.8%, \nindicating sufficiently high economic return compared with the opportunity cost of capital.23 The \nfinancial internal rate of return for the multimodal transit centers in Anand Vihar and Sarai Kale \nKhan ranges from 10.1% to 11.6%, and for the water supply subproject in Pataudi it is 6.3%. \nThe financial internal rates of return for all subprojects compare favorably to the weighted \naverage cost of capital.24 As roads are not revenue-generating, the analysis focused on the \ncapacity  of  the  investment  program  of  the  subborrower,  the  Public  Works  Department  of \nHaryana. Sensitivity analysis shows that the economic and financial internal rates of return are \ngenerally robust and relatively sensitive to changes in revenues. \n \nC.  Governance \n22.  The financial management and governance assessment reveals that there are no major \nissues with the accounting policies and procedures followed by NCRPB.25 NCRPB prepares \naccounts using accrual-based double-entry accounting as per the accepted Indian accounting \nstandards, which are generally compatible with international accounting standards. NCRPB \nfollows the Government of India's General Finance Rules (2005) and accounts are prepared in \nthe formats specified by the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office. Strengthening of financial \nmanagement  system  of  NCRPB  has  been  undertaken  with  the  support  of  ADB  technical \nassistance (footnote 15). Moreover, NCRPB has agreed to (i) undertake additional steps to \nachieve prudential norms of a financial intermediary; (ii) hire additional staff, among others, to \nstrengthen project implementation (including financial management and procurement); and (iii) \nstrengthen  project  approval  and  implementation  process  (footnote  10).  An  assessment  of \nprocurement capacity and procedures of NCRPB and selected subborrowers reveal that ADB's \nkey procurement principles of economy and efficiency, fairness, and transparency are adhered \nto. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith NCRPB. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in \nthe facility administration manual (footnote 21). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n23.  The facility reduces infrastructure and funding constraints, which will lead to faster and \nmore  inclusive  growth.  Some  sectors  directly  contribute  to  the  achievement  of  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, particularly water supply and sanitation. However, the facility contribution \nto poverty reduction is largely indirect. Long-term infrastructure development contributes to \n                                                 \n23  Economic Analysis (Appendix 2). \n24  Financial Analysis (Appendix 2). \n25  Financial Management and Governance Assessment (Appendix 2). \n ", "  9\neconomic growth which can have poverty reduction impacts, particularly in urban areas where \nmost of the facility's subprojects will be undertaken. A subproject selection criterion allows the \nfinancing of subprojects which directly address urban poverty issues, including provision of \nwater in unserved areas and slum improvement, among other things. The facility also provides \nassistance  to  Uttar  Pradesh  in  subproject  development.  Uttar  Pradesh,  with  lower  project \ndevelopment capacities, is also one of the states with higher poverty incidence, and so the \nfacility's  subprojects  will  have  higher  benefits  to  the  poor.  Because  women  benefit  from \nsubprojects and because they are disadvantaged by lower levels of education and literacy, the \ngender action plan ensures that (i) subproject details are disclosed to female beneficiaries, \n(ii) concerns of women are recorded and the design includes mitigation, (iii) subproject benefits \npositively impact women and benefits are equitable, and (iv) women are employed in subproject \nconstruction.26 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n24.  The facility is classified under category FI for environment, involuntary resettlement, and \nindigenous peoples. Due diligence and review show that there are no anticipated significant \nadverse environmental impacts. Limited negative impacts during construction can readily be \nmitigated.  There  are  significant  positive  environmental  and  public  health  benefits  from \nsubprojects. A subproject selection criterion ensures that involuntary resettlement impacts will \nbe avoided or minimized; hence, anticipated impacts are limited. No impacts on indigenous \npeoples are anticipated. Environmental impacts during design and construction stages are \nreadily addressed through mitigation measures. An ESMS is in place and an ESMS document \nhas been prepared, which clarifies NCRPB's environmental and social policies and operational \nguidelines,  safeguards  screening,  categorization,  review  procedures,  and  oversight  during \nsubproject  implementation.  The  ESMS  document  also  sets  out  a  plan  to  strengthen  the \nenvironmental and social organization structure and staffing, and performance monitoring and \nreporting procedures. The ESMS includes further development of institutional capacity within \nNCRPB  to  manage  environmental  and  social  issues.  The  ESMS  has  been  endorsed  by \nNCRPB.27 Disclosure of subproject safeguards documents are further described in the ESMS \n(footnote 22). \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigation Measures \n25.
