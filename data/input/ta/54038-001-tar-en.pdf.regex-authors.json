INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support research to evaluate \nthe economic and social welfare impacts of social assistance policies in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC), and propose reform directions and policy options. Through empirical and theoretical \nstudies  and  international  comparison,  the  TA  will  recommend  optimal  social  assistance \nexpenditure and benefit levels, and develop policy tools to improve the social assistance system. \nThe TA will produce knowledge products and build capacity among social protection policy \nmakers. The TA is included in the list of projects agreed between the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and the Government of the PRC on 22 January 2020.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Aligning social policy with an evolving socioeconomic context. Rapid economic \ngrowth and sustained anti-poverty efforts, including targeted social assistance, have significantly \nreduced extreme poverty in the PRC. However, even before the impact of the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) pandemic of 2020, economic growth in the PRC had moderated. After 4 decades of \nrapid economic development and a dramatic increase in people\u2019s living standards, gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) growth slowed from 6.7% in 2018 to 6.1% in 2019.2 Typically, social assistance \npolicies should build on a country\u2019s socioeconomic conditions and overall development goals. In \nthe context of higher living standards and the expected eradication of extreme poverty by the end \nof 2020, inequality remains an issue and the concept of relative poverty becomes more relevant.3 \nSocial assistance policies in the PRC require new strategic choices, and the future direction of \nthe reforms depends on a comprehensive understanding of the economic and social impacts of \nvarious social assistance policies. \n \n3.  Functions and features of the social assistance system. Key functions of the social \nassistance system include guaranteeing citizens\u2019 basic livelihoods, promoting social equity, and \nmaintaining social harmony and stability.4 The social assistance system includes a variety of \npolicy tools for the poor\u2014including cash transfers such as the dibao (minimum basic living \nguarantee); the tekun program for destitute people (formerly wubao); and special assistance for \neligible poor families for education, health care, housing, and employment. Temporary assistance \nis granted for disaster relief in emergencies. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the State \nCouncil issued new guidelines in August 2020 to refine the social assistance system, improve the \ntargeting and adjustment of benefit levels, and expand the coverage of welfare programs.5 A new \nsocial  assistance  law  is  in the  State  Council\u2019s  legislative  work  plan  for  2020.6 The  public \nconsultation version of the draft law was posted online for review in September 2020. Once \ncomments have been collected and addressed, the legislative body (the People\u2019s Congress) will \nconsider the draft law.  \n \n4.  Social assistance programs. Dibao is the foundation of the social assistance system, \nproviding unconditional cash transfers to urban and rural households with a per capita income \n \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 29 October 2020. \n2  ADB. 2020.

As of April 2019, dibao had 9.6 million urban beneficiaries (1.1% of \nthe  urban  population)  and  34.8  million  rural  beneficiaries  (6.2%  of  the  rural  population), \ncomprising 3.2% of the PRC\u2019s population.7 Over time, the standards have increased while the \nnumber of beneficiaries has declined. Nevertheless, dibao remains one of the largest social \ntransfer programs in the world. The tekun program for the destitute complements the family-based \ndibao system, and is targeted at specific vulnerable groups (the elderly, persons with disabilities, \nand children under 16) who have no work, no other source of income, and no other support\u2014also \nknown as \u201cthe three nos.\u201d As of April 2019, tekun covered about 4.50 million rural and 0.28 million \nurban  beneficiaries  (footnote  7).  Special  interim  assistance  for  low-income  families  covers \neducation, medical care, housing, and employment.  \n \n5.  Competing views of social assistance expenditure. The PRC\u2019s comprehensive social \nassistance system covers various hardships and risks faced by the poor, but social assistance \nexpenditure remains relatively low as a share of GDP (less than 1%) when compared to the \naverage for emerging markets in Asia, all emerging markets, and the average across members \nof the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.8 Competing schools of thought \nconsider social assistance on the one hand as a required fiscal expenditure or a financial burden \nto meet the basic needs of low-income people; and on the other hand as a positive social and \neconomic investment that plays a crucial role in reducing inequality, increasing consumption, \nstabilizing economic fluctuations, and promoting long-term sustainable economic development. \nThese contrasting perspectives correspond to different social assistance and social protection \npolicy development options and reform directions. \n \n6.  Determining expenditure levels. Social assistance programs generally require large \nfiscal expenditures. Lowering expenditure by reducing benefit levels could allow more public \ninvestment in other areas with potentially higher returns. Lower welfare benefits could also \nencourage  low-income  groups  to  provide  more  labor.  On  the  other  hand,  social  transfers \n(especially special assistance for medical care, education, and employment) can directly enable \nthe  poor  to  invest more  in  human  capital, thereby  increasing the  country\u2019s  human  capital \naccumulation and improving economic competitiveness. At the same time, since low-income \npeople have a higher marginal propensity to consume, transfer payments increase consumption \nand can stabilize domestic demand. These different aspects should be considered in determining \nthe  optimal  level  of  social  assistance.  Research  using the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-\noperation and Development\u2019s data sets suggests that different social expenditure schemes have \ndifferent effects on poverty, inequality, and growth.9 This means policy makers have the possibility \nto target more accurately when deciding on social assistance schemes, with the goal of reducing \npoverty and inequality without negatively affecting GDP growth. \n \n7.  Knowledge gaps. Few researchers have studied the impact of social assistance on \nbeneficiary welfare as well as inequality and economic development in the PRC. The impact \nchannels of special or interim assistance programs (medical care, education, housing, and \nemployment) on individuals and the economy may be different from the impact channels of direct \ncash transfers such as dibao. Comparing the PRC\u2019s social assistance programs with similar ones \nin developed countries, e.g., in France or the United States, could provide useful lessons and \n \n7  Government of the PRC, Ministry of Civil Affairs. 2019.

Strategic alignment and value addition. Strengthening social protection systems and \nservice delivery is fundamental to the ADB Strategy 2030 operational priority of addressing \nremaining poverty and reducing inequalities.11 By promoting gender balance among participants \nof capacity development activities, the TA also addresses the ADB operational priority of gender \nequality and women\u2019s empowerment. The TA is aligned with the five Sustainable Development \nGoals that explicitly mention social protection.12 The TA will build on the long history of ADB \ncooperation with the PRC on social protection and specifically social assistance. The TA program \nof the past decade has supported analytical work to inform the development of cash transfer \nprograms and the establishment of the urban poverty line; assessment of the impacts of the hukou \n(household registration) system on migrant workers and their families; assessment of social \nprotection financing, benefits, and targeting; development of social work services for vulnerable \ngroups (older persons and children); and contracting of social organizations for service delivery, \namong others. This TA builds on a 2020 TA completion report recommending further ADB support \nfor social assistance reforms.13  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: social assistance strengthened, basic living \nstandards guaranteed, social justice promoted, and social harmony and stability maintained \n(footnote 4). The TA will have the following outcome: evidence-based social assistance policy \ntoolbox improved.14 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output  1:  Analytical  knowledge  products  developed.  The  TA  will  analyze  the \nrelationship between social assistance and economic development, and propose a scientific \nmethod to determine the level and coverage of social assistance. It will analyze the economic and \nwelfare impacts of social assistance from the micro and macro perspective, including theoretical \nand empirical studies. The micro perspective includes the programs\u2019 impact on consumption, \ninequality, health, and education. TA experts will construct a macrostructural model that includes \nthe behaviors of individuals, enterprises, and governments to determine the optimal assistance \nlevels of social assistance programs from a general equilibrium perspective. A counterfactual \nanalysis will evaluate the impacts of several social assistance programs and assistance levels \nunder different economic development stages. This will help predict which level of assistance can \nmaximize both welfare and economic development. The TA will also undertake a literature review, \n \n10  The French subsistence allowance has expanded since its introduction in the late 1980s, causing enormous pressure \non finances. Proposed reforms have had varying degrees of success. The extensive social protection system of the \nUnited States includes highly targeted social assistance for poor families. The PRC\u2019s Ministry of Civil Affairs (MOCA) \nproposes exploring several aspects to inform reforms to the PRC system.  \n11 ADB. 2018.

Output 2: Social assistance policy makers\u2019 capacity built. Utilizing the data from \noutput 1, output 2 will include a series of seminars and workshops involving stakeholders across \ngovernment agencies working on social assistance. International and national experts may be \nengaged as resource persons on specific topics as needed. This output also includes the \nproduction of online learning materials, and an international study visit to an ADB member country \nor countries.15 An understanding of the TA findings, recommendations, and policy tools will \nsupport social assistance policies, planning, and implementation. MOCA policy makers will be \nable to propose the development direction and potential reforms of social assistance policies, \nsuggest optimal social assistance benefit levels, and recommend improvements to the design of \nsocial assistance in the PRC.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $330,000, of which $300,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items \nare  listed  in  Appendix  2.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of \ncounterpart staff, access to data as appropriate to the TA, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  The executing agency will be MOCA. The implementing agencies will be two MOCA \ndepartments: the Department of Social Assistance and the Center for the Identification and \nGuidance of Low-Income Families. ADB will administer the TA.
