INTRODUCTION \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will help the Ministry of Taxes (MOT) \nand the Ministry of Finance (MOF) of the Republic of Azerbaijan to strengthen tax revenue \nadministration and policy analysis capacity to mobilize domestic resources to lessen fiscal \ndependence on oil revenues. The TA will provide services and operational support to help both \nministries design tax administration and policy reforms. The proposed coverage areas are (i) \nhuman resource management, (ii) taxpayer compliance, and (iii) tax revenue analysis and \nmodeling. The TA will also provide support on capacity development plans. \n \n2.  The TA is consistent with Asian Development Bank (ADB) engagement in Azerbaijan, as \nreflected in the country partnership strategy, 2019\u20132023, and is aligned to Azerbaijan\u2019s Strategic \nRoadmap of National Economic Perspectives and the 2030 agenda for sustainable development.1 \nThe TA will directly contribute to ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational priority of strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity and ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy objective of the \neconomic diversification for Azerbaijan.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Recent tax revenue performance. Tax revenues in Azerbaijan as a percentage of gross \ndomestic product fell from 11.6% in 2016 to 9.9% in 2017 and 9.3% in 2018, below that of \ncomparative countries in Central and West Asia\u201419.8% for Kyrgyz Republic and 25.7% for \nGeorgia in 2017 and an average of 17.3% for Asia and the Pacific.3 The state budget depends \nhighly on transfers from the State Oil Fund of the Republic of Azerbaijan, which transferred \nAZN11.35 billion (58.2% of state budget revenues) to the state budget in 2013, and AZN6.10 \nbillion (36.9% of state budget revenues) in 2017.4 The state budget\u2019s reliance on oil revenues has \nmade the economy vulnerable to external shocks. Recognizing this problem, the government has \nfocused on strengthening tax policy and administration capacity in non-oil sectors and has \nimplemented several tax reforms, including introducing an advance tax ruling concept and the \nconcept of voluntary tax disclosure, modifying value-added tax (VAT) rules, and promoting \ncashless payments. \n \n4.  Changes in the operating environment. The rapid globalization and digitalization of \nfinancial services, investment, and trade has impacted the revenue base. The existence of a \nperceived large informal economy and the growth of e-commerce significantly undermine tax \ncollection. The government has demonstrated support and commitment to modernizing tax \nadministration and more formally recognizing taxpayers\u2019 rights and service expectations. In May \n2019, the first taxation ombudsman was appointed under the MOT. Further, the government \nrecently amended the tax law to encourage compliance and to support a better balance between \n \n1  ADB. 2019.

The Strategic Road Maps for the National Economy and Main Economic Sectors consists of strategy \ndocuments to set medium- and long-term goals for reforms and sustained development of the national economy and \n11 key sectors to promote non-oil economic growth. It was approved by the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, \nMr. Ilham Aliyev, on 6 December 2016. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is a set of international \ndevelopment goals from 2016 to 2030, which was adopted by the UN Sustainable Development Summit held in \nSeptember 2015 in New York. \n2  ADB. 2018.

The MOT developed and publicly \ncommunicated high-level reform priorities designed to better help taxpayers to comply, build \ntaxpayer and staff satisfaction, and strengthen revenue by dealing more effectively with areas of \nnon-compliance. Progress is already evident on a number of fronts, including steadily and \nconsistently  improving  indicators  for  the  ease  of  doing  business,  because  of  streamlined \nadministrative processes such as registration and payment.5 These reforms have been driven by \nthe MOT\u2019s strong commitment to critically review key functions and implement measures to \naddress identified weaknesses.  \n \n5.  Human resource and organizational performance management. For effective tax \nadministration,  the  authorities  need  to  strengthen  tax  officers\u2019  capacity.  Staff  training  and \neducation are central parts of effective tax administration, which can serve as a tool for attracting, \ndeveloping, and retaining talent, as well as for improving the effectiveness of administration. \nDespite past capacity building support from development partners, the MOT\u2019s tax administration \ncapacity  remains  weak,  in  large  part  because  it  lacks  a systematic and  organization-wide \ncompetency management system. Poor recruitment processes exacerbate this issue. Frequent \nturnover of key officials, driven in part by an inadequate human resources framework, undermines \nsustained efforts for better tax policy and administration. \n \n6.  Increasing the effectiveness of compliance risk management. Effectively managing \ncompliance risk involves (i) providing user-friendly support and services for taxpayers who want \nto comply and (ii) dealing more effectively with taxpayers who do not comply. Both are crucial. \nTaxpayers often cannot easily access or understand current services and communications. In \ndealing with non-compliance, the MOT does not often target the highest risks to revenue or firmly \naddress the most serious incidents on non-compliance. \n \n7.  Supporting voluntary compliance with better facilitation, education, and services. \nTaxpayers need support and advice to help them meet their tax obligations. To maximize \nvoluntary compliance, tax authority must provide taxpayers with information, assistance, and \nproducts that are easily accessible and readily understood. This will enable taxpayers to correctly \nfulfil their obligations more easily, thus minimizing the compliance costs of tax administration. The \nMOT has prioritized this area and is seeking to review and assess current practices to identify \nopportunities to strengthen taxpayer services and build taxpayer satisfaction, which is known to \nsupport improved voluntary compliance. \n \n8.  Effectively dealing with serious incidents of non-compliance. Business operations \nare becoming more complex as the Azerbaijan economy is increasingly internationalized. This \nhas brought innovations in business structures, new financial products, and increased use of more \ncomplex arrangements for tax planning. A complex tax system with a relatively high tax burden \ndrives tax avoidance and evasion, which in turn contribute to more aggressive tax planning. In \naddition, more citizens are being brought into the tax net, and emerging new business practices, \nincluding  an  expanding  e-commerce  sector,  have  heightened  complexity.  These  factors \ncontribute to the need for more effective compliance risk management. The tax authority should \nhave in place strategies and structures to closely monitor and manage non-compliance with tax \nlaw. The traditional approach, largely involving one-to-one interventions to obtain compliance and \ncollect  taxes,  remains  costly  and  ineffective.  The  President  of  the  Republic  of  Azerbaijan \napproved a resolution on tax reforms in August 2016 to enhance the risk management system, \nincrease scope of e-audit for large taxpayers, and improve regulations on all forms of tax \n \n5  World Bank. Doing Business 2019. Washington, D.C. https://www.doingbusiness.org/ \n \n ", "3 \ninspections,  among  other  things.6 Despite  these  actions,  non-compliance  with  tax  laws  is \nconsidered high and largely unchecked, and business processes for tax administration and tax \narrears management and collection are still inefficient. \n \n9.  Tax revenue modeling and policy analysis. In order to manage public finance prudently, \nrevenue forecasts are essential to assess budget planning and management processes and \nestimate the impact of tax expenditures on revenues. Revenue forecasts define the budget \nenvelope and form the basis for effective mid- to long-term planning, and transparency of the \nforecasting process is key to creating accountability in revenue collection. The multi-year budget \nshould be based on a sound revenue model and methodology that can provide a platform with \nrobust fiscal rubrics. The MOF needs to develop the capacity to evaluate, review, and analyze \nrevenue  forecasting  models;  to  estimate  tax  expenditure  through  microsimulation  model \nestimations; and to determine the welfare effects of tax expenditures. \n \n10.  Priority reform areas. The need to build a knowledge-based economy has set a new \nagenda for tax authorities, including: enhancing the regulatory role of tax policy; creating an \naffordable, transparent, and attractive tax environment; upgrading tax administration; improving \nservices  for  entrepreneurs;  and  establishing  modern  corporate  governance.  An  ADB-\nadministered TA currently covers some of these areas.7 These reforms also strengthen the policy \ncontent that falls under the coverage of subprogram 2 of the Improving Governance and Public \nSector Efficiency Program, scheduled for approval in 2019. 8 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact will be the non-oil fiscal position improved. The outcome will be tax policy and \ncompliance administration strengthened.9 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n12.  Output  1:  Human  resource  and  organizational  performance  management \nstrengthened. Drawing on ongoing work in tax administration and a comprehensive diagnostic \nstudy of tax administration conducted by an ADB-administered TA (footnote 7), the TA will support \nthe MOT by providing technical advice to (i) develop and implement a leadership development \nprogram to build a performance management culture and (ii) develop and implement a well-\ndesigned competency management system to strengthen staff recruitment and development. \nThis work will include (i) a leadership development program and staff consultations to identify and \nimplement ways to better manage performance and address staff concerns and (ii) a pilot study \nand recommendation in selected areas of tax administration (e.g. arrears collection, compliance \nrisk management, and tax appeals) to develop and implement a competency management \nframework. The TA will draw from international practices and solutions that could work in the \nAzerbaijan context to address issues or deficiencies in this reform area. \n \n \n6  The President of the Republic of Azerbaijan. 2016. \u201cDirections of Tax Reforms for 2016\u201d, Baku. \n7  ADB. 2019. \u201cStrengthening the Azerbaijan Tax Administration\u201d financed by the Domestic Resource Mobilization Trust \nFund administered by ADB with contribution from the Government of Japan.

Output 2: Taxpayer services improved. The TA will help the MOT by providing technical \nadvice to improve taxpayer voluntary compliance with improved taxpayer support through an \neffective stakeholder consultation program and user-centered design of taxpayer interactions and \nservices.  This  work  will  include  (i)  diagnostic  review  of  taxpayer  services,  including  tax \nadministration  information  systems,  identifying  digital  opportunities  to  improve  overall  tax \nadministration management; (ii) recommendations to improve taxpayer voluntary compliance with \nimproved taxpayer support and services, including user-centered design of taxpayer interactions \nand services; and (iii) improving an ongoing stakeholder consultation program.  \n \n14.  Output 3: Taxpayer compliance improved by dealing more effectively with serious \nincidents of non-compliance. The TA will support the MOT by providing technical advice to \nimprove compliance by dealing more effectively with serious incidents of non-compliance such \nas: (i) reducing the negative impact and improving control of the hidden or shadow economy; (ii) \nbuilding industry-based knowledge and audit capability; and (iii) arresting the growth of arrears \nand building a payment culture. This work will include (i) a research study on the shadow economy; \n(ii) recommendations on ways to control the shadow economy; (iii) trainings for various audit \ntechniques, including indirect methods and industry-specific tax audit and risk-based approaches \nto tax collection; and (iv) conducting study tours on VAT incentive schemes such as partial refunds \nand lotteries, and use of fiscal tools. \n \n15.  Output 4: Fiscal management enhanced through improved fiscal modeling. The TA \nwill help the MOF to: (i) revise revenue forecasting models for each type of taxation; (ii) develop \nthe 2020\u20132030 fiscal model, which projects financial performance and the financial position of the \ngovernment over a medium-term horizon; (iii) develop models to estimate tax expenditure through \nmicrosimulation model estimations; (iv) develop models to determine the welfare (economic) \neffects of tax expenditures; and (v) conduct training on tax policy analysis with the aim of \nenhancing the capacity of MOF officials, including female officials. \n \n16.  The TA will support the engagement of international and national experts in tax policy and \nadministration.  The  TA  has  coordinated  and  builds  upon  engagement  provided  by  other \ndevelopment  partners.  The  European  Union  welcomed  ADB  initiatives  to  support  tax \nadministration, including e-audit and human resource management, and agreed to seek further \ncoordination,  including  international  taxation  and  aligning  transfer  pricing  legislation  with \ninternational  standards.  The  World  Bank  is  conducting  a  capacity  development  needs \nassessment by using its tax administration diagnostic tool. The Centre for Tax Policy and \nAdministration of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the \nGlobal Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes have expressed \ntheir support to capacity development activities. The OECD KOREA Policy Centre agreed to \nprovide support and collaborate on capacity development activities. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $600,000, of which (i) $100,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources) and (ii) $500,000 will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund  \nadministered by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. The Republic of Korea \ne-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund will finance operational expenses and will not be used \nfor (i) civil works, (ii) procurement of large-scale equipment, (iii) permanent staffing costs, or (iv) \nthe hiring of staff consultants. The MOT will provide counterpart support in the form of staff time, \noffice space, office supplies, secretarial assistance, domestic transportation, and other in-kind \ncontributions.  \n ", "5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  ADB will administer the TA through its Central and West Asia Department\u2019s Public \nManagement, Financial Sector, and Trade Division, which will select, supervise, and evaluate \nconsultants; organize discussions; and provide staff to act as resource persons as required. \nADB\u2019s Azerbaijan Resident Mission will assign staff to join the TA implementation team.
