Justification \n1.  The  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  comprising  of  two  specialized \nteams of experts is needed to define the scope and to conduct required due diligence of the \nproject. The objectives of the technical assistance are to (i) design a project suitable for Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) financing by identifying the most appropriate project components and \nfinancial modalities to achieve the desired project impact; (ii) design the project to attract private \nsector  participation  and  leverage  effectiveness  of  the  project;  (iii)  review  proposed  project \ncomponents based on detailed due diligence assessment of technical, economic and financial, \ngovernance, safeguards, poverty and social, and project risks; (iv) provide trainings to the \nexecuting and implementing agencies and other relevant stakeholders to increase institutional \ncapacity on project development and implementation procedures; and (v) formulate measures to \nensure  long\u2013term  sustainability  of  project  facilities  by  improving  the  management  and \ngovernance capacity of executing and implementing agencies. \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n2.  The PPTA will be implemented in two phases. A team of individual experts will conduct \nthe first phase to work on the project design including appropriate schemes for public-private \npartnership (PPP). The project design team will include technical experts on municipal solid \nwaste management, landfill management and leachate treatment, and soil pollution control and \nbrownfield development, and PPP. The team will assist the government and ADB identify \nappropriate technologies, approaches, and financial plans. Based on the technical design, the \nteam will also identify the most appropriate project financial structure, modality, and institutional \narrangement  for  private  sector  participation.  The  scope  of  analysis  includes  feasibility \nassessments to attract private sector financing to cover a part of the project scope to leverage \nADB and government domestic counterpart funds, and identify ADB financial modalities suitable \nfor the project design. Based on the team\u2019s outputs, composition of experts and terms of \nreference for the second phase consultant team will be determined. \n \n3.  A  consulting  firm  will  implement  the  second  phase  to  conduct  due  diligence \nassessments on financial, economic, environment, land acquisition and resettlement, social and \ngender development, governance, public finance, and procurement. The project due diligence \nteam will deliver capacity building trainings on project design and project performance and \nmonitoring system, ADB\u2019s safeguards policy, and ADB\u2019s disbursement and procurement policies \nand guidelines. The major outputs and activities of the PPTA are summarized in Table A3.1. \n \nTable A3.1: Summary of Major Outputs and Activities \nExpected \nExpected  Completion \nMajor Activities  Completion Date  Major Outputs  Date \nProject design team \nPPP assessment  30 Oct 2015  Inception report  31 Aug 2015 \nTechnical assessment  30 Oct 2015  Project technical design report  31 Dec 2015 \nProject due diligence team \nADB\u2019s safeguards policy training  31 Dec 2016  Draft project safeguards documents, FMA,   30 Jun 2016 \nADB\u2019s disbursement and    GAP, PCA, and SDAP   \nprocurement training  31 Dec 2016  Final report  31 Dec 2016 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, FMA = financial management assessment, GAP = gender action plan, PCA = \nprocurement capacity assessment, PPP = public-private partnership, SDAP = social development action plan.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank.
