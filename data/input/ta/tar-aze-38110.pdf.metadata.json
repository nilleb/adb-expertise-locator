In February 2004, the Government of Azerbaijan requested technical assistance (TA) to \ndevelop a collateral framework and microfinance regulations. During the Asian Development \nBank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Fact-Finding and Appraisal missions for the proposed Micro and Rural Finance \nProject, an understanding was reached with the Government on the TA\u2019s objective, scope, and \nimplementation arrangements.1 The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n  \n2.  Azerbaijan\u2019s financial sector is at an early stage of development. With 43 commercial \nbanks  and  combined  assets  of  $1  billion\u2014equivalent  to  14.5%  of  gross  domestic  product \n(GDP)\u2014the banking system dominates the financial sector. Despite the decline in their market \nshare, the two state-owned commercial banks, the International Bank of Azerbaijan and the \nUnited Universal Bank, account for 57% of total assets, 47% of total loans, and 69% of deposits. \nThe financial sector also includes a number of nonbank credit organizations, AgrarKredit,2 11 \nmicrofinance  institutions  (MFIs),  3  business  lenders,  28  credit  unions,  30  pawnshops,  27 \ninsurance  companies,  and  3  leasing  companies.  The  securities  market  consists  largely  of \ngovernment securities. The volume of outstanding Treasury bills has decreased rapidly in recent \nyears and currently amounts to $28 million. Stock market capitalization is only 0.1% of GDP and \ntrading activity is virtually nonexistent.  \n \n3.  The combination of liberal entry requirements and lax prudential regulation led to the \ncollapse of a large number of banks during the first half of the 1990s. As a result, many people \nlost their life savings. The spillover effect of the Russian and Turkish banking crises in 1998 and \n2001,  respectively,  further  weakened  the  banking  system.  Despite  recent  increases,  bank \ndeposits are equivalent to only 8% of GDP and credit outstanding amounts to 10% of GDP. \nBank  borrowing  and  lending  are  mostly  short  term,  with  few  deposits  and  loans  having \nmaturities greater than 1 year. Interest rates have remained high despite falling inflation. \n \n4.  Since the late 1990s, the Government has undertaken a number of measures to stabilize \nand  strengthen  the  banking  system.  The  regulatory  and  supervisory  framework  has  been \nstrengthened considerably. Nonperforming loans peaked at 62.0% of outstanding loans in 1999, \nbut had been reduced to 8% by early 2004. The International Bank of Azerbaijan and the United \nUniversal Bank have undergone significant restructuring in preparation for privatization. To \npromote consolidation, the National Bank of Azerbaijan (NBA) has recently raised the minimum \ncapital requirement for banks from $2.5 million to $3.5 million effective January 2005, and to $5 \nmillion effective January 2006.  \n \n5.  However,  the  impact  of  these  and  future  reforms  in  terms  of  improving  financial \nintermediation will be limited unless the fundamental weaknesses in the collateral framework \nare addressed.  Key weaknesses are the inconsistencies in the provisions of the Civil Code and \nthe Pledge Law.3 For example, the Pledge Law requires all pledges where the lender does not \ntake  physical  possession  to  be  registered,  whereas  the  Civil  Code  only  requires  this  for \nmortgages. Discrepancies are also apparent in the level of description required for pledged \nproperty. The Civil Code refers to a movable property register, but no such register exists. The \n                                                \n1   The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet Edition) on June 1, 2004. \n2   AgrarKredit is a state-owned institution specializing in rural finance. It has a limited license for lending services and \nacts as an implementing agency for a number of projects financed by donor agencies. \n3  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, 2002. Analysis of the Current Secured Transactions Legal \nRegime in Azerbaijan, Secured Transactions Project. \n ", "2   \n \n \n \nabsence of a centralized collateral registry for either movable or immovable property reduces \ntransparency and increases transaction costs. Debt enforcement is weak, in part because of \nlegal inconsistencies and in part due to the lack of well-trained judges. An additional impediment \nis  the  lack  of  public  awareness  about  collateral  matters.  Combined,  these  weaknesses \nsignificantly increase the cost of credit.  \n \n6.  The 2004 Law on Mortgage Registration was drafted with support from the European \nBank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development.  The  law  makes  general  provisions  for  state \nregistration  of  immovable  property  and  of  collateral  origination,  transfer,  and  invalidation. \nHowever, further assistance is required for the implementation of the law. This will entail drafting \nimplementing  regulations  and  procedures,  establishing  a  collateral  registry,  and  providing \nrelated  training.  The  Government  has  requested  ADB  assistance  for  strengthening  debt \nenforcement and for the establishment an effective collateral registration system. \n  \n7.  The 11 MFIs in operation in Azerbaijan have a total of 34 branches covering 42 of the \ncountry\u2019s  66  rural  districts.  They  provide  loans  for  small  and  microenterprises,  farming, \nlivestock, agribusiness, trading, and services in amounts ranging from $100 to $10,000. As of \nSeptember 2004, the 11 MFIs had 39,897 active borrowers and a total outstanding loan portfolio \nof $13.9 million. Portfolio at risk over 30 days is low at about 1% of outstanding loans. Of the 11 \nMFIs, 6 have incomes that exceed operating costs. However coverage is still extremely low and \nmicrofinance reaches only 5.9% of an estimated 670,000 rural households. \n \n8.  A key impediment to the development of MFIs in Azerbaijan is the absence of an \neffective legal and regulatory framework. MFIs are currently governed by the Law on Banks and \nBanking Activity, which requires them to register with the Ministry of Justice as limited liability \ncompanies,  and  to  be  licensed  by  NBA.  The  registration  and  licensing  processes  are \ncumbersome and costly. The licensing regulation prohibits MFIs from collecting any form of \nsavings and from borrowing from other local sources, making them fully dependent on donor \nfunds.  In addition, the regulatory oversight of MFIs is weak. The quarterly reports submitted by \nMFIs to NBA are used mostly for statistical purposes and to ensure that MFIs do not mobilize \nsavings.  \n \n9.  At the Government\u2019s request, ADB has helped prepare a draft Law on Microfinance.4 \nThe draft law makes a number of recommendations, including allowing MFIs to mobilize savings \nand simplifying registration and licensing procedures. The draft law is under review by NBA, and \nis expected to be submitted to Parliament in mid-2005. The next important step is to improve the \nregulatory  and  supervisory  framework.  This  will  entail  drafting  implementing  regulations, \nestablishing reporting requirements, and training NBA staff for effective on-site and off-site \nsupervision of MFIs. \n \n10.  A number of donors have contributed to the development of MFIs in Azerbaijan. The \nUnited  States  Agency  for  International  Development  and  a  number  of  nongovernmental \norganizations, including Adventist Development and Relief Agency Credit, World Vision, the \nFoundation for International Community Assistance, and Agricultural Cooperative Development \nInternational and Volunteers in Overseas Cooperative Assistance, have provided lines of credit \nto their partner MFIs in Azerbaijan, along with grant assistance for capacity building. However, \nassistance to develop the regulatory and supervisory framework has not yet been provided.  \n \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2003.

The goal of the advisory TA is to promote the development and outreach of commercial \nbanks and MFIs in Azerbaijan. The objectives are to: (i) create an effective collateral and debt \nenforcement framework, and (ii) improve the regulatory and supervisory framework for MFIs. \nOutputs will include: (i) an improved legal structure for collateral and debt enforcement, (ii) a \ncentralized collateral registry framework, (iii) an increase in public awareness about collateral \nissues, (iv) MFI regulations that are in line with international best practice, and (v) a framework \nfor effective supervision and compliance with MFI regulations. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n1.  Create an Effective Collateral and Debt Enforcement Framework \n \n12.  This will entail the following activities: \n(i)   Review the existing legal structure for collateral and debt enforcement, identify \nweaknesses and inconsistencies, and recommend amendments, \n(ii)  Develop  detailed  recommendations  for  establishing  and  operationalizing  a \ncentralized public registry for fixed and movable collateral, \n(iii)  Draft operating procedures and manuals for the collateral registry, \n(iv)  Develop and conduct a training program for judges on effective enforcement of \ncollateral rules, and \n(v)  Conduct a public awareness program on collateral issues. \n \n2.  Improve the Regulatory and Supervisory Framework for MFIs \n \n13.  This will entail the following activities: \n(i)  Develop detailed implementing regulations for the new Law on Microfinance, \n(ii)  Develop on-site and off-site supervision processes for MFIs, \n(iii)  Draft internal manuals for NBA, and compliance guidelines for MFIs, \n(iv)  Design and conduct training on new regulations and on supervision for MFIs and \nthe NBA, and \n(v)  Complete  a  round  of  quarterly  reports  and  analysis  to  ensure  timely  and \ncomplete reporting. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.0 million equivalent, of which $697,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $303,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. The Government has \nrequested  ADB  to  finance  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  of  $697,000  and  $103,000 \nequivalent of the local currency cost for a total of $800,000. The TA will be financed by ADB on \na grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government \nwill finance the balance of the local currency cost of $200,000 equivalent by providing office \nspace and logistical support, workshop facilities, and counterpart staff. Detailed cost estimates \nare in Appendix 2.  \n \n \n ", "4   \n \n \n \n \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.
