The  Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous  Region  (XUAR)  Government  and  Tacheng  Municipal \nGovernment (TMG), in consultation with the Asian Development Bank (ADB), have identified the \nproject components under the proposed ensuing loan. It is a multisector and technically complex \nproject, requiring full-scale due diligence in technical, economic, financial, social, resettlement, \nenvironmental, and institutional aspects through a project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA). \nThe  PPTA  will  develop  the  project  suitable for  ADB funding,  in  conjunction  with  the  country \npartnership strategy, sector and operational experience, international best practices, and lessons \nlearned from previous projects. \n \nB.

Phase  1  will  be  implemented  while  the  selection  of  consulting \nservices of Phase 2 is underway. \n \n3.  Phase  1.  A  team  of  individually  recruited  consultants  will  conduct  the  following  data \ngathering and preliminary assessment: (i) review project components feasibility study report (FSR) \nfor consistency with the development program; (ii) check the design criteria for each component \naccords with national standards; (iii) review background and justification for technical proposals \n(namely:  flood  risk  standard,  road  standard  category  per  location,  capacity  and  treatment \nrequirements of wastewater treatment plant, water availability assessment for  Baktu Liaota New \nArea and E\u2019min county); (iv) collate data for digital modeling of water supply and sewerage at \nBaktu  Liaota  New  Area;  and  (v)  conduct  training  (namely  on  ADB\u2019s  project  processing  and \nimplementation requirements) and stakeholder workshops in each component city/county. These \nconsultants will be engaged for about 3.5 person-months (1.5 person-months international and 2 \nperson-months national) on an intermittent basis.  \n \n4.  The Phase 1 consultants will prepare a draft final report and a final report to include (i) \noverview of consistency of proposals with respect to national and regional standards, Twelfth Five-\nYear Plan, regional and local master plans and other adopted development plans; (ii) detailed \ntechnical  assessment  of  FSR  proposals  and  identification  of  technical  options  with \nrecommendations for change as necessary; and (iii) specification and supporting input data for \ndigital modeling. \n \n5.  Phase 2. Building on the work from the Phase 1, a PPTA consulting firm will prepare a \ncomprehensive project feasibility study for an investment project for ADB loan financing.
