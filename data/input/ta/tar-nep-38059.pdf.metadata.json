The Government of Nepal requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \ntechnical assistance (TA) for promoting pro-poor and gender-responsive service delivery. In \nresponse, a TA to link women\u2019s participation more structurally to line agencies and local bodies \nwas endorsed in July 2003 for funding by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund. Concept \nclearance was obtained in November 2003.  The ADB Fact-Finding Mission of 21\u201330 January \n2004 consulted with representatives of the Government, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), \nand  relevant  development  partners.1  The  Mission  reached  an  understanding  with  the \nGovernment  on  the  objectives,  scope,  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan,  implementation \narrangements,  and  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  TA.2  The  technical  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Nepal's gender-related development index continues to remain lower than the human \ndevelopment index, and the gender empowerment index at 0.191 is one of the worst in the \nregion,  underscoring  the  lack  of  women\u2019s  participation  in  the  economic,  political,  and \nprofessional  spheres  vis-\u00e0-vis  men.  The  country  poverty  estimate  stands  at  38%  of  the \npopulation, but this is much higher for disadvantaged ethnic groups and castes, evidenced by a \nlow human development index for these populations. The situation of women belonging to \ndisadvantaged ethnic groups and castes is even worse, as their social indicators fall far below \nthose of their male counterparts. The Nepal Government's Tenth Plan recognizes discrimination \nbased  on  gender,  ethnicity,  and  caste,  while  reiterating  that  gender  equality  and  the \nempowerment of women are critical elements in reducing poverty. \n \n3.  Initiatives supported by ADB through a regional TA3 note that forming women\u2019s forums in \nthe village development committee (VDC) serves to build alliances for collective bargaining that \nsupport women\u2019s interests.  Actions initiated by women\u2019s groups and forums for improved \nservice delivery, however, primarily take place during a project and wane afterward.  Improving \nwomen\u2019s participation is not achieved easily. One reason for this is that most training is content-\ncentered with the objective of transferring knowledge.  The need to enable poor men and \nwomen to transcend feelings of low self-esteem, dependency, and powerlessness is largely \nignored. Even where formal rules have required women and disadvantaged populations to \nparticipate in local bodies, lack of knowledge and weak organization often prevent their effective \nparticipation. As a result, government expenditure on social services has often favored local \nelites.4  Appropriate policies and regulations are needed to strengthen the capabilities of the \npoor to direct public spending on the poor, especially the delivery of basic social and economic \nservices.   \n \n4.  Since  1995  the  Ministry  of  Women,  Children,  and  Social  Welfare  (MWCSW)  has \nendorsed a conceptual shift from women in development to gender mainstreaming. However, \nsome confusion remains evident among the Department of Women Development (DWD) and \n                                                 \n1\n The TA paper is fully supported by relevant development partners including the Department for International \nDevelopment (DFID), Netherlands Development Organization (SNV), Canadian International Development Agency \n(CIDA), and Mainstreaming Gender Equity Program (MGEP) of the United Nations Development Programme \n(UNDP), who are active in this field. \n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in February 2004. \n3 ADB. 2002. Technical assistance for Gender and Governance: Issues in Local Government.  Manila (for $600,000 \nand covering Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan; was initiated in 2002 and completed in 2004). \n4 UNDP.  2003. Gender Assessment and Gender Budget Audit of the Ministry of Local Development. Kathmandu. ", "2  \nMWCSW  how  gender  equality  should  be  incorporated.  A  recent  study  highlighted  the \nmarginalization of women\u2019s issues, and capacity building for mainstreaming gender as areas \nneeding attention.5  Initiatives supported through a regional TA 58896 show that women-only \ngroups  create  an  empowering  space,  but  efforts  to  improve  gender  responsiveness  must \ninclude  men,  so  that  both  women  and  men  support  the  changes  taking  place  in  social \norganization.  In July 2003, DWD\u2019s Women Development Section (WDS) was identified as the \nfocal point for mainstreaming gender and for coordinating nongovernment organization (NGO) \nactivities of the district. However, in the absence of policy guidelines for other line agencies to \ncollaborate  with  WDS,  and  with  sector  line  agencies  operating  their  own  women-specific \nprograms, the approach to gender mainstreaming is inconsistent.   \n \n5.  Activities in sectors such as agriculture, livestock, and water evidence specific gender \nbiases.  Men are prioritized as the primary stakeholders despite women\u2019s crucial contributions in \nthese sectors. Women's roles continue to be seen as supplementary rather than essential to \nsuccessful  sector  development.  In  the  ADB-assisted  Third  Livestock  Development  Project \n(TLDP)7, executed by the Department of Livestock (DLS) of the Ministry of Agriculture and \nCooperatives (MOAC), management has promoted channels for women development officers of \nDWD to encourage mobilization and participation of women. This approach, combined with \ntraining on gender to TLDP staff, and supportive arrangements with local NGOs, has brought \ncash and time-poor women and men into mainstream livestock activity.8 However, the linkage to \nWDS  has  remained  at  the  project  level.  Institutionalization  of  good  gender  practices  and \nlearning is necessary within DWD and MWCSW, and DLS and MOAC to progressively promote \ngender responsiveness as a core activity to accelerate poverty reduction.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n6.  The goal of the TA is to institutionalize an approach to pro-poor and gender-responsive \nservice delivery. The purpose is to develop the capacity of poor women and men beneficiaries, \nline agencies, and local elected bodies to promote pro-poor and gender-responsive service \ndelivery  in  the  agriculture  and  livestock  sectors.  Specific  outputs  include  implementing \nhomestead agricultural activities that will have quick-impact, increasing organizational capacity \nof community-based organizations (CBOs), improving livelihoods of poor rural men and women, \nstrengthening  line  agencies  and  local  bodies,  and  identifying  an  approach  that  effectively \npromotes the participation of disadvantaged groups while systematically mainstreaming gender. \nBecause livestock has a vital role in improving rural livelihoods, the TA will be undertaken in \nVDCs where the ADB-assisted Community Livestock Development Project (CLDP),9 a follow-on \nto the TLDP will be launched.10 DLS, through the TLDP, has addressed gender issues in a \nsector project and is attuned to mainstreaming gender. The TA provides an opportunity for \n                                                 \n5 UNDP. 2003.  Gender Assessment Studies and Gender Budget Audit of MWCSW. Kathmandu.  The study records \n28,641 women's groups. \n6  ADB. 1999.

Manila. \n7 Loan 1461-NEP: Third Livestock Development Project, for $27.9 million, approved on 19 September 1996. \n8  Under the present conflict situation, the use of locally based NGOs to implement projects has proven to be working \nsatisfactorily in TLDP. \n9 ADB\u2019s Board of Directors approved on 19 December 2003 Loan 2071-NEP: Community Livestock Development  \nProject  for US$20 million equivalent to the Government of Nepal. \n10 In the Microcredit Project for Women 83% of women\u2019s borrowings were for agricultural activities of which 64% went \nfor livestock raising. However, there was no synergy between this project and the TLDP. ", "    3 \norganizational linkages and exchange between DWD and DLS,11 experience for DWD to identify \ninstitutional constraints, and opportunities for developing a model for mainstreaming poverty and \ngender across sectors.12 The proposed districts are Doti and Kanchanpur, representing hill and \nterai areas in the Far-Western Development Region, where poverty is higher than the national \naverage. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The target group is women and populations belonging to disadvantaged ethnic groups \nand castes from marginal and small-scale farming households, and landless families.13 The \nmethodology adopted emphasizes participatory training, one that fosters capability development \nthrough practical experiential activities centering in problem solving. Qualified locally based \nNGOs with demonstrated experience in successfully targeting service delivery in agriculture and \nlivestock will be selected and further supported by consultants.  The TA will explore ways to \ncome up with an approach for meaningful participation of disadvantaged ethnic groups and \ncastes, and poor women.  Control groups similar to the groups participating in the CBO action \nlearning component will be identified to assess the impact of this component. Key activities \ninclude (i) improving CBO capability through action learning, (ii) building the capacity of WDS for \nmainstreaming  poverty  and  gender  concerns  in  sector  programs/projects,  (iii)  building  the \ncapacity of local bodies and line agencies, and (iv) project management services. \n \n8.  Improving CBO Capability Through Action Learning. Capability building strategies \nwill provide practical experience that will allow poor women and men to develop and utilize their \ncapacity to take initiatives for themselves. Identifying and implementing quick-impact homestead \nagricultural activities (including livestock) that result in tangible benefits within 3-8 months of \nstart will be the focal point of CBO capability development.  Activities may include homestead \ngardening, poultry, goats, etc. Each CBO will define its need, draw up a plan, assign specific \ntasks  to  its  members,  and  assess  progress  with  the  objective  of  developing  individual \ncapacities, one of which will be to work effectively within a peer group. Each CBO will receive a \nmaximum grant of $2,500 as a start-up fund to support 50 households or members. The CBO \nwill contribute at least 10-15% of the subproject cost in cash or kind.14 Locally based partner \nNGOs will assess potential CBOs, formal and informal for implementing quick-impact activities. \nEach CBO will be linked to a partner NGO, which will provide training on financial affairs, record \nkeeping,  monitoring,  group  dynamics,  leadership,  opportunity  analysis,  gender  and  social \nissues, savings mobilization, and relationship with local bodies identified through a needs \nassessment. CBO and women group leaders will receive training in needs assessment to \ndetermine and confirm their needs.  Criteria for selecting CBOs will include gender, ethnicity, \nand caste representation in its executive committee.  At least 30-50% CBOs will be represented \nby poor women, including those from disadvantaged ethnic groups and castes. After project \ncompletion,  the  District  Livestock  Service  Office  (DLSO)  and  the  District  Agriculture \nDevelopment Office (DADO) will continue to provide technical backstopping to CBOs.  \n \n                                                 \n11 DWD has recently prepared a guideline in consultation with six line ministries, including Ministry of Local \nDevelopment and MOAC, for increasing intersectoral cooperation for mainstreaming gender, and is awaiting \nCabinet approval. \n12 This will feed into the organizational audit supported by the proposed Gender Equality and Empowerment of \nWomen project.  The TA will work in VDCs not covered by that project. \n13  The criteria for selecting VDCs and NGOs will be agreed upon between DWD, DLS and ADB.   \n14 If goat raising is the selected economic activity, each group member is given three she-goats. When the goats calf, \neach recipient will give three she-goats, termed \"passing on the gift,\" to the next potential CBO. In this way, about \n80% of the total grant will keep revolving through the medium of goats. ", "4  \n9.  Building WDS Capacity for Mainstreaming Poverty and Gender Concerns in Sector \nPrograms and Projects. This component will strengthen the capacity of WDS to identify \npoverty and gender concerns in the agriculture and livestock sectors and determine what \nactions  are  needed  to  promote  poor  men  and  women's  participation,  and  how  gender \nperspectives influence poverty outcomes.  Linkage with CLDP will provide hands-on experience. \nAfter a needs assessment, WDS will receive training to fulfill its role as a coordinator of NGO \nactivities  such  as  assessing  NGO  performance,  developing  criteria,  and  establishing  and \nmaintaining a database of NGO and CBOs in the district. Each WDS will enter into a partnership \nwith at least seven NGOs per district and, with guidance from DWD will oversee implementation \nof CBO quick-impact action learning initiatives.  \n \n10.  Capacity Building for Local Bodies and Line Agencies. In line with the Local Self \nGovernance Act and building on work initiated by CIDA and SNV15 support will be provided to \nestablish and strengthen gender subcommittees in the district development committees (DDCs) \non the basis of guidelines developed by the Ministry of Local Development. Capacity building \nwill focus on strengthening the gender subcommittee's ability to monitor CBO quick-impact \nimplementation activities. DDCs will undertake a gender organizational audit of the DDC using \nthe manual developed by SNV. DWD will conduct capacity building training for VDC and DDC, \nCLDP and DLSO, and DADO officials.  Participatory community social maps prepared by CBOs \nwill be used to identify where and how VDC and DDC activities have focused and the primary \nbeneficiaries, to enable local organizations to steer development efforts to the underserved \npopulations.  \n \n11.   Project Management Services.  The TA will support strengthening the management \ncapacity of DWD and WDS in the financial and technical assistance areas to ensure effective \nimplementation of project activities. DWD at the start of the TA will prepare a work plan \nidentifying training needs of all central and district stakeholders, required resources, and an \nimplementation  schedule.  The  management  processes  will  emphasize  learning  from \nimplementation experience, distilling strategies, best practices, and incentives for participation \nand accountability at the local level. A key output will be a road map for scaling up similar \nactivities,  a  policy  decision  for  intersectoral  cooperation  on  gender  mainstreaming,  and \ninstitutionalization of good practices. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $250,000  equivalent,  comprising  foreign \nexchange cost of $30,000 and a local currency cost of $220,000 equivalent. ADB will finance \n$200,000  comprising  all  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $170,000  equivalent  of  the  local \ncurrency cost.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation \nFund, and administered by ADB. The Government of Nepal will finance the remaining local \ncurrency cost of $50,000 equivalent by providing office accommodation, counterpart staff, and \nother miscellaneous expenditures.  Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \n                                                 \n15\n The Canada-Nepal Gender in Organizations (CNGO) Project funded by CIDA has developed the capacity of NGOs \nin six districts, including Doti, to become gender resource organizations and to develop collaborative relationships \nwith DDCs.  SNV has prepared a guideline to form a gender subcommittee in the DDC and supported preparation \nof gender self audit manual for assisting the DDC to integrate gender concerns in all its programs and policies.    ", "    5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  DWD will be the Executing Agency responsible for overall project management. A \nproject steering committee (PSC) chaired by the secretary of MWCSW and comprising joint \nsecretaries of MWCSW, MOAC, and Ministry of Local Development; and director generals of \nDWD  and  DLS  will  be  formed  to  ensure  coordination  and  make  policy  decisions  on \nmainstreaming gender issues. WDS of DWD will be the implementing agency and will work in \npartnership with locally based NGOs. In the district a committee comprising representatives of \nWDS, DLSO, DDC and VDC, and chaired by the women development officer will be formed to \nselect NGOs and to monitor implementation of CBO and NGO activities. The Government will \ndepute one of the directors of DWD as project manager to supervise all project activities; and \nprovide sufficient counterpart staff, office space, equipment, and local communication facilities \nat the center and the project districts for the counterparts and consultants. Additional necessary \noffice  equipment  required  for  the  TA  will  be  procured  following  ADB's  Guidelines  for \nProcurement. The PSC will prepare and approve an operating modality between DWD and DLS \nto oversee implementation of quick impact activities. The steering committee will meet at the \nbeginning of the TA, and at least four times a year thereafter to resolve any policy issue. \nDomestic consultants and one short-term international consultant will assist the project manager \nin  overall  management,  procedures  for  intersectoral  collaboration  and  cooperation,  and \nmonitoring and supervision under the guidance of the director general of DWD. \n \n14.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months from July 2004 to January 2006. The \nconsulting services for the TA total 31.5 person-months: 1.5 person-months international, and \n30  domestic.  The  consultants  will  have  a  mix  of  skills  and  expertise  in  organizational \ndevelopment, participatory processes, gender and social issues, and monitoring and evaluation. \nThe consultants will be selected and engaged individually in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants, and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic \nconsultants.  The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. Joint monitoring by DWD, DLS, \nDDC, and ADB will be undertaken at least four times a year. The findings will be disseminated \nthrough one national and three district workshops, using project participants as key presenters.  \n \n15.  An advance payment facility will be used to implement the TA. The advance will be \ncredited to the account number provided by DWD for the TA. From the DWD project operating \naccount, funds will be made available to WDS, through the district development funds into each \nWDS's project operating account to implement improvement of CBO capability through action \nlearning  activities.  The  WDS  accountant  will  establish  and  maintain  all  statement  of \nexpenditures  (SOE).    WDS  project  operating  account  will  be  audited  through  the  Auditor \nGeneral's Office and submitted to DWD through DDC.  DWD will ensure all project operating \naccounts are established, maintained, and audited. DWD will submit to ADB trimester progress \nreports on implementation. An auditor acceptable to ADB will annually audit the account and \nSOEs related to the TA. Audited financial statements and account, together with the report of \nthe auditor, will be submitted within 9 months of the close of the financial year.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $200,000 to the Government \nof Nepal to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund for \nPromoting Pro-Poor and Gender-Responsive Service Delivery, and hereby reports this action to \nthe Board.
