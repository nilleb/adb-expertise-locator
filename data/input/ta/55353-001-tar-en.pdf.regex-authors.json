The  proposed  transaction  technical  assistance  (TRTA)  will  design,  set  up,  and \noperationalize the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Frontier Financing Partnership Facility (ADB \nFrontier). ADB Frontier will house multi-donor trust funds and technical assistance (TA) that \nsupport and invest in private companies with potential to generate sustainable development goal \n(SDG) impact in frontier markets in Asia and the Pacific.1  \n \n2.  ADB  Frontier  fills  an  operations  gap.  It  will  allow  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations \nDepartment (PSOD) to take on more risk in pursuit of greater developmental impact by making \nsmaller investments in frontier markets that struggle to attract commercial financing. The initial \npilot will focus on tourism and light manufacturing companies in Southeast Asia and the Pacific. \nADB Frontier will initially house an investment trust fund (ADB Frontier Fund) and a technical \nassistance (ADB Frontier TA). PSOD will take a One ADB approach by jointly designing and \nimplementing  ADB  Frontier  with  the  Southeast  Asia  Department  (SERD)  and  the  Pacific \nDepartment (PARD) to leverage ADB operations and networks in frontier markets.  \n     \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  Risk capital needed to drive impact in frontier markets. Commercial banks typically \ndo not lend to young and growing businesses with limited track records. This segment of the small \nand medium-sized enterprise sector are often too large to be served by microfinance institutions, \nyet too small for commercial banks. They require \u2018risk capital\u2019 \u2013 forms of finance that have higher \nrisk tolerance than bank loans. During 2011\u20132020, risk capital inflows into frontier markets in \nADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs) represented just 0.1% of the total flow to all DMCs, \nabout 50 times less per capita than the average for all DMCs.2 Risk capital investments can \nhowever have a significant catalytic impact in frontier markets, even with relatively low commercial \nreturns. Funding is needed to catalyze the emergence of new industry leaders and/or scale \nbusinesses that can partner with multinational corporates. This will enable new entrants to bring \ninnovation that enhances the competitiveness and sustainability of local industries, create jobs, \nand provide essential goods and services. Such investments also have meaningful macro-level \nimpacts such as contributing taxes that support essential public services.3 \n \n4.  Limited risk capital in frontier markets. The availability of risk capital is limited in frontier \nmarkets because the average risk-adjusted investment returns are lowered by: (i) idiosyncratic \nrisks that can unexpectedly fully or partially write off investments including disasters triggered by \nnatural hazards, civil unrest, or other events that are exacerbated by weaker state capacity; \n(ii) market  risks  undermining  investment  returns  including  inadequate  infrastructure,  limited \nmanagement talent/human capital, macroeconomic instability, and weak business regulatory \n                                                \n1  Frontier markets are defined in this TRTA to include all ADB developing members countries (DMC) that are \ncategorized by ADB as small island developing states (SIDS), fragile and conflict-affected situations (FCAS), Group \nA DMCs, and/or Group B DMCs with a population less than 25 million. As of 30 November 2021, DMCs eligible for \nassistance from the proposed ADB Frontier facility include Bhutan, Cambodia, the Cook Islands, Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Kyrgyz Republic, Marshall Islands, Maldives, \nMongolia, Nauru, Nepal, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tajikistan, Timor-Leste, Tonga, \nTuvalu, and Vanuatu. Afghanistan and Myanmar will also be eligible if and when ADB resumes in-country operations. \nNiue will be included, effective 1 January 2022, in line with its classification as a Group B DMC. For further details of \nDMC categorizations see ADB. 2019. Classification and Graduation of Developing Member Countries. Manila.  \n2  Preqin database (accessed 30 September 2021). \n3  IFC. 2015. Risk Capital in Emerging Markets and the SME Ventures Model. \n ", "2   \n \nenvironments; and (iii) higher transaction costs due to elevated origination and due diligence costs, \nand the need for more active portfolio support as companies tend to be smaller and less mature. \n \n5.  Due to their smaller market size, frontier markets are typically characterized by lack of \nliquidity, underdeveloped capital markets, and low levels of private sector credit. Banks tend to \nfavor large clients and short-term investments such as government treasury bills, showing little \nappetite for higher risk unsecured products often needed by small and medium-sized enterprises. \n \n6.  Opportunities in frontier markets. While investing in frontier markets poses significant \nchallenges, there are also factors that create opportunities for entrepreneurs. There is typically \nlower competition (including from foreign entrants) in these smaller markets so there may be first-\nmover advantages. Cost of unskilled labor is also typically lower in many frontier markets. There \nare examples of successful businesses that: (i) export niche products and services taking \nadvantage  of  local  comparative  advantages,  (ii)  import  substitute  products  not  adequately \nsupplied by international providers including opportunities to supply to multinational corporates, \nand (iii) deliver essential services for local industries under restricted domestic competition (e.g., \nrestricted licensing and/or high barriers to entry). \n \n7.  Economic  structure  in  frontier  markets.  There  is  heterogeneity  in  the  economic \nstructure of frontier markets. The tourism industry is a particularly vital contributor to gross \ndomestic product, foreign exchange earnings, and job creation in most small island developing \nstates (SIDS). Tourism is also an important driver of inclusive economic growth in other frontier \nmarkets where the benefits of extractive industries tend not to trickle down to local communities. \nWomen\u2019s share of employment also tends to be relatively high in the tourism sector and services \nbroadly. Light manufacturing can be a promising source of livelihood generation and income \ndiversification, including in most fragile and conflict-affected situations (FCAS) and land-locked \neconomies  that  are  reliant  on  commodity  exports.  With  a  few  exceptions,  however,  the \nmanufacturing industry remains nascent in most frontier markets.  \n \n8.  COVID-19 impact. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) severely set back economic \ngrowth in small and open frontier markets, which were amongst the most severely affected by the \npandemic. In 2020, gross domestic product declined by an average 9 percentage basis points \nacross frontier markets in Asia and the Pacific compared to 2019, with tourism dependent \neconomies particularly hard hit.4 The geographic remoteness of frontier markets affected all \nindustries as transportation and supply-chains were severely disrupted. COVID-19 also set back \nthe market-creation process for funds providing risk capital to frontier markets as investors \noperated with more conservative capital structures and reduced exposure to higher risk markets. \n \n9.  ADB private sector operations in frontier markets. Out of a total of about 300 ADB \nprivate sector transactions during 2007\u20132020 only 29 were in frontier markets. Of these only 4 \nwere non-infrastructure.5 ADB can also reach frontier markets through investing in regional \nprivate equity funds, however during 2006\u20132017 only 0.6% of funding by the 34 funds that ADB \ninvested in went towards investees in frontier markets (about $0.15 per capita which is 7 times \nless than other DMCs).6  ADB has committed to expanding and diversifying its private sector \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2021. Asian Development Outlook 2021: Financing a Green and Inclusive Recovery. Manila. \n5  These included 3 agribusiness deals (2 in Mongolia and 1 in Bhutan) and 1 private equity deal (Myanmar). \n6  Of the private equity funds ADB invested in during 2006\u20132017, 76% were regionally focused but the underlying \nportfolio company data shows that 36% of all ADB commitments to funds went to portfolio investments in India, 30% \nin the Peoples Republic of China, 8% in the Philippines, and 7% in Indonesia. \n ", "  3 \n \noperations in frontier markets.7   In 2019, ADB launched the Private Sector Window (PSW) to \npromote private sector operations in Group A DMCs by providing blended finance to projects in \nthe infrastructure, financial institution, agribusiness, and social sectors.8  \n \n10.  Support for improved business enabling environment. ADB and other development \npartners have provided sustained and significant policy advisory and capacity-building assistance \nto improve the business enabling environment in frontier markets.9 This includes on-going support \nto improve access to financial services, reforms to a wide range of business regulations, and \nrestructuring of state-owned enterprises. High levels of overseas development assistance per \ncapita  in  frontier  markets  also  include  business  grants  but  these  may  distort  financial \nintermediation and crowd out commercial financing. \n \n11.  Lessons  from  past  operations.  ADB  has  limited  experience  investing  in  non-\ninfrastructure sectors in frontier markets, including investments in the Kula Funds that focused on \nPacific DMCs.10 Past ADB and other development partner project evaluations recognize that \ngreater uptake of private sector operations in frontier markets require: (i) an impact-first approach \nthat tolerates lower commercial returns than would typically be targeted by private investors, \n(ii) subsidization  of  fund  operations  to  cover  higher  fund  management  costs  including  the \nnecessary intensive support for portfolio companies, and (iii) streamlined business processes and \nprocedures that reduce the transaction costs of originating and processing smaller deals. ADB \nhas experience of streamlining business processes for smaller deals under ADB Ventures.11 \n \nB.  Outcome and Outputs \n \n12.  Impact and outcome. The TA will generate impact by supporting and investing in private \ncompanies that contribute to SDG impact in frontier markets in Asia and the Pacific. The outcome \nwill be operationalization of ADB Frontier (Linked Document 1).  \n \n13.  ADB Frontier. The design of the new facility will be informed by TRTA outputs (para. 17) \nand build on the lessons from past and current private sector operations in frontier markets (para. \n11), including the experience of streamlining business processes for ADB Ventures. ADB Frontier \noperations will provide a cost-effective, results-orientated, and sustainable complement to other \nongoing ADB and development partner initiatives that support the business enabling environment \nin  these  markets.  It  will  complement  ADB\u2019s  PSW  by  making  direct  investments  in  non-\ninfrastructure sectors. ADB Frontier will initially have two components:  \n \n(i)  ADB Frontier Fund. ADB is currently seeking funding commitments of at least \n$20 million from concessional funding sources to establish and operationalize the \nADB Frontier Fund. The fund would target financial sustainability and recycle such \nprofits as may be derived from investments back into the fund. The fund will provide \nfinancing indicatively up to $4 million per transaction to private companies. Target \nbusiness  models  will  have  the  potential  to  transform  the  tourism  and  light \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2018.

The fund will \nfocus on export-orientated and import substitution companies that take advantage \nof a unique local comparative advantage. ADB Frontier would be able to lead \ntransactions and aims to crowd in commercial risk capital primarily through follow-\non financing raised by portfolio companies. This multi-donor fund would consider \na variety of instruments suitable for frontier markets including flexible revenue-\nbased instruments. The investment strategy and specific funding instruments to be \ndeployed will be determined by market diagnostics that determine funding gaps in \ntargeted frontier markets and industries (TRTA output 1). ADB would be the \ninvestor-of-record for the fund\u2019s investments. Approval for the establishment and \nadministration of this fund will be sought separately once fund-raising discussions \nhave resulted in the necessary commitments by third party donors.  \n \n(ii)  ADB Frontier TA program (indicative $8 million TA for 2023\u20132026, of which ADB \nwill  seek  cofinancing  commitments  of  $6  million)  with  three  main  activities: \n(a) subsidization of fund operational costs including fund management, safeguard \nand  impact  specialists  (including  environmental,  social,  and  gender  [ESG]), \nintegrity due diligence, legal transaction support, and administration costs, (b) pre-\ninvestment facilitation  including  support for  local  business  support  programs, \npartnerships with multinationals operating within the regional and global supply-\nchains of targeted sectors, and building the capacity of regional and local investor \nnetworks, and (c) post-investment portfolio support including for accounting and \ninventory management systems,  ESG and impact tools, digital transformation, \ncorporate governance, and communications. Select activities will be piloted under \nthis TRTA. Recipient companies will share TA costs. \n \n14.  Regional cooperation and integration. ADB Frontier will foster regional cooperation and \nintegration (RCI) by supporting and investing in export-orientated businesses in frontier markets. \nInvestments will increase the cross-border flow of goods and services, including foreign exchange \nearnings from inbound tourists and export of manufactured products. ADB Frontier will take a RCI \napproach by partnering with multinational corporations operating in the tourism and manufacturing \nsupply-chains across multiple frontier markets. RCI will also be encouraged through collaboration \nand knowledge sharing between regional investors and business support providers that focus on \nsmall and medium size businesses operating in these markets. The TRTA is aligned with the \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 Operational Priority 7 on RCI. \n  \n15.  Gender impact. ADB Frontier will apply a gender equality scorecard to evaluate all \npotential investee\u2019s gender inclusiveness on six dimensions: suppliers, customers, ownership, \nleadership, workers, and corporate practices.  \n \n16.  ADB additionality. With commitments of $6.6 billion in frontier markets during 2020, ADB \nhas unique convening power, networks, and resources to support private companies operating in \nthese markets. Financial additionality includes: (i) filling a significant private sector financing gap \nin these markets through the provision of patient risk capital, and (ii) credibility of ADB brand that \ncan  crowd-in  impact  investors.  Technical  additionality  includes:  (i)  strong  government \nrelationships, (ii) regional convening power, (iii) operation at scale with critical mass to sustain \nlong-term strategic engagement, and (iv) honest broker role to foster industry collaboration.  \n \n17.
