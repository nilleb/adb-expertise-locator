I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) a proposed grant, both to Nepal for the Integrated Urban Development Project.1 \n \n2.  The  project  will  provide  the  population  in  the  municipalities  of  Dharan,  Janakpur, \nNepalgunj, and Siddharthanagar with better access to municipal infrastructure and services in a \nsocially inclusive manner.2 In accordance with the priorities of each municipality, integrated \nurban  environmental  improvements,  including  drainage  systems,  solid  waste  management \n(SWM)  facilities,  and  urban  roads,  will  be  implemented  in  Janakpur,  Nepalgunj,  and \nSiddharthanagar municipalities. A water supply development subproject will be implemented in \nDharan municipality. The project will also undertake community development programs (CDPs), \nfocusing primarily on poverty pockets in the municipalities and communities that may not benefit \ndirectly from major infrastructure improvement subprojects. Gender equality and social inclusion \n(GESI) will be mainstreamed in all subprojects in the municipalities, and the capacity to address \nGESI  in  the  Ministry  of  Physical  Planning  and  Works  (MPPW)  will  be  strengthened  by \nestablishing an appropriate institutional structure and mechanisms for GESI mainstreaming. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The pace of urbanization in Nepal has increased markedly during 2001\u20132011 with an \nurban population growth rate of 3.4% per annum, compared with national population growth of \n1.4% per annum. In 2011, 17% of the population was estimated to live in urban areas, up from \n9.2%  in  1991  and  13.9%  in  2001.  While  global  experience  clearly  demonstrates  that \nurbanization  is  an  important  driver  of  economic  development,  the  potential  has  not  been \nadequately tapped in Nepal. In the absence of a stringent policy regulating and managing \ngrowth,  uncontrolled  and  haphazard  urban  development  has  created  numerous  problems, \nincluding deficiencies in basic urban services; environmental degradation; encroachment on \npublic land, forests, and river banks; and sprawling settlement development. Most municipalities \nin  Nepal  lack  properly  engineered  and  operated  sanitary  landfills,  and  have  limited  and \nintermittent  water  supply  services,  poorly  maintained  road  infrastructure,  and  inadequate \ndrainage systems that cause recurrent waterlogging problems, mainly in the Terai.3  The Local \nSelf Governance Act mandates a wide range of functions and responsibilities to municipalities, \nbut the lack of financial and qualified human resources and a low level of institutional capacity \nmake providing infrastructure facilities commensurate with the growing demand for services a \nmajor challenge. Poor health, caused by the poor urban environment, saps economic growth by \nreducing labor productivity and educational attainment. Disease, associated economic burden, \nand premature death disproportionately affect the poor and vulnerable.  \n \n4.  The National Urban Policy (NUP) adopted by the Government of Nepal in 2007 gives \npriority  to  (i)  achieving  a  balanced  national  urban  structure  by  directing  infrastructure \ndevelopment and investment;4 (ii) improving the quality of urban life through creation of a clean, \nsafe, and well-developed urban environment; and (iii) setting up effective urban management by \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance (TA), financed on a grant \nbasis from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. \n3  The Terai is the southern plain area bordering India. \n4  A \"balanced national urban structure\" consists of urban development that is equally managed in all development \nregions. \n ", "2 \nempowering capable local institutions. Both the NUP and the government\u2019s Three-Year Plan \nApproach Paper (FY2011\u2013FY2013) place municipalities at the core of the urban development \nagenda,  and  support  strengthening  local  bodies,  so  they  can  effectively  implement  urban \ndevelopment plans and mobilize local resources. Although the policy intent is clear, effective \nimplementation  of  the  policy  framework  is  hindered  by  numerous  problems,  including  the \nabsence of people\u2019s representatives in local bodies, lack of technical and skilled local-level \nmanpower, failure to execute important aspects of decentralization and devolution, and lack of \nclarity  in  the  roles  of  and  collaboration  among  government  ministries,  local  bodies,  and \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs). \n \n5.  Urban services are scarce outside Kathmandu Valley. Physical limitations restrict further \ndevelopment in the valley, and there is an urgent need to improve the environment in potential \nurban centers to promote social and economic development in other regions of Nepal. The \ngovernment, represented by the Department of Urban Development and Building Construction \n(DUDBC), developed the criteria for selecting strategically important towns. Dharan, Janakpur, \nNepalgunj, and Siddharthanagar were chosen for the project on the basis of (i) economic growth \npotential, (ii) demand for urban services, and (iii) urban management capacity.5 The project \ndirectly addresses and conforms to the development policy of Nepal, as expressed in the NUP \nand Three-Year Plan Approach Paper, by improving the environment of urban centers that work \nas catalysts for economic development, which will help contribute to the \u2015employment-centric, \nequitable, and inclusive economic growth\u2016 emphasized by the approach paper. \n \n6.  Urban infrastructure and facilities have tended not to fully recognize social differences in \nthe needs of women, the poor, and excluded groups. People living in municipal poverty pockets \nexperience  discrimination  based  on  gender,  caste,  and  ethnicity,  and  multiple  exclusions \nconstrain their progress and access to services. Their participation in community activities is \nlimited due to lack of access to information and resources, although progress has been made \nthrough support for their empowerment and mobilization from various NGOs and development \npartners. To be effective, urban development must integrate GESI. \n \n7.  The  project  is  in  line  with  the  Nepal  country  partnership  strategy  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB),6 which rests on four pillars: broad-based and inclusive economic \ngrowth, inclusive social development, governance and capacity building, and climate change \nadaptation  and  environmental  sustainability.  Reflecting  lessons  from  similar  projects,7 the \nproject (i) focuses on a small number of physically integrated components, to simplify project \nadministration and optimize inter-sector linkages; (ii) is confined to larger municipalities with \nrelatively higher technical and financial capacity to implement the project and create discernable \ndevelopment  impacts;  (iii)  fully  involves  stakeholders,  including  communities,  in  project \nidentification and design from an early stage; (iv) provides capacity development support before \n                                                \n5  This process was supported by ADB. 2008.

Dharan is the second largest municipality in the eastern region after \nBiratnagar, and rapidly growing as a major trading center and educational and health services hub with a \npopulation of 119,000 in 2011. Janakpur is considered a key regional hub in the central region, with a population of \n100,000 in 2011. Nepalgunj is referred to in the NUP as the potential regional economic center in the mid-western \nregion with a population of 76,000 in 2011 (the largest in the region). Siddharthanagar is a rapidly growing regional \ntrading hub (along with Butwal) in the western region, with a population of 65,000 in 2011.  \n6  ADB. 2009.

Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The impact will be the improved urban environment in the municipalities of Dharan, \nJanakpur, Nepalgunj, and Siddharthanagar. The outcome will be to provide population in these \nmunicipalities with better access to municipal infrastructure and services in a socially inclusive \nmanner. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n9.  The project will have the following outputs. \n \n10.  Output  1:  Reliable  municipal  infrastructure  developed.  Subprojects  will  be \nimplemented to develop reliable municipal infrastructure in accordance with the priorities set by \nthe municipalities in their periodic plans.9 \n \n11.  Drainage  and  roads. Three project municipalities on the flat land of the Terai are \nchronically waterlogged\u2014particularly Nepalgunj and Siddhrthanagar, and to a lesser extent \nJanakpur\u2014because  of  inadequate,  poorly  built,  and  poorly  maintained  drainage  and \nobstructions from solid waste dumping.10 There is no overall planning, leading to haphazard \nconstruction on a piecemeal basis, and drainage capacity is reduced in some natural drains due \nto encroachment. Pipes carrying untreated sewage effluent are often connected to the drainage \nsystem, causing bad odors and public health risks. These systems will be improved under a \ncomprehensive drainage development plan to alleviate waterlogging and reduce the resulting \ndamage to assets, economic activities, and human health. Future increases in rainfall intensity \nwill be addressed during the drainage system detailed design to strengthen urban resilience to \nclimate change. Urban roads are dilapidated, especially in Janakpur, and they will be restored \nor upgraded in areas where drainage network improvements are undertaken. \n \n12.  Solid waste management. Waste collection coverage in Janakpur is estimated at 40%, \nin Nepalgunj at 70%, and in Siddharthanagar at 56%. Without a sanitary landfill, collected waste \nis dumped haphazardly along riverbanks and into open spaces, causing pollution and public \nhealth hazards. Littering of waste in drains is common, segregation at source is rarely practiced, \nand waste recycling is far below the optimum level. The project will take an integrated approach \nto SWM by reviewing and improving the entire system, including (i) segregation and collection; \n(ii)  waste  reduction,  reuse,  and  recycling;  and  (iii)  transportation  and  final  disposal  at  the \nsanitary  landfill  site,  including  resource  recovery  facilities  in  Janakpur,  Nepalgunj,  and \n                                                \n8  Capacity development TA was provided to the project municipalities to (i) prepare a comprehensive financial \nmanagement improvement plan for each municipality that includes measures for revenue enhancement and \nimproving accounting and auditing practices; and (ii) strengthen technical capacity of municipal staff through \ntraining programs on solid waste management, water supply and sanitation (including drainage), geographic \ninformation systems, and infrastructure planning. ADB. 2009.  Technical Assistance to Nepal for Institutional \nStrengthening of Municipalities. Manila. As the TA was mainly intended for the municipalities supported under the \nSecondary Towns Integrated Urban Environmental Improvement Project, another capacity development TA was \napproved to assist the project municipalities in implementing comprehensive financial management improvement \nplans, including revenue enhancement, and improving urban planning.  ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance to Nepal \nfor Strengthening Municipalities for Urban Service Delivery. Manila. \n9  Periodic  plans  are  medium-term  development  plans  prepared  by  each  municipality  through  a  participatory \napproach, as required by the Local Self Governance Act (1999). A periodic plan was prepared in Dharan in 2010 \nand in the other three municipalities in 2011. \n10 Dharan has reasonable natural slopes and very porous soil, and drainage problems are not observed.  \n ", "4 \nSiddharthanagar.11 Strengthening waste reduction, reuse, and recycling will lead to a reduction \nin greenhouse gas emissions, and extend the service life of and reduce pollution risks at landfill \nsites. The possibility of private sector participation in SWM services (including landfill operation) \nwill be explored by incorporating management services in the civil works contract to ensure \neffective and efficient operation of the system.12 \n \n13.  Water  supply. As there is no known accessible groundwater in the town and very \nlimited other reliable sources, there is complete dependence on the piped water supply system \nin Dharan. Dharan suffers low service levels provided by the Nepal Water Supply Corporation \nwith only 4 hours per day of supply in the dry season.13 Water supply subproject in Dharan will \ninclude (i) development of new deep tubewells for water supply augmentation, (ii) rehabilitation \nand  replacement  of  existing  system  to  enhance  efficiency  including  non-revenue  water \nreduction, and (iii) expansion of the distribution network to increase the coverage to 95% from \ncurrent 83%.  The project will support the establishment of Dharan Water Supply Management \nBoard14 (DWSMB), which will take charge of operation and maintenance (O&M), including (i) \nasset valuation and transfer, (ii) institutional development including the drafting of regulations \nand a business plan, and (iii) system integration. \n \n14.  Consulting  services  for  design,  construction  supervision,  and  support  for  the  initial \noperation of facilities created under the project will be provided. The services will also include (i) \nsupport in setting and collecting adequate tariffs, taxes, and other charges to ensure sustainable \nO&M; and (ii) assessment of the appropriate O&M arrangement, particularly for integrated SWM \nfacilities. \n \n15.  Output 2: Community development programs undertaken and gender equality and \nsocial  inclusion  capacity  strengthened.  This  output  will  be  achieved  through  the \nimplementation of (i) CDPs in the project municipalities; and (ii) capacity development activities \nfor gender  and social  inclusion  mainstreaming  in  the  MPPW,  its  three  departments,15 and \nproject municipalities. The CDPs will mainly focus on poverty pockets in the municipalities and \ncommunities that may not benefit directly from major infrastructure improvement subprojects \nand will consist of (i) investment in small-scale community infrastructure chosen in accordance \nwith the subproject selection criteria,16 such as public and community toilets, lane and drainage \nimprovements,  community  composting  facilities,  and  community  water  taps;  (ii)  social \nmobilization  and  information,  education,  and  communication  campaigns  with  a  particular \nemphasis on health and hygiene education and waste reduction, reuse, and recycling activities; \nand (iii) skill and entrepreneurship development targeting women, the poor, and the excluded. A \nportion of the community infrastructure work may be used to support access by the poor to \nwater supply and sanitation at the individual household level, such as private latrines and \nprivate connections to water supply services through performance-based grants such as output-\nbased aid. Activities pertaining to GESI will include (i) formation of structures and mechanisms \nfor GESI mainstreaming in the MPPW and its departments; (ii) preparation of GESI operational \nmanuals, toolkits, and checklists for road, water supply and sanitation, and urban development \noperations;  (iii)  technical  training  programs  for  MPPW  staff  and  departments,  and  project \n                                                \n11 A regional SWM project is being implemented in Dharan. \n12 The assessment during project preparation suggests a 3\u20135 year management contract be incorporated in the civil \nwork contract, while further work will be made before finalizing the arrangement.  \n13 This is in contrast with other three municipalities, where shallow and private tubewells are widely available despite \nthe lower coverage of piped water supply. \n14 This will follow the Water Supply Management Board Act (2006).  \n15 Department of Roads, DUDBC, and Department of Water Supply and Sewerage. Their regional directorates and \ndivisional offices will also be covered. \n16 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \nmunicipalities; and (iv) review and revision of policies and regulations relevant to sectors under \nthe jurisdiction of MPPW for GESI integration. \n \n16.  NGOs  will  be  engaged  by  the  municipalities  to  assist  in  CDP  implementation,  and \nconsultants will be engaged by the MPPW for capacity development of the MPPW and its \ndepartments. Design and supervision consultants will assist in institutional strengthening of \nproject municipalities on GESI issues. \n \n17.  Output  3:  Project  management  and  administration  supported.  Support  will  be \nprovided  for  smooth  and  effective  project  implementation  and  operation  by  the  central \ngovernment and project municipalities. The project coordination office (PCO) in the DUDBC will \nmanage overall project implementation, assisted by the project management support consultant. \nThe project implementation units (PIUs) in each project municipality will implement infrastructure \nimprovement and CDP. The GESI unit will be established in the MPPW to mainstream GESI in \nits operations and those of its three departments, with support from the consultants. \n \nD.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n22.  Subproject selection considered priorities set by the municipalities and communities, \nbasic minimum service requirements, affordability on the part of municipalities and beneficiaries, \nand capacity of the municipalities for implementation and O&M. In Janakpur, Nepalgunj, and \nSiddharthanagar, priority areas for drainage improvement were carefully selected to save costs \nwhile maintaining most benefits. Road improvements will be limited to areas where drainage is \nimproved to ensure inter-sector complementarity. Although onsite sanitation systems with septic \ntanks are available in  all project municipalities, poorly working septic tanks  that discharge \nuntreated wastewater into the drains are causing health risks, particularly by contaminating the \nshallow  groundwater  in  the  Terai.  Therefore,  the  project  municipalities  will  strengthen  the \nmonitoring of regular septic tank cleaning, and a sludge drying bed will be constructed at the \nlandfill site. In Dharan, an analysis concluded that the groundwater scheme for water supply \naugmentation is technically and financially more advantageous than the surface water scheme. \nA centralized wastewater management system is currently considered unnecessary because (i) \nthe existing onsite systems are generally functioning well in Dharan, with improved monitoring of \nseptic tank cleaning supported by the project; and (ii) there is no concern about groundwater \ncontamination due to the depth of groundwater (about 200 meters). \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n23.  The public investment to be made under the project, including community infrastructure \nand programs to increase community awareness on public health and hygiene, will have a \nsubstantial impact on the urban environment and public health improvement. Economic benefits \nconsidered in the economic analysis were (i) savings in business losses, road maintenance \ncosts, and property maintenance costs for the drainage system improvement; (ii) revenue from \nproduction of compost and recyclable materials and reduced health risks and medical expenses \nfor the SWM improvement; (iii) savings in vehicle operating costs and travel time costs for the \nroad system improvement; and (iv) non-incremental water sales in the form of resource cost \n ", "8 \nsavings, incremental water sales, and reduced medical expenses for the water supply system \nimprovement. The results of the economic analysis show that all proposed subprojects were \neconomically robust, with economic internal rates of return ranging from 14.6% to 39.5%, higher \nthan the economic opportunity cost of capital. \n \n24.  Financial analysis was conducted only for the water supply system improvement in \nDharan, as other subprojects will not be intended for direct cost recovery. The financial internal \nrate of return was estimated at 0.26%, which is nearly equal to the weighted average cost of \ncapital, estimated at 0.30%.The low financial internal rate of return is the result of a balance \nbetween financial sustainability and affordability. However, even under the adverse conditions, \nthe projected cash flow of Dharan municipality will be sufficient to cover O&M expenditure and \ndebt service. For nonrevenue-generating subprojects, the analysis focused on financial capacity \nof  project municipalities  to meet  the recurrent  costs  required  to  operate  and maintain  the \ndeveloped physical assets in a sustainable manner. An assessment of the financial position of \nthe  municipalities  has  found  these  public  investments  to  be  financially  sustainable  with \nimplementation  of  revenue-enhancement  measures  set  out  in  the  comprehensive  financial \nmanagement improvement plan that each municipality is committed to implement (footnote 8). \n \nC.  Governance \n \n25.  An assessment of financial management and procurement capacity undertaken during \nproject preparation indicates that DUDBC and TDF have a satisfactory record from previous \nprojects and can effectively manage loan and grant proceeds for project implementation. While \nthe project municipalities  lack experience on large-scale projects financed by development \npartners, the financial management risks are mitigated through capacity development technical \nassistance projects (footnote 8). Other risk-mitigation measures include (i) adequate training in \nADB procedures for the municipal staff, and (ii) engagement of a procurement specialist and a \nfinancial management specialist as consultants to assist the municipalities. ADB and other \ndevelopment partners are supporting capacity building of relevant central government agencies \nto  strengthen  supervisory  functions  on  public  procurement.  Transparency  in  procurement, \nfinancing, and other matters will be maximized through measures that include (i) development \nby DUDBC of a project website, and (ii) local-level stakeholder consultations and information \ndisclosure. \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and municipalities. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n27.  The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. The support provided for \nGESI institutional capacity building is expected to enable MPPW to address poverty and social \ninequality issues. The improvements to be made by the project in water supply, drainage, and \nSWM  systems  will  produce  significant  public  health  benefits  to  the  community  in  general, \nincluding the poor. The CDP focuses on municipal poverty pockets, and women, the poor, and \nother  vulnerable  groups  will  benefit  from  small-scale  community  infrastructure,  a  social \nmobilization program, and skills and entrepreneurship development support. These programs \nwill be implemented in a consultative and participatory manner with appropriate representation \nof women in the poor settlements. A GESI action plan with specific targets for all project \nactivities will be implemented to ensure gender equality and social inclusiveness by addressing \nthe different needs of women and vulnerable groups. \n ", "9 \nE.  Safeguards \n \n28.  Environmental safeguards. The project is classified as environmental category B. Four \ninitial environmental examinations including environmental management plans were prepared in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  government  laws,  and \ndisclosed. Subprojects are not located in or near sensitive or protected areas, and the initial \nenvironmental examinations conclude that no significant adverse impacts are anticipated from \nproposed locations, designs, and construction activities. The environmental management plans \nprovide adequate mitigation measures to ensure impacts are limited and of short duration. The \nnet environmental benefits will be positive and large, including reduced (i) urban flooding from \nimproved  drainage  systems,  and  (ii)  environmental  pollution  from  improved  SWM. \nImplementation  arrangements  in  the  PCO  build  on  experience gained  through  ADB  urban \nprojects, and consultant support will enable the PIUs to manage environmental impacts. The \nPCO will provide environmental reports to ADB semiannually. An environmental assessment \nand  review  framework  was  prepared  to  address  small  components,  which  will  be  defined \nthrough detailed design, following approval by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \n29.  Social safeguards. The project is classified as category B for involuntary resettlement \nand  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples.  Three  draft  resettlement  plans  were  prepared  in \nconsultation with affected persons in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \nand disclosed. The project requires minor land acquisition for construction of sanitary landfills \nand temporary impacts on vendors during construction, with no significant resettlement impacts \nanticipated. Special assistance measures will be made available to vulnerable groups. The \nresettlement plans will be implemented by the PIUs and monitored by the PCO, and adequate \nconsultant  inputs  will  be  made  available  to  support  implementation  and  build  capacity  to \nmanaging  resettlement  impacts  and  social  risks.  Considering  the  urban  locations  of  these \nsubprojects, no impacts to indigenous peoples are expected. The draft resettlement framework \nwas prepared to address small components, which will be defined through detailed design, \nfollowing approval by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \nF.
