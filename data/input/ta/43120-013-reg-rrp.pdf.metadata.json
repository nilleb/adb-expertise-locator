I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan to the Kingdom of Cambodia; (ii) a proposed loan to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \n(Lao PDR), and (iii) a proposed grant to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), all \nfor the Trade Facilitation: Improved  Sanitary and Phytosanitary  (SPS) Handling in Greater \nMekong  Subregion  (GMS)  Trade  Project.  The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical \nassistance (TA) for Improving SPS Handling in Greater Mekong Subregion Trade, and if the \nBoard approves the loans and grant, I acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, \nwill approve the TA.1 \n \n2.  The project will strengthen institutions and operational and management capacities in \nCambodia and the Lao PDR for operating cost-effective SPS systems that facilitate trade and \nprotect health.2 The project will focus on GMS trade in agriculture, food, and forestry (AFF) \nproducts for which SPS measures for plant health, animal health, and food safety apply. The \nproject will establish, strengthen, and implement (i) surveillance and inspection programs for \nplant  health,  animal  health,  and food  safety; (ii)  enhanced  education levels  and  university \ntraining of SPS specialists; and (iii) regional cooperation and harmonization for SPS measures \nand  practices.  It  will  selectively  strengthen  food  safety  capacities  of  private  food  handling \nenterprises and restaurants in tourist areas. The project will be implemented by the national \nauthorities in each country. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The  GMS  regional  cooperation  strategy  and  program  focuses  on  connectivity  and \ncompetitiveness.  While  recent  investments  in  physical  infrastructure  have  created  new \nopportunities for trade, GMS governments increasingly realize that weak legal, institutional, and \nadministrative capacities hinder the optimal use of infrastructure and are insufficient to address \ntrade-related health hazards. A number of initiatives have been launched to overcome such \nconstraints, including the GMS cross-border transport agreement. The midterm review of the \n10-year (2002\u20132012) GMS strategic framework reaffirmed the importance of trade and transport \nfacilitation initiatives, including strengthened SPS capacity and cooperation. The essential SPS \nissues that need to be resolved to meet the development needs of the GMS were identified and \na GMS action plan for SPS arrangements, 2010\u20132015 was formulated.  \n \n4.  Trade in AFF products among GMS countries amounted to $9.27 billion in 2009. This \nconstituted about 13% of intra-GMS trade. Total GMS AFF exports grew more than fourfold \nfrom 2000 to 2009. Nevertheless, because of poor SPS management capacities, market access \nfor a wide range of AFF products from Cambodia and the Lao PDR remains limited, both in the \nGMS and globally. The governments of Cambodia and the Lao PDR have not been able to \nprotect their crops, livestock, and consumers against trade-related health hazards caused by \nplant pests, animal diseases, and food safety hazards. It is expected that, with better SPS \nsystems in place, trade of AFF products from Cambodia and the Lao PDR will increase by about \n10%\u201315% annually. Better SPS systems will also lead to reduced risk of crop, animal products \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB approved the concept note for the project and provided project preparatory TA in 2010. The Viet Nam project \nis under processing and may form part of the regional project under separate approval. SPS measures and issues \nare defined in the 1994 World Trade Organization Subsidiary Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and \nPhytosanitary Measures. \n ", "2 \n \nlosses, and reduced incidence of food-borne diseases. Effective national SPS management \nsystems are building blocks for regional harmonization and for establishing trust among GMS \ncountries in each other\u2019s SPS measures.3 \n \n5.  There is lack of human resource capacity to (i) undertake surveys on crop pests and \ndiseases,  (ii)  manage  inspections  and  interceptions  of  imported  products,  (iii)  monitor  the \nagricultural pesticide trade, (iv) understand the risks of forest pest spread associated with trade \nin wood and forest products, and (v) sustain and expand the regional trade in crop products. \nThere is also a need to (i) contain transboundary animal diseases, (ii) improve surveillance of \nveterinary drugs and feed, (iii) maintain animal food product safety, and (iv) improve border \nclearance  procedures.  Information  on  food  safety  is  scarce,  characterized  by  inadequate \nmonitoring of food, food establishments and food poisoning outbreaks. Although tourism in \nCambodia and the Lao PDR is rapidly growing, it is vulnerable without adequate food safety \nsupervision.  \n \n6.  Compliance with global SPS requirements requires national specialists to undertake \ntasks related to surveillance, risk analysis, testing, diagnostics, pest identification, standards, \nand conformity assessment. Trading partners and private companies often require application of \ngood agricultural practices, good manufacturing practices, and quality assurance management \n(such as hazard analysis critical control points). Cambodia and the Lao PDR lack specialists \nwho can perform these tasks. These specialists need to come (in part at least) from graduates \nof national higher education systems that train SPS specialists. Strengthening capacities of SPS \nagencies  is  urgently  needed  to  meet  the  increasing  requirements  for  exports  and  trade \nfacilitation, and to protect health. \n \n7.  Policy and sector relevance. The project is in line with the GMS 10-year strategic \nframework, 2012\u20132022 and supports the thrust to facilitate cross-border trade and investment.\n \nThe project will contribute to pillar 4 (cooperation in regional public goods) of ADB\u2019s Regional \nCooperation and Integration Strategy.4 The project is aligned with the targets of the National \nStrategic Development Plan Update, 2009\u20132013 of Cambodia and the National Socio Economic \nDevelopment Plan VII, 2011\u20132015 of the Lao PDR. Improving SPS management is explicitly \nreflected in various Cambodia and Lao PDR sector strategies and plans, and in the GMS core \nagriculture support program.\n \n \n8.  Lessons from trade facilitation and sanitary and phytosanitary development. Trade \nfacilitation remains a challenging agenda in the GMS. Previous experience shows the need to \nadopt  a  phased  approach  to  formulate  well-targeted  and  sequenced  projects  to  ensure \nimplementation  of  bilateral  and  regional  commitments  on  cooperation  and  harmonization. \nInadequate  capacities  at  the  country  level  are  major  constraints  for  effective  regional \ncooperation in SPS arrangements. Development partners, such as the United Nations agencies, \nthe World Bank and bilateral agencies support various aspects of SPS capacity building in the \nGMS,  but  ongoing  projects  have  not  addressed  SPS  issues  in  a  comprehensive  manner. \nPreparatory work has been firmly anchored in the lessons of international experiences that \nstress the need for prevention rather than end-of-pipe controls, which have proven to be costly \nand frequently ineffective. Involvement of the private sector and civil society in SPS capacity \nbuilding is necessary to ensure the right technical issues and challenges are addressed and for \nlonger-term  sustainability.  During  the  project  preparation  phase,  workshops  to  consult  the \n                                                \n3 Implementation progress of the proposed loans, grant, and TA will be reported to the cross-border transport   \nagreement subcommittee on health. \n4  Asian  Development  Bank.  2006.

Likewise, coordination with the GMS working group on agriculture has \nbeen maintained. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.   The impact will be Cambodia and Lao PDR AFF products that are safer, more efficiently \nproduced, and traded in greater quantities. The outcome will be an enhanced SPS management \nsystem in Cambodia and the Lao PDR, which will contribute to intraregional trade, export \ncompetitiveness, and health protection.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n  1.    Output 1: Strengthened Surveillance and Inspection Programs \n \n10.  Plant  health.  Investments  will  focus  on  (i)  conducting  systematic  surveillance  and \ngathering and managing survey-based data; (ii) strengthening diagnostic and analytical services \nthrough technical regulations and investments in laboratory facilities, equipment, supplies, and \nhuman resources; (iii) improving international reporting of pest situations; (iv) conducting forest \npest analysis to enable better understanding and management of forest health and associated \nSPS  compliance;  (v)  introducing  risk-based  approaches  to  plant  imports;  and  (vi)  in  the \nLao PDR, strengthening the supply chains associated with crop products (initially corn, followed \nby rice) for growing regional markets, especially the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).   \n \n11.  Animal health. The focus will be on strengthening surveillance programs by improving \ntesting, diagnostic, and response capacity for priority transboundary animal diseases (foot and \nmouth  disease, classical  swine  fever,  and  in Cambodia  also  hemorrhagic  septicemia,  and \nporcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome) with field implementation on a geographically \ntargeted basis (i.e., border or livestock production provinces). In the Lao PDR, monitoring the \nsafety of veterinary drugs, animal feeds, and animal products will be enhanced. In Cambodia, \ncapacity to monitor veterinary drug residues will be supported. In both Cambodia and the Lao \nPDR, the project will promote risk-based import controls. 5 \n \n12.  Food safety. The focus will be on (i) designing and implementing annual programs of \nsurveillance, monitoring, and inspection based on known and perceived risks of food safety \nhazards in specific products, locations, markets, hotels, and restaurants; and (ii) on hazard \nresponse capacity, which will include selectively strengthening laboratory capacities. The project \nwill pursue improved food safety handling in the tourist industry by promoting good hygiene \npractices, good manufacturing practices, and enterprise grading. Once grading systems have \nbeen established, these services can be delivered by private providers. The project will support \nnational studies on the possibilities for Cambodia and the Lao PDR to use assessments by \nother GMS countries for first-time market access requests for processed food products.6  Risk-\nbased methods and updated manuals and procedures for controlling imported processed food \nin line with international recommendations and those of the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations (ASEAN) will also be introduced.  \n \n                                                \n5  Implementation will focus on provinces with international border posts and high levels of transit activity. \n6  Followed by regional consultations to adopt a system for sharing information on first-time access assessments. \n \n ", "4 \n \n    2.     Output 2: Improved Regional Cooperation and Harmonization \n \n13.  The project will support Cambodia and the Lao PDR\u2019s active participation in regional fora \nsuch as the Southeast Asia and China Foot and Mouth Disease project; International Food \nSafety  Authorities  Network;  ASEAN  Rapid  Alert  System for  Food  and  Feed;  and twinning \narrangements between Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and other countries on SPS issues. The \nproject  will  support  SPS  regional  cooperation  and  harmonization  through  bilateral  working \ngroups (including the PRC and Thailand) in the areas of plant health, animal health, and food \nsafety.7 It will support the participation of respective national participants in the working groups \nand promote consultation on import handling.  \n \n 3.     Output 3: Enhanced Education Levels and University Training of Sanitary \nand Phytosanitary Specialists \n  \n14.  The project will focus on upgrading academic education for SPS specialists by improving \nthe quality of teaching at the Royal University of Agriculture (Cambodia) and the Faculty of \nAgriculture at the National University of Laos (with some participation by the University of Health \nSciences). This will cover (i) curricula development, (ii) teaching quality improvement, and (iii) \nlaboratory and teaching facilities upgrading. Where appropriate, the project will promote the use \nof government officials as guest lecturers.  \n   \n   4.    Output 4: Effective Project Management  \n  \n15.  Project  management  and  support  services  will  focus  on  establishing  project \nmanagement  units  (PMUs)  with  support  from  international  and  national  experts  for  SPS \ntechnical issues and for financial management and procurement. Component implementation \nunits will be set up for compiling initial work plans and budgets from respective departments in \nCambodia and the Lao PDR, and for day-to-day liaison on operational matters. PMUs will also \nfacilitate engagement of the private sector and other stakeholders in project activities. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n16.

The TA will be implemented from August 2012 to August 2017. It is estimated to cost \n$750,000 and will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF-IV). The TA will support 10 person-months of international and 30 person-months of \nnational  consultants\u2019  input,  with  expertise  in  project  management  and  SPS  issues.  The \nconsultants will be engaged on an individual basis to enable fast deployment and flexibility to \nundertake TA work. Short-term resource persons will be engaged to support regional meetings \nand training as needed. The activities of the consultants are not interdependent and the timing \nwill be staggered because of the complexity of the project. All consultants and resource persons \nwill be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as \namended from time to time). ADB will be the executing agency and will work closely with \nagencies responsible for SPS measures and coordinating agencies in Cambodia, Lao PDR and \nViet  Nam.  Disbursement  under  the  TA  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical  \n \n23.  A particular feature of project technical design has been to focus responsibility for the \ncomponents dealing with plant health, animal health, food safety, and academic education for \nSPS  capacity development firmly on the individual institutions in each country. Despite the \ninstitutional breadth within each component, technical interventions are broadly similar as they \nfocus on strengthening surveillance and inspection systems and upgrading human resources, \ninvolving the provision of a range of technical expertise, training, workshops, and hardware to \nachieve this purpose. \n \n24.  The major technical design parameters are (i) a recognition that plant, animal, and food \nsafety surveillance systems start from a low informational and human capacity base, and that \nenhancing SPS capacity should take a pragmatic and practical approach; (ii) promoting simple \nand cost-effective approaches where possible (e.g., use of rapid test kits, construction of shared \nlaboratory facilities); and (iii) an emphasis on strengthening university teaching as opposed to \nresearch. The project has been designed to complement ongoing and planned interventions by \nvarious  development  partners  and  ADB.  Subregional  cooperation  is  promoted  through \nparticipation in regional SPS fora, bilateral working groups, training attachments, academic \nexchanges, twinning, etc.  \n \n ", "8 \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n25.  The economic rationale for the project rests largely on the \u2015public goods nature\u2016 of the \ngoods and services to be provided. Without intervention, the operation of SPS systems and \nmany services, in the GMS will be suboptimum. This is especially the case where \u2015weaker\u2016 or \n\u2015weakest link technology\u2016 is involved and where the poorer member countries (Cambodia and \nthe Lao PDR) lack the capacity to meet relevant international and regional standards for health \nand trade.9  \n \n26.  Although  institutional  strengthening  of  SPS  systems  does  not  easily  lend  itself  to \nquantification of economic impacts, benefits to each country are estimated to be  $5 million\u2013\n$10 million annually. Without the project, (i) the majority of Cambodia and Lao PDR AFF trade \nwould  remain  relatively  small-scale,  informal,  and  therefore  unrecorded,  unregulated,  and \nuntaxed.  With  limited  incentives  for  improving  quality  and  safety\u2014trade  would  remain \nunprocessed,  not  suitable  for  value-adding  processes,  and  destined  to  low-end  markets; \n(ii) specific AFF export opportunities (like rice, corn, fruit, and vegetables to the PRC and to \nhigh-end markets) would be lost; (iii) Cambodia and the Lao PDR would be at greater risk from \nvarious forms of pest invasions, transboundary animal disease outbreaks, and food safety risks \nfor  consumers,  with  consequent  wider  reputational  implications  for  the  GMS,  especially  in \ntourism; and (iv) Cambodia and the Lao PDR might become destinations for some substandard \nand potentially dangerous agricultural inputs and consumer products in the GMS.  \n \n27.  The financial sustainability of the project is particularly important since SPS systems rely \non recurrent funding to maintain surveillance and testing systems, and opportunities for cost \nrecovery from the private sector are limited.10 Recurrent costs of survey and other operations \nare relatively high (about 20% of total project costs in both Cambodia and the Lao PDR). The \nfiscal implications have been discussed with the respective governments, which acknowledge \nand accept the recurrent cost implications. \n \nC.  Governance  \n28.  All procurement to be financed by ADB loan and grant funds will be carried out in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Project \nimplementation, procurement, and financial management will be aligned with the governments\u2019 \nstandard  operating  procedures.  The  project  accounts  administered  by  the  PMUs  will  be \nconsolidated and audited annually by auditors acceptable to ADB. The project will strengthen \ncapacities  of  staff  in  financial  management  procedures  to  allow  the  efficient  operation  of \nadvance accounts and reporting of financial performance to the governments and ADB. The \nproject will establish or use existing ministerial websites to (i) disclose implementation progress \nand bid notifications and their results, and (ii) provide a grievance mechanism against any \ncorrupt practice. \n \n                                                \n9 Animal disease control and plant pest and disease management across long and porous borders are classic    \nexamples of where subregional performance can be determined by weaker members\u2019 capacities because of \ntransboundary spillover effects. \n10  The potential for cost recovery through the charging of fees for services (e.g., testing of feeds, pesticides, food) is     \nlimited in both countries because of the modest size and sophistication of the private sector and the absence of \nregulatory-driven compliance incentives. \n \n ", "9 \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  governments.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the project administration manuals.11 \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n30.  The  project  is  classified  general  intervention  and  does  not  target  poverty  directly. \nHowever, by improving the SPS handling of AFF products in trade, the project will contribute to \nagricultural productivity and help make AFF trade more predictable, transparent, and with lower \ntransaction costs. While there may be some adjustment costs to certain producers, the project \nwill strengthen AFF value chains within and between GMS countries\u2014extending back to the on-\nfarm production environment. This will (i) create demand for on-farm and off-farm labor and \nprimary AFF produce (i.e., agriculture and livestock products), and (ii) support incomes and \ngainful employment of poor rural households.12 \n31.  As women dominate agricultural employment in Cambodia and the Lao PDR13 and their \nparticipation in tourist-related employment is high, they will particularly benefit from project \ninvestments. The project is categorized as having some gender benefits. Gender analyses have \nbeen undertaken and selected gender targets (women\u2019s participation in training) have been \nidentified and reflected in the legal agreements and the design and monitoring framework.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n32.  The  project  is  classified  category  C  for  impacts  on  the  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \n33.  The project does not have a negative environmental impact and no implications for \nresettlement of any persons: (i) civil works are all small-scale and are on existing university \nsites, (ii) no construction activities will take place at border sites, and (iii) all systems upgrading \ntakes place within existing facilities and premises. \n \nF.

Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4.14 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLack of sustainability of project  Awareness raising among policy makers about importance of operational \nachievements because of insufficient  funding for using and maintaining laboratory and surveillance capacities \ngovernment budget for recurrent cost \nEstablishment of annual work programs with clear (recurrent) budget \nand system maintenance \nrequirements \nGovernment assurances reflected in loan and financing agreements \nWeak staff capacities (quantity and  Consultants will provide technical expertise and formal and on-the-job \nquality) to conduct technical project  training activities in all subcomponents \nactivities (including at provincial level) \nConsultants will assist technical agencies to conduct specialized tasks \n                                                \n11  Project Administration Manuals (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n12  Poverty is now largely a rural phenomenon in Cambodia and the Lao PDR. \n13  Women account for over 50% of those engaged in agriculture in the Lao PDR. \n14  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "10 \n \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nWeak institutional and staff capacities  Training of government staff is provided for project management and \nto implement the project in compliance  implementation (financial administration, financial management, monitoring \nwith ADB requirements for project  and evaluation, and procurement)  \nadministration, financial management, \nConsultants are recruited to support government staff in project \nand procurement \nmanagement, financial management, and procurement \nADB = Asian Development Bank.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES  \n35.  The governments have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the project \nadministration manuals and loan and grant documents. \n   \n36.
