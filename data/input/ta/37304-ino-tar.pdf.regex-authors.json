In 2000, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved regional technical assistance \n(RETA) to enhance national resettlement policies and build capacity in six developing member \ncountries, including Indonesia .1 In 2002, the RETA, with Badan Pertanahan Nasional (National \nLand Agency or BPN) as the Indonesian focal agency, delivered (i) a draft land acquisition act, \nwhich BPN was to develop further following stakeholder consultation and then submit to the \nParliament for deliberations and approval; and (ii) a set of recommendations to facilitate the \nimplementation  of  the  new  act,  including  the  need  to  prepare  implementing  rules  and \nregulations, mainstreamed processing mechanisms for local governments, and capacity building \ninitiatives.  \n \n2.  Based on the results of the RETA, ADB\u2019s 2002 Country Programming Mission confirmed \nthe  funding  for  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  facilitate  the  establishment  of  a  legal  and \nadministrative framework for land acquisition and resettlement, which would address some of \nthe final recommendations of the RETA. The Government of Indonesia agreed to include the \nproposed TA in ADB\u2019s 2004 country program for Indonesia. Initial consultations were carried out \nwith BPN in the same year, followed by a preliminary TA Fact-Finding Mission in March 2005. A \ndraft memorandum of understanding was prepared and extensively discussed. However, the \nsigning was postponed, because the Government was preparing a new perpres (presidential \ndecree) on land acquisition (perpres 36/2005) instead of the proposed land acquisition act. In \nJune 2005, ADB held additional discussions with the Government to update the TA proposal in \naccordance with the introduction of perpres 36/2005. BPN indicated that, although the legal \nframework had been improved with the issuance of the new decree, it would still welcome \nmodified TA. In response to issues and concerns raised by civil society, perpres 36/2005 was \namended by perpres 65/2006 in June 2006. The new decree differs from the previous one in \ntwo main aspects. First, the 2006 decree provides for land assessment by an independent \nappraiser\u2014although  it  does  not  address  how  the  appraiser  would  be  selected  and  what \nvaluation methodology would be used\u2014and would not guarantee replacement cost. However, \nthe  most  important  and  controversial  change  is  the  clear  provision  for  expropriation  if \nnegotiations are not concluded after 90 days, although the perpres is not clear on how this \nwould be implemented.2 No further actions were taken or decisions made on the TA until follow-\nup fact-finding missions 3\u20137 July 2006 and 10\u201313 October 2006. During the final TA Fact-\nFinding  Mission  (21  February\u20132  March  2007),  the  BPN  requested  the  proposed  TA  for \npreparing a land law and related implementing regulations, which the Government identified as \na priority, and signed a memorandum of understanding to this effect in October 2007. BPN \nadvised ADB that Indonesia does not have the capacity to prepare the land law on its own. ADB \nand  the  Government  agreed  that  the  proposed  land  law  will  include  a  chapter  on  land \nacquisition and resettlement, and will meet international standards. This paper was prepared \nbased on the final Fact-Finding Mission and additional discussions with the Government that \nfollowed. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES   \n \n3.  Indonesian Legal Context for a Land Law. Since 2001, the Government of Indonesia \nand Indonesian Parliament, through ketetapan (parliamentary decree) and perpres 34/2003, \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance for National Resettlement Policy Enhancement and Capacity Building. Manila.  \n2  This is consistent with the Law on Expropriation (Pencabutan Hak-Hak Tanah Dan Benda-Benda Yang Ada \nDiatasnya) No. 20/1961, which has been invoked only once. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 14 June 2007. \n ", "2   \ninstructed BPN to prepare a draft agrarian resource law to replace or modify the Undang-\nUndang Pokpo Agraria (Basic Agrarian Law 5/1960 or UUPA). However, public consultation and \nGovernment interdepartmental discussions led to the decision not to replace or modify the \nUUPA. The main objective of UUPA is to provide the foundation and details for (i) drafting other \nnational agrarian-related laws, (ii) integrating and simplifying land law, and (iii) ensuring land \nrights for all Indonesian people. These were the guidelines to BPN for drafting the land law, \nwithin the framework of the already-establish agrarian law.  The land law should be prepared in \na  comprehensive  manner  to  accommodate  and  manage  all  land-related  issues,  and  may \nintersect with other sectoral laws established under the UUPA.  \u00a0\n \n4.  The UUPA discusses issues generally covered under land law, such as (i) land tenure, \n(ii) rights to land, and (iii) land registration. It also stipulates that rights to land may be revoked \nfor public interest by providing adequate compensation. Further, UUPA states that the matter \nwill be regulated through law, which was the basis for the formulation of perpres 36/2005 and \n65/2006. It recognizes and protects rights acquired under customary and other laws that existed \nbefore promulgation of the UUPA. The proposed land law would support the provisions of the \nUUPA. It would be a subsystem of UUPA, in the same manner as the Agricultural Law (1961), \nthe Foreign Investment Law (1967), the Mining Law (1967), the Forestry Law (1999), and the \nWater Resources Law (2004). These laws support the umbrella UUPA of 1960.    \n \n5.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Issues. During the infrastructure summit held in \nJakarta  in  January  2005,  the  minister  of  finance  and  Badan  Perencanaan  Pembangunan \nNasional  (National  Planning  and  Development  Agency  or  BAPPENAS)  noted  that  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  remains  one  of  the  main  causes  of  delays  in  project \nimplementation  and  disbursement.  This  position  was  echoed  by  representatives  of  other \nGovernment agencies attending the summit, and is confirmed by the records of ADB, World \nBank, and other development partners. Based on the results of the RETA (footnote 1), and on \nGovernment and ADB experience, this appears to be caused by (i) lack of an updated legal \nframework  guaranteeing  equitable  and  rapid  involuntary  resettlement  (IR),  (ii)  absence  of \ncomprehensive IR implementing regulations, and (iii) inadequate capacity for IR tasks.  \n \n6.  Indonesian  Legal  Framework  for  Immovable  Property  Rights,  Including  Land \nAcquisition and Resettlement. The national legal framework covering IR matters has been \nstrengthened  since  May  2005.4 Perpres  36/2005  and  perpres  65/2006,  as  well  as  BPN \nregulations  on  implementing  perpres  36/2005  and  perpres  65/2006,  were  significant \nimprovements. However, they fall short of ensuring compensation, resettlement, and livelihood \nrestoration for all impacts caused by a project. The overall policy objective of these decrees and \nregulations is compensation alone to restore or improve social and economic conditions, and \nonly for people with land titles, or traditional or customary rights. \n \n7.  The absence in the national IR legislation of broad and mainstreamed implementing \nregulations for IR, together with insufficient impact assessment capacity of local governments, \nresults in unsystematic IR planning procedures, preparation, financing, and implementation at \nthe local level. Ultimately, this delays project implementation significantly. The lack of any legal \nprovision for informal dwellers, and only ad hoc provision of nominal and inadequate assistance \nto informal dwellers by district governments, also results in long delays in reaching agreements \non development partner-financed projects that require restoration for all affected people. The \n                                                 \n4  Perpres 36/2005 of 3 May 2005: Provision of Land for Realizing the Development for Public Interests; perpres \n65/2006 of 5 June 2006: Revision to Perpres 36/2005 on Land Acquisition for Public Purposes; BPN regulation \n3/2007 of 13 June 2007: Land Acquisition Implementation Guideline of Perpres 65/2006 and Perpres 36/2005. \n ", "  3\nchallenge of IR in Indonesia is a significant constraint to promoting investment in infrastructure, \nwith toll roads being one of the most difficult areas. \n \n8.  Perpres 36/2005, as amended by perpres 65/2006, and BPN regulation 3/2007 will \nserve as the interim legal framework for IR until the proposed land law is issued. The TA will \nsupport a review of perpres 36/2005 and 65/2006 and BPN regulation 3/2007 with the intention \nof  replacing  them  by  full  coverage  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  provisions  in  the \nproposed land law.  The TA is designed to support the Government-driven drafting of the land \nlaw. However, while IR is ADB\u2019s primary concern in the proposed law, the proposed law is \nintended to enhance immovable property rights generally for all people in Indonesia.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.   The main impact of the TA will be  improved legal and administrative framework for land, \nincluding IR, fully supported by BPN. The outcome of the TA will be  Improved awareness and \nimplementation of land rights and IR in keeping with international best practice.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA will have three components, implemented as follows:  \n \n(i)  Diagnostic assessment. The TA will begin with an analysis of the current land-\nrelated legal framework, processes, systems, and administrative arrangements in \neach province. It will examine the implementation practices and gaps, and the \nreasons  for  such  gaps  (such  as  structural  and  institutional).  It  will  make \nrecommendations for improvement and streamlining.  \n \n(ii)  Drafting the land law. Based on the diagnostic assessment, the TA will provide \nassistance to the Government for review and revision of the draft academic \npaper and drafting of the land law, consultation with relevant stakeholders in all \nregions, and revisions based on the review and consultation. The proposed land \nlaw should include comprehensive provisions for (a) redefinition of the state\u2019s \nrights on land, covering the state\u2019s rights over land and space and the state\u2019s \nmanagement  rights;  (b)  elaboration  of  immovable  property  rights,  covering \nregulations on establishment of land rights, compulsory appropriation of land \nrights or interests,5 rights and obligations over land, and rights of owners6 and \noccupants; (c) redefinition of land-related titles, covering title for apartment, title \nfor space below and above land, land title for adverse possession, customary \nrights for indigenous communities, riparian rights, and land title for coastal land \nareas; (d) Islamic law and inheritance, and women\u2019s rights over land and related \nresources and compensation; (e) standards and methods of cadastral survey, \nmeasurement, and mapping for land subdivision, land consolidation, land use \n                                                 \n5  The drafters will need to take into account the provisions of Undang-Undang 20/1961 tentang Pencabutan Hak-hak \ndi Atas Tanah dan Benda-benda yang Ada di Atasnya (Law 10/1961 on Revocation of Land Rights), a separate \nlaw to the UUPA. They will have to determine whether it is sufficiently specific or should be revised and included in \nthe draft land law. \n6  Indonesian law recognizes four major types of title: (i) freehold title, (ii) cultivation right title, (iii) building use title, \nand (iv) right to use title. \n ", "4   \nand management, and land management for special areas; (f) land registration \nsystem; (g) approval and custody of survey plan and land valuation: (h) land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  for  public7 and  private  purpose;  and  (i)  land \nmonitoring. The drafting process will be designed and undertaken to develop the \ndrafting skills of BPN. \n \n(iii)  Consultation  with  central  and  local  governments  and  civil  society.  To \nensure the mainstreaming of TA outputs, and to obtain the endorsement of the \nproposed law by central and local governments and the support of civil society \norganizations, the TA will include financing for an intensive consultation process. \nConsultation will be carried out at central Government level through two national \nworkshops in Jakarta. At the regional level, consultations will be carried out \nthrough four regional workshops8 and smaller meetings, involving representatives \nfrom  local  governments,  civil  society  organizations,  and  the  public.  The \nconsultation process will be designed and undertaken to develop consultation \nskills within BPN. \n  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost the equivalent of $625,000. ADB will provide a grant for the \nequivalent of $500,000 from its TA funding program, which will cover (i) remuneration, per \ndiems, and travel of international and national consultants; (ii) consultation on the draft land law; \n(iii)  legal  review;  (iv)  workshop  organization,  including  catering  and  participants\u2019  per  diem, \ntransport,  board  and  lodging,  and  facilitation;  (v)  support  staff;  (vi)  office  equipment;  (vii) \npublications, report writing, and translation costs; and (viii) miscellaneous office administration \ncosts.  The  Government  will  provide  the  equivalent  of  $125,000  to  cover  counterpart  staff \nsalaries,  furnished  project  office  space,  and  a  workshop  venue  when  held  at  BPN.  Cost \nestimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  BPN will be the Executing Agency (EA). A legal and technical working group, under the \nleadership of BPN, will include the following line agencies: BAPPENAS, Ministry of Finance, \nMinistry  of  Home  Affairs,  Ministry  of  Justice,  Ministry  of  Public  Works,  State  Minister  for \nWomen\u2019s Empowerment, Ministry of Religion, and the State Secretariat. The working group will \nsupervise the TA activities, periodically meet to discuss progress in TA tasks, and review the \ndocuments  produced.  BPN\u2019s  legal  department  will  establish  a  counterpart  team,  including \nprofessional staff with extensive expertise on the TA subject matter, and will keep close contact \nwith local governments. At the local government level, the TA team will rely on personnel to be \nprovided by local BPN offices. To ensure complementarity, the EA will facilitate coordination \nbetween the project and the World Bank-financed Land Management and Policy Development \nProject. Under the World Bank project, BPN\u2019s technical capacity is being strengthened and \nBAPPENAS is preparing a national land policy framework that will serve as BAPPENAS\u2019s road \n                                                 \n7  Perpres 65/2006 narrowed the list of investments considered as public interest, dropping schools, public health \nfacilities, and government offices. The TA will review, and consider the need for redefinition of, investment for \npublic purposes. \n8  Four regional workshops are planned for the following regions (i) Java Island, (ii) Sumatra and Kalimantan, (iii) Bali \nand Nugu-Tengaru, and (iv) Papua and Sulawesi and Malaki. \n ", "  5\nmap for all land-related legal instruments, although it will have no legal status.9 The framework \nhas been drafted through a participatory and consultative process that has been a capacity \nbuilding exercise for BAPPENAS. The TA will replicate this capacity building process within \nBPN. \n \n13.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months, tentatively from February 2008 to January \n2010. The tasks to be performed as part of the TA will require 45 person-months of consulting \nservices, comprising 10 person-months of international (land and property valuation, land policy, \nand IR specialists) and 35 person-months of national (full-time national land policy specialist as \nteam leader, and specialists in property valuation, IR, gender, legal, and consultation). The \noutline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. The consultants will submit semiannual reports to \nthe EA project director and Infrastructure Division, Southeast Asia Department. ADB will select \nand engage a consulting firm in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, \nas amended from time to time), the quality- and cost-based selection method, and a simple \ntechnical proposal. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n14.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Indonesia for Enhancing the Legal and Administrative Framework for Land \nProject, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n9  The World Bank is providing a $2.9 million loan to the Government of Indonesia for the Land Management and \nPolicy Development Project. BPN is the EA as well as implementing agency for three technical components, \nincluding (i) institutional development, capacity building, and training for BPN;  (ii) implementation of an accelerated \nland titling program; and (iii) development of a land information system. BAPPENAS is the implementing agency for \nthe fourth component, which consists of development of a national land policy framework. The objective of the \nframework is to overcome three land-related issues: (i) land disputes and conflicts, (ii) inequity of land tenure and \nownership, and (iii) the weakness of legal data on land ownership. It is intended to support BAPPENAS in its \ncoordination function, by contributing to two schemes: (i) regulation scheme, of which the proposed land law will be \nthe first to be developed; and (ii) the investment scheme, from which results the 5-year and annual national \ndevelopment programs. The fifth component of the World Bank project is providing technical assistance to the \nMinistry of Home Affairs for capacity building support for local government to undertake land administration and \nmanagement functions.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n    Data   \n  Performance  Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nDesign Summary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved legal and  More equitable,  \u2022  Documents  The Government is \nadministrative  efficient, and  prepared by  committed to an \nframework for land,  transparent land- consultants and  improved legal and \nincluding IR, fully  related activities  LTWG  administrative \nsupported by BPN   that protect the  \u2022  Workshop  framework for land \n  land rights of all  presentations  and for IR, in line with \n  Indonesian people  \u2022  Public  international best \n    comments on  practice. \ndraft land law   \nThe draft land law as \n\u2022  BTORs \nprepared under the TA \n\u2022  TA completion \nwill be issued and \nreport \nimplemented. \n \nRisk \nThe draft final land law \nis not supported by \nParliament. \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nImproved awareness  Fewer land-related  \u2022 Government  BPN and the LTWG \nand implementation of  conflicts  reports and  new  will take ownership \nland rights and IR in    legal instruments  and be effective in \nkeeping with  Improved IR plans    drafting the TA \ninternational best  and implementation  \u2022 Copies of RPs  documents, and will \npractice     and  IR monitoring  demonstrate \n  Improved land- and evaluation  commitment to \n  related legal   reports  achieving the TA \ninstruments    impact and outcome. \n   \nThe draft land law will \nbe supported by \nGovernment agencies, \nlocal governments, \ncivil society, in \nkeeping with \ninternational best \npractice. \n \nRisk \nPolitical atmosphere \nand interests in \nParliament could delay \ndrafting of the land \nlaw. \n ", "    Appendix 1  7 \n    Data   \n  Performance  Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nDesign Summary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nOutputs  \u2022 Draft final land  \u2022 Workshop reports,  Assumptions \n1.
