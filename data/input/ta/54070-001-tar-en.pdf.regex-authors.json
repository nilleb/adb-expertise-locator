INTRODUCTION \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will strengthen capacities for \ndesigning, negotiating, implementing, and monitoring free trade agreements (FTAs) involving the \nCentral Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) countries. The CAREC Strategy 2030 \nstipulates that the region will assess and respond to the shifting landscape of global and regional \ntrade paradigms and the potential of moving toward with FTAs in the region.1 The TA will support \nthe implementation of the CAREC Integrated Trade Agenda 2030 (CITA 2030), which includes \nenhancing the evidence base for decision-making regarding trade negotiations, capacity-building, \nand knowledge-sharing for the new generation of FTAs.2   \n2.  Continued interest on free trade agreements in the post-coronavirus disease era. \nCAREC countries have expressed keen interest to pursue FTAs as effective tools to boost the \nregion\u2019s economic growth and integration with the global economy.3 However, the regional \ncooperation and integration (RCI) index for CAREC (estimated at 0.351) is low compared with \nother regions in the Asia and the Pacific region which is 0.503 at average with maximum at 0.654 \nfor Southeast Asia.4 In 2019, the share of intra-subregional trade for Central Asia was only 3.3%, \ncompared with 35% in East Asia and 23% in Southeast Asia. There is ample scope for CAREC \ncountries to expand intra- and inter-regional trade, including through taking advantage of FTAs. \nThe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has further highlighted the necessity of regional \ncooperation  and  importance  of  strengthening  resilience  to  risks  arising  from  cross-border \nmovement of goods and people. Trade will continue to be a driver for achieving the sustainable \ndevelopment goals and CAREC countries\u2019 post-pandemic recovery. CAREC must therefore \ncontinue their efforts to keep trade open and smooth to revitalize globalization, deepen regional \ncooperation, and achieve sustainable growth.   \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Knowledge  and  capacity  deficits.  FTAs  can  be  key  drivers  of  stronger  trade \nrelationships among countries. By doing so, they support the development of the agricultural value \nchains, small and medium-sized enterprises, women-led businesses, and start-ups that often \nbenefit the world\u2019s poor and the less advantaged people.5 However, the FTA-associated gains \nare not automatic. Experience suggests that achieving the trade diversification and greater \nintegration that FTAs can deliver depends greatly on the breadth and depth of the agreement and \nthe extent to which the FTA commitments are implemented and enforced. In this connection, \nCAREC countries must build greater analytical and institutional capacities to develop a solid \nunderstanding, strategies, and best practices necessary to ensure maximum benefits from FTAs. \nEffective FTAs must also advance and not contradict the free trade principles of the World Trade \nOrganization (WTO). When properly designed, negotiated, implemented, and monitored, FTAs \ncan help liberalize global trade. Eight CAREC members are WTO members and three are at \nvarious stage of acceding to the WTO, while the majority of CAREC members are undertaking \n \n1  ADB. 2017.

A differentiated \napproach to accommodate the varying priorities and different stages of FTA development across \nthe region will ensure CAREC members benefit from knowledge and capacity-building initiatives \non FTAs.  \n4.  Uneven participation and limited geographic reach. To date, 20 FTAs have been \nconcluded with 4 more FTAs and 2 preferential trade agreements being negotiated amongst \nCAREC member countries.6 Most FTAs are bilateral and do not have the breadth and depth as \nthose  in  ASEAN  or  European  Union  agreements.  Few  multilateral  FTAs  such  as  the \nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) FTA \ninclude selected CAREC countries. However, despite the rising numbers of FTAs involving \nCAREC members, participation is uneven across the region. FTA activity has grown in Georgia, \nPakistan, Kazakhstan, and the People\u2019s Republic of China. Meanwhile, the remaining CAREC \ncountries have at least one FTA, most are bilateral preferential arrangements with their neighbors, \nwith limited scope and coverage, and merely eliminating tariffs on trade in agricultural and \nmanufacturing goods. Few can be considered new-generation FTAs that cover WTO-Plus and \nWTO-X provisions, including trade in services, investment, trade facilitation, competition policy, \ndigital trade, e-commerce, intellectual property rights, and labor and environmental protection.7 \n5.  The complexity of regional FTAs. CAREC countries expressed interests to explore \npotential regional FTA among three or more countries on a voluntary basis.8 They have resolved \nto  \u201ctravel  the  last  mile\u201d  by  exploring  a  potential  CAREC-wide  FTA.  This  will  require  a \ncomprehensive  understanding  of  the  dynamics,  complex  processes,  and  institutional  and \nstructural changes involved. There are important politically sensitive considerations, as some \nCAREC  countries  are  already  members  of  the  EAEU,  while  other  CAREC  countries  may \npotentially also seek to join. These geopolitical considerations may generate complex and \nsensitive  impacts  amongst  the  CAREC  countries,  which  require  careful  management.  A \nregionwide FTA could deliver greater economic integration for their member countries. Ideally, \nsuch an FTA should cover both trade in goods and services, and promote greater integration \nwithin the CAREC region.9 Similarly, a CAREC FTA must not raise barriers to trade between WTO \nparties and individual FTA members, and complement rather than act as a substitute for the global \nmultilateral trading system. \n6.  Strategic fit. The CAREC 2030 strategy recognizes the role that FTAs can play in creating \nan open and inclusive regional cooperation platform that connects people, policies, and projects \nin Central Asia for shared and sustainable development (footnote 1). CAREC Regional Trade \nGroup (RTG), a leading consultative and coordinating body with full operational authority over \nCAREC work on trade, has been mandated to carry out initiatives to develop a potential CAREC-\nwide FTA as embodied in CITA 2030. The TA will support these initiatives and is aligned with \n \n6  ADB. Asia Regional Integration Center Database. Update as of 19 August 2020. Preferential trade agreements \nprovide preferential (low or lower than other countries) tariffs and may be free trade agreements (zero tariffs between \nparties) or customs unions with common external tariffs. \n7  WTO-Plus refers to policy areas under the WTO mandate: customs regulations, technical barriers to trade, sanitary \nand phytosanitary standards, and trade in services. WTO-X refers to policy areas not covered in WTO agreements: \ninvestment measures, intellectual property rights, and competition policy. UNESCAP. 2019.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: (i) global and regional trade and investment \nopportunities expanded, and (ii) integration of CAREC countries in the regional and global \neconomies enhanced.11 The TA will have the following outcome: CAREC countries\u2019 capacities for \ndesigning, negotiating, implementing, and monitoring of FTAs improved.12 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n8.  Output 1: Evidence-based policy recommendations generated and action plans \ndeveloped. The TA will distill international best practices on FTAs that are relevant to CAREC \nand support the development of action plans for CAREC to effectively formulate or improve FTAs. \nThe TA will review the conceptual foundations for FTAs, take stock of FTAs involving CAREC \ncountries, assess the evidence on their impacts, and make policy recommendations. The TA will \ndraw on lessons from within the CAREC region and beyond to identify the best practices in \ndesigning, negotiating, implementing, and monitoring FTAs. These, in turn, will feed into the \ntraining and capacity-building under the TA (output 2). The TA will also support deep dive of key \nissues that are relevant to establishing a FTA among CAREC countries, such as trade in goods \nand  services,  investment,  economic  and  technical  cooperation,  intellectual  property,  and \ncompetition  policy.  Corresponding  FTA-related  action  plans  will  be  developed  for  selected \nCAREC countries.13 The findings will be shared at a regional workshop; published in a single \nvolume or as separate papers; and disseminated through blogs, op-ed pieces, and contributions \nto ADB\u2019s corporate publications. \n9.  Output 2: Capacity of CAREC member countries to design, negotiate, implement, \nand monitor FTAs improved. The TA will support capacity building for the crucial skill sets and \ntechnical knowledge through three initiatives: (i) national workshops in select CAREC countries; \n(ii) regional events where countries comparatively more advanced in the implementation of FTAs \nwill share their lessons and best practices; and (iii) regional training of trainers on how to design, \nnegotiate, and implement FTAs. The innovative and effective modes of delivery, including virtual \nonline modules and live clinics will be explored. Examples from CAREC countries as well as other \nregions will be used to illustrate key principles and concepts. Capacity building will target mid-\nlevel officials in relevant ministries, while knowledge dissemination will involve senior officials. \nGiven the diverse range of FTA-related competencies across CAREC countries and emerging \nneeds and priorities, targeted hands-on capacity building support to relevant government officials \nwill be provided. \n \n10 ADB. 2019.

Output 3: Roadmap for a CAREC FTA developed. In line with the objectives of CITA \n2030, the desirability, feasibility, readiness, and related institutional arrangements required to \npursue a CAREC FTA will be explored and examined.14 Consultations with governments and \nother stakeholders will be organized, findings disseminated, and recommendations for ways \nforward proposed. Key policy and institutional measures to design and implement a proposed \nregional FTA for CAREC countries will be identified. Building on these, the TA will prepare a \nroadmap to establish a CAREC wide FTA to deepen and expand the trade relationships among \nthe member countries.   \n11.  The TA will build on the work completed under earlier ADB TAs.15 Experience from \nprevious ADB TAs highlights the importance of providing support that is both comprehensive and \nresponsive to individual country needs. This lesson is reflected in the design of the TA. The TA \nwill promote an open and inclusive regional cooperation platform and maintain high degree of \nflexibility to accommodate the priorities and different stages of FTA development on various \nCAREC countries.16  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.2 million, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Poverty Reduction and Regional Cooperation Fund \n(PRCF), and $700,000 will be financed on a grant basis from the United Kingdom Fund for Asia \nRegional Trade and Connectivity under the Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing \nPartnership Facility (ARTCF), both administered by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 2.  The ARTCF will finance consulting services, training events, conferences, and \nworkshops. The participating CAREC governments will provide counterpart support in the form of \ncounterpart staff, office premises, office supplies, secretarial assistance, domestic transportation, \nand other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB will administer the TA as the executing agency. ADB\u2019s East Asia Department (EARD) \nwill be the implementing agency. The Public Management, Financial Sector, and Regional \nCooperation Division will serve as the principal focal point for the TA administration, working \nclosely with the CAREC unit of ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department, the resident missions \nin the CAREC countries, and ADB\u2019s Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department \nand Regional Cooperation and Integration Thematic Group. ADB will be coordinated with (i) \nCAREC RTG and regional TA projects; (ii) ongoing research and capacity-building activities being \nundertaken by the CAREC Institute, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, \nand the Regional Knowledge Sharing Initiative; and (iii) the research and capacity-building \nactivities of other development partners such as the WTO, the World Customs Organization, and \nthe United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific.17 ADB will follow \n \n14 ADB. 2019.
