Justification \n \n1.  Alignment with Strategy. The transaction technical assistance facility (TA facility) will \nimplement the operational focus of the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) three strategic pillars \nof Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for India (2018\u20132022)1 and relevant priorities identified in \nStrategy  2030,2 to  pursue  sound  project  portfolio  performance  through  structured  capacity \nbuilding, implementation support, and knowledge sharing. The TA facility will provide (i) demand \ndriven  capacity  development  programs  on  project  design,  implementation  and  evaluation \nfollowing government and ADB guidelines and procedures; (ii) seminars on sector and thematic \ntopics; (iii) knowledge products and their sharing and cross learning sessions; and (iv) support for \nsound implementation of ongoing and pipeline projects among the central and state government \nexecuting and implementing agencies through tripartite portfolio review meetings (TPRM) and \nexpert advice. These will ensure sound implementation performance of ongoing projects and \nproject readiness and quality at entry of pipeline projects, with due attention to projects\u2019 impact \nevaluation and lessons learned. The TA facility has been included in India\u2019s Country Operations \nBusiness Plan (2018\u20132020).3 The purpose, scope, implementation arrangements, costs and \nfinancing arrangements were confirmed by the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), Ministry \nof Finance, Government of India in September 2018. \n \n2.  Portfolio Growth and Performance. ADB\u2019s sovereign loan portfolio in India at the \nbeginning of 2018 was $14.38 billion with uncommitted amount of $3.60 billion (25%) and \nundisbursed  amount  of  $8.48  billion  (59%).  The  CPS  envisages  increasing  ADB\u2019s  annual \nsovereign lending from the average of $2.65 billion per year in 2012\u20132016 to $3.00 billion, while \naiming for annual contract award and disbursement to progressively become commensurate with \nthe increased annual commitment level. It also aims at enhancing partnerships in low income \nstates in northern, eastern, and north eastern regions where capacity constraint is a major issue, \nand to new areas such as economic corridors and integrated urban development having more \ncomplex implementation challenges. Executing agencies with little or no prior experience in \nimplementing large-scale projects are expected to receive more ADB lending in the next five \nyears.4   \n \n3.  To  sustain  the  existing  portfolio  performance  and  expand  the  portfolio  to  new  and \nchallenging geographical locations, sectors, and themes, it is crucial to build capacities and \nsystems of executing agencies for designing and implementing projects with high standards. For \nongoing projects, project performance is often affected by underdeveloped capacity of executing \nagencies  in  procurement,  consultant  recruitment,  construction  management,  contract \nadministration, financial management, safeguards, gender, and monitoring and control.5 The \nprojects also often encounter frequent transfers of project directors and other key project staff, \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2017.

The TA first \nappeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 2 April 2018. The allocation for TA facility has \nbeen increased from $1.5 million to $2.5 million \n4  Executing agencies of new projects from Madhya Pradesh, Sikkim, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh among others with little \nexperience in implementing large projects financed by multilateral development banks would be entering the portfolio \nover the next 5 years. \n5 Issues requiring the government interdepartmental coordination such as land acquisition, resettlement, forest \nclearance, and utility shifting pose particular challenges. \n ", "2     \ncalling for due trainings to build and retain institutional knowledge. Low participation of good \nquality  contractors  and  consultants  in  procurement  process  and  poor  performance  during \nimplementation has been another bottleneck, which need to be controlled through effective \nprocurement design, performance monitoring and control mechanisms, and associated systems \nand capacities of the project agencies. These gaps can adversely affect project quality in terms \nof time, cost, and quality, and finally on its outcomes. Further, it is very important to learn from \nthe implementation experience of projects and plough back the lessons learned into the design \nof  new  projects  and  implementation  of  ongoing  projects.  In  addition,  sensitizing  executing \nagencies to thematic topics would facilitate adoption of modern project management practices, \ninnovative approaches, and high level technologies (HLT) among others. \n \n4.  ADB\u2019s Engagement. ADB\u2019s India country operations have addressed these challenges \nthrough Capacity Development Resource Center (CDRC) created under TA 7593-IND: Capacity \nDevelopment for Project Implementation.6 CDRC trained about 6,000 executing agency staff \nduring 2010-2017 on training topics identified through training needs assessment survey. The \ntraining topics included ADB policies and procedures on procurement, consultant recruitment, \nsafeguards, disbursement, financial reporting and auditing, gender and social inclusion, project \nmanagement, contract and construction management, operation and maintenance, and thematic \ntopics such as new construction techniques, road safety, asset management, among others. \nTraining content was finalized in consultation with executing agencies to ensure relevance for \noperations. Training programs were delivered by national institutions, as well as ADB resource \npersons, to make capacity development local resource driven and economical. These institutes \nhave  included  Administrative  Staff  College  of  India  (ASCI),  Indian  Academy  of  Highway \nEngineers, Indian Society for Trenchless Technology, the Energy and Resources Institute, Indian \nInstitute  of  Technology  (Roorkee),  among  others.  A  compendium  of  200  frequently  asked \nquestions on contract management was compiled as ready reference tool. CDRC trainings \nreceived highly positive feedback from executing agencies during an impact assessment study.7 \nThis was also acknowledged by Country Assistance Program Evaluation 2007-2015 (CAPE)8 as \na unique example of capacity development. TPRMs have established an institutional mechanism \nfor  addressing  a  range  of  implementation  issues  from  project  design  and  start  up  toward \nsuccessful completion and evaluation of projects. \n \n5.  The proposed TA facility aspires to consolidate and further strengthen the institutional \napproach for delivering capacity development programs and portfolio oversight through TPRMs. \nIn addition, the TA facility would align the capacity building programs to the strategic framework \nof CPS 2018-22 and relevant operational priorities of Strategy 2030. The proposed TA facility \nwould progressively introduce new materials and instruments, including (i) upgrading training \nmaterials  through  the  most  recent  case  studies;  (ii)  undertaking  advanced  training  needs \nassessment  study  to  identify  specific  capacity  gaps  of  the  selected  agencies;  (iii)  further \ndocumenting good  implementation  practices  as  useful reference materials for  practitioners, \nincluding lessons learned from projects to facilitate improved project design and implementation; \nand (iv) promoting new technologies in individual sectors by establishing catalogues from ADB\u2019s \nknowledge networks. In terms of capacity building approach, the TA facility will prioritize field-\nbased trainings through clinic style issue resolution sessions as compared with classroom \ntrainings,  while  promoting  cross  learning  platforms  to  support  knowledge  transfer  from \nexperienced to new executing agencies. Efforts will also be made to institutionalize capacity \n                                                \n6  The TA was approved in September 2010 and due for closure in December 2018. \n7  The study was published in 2016 under the title Capacity Development for Project Implementation \u2013 The Operation \nand Experience of the Capacity Development Resource Center at ADB\u2019s India Resident Mission. \n8  ADB. 2017.

Furthermore, the TA facility will provide critical support for sound implementation of \nongoing projects in a selective manner during its implementation period.9  \n  \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n6.  Output 1: Capacity Development of Executing Agencies. The TA facility will conduct \n50 capacity building programs to train about 2,000 staff from executing and implementing \nagencies of ongoing and pipeline projects and associated central and state agencies during 2018-\n2021. The topics will cover ADB policies and procedures, project implementation, Public Private \nPartnership (PPP), sector and thematic topics including cutting edge innovations for improved \nproject portfolio performance, with higher emphasis on field level clinic style issue resolution \nworkshops.  The  training  programs  would  be  identified  and  arranged  based  on  capacity \nassessment of executing agencies and periodic training needs surveys. The TA facility will also \nsupport rolling out of ADB\u2019s Procurement Policy 2017. Thematic topics will be reflected into sector \nspecific programs. ADB staff and resource persons from ADB Community of Practice (COP) will \nparticipate in training based on the needs to discuss international best practices. This Output also \naims to incorporate the following features:  \n \n(i)  Based  on  implementation  experience  of  earlier  TA  7593,  the  TA  facility  will \ninstitutionalize training subjects such as fundamentals of project management, \ncontract  management,  construction  management,  and  financial  management, \namong  others  in  anchor  institutions  and  pool  of  local  experts  (including \nexperienced staff from executing agencies) to make the capacity development \nactivities locally driven. Anchor institutions would be supported to offer training \nprograms  to  executing  agencies  of  central  and  state  government  and  other \nagencies on a chargeable basis to make this initiative sustainable.  \n(ii)  Support  training  programs  covering  topics  such  as  ADB\u2019s  project  cycle, \nprocurement,  consultant  selection,  safeguards,  fund  flow,  construction \nmanagement, contract management, DEA project readiness checklist, among \nothers, and encourage new executing agencies to attend these sessions before \nloan negotiations/approval so that they are better capacitated for project design \nand implementation.  \n(iii)  Enhance a training management information system (TMIS) which would improve \ntraining administration efficiency through web-based nominations, selection of \nparticipants, trainee data base, trainee tracking and training logistics management. \nTMIS will be hosted in the existing DEA website eapdea.gov.in.10  \n(iv)  Pilot an advanced training needs assessment study consisting of analysis of job \nroles in the project, skill sets required for performing the job role, existing skill set, \nskill gap and strategies for filling the skill gap to provide enhanced and targeted \ncapacity development support especially for those executing agencies who are in \nthe lower end of the spectrum.   \n                                                \n9  Potential projects include Loan 3001-IND: Himachal Pradesh Clean Energy Transmission Project (Tranche 2) and \nLoan 3183-IND: Rajasthan Urban Sector Development Project and other ongoing and pipeline projects (Appendix \n2). Consultancy support on project, contract and financial management may be provided for Loan 3001 to expedite \nimplementation of Tranche 2 and future tranches. In Loan 3183, the TA facility may support capacity building of \nUrban Local Bodies in operation and maintenance of assets created under the project after turnover. The TA facility \nmay support other projects in India that are under preparation, implementation or evaluation, as needed. \n10 The website eapdea.gov.in is being operated and maintained by DEA and TMIS will be operated and maintained by \nDEA. \n \n ", "4     \n(v)  Conduct six Business Opportunity Seminars (BOS) in collaboration with contractor \nand consultant organizations on a regular basis to disseminate information on \nADB\u2019s business opportunities while undertaking dialogues on the specific ways \nand means to further strengthen the procurement systems based on the field level \nexperience and lessons.  \n \n7.
