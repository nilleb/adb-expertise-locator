INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB), together with the United Nations, governments, \ncivil society, and other multilateral development banks and partners, has agreed to support the \nachievement by ADB developing member countries (DMCs) of the Sustainable Development \nGoals (SDGs).1 As with the Millennium Development Goals, the SDGs will be incorporated into \nADB plans and operations, and resources will be provided to DMCs.2 In addition, ADB has \nacknowledged the post-2015 development agenda in the midterm review of Strategy 2020, and \nstated that the challenges facing the region are consistent with the post-2015 development \nagenda.3 \n2.  Monitoring the SDGs requires timely, high-quality data. In many DMCs, data used for \npolicy making are often outdated, because of the time it takes for results to be made available \nusing traditional paper-and-pencil interviewing (PAPI). Decisions based on older data may not \nreflect  current  realities  in  DMCs.  Recent  advances  in  information  and  communication \ntechnology  (ICT)  tools,  such  as  computer-assisted  personal  interviewing  (CAPI),  offer  the \npotential to improve overall survey data management by reducing the time taken to collect data \nand improving data quality for nationally representative surveys in a cost-effective manner. \n3.  This technical assistance (TA) was conceptualized to promote the use of ICT tools, such \nas CAPI, during the implementation of nationally representative surveys in three selected DMCs \nthat target data collection efforts for the SDGs. Extensive discussions have been conducted \nduring the design of this TA with DMCs and other international organizations that are also \nexploring the use of such ICT tools. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4 \nThe  TA  received  concept  clearance  from  the  Office  of  the  Vice-President  (Knowledge \nManagement and Sustainable Development) on 28 October 2015. \n \nII.   ISSUES \n4.  The monitoring of progress in achieving the outcomes of international development \ninitiatives through the SDGs will be heavily dependent on the availability of timely, high-quality \nstatistics from nationally representative surveys. These national data collection initiatives are \noften implemented using the PAPI method, whereby paper questionnaires are administered to \nrespondents, with numerous manual data-cleaning phases before the necessary statistics can \nbe produced. This results in significant data limitations\u2014in terms of timeliness, accessibility, \navailability, and quality\u2014and is a hindrance for policy makers, who rely on timely, accurate data \nto formulate policies that support the development agenda.5 \n \n5.  The advent of ICT tools and their application to field surveys offers the potential to \nimprove overall survey data management by revolutionizing the collection, storage, and use of \nsurvey data. CAPI is one such technique whereby the interviewer reads questions from the \nscreen of a handheld device (tablet or mobile phone) on which a questionnaire is preloaded. \nThe respondent\u2019s replies are immediately entered and stored onto the device and often on a \n                                                \n1  United  Nations  Economic  and  Social  Council.

Because the data entry application for CAPI \nincorporates the programming of various checks (e.g., range, logical, skip, and consistency), \nmost errors are addressed immediately in the field. Other features include images, audio, video, \nglobal positioning system tracking, and advanced reporting functionalities, which enhance the \nscope and quality of data obtained from field surveys. \n \n6.  While several developed countries have embraced the advantages presented by CAPI, \ndeveloping  countries  have  been  slow  to  adopt  these  technological  advancements  in  data \ncollection and management.6 However, a number of DMCs have made efforts to integrate \ntablets and other handheld devices into their national census and other household surveys, and \nFiji, India, Indonesia, Mongolia, and the Philippines are among DMCs considered to be early \nusers of CAPI. \n \n7.  Introducing  ICT  tools  such  as  CAPI  involves  significant  learning  costs  and \nimplementation challenges. Transitioning from PAPI to CAPI will require a one-time substantial \ninvestment in hardware, software, and associated equipment. Additionally, adopting CAPI may \nrequire some organizational changes for DMCs because the tasks required to implement them \nfor surveys differ from those needed in the traditional PAPI method. Despite these challenges, \nDMCs should choose to maximize the scalability benefits of transitioning to CAPI and capitalize \non the long-term advantages and sustainability of the newer methodology, with organizations \nsuch as ADB demonstrating the long-term benefits of adopting ICT tools (e.g., CAPI). \n \n8.  Several consultations have been held with DMCs and international organizations that \nare exploring the use of ICT tools in conducting surveys. Interactions with 27 DMCs through \nstatistical capacity-building projects involving field surveys and regional events organized by \ninternational organizations (e.g., the United Nations Statistics Division, the World Bank and the \nFood and Agriculture Organization) have revealed the urgent need to transition to advanced \ndata collection practices using ICT tools.7 \n \n9.  This TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 and midterm review priorities that seek to \nuse ICT more effectively for storage, retrieval, and dissemination of knowledge products and \ndata. This TA will also contribute to bridging technological gaps between the national statistical \nsystems  of  DMCs  and  developed  countries,  and  support  ADB\u2019s  strategic  priority  of \nstrengthening innovation, technology and education. \n \n10.  This TA will support actions supported collectively by development partners in the Busan \nAction  Plan  for  Statistics.8 Data  collected  in  national  surveys  of  participating  DMCs  and \nsupported by this TA will be made available in the ADB network through the Portal for Statistics \nResources.9 This is in line with the Busan Action Plan for Statistics, which seeks to encourage \nthe use of new methods and technologies to increase the reliability and accessibility of statistics. \n                                                \n6  W.

This  TA  will  also  directly  uphold  SDG  17  by  addressing  data,  monitoring,  and \naccountability  through  support  for  statistical  capacity  building  via  improved  data  collection \nmethods.10 It is expected to spur innovation by enhancing the scope and quality of data, both \nrelated to the SDGs and for overall monitoring of development indicators in the three selected \nDMCs. It is also expected to catalyze similar ICT interventions by line ministries and agencies \nthat collect survey data. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact will be the coverage, quality, and timeliness of statistical indicators produced \nby the national statistical systems of DMCs participating in the TA activities improved through \ntechnological  improvements  in  field  data  collection  methods  for  nationally  representative \nsurveys linked to the SDGs. The outcome will be survey practices using ICT tools, such as \nCAPI, adopted by participating DMCs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  To achieve its expected outcome, this TA will undertake three major activities: (i) training \nsessions for information technology (IT) and field staff on the use of ICT tools, such as CAPI, in \ndata  collection  for  nationally  representative  surveys;  (ii)  creation  and  dissemination  of \ncustomized survey tools with detailed reports, documentation, and manuals on the use of ICT \ntools to improve data collection and management; and (iii) development of an online training \nprogram through a massive online open course platform on the use of ICT tools for improved \nsurvey data collection and management. \n \n14.  The  three  DMCs  participating  in  this  TA  will  be  selected  in  consultation  with  their \ngovernments  and  ADB  regional  departments.  The  following  criteria  will  be  considered  in \ndetermining which DMCs to include: (i) response to a letter of interest to DMCs to ascertain \nexisting ICT capabilities in their national statistics offices (NSOs), particularly in regards to \nCAPI; (ii) availability and capability of NSO staff to engage in adaptation and implementation of \nICT tools developed by the project; (iii) the willingness of the NSO management committee to \nincorporate ICT tools in planned future surveys, or in their national strategy for the development \nof statistics; (iv) incorporation of CAPI in national surveys in 2017 or 2018; (v) subregional \nvariations that allow ICT tools to be tested in different settings; (vi) the DMC\u2019s score on the \nWorld Bank Statistical Capacity Indicator11 as a measure of the ability of the NSOs to meet the \nneeds of data users by providing good quality statistics; and (vii) presence of IT infrastructure \nthat is sufficient to enable the project to be conducted. \n \n15.  IT and field staff will be trained on the use of ICT tools, such as CAPI, in data collection \nfor  nationally  representative  surveys  following  consultant  recruitment,  ICT  tool  and  DMC \nselection, and the receipt by ADB of a \u201cno objection\u201d from participating countries. Training \nsessions will include (i) an inception workshop to establish a clear, common project objective; \npresent the CAPI method to participating DMCs; and share best practices from the region; (ii) \nin-country training sessions and regional workshops, spread over 2 years, to build the statistical \n                                                \n10  United  Nations  2015:  Time  for  Global  Action.

Data on Statistical Capacity. http://datatopics.worldbank.org/statisticalcapacity/ \n ", "4  \ncapacity of participating DMCs in technical (focused on IT staff) and nontechnical (focused on \nfield staff) aspects of the selected ICT tools; and (iii) a dissemination workshop to communicate \nTA outputs and distribute the training materials, including to nonparticipating DMCs. \n \n16.  The data management and/or IT departments of the participating DMCs are expected to \nhouse and/or own the system. The in-country training sessions will target IT staff, and be \nconducted sequentially for each DMC to enable building on previous training work. Additionally, \nbimonthly training sessions will be conducted by in-country specialists to ensure knowledge \ntransfer is sustainable. Midterm and final regional workshops for DMC IT staff will facilitate the \ntransfer of knowledge between DMCs. \n \n17.  ICT tools will be selected by comparing how robust various software features are (e.g., \nsecurity,  programming,  development  environment,  interface  for  actual  users,  questionnaire \nimplementation,  questionnaire  navigation,  case  and  field  management,  data  transfer,  data \nexport,  internet  connectivity,  support  and  documentation,  subscription  and  upgrades,  and \nhardware and software requirements). The recommendations of participating DMCs will be \nconsidered in finalizing the ICT tools. Freely available CAPI software will be explored while \nensuring that it is easy to use, has free updates, and provides technical support past the life of \nthe project, with sufficient useful features to support all types of surveys that DMCs require. \n \n18.  A handbook and technical papers will be produced at the completion of the TA that focus \non  the  creation  and  dissemination  of  customized  survey  tools  with  detailed  reports, \ndocumentation, and manuals on the use of ICT tools, such as CAPI, to improve data collection \nand management. The handbook will be translated into the languages of the participating DMCs \nand  include  procedures  on  transforming  PAPI  surveys  into  CAPI  surveys.  Additionally, \nknowledge sharing and in-house seminars with relevant ADB communities of practice will be \nconducted  at  venues  such  as  ADB\u2019s  knowledge  hub  or  through  Economic  Research  and \nRegional Cooperation Department seminars. \n \n19.  The ICT tools developed as part of this project will target household, agriculture, and \nenterprise surveys. The technical papers from this TA will use a randomized experimental \ndesign to explore the policy implications of using CAPI data. For example, if error counts in a \nhousehold budget survey are found to be correlated with survey design characteristics, the \nmean and spread of household consumption may be different between CAPI and PAPI, with \nstrong implications for poverty measurements. By comparing estimates for plot area based on \nfarmer recall rather than global positioning system measurements in agricultural surveys, it is \npossible  to  determine  the  implications  of  measurement  error  in  the  inverse  farm  size\u2013\nproductivity relationship. By introducing consistency checks in enterprise surveys through CAPI, \nmeasurement errors in profits and sales can be compared with detailed revenue and expense \nmodules, improving the precision of gross domestic product calculations. \n \n20.  For the development of an online training program through a massive online open \ncourse platform on the use of ICT tools for improved survey data collection and management, a \nlink to the online course (with the option of subtitles) will be disseminated across the region, \nthereby  ensuring  that  the  know-how,  skills,  and  experiences  of  participating  DMCs  are \ndisseminated to other DMCs and relevant ADB departments interested in using ICT tools for \nsurveys. \n \n21.  Collaboration with international organizations will be pursued wherever possible, and \nindividual resource persons will be engaged for not more than 10 working days to provide need-\nbased technical support. \n ", "  5\n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n22.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,300,000, of which $700,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The governments of the selected \nDMCs will provide counterpart support in the form of implementing agencies\u2019 staff salaries, \noffice  space,  transport,  planning,  implementation,  data  cleaning  and  analysis,  survey \ndissemination costs, and other survey-related and administrative support costs necessary for \nthe administration of the TA. ADB will only fund the incorporation and field implementation of \nCAPI. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n23.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency for this TA.  The  Development  Economics  and \nIndicators Division will administer the TA by collaborating closely with relevant ADB units, such \nas  the  Department  of External  Relations, Office  of  Information  Systems  and Technology \n(OIST),  Sustainable  Development  and  Climate  Change  Department,  Strategy  and  Policy \nDepartment,  and  regional  departments  working  on  related  issues.  OIST  will  provide \nrecommendations and clearance for all equipment, software, and IT requirements of the TA. \nThe Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department, through its k-learn team, will \nprovide inputs on the development of the training course. The Strategy and Policy Department, \nas ADB\u2019s focal point on the SDGs, will also be consulted through the implementation of this \nTA. The Department of External Relations will assist in promoting the online training course. \nThe  NSOs  in  the  selected  DMCs  will  be  the  implementing  agencies.  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented over 38 months, from December 2015 to January 2019. \n \n24.   This project will contract 43 person-months of consulting services\u2014with 23 person-\nmonths provided by a consulting firm, and 20 person-months by individual consultants\u2014to \nimplement the TA components in the participating DMCs. The consulting firm will provide \ninternational and national consultants who are (i) specialists in ICT and related tools for \nimplementing national surveys, and (ii) professionals who can provide the necessary technical \nand/or administrative support. In selecting the firm, the quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod will be used. All consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with the ADB \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The terms of \nreference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n25.  ADB will procure equipment, and computer hardware and software in accordance with \nits  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Procurement  will  be \ncoordinated  with  ADB\u2019s  OIST  and  Office  of  Administrative  Services.  Upon  TA  completion, \nprocured equipment will be disposed of and/or transferred to the implementing agencies in \naccordance  with  the  project  administration  instruction  on  administering  grant-financed  TA \nprojects. Disbursement under the TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n26.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 on a grant basis for \nImplementing Information and Communication Technology Tools to Improve Data Collection \nand Management of National Surveys in Support of the Sustainable Development Goals, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact of the Project: \nThe coverage, quality, and timeliness of statistical indicators produced by the national statistical systems \nof DMCs participating in the TA activities improved through technological improvements in field data \ncollection methods for nationally representative surveys linked to the SDGs (project defined)a \n   Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome:       \n \nSurvey practices  a.
