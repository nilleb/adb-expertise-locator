THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation for a proposed loan to \nthe  Republic  of  the  Philippines  under  subprogram  2  of  the  Financial  Market  Regulation  and \nIntermediation Program.  \n \n2.  Subprogram 2 will increase savings to facilitate growth, investment, and poverty reduction \nin line with the Medium-Term Philippines Development Plan, 2004\u20132010. It will also recognize and \nsupport the government\u2019s sharpened focus on the financial sector arising out of the global financial \ncrisis. Reform priorities include measures to enhance financial sector stability and liquidity, and to \nsupport  the  development  of  more  effective  regulatory  architecture.  Finally,  the  reformulated \nsubprogram  seeks  to  reduce  the  potential  of  regulatory  arbitrage  and  capture  by  directly \naddressing governance and operational weaknesses in the Securities and Exchange Commission \n(SEC) and Insurance Commission that had led to slippage under the original subprogram 2.1  \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The Philippine capital markets do not produce a level of intermediation sufficient to support \ngrowth  and  alleviate  poverty.  Capital  market  development  has  been  constrained  by  the \npredominance  of  family-owned  mixed  use  conglomerates,  connected  lending,  a  perception  of \nheightened market instability, low investor confidence, and the lack of an enabling environment.  \nInadequate intermediation between savers and investors has slowed Philippine economic growth \nand development.   \n \n4.  The government recognizes these issues, including the linkage between financial sector \ndevelopment and poverty reduction,2 and has prioritized financial sector development within its \ndevelopment plan. The program cluster is anchored in the Medium-Term Philippines Development \nPlan,  2004\u20132010.  To  increase  the  contribution  of  the  financial  sector  to  growth  and  poverty \nreduction, this plan seeks to mobilize savings to achieve a savings to GDP rate of 25%\u201330% and \nan  investment  to  GDP  rate  of  28%.  The  program  will  contribute  to  economic  growth  and \ndevelopment by providing an enabling environment, increasing investment alternatives, enhancing \ndisclosures, and improving market efficiency. In turn, financial sector development will help reduce \npoverty  through  higher  economic  growth,  financial  sector  inclusiveness,  and  financial  sector \nstability.  \n \n5.  The impact and lessons of the global financial crisis have highlighted weaknesses in the \nPhilippine  financial  sector  that  were  not  addressed  by  the  original  subprogram  2.  The  crisis \ndemonstrated the importance of maintaining financial stability, including the capacity to provide \nliquidity in sufficient quantity and at reasonable price to ensure smooth functioning of the financial \nand payment systems. The crisis also increased recognition of the need to strengthen regulatory \noversight  to  reduce  financial  sector  vulnerabilities,  and  in  particular  the  need  to  enhance \n                                                 \n1 Slippage under the original subprogram 2 occurred when the SEC and Insurance Commission failed to implement \npolicy actions agreed to under the original program. The SEC failed to strengthen market surveillance, monitoring of \nbroker/dealers and PSE self-regulatory functions and failed to lodge the necessary amendments to law with Congress. \nThe Insurance Commission deferred a planned re-organization, and eventually completed the reorganization in a \nmanner  inconsistent  with  the  agreed  policy  action.  The  Insurance  Commission  also  indefinitely  deferred  the \nimplementation of higher capital standards.     \n2 There is a strong positive relationship between the level of financial sector assets and per capita incomes and the \nincidence of poverty. See Sector Assessment (Summary): Finance (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n ", "2   \ncoordination  and  cooperation  between  micro  and  macro-prudential  supervision.  Enhanced \ncoordination is necessary to achieve better supervision of complex conglomerates that operate \nacross commercial, banking, securities, and insurance markets. Should the efforts of the regulator \nfail, the financial system must be backstopped by an effective resolution methodology. The crisis \nunderscored the need to maintain an adequately funded deposit insurance mechanism to minimize \nthe risk of depositor flight and contagion. It also highlighted the need to establish and maintain \nefficient and liquid markets, as countries with well-functioning and liquid local bond markets were \nbetter able to cope with shocks to the global credit markets.     \n \n6.  Subprogram 2 has been reformulated to address three key considerations. First, there has \nbeen a sharpened and renewed focus with regard to government policy priorities for the financial \nsector. Subprogram 2 now includes a number of measures designed to enhance financial sector \nstability in direct response to heightened instability arising out of the global financial crisis. Second, \nsubprogram  2  recognizes  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to  coordinate  micro  and  macro  prudential \nsupervision;  and  to  close  the  gaps  in  supervision  caused  by  the  use  of  separate  functional \nregulators to supervise complex, mixed use conglomerates. Third, the reformulated subprogram 2 \nsupports  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to  address  significant  weaknesses  in  the  governance  and \noperational effectiveness of both the SEC and the Insurance Commission that had led to slippage \nunder the original subprogram 2. The SEC and the Insurance Commission operated with a lack of \nfiscal autonomy and inadequate budgets. In turn, suppressed salaries and high employee turnover \nlimited the ability of the SEC to perform effective market surveillance and on-site examinations of \nthe financial entities under its mandate.  \n \n7.  By strengthening the coordination between regulators, as well as the operational and fiscal \nautonomy of the SEC and the Insurance Commission, sequenced capacity development can be \ninitiated,  which  will  allow  the  government  to  focus  more  effectively  on  the  issues  that  have \nconstrained development of the capital markets.  \n \n8.  Finally, subprogram 2 will assist the government in alleviating poverty by developing a \nfinancial sector that is deeper, more diversified, and more responsive to the immediate funding \nneeds of the economy. Financial intermediaries will be enabled to develop a wider range of \nattractive financial products for consumers, which will improve individual incomes as well as the \nefficiency of intermediation by channeling greater savings into the financial system. Development \nof the capital market will also reduce transactions costs and contribute to macroeconomic stability, \nproviding  an  environment  that  fosters  the  creation  of  income-  and  employment-generating \nactivities.   \n \n9.  The original subprogram 2 specified 39 indicative actions, of which 10 were policy triggers \nfor subprogram 2. The reformulated subprogram 2 merged several of the indicative actions to \nreflect accomplishments, several measures were refined, and some were shifted to the post-\nprogram partnership framework (P3F) 3 to reflect the sequencing of reforms.4 Others were dropped \non the basis that they are no longer relevant, improperly sequenced or overly prescriptive. Of the \n10 original policy triggers for subprogram 2, five have been fully accomplished, three have been \npartially accomplished and retained as policy triggers under subprogram 2, and two have been \nmoved to the P3F to reflect a proper sequencing of reforms and the difficulty involved in enacting \nlaws.  Given  the  linkage  between  the  original  and  reformulated  subprogram  2,  no  significant \nchanges were made to the impact, outcome, or outputs of the program. The size of subprogram 2 \n                                                 \n3 The P3F is a medium-term action plan that has been agreed to by the government and ADB. This action plan contains \na series of indicative actions designed to continue the momentum of reform beyond subprogram 2. However, these \nactions, which can be found in the attached policy matrix, do not represent conditionalities or formal commitments.    \n4 Status of Original Indicative Actions from Financial Market Regulation and Intermediation Program, Subprogram 2 \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n ", "  3\nhas been maintained at $200 million in accordance with the original recommendation provided in \nsubprogram 1.5,6  \n   \n10.  To maintain the momentum and sustainability of reforms, the government and the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) have agreed to a revised P3F covering the next 24 months, which \ncreates a basis for continuous policy dialogue. The P3F includes 16 indicative measures designed \nto (i) enhance regulatory coordination and cooperation, including micro and macro prudential \nsupervision; (ii) strengthen banking resolution and asset disposition processes; (iii) restructure the \nSEC  and  boost  surveillance  and  examination  capabilities;  (iv)  strengthen  the  Insurance \nCommission; and (v) implement an active debt management strategy. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of FMRIP-02 will be improved access to finance and increased contribution of \nthe financial sector to economic growth. The outcome will be a deeper, more diversified, and \nresilient financial sector.   \n \n12.  The  reformulated  subprogram  2  and  the  P3F  include  a  set  of  accomplishments  and \nproposed measures to mitigate increased risks to the financial sector in the short term arising from \nthe global financial crisis. The subprogram also contains longer-term measures to strengthen \npublic debt management as well as the policy and regulatory framework of the financial sector to \nmitigate future system shocks. To meet these objectives, the reformulated subprogram comprises \nthree primary outputs: enhanced financial sector stability, strengthened financial sector regulatory \noversight, and improved financial sector efficiency and liquidity. \n \n13.  While the impact, outcome, and outputs of subprogram 2 mirror those of subprogram 1, \nchanges have been incorporated to sharpen the focus of the program. In particular, the outputs \nhave been shifted to outcomes to reflect the requirements of the current design and monitoring \nframework. In addition, a number of performance indicators have been omitted to reflect progress \nmade under subprogram 1. Other qualitative performance measures have been replaced with \nmore relevant and focused quantitative indicators. Assumptions and risks have been compacted to \neliminate duplication. \n \n1.  Output 1: Enhanced Financial Sector Stability \n14.  To mitigate the immediate effects of the crisis, the government has enacted a number of \nmeasures to strengthen its ability to assure the stability of the financial sector and to reduce \nsystemic risk. The central bank, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), adopted measures to provide \nadditional liquidity to the banking sector and enhanced its ability to serve as a lender of last resort \nby  doubling  the  peso  rediscounting  facility  to  P60  million,  as  well  as  opening  a  US dollar \nrepurchase facility. BSP also submitted proposed amendments to Congress to strengthen its \nmonetary policy framework, including a mandate to carry out open market operations of BSP bills. \nIn addition, Congress doubled the deposit insurance ceiling to P500,000 and granted the Philippine \nDeposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC) additional powers, including the flexibility to adjust the \nmaximum deposit insurance ceiling in times of systemic stress and to exclude deposits from the \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2006. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Program Cluster, Loan, \nand  Technical  Assistance  Grant  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for  the  Financial  Market  Regulation  and \nIntermediation Program. Manila (Loan 2278-PHI, approved on 6 December). \n6 A total loan of US$400 million from the ADB's Ordinary Capital Resources was approved for Financial Market \nRegulation and Intermediation Program under the two subprograms - US$200 million for Subprogram 1 and US$200 \nmillion for Subprogram 2. \n \n ", "4   \ndeposit  insurance  coverage  scheme  in  cases  of  fraud  or  abuse.  PDIC  also  established  a \nmechanism to build up and maintain an adequate deposit insurance fund (DIF) and has approved \na resolution for submission to Congress in support of legislation to establish bridge banking and \nother resolution methodologies.   \n \n15.  The  Philippines  has  completed  a  Financial  Sector  Assessment  Program7 and,  under \nsubprogram 2, the BSP, PDIC, and SEC have begun implementing corrective actions to address \nfinancial sector risks as well as regulatory and structural bottlenecks identified in the assessment. \nThe  BSP  and  PDIC  have  combined  their  efforts  to  encourage  industry  consolidation.  The \nStrengthening  Program  for  Rural  Banks  was  launched  with  P5  billion  in  funding  to  provide \nincentives  for  weaker  rural  banks  to  merge  with  stronger  rural  banks.  The  PDIC  board  also \napproved the investor-investee framework, which is an electronic matching system intended to \nfacilitate mergers, acquisitions, and consolidation among banks. \n    \n16.  To enhance financial sector stability and reduce systemic risk, the Department of Finance \n(DOF) has strengthened its capacity for public debt management and has prepared a needs \nassessment  for  its  newly  established  Debt  and  Risk  Management  Division.  The  division \nsubsequently prepared a draft public debt management strategy for FY2011 as well as a debt \nsustainability assessment for FY\u2019s 2010 and 2011. \n \n2.  Output 2: Strengthened Financial Sector Regulatory Oversight \n17.  Under subprogram 2, measures were implemented to improve interagency coordination \nand sharing of information, and to strengthen regulatory oversight functions in the financial sector. \nThe enforcement powers of the PDIC were strengthened and the SEC enhanced its capacity for \nmarket surveillance. Subprogram 2 addresses the long-standing governance weaknesses of the \nSEC and the Insurance Commission by sequencing reforms over the medium to long term, with the \nprimary objective of lifting the capacity of the two agencies toward a par with the other financial \nsector regulators (i.e., BSP and PDIC).  \n \n18.  Subprogram 2 also promotes greater integration and coordination between the different \nregulators,  with  the  goal  of  establishing  a  highly  coordinated  financial  sector  regulatory  and \nsurveillance  framework  to  enhance  the  conduct  of  micro  and  macro  prudential  supervision. \nMemorandums  of  understanding  setting  out  the  working  relationship  of  the  regulators  in  the \nFinancial Stability Forum (FSF)8 have been signed. Standing committees have been established to \naddress standardization of supervision and risk measurement across regulators, as well as for \noptimizing  the  regulatory  architecture.  BSP  has  just  issued  its  third  Financial Sector  Stability \nReport.9 Subprogram 2 initially anticipates supporting the internal efforts of the FSF to strengthen \nearly warning systems, and promoting better coordination and communication. Subprogram 2 will \nstrengthen coordination between BSP and the PDIC with regard to the examination of problematic \nbanks to lessen the risk to the DIF.  \n \n19.  Congress amended the PDIC charter to grant the agency the authority to adopt a new or \nrevised organizational structure and to provide enhanced legal protection for its staff. The PDIC \nmay now conduct special examinations in coordination with BSP when there are threats of bank \n                                                 \n7  International Monetary Fund. 2010. Financial System Stability Assessment Update. IMF Country Report No. 10/90. \nWashington, DC (April). \n8  The  FSF,  which  is  chaired  by  the  BSP  and  governed  by  a  memorandum  of  understanding,  is  a  semiformal \ncoordinating body of the financial sector regulatory agencies in the Philippines including the BSP, the Insurance \nCommission, the SEC, and the PDIC. \n9  This Financial Sector Stability Report is currently circulated as an internal document with external publication planned \nafter the document has been thoroughly vetted by stakeholders.  \n ", "  5\nclosures, and may examine deposit accounts in cases of unsafe and unsound practices. Congress \nfurther granted the PDIC the authority to rescind splitting of deposits within 120 days before bank \nclosure. This authority is expected to enhance stability and to contain losses to the DIF arising out \nof high rate deposit promotions that have been used to forestall the timely resolution of problem \nbanks. The extension of examination authority to deposit accounts in specified situations is also \nexpected to curtail the use of high rate deposit promotions to fund fraudulent or other improper \nactivities. \n   \n20.  Subprogram 2 places the SEC under the DOF\u2019s administrative authority, which should \nstrengthen the SEC\u2019s ability to pursue reforms.10 The DOF, in consultation with the SEC, produced \nand endorsed an action plan for restructuring the SEC. This plan identified the core responsibilities \nof the SEC and recommended arrangements to deal with non-core responsibilities. It also identified \norganizational structures, staffing complements and skill sets, and pay scales. Finally, the plan will \nidentify a funding mechanism to ensure the eventual administrative and fiscal autonomy of the \nagency. In the interim, the government (Department of Budget and Management [DBM]) raised the \nSEC\u2019s proposed 2011 general budget appropriation to accommodate the priority recommendations \nof the action plan, as committed to higher resources in the DBM\u2019s forward estimates, until an \nindependent, self-funding mechanism can be established.   \n \n21.  The DOF, in consultation with the Insurance Commission, will produce an action plan for \nrestructuring  the  Insurance  Commission.  This  plan  will  contain  recommendations  regarding \nrestructuring the agency to address the organizational structure as well as staff size, skills, and \nremuneration.  As  with  the  SEC,  recommendations  will  be  provided  to  establish  a  funding \nmechanism to ensure ongoing administrative and fiscal autonomy. Completion and implementation \nof the action plan will be monitored under the P3F.  \n \n3.  Output 3: Improved Efficiency and Liquidity in Securities Markets \n22.  To develop an efficient and liquid secondary market, the SEC defined the guidelines for the \nover-the-counter market, which included the requirement for a central trade reporting system. This \neffectively provides for price discovery of the bilateral transactions that define the over-the-counter \nmarket, aligning it with the data capture and reporting standards used in exchange-based markets. \nSubsequently, the SEC approved listing requirements and trading rules of the designated self-\nregulatory  organization,  effectively  providing  an  enabling  environment  for  trading  in  corporate \nbonds on the fixed-income exchange. To stimulate secondary trading and accelerate the pace of \ncapital market development, Congress enacted a permanent stamp duty exemption for secondary \ntrading of listed companies.  \n \n23.  Several enabling laws were passed, including the Personal Equity Retirement Account Act, \n2008,  which  creates  a  tax-free  personal  retirement  account,  and  the  Law  on  Real  Estate \nInvestment Trusts, 2009, which is expected to act as a stimulus to capital market development by \nproviding a method to increase investor participation in the real estate market. Together, these acts \nshould stimulate demand for both investment products and professional investment management. \nImplementing  regulations  for  the  Personal  Equity  Retirement  Act  are  expected  to  include  a \nrequirement for formal training and licensing of investment professionals similar to the Series 7 \nlicense in the United States. Finally, the Credit Information System Act, 2008, should improve the \nflow of credit by providing banks and other credit granting institutions better access to information \non which to base underwriting and pricing decisions.  \n \n                                                 \n10 Since early 2009, the SEC has been under the jurisdiction of the Department of Trade and Industry. \n \n ", "6   \nC.  Post-Program Partnership Framework \n24.  To maintain the momentum and sustainability of the reforms, the government and ADB \nhave  agreed  to  a  post-program  monitoring  framework  covering  the  next  24  months.  Actions \nplanned  within  the  framework  focus  on  three  primary  objectives:  (i)  strengthening  regulatory \ncooperation  and  coordination  to  enhance  the  linkages  between  micro  and  macro  prudential \nregulation, (ii) regulatory capacity development, and (iii) enhancing public debt management. \n \n25.  To continue strengthening collective oversight of the financial markets, BSP along with \nother  members  of  the  FSF  will  explore  alternative  arrangements  with  respect  to  the  joint \nsupervision of the financial submarkets, and will improve disclosures, streamline reporting by \nregulated financial entities, and initiate a more effective framework for sharing information among \nthe FSF. In line with the Financial Sector Assessment Program priority recommendations, the FSF \nwill, where and when warranted, invite the DOF to participate in FSF meetings, and BSP and the \nPDIC will enhance coordination with regard to early intervention in problem banks.  \n \n26.  Capacity development during the P3F covers a wide array of activities, and begins with the \nimplementation of an action plan to restructure the SEC and to implement a capacity development \nprogram for on-site examinations of regulated entities in line with international standards. Further, \nthe SEC will enhance its market surveillance system to provide regulatory parity in terms of \nsupervision, reporting, and compliance with risk-based capital adequacy requirements between \nbroker members of the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) and nonmembers who currently report \ndirectly to the SEC. The Insurance Commission will reorganize in a manner similar to the SEC and \nwill strengthen its risk-based capital adequacy formula in line with international standards.   \n \n27.  To  strengthen  public  debt  management,  the  DOF  will  implement  its  public  debt \nmanagement  strategy,  and  will  continue  to  update  the  strategy  and  the  debt  sustainability \nassessment on an annual basis. Additional, but less predictable, actions under the P3F include the \npassage of amendments to the BSP\u2019s charter, and the Securities Regulation Code.   \n \nD.  Program Costs and Financing \n28.  The size of the proposed loan is based primarily on (i) the importance of the sector in \nsupporting the economic growth of the Philippines, and (ii) the considerable real costs involved in \nimplementing the reforms as well as the political resistance to strengthening the regulators. In the \nabsence  of  timely  reforms,  the  financial  sector  will  remain  vulnerable  to  systemic  risks,  and \ninvestors will be vulnerable to fraud and misconduct. \n \n29.  Direct adjustment costs are considered significant at an estimated $263 million, net of \nshort-term gains.11 Administrative costs will increase under subprogram 2, including the recently \nlaunched Strengthening Program for Rural Banks, which provides financial incentives for weaker \nrural  banks  to  merge  with  stronger  rural  banks.  This  fund  has  been  supported  by  initial \ncapitalization of P5 billion obtained in equal parts from BSP and the PDIC. Reorganizing the SEC \nand increasing its budget commensurate with its mandate will require a diversion of funds from the \nnational budget back to the SEC. In addition, capital expenditures will be required to upgrade the \nagencies  Information  Technology  infrastructure  and  surveillance  capabilities.  Moreover,  other \nagencies, including the PDIC will be required to boost operating budgets due to the increase in \nduties and functions arising out of the revised laws, and the government will be required to fund the \nnewly created Debt Management Office. \n \n                                                 \n11 Summary Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  7\n30.  Fiscal  costs  are  also  considered  significant.  When  the  legacy  banking  system  finally \ncollapsed in late 2008, due to unsafe and unsound lending practices, the attendant losses to the \nPDIC alone were estimated at $326 million. At the same time, the national government has \nprovided a direct backstop in the form of a guarantee of the additional deposit insurance coverage \nin excess of previous P250,000 maximum for a period of 3 years. Estimates indicate that, at the \ndate of the increase in deposit insurance coverage, insured deposits increased by 35% or by $8 \nbillion. Thus, a contingent liability has been created for an as-yet-undetermined amount over this 3-\nyear period. Further, the permanent exemption of the documentary stamp tax on secondary sales \nof listed securities is estimated to reduce revenue to the government by between $5 million to $10 \nmillion per year. While the Personal Equity Retirement Account (PERA) and the Real Estate \nInvestment Trust (REIT) acts are expected to be tax neutral, revenue losses in the near term are \nmore likely than not. \n \n31.  To support these reforms, the government has requested a loan of $200 million from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 15-year term, including \na grace period of 3 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and \nsuch  other terms  and  conditions set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  The  government  has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility based on these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its \nown independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n32.  The program cluster implementation period is from 1 January 2005 to 15 October 2011 and \nthe  subprogram  2  implementation  period  is  from  1  January  2008  to  15  October  2011.  Loan \nproceeds will be available to the Philippines as the borrower for subprogram 2 with withdrawal in a \nsingle tranche, subject to conditions specified in the loan agreement. The loan proceeds will be \nused to finance the full foreign exchange cost (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced \nand procured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible items and imports financed by other \nbilateral and multilateral sources. In accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans12, the proceeds of the \nprogram loan will be disbursed to the Philippines as the borrower. \n \n33.  Under the original subprogram 1, approved by ADB Board of Directors in December 2006, \nthe DOF was designated the executing agency and the SEC was designated the implementing \nagency as well as the chair of the coordinating committee established under the program cluster. \nThe reformulated subprogram 2 retains the DOF as the executing agency.  However, FMRIP-02 \nexpands  responsibility  for  implementation  by  naming  all  affected  agencies  as  implementing \nagencies, including; DOF, SEC, BSP, PDIC and Insurance Commission. The DOF will replace the \nSEC  as  chair  of  the  coordinating  committee,  which  will  comprise  the  DOF  as  chair,  and \nrepresentatives  from  BSP,  the  PDIC,  the  Insurance  Commission,  the  Philippine  Dealing  and \nExchange Corporation, and the PSE. The committee will meet semi-annually to coordinate and \nensure effective implementation of the proposed reforms. Under the P3F, the DOF would become \nthe coordinating agency but would rely on the FSF to coordinate policy matters related to that body \nof regulators.   \n \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 1998.

Serious concerns have been raised with regard to inadequate standards of governance and \nthe  incidence  of  corruption  in  the  Philippines.  The  government\u2019s  Medium-Term  Philippine \nDevelopment Plan views graft and corruption as threats to the sustained growth and development \nof the country. The consensus is strong that good governance and a curtailment of corruption are \nneeded for a successful partnership to reduce poverty in the Philippines. \n \n35.  In view of these issues, subprogram 2 has been designed to enhance governance and \nreduce opportunities for corruption. The thrust will be to restart and implement regulatory reforms \nby promoting the independence of the regulators, and to separate operator and regulator functions. \nMoreover, institutional reforms will aim to ensure transparency and accountability to mitigate, if not \neradicate,  administrative  impropriety  of  government  agencies.  This  will  be  reinforced  by \nencouraging closer cooperation and coordination among the financial services regulatory agencies. \nCollectively,  all  three  regulatory  agencies  are  increasing  the  level  of  their  coordination  and \ncooperation within the FSF. Such coordination and transparency is expected to boost the capacity \nof  all  three  regulators  and  to  reduce  the  possibility  of  capture  of  any  one  of  the  agencies. \nIndividually, the regulatory bodies have moved to strengthen governance over the program cluster \nimplementation  period.  The  addition  of  BSP  as  a  stakeholder  introduces  a  strong  voice  and \nchampion of reform. \n \n36.  Significant progress is noted in strengthening public expenditure management and reducing \ncorruption in the revenue-collecting agencies. ADB, in conjunction with the World Bank and Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency,  has  been  engaged  with  the  government  through  the \nDevelopment Policy and Support Program.13 Overall, the program supported enhancements to \npublic financial management governance by (i) improving budget preparation, budget execution, \naccounting, recording, and reporting; (ii) strengthening performance management and improving \npublic  service  delivery;  (iii)  reforming  procurement;  and  (iv)  implementing  anticorruption  and \nenforcement strategies for revenue-collecting agencies, and key procurement agencies.  \n \n37.  The government has also initiated measures in the revenue agencies and selected line \nministries to reduce corruption. These actions included the completion of integrity development \nreviews in key agencies, publication of audit reports for all government departments, and the \ninitiation of anticorruption revenue programs which have led to an increase in the number of cases \nfiled  to  Department  of  Justice.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and the DOF.  \n \n38.  Following the program period, the DOF will report to ADB on a semi-annual basis to assess \nthe impact of the program, and will hold consultative meetings as needed with stakeholders and \ndevelopment partners to solicit their feedback on emerging regulations involving the financial \nsector and the impact of the program cluster and the P3F implementation. The government and \nADB will jointly carry out periodic progress reviews regarding the impact and evaluate the benefits \nof the program, comprising performance indicators agreed by the government and ADB. The DOF \nwill be responsible for maintaining all monitoring data and evaluating program benefits. It will \nsubmit a program completion report to ADB within 12 months after the program period, assessing \ncompliance with, and the impact of, the agreed actions under  subprogram 2 and program cluster. \nThe  government  will  encourage  development  partners,  business  groups,  and  other  sector \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2007. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Report and Recommendation of \nthe President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Program Cluster, Loan, and Technical Assistance to the Republic of \nthe Philippines for the Development Policy Support Program (Subprogram 1). Manila (Loan 2315-PHI, $250,000,000, \napproved on 8 February). \n ", "  9\nstakeholders to support monitoring of the reforms and agreed actions under the program cluster \nand the P3F. \n \nB.  Poverty and Social \n39.  To achieve its poverty reduction goals, the government will need to generate higher levels \nof financial intermediation and economic growth. To support higher levels of economic growth and \ninvestment, the capital market investor base, comprising both institutional and retail investors, \nneeds  to  be  broadened  and  access  to  the  debt  and  equity  markets  needs  to  be  improved. \nSubprogram 2 will support poverty reduction first by stimulating higher economic growth and \nimproving access to finance. Measures have been included to strengthen regulatory oversight of \nthe financial sector and to enhance the liquidity and the depth of the capital markets. In turn, \nincreased investor confidence and a reduction of institutional bottlenecks will allow institutions to \nmobilize  savings  and  redirect  these  funds  to  a  wider  variety  of  profitable  investments.  As  a \nconsequence, rates of savings and private investment will increase over time leading to higher \neconomic growth and poverty reduction.14 Subprogram 2 includes measures to improve the flow of \ncredit, particularly for small businesses, as well as measures to strengthen the rural banking \nsector, which provides a primary source of credit to the poor in the Philippines. Subprogram 2 will \nalso alleviate poverty indirectly through measures to enhance financial sector stability.  \n \n40.  Subprogram 2 will provide some gender benefits (Category 3), as it is likely to provide direct \nand substantial benefits to women in improving access to financial resources and opportunities. \nWhile no specific measures have been included to direct credit or credit-related services to women, \nit is anticipated that women will benefit both directly and indirectly from an enabling environment \nprovided by the reforms supported by subprogram 2. For example, the program has the capability \nto benefit women directly through their high levels of business ownership in the informal and micro \nsectors. Indirect benefits are also expected to accrue to women by enhancing credit availability to \nbusinesses in the professional and technical sectors, in which women participate to a larger degree \nthan men, and to the clients of such firms, which should raise incomes overall. \n \nC.  Safeguards \n41.  Subprogram  2  does  not  trigger  the  safeguard  policies  and  is  categorized  C  for  the \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous people. The following are agreed upon, and \nwill be incorporated in the legal agreement. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to subprogram 2. \nThe  government  agreed  to  cooperate,  and  shall  cause  any  and  all  government  offices, \norganizations, and entities involving in implementing subprogram 2 to cooperate fully with any such \ninvestigation and to extend all necessary assistance, including providing access to all relevant \nbooks and records, as may be necessary for the satisfactory completion of any such investigation. \n \nD.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n42.  Subprogram 2 remains fully aligned with the government\u2019s Medium-Term Development \nPlan, 2004\u20132010. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in the table and described \nin detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.15  \n \n \n                                                 \n14 S.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n43.  The government and the DOF have assured ADB that implementation of subprogram 2 \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in \nthe loan documents. \n \n44.  No disbursements will be made until \n \n(i)  the government transfers administrative responsibility for the SEC back to the DOF \nfrom its current location under the Department of Trade and Industry; \n(ii)  the government and the DOF, jointly with the SEC, have developed and endorsed \nan action plan to support an organizational restructure of the SEC to meet the \nobjectives described in the policy matrix; and \n(iii)  the government through DBM provides SEC with a budget increase in 2011 needed \nto support implementation of the action plan for SEC restructuring. \n \n45.  The loan will not be declared effective until the government, through the DOF, has fulfilled \nall conditions as set out in the Policy Reform Matrix in Appendix 4, with the exception of the three \n(3) conditions for loan disbursement listed above. Conditions for disbursement have been adopted \nto reflect the interrelated nature of the policy actions by the DOF, SEC and DBM and to facilitate an \nefficient application of increased budget allocations for the SEC.   \n \nV.
