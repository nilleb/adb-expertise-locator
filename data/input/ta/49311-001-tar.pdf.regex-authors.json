INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  has  requested  capacity \ndevelopment technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to enhance the \nquality and effectiveness of public employment services through a national pilot project for the \nstandardization of public employment services in Jiaozuo, Henan Province. Following a fact-\nfinding mission in March 2016, ADB and the government reached an understanding on the \nobjectives, scope, implementation arrangements, costs, and terms of reference for consultants. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country \noperations business plan, 2016\u20132018 for the PRC.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The government assigns high priority to the establishment and improvement of the urban \nand  rural  public  employment  service  system.  With  the  economy  undergoing  fundamental \ntransformation and its growth slowing, the government anticipates a large number of layoffs and \nhidden unemployment caused by overcapacity and an increase in loss-making industries and \nenterprises. On the other hand, new urban jobs are expected to be created by the drive for \u201cnew \nurbanization,\u201d which aims to integrate rural migrant workers in emerging small- and medium-\nsized cities.3 Against this background, the government\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020 \nemphasizes the leading role of public employment services in providing coordinated support to \npromote stable employment, especially for those who frequently face difficulties in labor market \ntransitions, including college graduates, rural migrant workers, laid-off workers, the unemployed, \nand foreign university graduates.4 \n \n3.  Public employment services in the PRC, by statute, have to provide a comprehensive \nset of functions, such as job brokerage, labor market information, active labor market programs, \nadministration and management of unemployment benefits, administration of other benefits, and \nlabor migration. The remaining tasks are to equalize public employment services across the \ncountry,  particularly  between  urban  and  rural  areas,  and  to  improve  service  quality  and \neffectiveness. A TA consultant\u2019s report in 2008 indicated the following challenges in the PRC\u2019s \npublic employment service system: (i) development of public employment service agencies is \nuneven,  especially  in  the  villages;  (ii)  comprehensive  services  are  not  always  provided; \n(iii) information  services  are  insufficient  due  to  underdevelopment  of  information  systems; \n(iv) service procedures and methods are inflexible; (v) results of public employment services are \noften found to be unsatisfactory; (vi) performance orientation in public employment service \nagencies is lacking; and (vii) coordination among different levels and between urban and rural \nareas is ineffective.5 Although considerable improvements have been made, these challenges \npersist to this day. \n \n4.  In 2012, the National Standardization Management Commission and 26 other central \ncommissions, ministries, and agencies issued the Notification of Social Management and Public \nService Standardization to enhance service quality and public satisfaction, and equalize basic \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 30 March 2016. \n2  ADB. 2016.

Manila (TA 4858-PRC). \n ", " 2 \npublic services.6 The notification urged the National Standardization Management Commission, \ntogether  with  local  governments  and  central  ministries  and  agencies,  to  launch  national \nstandardization  pilot  projects  in  11  social  management  and  public  service  areas.  Public \nemployment services was one of the 11 areas in which Dalian, Jiaozuo, and Kunming public \nemployment service agencies were selected as national pilot projects. \n \n5.  Located in northwestern Henan Province, Jiaozuo is a prefecture-level municipality with \na  population  of  3.68  million.  This  resource-exhausted  municipality  is  undergoing  critical \ndevelopment  (industrialization,  urbanization,  agricultural  modernization,  and  development  of \ntelecommunications infrastructure) as a provincial-level economic transformation demonstration \ncity.7 The equalization of basic public services is an urgent task as a demonstration city. Since \n2014, the Labor Exchange Center of the Jiaozuo Municipal Bureau of Human Resources and \nSocial  Security  (LEC)  has  been  implementing,  in  collaboration  with  the  Henan  Provincial \nDepartment  of  Human  Resources  and  Social  Security,  a  national  pilot  project  for  the \nstandardization of public employment services to enhance the quality and effectiveness of its \nservices as well as those in 11 district and/or county centers, 102 township stations, and \n1,826 village stations that it supervises. \n \n6.  As of February 2016, the LEC had developed 179 standards that fall into four categories: \n(i) basic common standards, (ii) service standards, (iii) management system standards, and \n(iv) public employment service staff job descriptions. Despite the significant progress,  the \nJiaozuo  national  pilot  project  faces  challenges.  Standards  for  services  and  management \nfunctions involving information technology (IT) have remained incomplete due to a low level of \nIT usage at the LEC. The midterm evaluation conducted in February 2016 found that the \nstandards developed are not high enough to enhance service quality and effectiveness. The \nservice  standards  developed  are  mostly  procedural,  without  specifying  service  results  and \nperformance characteristics. Standards concerning the profiling of clients and the targeting of \nmeasures,  two  of  the  techniques  used  to  improve  the  match  between  job  seekers  and \nemployers,  are  almost nonexistent,  partly  because  critical  labor market  information  and IT \nsystems are unavailable. The management system standards developed, on the other hand, \nfailed to cover quality control systems. Standards for district and/or county centers and for \ntownship and village stations have yet to be developed. \n \n7.  In 2014, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security issued a notification of \nmeasures to strengthen records and document management at public employment service \nagencies.  On  a  daily  basis,  these  agencies  create,  reference,  and  archive  records  and \ndocuments of those who wish to register or have registered as  job seekers. In the PRC, \nregistered  job  seekers  include  those  who  are  inactive  and  employed;  their  records  and \ndocuments are kept at public employment service agencies throughout their lifetimes. Service \ncharges  for  maintaining  personal  records  and  documents  at  public  employment  service \nagencies  were  abolished  in  2015.  Although  standards  concerning  records  and  document \nmanagement have been developed, they need to be upgraded to take into account relevant \nrequirements and standards. \n \n8.  The Jiaozuo national pilot project will close in April 2017. For the standards developed \nunder the project to be adopted at the national level, substantial work remains to be done. \n                                                \n6  Government of the PRC, National Standardization Management Commission and 26 other central commissions, \nministries, and agencies. 2012.

Additionally, the LEC\u2019s experience in implementing a national pilot \nproject should be summarized and recommended for nationwide dissemination. \n \n9.  The TA supports the government\u2019s efforts to safeguard and improve living standards, \none of the major tasks for economic and social development identified in the Thirteenth Five-\nYear  Plan  (footnote  4),  by  enhancing  the  quality  and  effectiveness  of  public  employment \nservices in rural and urban areas. This TA is built on findings and recommendations of the past \nTA projects on public employment services for disadvantaged people and information systems \nfor  employment  and  social  security  services.8 The  TA  is  linked  directly  to  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 for the PRC, which emphasizes inclusive economic growth \nthrough the reduction of rural\u2013urban disparities and the promotion of equal access to services.9 \nThe TA adds value to current and upcoming lending operations for urban and urban\u2013rural \ndevelopment, which include support for public employment services. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be the equalization of public employment services between urban and \nrural areas. The outcome will be the enhancement of the quality and effectiveness of public \nemployment services. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will have three outputs: (i) a complete set of standards for public employment \nservices developed, (ii) standards application and quality control systems for public employment \nservices  established,  and  (iii)  knowledge  about  the  standardization  of  public  employment \nservices strengthened. \n \n12.  Output 1: A complete set of standards for public employment services developed. \nThe TA will assist the LEC in improving the existing standards and developing new standards \nfor public employment services. Output 1 will include (i) collecting and reviewing all national and \nlocal legislation, requirements, and standards (including industry standards) relevant to public \nemployment  services,  which  should  be  reflected  in  the  standards  for  public  employment \nservices;  (ii)  reviewing  profiling  and  targeting  techniques  used  in  the  PRC  and  abroad; \n(iii) upgrading  existing  service  standards  by  specifying  service  results  and  performance \ncharacteristics; (iv) developing new service standards; (v) reviewing quality control systems \nused in public and private sector organizations in the PRC and abroad; (vi) upgrading existing \nmanagement system standards; (vii) reviewing records and document management systems in \nthe PRC and abroad; (viii) upgrading existing standards concerning records and documents of \nregistered job seekers at public employment service agencies; (ix) reviewing public employment \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2006.

Output 1 will be developed in two phases. During months 2\u20134, various reviews will be \nconducted to help guide standard upgrading and development, and international study visits to \nADB member countries will be organized. During months 5\u20138, the existing standards will be \nupgraded and new standards will be developed. \n \n14.  Output  2:  Standards  application  and  quality  control  systems  for  public \nemployment services established. The TA will support the training of public employment \nservice  staff  at  the  municipal,  district  and/or  county,  township,  and  village  levels  on  the \napplication  of  the  standards  developed.  About  10  public  employment  service  staff  at  the \nmunicipal level will be trained first as master trainers, making them knowledgeable about the \napplication  of  the  standards.  These  master  trainers  will  then  be  responsible  for  training \n5,000 staff at the district and/or county, township, and village levels. The TA will also support the \ndevelopment of an IT platform for public employment services (software, databases, and web \nportal), which  will be integrated with social security information systems. The platform will \ninclude functions to collect labor market information, conduct analysis for profiling and targeting, \nand carry out user satisfaction surveys. Business analysis will be performed during months 2\u20134, \ntogether with the reviews under output 1. The IT platform for public employment services will \nthen be developed in months 5\u201312. \n \n15.  Output 3: Knowledge about the standardization of public employment services \nstrengthened. The TA will support the development of case studies and the organization of \nworkshops to disseminate the standards and case studies at the provincial and national levels. \nRepresentatives of the Dalian and Kunming national pilot projects (para. 4) will be invited to the \nworkshops  to  share  knowledge  about,  and  experiences  with,  the  standardization  of  public \nemployment services. \n \n16.  The  key  risks  in  developing  the  outputs  and  achieving  the  expected  outcome  are \n(i) constraints on municipal, district and/or county, township, and village public employment \nservice agencies in terms of resources and other emerging priorities; and (ii) the introduction of \nnew types of services that might make it difficult to complete the whole set of standards for \npublic employment services. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, and other in-kind \ncontributions, including administrative support and interpretation services, logistics, and local \n(city) transportation. The government will also cover any recurrent costs required to maintain the \nIT platform during and after the TA. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.   The Henan Finance Bureau will be the executing agency and will oversee coordination \nof different departments and agencies involved in the standardization of public employment \nservices. The implementing agency will be the Jiaozuo Municipal Bureau of Human Resources \n ", "  5 \nand  Social  Security,  which  will  assume  overall  responsibility  for  the  TA  activities  in  close \ncooperation with the Henan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security. \nA project steering committee will be established to provide overall guidance and support for TA \nimplementation. This committee will be chaired by the division director of the Henan Provincial \nDepartment of Human Resources and Social Security and will comprise representatives from \nthe Henan Provincial Department of Finance, the Department of Human Resources and Social \nSecurity  (Division  of  Programming  and  Finance,  Data  Center),  the  Bureau  of  Quality  and \nTechnical  Supervision,  and  the  LEC.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  from  31  May  2016  to \n31 December 2017. Proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Procurement of \nequipment will be carried out in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2015, as \namended from time to time). Purchased equipment will be turned over to the executing agency \nupon completion of the TA activities. \n \n19.   The TA will engage two consulting firms to (i) provide expertise in good practices of \npublic employment services in the PRC and abroad, profiling and targeting, quality control \nsystems, and records and document management (international, 2 person-months; national, \n11 person-months);  and  (ii)  develop  the  IT  platform  (national,  46  person-months).  The \nconsulting firms will be selected using the quality- and cost-based selection method (with a \n90:10 quality\u2013cost ratio) and the simplified technical proposal. In addition, one international \nconsultant will be engaged for 2 person-months as an individual consultant to provide expertise \nin public service standardization. All consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The outline terms \nof reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n20.  The IT platform will be integrated with the existing social security information systems \nmanaged by the data centers of the Henan Provincial Department of Human Resources and \nSocial Security and the Jiaozuo Municipal Bureau of Human Resources and Social Security. \nThe data centers will be responsible for maintaining the IT platform developed under the TA with \nfunding from the Henan provincial government. \n \n21.  The TA will be monitored and evaluated based on the implementation of activities and \nsatisfactory  delivery  of  outputs  following  the  agreed  timeline  and  budget.  The  TA  review \nmissions will be the main mechanism to monitor and assess the TA. To support monitoring and \nevaluation, the consultants will submit an inception report, an interim report, a draft final report, \nand a final report in English and Chinese to the executing and implementing agencies, and to \nADB. \n \n22.  Under output 3, case studies on the standardization of public employment services by \nthe LEC, as implemented under the national pilot project, will be prepared and disseminated \ntogether with the standards developed at provincial and national level workshops. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Jiaozuo National Pilot Project for the \nStandardization of Public Employment Services, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n  DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \nPublic employment services between urban and rural areas equalized (Notification of Social Management and Public \nService Standardization)a  \nPerformance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome       \nThe quality and  a.
