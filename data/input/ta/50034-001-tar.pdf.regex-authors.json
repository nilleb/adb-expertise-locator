INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the 2015 country program mission, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide policy and advisory \ntechnical assistance (TA) to the Gansu Provincial Education Department (GPED) for Vocational \nEducation\u2013Enterprise  Collaboration  for  Student  Employment-Based  Poverty  Reduction  in \nGansu. ADB included the proposed TA in its PRC country operations business plan, 2016\u2013\n2018.1 ADB conducted a fact-finding mission on 26\u201329 July 2016 and reached an agreement \nwith the government on the impact, outcome, outputs, terms of reference for consultants, cost \nestimates, financing plan, and implementation arrangements. ADB approved the TA concept \npaper on 22 August 2016. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Nearly three decades of rapid growth and poverty reduction planning have dramatically \nreduced  rural  poverty  in  the  PRC.  However,  existing  poverty  reduction  planning  requires \nadditional approaches to better target, track, and address the changing needs of specific groups \nof rural poor amid significant socioeconomic change. \n \n3.  For  example,  the  PRC\u2019s  rural  poverty  reduction  program  has  focused  on  income \nimprovement through enhanced agricultural production and rural infrastructure since the mid-\n1980s. Its education activities have centered on training farmers, building schools, and providing \nsubsidies for poor students enrolled in the PRC\u2019s nine-year compulsory education program. \nEmployment generation has been supported through microcredit to farmer enterprises and the \norganized export of off-farm manual labor to other localities. Linkages to other government \nagencies and programs have mainly occurred at the project operational and funding levels \nrather than through integrated policy creation and interagency activity coordination. \n \n4.  However, broader and better-targeted poverty reduction measures are needed given (i) \nthe rapid rates of out-migration and urbanization, particularly of rural youth; (ii) structural reform \nin economic sectors; (iii) the changing roles of government and enterprises; and (iv) industry \ntechnical upgrades and relocation. \n \n5.  The need for a new framework is apparent in youth poverty reduction, where the poverty \nreduction through education concept has gained policy momentum, including technical and \nvocational education and training (TVET) and education\u2013enterprise cooperation. TVET-based \npoverty  reduction  aims  to  break  the  geographic  concentration  and  intergenerational \ntransmission of rural poverty through improved (i) training and soft skilling of poor rural students \nfor the broader national economy, and (ii) management of their initial employment stability and \nincome  security.  The  concept  necessitates  closer  and  more  mutually  beneficial  TVET\u2013\nenterprise  collaborations,  and  stronger  policy  and  programming  coordination  between \ngovernment agencies for TVET and poverty reduction. \n \n6.  Initial state-level steps on poverty reduction through education have included issuing \nguidance  for  poverty  reduction  and  related  agencies  to  \u201cincrease  the  relevance  and \neffectiveness of training by orienting it toward employment, strengthening vocational training \nprograms,  encouraging  businesses  to  combine  poverty  reduction  efforts  with  vocational \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2016. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2016\u20132018. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 25 August 2016. \n ", "2 \neducation, and encouraging vocational schools to admit more applicants from poor families.\u201d3 \nThe PRC\u2019s Ministry of Education (MOE) has also begun pilot testing a modern apprenticeship \nsystem  in  which  (i) junior  and  senior TVET  schools  and  enterprises jointly  recruit  student \napprentices under a training agreement and labor contract; (ii) TVET teachers and enterprise \nprofessionals  jointly  train  student  apprentices  using  a  codeveloped  training  plan,  teaching \nmaterials, and enterprise worker training funds; and (iii) local government education authorities \nuse monitoring mechanisms to ensure the rights and responsibilities of contracting parties.4 This \nsystem is in line with current macro-structural reforms to better define and delineate the roles of \ngovernment, market, and society. It also aims to address some micro-level problems of previous \nstudent  internships,  which  are  now  covered  by  new  administrative  measures.5 MOE  is \nencouraging the pilot scheme localities to develop detailed implementation plans, interagency \nworking groups, coordination methods, and stakeholder responsibilities; and to explore different \nstudent development modalities. \n \n7.  As one of the country\u2019s poorest provinces, Gansu in western PRC has been exploring \nways to reduce rural poverty in its ecologically fragile regions. The province had 5.32 million \nrural poor in 2015 and the second-highest subnational rural poverty incidence during 2010\u2013\n2014. Three of the 14 nationally designated zones of concentrated poverty cover parts of Gansu \n(the Liupan Mountain zone, the Qinba Mountain zone, and the Four Province Contiguous Poor \nTibetan Area zone), and 58 of Gansu\u2019s 75 national-level poor counties fall within these three \nzones. \n \n8.  Gansu\u2019s experience registering poor households and issuing poverty cards to improve \nbenefit targeting and tracking was recognized nationally in 2016. This system can provide a \nbasis for improved targeting and tracking of poor students. In 2016, GPED included in its tasks \nintegrating TVET\u2013enterprise resources, increasing cooperation, and pilot testing a provincial-\nlevel modern apprenticeship scheme in 17 TVET schools to promote poverty reduction and \neducation reform.6 However, experience in Gansu also indicates that (i) some students doubt \n                                                \n3  Government of the PRC, Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council. 2015.

Provisions  on \nAdministration of Internships of Students of Vocational Schools. Beijing (Document No. 3; original document issued \nand made effective on 11 April in Chinese). The measures aim to better protect senior high- and college-level \nvocational school interns and to reduce labor abuses that drew public attention in 2012\u20132013. Key clauses are that \n(i) vocational schools fielding interns must be given access to the hiring enterprise\u2019s premises to assess its worker \nhealth and safety conditions, basic enterprise information, and the intern\u2019s role and function; (ii) the vocational \nschool, enterprise, and the potential intern (interns under 18 years of age require the consent of a legal guardian) \nare to reach a tripartite agreement, including on the type of work to be undertaken and the liability for breach of \nagreement; (iii) interns cannot exceed 10% of the enterprise\u2019s total labor force and 20% of the labor force in \nspecific positions; (iv) the internship will normally be for 6 months; (v) student interns will not be allocated to \nenterprises that do not sign internship agreements complying with requirements; (vi) student interns should not  (a) \nwork on legally designated leave time or holidays, overtime, or the night shift; (b) work in bars, nightclubs, music \nhalls, spa centers, or other such entertainment enterprises; or (c) arrange their internships through intermediary or \nfee-for-service  organizations;  (vii)  in  principle,  intern  remuneration  shall  exceed  80%  of  the  salary  of  new \nemployees on probation in the same position; and (viii) the vocational school and internship enterprise will cover \nstudent internship insurance following national regulations. Provinces, ethnic autonomous regions, and national \nmunicipalities are preparing implementing rules for the provisions. Those for Gansu have been completed. \n6  Government of the PRC, GPED and Provincial Party Higher Education Institute Work Committee. 2016. Notice on \nKey Points in the 2016 Work Plan. Lanzhou (issued on 4 March). \n \n \n ", "3 \nthe value of TVET, given its unstable and low-paying job outcomes; (ii) some local enterprises \nlack  enthusiasm  and  incentives  to  engage  with  the  scheme;  and  (iii)  local  GPED  student \ntracking capacity is weak. \n \n9.  Thus, both challenges and opportunities exist to pilot and refine TVET\u2013enterprise-based \nstudent poverty reduction in Gansu and to potentially form a framework for sharing with other \npoor localities in western PRC. A 2015 PRC presidential mandate to eliminate absolute poverty \nby 2020 has intensified the need for such innovative strategies and fostered a more receptive \npolicy environment. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The  impact  will  be  a  more  effective  national  framework  for  TVET-based  poverty \nreduction.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  TVET\u2013enterprise  collaboration  for  student \nemployment-based poverty reduction. This will be evident from (i) GPED\u2019s adoption of a TVET\u2013\nenterprise framework of guidelines and procedures, and a gender-sensitive training manual for \nstudent  employment-based  poverty  reduction;  and  (ii)  the  operation  of  a  new  provincial \neducation and poverty reduction agency co-programming modality for TVET-based poverty \nreduction in Gansu. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will undertake gender-sensitive policy analysis, multi-stakeholder surveys, in-\ndepth  field  interviews,  consultations,  gender-disaggregated  data  collection,  TVET  trainee \ntracking  (from  admission  to  completion  or  certification  and  then  job  placement),  domestic \nexperience exchanges, and a domestic study tour to achieve four outputs.7 \n \n12.  Output  1:  Experience  in  technical  and  vocational  education  and  training\u2013\nenterprise collaboration for student employment-based poverty reduction reviewed. The \nTA  will  analyze  (i)  PRC  and  international  policies  and  practices;  (ii)  gender-disaggregated \neducation, employment, internship, and apprenticeship data; monitoring reports; and poverty \ncard records; and (iii) good practices observed during a domestic study tour. \n \n13.  Output  2:  Poverty  reduction  capacity  of  the  Gansu  technical  and  vocational \neducation and training modern apprenticeship scheme assessed. The TA will design and \nconduct well-targeted surveys, interviews, and small group discussions with TVET teachers, \ncareer advisors, poor students (and their families) from the 17 TVET schools in the modern \napprenticeship system pilot, relevant industry and charitable associations, public and private \nsector enterprises, and labor recruitment organizations within Gansu and Tianjin, Gansu\u2019s East\u2013\nWest Poverty Reduction partner metropolis in eastern PRC. \n \n                                                \n7 The initial proposal is for surveys to be conducted in schools in the poor Gansu cities of Dingxi, Longnan, Pingliang, \nand Wuwei; in Gannan (Tibetan) and Linxia (Hui Muslim) ethnic prefectures; and in Lanzhou city schools that \nprovide free junior TVET for Tibetan students. These constitute a subset of the 17 TVET schools in the MOE \nmodern apprenticeship system pilot in Gansu. Of those 17, 14 are province-level pilot schools and three are \nnational-level schools, representing 10 junior and seven senior TVET schools. Under this TA, an additional school \nwas added in Gannan (Tibetan) and in Linxia (Hui Muslim) ethnic prefectures to ensure an ethnically diverse \nsample. It is anticipated that TVET schools not selected for survey would still participate in some TA activities. \n \n ", "4 \n14.  Output  3:  Technical  and  vocational  education  and  training\u2013enterprise \ncollaboration framework for student employment-based poverty reduction developed. \nThe TA will develop implementation guidelines, procedures, monitoring criteria and indicators, \nsample  TVET\u2013enterprise  agreements  and  student\u2013enterprise  employment  contracts,  and  a \ngender-sensitive training manual that outlines (i) mechanisms for training staff and contracting \nstudents,  (ii)  new  incentives  such  as  ranking  and  resourcing  TVET  schools  based  on  an \nemployment rating of graduates, and (iii) monitoring criteria and indicators. \n \n15.  Output 4: Knowledge about the Gansu technical and vocational education and \ntraining\u2013enterprise  collaboration  framework  for  student  employment-based  poverty \nreduction  strengthened.  The  TA  will  assist  GPED  in  documenting  good  practices  and \nrecommendations  for  TVET\u2013enterprise  collaboration  in  a  bilingual  policy  brief,  knowledge \nproduct, media articles, and four subreports on TVET schools, international and PRC TVET\u2013\nenterprise  experiences,  and  poor  TVET  students  and  their  families.  Findings  will  be \ndisseminated  through  stakeholder  workshops,  a  northwestern  PRC  experience  exchange \nmeeting, and a national poverty reduction conference. \n \n16.  Potential risks affecting achievements include (i) an unanticipated decline in student \nemployment opportunities within collaborating enterprises, (ii) slow implementation progress as \nenterprises and TVET schools doubt the benefits of collaboration, and (iii) inadequate statistics \nfor an accurate and gender-based analysis. The TA will minimize risks by involving industry \nassociations in regular stakeholder meetings and compiling supplementary statistics. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $800,000 equivalent, of which $400,000 equivalent will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). \nThe government will provide counterpart support to finance the TA office and equipment (e.g., \ncomputers),  office  communication,  remuneration  and  per  diem  for  counterpart  staff,  and \nsubsidies for eligible poor Gansu students at junior and technical schools within the province. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  GPED will be the executing agency. The TA will be implemented from 1 November 2016 \nto 31 December 2018. \n \n19.  In consultation with GPED, ADB will recruit one international and six national consultants \nfor a total of 44 person-months over 23 months using individual consultant selection procedures, \nand will consider lump-sum payments and/or output-based contracts in line with the Midterm \nReview of Strategy 2020 action plan.8 Recruitment will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time).  \n \n20.  A national expert in PRC technical education\u2013enterprise collaboration will (i) act as the \nteam leader and assume overall responsibility for writing and disseminating a bilingual policy \nbrief, the TA completion report, and a subreport on PRC TVET\u2013enterprise cooperation; and (ii) \noversee the team analysis of policies and data, survey design and implementation, stakeholder \ninterviews, fieldwork and knowledge dissemination plans, international and national workshops, \ndomestic study tour, and project training (12 person-months). A national technical education \nspecialist will (i) collect gender-disaggregated data on Gansu TVET schools and students; (ii) \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2014.

A national poverty reduction \npolicy and planning specialist will (i) analyze government data on household poverty cards, (ii) \nconduct interviews with poverty reduction agencies and poor rural TVET students and their \nfamilies, and (iii) prepare a subreport and recommendations on the education-based poverty \nreduction policy initiatives and charitable activities of enterprises and society, including the \nTianjin\u2013Gansu  East\u2013West  Poverty  Reduction  Partnership9 (8  person-months).  A  national \nparticipatory rural poverty reduction and training specialist will (i) conduct a capacity, training, \nand soft-skilling needs assessment for government agencies, enterprises, and poverty card-\nholding  students  interested  in  equity-oriented  technical  education\u2013enterprise  activities;  (ii) \nprepare a gender-sensitive Gansu modern vocational education apprenticeship scheme training \nmanual with stakeholder group participation; and (iii) train participants and trainers of trainers in \nits use (7 person-months). A national legal advisor on contract law will develop improved TVET \nschool\u2013enterprise training agreements and individual student\u2013enterprise contracts, and provide \nrelated training (1 person-month). An international expert on inclusive and equitable TVET\u2013\nenterprise  collaboration  will  research  and  report  on  international  policies,  incentives,  and \nexperiences in TVET\u2013enterprise cooperation for student poverty reduction (3 person-months). A \nnational  administrative  and  financial  assistant  will  assist  with  logistics,  including  fieldwork, \nmeetings,  and  dissemination  planning  (5  person-months).  ADB  will  engage  up  to  10 \ninterviewers for the TVET survey, TVET\u2013enterprise cooperation survey, and poor TVET student \nand household survey on a short-term basis under team leader supervision. \n \n21.  The experts will provide inputs as consultants and short-term resource persons. ADB will \nfinalize the terms of reference for resource persons and specific tasks for the experts, including \ntheir duration and expected results. TA proceeds will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n22.  GPED and the provincial poverty reduction agency will convene quarterly coordination \nmeetings to identify, track, and update overall TA progress, and will ensure timely TA outputs \nand  effective  dissemination.  Policy  and  stakeholder  dialogue  will  be  maintained,  including \nthrough routine TA advisory group and stakeholder meetings to ensure field-level feedback and \npolicy relevance. Stakeholders will conduct self-evaluations in a concluding quarterly meeting. \n \n23.  ADB and GEPD will disseminate good practices and lessons learned in a policy brief, \ncompletion report, subreports, study tour report, a gender-sensitive training manual, improved \ncontracts and agreement templates, and monitoring criteria and indicators. GEPD will provide \nTA findings and knowledge products to national and Gansu leadership for consideration in \nimplementing new policies, pilot tests, and processes. GPED will issue government guidance on \npromoting school\u2013enterprise cooperation and circulate copies to institutions for implementation. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China for Vocational Education\u2013Enterprise Collaboration for Student \nEmployment-Based Poverty Reduction in Gansu, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n9 The PRC government has paired wealthier eastern and poorer western areas as a poverty reduction policy since \n1996.
