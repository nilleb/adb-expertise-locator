INTRODUCTION \n1.  Demand for energy across the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) has risen strongly, \noften at a rate outpacing economic growth in the region, and is expected to triple in the next 15\u2013\n20 years.1 In particular, the demand for electricity is growing rapidly, which will require a major \nexpansion of the power system. According to the power development plans (PDPs) of the GMS \ncountries, total regional installed capacity is projected to nearly double by 2025, mostly through \nincreased hydro and coal-fired power generation capacity.2 Therefore, associated environmental \nand social pressures are expected to intensify with increased climate change-related concerns.3  \n \n2.  Balancing power sector development with environmental and social concerns can be \naddressed from the outset in the PDP planning process by internalizing environmental and \nsocial impacts through strategic environmental assessment (SEA)4 and by examining all supply- \nand demand-side options to select an integrated set of least-cost resources that meet the \nforecasted  electricity  demand  through  integrated  resource  planning  (IRP).5 This  technical \nassistance (TA) is designed to (i) enhance the capacity of GMS countries to use IRP and SEAs \nin their PDPs; and (ii) as necessary, and as validated through the IRP (a) improve regulations, \npolicies, programs, and/or targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency; and (b) support \ncross-border  interconnections.  This  will  enable  the  GMS  countries  to  achieve  greater \nsustainability  in  power  sector  development.6 This  TA  is  aligned  with  the  GMS  regional \ncooperation operation business plan (2013\u20132014), the GMS economic cooperation program \nstrategic framework (2012\u20132022), and the GMS regional investment framework 2013-2022.7 \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.8 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has assisted the GMS countries since 2012 to \napply SEA in the regional PDP through the regional TA.9 In this TA, three main scenarios were \nused to compare impacts and benefits: the current PDP scenario, renewable energy scenario, \n                                                \n1  It includes Cambodia, Yunnan Province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n2  ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance for Ensuring Sustainability of Greater Mekong Subregion Regional Power \nDevelopment. Manila. The technical assistance (TA) projected an increase in total installed capacity from 120 \ngigawatts (GW) in 2012 to 210 GW by 2025. Coal-fired generation capacity will double to more than 50 GW. Gas-\nfired generation capacity will increase to 24 GW. Large hydropower plants will dominate the energy mix with \napproximately 111 GW. Renewable sources, such as solar and wind, would triple from the current level of 3.5 GW. \n3  The environmental cost of energy consumption in the GMS is estimated to be $320 billion, and carbon dioxide \nemissions are projected to increase by 1,177 million tons by 2025. \n4  According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, SEA refers to a range of analytical \nand participatory approaches that aim to integrate environmental considerations into policies, plans, and programs, \nand evaluate how they link to economic and social considerations.  \n5  Compared to the traditional least-cost planning that considers only limited supply options, IRP can achieve lower \noverall costs, more fuel savings, and less negative environmental and social impacts. \n6  The World Commission on Environment and Development in 1987 defined sustainability as development that \nmeets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. In \nthis document, sustainability means economic, environmental, and social sustainability. \n7  ADB. 2012. Regional Cooperation Operations Business Plan: Greater Mekong Subregion: 2013\u20132014. Manila; \nADB. 2011. Greater Mekong Subregion Economic Cooperation Program Strategic Framework, 2012\u20132022. Manila; \n  ADB. 2014. Greater Mekong Subregion Economic Cooperation Program: Regional Investment Framework Pipeline \nof Potential Projects (2013\u20132022). Manila. \n8  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 September 2015. \n9 The TA (footnote 2) was approved in 2010 in the amount of 1,000,000 euros ($1,350,000 equivalent at the time) \nfrom the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD).  \n ", "2   \nand energy efficiency scenario. These indicated the alternative renewable energy and energy \nefficiency scenarios resulted in greater benefits and enhanced the sustainability of the PDP. For \nsustainable power sector development, therefore, the study recommended that: (i) responsible \nagencies should ensure demand forecasts are accurate and realistic; (ii) governments should \nstrengthen  policies,  programs,  and  targets  to  increase  energy  efficiency  throughout  the \neconomy; and (iii) in future PDPs, governments should increase the contribution made by \nrenewable energy in the power generation mix.  \n  \n4.  In  parallel,  ADB  has  assisted  the  GMS  countries  to  understand  and  promote  the \npotential of renewable energy and energy efficiency in the region through the regional TA.10 This \nTA study revealed a significant potential for solar and wind power development and energy \nsavings in the GMS; exploiting these will reduce the dependence of the GMS countries on \nimported fuels and enhance their development of green economies. Increased use of renewable \nenergy  can  reduce  dependence  on  imported  fuels,  lower  carbon  dioxide  emissions,  and \nincrease options for distributed grid development in remote areas (in contrast to a centralized, \nlarge-scale power system). Improved energy efficiency and demand-side management (DSM) \ncan lower power demand by shifting and flattening peak loads,  thereby increasing energy \nsavings. Despite the potential of renewable energy and energy efficiency, however, their use in \nthe GMS has been limited, due in part to the limitations of the conventional PDP process, the \ntechnical  features  of  the  modeling  software,  and/or  lack  of  pertinent  data  to  incorporate \ntechnical characteristics of distributed generation and DSM measures. It is evident that it is \neasier to model a few larger power plants than to model hundreds of smaller, intermittent \nrenewable energy power plants and/or energy-efficiency and DSM measures. \n \n5.  ADB has also helped the GMS countries to develop a common vision of integrated grid \noperations and regional power market development. The Regional Power Trade Coordination \nCommittee (RPTCC) was established in 2002, and consists of representatives from the energy \nministries and power utilities in each GMS country. An intergovernmental memorandum of \nunderstanding to establish the Regional Power Coordination Center was signed in 2012. Cross-\nborder  interconnections  (i)  enable  the  optimal  use  of  generation  sources  through  lower \ncombined reserve requirements, and reduction of peak generation capacity; and (ii) improve \nelectricity reliability by enabling more flexible responses to unpredictable events, such as power \noutages. Expansion of power availability through interconnections can also absorb additional \nintermittent  generation,  mitigating  the  risk  of  frequency  and  voltage  control  problems,  and \nsignificantly lowering backup capacity costs. However, the benefits of increased cross-border \ninterconnections are not fully evaluated and considered in the existing PDPs of GMS countries.   \n \n6.  The  outcomes  of  these  TA  projects  indicate  that  the  PDP  process  can  be  further \nimproved by introducing IRP, which (i) evaluates all options of the supply side (conventional \npower systems, distributed and grid-connected renewable energy systems, and cross-border \ninterconnection)  and  demand  side  (energy  efficiency,  DSM,  and  demand-side  response \nmeasures); while (ii) applying the SEA to internalize environmental and social impacts. In this \nregard, IRP and SEA need to be fully integrated in a consultative PDP process, with relevant \nministries, agencies, and other stakeholders involved in developing and evaluating alternatives.   \n \n7.  While there is an advantage in applying various tools, such as IRP and SEA, in the PDP \nprocess, their application requires that a country\u2019s power sector have the following attributes: (i) \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance for Promoting Renewable Energy, Clean Fuels, and Energy Efficiency in the \nGreater Mekong Subregion. Manila.  \n ", "  3 \na strong grid system that can accommodate an increased share of renewable energy; (ii) a \nmodernized distribution system with smart-grid applications, such as demand-side aggregators, \nsmart  meters,  and  real-time  pricing;  (iii)  a  policy  and  regulatory  environment  that  has \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguards,  national  targets  for  renewable  energy  and  energy \nefficiency, and climate change mitigation measures; and (iv) a clear road map to make tariffs \ncost-reflective and introduce a time-of-use tariff system. Among the GMS countries, Viet Nam is \nmoving in this direction, especially through its power sector reforms, and was the only country \nable to apply the SEA in its PDP at the country level during implementation of the previous \nregional TA because of the extensive data requirements. Viet Nam has expressed the need to \nfurther enhance its SEA capacity. \n \n8.  ADB  has  been  a  lead  development  agency  on  GMS  energy  cooperation,  and  has \nsupported key GMS regional studies on the energy sector,11 regional interconnection,12 a regional \nmaster plan,13 and an energy sector assessment;14 and institutional development for regional \npower trade since 1992.15 Other development partners have also made significant contributions. \nThe  World  Bank  has  financed  several  studies  concerning  interconnected  power  market \ninfrastructure, such as regional studies on power trade strategy,16 and GMS power trade market \nstructure.17 The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency provided $5 million to \ncofinance ADB TA projects to support studies on the regional master plan for interconnection. \nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) provided cofinancing of $1,200,000 to develop the \nGMS energy sector strategy in 2006. Thereafter, AFD and ADB signed a cofinancing agreement \non 14 December 2011, which committed \u20ac2,000,000 for SEA support separated into two phases. \nThe proposed TA is the second phase of SEA assistance agreed to by ADB and AFD. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA impact will be a more economically, environmentally, and socially sustainable \npower sector developed for greater mitigation of climate change impacts in the GMS. The TA \noutcome will be strengthened power sector planning in GMS countries using IRP and SEA. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will primarily focus on Viet Nam\u2019s PDP process by applying IRP with SEA, and \ncapturing the progress and lessons from Viet Nam as a knowledge product to share with other \ncountries to enhance their PDP processes. Some GMS countries have good experiences in \ntackling the technical and regulatory challenges associated with increasing renewable energy \nand implementing energy efficiency, which can be shared across the region.18 The TA activities \n                                                \n11  ADB. 1995.

The People\u2019s Republic of \n \n ", "4   \nwill be closely coordinated with the GMS Environment Operations Center\u2019s Core Environment \nProgram, which has provided assistance on the SEA for power development planning in Viet \nNam.19 The TA aims to deliver the following three outputs.  \n \n11.  Output 1: Viet Nam\u2019s integrated resource planning and strategic environmental \nassessment capacity enhanced. This component will support updating or revising the Viet \nNam PDP by applying IRP with SEA.20 It will include (i) analyzing how to integrate substantially \nhigher shares of intermittent renewable energy sources into the power generation mix while \noptimizing  the  predicting,  balancing,  and  dispatching  aspects;  (ii)  assessing  how  energy \nefficiency could be treated by power utilities as a virtual generation resource in the same way as \nnew  generating  capacity,  considering  key  energy-efficiency  measures  such  as  time-of-use \ntariffs, obligation of saving to the power utility, and/or aggregation and displacement of large \nconsumers; (iii) evaluating the benefits of cross-border interconnection in terms of improved \nreliability,  reduced  reserve  margin  requirements,  and  optimized  generation  resources;  (iv) \nvalidating policies, regulations, programs, and targets for renewable energy, energy efficiency, \nand cross-border interconnections under the IRP with SEA as appropriate, and developing \nrecommendations to strengthen these; and (v) training key government officials for them to \nbecome proficient in applying IRP and SEA and building related institutional capacity. \n \n12.  Output 2: Awareness among Greater Mekong Subregion countries increased. This \ncomponent will (i) identify (a) each GMS country\u2019s institutional capacity gaps and technical \nissues in applying IRP with SEA in their national PDP processes, and (b) training needs to \nenhance power sector planning and promote renewable energy, energy efficiency and cross-\nborder interconnections in all GMS countries; (ii) tailor technical guidelines and briefing notes (in \nEnglish and in selected national languages), focusing on the country\u2013PDP process by applying \nIRP with SEA, and using Viet Nam\u2019s experience and assist other GMS countries in improving \ntheir PDP process using IRP with SEA;21 (iii) organize country workshops and training programs \non promoting renewable energy, energy efficiency, and cross-border interconnections, as well \nas improving PDP processes based on regional and international best practices for all GMS \ncountries; and (iv) provide institution-to-institution or utility-to-utility twinning support to better \nunderstand institutional development challenges and facilitate the exchange of ideas between \ncountries to improve the PDP process and promote renewable energy, energy efficiency, and \ncross-border interconnections.22 Given the diverse level of power sector development in GMS \ncountries and their readiness to apply IRP and SEA, capacity building for other GMS countries \nwill be mainly focused on applying lessons from Viet Nam\u2019s application of the IRP and SEA. \n \n                                                                                                                                                       \nChina also expressed interest in sharing its experience in developing special grid codes for renewable energy \nintegration with other GMS countries as needed. \n19 ADB. 2005.

It normally begins \nwith profiling of possible recipient and expert utilities and/or institutions, evaluating their compatibility, and clearly \ndefining their expectations in a practical work plan. The TA envisions three twinning programs and detailed plans  \nwill be developed in consultation with the countries during the TA implementation. \n ", "  5 \n13.  Output 3: Knowledge products shared. This component will support the design and \npackaging of various studies on selected topics and themes into quality knowledge products; \nstudies will be chosen based on the needs and priorities of and challenges faced by GMS \ncountries during TA implementation, and will include (i) Viet Nam\u2019s experiences in integrated \nPDP, and applying IRP with SEA; and (ii) country integrated PDP guidelines and briefing notes \n(in English and selected national languages). Quality assurance of knowledge products in local \nlanguages will be provided by the respective counterpart government and a national consultant. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,200,000, of which \u20ac1,000,000 (equivalent to $1,100,000) \nwill be financed on a grant basis by AFD and will be administered by ADB.23 The governments \nof GMS countries will provide in-kind contributions in the form of counterpart staff, office space, \nand support for local administration, knowledge generation, monitoring, and reporting services. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA and the Southeast Asia Energy Division will \noversee its implementation. Key counterparts to implement the TA are (i) each ministry or \nagency in the GMS responsible for the power sector, renewable energy, and energy efficiency; \n(ii)  national  electric  power  utilities;  and  (iii)  environmental  and  social  safeguard  regulation \nagencies, which will be arranged and coordinated through RPTCC focal ministries and utilities in \nthe GMS countries. RPTCC meetings, which have been organized twice per year under the \nGMS since 2002, will be used as the main platform for TA knowledge sharing and dissemination. \nThe  countries  will  each  be  responsible  for  providing  necessary  data  and  consultation  in \ndeveloping  alternative  PDP  scenarios  combining  renewable  energy,  energy  efficiency  and \ncross-border interconnections, and identifying and bridging institutional capacity gaps.  \n \n16.  The implementation of the TA will require 22 person-months of international consulting \ninputs and 27 person-months of national consulting inputs, which will be engaged by ADB in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime). Among these, 22 person-months of international consulting inputs and 21 person-months \nof national consulting inputs will be provided through an international consulting firm following \nthe quality-and cost-based selection method (90% quality:10% cost). The remaining 6 person-\nmonths of national consulting services will be engaged individually (a manuscript editor based in \nManila  who  will  liaise  with  ADB\u2019s  Department  of  External  Relations). TA  proceeds  will  be \ndisbursed in line with the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). The TA will be implemented from March 2016 to December 2018.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of \u20ac1,000,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement for Integrated Resource \nPlanning with Strategic Environmental Assessment for Sustainable Power Sector Development \nin the Greater Mekong Subregion, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n                                                \n23 The remaining AFD funding contribution (para. 8) totals \u20ac1 million, or approximately $1,100,000 as of October 2015.   \n ", "6     Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts of the TA is aligned with: \n \nA more economically, environmentally, and socially sustainable power sector developed for greater \nmitigation of climate change impacts in the Greater Mekong Subregion \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Indicators with  Reporting \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2019:     \n   \nPower sector  IRP and SEA used in the  Government PDPs and  Governments lack \nplanning in GMS  PDP in Viet Nam and  energy sector reports  understanding and fail \ncountries using IRP  partially in other GMS  to prioritize the \nand SEA  countries (2015 baseline: 0)  undertaking of IRP and \nstrengthened    SEA to improve their \nPDP development \nprocess. \nOutputs  By 2018:     \n1a.
