Air pollution in Asian cities is a growing concern because of rapid urban development \nand increased motorization. The World Health Organization estimates that air pollution causes \n530,000 premature deaths every year in Asia and millions of dollars in economic losses.1 While \ninformation and knowledge on air quality management (AQM) are increasingly generated in \nAsia to address this problem, the capture and transfer of this knowledge to policy makers in \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) is far from adequate, resulting in investment decisions \nthat are not always based on sound science and international best practice. This technical \nassistance  (TA)2 responds  to  DMCs\u2019  demands  and  the  operational  needs  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to improve knowledge transfer and knowledge sharing on air quality \nmanagement in the region.3  It supports the Millennium Development Goal on environmental \nsustainability.4 Furthermore, the knowledge-management activities in this TA support ADB\u2019s \nefforts to bridge the gaps in knowledge among developing countries to enable poverty reduction \nand  the  fostering  of  knowledge  development,  as  called  for  in  ADB\u2019s  long-term  strategic \nframework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020)5 and Knowledge Management Strategy.6 The TA will \nsupport a co-benefits approach to climate change mitigation in line with the general aims of the \nAsia-Pacific Gateway to Climate and Development and the Cool Earth Partnership.7 The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  ADB recognizes the importance of knowledge brokering in fighting poverty and fostering \ndevelopment and has proposed three strategic thrusts in its policy paper Toward E-development \nin Asia and the Pacific: A Strategic Approach for ICT: (i) creating an enabling environment by \nfostering the development of innovative sector policies, strengthening public institutions, and \npromoting the development of information and communications technology (ICT) facilities and \nrelated  infrastructure  networks;  (ii)  building  human  resources;  and  (iii)  developing  ICT \napplications and content.8  \n \n3.  Air quality has either improved slightly or remained stable over the past decade in many \nAsian cities, notwithstanding continued growth in urban population, energy use, greenhouse gas \n(GHG) emissions, and motorization. Progress so far in AQM usually results from the application \nof across-the-board policy measures that have been tested in many other countries worldwide, \nsuch banning leaded gasoline and introducing cleaner fuels and vehicles. For policy makers and \nother stakeholders in Asian cities to make further progress in air quality management, they will \nneed (i) better capacity to develop and implement locally designed strategies and (ii) better \naccess to international and regional knowledge and experience of AQM. \n                                                 \n1  Krzyzanowski,  Michal.  2006.

Internet usage is increasingly mainstreamed across the international community and in \ndeveloping countries and cities in Asia as an indispensable communications medium for policy \nmaking.9 The accelerated growth of broadband Internet access in Asia has brought a sharp \nincrease  in  the  availability  of  AQM  information.  Yet  this  information  is  fragmented  across \ndifferent websites. Better ways to transfer this knowledge to its intended audience and ensure \nthat it is actually applied by AQM policy makers are required.10  \n \n5.  While knowledge management and ICT tools show great potential, challenges need to \nbe  addressed  with  respect  to  its  relevance  to  AQM  in  Asia.  Multilateral  and  international \norganizations need to (i) address the current ad-hoc approach to knowledge management and \ntransfer in AQM; (ii) identify the knowledge demands and preferred mechanisms to access the \ninformation; (iii) develop a portal to provide policy makers and other stakeholders with easy \naccess to relevant AQM and related information in an organized and interactive manner; (iv) \nbuild social networks to share knowledge among cities, national governments, nongovernment \norganizations, research institutions, and the private sector; and (v) enhance stakeholders\u2019 use of \nICT for knowledge transfer and capacity building. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The  impact  of  this  TA  is  air  pollution  in  Asia  further  reduced  through  improved \nformulation and implementation of urban development, clean energy, and sustainable transport \npolicies regionally, nationally, and locally. The outcome of this TA is policy makers and the \nstakeholders who influence decisions in Asia gaining better access to AQM knowledge and \nmore effectively managing it to further policy development. \n \n7.  The TA will have the following outputs: (i) information from a regularly maintained AQM \nwebsite is incorporated in government policy documents and (ii) AQM communities of practice \nprovide an effective forum for stakeholders to share knowledge and good practices in AQM and \ncontribute  to  building  the  capacity  of  policy  makers  and  strengthening  policy  development \nprocesses.  \n \n8.  The scope of the TA covers (i) DMCs, especially in east, southeast, and south Asia \n(excluding Central Asia and the Pacific), with the target DMCs identified at the inception stage \nof the TA in consultation with regional departments; (ii) policy makers and other stakeholders \nwho influence decisions in Asia;11 and (iii) air quality in relation to urban development, clean \nenergy, climate change and sustainable transport topics, and, to some extent, transboundary \nand indoor air pollution.  \n \n                                                 \n9  The 2007 World Economic Forum in Davos, with over 2,400 participants, allowed for the first time the use of video \nblogs and webcasts for a more transparent and participatory approach to decision making. The World Economic \nForum launched a website to engage the world in the process. Available: http://www.davosconversation.org \n10 Several AQM projects have large data sets relevant to policy makers but need to be disseminated more widely. \nExamples include the Public Health and Air Pollution in Asia Program, which has built a large body of health-\nrelated information, and the Asian Regional Research Programme on Environmental Technology, which has \ncollected over 10,000 data sets while drawing up emission inventories and conducting source-apportionment \nstudies. \n11 The TA\u2019s target group within ADB consists of all staff involved in implementing the Clean Energy and Environment \nProgram, as well as other staff working on projects related to air quality. \n ", "  3\nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will focus on the collection, capture, analysis, synthesis, and transfer of AQM \nknowledge for the benefit of policy makers and will include linkages with urban development, \ncleaner energy, climate change co-benefits, and sustainable transport. The TA will run from \nJanuary 2009 to October 2010, with regional, national, and local activities. The continuation of \nactivities will be sustained beyond October 2010 through the communities of practice (COPs) \nand the Clean Air Initiative for Asian Cities (CAI-Asia) Center. \n \n10.  The following activities are planned in support of the two outputs: \n(i)  Maintenance of an AQM knowledge portal.12 The TA will establish an online \nportal to capture, analyze, synthesize, and disseminate knowledge tailored to the \nneeds of government policy makers in AQM and GHG mitigation and of other \nstakeholders who influence their decisions. Consultations and surveys will be \nconducted to determine the needs of the AQM community, the information most \nrelevant  to  them,  and  their  preferred  methods  of  sharing  knowledge.13 The \nwebsite will create an enabling environment for collaboration and knowledge \ncreation and transfer among and on behalf of stakeholders, including government \nand AQM professionals. The TA aims for this knowledge to be integrated into \ngovernment policy documents. The website will further the development of an \nintegrated online database, CitiesACT (for air, climate, and transport), which \nconsists of key national and city data on demographics, economic structure, \ntransport and energy structure, air quality, and GHG emissions. An important \nfeature of the TA is its help in organizing the collection of existing data from \ndifferent stakeholders. Content for the website and the CitiesACT portal will be \nprovided by the CAI-Asia Center, its country networks, and strategic knowledge \npartners. 14 \n \n(ii)  Maintenance of regional AQM COPs. The TA aims to build and strengthen \nsustainable AQM COPs to enable knowledge transfer and the sharing of best \npractices. The COPs will be tied to an online community of professionals, or a \n\u201cwho\u2019s who,\u201d to develop governments\u2019 capacity in decision making and assess its \npotential to supplement other approaches to capacity building.15 The TA will set \nup COPs in key areas where Asian cities need to take action in the coming years \nand where they lack information, especially regarding new policy areas. Initially, \ntwo  COPs  will  be  maintained:  (i)  co-benefits  of  AQM  and  climate  change \nmitigation and (ii) sustainable urban transport. A full-time moderator will facilitate \ndiscussions in these COPs. Virtual meetings and webcasting will be actively used \nto ensure COP members\u2019 active participation, which will help offset the carbon \nfootprint  created  by  face-to-face  international  workshops  and  meetings.  The \nCOPs will be important for assessing the information needs of the air quality, \nclimate change, and sustainable transport community, as well as for capturing \nand transferring knowledge to be documented on the online portal. The TA will \n                                                 \n12 A portal is a website that provides links to other websites and may include data and information harvested from \nexternal sources.  \n13 The surveys will also determine stakeholders\u2019 current ICT use. When necessary, quick, small follow-up surveys \nmay periodically be conducted to evaluate and monitor how effective stakeholders use ICT for AQM, climate \nchange co-benefits, and transport. \n14 In addition to AQM, climate change, and transport, other topics likely to be covered include cleaner energy, \nbiofuels, dust and sandstorms, transboundary air pollution, and ports. \n15 This will be in the form of an online social network, discussion forum, or e-group. \n ", "4   \nconduct three case studies on how the proposed COPs can effectively contribute \nto building the capacity of policy makers and strengthening policy development \nprocesses related to AQM and climate change mitigation, thereby incorporating \nAQM and climate change in government policy documents. These will include \none regional, one national, and one local case study. The topics of the three case \nstudies  will  be  linked to  the  two  COPs  established  by the  TA.  The  specific \ncountries and cities to be studied will be determined at the inception stage of the \nTA in consultation with operational departments in ADB and national and regional \nagencies working on AQM and climate change mitigation.16 Toward the end of \nthe case studies, a report on them will be prepared that includes an evaluation to \ndetermine which knowledge-sharing mechanism was most effective and which of \nthe approaches needs to be improved. The results of the case studies will be \ndisseminated to the AQM community through email, internet, and international \nmeetings and workshops.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, to be financed as a grant by the Japan Special \nFund, funded by the Government of Japan. See Appendix 2 for the detailed cost estimates.  \nDisbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2008, as amended from time to time). \n   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  ADB will be the Executing Agency, and the CAI-Asia Center will be the Implementing \nAgency.  ADB  will  exercise  administrative  oversight  through  its  Regional  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment Department. The relationship will be governed by a written agreement between \nADB and the CAI-Asia Center that will facilitate the implementation of the TA, including the \nengagement of consultants through the CAI-Asia Center.17 In 2001, ADB, World Bank, and US-\nAsia  Environment  Partnership  (a  project  of  the  United  Sates  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment) launched CAI-Asia, which has become the acknowledged regional convener and \ninformation-exchange facilitator on urban air quality in Asia, bringing policy makers together to \nshare experiences. Through its extended network of members and partners, CAI-Asia has a \nunique capacity to act as a documenter of AQM trends in Asia, and the continued provision of \nthese  knowledge  products  and  services  is  expected  by  DMCs  in  the  region.18 CAI-Asia \nincreasingly interacts with other, more general knowledge providers, especially in providing \ntechnical inputs into their knowledge management initiatives.19 In June 2007, the CAI-Asia \nCenter was established as an independent nongovernment organization to act as the secretariat \nto the CAI-Asia partnership.20  \n \n                                                 \n16 The final choice of case studies  will be influenced by  (i) local ownership and  willingness to contribute to \nimplementation and (ii) the possible contribution that ICT and the COP can make to the proposed case study. No \nwork will commence in a DMC until a no-objection letter has been obtained for its participation in the TA. \n17 ADB already has a letter of intent with the CAI-Asia Center.   \n18 The current website (www.cleanairnet.org/caiasia) receives over 500,000 hits per month, and the listserv has more \nthan 1,250 members.  \n19 CAI-Asia was an active partner in the benchmarking study of AQM capability in Asian cities that was implemented \nby the Stockholm Environment Institute with support from ADB and the Korean Environment Institute. Also, the \nHealth Effects Institute has collected a lot of data through the Public Health and Air Pollution in Asia\u2013Science \nAccess on the Net project, which was supported by CAI-Asia and ADB. \n20 See www.cleanairnet.org/caiasia/partnership and www.cleanairnet.org/caiasia/center \n ", "  5\n13.  The TA will take a programmatic approach to support, not duplicate, activities already \nbeing undertaken by ADB and other regional organizations in Asia with respect to AQM21. The \nTA will integrate knowledge on AQM and sustainable transport initiatives managed by other \norganizations active in Asia. Toward implementing the TA, the CAL-Asia Center will seek to \nestablish cooperation agreements with the Asia-Pacific Gateway to Climate and Development, \nAsia-Pacific Gateway, United Nations Environment Programme, United Nations Economic and \nSocial Commission in Asia and the Pacific, International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s Regional \nCooperative  Agreement  Regional  Office,  and  other  organizations.  It  will  strengthen  the \nknowledge-management  activities  of  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN) \nthrough the ASEAN Working Group on Environmentally Sustainable Cities. The TA will further \ncomplement and cooperate with relevant knowledge hubs established by ADB on reduce, reuse, \nand recycle (3Rs) energy, and climate change.22  \n \n14.  Sixty-nine person-months are required for this TA. For administrative efficiency, the \nengagement of consultants will be through the CAI-Asia Center and will follow the agreement \nmentioned above, which will require recruitment in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  All  commercial  software  and \nequipment procured for this TA will be turned over to the CAI-Asia Center to help ensure the \nsustainability  of  the  online  portal and  the  COPs  beyond  TA  completion.  ADB  will  issue a \ncertificate of turnover to be signed by the CAI-Asia Center.23 \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis for \nCapturing and Transferring Air Quality Management Knowledge in Asia, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n21 No activities under this TA will commence until ADB has received a no-objection from the respective DMC, in which \nactivities are planned. \n22 For 3Rs the Asian Institute of Technology, for energy the Energy Research Institute, and for climate change \nTsinghua University. \n23 Equipment includes at least one desktop computer.
