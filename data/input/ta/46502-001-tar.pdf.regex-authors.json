Improvements \nin trade and private sector access to international markets have increasingly depended on \nefficient and low-cost trade services and logistics. However, the Pacific developing member \ncountries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) face severe constraints caused by \ngeography, infrastructure, service provision, and procedures.1 Consequently, trade facilitation \nand transport logistics remain key development priorities. This regional capacity development \ntechnical assistance (TA) is expected to ease these constraints. \n \n2.  Representatives  from  the  Pacific  region  and  ADB  developed  the  TA  concept  at  a \nworkshop on trade facilitation held in Fiji in April 2013. The TA is aligned with the strategic \npriorities of the Pacific Plan, which was endorsed by leaders at the Pacific Islands Forum \nmeeting in Papua New Guinea in 2005 and revised in 2007.2 It is also aligned with ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2020, and ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach 2010\u20132014, which call for improved connectivity for \nregional integration.3 This TA is included in ADB\u2019s Pacific regional operations business plan for \n2014\u20132016.4  The TA design and monitoring framework is presented in Appendix 1.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Changing trade patterns, opportunities and challenges. ADB\u2019s Pacific DMCs are \nscattered across 30 million square kilometers of ocean; this ocean area constitutes one-third of \nthe  earth\u2019s  surface,  but  the  land  area  of  Pacific  DMCs  totals  only  about  500,000  square \nkilometers. With the exception of Papua New Guinea, which makes up 88% of the landmass, \nthe Pacific DMCs can be characterized as small, remote, and fragmented island groups with \nlimited  resource  bases,  fairly  undiversified  economies,  and  dependent  on  imports.  These \ncharacteristics impede both domestic economic integration and integration with regional and \nglobal  markets.  High  transport  costs  and  restrictive  policies  constrain  market  access  and \ndevelopment  of  services  that  would  provide  incentives  for  specialization  and  a  shift  from \nsubsistence production. No region is more dependent on sea and air transport infrastructure, \nservices, and logistics. \n \n4.  Global  economic  restructuring  is  rapidly  changing  the  economic  links  between  the \nPacific DMCs and developed and emerging economies. There are four major shipping patterns \nin the Pacific: the east\u2013west service between Asia, Europe, and North America; north\u2013south \nservice between Australia, New Zealand, North America, and Northeast Asia; intraregional \nservices between Australia, New Zealand, and Pacific countries; and domestic services within \nPacific countries.  \n \n5.  The total Pacific trade with the world has increased from $6.4 billion to $25.4 billion \nduring 2000\u20132012.6 Exports from the Pacific include palm oil, coffee, coconut, and fish; imports \ninclude electrical machinery, cars, equipment, petroleum or fuel, and a high proportion of the \n                                                \n1  The Pacific DMCs refer to the Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, \nNauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.  \n2  Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat. 2007.

Trade within the Pacific region is a very small proportion of \nthe overall trade; with intraregional trade accounting for only about 2% of total trade volume. \n \n6.  There have been changes in the direction of trade in the last 13 years\u2014the share with \nAustralia and New Zealand has declined, while the share with Southeast Asia, the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, and India has increased significantly, from 15.1% in 2000 to 26.3% in 2012.7 \nThese trade corridors provide significant opportunities for Pacific DMCs to mitigate economic \nand geographic isolation through improved transport connectivity and trade facilitation that will \nbenefit both these countries and their trading partners.  \n \n7.  Need  for  trade  and  transport  facilitation.  Weak  trade  and  transport  logistics \nperformance is a key factor constraining interregional and intraregional trade growth in the \nPacific. To improve competitiveness and trade and transport facilitation (TTF) performance in \nthe areas of infrastructure, services, and procedures and processes are needed in the Pacific \nDMCs.8 Pacific DMCs are seeking assistance to strategically reform, modernize, and strengthen \nthe capacity of institutions, and invest in trade-related infrastructure. This TA is designed to \nconsider the remote and archipelagic nature of Pacific DMCs and respond to these needs \nexpressed to maximize benefit of physical infrastructure development ADB has supported. \n \n8.  For most countries in the Pacific, it takes exporters 22 days to comply with procedures, \nwith a cost to import of about $1,600 per container; this is 4\u20136 times higher than in Singapore, \nand 3\u20134 times higher than in Australia.9 Trade and transport infrastructure is inadequate and \nperformance could be improved, as it has been in comparators such as Caribbean islands, with \nsimilar  levels  of  income  and  development  constraints. 10  Overall  transport  and  logistics \nperformance  is  affected  by  inadequate  infrastructure  capacity,  widely  varying  infrastructure \nquality, inefficient port operations and port handling, poor maintenance, and lack of adequate \nmeasures to meet international standards and services.  \n \n9.  The benchmarking indices mentioned above are informative in highlighting the relative \nperformance of Pacific DMCs, but typically provide insufficient detail to develop improvement \nplans, which requires further study.  \n \n10.  Coordination with development partners. The TA complements programs of other \ndevelopment partners, which focus on specific compliance aspects of customs processes and \ndo not cover all Pacific DMCs. The European Union, as part of a 2-year program for African, \nCaribbean  and  Pacific  States,  and  the  Government  of  Japan  through  the World  Customs \nOrganization  (WCO),  are  financing  support  for  customs  cooperation  implemented  by  the \nOceania Customs Organization, which ends in 2014. The program is supporting countries to \nachieve internationally compliant customs processes through workshops and related activities. \nThe Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade support customs policy \nand institutional reform. This TA takes a regional approach to selectively support needs and \naddress gaps in coordination with these and other development partners.

There are few regional initiatives in the Pacific on trade and transport \nfacilitation that allow development partners to coordinate on investments. The Pacific Region \nInfrastructure Facility provides an opportunity to coordinate TA and approaches to infrastructure \nplanning and development in order to address TTF. 11 \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The expected impact of the TA will be improved trade competitiveness of Pacific DMCs, \nand the outcome will be participating Pacific DMC governments strategically plan trade and \ntransport  facilitation  investments.  The  expected  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  measured  by  a \ndecrease in the time and cost to export and import and outcome will be measured by number of \nTTF assessments led by national agencies, implementation plans adopted by government, and \ntrade facilitation milestones achieved by participating DMCs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will conduct a regional analysis that examines the trade and transport linkages \nand  provides  insights  on  where  and  how  Pacific  DMCs  can  benefit  from  the  emerging \nopportunities that growth in Asia provides.  \n \n13.  This TA will assess current TTF performance in detail and identify inefficiencies at \ngateways, in clearance procedures, and in transport logistics. The TA will identify improvements \nin relevant transport infrastructure, services, policies, and processes that are critical to lowering \ntrade costs. There is also a clear need for governments to (i) use tools to measure TTF \nperformance to understand the contribution of high transport and logistics costs for Pacific \nDMCs; (ii) better understand trade and transport demand to identify realistic opportunities to \nstrategically and selectively upgrade and expand transport infrastructure and improve logistics; \nand  (iii)  strengthen  capacity  to  strategically  improve  and  modernize  trade  logistics.  TTF \nimprovements will lower the costs of importing essential commodities, benefiting the people in \nthe Pacific. TTF measures are expected to improve the economic competitiveness and promote \nthe participation of small enterprises in international trade, thus enhancing growth prospects. \n \n14.  Activities  will  be  undertaken  in  seven  Pacific  DMCs:  Fiji,  the  Federated  States  of \nMicronesia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Timor-Leste, Tonga, and Vanuatu. These DMCs were \nselected based on the governments\u2019 interest in TTF and potential synergies with ADB\u2019s current \nmaritime, aviation, and land transport operations. A summary of the outputs is presented below. \n \n15.  Output  1:  Assessment  tools  for  trade  facilitation  and  transport  logistics \nperformance established and institutionalized. To assess performance, a business process \nanalysis approach will be adopted, including time/cost-distance (TCD) and time release studies \nunder output 1. TCD methodology will measure the financial and time costs of trading along \nspecific routes of commodity flow. It will be based on data collected on the cost and time \nassociated with the transport process, delays incurred at ports and inland terminals, freight \nand/or document handling charges and other fees levied, and material progress or movement of \n                                                \n11 The Pacific Region Infrastructure Facility members comprise ADB, the Australian Government Department of \nForeign Affairs and Trade, the European Commission and European Investment Bank, New Zealand Ministry of \nForeign Affairs and Trade, and the World Bank Group, including the International Finance Corporation. \n ", "4  \ngoods along a transport route. The studies will be guided by a working group in each Pacific \nDMC and a joint working group for the subregion or region. The detailed time/cost profiles will \nhelp identify priority corridors and develop an understanding to target support to facilitate more \nefficient passage by examining systemic issues and specific factors affecting each route. The \ndata will also help identify bottlenecks and restrictive policies, target improvements, and improve \nefficiency along specific routes. The output will also focus on institutionalizing these assessment \ntools and frameworks to enable their use on a regular basis to track progress.  \n \n16.  Output 2: National and regional agencies\u2019 capacities to assess trade and transport \ndemand  and  design  investment  and  policy  options  strengthened.  This  output  will  \n(i) develop profiles of intraregional and interregional trade, and a model to link trade volume with \ntransport flow for the Pacific region; and (ii) formulate transport strategies and investment plans \nfor hard and soft infrastructure for a subset of Pacific DMCs participating under this TA. The \nmodel developed will draw from knowledge products, and will quantify the impacts of trade and \ntransport  policies  on  international  cargo  shipping  and  economic  activities  of  individual \neconomies, Asia\u2013Pacific Economic Cooperation members, and other major trading partners.12 \nThe model will forecast the trade values and international cargo flows of each economy, and \nsimulate  policy  impacts  corresponding  to  implementation  of  a  wide  range  of  trade  and \ninfrastructure-related policy decisions. The impacts will include international cargo flow patterns \nand  regional  economic  activities  resulting  from  implementation  of  transport  policies  (e.g., \nconstruction of new terminals and berths in ports, improving transaction times at port terminals, \ndiscounting charges and fares, and removing border barriers). The tools developed will inform \nsector strategies, investment plans, and TA designs.  \n \n17.  Output 3: Regional and national agencies\u2019 capacities to improve logistics and \ncustoms performance strengthened. Based on assessments of trade facilitation performance, \nthis output will provide targeted support for the preparation of plans for trade and transport \nfacilitation, including customs modernization relevant for Pacific DMCs. In addition, the capacity \nof regional institutions and country customs departments for automation, risk management, \ncoordinated border management (through single window or equivalent systems for selected \nPacific DMCs), valuation, and post-clearance audit will be developed through targeted national \nand regional workshops. For customs modernization, system implementation needs will be \nidentified and TA support and investment plans will also be developed. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $2.0 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction, and will be administered by ADB. ADB, the United Nations \nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP), Oceania Customs \nOrganization, and WCO will provide counterpart support in the form of staff time, office space, \ncommunication  support,  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  The  detailed  cost  estimates  and \nfinancing plan are included in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2016. ADB\u2019s \nPacific  Department  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  TA  and  will  coordinate  with  the \ngovernments and other stakeholders in the Pacific DMCs and guide implementation of the TA.  \n \n                                                \n12 ADB 2012.

The TA will finance consultant services for a total of 115 person-months, including 43 \nperson-months  of  international  consultant  and  72  person-months  of  national  consultant \nservices.  Uniquely  qualified  UNESCAP  and WCO  resource  experts  will  form  teams  under \nseparate agreements with ADB, while a commercial firm (engaged using quality and cost-based \nselection, with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20) and individual consultants will be engaged by ADB \nin accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime).13 An outline of the terms of reference for the consultants is in Appendix 3. The proceeds \nof the TA will be disbursed in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Some office equipment will be procured for \nTA implementation, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from \ntime to time). Upon TA completion, the assets will be turned over to the relevant government \nagencies in the participating Pacific DMCs. \n \n21.  The TA will be implemented by three teams: (i) an assessment team, consisting of \nUNESCAP and WCO experts specializing in business process analysis, time release study, and \nTCD  studies,  and  national  consultants;  (ii)  a  modeling  team,  consisting  of  a  senior  trade \nspecialist and modeler as individual consultants; and (iii) a policy and investment planning team \nof consultants recruited through a firm. The assessment team will mainly conduct the studies \nand training activities of outputs 1 and 3. The modeling team will focus on output 2 activities, \nplanning team will use assessment reports and the modeling activities to develop transport and \nlogistics improvement investment plans, and policy options. A program coordinator will support \nTA implementation, and facilitate efficient and timely delivery of TA outputs. The assessment \nand modeling teams will be mobilized in the first year and complete their work in 15 months. \nThe planning team will be mobilized in the second year, their specific tasks largely determined \nby the assessment findings. The teams will be guided by ADB\u2019s Pacific Department. \n \n22.  The studies will be guided by a working group in each Pacific DMC and a joint working \ngroup for the subregion or region. ADB will coordinate closely with international and bilateral \nagencies in implementing this TA, including the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and \nTrade,  the  European  Union,  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  New  Zealand \nGovernment Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the World Bank, and other development \npartners.  Regional  stakeholders  include  the  Pacific  Islands  Forum  Secretariat  and  the \nSecretariat of the Pacific Community, which both work on regional integration. Staff from ADB, \nthe Customs and Tariff Bureau in Japan\u2019s Ministry of Finance, UNESCAP, and WCO will serve \nas resource experts.  \n \n23.  The analytical tools and work products of the TA will be maintained, and disseminated \nby national and regional institutions including the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat and the \nSecretariat of the Pacific Community, to ensure sustainability of support. The TA publications \ndeveloped with ADB internal and external partners will be shared at Pacific regional forums and \nconferences during the TA implementation and at the conclusion of the TA.14 \n \nIV.

Background \n \n1.  To implement the 24-month technical assistance (TA), the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  will  engage  (i)  resource  experts  from  the  United  Nations  Economic  and  Social \nCommission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) and the World Customs Organization (WCO), \n(ii) individual consultants, and (iii) a firm. Consultant services will total 115 person-months (43 \nperson-months of international and 72 person-months of national services), with all consultants \nrecruited in accordance with ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). The consultants will work in three teams: (i) an assessment team, consisting \nof UNESCAP and WCO experts and national consultants; (ii) a modeling team, consisting of a \nsenior trade specialist and modeler as individual consultants; and (iii) a policy and investment \nplanning team of consultants recruited through a firm. The assessment team will mainly conduct \nthe studies and training activities of outputs 1 and 3. The modeling team will focus on output 2 \nactivities, while the planning team will use reports from the assessments and the modeling \nactivities to develop transport and logistics improvement investment plans and policy options. A \nprogram coordinator will support the TA implementation by facilitating the efficient and timely \ndelivery of the outputs of this TA. The assessment and modeling teams will be mobilized in the \nfirst year and complete work within 15 months, while the planning team will be mobilized in the \nsecond year. The teams will be guided by the ADB Pacific Department Transport sector team. \n \n2.  In each participating Pacific developing member country (DMC), a working group will be \nformed with representatives from the Pacific government agencies involved in trade, customs, \nand  transport;  ADB;  UNESCAP;  and  WCO.  The  working  group  will  provide  inputs  to  TA \nimplementation, and will (i) review the scope of the assessments to be conducted, (ii) select \nproducts for which export and import processes will be evaluated, (iii) select specific trade \ncorridors or routes and/or modes of transport, (iv) select gateway seaports and/or airports to \ncover, and (v) discuss findings and facilitate adoption of recommendations and plans. The \nassessment team, including resource experts from UNESCAP and WCO, will conduct training \nworkshops  to  introduce  the  assessment  tools,  collect  data,  and  share  findings  with \nstakeholders. The ADB country team leaders will review intermediate work products, including \nknowledge products. \n \nB.  Consultancy Positions and Requirements \n1.  Assessment Team \n3.  The assessments will be carried out by two subteams led by UNESCAP and WCO staff \nunder separate agreements with ADB, which will coordinate closely. UNESCAP and WCO staff \nwill join the team as resource experts as outlined in memorandums of understanding between \nADB and both UNESCAP and WCO. \n \n4.  Structured interviews  will be conducted with key stakeholders involved in transport, \ncommercial, and financial procedural transactions that make up the domestic and international \nsupply chains. These stakeholders include private service providers such as freight forwarders, \nconsolidators, transport operators, and financial intermediaries, as well as public agencies (e.g., \ncustoms, border management, ports, and transport regulation agencies). Regional stakeholders \nwill include the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat (PIFS) and the Secretariat of the Pacific \nCommunity  (SPC),  which  work  on  regional  integration.  Integrating  this  understanding  with \n ", "  Appendix 3  11 \nsupply chain analysis will help identify corrective actions to facilitate transport and trade and \nimprove competitiveness. The depth of the assessments will be determined by the needs and \ninterest of specific governments in trade and transport facilitation (TTF).  \n \n5.  Trade  facilitation  expert  (I-Business  process  analysis)  and  assessment  team \nleader (international). The team leader will be responsible for the assessments and for the \nquality  of  baseline  assessments  of  trade  and  transport  facilitation  using  business  process \nanalysis (BPA); an overall process analysis of import and export goods, including procedures \nand physical movement; and the development of a regional trade facilitation assessment and \nmonitoring framework. The team leader will also be responsible for a consolidated trade and \ntransport facilitation assessment report, and in-country capacity development of stakeholders to \nconduct BPA in several ADB DMCs in the Pacific (this may include up to seven countries). \nThese assessments will be carried out so as to establish a process and related tools that can be \nused to track and measure performance over time. Because the process is expected to support \nand guide continuous improvements in trade and transport facilitation in the longer term, the \nprocess and tools will be anchored in a local agency or stakeholder institution to enhance \nsustainability. The team leader will supervise the activities of a national consultant, coordinate \nclosely with the WCO team, and be guided by the ADB resource expert and project officer. \n \n6.  Trade facilitation advisors (I-Business process analysis) (five national consultants, 3 \nperson-months each). Under UNESCAP guidance, each national advisor will work closely with \nthe government agencies and other relevant stakeholders in their respective country to support \nthem in the conduct of the BPA, and conduct parts of the analyses as needed to prepare the \nBPA reports. \n \n7.  Each advisor will have an undergraduate degree and preferably a graduate degree in \neconomics, trade, business management, or related field; at least 5 years of experience working \non trade facilitation with a national, regional, or international organization; and strong writing \nskills demonstrated through authored reports or other written work. Work experience in the \nPacific would be preferred. The advisor will be supervised by the UNESCAP resource expert \nfrom  the  Trade  Facilitation  Unit  of  UNESCAP  and  coordinate  closely  with  the  program \ncoordinator and the WCO team. \n \n8.  Transport logistics expert (international). The expert will be responsible for conducting \nthe time/cost-distance (TCD) study to examine the performance of the international transport \nlogistics of cargo movement. The TCD study will look specifically at the physical movement of \ncargo from origin to destination along a given route. For a trade corridor, data to be collected \nincludes  type  of  cargo;  mode  of  transport;  vehicle  and  vessel  specification;  route;  facility \nprofiles; and the distance, time, and cost of each leg of the journey. The data is typically \nobtained from freight forwarders, transport operators, and port authorities. Data will be collected \nfor  the  transport  process  from  physical  origin  to  physical  destination,  and  a  graphical \nrepresentation or profiles will be produced based on the data.  \n \n9.  The  methodology  will  be  based  on  data  collected  on  time  and  costs  of  transport \nprocesses, delays incurred at ports and inland terminals, freight or document handling charges \nand other fees levied, and material progress or movement of goods along a transport route. The \ncollected data may be supplemented with estimated data, if necessary. The detailed time/cost \nprofiles will help examine transport logistics and develop an understanding to target support for \nmore efficient passage by examining systemic issues and specific factors affecting each route. \nThe data will also help policy makers to identify bottlenecks, reduce constraints, and improve \nefficiency along specific routes. \n ", "12  Appendix 3 \n \n \n \n10.  Transport logistics advisors (five national consultants, 3 person-months each). The \nnational advisors, guided by the UNESCAP transport logistics expert, will work closely with \ngovernment agencies and other relevant stakeholders in their respective countries (consisting of \nup to seven Pacific DMCs) to conduct the TCD analysis and prepare the country report. \n \n11.

Work experience in the Pacific would be preferred. Each advisor will be \nsupervised by the UNESCAP transport logistics expert and coordinate closely with the program \ncoordinator. \n \n12.  Trade  facilitation  expert  (II-Time  release  study)  (international). The  expert  will  be \nresponsible for the quality of baseline assessments of time release studies (TRSs) and in-\ncountry capacity development to conduct TRSs. These assessments will be carried out so as to \nestablish a process and related tools that can be used to track and measure performance over \ntime. Because the process is expected to support and guide continuous improvements in trade \nfacilitation in the longer term, the process and tools will be anchored in a local agency or \nstakeholder institution to enhance sustainability. The status of and/or request for national and/or \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations single window may also be explored. The expert will \nsupervise the activities of a national consultant and be guided by the ADB resource expert and \nproject officer. \n \n13.  Trade facilitation advisors (II-Time release study) (five national consultants, 3 person-\nmonths each). The national advisors will work closely with government agencies and other \nrelevant stakeholders in their respective countries (comprising up to five Pacific DMCs) to \nsupport them in the conduct of the TRS, and will conduct parts of the analyses as needed to \nprepare the TRS reports. \n \n14.  The advisors will have an undergraduate degree and preferably a graduate degree in \neconomics, trade, business management, or related field; at least 5 years of experience working \non trade facilitation or similar area and with a national, regional, or international organization; \nand strong writing skills demonstrated through authored reports or other written work. Work \nexperience in the Pacific would be preferred. The advisors will be supervised by the WCO \nexpert and coordinate closely with the program coordinator. \n \n2.  Trade and Transport Modeling Team \n15.  The modeling team will develop profiles of intraregional and interregional trade, and a \nmodel to link trade volume with transport flow for the Pacific region, to lead to formulation of \ntransport strategies and investment plans for hard and soft infrastructure for selected Pacific \nDMCs under this TA. The model will quantify the impacts of trade and transport policies on \ninternational  cargo  shipping  and  economic  activities  of  individual  economies,  Asia-Pacific \nEconomic Cooperation (APEC) members, and other major trading partners. By partnering with a \nsystem development group, data for Pacific DMCs will be prepared, and Pacific DMCs will be \nrepresented in a model. The model will be used for analysis of Pacific DMC\u2019s own economic \n ", "  Appendix 3  13 \ninterests, as well as subregional and regional impacts linked to other regions.1 Data developed \nbased on an understanding of the evolving economic linkages of Pacific countries with their \ntrading partners will be used for this effort.2 \n \n16.  Senior  trade  specialist  (international  consultant,  4  person-months).  The  senior \nspecialist will serve as the modeling team leader and lead the analyses of trade and transport \nflow and impact of trade and transport policy and infrastructure investments in the Pacific \nregion, using TTF model(s) to establish the relationship between TTF and transport flows. The \nsenior specialist will lead all aspects of output 3 of the TA including the scenario and TTF model \ndevelopment, and calibration and analysis using the TTF model. The analysis will be designed \nto simulate trade and international cargo flows of each economy and simulate impacts by \nimplementing a range of trade and transport infrastructure decisions. The impacts may include \ncargo flow patterns, transport costs, and the regional economic activities that can be expected \ndue to transport and trade facilitation improvements (e.g., construction of new terminals and \nberths in ports, improving transaction times at port terminals, and discounting charges and \nfares). The model developed will be used to assess hard and soft infrastructure capacity and \nperformance needs to inform investment design decisions. \n \n17.
