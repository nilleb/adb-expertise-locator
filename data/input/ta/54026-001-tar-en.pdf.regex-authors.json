INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) cluster will support the achievement \nof resilient ecological protection and high-quality development goals in the Yellow River basin in \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The TA cluster will design and implement approaches to \nsupport natural, human, social, and physical capitals required to enable high-quality, green \ndevelopment  and  ecological  protection  via  (i)  informing  strategic  institutional,  policy  and \ngovernance reforms on key development issues; (ii) demonstrating innovative technologies and \nintegrated  nature-positive  solutions;  and  (iii)  promoting  knowledge  sharing  and  strategic \npartnerships for multi-stakeholder and private sector engagement. \n \n2.  The TA cluster subprojects were developed on the request of the Government of the PRC. \nThe TA cluster is aligned with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Strategy 2030\u2019s operational \npriorities1 and the strategic operational focus of ADB\u2019s assistance to the PRC towards environmental \nprotection, inclusive and sustainable growth with knowledge at the center of its operations.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.   Yellow River supports multipurpose development in a fragile human-nature system. \nGranting its name from the \u201cloess\u201d fine-grained sediments coloring its waters, the Yellow River \nruns for 5,464 kilometers, from its source in Bayan Har mountains on the Tibetan Plateau to the \nBohai sea. It is the second largest river in the PRC, after the Yangtze, and the sixth longest river \nin the world. The river covers a basin area of 752,400 square kilometers, crosses nine provinces, \nis home to around 150 million people. 3 Agriculture output contributes to feeding about 12% of the \nPRC's population, irrigates about 15% of arable land, accounts for 8% of national gross domestic \nproduct,4 and supplies water to 66 prefectural-level cities and 340 counties. The river is an \nimportant ecological corridor and arterial connection among the Qinghai-Tibet plateau, the Loess \nplateau, and the Northern Plain, playing an irreplaceable role for national ecological, water, and \nfood security. Considered one of the most hydrologically complex rivers in the world, its waters \ncarry and deposit about 1.6 billion tons of sediments on the riverbed yearly. This generates the \nphenomenon of the \u201changing river,\u201d with the bed reaching 10 meters above the adjacent plain in \nthe downstream valley. Accounting for only 2% of the country\u2019s water resources, the region is \nseverely water scarce and faces extreme climatic conditions, causing destructive droughts and \nfloods.5 In the past 30 years, the total water resources have reduced by 13.4% (footnote 4). With \npermafrost ice in the Hindu Kush Himalayas region rapidly melting due to global warming,6 the \nYellow River\u2019s long-term freshwater availability, vital for drinking water and socio-economic \ndevelopment in the basin,7 is highly under threat. The increase in frequency and intensity of \ndevastating floods, destroying land and livelihoods, is an immediate and visible consequence of \nclimate  change  impacts  in  the  short-term.  Water  stress  and  scarcity  have  been  further \n \n1  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2016.

Agriculture accounts for about 69.6% of total withdrawal and is the largest \nconsumer of water in the basin. Water resources are further strained due to pollution from \nagricultural  runoff,  township  and  village  enterprises,  and  rural  and  industrial  wastewater \ndischarged into the water streams. In terms of ecological security, more than three-fourths of the \ntotal basin area is defined as ecologically fragile.8  \n \n4.  The Yellow River basin is an important economic hub for the PRC, but it has been facing \never increasing constraints to maintain its current economic function as well as striving to meet \nits sustainable development potential. Balancing economy, ecology, and community in the Yellow \nRiver basin is becoming more challenging which is often further compounded by climate change. \nThe  complex  and  integrated  relationship  between  ecosystems,  natural  resources,  climate \nchange, biodiversity, and human interaction is fragile, and imbalance can result in extreme \nsituations such as the coronavirus disease pandemic. Balanced health of people, animals, and \nenvironment are important and crucial precursor for sustainable development. Investing in and \npromoting high productivity of natural, human, social, and physical capitals, as the building blocks \nfor sustainable development, are crucial to enabling high-quality growth and ecological protection.  \n \n5.  Water underpins social and economic development. Achieving water security, through \nbalancing the resource as a human basic need and a socio-economic good, is the entry point for \nhigh-quality, green development and equitable growth across the basin and within the PRC. \nDespite progresses made in the last 20 years,9 complex development issues remain unaddressed \nand have contributed to ongoing severe pressures on the basin\u2019s ecology, including pollution and \noverexploitation of ecosystem services; inadequate provision of clean water supply and sanitation \nservices posing the most vulnerable groups (i.e., urban poor, women, and elders) at risk of \ncontracting water-borne diseases; and widening of rural-urban disparity in the less developed \nprovinces. The underpinning causes can be grouped into three macro areas: (i) lack of strategic \nbasin-wide scale planning, policy incoherence, poor coordination mechanisms across institutions \nand regions, compounded by lack of economic and financial incentives; (ii) untapped potential for \ninnovation, skills development, and integrated approaches for sustainable and inclusive rural-\nurban  development;  and  (iii)  inadequate  \u201cknowledge  spillover\u201d  of  national,  regional,  and \ninternational best practices.  \n \n6.  Government strategy. Recognizing these development challenges, the government has \npromoted its vision of \u201cecological civilization\u201d10 to reinforce the symbiosis between economic \ndevelopment and environmental protection. Ongoing national programs such as the Yangtze \nRiver Economic Belt (YREB) Development Plan, Rural Vitalization Strategy, and the upcoming \n14th Five-Year Plan (2021\u20132025) are the main pillars to keep shaping the PRC\u2019s objective for \necological civilization and overall green transformation. This form of green transformation has a \nstronger focus on high-quality development, people\u2019s broader well-being, innovation, urban-rural \ndevelopment  cooperation,  improved  natural  resources  management  and  policy  reforms  for \nbalancing environmental protection and economic growth. Yet, river basin management remains \na development challenge due to the inherent complexity and need for integrated approaches that \nare  multisectoral  and  inclusive.  While  the  Yellow  River  basin  has  been  earmarked  as  a \n \n8  YRCC, Ministry of Water Resources, PRC.

The areas of forests and wetlands have also enlarged. \n10 A. Hanson. 2019. Ecological Civilization in the People\u2019s Republic of China: Values, Action, and Future Needs.

Learning from the YREB programmatic approach and rural vitalization. Building on \nover $10 billion investment demonstration projects in the YREB during 2000\u20132015, ADB has \nhistorically played a catalytic role in the Yangtze River. In order to maximize its limited resources \nand institutional advantages, ADB set up the YREB programmatic approach (phase one 2017\u2013\n2020) to support the PRC\u2019s YREB Plan with cross-sector and knowledge-driven integrated \nprojects.12 The fundamental innovation of this approach is its geographic concept of \u201ccorridor\u201d \nencompassing economic, social, and ecological multidimensional linkages. This is a step beyond \ntraditional watershed management towards a more holistic protection of regional public goods. \nThis approach was expanded to support the rural vitalization strategy13 and is ongoing both in the \nYREB and other regions.14 The core principles of these interventions provide highly relevant \nlessons for addressing the Yellow River basin\u2019s complex development challenges. These include \nthe adoption of a whole-of-ecosystem approach by planning across the basin; multi-stakeholder \nengagement to carefully identify and address impacts on communities and livelihoods; and the \ndesign  of  institutional  frameworks  to  incentivize  long-term  financial  sustainability  for  eco-\ncompensation programs and facilitate creation of an enabling environment to achieve the desired \nsocial, economic, and environmental outcomes across the basin.15  \n \n8.  Building on these lessons learnt,16 ADB is proposing a new programmatic approach to \nsupport the PRC to address the development challenges in the Yellow River basin.17 The Yellow \nRiver  Ecological  Corridor  (YREC)  program  proposes  to  restore  and  enhance  the  basin\u2019s \necological security by addressing the conflicting and competing demands for natural capital from \nall users, agriculture, urban, and industry, to reduce the resulting degradation of ecosystems and \noveruse of natural resources for more transformative high-quality, green development. The YREC \napproach will target three priority areas for ADB support: (i) institutional strengthening with \ngovernance and policy reforms; (ii) demonstrating innovative technologies through new models \nand integrated solutions; and (iii) deriving experiences and lessons learned to promote knowledge \nsharing and strategic partnership, including private sector engagement to scale up and sustain \nsuccessful actions. These priorities will promote a comprehensive whole-of-ecosystem approach \nand integrated river basin management. The YREC program will be applied across sectors and \nthematic  areas  through  a  One-ADB  multi-department  approach  focusing  interventions  on                        \n(i) natural capital and agro-ecological development (namely, water security, natural resources \n \n11  President Xi Jinping speech at the \u201cSymposium on Ecological Protection and High-Quality Development in the Yellow \nRiver Basin\u201d (September 2019), highlighted the focus on ecological protection, comprehensive management \nlandscapes, water, forests, lakes, grasslands, and deserts to ensure the river\u2019s long-term stability and promote high-\nquality development in the whole basin from mountains to sea.  \n12  The YREB programmatic approach focused on four strategic priority areas: (i) Ecosystem restoration, environmental \nprotection, and management of water resources; (ii) Green and inclusive industrial development; (iii) Integrated \nmultimodal corridor; (iv) Institutional strengthening and policy reform. ADB invested an indicative budget of $2 billion. \n13  ADB support to rural vitalization was formalized through a memorandum of understanding signed with the PRC \ngovernment PRC (29 August 2018) and focuses on environmental and natural resource security, rural wastewater and \nsolid waste management, sustainable and resilient modern agriculture, rural economy development, integrated rural-\nurban development, and rural social development. ADB with other development partners are investing about $6 billion. \n14  ADB. 2019. Preparing Environmental and Rural Development Projects. Manila. and ADB. 2019.

This TA\u2019s \nknowledge work will inform the upcoming YREC program, currently under design with broader \ninterdepartmental engagement.  \n \n9.  ADB value addition in supporting strategic policy reforms, scaling innovation, and \nfacilitating knowledge spillover. This TA is the first to support the YREC program and is a \nflagship for PRC-ADB cooperation and partnership,18 building on the lessons learnt from the \nbroad-based ADB assistance in the YREB and rural vitalization (footnotes 12 and 13). Maximizing \nhigh-quality, green development and resilient ecological protection impacts in the Yellow River \nrequires  systems-thinking.  Strengthening  the  institutional  capacity,  policy  reforms  and \ngovernance will facilitate coherence and better incentives to generate social, economic, and \necological co-benefits in the longer-term. Scaling innovation can improve system management \nand respond to client needs more efficiently while reaching the last mile. Integrated models \npromoting rural-urban linkages and zero-waste green initiatives is beneficial for the economy, the \nenvironment and people\u2019s well-being. Strategic partnerships and multi-stakeholder platforms \nhave the potential to leverage private finance and promote nature-positive recovery approaches \nas  a  long-term  response  to  the  coronavirus  disease  pandemic.  Knowledge  services  are \nparamount to inform high-quality investments and multi-sector approaches. \n \nIII.  JUSTIFICATION FOR CLUSTER MODALITY \n \n10.  The TA cluster modality is the most relevant and efficient and comprehensive way to \ndeliver the proposed solutions with a holistic approach. This modality will provide the required \ntechnical assistance to meet the PRC-ADB\u2019s strategic and development priorities by maximizing \nimpacts  under  a  limited  budget  environment,  with  complementary  support  for  future  ADB \ninvestments. Also, the TA cluster will support strategic priority needs linked to ADB lending and \nnon-lending programs and leverage additional co-financing resources from ADB and external trust \nfunds, enabling greater knowledge sharing within and beyond the cluster\u2019s subprojects. Due to \nlimited budget resources the first phase of the TA cluster will address the sector and thematic \npriorities  for  rural  development  and  vitalization  and  ecosystem  restoration,  environmental \nprotection, and integrated water resources management. Subproject descriptions are provided in \nAppendix 2. Additional subprojects may be added to the TA cluster when financing resources are \navailable to support complementary interventions and enable policy and regulatory frameworks \nacross multiple sectors and thematic areas to deliver development solutions aligned with the other \nYREC sector and thematic priorities.  \n \nIV.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLUSTER \n \nA.  Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n11.  The TA cluster is aligned with the following impact: resilient ecological protection and \nsecurity in the Yellow River basin achieved.19 The TA cluster will have the following outcome: \nhigh-quality, green development opportunities in the Yellow River basin increased. \n \n18  ADB. 2018.

Knowledge sharing will be coordinated within the subprojects and the TA cluster through \nthe overarching YREC program, with the East Asia Regional Department (EARD) providing \noversight and guidance to all knowledge activities. A One-ADB approach will be applied to build \non  ADB  knowledge  strengths  through  the  Sustainable  Development  and  Climate  Change \nDepartment thematic and sector groups and the Department of Communications to enable cross \nregional  department  coordination  and  cooperation  for  wide  scale  dissemination  to  ADB\u2019s \ndeveloping member countries.  \n \nB.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA cluster is estimated to cost $2.18 million, of which $1.93 million will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). Detailed \ncost estimates and financing arrangements will be presented in each TA subproject proposal \nsubmitted for approval. During TA implementation additional financing resources will be identified \nfor cofinancing and will be mobilized to support ongoing TA subproject activities or additional TA \nsubprojects.  Cofinancing  will  be sought to  enhance  knowledge  dissemination  and  capacity \nbuilding to further complement output 3 and contribute to regional knowledge sharing.22 \n \n20 Regional Knowledge Sharing Initiative http://rksi.org/. \n21 Through the establishment of a Natural Capital Lab as a regional digital platform for sharing knowledge and building \npartnerships in the Asia-Pacific region.
