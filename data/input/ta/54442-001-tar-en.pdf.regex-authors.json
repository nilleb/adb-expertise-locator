INTRODUCTION\n1. The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  cluster  will  strengthen  debt\nsustainability  and  debt  management  practices  during  2021\u20132023  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,\nPakistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan\u2500four Asian Development Bank (ADB) developing member\ncountries (DMCs) that benefit from concessional assistance.1 The capacity building TA helps \nimplement the Sustainable Development Finance Policy (SDFP) and aligns with ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2030 priorities.2 This TA is anchored in operational priority 6, strengthening governance and \ninstitutional capacity, thus promoting enhanced public management and financial stability.3 The \nTA also helps implement Sustainable Development Goals 1, 5, 16, and 17 under Agenda 2030.4 \nII. ISSUES\n2. Threats to debt sustainability in Central and West Asia. During the coronavirus\ndisease (COVID-19) pandemic, an increase in sovereign debt in Central and West Asia added to\npre-pandemic debt vulnerabilities, threatening debt sustainability. The pandemic prompted an\nunprecedented fiscal response to support health systems and vulnerable households and firms.\nBefore the pandemic, the region\u2019s public and private debt was already high and rising, reaching\nan average of 43% of gross domestic product in the region\u2019s most vulnerable countries in 2019.5\nAlong with a sharp decline in output and ensuing fall in government revenues, the fiscal response\nto the COVID-19 crisis pushed the region\u2019s public debt close to 50% of gross domestic product in\n2020. As a result, most DMCs in the region will emerge from the pandemic with higher debt\nvulnerabilities. Record-high public debt levels will limit the room for further fiscal support, amid\nconstraints of borrowing costs or access to financing. Further, significant downside risks to\neconomic recovery exacerbate risks to debt sustainability in the medium term.\n3. Sustainable  public  finances  for  resilience  against  future  shocks.  Sound  debt\nmanagement and debt transparency are critical to keep borrowing costs in check, maintain debt\nsustainability, contain fiscal risks, and ensure that public debt does not crowd out critical social\nspending or threaten development gains. ADB proactively provided financing support to DMCs in\nCentral and West Asia during the pandemic, amid heightened fiscal risks stemming from a\nprotracted  economic  downturn  or  volatile  global  financial  conditions.  Further,  per  the\nConcessional  Lending  Policy  for  the  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  13  Period,  ADB  will\nstrengthen  its  support  for  debt  sustainability  by  aligning  with  the  SDFP  principles  of  the\nInternational Development Association (IDA).\n4. High external debt and underdeveloped domestic debt market. The total debt stock\nin the four DMCs is largely composed of external debt.6 Shifts in external financing conditions\nmay tip some of them into debt distress or lead to financial instability. If financial markets tighten\nabruptly, countries could see their borrowing costs spike, while local currency depreciation would\nadd to the costs of debt denominated in foreign currencies; both situations would lead to further\n1  ADB. 2020.

New York. \n5  The most vulnerable countries are defined as those belonging to the International Development Association (IDA) \ngroup, i.e., Afghanistan, Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. \n6  External debt as a share of total public debt in 2020: Kyrgyz Republic (84%), Pakistan (31%), Tajikistan (81%), \nUzbekistan (71%). ", "2 \nconcerns about sovereign debt sustainability.7 Countries that issue a significant volume of \ndomestic securities, such as Pakistan, need to monitor their investor base, in particular for \ndomestic bank and nonbank holders of securities, to align borrowing programs with investor \ndynamics and effective market risk transfer. Authorities may have insufficient information about \nthe investor base for government securities and limited dialogue with market players, despite \nevidence of some demand for longer-dated securities from institutional investors. Lack of a \nbenchmark building strategy reduces the predictability and transparency of bonds issuance and \nincreases difficulties in implementing their governments\u2019 medium-term debt strategy. \n5. Lack of transparency increases public exposure to fiscal risks. Contingent liabilities\nare one of the largest sources of fiscal risk in the four DMCs under this TA Fiscal risks stemming\nfrom state-owned enterprises (SOEs), public\u2013private partnerships, and the financial sector are\nnot adequately accounted for. Troubled SOEs often require government support to recapitalize\nand, in some cases, even assume their debt, thereby adversely impacting the government\u2019s fiscal\nposition. To finance large infrastructure projects, governments also often resort to contractual\narrangements  with  private  sector  entities that can  contain  provisions requiring  government\nguarantees. The deterioration of economic outlook has raised the likelihood that contingent\nliabilities may materialize, putting additional pressure on debt sustainability in the medium term.\nThese risks are exacerbated by the limited disclosure of debt reporting and debt statistics in the\ncontext of a comprehensive medium-term debt strategy. Debt statistics should cover public and\npublicly guaranteed debt, including SOEs\u2019 debt. There is a need to increase transparency in debt\nmanagement practices and strengthen staff capacity to report and analyze debt statistics.8\nIII. JUSTIFICATION FOR CLUSTER MODALITY\n6. The TA cluster modality will allow ADB to pool TA resources between subprojects in the\nfour DMCs and ensure that ADB requests a comparable level of effort of each DMC in institutional\nreforms to ensure debt sustainability and transparency. It will also increase flexibility by integrating\nnew specific TA requests, in line with the TA cluster\u2019s objectives, as they emerge. Further,\ngrouping debt-related TA subprojects under one TA cluster will help reap the benefits of synergies\nacross subprojects, minimizing transaction costs for ADB, solidifying its position as a key partner\nin the output areas covered by the proposal, and ensuring consistency in ADB\u2019s policy advice on\nthese key reform areas across the region.\nIV. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLUSTER\nA. Impact, Outcome, and Outputs\n7. The TA cluster is aligned with the following impact: governance and institutional capacity\nstrengthened. 9  The  TA  cluster  will  have  the  following  outcome:  debt  sustainability  and\ntransparency  improved.10 ADB  will  leverage  its  experience  to  better  support  and  promote\n7  The Group of Twenty (G20) debt service suspension initiative aims to help selected countries, including the four \nDMCs under this TA cluster, deal with financing pressures by allowing them to temporarily suspend debt payments \nto official creditors amid large rollover needs. \n8  Of the four DMCs covered under this TA, only Pakistan published a formal medium-term debt strategy (MTDS) \ndocument on the website of the Ministry of Finance. Uzbekistan published the MTDS report prepared during the joint \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank mission in October 2019. Tajikistan published a formal MTDS \ndocument for 2015\u20132017, which has not been updated since then. Authorities in the Kyrgyz Republic produce but \ndo not publish the MTDS or similar document. \n9  ADB. 2019. Strategy 2030 Operational Plan for Priority 6: Strengthening Governance and Institutional Capacity, \n2019\u20132024. Manila \n10 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. ", "3 \nsustainable borrowing practices and transparency in the four DMCs in three reform areas: (i) \nhelping DMCs deepen their domestic debt markets, (ii) enhancing debt transparency, and (iii) \nimplementing the SDFP in line with ADB\u2019s Concessional Assistance Policy for the ADF 13 Period \n(footnote 1). These areas are especially relevant in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and \nthe uncertain recovery that exacerbates debt vulnerabilities and may trigger additional fiscal risks \nassociated with the materialization of contingent liabilities. \n8. Output 1: Domestic debt markets developed. The excessive reliance on external\nborrowing increases vulnerability to exchange rate depreciation and global tightening, which\nthreatens financial stability. Deeper markets for domestic government securities also reduce\nexposure to debt rollover risks, strengthening the efficiency of fiscal and monetary policies.\nDeveloping  domestic  debt  markets  widens  government  access  to  funds,  lengthens  bond\nmaturities, and broadens the investor base. In turn, a diversified investor base helps increase\nmarket liquidity, reduces volatility in bond prices, and generates more competition and trading\nactivity, thereby reducing government borrowing costs. Further, a well-functioning government\nbond market (i) helps the government to achieve the medium-term targets of their desired debt\nportfolio by increasing the number of potential borrowing strategies, and (ii) facilitates bonds\nreopening and liability management operations to smoothen the debt redemption profile and\nreduce portfolio refinancing risk. Finally, regular and predictable issuance of government bonds\nhelps build up a reference yield curve for the private sector. The TA cluster will help enhance\ninvestor base diversification and form a stable demand profile for government securities and for\nlonger-term products by supporting the expansion of different types of products that could channel\ninvestments to strategic segments and support DMC growth. The TA cluster will also focus on (i)\nmarket development strategies to support market liquidity, and (ii) interbank money and swap\nmarkets development to further support bond market liquidity.\n9. Output 2: Fiscal risk management to improve debt transparency strengthened. The\nTA cluster will seek to strengthen the governments\u2019 institutional capacity to compile, record,\nmanage, and disseminate state-guaranteed debt statistics on SOEs, while also helping the\ngovernments to closely monitor SOE non-guaranteed debt and overall financial position. The TA\ncluster will also help governments monitor contingent liabilities, which are commonly used in large\ninfrastructure projects procured through the public\u2013private partnership modality; such projects\noften carry sizeable guaranteed debt or implicit commitments from the government. Ensuring\nadequate  identification,  monitoring,  and  reporting  of  contingent  liabilities  requires  close\ncoordination between the Ministry of Finance, line ministries, key SOEs, project implementation\nagencies, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), particularly the IMF\u2019s Caucasus, Central\nAsia,  and  Mongolia  Regional  Capacity  Development  Center.  The  TA  cluster  will  prioritize\nmonitoring contingent liabilities that may have the largest impact on the government budget and\nhelp authorities evaluate their fiscal risks. To complement these efforts, the TA cluster will help\nauthorities design and adopt measures that reduce public exposure to fiscal risk. Finally, to\nexpand efforts to increase debt transparency, the TA cluster will help develop institutional capacity\nto simulate contingent liabilities shocks in the debt sustainability analysis, allowing authorities to\ntest the resilience of their debt portfolios and more accurately assess the country\u2019s level of debt\ndistress.\n10. Output 3: Policy actions agreed under the Sustainable Development Finance Policy\ncomplied with. The replenishment of the ADF 13 for 2021\u20122024 occurred against mounting\npublic  debt  vulnerabilities  in  Central  and  West  Asia,  particularly  in  group  A  and  group  B ", "4 \ncountries.11 The rising levels of debt, combined with a shift towards less transparent, more \nexpensive, and riskier sources of financing, threaten debt sustainability across the region. As a \nresult, the ADF 13 targets debt sustainability as priority.12\u202fThe SDFP seeks to improve debt \ntransparency and debt management capacity in group A and group B DMCs by linking specific \nreforms to future concessional resource allocations. Key reform areas to mitigate the adverse \neffects  of  debt  accumulation  require  DMCs  to  continue  improving  their  macro-fiscal  policy \nframeworks, strengthen domestic resource mobilization, ensure efficient spending of scarce fiscal \nresources through improved public financial management systems, and strengthen their debt \nmanagement capacity. To implement policy actions identified under the SDFP, the TA cluster \nwill  coordinate  closely  with  government  authorities,  other  development  partners  (in \nparticular the IDA and the IMF), bilateral creditors, and civil society organizations that promote \ndebt transparency and accountability of public financial management systems. It will take into \naccount the context-specific institutional fragilities of each eligible DMC in Central and West Asia. \nThe TA cluster will help ADB country teams (i) identify policy actions, (ii) support achievement of \npolicy actions under the SDFP, and (iii) monitor and report progress towards achieving policy \nactions. \nB.  Cost and Financing\n11. The TA cluster is estimated to cost $3,125,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by\nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 7). Detailed cost estimates and financing\narrangements will be presented in each TA subproject proposal submitted for approval.\n12. For each TA subproject, the government will provide counterpart support in the form of\ncounterpart staff, office supplies, secretarial assistance, domestic transportation, and other in-\nkind contributions.\nC. Implementation Arrangements\n13. ADB will administer the TA cluster. The Public Management, Financial Sector, and Trade\nDivision of ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department (CWRD) will administer and coordinate\nimplementation, monitor measures to assess accomplishment towards TA cluster objectives, and\nenhance knowledge capture and dissemination. The Public Management, Financial Sector, and\nTrade Division will coordinate closely with CWRD\u2019s Regional Cooperation Division, resident\nmissions, and ADB\u2019s Strategy and Policy Department in the implementation of the TA cluster.\nEach TA cluster subproject proposal will be submitted for approval following the business process\nfor knowledge and support TA cluster processing. The Director General, CWRD will approve each\nTA subproject, regardless of its amount and the TA subproject\u2019s risk category. A no-objection\nletter will be obtained before starting any undertaking in a DMC. Management and the Board will\nbe informed of the approval of TA subprojects as part of the quarterly summary report. Subproject\nactivities will start only after approval. Implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 1.\nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements for the Technical Assistance Cluster \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  December 2021\u2013December 2023 \nfor the TA cluster \n11 In CWRD, group A countries are Afghanistan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan; group B countries are Pakistan \nand Uzbekistan. \n12 The objective of IDA\u2019s SDFP is to incentivize countries to move towards transparent, sustainable financing and to \npromote coordination between IDA and other creditors in support of recipient countries\u2019 efforts.
