The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has requested that the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) provide technical assistance (TA) for managing railway passenger \noperations more efficiently. The Fact-Finding Mission visited the PRC in September 2006 and \nreached an understanding with the Government on TA objectives, scope, terms of reference, \ncost estimates, financing plan, and implementation arrangements. The TA is included in the \nADB 2006 country program for the PRC.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Economic growth in the PRC has been rapid over the past 2 decades, reaching 10.2% in \n2005. The rapid economic growth has resulted in 9% annual growth in passenger transport and \n7.4% growth in freight transport from 1978 to 2005. During that period, railway freight grew from \n535 billion tons/kilometer (km) to 2,073 billion tons/km, for an annual growth rate of 5.1%, and \npassenger traffic grew at 6.6% annually, increasing from 109 billion passenger-km to 606 billion \npassenger-km. Despite this growth in traffic, railways lost modal share for both freight and \npassengers. By end 2005, the PRC\u2019s railway system comprised 75,438 route-km, which carried \nabout a third of the PRC\u2019s freight and passenger traffic.  \n \n3.  The Government\u2019s railway development policy focuses on (i) removing constraints and \nexpanding the railway system, (ii) encouraging the construction of joint venture local railways to \npromote the development of local economies, (iii) improving the railway system\u2019s efficiency by \nusing new technology and modern management tools for planning and operations, (iv) reducing \noperating subsidies through appropriate pricing and commercialization of services, (v) initiating \ninstitutional  and  structural  reforms  to  increase  Ministry  of  Railways  (MOR)  autonomy  and \naccountability, and (vi) encouraging nongovernment investment in infrastructure and related \nservices.  \n \n4.  The Tenth Five-Year Plan (2001\u20132005) identified railway development as a priority and \nenvisaged (i) building 6,000 km of new lines to access previously unserved areas, bringing the \nnetwork length to 74,000 km; (ii) providing 3,000 km of double lines and electrifying 5,000 km of \nkey lines to increase capacity; and (iii) increasing operating speeds on 5,000 km to reach a total \nlength of speed-improved lines of 15,000 km. An investment of CNY270 billion was envisaged \nfor capital construction. By the end of 2005, an investment of CNY308 billion had been made for \ncapital construction, which included (i) constructing 6,458 km of new lines, (ii) providing 3,275 \nkm of double lines, and (iii) electrifying 6,259 km of tracks.  \n \n5.  In 2004, the State Council approved the new Railway Development Plan covering the \nperiod up to 2020. The plan seeks to expand the railway network from 74,000 km in 2004 to \n100,000 km by 2020. Increasing train speed is identified as a major goal. Train speeds will be \nraised to over 200 km per hour on the trunk network by 2020. Priority will be given to developing \nrailways in unserved areas and regions that lack transport and have remained less developed. \nThe route network length will increase by 16,000 km in the western region of the PRC to reach a \nnetwork length of 40,000 km by 2020. To improve operational efficiency, MOR has initiated \naction to separate passenger and freight trains on key rail corridors.2 \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 19 June 2006. \n2  ADB is financing the first passenger-dedicated corridor under ADB. 2005. Report and Recommendation of the \nPresident to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Zhengzhou\u2013Xi\u2019an \nRailway Project. Manila (Loan 2182-PRC, approved on 22 October). \n ", " 2 \n6.  The  Eleventh  Five-Year  Plan  (2006\u20132010)  continues  the  emphasis  on  railway \ndevelopment  and  seeks  to  accelerate  railway  construction.  The  plan,  which  is  under \npreparation,  envisages  (i) constructing  17,000  km  of  new  lines  so  that  the  network  length \nreaches a total of 92,000 route-km and (ii) double tracking and electrifying 45% of the network \nlength.  The  plan seeks  to  (i) build  a  dedicated  passenger  railway  network  by  constructing \npassenger-dedicated  lines  (PDLs);  (ii)  develop  coal  transport  corridors  by  increasing  the \ncapacity of the existing lines; (iii) expand the railway network in the poor western region to \n34,000 km; (iv) build international corridors at the borders in the southwest and northwest; and \n(v)  develop  a  countrywide  intermodal  container  network.  Preliminary  estimates  suggest \ninvestments of CNY1.5 trillion, or about $190 billion over the next 5-year period.  \n \n7.  ADB's strategy for the PRC railway sector focuses on (i) expanding the railway system \nby constructing new lines in unserved areas that are less-developed and poor; (ii) modernizing \nand increasing the capacity to improve transport efficiency on key routes of the national railway \nsystem;  (iii)  commercializing  railway  operations  to  sustain  efficient  operations,  and \n(iv) increasing railway competitiveness in the transport sector through restructuring and reform.  \n \n8.  ADB  is  the  lead  funding  agency  in  the  PRC  railway  sector  and  has  focused  on \ndeveloping railways in less-developed inland provinces to promote growth and reduce poverty. \nADB provided 13 loans, totaling about $2.6 billion, to finance the construction of about 1,921 km \nof provincial railways and 4,597 km of national railway projects. The World Bank has since 1984 \nprovided 10 loans totaling over $2.4 billion for (i) nine national railway projects to expand railway \ncapacity  on  high-priority  corridors,  modernizing  technology,  and  strengthening  institutional \ncapabilities and (ii) one local railway project. From 1979 to 1997, Japan provided about Y558 \nbillion for 15 railway projects to expand rail transportation capacity.   \n \n9.  Policy dialogue has been a significant component of ADB assistance to the railway \nsector and has effectively complemented lending operations. A total of 12 TA projects have \nbeen  provided  to  PRC  railways  since  1989  for  (i)  policy  reforms,  (ii)  the  institutional \ndevelopment  of  local  railways,  (iii)  strengthening  commercial  and  business  operations,  (iv) \nmarketing  and  business  development,  (v)  tariff  setting  with  improved  cost  recovery,  (vi) \ndeveloping human resources, and (vii) improving the financial management and accounting \nsystems.  Since  2002,  ADB  has  enhanced  its  policy  dialogue  with  MOR,  the  National \nDevelopment Reform Commission (NDRC), and the Ministry of Finance (MOF), and there is \nbroad agreement that reform is an engine to further develop railways. The World Bank and the \nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have also been engaged in \ndialogues on many policy issues concerning PRC railways. The Railway Development Plan \n(2004) sets major goals and the reform agenda up to 2020 for PRC railway development. This \nplan seeks to (i) study and learn from worldwide experience, (ii) clearly identify core operations \nand separate core from non-core transportation businesses, (iii) rationalize and reduce staff, (iv) \nreform the railway investment and financing system, and (v) establish specialized transportation \ncompanies. \n \n10.  Even though in the recent years PRC railways have made significant progress and \nnotable  achievements,  they  are  unable  to  meet  increasing  demand  for  passenger \ntransportation.  Growth  in  passenger  transportation  has  been  faster  than  growth  in  freight \ntransport (para. 2.). High economic growth rates and increasing urbanization are the two major \ncauses for this high passenger transport demand. With per capita GDP expected to grow at 7% \nand reach $3,000 by 2020, from the current level of $1,700, and with 60% of the rural population \n(400 million) expected to move to urban areas in the same period, demand for increased \ntransportation capacity and quality of service will increase significantly. Even with 6.6% growth \nin the period 1978\u20132005, the railways\u2019 share of total passenger transport has gone down, as \nroad and air passenger transport has witnessed higher growth rates. Improved road and air \n ", "    3 \nnetworks following huge investments in the two subsectors in recent years help explain these \nhigh growth rates. However, PRC railways are more fuel efficient and environmentally friendly \nthan road and air transport. They have an enviable safety record and are more affordable. Rail \nis  a  preferred  mode  of  transport  for  long-distance  travel,  but  there  are  serious  capacity \nconstraints.  \n \n11.  Given  all  of  this,  the  Government  has  adopted  an  aggressive  plan  for  developing \nrailways, including the development of a dedicated passenger network, in the Eleventh Five \nYear  Plan.  MOR  has  developed  an  ambitious  plan  to  develop  12,000  km  of  dedicated \npassenger railway network by 2020. ADB has supported the concept of a dedicated passenger \nnetwork in the PRC railway system and is financing the Zhengzhou-Xi\u2019an PDL, the construction \nof which started in September 2005. MOR has started building another 10 PDLs, and 5,000 km \nof the dedicated passenger network will be completed by the end of the Eleventh Five Year Plan \n(2010).  \n \n12.  Developing a dedicated passenger network is a new concept for PRC railways, and \nmanaging such a network is different from managing a conventional railway system that runs \nboth freight and passenger services on the same tracks. MOR has no experience in operating \nand managing such a network and is therefore looking for international experience and best \npractices to support managing it efficiently. A number of key issues need to be considered. One \nis train operation planning for dedicated corridors, which is different from the train operation \nplanning  for  mixed  traffic  lines  and  corridors;  safety,  reliability,  and  punctuality  are  key \nparameters to decide the number of trains that can run between destinations and how they can \nrun. The method, basis, process, and models for planning train operations on a network and \norigin-destination basis, as well as planning of train links, traffic flows, train servicing, link plans, \nand other operating parameters for PDLs, are different from those of conventional railway lines. \nA related safety issue is the need for a decision-support system for the day-to-day management \nof  operations.  The  contents,  organization  methods,  implementation  methods,  processes  of \nrelated  works,  management  regulations,  setting  up  and  functioning  of  the  framework,  and \ncustomer relations management methods for conventional train operations are much different \nfrom those of dedicated operations. As MOR has no experience in these areas, it is seeking to \nlearn from similar experiences in other countries.  \n \n13.  Another issue is the viability of the dedicated passenger operations. MOR has adopted a \nseparate  institutional  structure  for  these  entities,  and  each  PDL  has  been  formed  into  a \nseparate, legally independent, financially viable joint venture entity.3 This approach is quite \ndifferent from the approach adopted by MOR for the national network, where cross-subsidies \nand distortions exist in pricing, and where tariffs are set by the Government. To make these \nentities commercially viable, pricing policies and tariff strategies need to be adopted that are \nvery different from those of the conventional network. Concepts such as full cost recovery, \nflexible pricing mechanisms, basing tariffs on market conditions, and different tariff structures for \ndifferent quality of services are some of the options that need to be examined. PDLs will cater to \ndifferent sections of society and compete with conventional railways, airways, and roads. Given \nthe intense competition that is likely to emerge from other transportation modes, an effective \nsales and marketing strategy will determine where the traffic goes. Again, marketing is not an \narea of strength for conventional railways, where most of the traffic is captive and bulk, requiring \nvery  little  marketing  or  sales  effort  from  the  railways.  MOR  therefore  seeks  to  research \ninternational experiences, learn from them, and suitably adopt best practices over its system. A \nrelated issue for the efficient operation of passenger services is the efficacy of such supporting \ntransport services as on-board train services, passenger amenities, station facilities, information \n                                                 \n3  Developing an appropriate institutional structure is supported by consulting services under the ADB-financed \nZhengzhou\u2013Xi\u2019an Railway Project.  ", " 4 \nsystems, reservation systems, etc. For conventional train operations, these services are not  \nvery important, but in the case of dedicated premium services they can determine customer \nchoice and passenger flows. \n \n14.  Addressing these issues is critical to achieving safe, reliable, and commercially viable \ndedicated passenger operations on PRC railways. Given ADB\u2019s role in developing the concept \nof a dedicated passenger network, and that the commercial operation of the first PDL (Beijing\u2013\nTianjin) is expected to start in 2008, the Government and MOR sought ADB assistance to help \nPRC railways research international experiences and best practices for these new concepts, \nexamine how they can be adopted to PRC railways, and make recommendations for MOR to \nimplement.   \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n15.  The impact of the proposed TA is an efficient, reliable, and competitive passenger \nrailway transport system developed in the PRC. The outcome of TA will be a strategy that can \nbe adopted by MOR to manage railway passenger operations more efficiently. TA will (i) review \ncurrent  practices  adopted  by  MOR  for  managing  passenger  operations,  (ii) research  best \ninternational practices and experiences, and (iii) recommend actions that should be realistic for \nthe  Government  and  MOR  to  implement.  Appendix  1  gives  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework. The study will use the experience of other railways and involve active participation \nof railway management. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n16.  International consultants, supported by national consultants, will be engaged to help the \nGovernment  prepare  the  recommendations  and  a  plan  that  MOR  can  implement.  The \nconsultants will  \n(i)  review development plans of the dedicated passenger network and PDLs and \nprepare guidelines for the plan for passenger operations;  \n(ii)  reviewsales and marketing strategies adopted by similar railways and prepare a \nstrategy to be adopted by MOR for PDLs;  \n(iii)  review  pricing  and  tariff  policies  for  passenger  operations,  research  similar \ninternational experience, and recommend  appropriate pricing policies and tariff \nstructures that can be adopted by MOR; \n(iv)  research international experiences in developing such support services as on-\nboard  train  services,  station  services,  the  provision  of  passenger  amenities, \nticketing, and passenger information systems on similar railways, recommending \nan appropriate system that can be adopted by MOR; and  \n(v)  research and review decision-support systems for the day-to-day management \ndecisions  made  while  operating  dedicated  passenger  railway  operations, \nrecommending suitable decision-support systems that can be adopted by MOR. \n \n17.  TA will be undertaken in close consultation with the Government, MOR, and other \nrelevant agencies. The study will build upon ADB\u2019s ongoing policy dialogue and the outputs of \nrecent  TA  provided  for  policy  reform  support.4  It  will  consider  all  previous  studies  by  the \nGovernment, ADB, World Bank, OECD, other multilateral agencies, and bilateral agencies.

The study is ongoing. \n \n ", "    5 \nwill involve analytical and innovative research; fieldwork; training; and stakeholder consultations \nwith the Government, private sector, user groups, and international development partners. \n \n18.  Key activities will include a review of existing studies by MOR, the Government, and \nother multilateral institutions; data analysis; and consultation with other stakeholders, including \nMOF and government officials. An international training program with participation from relevant \ndepartments  will  be  organized  to  learn  from  the  experiences  of  railways  overseas.  Two \nworkshops, one each at inception and the interim stage of TA implementation, will be organized \nto discuss and review the findings of the study, and a seminar will be organized at the final \nstage to disseminate TA findings.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n19.  The total cost of TA is estimated at $780,000. TA will be financed as a grant in the \namount of $600,000 from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. MOR will finance the remaining $180,000, \nwhich  will  be  used  to  cover  office  accommodation  and  the  counterpart  staff  required  to \nimplement TA. The detailed cost estimate is in Appendix 2.    \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  MOR, as the Executing Agency, will be responsible for supervising and monitoring TA \nactivities. A steering committee comprising representatives of relevant departments of MOR will \nbe set up to oversee implementation and provide guidance and direction to the consultants. In \naddition, MOR will appoint a project coordinator who will supervise and coordinate day-to-day \nTA  activities,  including  monitoring  progress,  resolving  problems,  arranging  meetings,  and \nliaising with the government agencies concerned. To facilitate the work of the consultants, and \nto ensure that MOR benefits from their experience, MOR will provide adequate counterpart staff \nwith relevant work experience during TA implementation. MOR will also provide policy guidance \nto the consultants. Workshops and a seminar will be held to review findings at the inception, \ninterim, and final stages of TA. These meetings will include representatives of MOR, MOF, other \nrelevant agencies, ADB, and the consultants. A final report will be published at TA completion. \n \n21.  A consulting firm will be engaged by ADB using simplified technical proposal procedures \nand the quality- and cost-based selection method in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2005) and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging national \nconsultants. TA will require about 18 person-months of international consulting services and \nabout 20 person-months of national consulting services to carry out the terms of reference \n(Appendix 3). The international consultants will have expertise in the following fields of the railway \npassenger transport: (i) railway transportation planning, (ii) sales and marketing, (iii) pricing policy \nand tariff issues, (iv) related transport services for railways, and (v) railway management decision-\nsupport systems. The national consultants will have expertise in the following fields of railway \npassenger transport: (i) train operation planning, (ii) sales and marketing strategies, (iii) pricing \nand tariff issues, (iv) transport services, and (v) decision-support systems for managing railways. \nTA  is  expected  to  commence  in  February  2007  and  be  completed  by  September  2007. \nProcurement of equipment, supplies, and materials by consultants under TA will follow ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2006). The equipment will be turned over to MOR after TA completion. \n \nIII.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Managing Railway Passenger Operations \nMore Efficiently, and hereby reports this action to the Board.
