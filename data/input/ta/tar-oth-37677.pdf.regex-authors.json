The technical assistance (TA)1 will support a joint effort of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB), Japan Bank of International Cooperation (JBIC), and World Bank to produce a study for \nestablishing a balanced approach to the provision of infrastructure in the medium term. The \ndecision  to  jointly  pursue  the  study  is  a  result  of  consultation  between  the  three  sponsor \ninstitutions. The  World  Bank  needs  to  reassess  its  strategy  for  infrastructure  development \nbecause of its renewed focus on infrastructure lending in recent years. For JBIC and ADB, \nwhich  have  maintained  relatively  strong  presence  in  the  sector,  the  study  will  provide  an \nopportunity to chart out, in broad concert with major stakeholders, a strategy for ensuring \nefficient and effective infrastructure service provision, contributing to economic growth while \nensuring that social and environmental goals are met.   \n \n2.  The study is focused on East Asia and includes Cambodia, People\u2019s Republic of China, \nIndonesia,  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic,  Malaysia,  Mongolia,  Papua  New  Guinea, \nPhilippines, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Viet Nam, and the Pacific island countries.  Lessons learned \nfrom several Asian countries such as Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand will also \nbe considered. The TA framework is shown in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  According to a recent study of global trends of private participation in infrastructure,2 the \nshare of private infrastructure financing in East Asia and the Pacific grew from about $14.6 \nbillion in 1993, peaked at $41.3 billion in 1997, and declined sharply to $12.2 billion during the \nfinancial crisis in 1998. Recovery of investment levels has been painfully slow, so that in 2001, \ninvestments in the region have recovered only up to pre-1994 levels. This trend is mirrored in \nthe entire developing world. Official development assistance to infrastructure in developing \ncountries has also been declining since 1995, stemming largely from a predominant expectation \nthat private funds would bridge the large infrastructure financing and service delivery gaps in the \n1990s. \n \n4.  Meanwhile  in  ADB,  infrastructure  continued  to  be  an  important  area  of  operations. \nDuring the last 5 years, about $10 billion of ADB resources were channeled to public sector \nloans  for  infrastructure.  Despite  some  decline  in  the  share  of  loan  resources  going  into \ninfrastructure immediately after the Asian financial crisis, ADB continued to be strongly involved \nin infrastructure development in the region. ADB\u2019s public sector loan for infrastructure was 32% \nof its total portfolio in 1998 and increased to about 46% in 2002. To date, more than half of \nADB\u2019s $1.2 billion private sector operations have been channeled to infrastructure.3 To support \nsuch  presence  in  the  sector,  TA  resources  devoted  solely  to  energy,  transport,  and \ncommunications amounted to about $316 million in the last 5 years. However, financing from \nADB alone, or official development assistance, can only cover a small portion of the amount that \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) need for financing infrastructure. \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 25 August 2003. \n2  World Bank. 2003. Private Participation in Infrastructure: Trends in Developing Countries in 1990-2001. Public- \nPrivate Infrastructure Advisory Facility.  Washington, DC. \n3  ADB defines infrastructure to include energy, transport, and communications for its public sector loans.  For ADB\u2019s \nprivate sector operations, infrastructure is defined consistent with International Standard Industrial Classification \ncodes to include electricity (power plants), collection, purification and distribution of water, land transport, including \ntransport  via  pipelines,  air  transport,  supporting  and  auxiliary  transport/travel  agencies,  post  and \ntelecommunications, education and health, and social infrastructure.  ", "2 \n5.  The TA will support the larger effort to produce a study on infrastructure provision and \nfinancing  in  East  Asia.  A  focus  on  East  Asia  is  appropriate  because  it  experienced  a \nphenomenal increase in activities related to infrastructure development during 1990\u20131997 and \nsuffered a precipitous decline thereafter. The wealth of lessons offered by this experience, and \nthe need to address the continuing challenges, provide an opportunity for building strategic \nconsensus on the way forward. The outcome of the joint effort is expected to have far-ranging \nimplications on infrastructure provision in the region and in other parts of the developing world. \n \n6.  The scope of the joint study will include (i) reviewing lessons learned covering the many \nthematic issues affecting infrastructure development (para. 11); (ii) addressing strategic issues \nsuch as the direction of infrastructure provision and financing in the wake of the global downturn \nin financing for infrastructure (official and private flows) and the lingering effects of the Asian \nfinancial  crisis;  (iii)  reviewing  the  experience  in  private  sector  infrastructure  financing;  (iv) \nassessing  future  requirements;  and  (v)  recommending  more  balanced  and  sustainable \napproaches  for  infrastructure  development.  The  study  is  expected  to  help  build  among \nstakeholders a consensus on strategic directions in infrastructure development in East Asia. \nThe study is also expected to add value by reviewing the state of the infrastructure business in \nEast Asia. Recent discussions between the three participating institutions suggest limiting the \nstudy  to  (i)  economic  infrastructure,  especially  power  and  piped  gas;  (ii)  transport  and \ncommunications; (iii) water and sanitation, in urban and rural areas; and (iv) hydropower and \nwater reservoirs. The study will exclude upstream oil and gas, and other extractive industries.  \n \n7.  ADB participation in the TA is expected to support its operations focus and provide clear \nrecommendations on planning interventions in the sector to support ADB\u2019s overarching goal of \npoverty reduction and contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs). The study process is designed to involve different groups of stakeholders to arrive at a \nbroad consensus on the future course of actions to increase investments in the infrastructure \nsectors. ADB\u2019s emphasis will be to look at the broad strategies for infrastructure development \nwithin the context of ADB\u2019s experience and on engaging individual DMCs in this process. The \nTA will benefit ADB in terms of enhanced collaboration with DMCs at the country strategy and \nsector level and improved coordination of inputs and assistance with other funding agencies. \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s general approach to infrastructure development for DMCs has been relatively \nsuccessful. The study is a valuable opportunity to develop appropriate models and solutions to \ninfrastructure  development  and  to  systematically  synthesize  learning  from  ADB\u2019s  general \napproach. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  The study will generate practical guidance for policy makers, multilateral development \nbanks, and other financing agencies on how to engage in infrastructure service provision and \nfinancing in the context of individual DMCs and in light of the lessons learned. The study is \nexpected  to  develop  a  balanced  approach  to  public  and  private  solutions  to  infrastructure \ndevelopment  by  helping  define  the  boundaries  of  public  policy  and  public  and  private \ninvestments.  Consultative  activities  with  decision  makers,  development  partners,  and  civil \nsociety will seek to achieve broad consensus on the study findings. \n \n10.  Under  the  study,  the  TA  will  complement  ADB  staff  resources  to  support  (i)  the \npreparation of the main report, with JBIC and the World Bank; (ii) review of the technical ", "    3 \nworking papers for study focus areas that are initially identified; (iii) the preparation of at least \ntwo technical working papers for which ADB will take the lead; and (iv) participation in and \nconduct of three consultative workshops and one regional conference. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  Recent  discussion  and  coordination  between  the  sponsor  institutions  identified  the \nfollowing key themes for the study: (i) the importance of infrastructure in economic development; \n(ii) the linkage between economic growth and poverty reduction and the MDGs; (iii) an overview \nof the recent history of infrastructure provision in East Asia; (iv) the experience with private \nparticipation  in  infrastructure  in  the  region;  (v)  decentralization  and  urbanization;  (vi) \ncompetitiveness  and  regional  integration;  (vii)  environmental  and  health  concerns;  (viii) \nassessment of infrastructure requirements in the region; (ix) appropriate roles of public and \nprivate actors in infrastructure planning; (x) financing, management, and service provision; (xi) \nregulation of infrastructure providers, whether public or private; (xii) financial issues, including \nfacilitating domestic financing mobilization; and (xiii) an appropriate balance between growth \nand access, and meeting affordability and social concerns. \n \n12.  The main report will contain the main conclusions and recommendations of the study, \nincorporating the findings of the technical working papers and the consultative process so as to \nbuild credibility, and ownership around the study\u2019s strategic recommendations. The technical \nworking papers will correspond closely with the key themes (para. 11), and will provide the \nbackground necessary for the main report to propose strategic directions for future sector \ndevelopment. The papers will also draw on ADB expertise, including previous analytical work,4 \nthrough the mechanisms described in Section D, Implementation Arrangements. \n \n13.  The two technical working papers for which ADB will take the lead will include (i) a \nreview of the importance of infrastructure in development, economic growth, poverty reduction, \nmaking  explicit  linkages  between  infrastructure  development,  poverty  reduction,  and  the \nachievement  of  MDGs;  and  (ii)  a  discussion  of  issues  on  competitiveness  and  regional \nintegration, covering intra- and inter-regional trade and investment and focusing on \u201csoft issues\u201d \nsuch as logistics, customs, and red tape. The first working paper will (i) collate the literature on \nthe topic; (ii) discuss international experience with a focus on the role that infrastructure played \nin the \u201cEast Asian Miracle\u201d and relevant development experience from Japan, Republic of \nKorea,  Malaysia,  and  Thailand;  and  (iii)  recommend  appropriate  frameworks  for  planning \ninfrastructure interventions with clear linkages to growth, poverty reduction, and the MDGs. The \nsecond working paper will draw on ongoing work focusing on the coordination of regional \ninfrastructure networks, particularly in energy and transport. \n \n14.  The consultative workshops and conference are designed to support the participative \nprocess within the study. The first workshop will be held in Manila in January 2004 to obtain \nfeedback from technical experts on the study coverage, important issues, and possible areas of \nfurther focus. A second workshop will be held after substantial completion of the major working \npapers and the draft main report. Another consultative workshop in the non-East Asia region will \nbe held to extract relevant experience and lessons and to broaden the opportunity for sharing \n                                                 \n4  Including ADB. 2000.

", "4 \nstrategies and decision frameworks. A regional conference will be held to present the final \nresults of the main study. \n \n15.  The study will be challenging in breadth and in the consensus building necessary to \nrecommend strategic directions. The study is expected to follow a process approach because it \nis envisaged as a significant learning exercise with dimensions of constituency building and \nadvocacy. Thus, flexibility will be needed to allow new approaches to be incorporated during the \ncourse of the study and to facilitate the involvement of three sponsor institutions. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 equivalent, comprising $430,000 in \nforeign exchange costs and $70,000 equivalent in local currency costs. The TA will be financed \non a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The TA will be coordinated within ADB by \nthe  Infrastructure  and  Finance  Division  of  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development \nDepartment with a task manager supported by a small group of infrastructure experts. A high \nlevel  advisory  group  within  ADB  has  been  set  up,  with  infrastructure  directors  from  the \noperations  departments  and  representatives  of  the  Economics  and  Research  Department, \nOperations Evaluation Department, and Strategy and Policy Department. The advisory group \nwill play a key role in harnessing ADB\u2019s institutional knowledge and in building ownership for the \nstudy results within ADB. The TA task manager will ensure that the advisory group is well \nbriefed and that the group\u2019s inputs are sought especially during major study milestones.  \n \n18.  The three sponsor institutions will also organize a core team, with one member from \neach institution plus one full-time team leader. The core team will have the primary responsibility \nfor drafting the terms of reference of the working papers, for commissioning the papers and \nundertaking quality control of the various outputs. The team will produce and oversee the final \nmain report and play a key role in the consultation and dissemination activities throughout the \nregion. \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over 20 months starting in November 2003. The expected \ncompletion date is June 2005. The TA will involve about 12 person-months of international and \nabout 18 person-months of domestic consulting services. A team of international and domestic \nconsultants will be selected and engaged by ADB on an individual basis in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the \nselection and engagement of domestic consultants. An outline of scope of work for consulting \nservices is provided in Appendix 3.  \n \n20.  All the working papers, draft reports, and recommendations will be submitted to ADB, \nJBIC, and World Bank, at least 4 weeks before the planned workshops/conference. The final \nreport will incorporate conference discussions and results and will be disseminated through print \nand  other modes  of  publication  to  local  constituencies in  DMCs  and  funding  agencies,  to \npromote  understanding  of  the  findings  and  the  options  for  effective  and  sustainable \ninfrastructure development (Appendix 4). \n ", "    5 \nIV.

The study will adopt a process approach to implementation. There is an initial consensus \nbetween  the  three  sponsor  institutions  that  working  papers  will  be  closely  coordinated, \nespecially at the conceptualization stage. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will take lead on \ntwo themes. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and World Bank will support \npreparation of the remaining technical working papers. Terms of reference, study frameworks, \nstudy  materials, and  related  documents  pertaining  to  the  cooperative  effort  will  be  shared \nbetween ADB, JBIC, and World Bank. \n2.  The international consultants will include experts on infrastructure economics, such as \nenergy, transport, network and logistics, public-private provision of infrastructure, and rural and \nurban infrastructure. The consultants will also have cross-sectoral expertise with issues of \ngovernance, regulation, and sustainability (e.g., affordability, asset management and pricing, \nurbanization and political decentralization, shifting centers of competitiveness, greater regional \nintegration, decentralization, social and environmental issues, and poverty reduction, as these \nrelate to infrastructure development). \nInternational Consultants (about 12 person-months) \n3.  The  study  coordinator  within  ADB  (about  6.0  person-months  intermittent  over  20 \nmonths) will be an infrastructure economist with at least 10 years of experience in at least two \nmajor infrastructure sectors. The coordinator will have an excellent grasp of the key themes to \nbe covered by the main study, as described in para. 11 of the main technical assistance paper. \nThe study coordinator will lead ADB\u2019s consulting team.  \n \n4.  The coordinator will be assisted in producing ADB\u2019s deliverables in the main report and \nthe technical working papers for about 1 person-month each by the following international \nconsultant: energy expert, transport expert, urban and rural infrastructure expert, infrastructure \nand  poverty  reduction  specialist,  public-private  infrastructure  specialist,  and  infrastructure \nnetworks  and  logistics  expert.  The  division  of  responsibilities  between  the  experts  will  be \ndetailed after the constitution of the core team and upon agreement on the terms of reference \nfor each technical working paper. \n \nDomestic Consultants (estimated input, 18 person-months) \n5.  Two domestic infrastructure economists (about 8 person-months each) will support the \nwork of the international consultants, including providing research assistance, preparing country \nand short sector background materials, and assisting with organizing the consultative activities \nunder the TA.  \n \n6.  An editor (about 2 person-months) will be employed to help package ADB\u2019s sections of \nthe final main report, edit the technical working paper reports for publication, and prepare for \npublic release the materials to be used in the consultative workshops and conferences. \n \n ", "10  Appendix 4 \nOUTLINE OF THE FINAL REPORT \n \n  The final joint report is expected to broadly follow the tentative outline presented below:  \nI.
