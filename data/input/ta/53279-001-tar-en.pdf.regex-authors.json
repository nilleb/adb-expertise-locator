The Government of India has identified development of the power sector as a  focus area \nto promote sustained industrial growth.1 To boost the Indian power sector, the Government of \nIndia has initiated the following: (i) a draft amendment to Electricity Act 2003 introduced in \nSeptember 2018, which discusses separation of content and carriage, direct benefit transfer of \nsubsidy, 24X7 power supply as an obligation, penalties on violation of power purchase agreement, \nsetting up smart meter and prepaid meters along with regulations related to the same; (ii) release \nof roadmap to achieve 175 gigawatts (GW) capacity in renewable energy by 2022, which includes \n100 GW of solar power and 60 GW of wind power; (iii) Ujwal Discoms Assurance Yojana launched \nby the Government of India to encourage operational and financial turnaround of state-owned \npower distribution companies, with aims to reduce aggregate technical and commercial losses to \n15% by FY2019; (iv) Integrated Power Development Scheme for strengthening subtransmission \nand distribution network in urban areas; (v) Dindayal Upadhya Gram Jyoti Yojana scheme for \nstrengthening the rural distribution network, separation of agricultural feeders, rural electrification \nand metering of distribution transformers and feeders; and (vi) Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har \nGhar Yojana\u2013Saubhagya scheme for electrifying all unelectrified households by 2019. For the \npast 4 years,2 India\u2019s (i) ranking on \u201cEase of Doing Business-Getting Electricity\u201d jumped to 24 in \n2014 from 137 in 2018; and (ii) energy deficit reduced to 0.7% of the electricity demand from 4.2% \nin 2014. However, there are still many states lagging in power generation, transmission, and \ndistribution due to lack of investments. In the distribution sector, these states are grappling with \nsevere technical and commercial losses which seriously impact on the financial stability of the \ncompanies. Lack of generation capacity addition and congestion in transmission network are the \nother constraints faced by these states. To address these issues, the Government of India is now \nfocusing on supporting these states to improve their power infrastructure.  \n \n2.  In line with pillar 2 of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for India, 2018\u20132022, ADB\u2019s \noperation in the energy sector in India is increasingly focusing on lagging states to support \ninclusive  economic growth  and  reduce  disparities  in  poverty  rates  across  states.  Areas  of \nintervention identified for lagging states include (i) distribution renovation and modernization; (ii) \ntransmission  strengthening;  (iii)  generation  upgrading  and  rehabilitation,  among  others.  To \nstrengthen their power sector, small and low-income states, such as Meghalaya, Tripura, and \nUttarakhand have submitted or are preparing preliminary project reports for endorsement by the \nGovernment of India for ADB financing. However, these states will have difficulty in meeting \ngovernment  and  ADB  financing  requirements  given  their  lack  of  competency  in  (i)  project \nidentification,  design  and  cost-benefit  analysis;  (ii)  incorporating  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards  in  project  design;  (iii)  meeting  project  readiness;  (iv)  preparing  procurement \ndocuments; and (v) financial and economic analysis. In addition, project implementation and \noverall portfolio performance in these states also need to be improved. \n \n3.  The  proposed  transaction  technical  assistance  (TA)  facility  will  help  the  executing \nagencies  (EA)  and  implementing  agencies  (IA)  meet  government  and  ADB  financing \nrequirements by supporting project preparation, increasing project readiness, building capacity in \nproject implementation and overall portfolio management. The TA will support the following \n                                                \n1  Ministry of Power, Government of India.  \n2  India Brand Equify Foundation. \n \n ", "2   \nensuing projects3 and provide initial implementation support after project approval to ensure \nsmooth project implementation: \n  \n(i)  Uttarakhand Transmission Strengthening and Distribution Improvement Project;  \n(ii)  Meghalaya Power Distribution Sector Improvement Project; \n(iii)  Tripura Generation Upgrading and Distribution Strengthening Project; and  \n(iv)  Other projects to be proposed by the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), Ministry of \nFinance for ADB Financing.4 \n \n4.  The projects to be supported by this TA are aligned with the operational priorities of ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030 (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequality by providing improved access \nto electricity and access to quality jobs, health and social services; (ii) tackling climate change, building \nclimate resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability; (iii) accelerating progress in gender \nequality by providing new opportunities using energy-based livelihoods; and (iv) promoting rural \ndevelopment and food security through enhanced power supplies to rural areas.5  \n \n5.  The TA facility modality is suitable as (i) it supports ensuing and/or ongoing projects in the \nenergy sector in low-income states in India with similar due diligence requirements; (ii) the TA will \nenhance project preparation efficiency and improve readiness of projects that have limited \nprocessing resources; (iii) the TA will promote sharing of experiences among different states \nworking with the same team of consultants; and (iv) strengthen coordination in project preparation. \nOverall, this TA facility will reduce transaction costs and time through minimizing the resources of \nstand-alone transaction TAs. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n6.  Output  1:  Network  planning  and  detailed  technical  assessment  supported.  \nTechnical experts will assist IAs in carrying out basic surveys to ascertain the condition of existing \nnetwork, network planning to optimize the network configuration, and identification of key areas \nthat require immediate attention. Based on the network planning, technical expertise will support \nIAs in preparing detailed technical specifications, engineering estimates, and cost-benefit analysis \nfor selected investment projects for potential ADB financing. IAs are expected to improve skills in \npreparing these documents through handholding and coaching support from technical experts. \n \n7.  Output 2: Procurement, financial and economic assessment supported. Technical \nexpertise will be provided to support IAs in preparing procurement risk assessment, financial \nmanagement assessment, financial analysis, and economic analysis necessary in preparing \nselected investment projects for potential ADB financing. IAs\u2019 capacity in these areas will be \ndeveloped through handholding and coaching interventions by technical experts. \n \n8.  Output 3: Environment and social safeguards due diligence completed. Technical \nexpertise to conduct due diligence on proposed projects\u2019  potential impact on environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, indigenous peoples, and other social dimensions will be provided to \nsupport project preparation. Activities will include: (i) preparation of safeguards documents on \nenvironmental,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples; (ii)  preparation  of climate \nadaptation measures; and (iii) gender and poverty analysis, collection of socioeconomic baseline \ndata, and preparation of gender action plans. \n                                                \n3  The ensuing projects (i), (ii) and (iii) are included in the country operations business plan for India, 2019\u20132022.  \n4  Projects that have attached technical assistance funds will not be supported by this TA \n5  ADB. 2018.

Technical \nexpertise and capacity building will be provided to selected IAs with ongoing or ensuing projects \nto strengthen the quality of safeguard implementation and monitoring. This will be carried out by \nsupporting additional surveys/studies, seminars, workshops and on-the-job training for IA staff \nacross multiple projects. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $1,100,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources).  The  key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. The TA facility scope is expected to be expanded to \ncover  other  additional  activities,  consistent  with  the  TA\u2019s  outputs  and  outcome,  and \nsupplementary funding may be requested as needed.  \n \n11.  The government agencies responsible for each project will provide counterpart support in \nthe form of counterpart staff, office space, office supplies, project related information and other \nin-kind contributions. The government was informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB \nto finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  The DEA, Ministry of Finance, Government of India will be the EA of the TA facility. \nGovernment department or agencies responsible for each project will be the IAs for the TA, \nsubject to the approval of DEA and ADB. After the initial approval of DEA, ADB will administer the \nTA facility and work directly with the state line agencies of the projects for all activities connected \nwith the TA, such as finalization of terms of reference and recruitment of consultants specific to \nthe project components and preparation of reports. \n \n13.  The TA facility will be implemented over a period of 30 months from September 2019 to     \nFebruary 2022. Disbursements under the TA facility will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n  \n14.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation  September 2019\u2013February 2022 \nperiod \nExecuting agency  Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance \nImplementing agencies  Implementing  agencies  are  the  agencies  that  are  preparing  or \nimplementing energy projects. For practical purposes, the TA will be \nadministered by ADB in close coordination with implementing agencies \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by IA and ADB \n  ICS (international)  (22 person-months)  $ 375,000 \n  ICS (national)  (48 person-months)  $ 300,000 \nDisbursement  The  TA  resources  will  be  disbursed  following  ADB's  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). \nAsset turnover or disposal  None \narrangement upon TA completion \nADB = Asian Development Bank, IA = implementing agency, ICS = individual consultant selection, TA = technical assistance.  \nSource:  Asian Development Bank.  \n ", "4   \n15.  Consulting services. The TA facility will provide an initial 70 person-months of consulting \nservices (22 person-months international and 48 person-months national)6 in the field of network \nplanning and technical analysis for energy sector projects, procurement, financial management, \nfinancial analysis, economic analysis, environment safeguards, social development (involuntary \nresettlement, indigenous peoples, gender, and poverty assessment). It is expected that the \nconsultants will be recruited using individual consultant selection method and deployed based on \nthe requirements of each project being prepared or implemented. ADB will engage the consultants \nfollowing the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated \nproject administration instructions and/or staff instructions. Individual consultant selection, rather \nthan through firm, is appropriate in this instance because the TA facility involves multiple activities \nthat are not necessarily interdependent and will require a varied range of consultants and services. \nHowever, where suitable, recruitment through a firm might be considered.  \n \nE.  Governance \n \n16.  Since ADB will administer the TA facility, the financial management, procurement capacity \nand integrity risks during TA facility implementation are assessed to be low. However, thorough \nrisk assessments for procurement, financial management and integrity for ensuing investment \nprojects will be conducted under the TA facility.  \n \nII.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nIndia for the Enhancing Capacity to Design and Implement Energy Sector Projects, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.  \n \n \n                                                \n6  TA facility savings may be utilized for additional consultant inputs, as may be necessary. \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($\u2019000) \nItem  Amount \nA.
