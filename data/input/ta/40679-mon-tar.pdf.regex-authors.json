INTRODUCTION \n1.  Mongolia  has  been  formulating  since  2006  a  comprehensive  National  Development \nStrategy (NDS)\u2015based on the millennium development goals (MDGs)\u2015which will lay down \nmajor development objectives and implementation strategies over the next 15 years in a broad \nrange  of  sectors  and  areas,  including  human  development,  environment,  and  a  public \ninvestment program. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) has taken the lead in developing  the NDS \nand will coordinate the sector strategies and priorities in implementing the NDS, which calls for \nharmonized investment planning and well-sequenced and monitored implementation. Managing \nfor development results (MfDR) is considered a useful tool to guide the planning, preparing, and \nmonitoring of investment plans in MOF\u2019s consultations with sector ministries.1  \n \n2.   During the Country Program Confirmation Mission for 2007, the Government of Mongolia \nrequested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  help  with  harmonizing  results-based \ninvestment planning. In response ADB and the Government agreed to expand the scope of an \nearlier planned technical assistance (TA) for institutional strengthening of MfDR,2 to mainstream \nthe MfDR approach in investment planning and public/social funds management.3 The proposed \nTA is included in ADB\u2019s nonlending program for Mongolia in 2007.4 The Fact-Finding Mission \nfielded  on  20\u201330  April  2007  reached  understanding  with  the  Government  on  the  impact, \noutcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of \nreference for the proposed TA. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.5\n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.       Since  the  Monterrey  Conference  on  Financing  for  Development  in  2002  and  the \nMarrakech Round Table on MfDR in 2004, MfDR has evolved into a major and widely adopted \nmanagement approach to improve planning, monitoring, and evaluating operations so as to \nachieve and sustain intended development results. As a means of conducting business, MfDR \nseeks to clarify objectives, monitor outputs and outcomes based on indicators, and make use of \nmonitoring information to improve learning and decision making. ADB\u2019s commitment to MfDR \nhas focused on three pillars, namely, results orientation at the level of developing member \ncountries (DMCs), at the institutional level in ADB, and through global partnership. \n \n4.  Mongolia was one of the first DMCs for which ADB formulated a results-based country \nstrategy and program.6 ADB has provided MfDR-related assistance to Mongolia under two \n                                                 \n1   The National Development Strategy (NDS) had been prepared and was presented in the technical working meeting \nbetween the Government of Mongolia and external partners in February 2007. An intense stakeholder consultation \nis ongoing, and the NDS is expected to be submitted to Parliament in autumn 2007 for approval. As the proposed \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  for  MfDR  (for  approval  at  end-July  2007)  aims  to  assist  with  results-based  and \nharmonized investment planning under the NDS, the implementation times for the TA and NDS match each other \nwell. \n2   ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program Update (2007\u20132009) for Mongolia. Manila (Sec.M78-06).  \n3   The scope of the initially planned TA mainly focused on developing MfDR systems and capacity building. Its \ndeepening and broadening include assistance to selected line ministries with the use of MfDR approaches in \nidentifying, formulating, implementing, and monitoring investment projects; provision of related advisory services \nand analytical support; and application of MfDR to social security funds and other public funds.  \n4   Memorandum of Understanding between ADB and the Government of Mongolia on the ADB Country Program \n2007 (signed on 20 December 2006). \n5  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 7 May 2007.  \n6   ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program (2006\u20132008) for Mongolia. Manila. Cf. also ADB. 2006. MfDR in ADB: \nRevised Action Plan. Manila. \n ", "2   \nregional  technical  assistance  (RETA)  projects. 7 The  RETAs  helped  Mongolia  improve \nunderstanding and results orientation of sector management processes for two sectors8 in a \ndecentralized context.  \n \n5.  One of the lessons learned from those RETAs was that processes for MfDR cannot be \nachieved overnight. While awareness of MfDR is increasing in Mongolia and its application has \nstarted through a sectorwide approach to help with the decentralization of education and health \nservices, the use of MfDR for investment planning and implementation is still fragmented due to \nlack of a systematic results framework, and related systems and procedures. The institutional \nand human capacity in this regard at MOF and other concerned line ministries and agencies \nneeds strengthening. However, there would be no single and overarching results framework that \ncould capture results chains and depict cause-and-effect relationships across all sectors and at \nall levels. Thus, special consideration and design features should be allowed for different line \nministries, taking into account their own characteristics and varied skills in public sector financial \nmanagement.    \n \n6.       In addition to investment planning and monitoring by sector ministries, the Government \nhas requested ADB\u2019s assistance to introduce MfDR for managing social security funds and \nother public funds including the Mongolian Development Fund, which has accumulated surplus \nfiscal revenues. The issue comes under the broad frame of public sector financial management, \nfor which ADB has been providing ongoing support to the Government, notably through two \nADF program loans (and an associated TA loan and advisory TAs) for the Governance Reform \nProgram (GRP I9 and GRP II10). GRP I helped establish a public sector financial management \nand accountability system through the adoption of the Public Sector Management and Finance \nLaw (PSMFL), while GRP II focused on improving the capacity of key public sector services to \ncarry out PSMFL-related measures and implement a wide range of reforms. The TA loan \nattached to GRP II is still ongoing, with focus on capacity building to support implementation of \npolicy measures under GRP II, including strengthening of public sector accounting and auditing, \nand introduction of new public management in line with the PSMFL. Therefore, introducing \nMfDR in public/social funds management and addressing the Government\u2019s emerging priority \non funds management will continue ADB\u2019s assistance in this sector. \n \n7.     Private  Sector  Operations  Department  (PSOD)  staff  joined  with  the  East  Asia \nDepartment (EARD) to field the Reconnaissance Mission from 9 to 13 February 2007 to explore \nways of providing assistance to Mongolia on public/social funds management. This initiative has \nbeen subsequently processed as a component of the proposed TA, given its focus on MfDR, \nand will be implemented by PSOD in concert with EARD.  \n \n \n                                                 \n7   ADB. 2003.

The  impact  of  the  proposed  TA  will  be  results-based  and  harmonized  investment \nplanning under the NDS and management of public/social funds by the Government. The \nimpact will be achieved by strengthening the institutional and human capacity of MOF and \nconcerned  line  ministries  for  applying  MfDR,  mainstreaming  results-based  processes  and \napproaches  in  preparing  and  managing  investment  projects  and  in  managing  public/social \nfunds, and aligning public/social funds management with best international practice on assets \nand liabilities management (ALM). \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  While  helping  mainstream  MfDR  in  investment  planning  and  management  of \npublic/social funds, the proposed TA will also ensure it will itself be results-oriented. To this end, \nthe TA will focus on areas where ADB is well-placed as an international financial institution to \nprovide specific value added (i.e., on investment planning under the NDS) or where ADB may \ncontinue its previous assistance so as to build on experience in the same sector (i.e., public \nfunds management). Effective coordination will be ensured with other aid agencies and ADB\u2019s \nongoing initiatives in Mongolia, to avoid overlapping and to pursue complementarity and mutual \nreinforcing of related programs. The design and formulation of a comprehensive MfDR system \nwill be based on analytical support and assessment of current regulations, procedures, systems, \nand practice in relation to MfDR. Sector context and characteristics of different line ministries \nwill be taken into account. MfDR will be pilot-tested by applying it first to selected line ministries.  \n10.  The proposed TA will also be guided by the general thrusts and methodologies as \nadvocated by ADB\u2019s revised action plan for MfDR,11 including (i) focusing on selected and \nachievable outcomes; (ii) using the country partnership strategy (CPS) as the primary entry \npoint for MfDR capacity development;12 (iii) integrating MfDR innovations with operations; (iv) \ninstitutionalizing  good  practices  to  contribute  to  a  results-oriented  culture  through  the \nprogressive introduction of guidelines, systems, and tools; and (v) supporting the community of \npractice (CoP) for MfDR.13\n \n11.  The proposed TA will have five interrelated components. \n \n(i)  Mainstreaming  at  MOF  the  MfDR  approach  in  investment  planning  and \nmonitoring  under  the  NDS.  This  component  will  comprise  (a)  systematic \nassessment  of  the  current  results  management  capacity  of  MOF,  focusing  on \nlinkages  between  plans,  budgets,  and  action;  institutional  structure;  clarity  of \nobjectives and performance standards; feedback to decision-making mechanisms; \nperformance accountability systems; and commitment, leadership, and ownership to \n                                                 \n11  ADB. 2006. MfDR in ADB: Revised Action Plan. Manila (IN241-06). \n12  The CPS results framework for Mongolia will have at the country outcome level exactly the same indicators as the \nnational indicators. The systems that the TA put in place to monitor the NDS will also directly feed back into the \nmonitoring of the CPS. Also, sector road maps will be derived from the results-based sector strategies that the TA \nwill help design. \n13 International experience would also be helpful in the design of MfDR systems. For instance, the Organization \nPerformance Indicator Framework (OPIF) used by the Government of the Philippines could be a useful reference. \nADB helped develop the operating manual for implementing OPIF under RETA6096. Cf. ADB. 2003. Technical \nAssistance for Supporting the Sector Approach and Results-Based Management in ADB Operations. Manila (R49-\n03).  \n ", "4   \napply MfDR approaches; (b) design of a comprehensive results management system \nfor public investment planning and monitoring, including main directions and guiding \nprinciples for MfDR-based investment planning; major results-based approaches to \nplanning, budgeting, and implementation; a set of realistic and measurable indicators \nfor monitoring and evaluation of public investment planning; systems to monitor \nthese indicators; processes for feedback and use of the monitoring information for \nlearning and decision making; and related enhancement or adjustment of institutional \nsetup  as  appropriate;  and  (c)  development  of  a  change  management  and \nimplementation plan for application of the MfDR system, and a mechanism for further \nrefining the various elements of the system. \n \n(ii)  Assistance to selected line ministries with the use of MfDR approaches. As \ndifferent line ministries have their own sector characteristics and context as well as \nvaried skills and capacity, the proposed TA will assist selected sector ministries with \nthe design and application of a tailor-made MfDR system along the lines of MOF\u2019s \nMfDR framework, to identify, formulate, implement, and monitor investment projects. \nThis will be conducted first on a pilot basis, focusing on priority sectors for ADB\u2019s \ninterventions and taking into account evolving needs of the Government under the \nNDS.14 As with MOF, past and ongoing initiatives will be examined in relation to \nresults management, capacity and readiness assessments, as well as planning for \nchange management. The pilot test will be closely monitored to fully understand the \nchallenges of applying MfDR in line ministries, and the lessons learned will be used \nfor expansion to other line ministries. \n \n(iii)  Provision of related advisory services and analytical support. The proposed TA \nis expected to provide advisory services15 and undertake assessments and analytical \nstudies as appropriate, which will guide investment planning, fill knowledge gaps in \nproject  identification  and  design,  explore  innovative  investment  approaches,  and \nupdate information and analysis required for aligning public investment planning to \nMfDR  objectives.  The  advisory  services  and  analytical  support  will  also  help \nharmonize the investments of government agencies and external partners in support \nof the NDS, and coordinate other results-related initiatives on national and sector \nlevels.  \n \n(iv)  Capacity  development  for  MOF  and  selected  line  ministries  to  use  MfDR \napproaches in investment planning and monitoring. This component will include \n(a) developing MfDR manuals and guidelines in both the English and Mongolian \nlanguages, which will be published and disseminated in the country; (b) training \ngovernment officials on the concept of MfDR approaches, related project appraisal \nand management techniques, and application of the designed MfDR system; (c) \nconducting MfDR workshops with government officials and concerned stakeholders; \nand  (d)  supporting  the  establishment  of  a  CoP  for  MfDR  in  Mongolia  and \n                                                 \n14 Ministries will be identified on the basis of three main criteria: (i) presence of ongoing ADB-financed investment \nprojects, (ii) level of ownership of the ministries for the MfDR approach, and (iii) the degree to which MfDR \napproaches are likely to be effective in the specific sectors. In light of the above criteria, the initial assessment is \nthat education, health, transport, and natural resources management are likely to be the primary sectors receiving \nassistance. Other ministries could be identified after further discussion and development. \n15 The advice will be provided using the working groups established by the Government as the primary platform. \nSpecifically, advisors will be appointed to the working groups in consultation with the Government, and the advisors \nwill draw up the specific areas in which advice is needed and at the same time suggest programs for related \ncapacity building so that advice is translated into long-term capacity development and is not just a one-time input. \n \n ", "  5\nstrengthening  its  operations.  The  proposed  TA  will  also  design  and  implement \ncapacity-building initiatives to improve project preparation and monitoring, sector \nanalysis,  strategic  planning,  and  other  capacity  within  MOF  and  concerned  line \nministries in relation to public investment planning and monitoring under the NDS, \nand to advisory services and analytical support provided in component (iii). \n \n(v)  Use of MfDR approaches in managing social security funds and other public \nfunds.  This  component  will  comprise  (a)  assisting  the  Government  with  funds \nmanagement by establishing a results-based optimal portfolio management strategy \n(including how these funds are managed, i.e., in-house, outside contracting, or a \ncombination of the two); strengthening capacities of staff; assessing the need for and \nhelping operationalize computer systems to manage the funds; and designing an \neffective internal control and monitoring system; and (b) conducting an assessment \nof the capital markets with focus on the constraints on entry and adequate operations \nof  public/social  funds  in  the  capital  markets,  and  giving  concrete  proposals  to \naddress these constraints, particularly through development of a long-term bonds \nmarket. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The cost of the proposed TA is estimated at $2.12 million equivalent. The proposed TA \nwill be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of \nJapan, in an amount equivalent to $1.5 million and by ADB\u2019s TA funding program in the amount \nof $300,000. The Government will provide $320,000 equivalent to finance the local currency \ncost to cover counterpart staff, office facilities, administrative support, facilitation for meetings, \nand other expenses. The detailed cost estimates and a financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The proposed TA will be implemented over 24 months, from August 2007 to July 2009. \nMOF will be the Executing Agency and will be responsible for preparing the NDS,  coordinating \nthe NDS working groups, and harmonizing the funding agencies. In this capacity, MOF  will be \nthe direct government counterpart for the proposed TA and will be primarily responsible for the \nharmonization activities. MOF will assign a Vice-Minister or State Secretary as project director, \nwho  will  coordinate  overall  implementation  of  the  proposed  TA  within  MOF  and  with  line \nministries. A department in MOF will be designated to assist the project director with day-to-day \nproject implementation, and with coordination with ADB and other aid agencies, as well as \noversight of the international and national consultants to be hired. The line ministries selected \nwill each become the Implementing Agency (IA) for the specific subcomponent.16\n \n14.  On ADB\u2019s side, the Mongolia Resident Mission will take charge of TA administration. \nPSOD  will  take  the  lead  for  funds  management\u2013related  assistance  (para.  11  [v]).  The \nsectors/ministries  for  which  MfDR  capacity  development  and  advisory  services  are  to  be \nprovided will be decided during project implementation, following sector priorities set forth in \nMedium-Term Strategy II, 2006\u20132008 (MTS II) and Mongolia\u2019s country strategy and program \n(CSP)/CSP update (CSPU), and in consultation with the concerned government agencies and \nEARD sector divisions as appropriate (please see major criteria in footnote 14). \n                                                 \n16 A subcomponent consists of a group of key activities in a given sector or area under components (ii), (iii), (iv),   \nand/or (v). Assignment of subcomponents to any IA for implementation needs to be mutually agreed upon by MOF \nand ADB.  \n ", "6   \n \n15.  The proposed TA will require 36 person-months of international and 94 person-months \nof national consulting services. The international consultants (person-months are in parentheses) \nwill be a results-based investment planning and monitoring specialist (6), sector specialists (total \nof 24), and a funds management specialist (6). National consultants with background in the \nabove areas will support the international consultants in planned activities under the proposed \nTA. Since consulting services will cover a broad range of areas and sectors,17 some of which \nare to be determined during project implementation, and considering that most assignments will \nbe small and on intermittent basis,18 hiring individual consultants is considered appropriate. The \nconsultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  equipment  budgeted  under  the  proposed  TA \nconsists of a strictly limited number of computers and capacity building-related equipment19 that \nwill be procured by ADB in accordance with its Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). The equipment will be transferred to MOF upon completion of the TA. The \nconsultants will work under the supervision of ADB in close coordination with the Government. \nThe outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n16.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $1,800,000 on a grant basis to the Government of Mongolia for  \nMainstreaming Managing for Development Results in Investment Planning and Public Funds \nManagement.  \n \n                                                 \n17 Including (i) results-based investment planning and monitoring; (ii) analysis, assessment, and other analytical work \nfor investment in various sectors; (iii) funds management/capital market; and (iv) project coordination and training.  \n18 Except that the project coordinator, who is a national consultant, will be retained during the whole project \nimplementation period.
