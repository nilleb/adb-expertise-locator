THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  The Proposal  \n1.  The proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) facility will support Southeast Asian \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) enhance gender \nequality results through technical support, policy advice, knowledge sharing, and capacity building. \nIt will improve gender mainstreaming at entry for new projects and support implementation of \nongoing gender mainstreamed projects across various sectors during the period 2019\u20132021. The \nregional TA facility will provide continued resources to sustain the achievements made under the \nfirst  regional  TA  on  Enhancing  Gender  Equality  Results  in  Southeast  Asian  DMCs,  while \nexpanding to also include project preparation support.1  \n \n2.  Constraints and Opportunities \n2.  Fostering equitable growth. Economic integration in Southeast Asia has significantly \nreduced extreme poverty from 17% of the region\u2019s population in 2005 to 7% in 2013.2 However, \nDMCs continue to face challenges in realizing equitable growth and ensuring women equally \nparticipate in and share the benefits of economic development.3 Women make up a large \nproportion of Southeast Asians still living below the poverty line\u2014an estimated total of 36 million \npeople. Compared with men, women in the region have less access to social safety nets and \nrestricted coverage from social insurance, social assistance, and labor market programs. 4  \n \n3.  Costs  of  gender  inequality  and  remaining  gender  gaps.  Women  have  a \ndisproportionate ability to fully capture economic benefits due to a number of factors including \ntheir limited technical skills, ownership rights, voice, access to credit, and time flexibility. Gender \ndisparities in labor force participation rates exist across all Southeast Asian countries, ranging \nfrom the smallest (approximately 3 percentage points) in Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao \nPDR)  to  the  largest  (33  percentage  points)  in  Indonesia.5 Women  are  overrepresented  in \n\u201cvulnerable employment\u201d among the categories of \u201cunpaid workers\u201d and \u201ccontributing family \nworkers\u201d, and in the informal sector, which increases prevailing vulnerabilities to external shocks.6 \nIn  Southeast  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  22%  of  women  workers  are  found  in  the  category  of \n\u2018contributing family workers\u2019 compared to 8% of men workers in 2018.7 Women in the labor market \nare generally concentrated in certain \u2018feminized\u2019 sectors characterized by low wages and insecure \nworking conditions. In addition to limited access to financial services and other barriers, the \ndisproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work carried out by women continue to hinder \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2015.

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries can \nreap as much as $1.2 trillion of gross domestic product, adding up to 30% growth in 2025 in a \n\u201cfull-potential scenario\u201d, wherein women participate equally in the workforce.9 \n \n4.  Recognizing, reducing, and redistributing women\u2019s unpaid care and domestic work is one \nof the areas that call for increased attention. Enhancing access to basic infrastructure services \n(water supply and sanitation, safe and affordable transport and energy) continues to play an \nimportant role in reducing women\u2019s \u2018time poverty,\u2019 and enhancing their mobility and participation \nin the labor market. Other areas that call for increased attention to advance gender equality \ninclude (i) ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health and rights including \nsexuality education, especially for women and the youth; and (ii) eliminating violence against \nwomen and girls, including sexual harassment at work, in schools, public transport, and public \nspaces. The adolescent birth rate has increased in Southeast Asia. For example, in Thailand it \nhas nearly doubled from 33 in 2000 to 60 in 2012 (per 1,000 adolescent women aged 15\u201319). \nThe HIV response in ASEAN has been particularly successful in reducing HIV prevalence among \nfemale commercial sex workers. Nevertheless, there are about 1.7 million people living with HIV \nin the region, of which close to a third are women. The proportion of women who experienced \nintimate partner physical and/or sexual violence in their lifetime is 34% in Viet Nam and 21% in \nCambodia.10 Trafficking of women and children is the highest in the region in spite of existing \nASEAN legal instruments in this area.11  \n \n5.  Engendering  inclusive  economies  and  realizing  sustainable  development. \nSoutheast Asian DMCs are committed to achieving gender equality and empowerment of all \nwomen and girls (dedicated Sustainable Development Goal [SDG] 5). SDG5 covers new but \ncrucial areas (not explicitly addressed in the Millennium Development Goals) such as unpaid care \nand domestic work, sexual and reproductive health and rights, harmful practices including child \nmarriage,  and  violence  against  women  and  girls.  Moreover,  the  Sustainable  Development \nDeclaration acknowledged the need to have gender systematically mainstreamed across the \nother SDGs. ASEAN leaders reaffirmed commitment to the gender-responsive implementation of \nthe ASEAN Community Vision 2025 and the SDGs, and the need for public investments to close \nresource gaps for achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls.12  \n \n6.  ADB supports the Southeast Asian DMCs in their efforts to achieving gender equality and \nrealizing sustainable development. In its Strategy 2030, accelerating progress in gender equality \n                                                 \n8  Unpaid care and domestic work cover jobs that are neither directly remunerated nor recognized as economic activity, \npredominantly done by women (e.g. child and elderly care, collection of firewood and water, cooking, and cleaning). \n9 \u201cFull-potential scenario\u201d represents the maximum economic impact that could be achieved from gender equality in \nlabor markets where current gaps in labor-force participation rates, hours worked and representation within each \nsector which affects productivity of women are addressed.

This regional TA facility is included in \ncountry operations business plan16 and is aligned with ADB Strategy 2030; it will work towards \nthe inclusion of women in poverty reduction efforts in Southeast Asian DMCs and ensure ADB \nprojects and public investments are equitable.  \n \n3.  Enhanced efforts needed to support gender mainstreaming  \n7.  ADB\u2019s  progress  in  gender  mainstreaming  has  been  facilitated  through  the  gender \ncategorization  system  and  the  use  of  project  gender  action  plans  (GAP)  as  a  gender \nmainstreaming tool. The Southeast Asian DMCs have been performing well in mainstreaming \ngender at entry: in the last three years, between 53 to 57% of committed operations were \ncategorized gender equity (GEN) or effective gender mainstreaming (EGM).17 GEN and EGM \ncategorization integrate gender-related performance targets and indicators in the project design \nand monitoring framework; a GAP is prepared and adequate resources human, funds and \nmaterials) are allocated for the implementation of the GAP. \n \n8.  The new opportunities offered by the SDGs and ASEAN 2025, and the new gender targets \nset in ADB Strategy 2030, will require additional technical support and resources to ensure quality \nof gender mainstreaming at entry and during project implementation. ADB has increased its \ncorporate target to 75% of its total committed operations promoting gender equality by 2030, \nwhich now also includes a sub-target for projects to be categorized as some gender elements \n(SGE). This will translate into an increase in resource requirements for gender mainstreaming at \nentry and ultimately for supporting DMCs in and overseeing the implementation of gender \nmeasures. With new areas covered under SDG5 and gender being mainstreamed across many \nother SDGs (including targets related to education, health, transport, and urban development), \nopportunities for integrating innovative gender designs during program and project preparation \nneed to be further explored. The integrated approach to solutions as envisioned in the SDGs and \nby ADB Strategy 2030 provides an excellent opportunity for further mainstreaming gender across \nsectors and themes. Nevertheless, as this is a new way of providing support to DMCs, it will \nrequire enhanced consultation with our clients and closer coordination to identify and incorporate \nrelevant gender responsive strategies and interventions in the DMCs.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2018.

Manila \n14 The target of 75% is for both sovereign and non-sovereign operations and likely to be broken down as follows: 10% \nof committed operations categorized as GEN, 45% EGM, and 20% SGE. \n15 ADB\u2019s corporate target of 70% of completed sovereign operations delivering the intended gender equality results has \nbeen overachieved since 2015. A similar gender target for completed projects -most probably higher- will be included \nin the new Corporate Results Framework for ADB Strategy 2030. \n16 More particularly, the transaction TA facility is included in the country operations business plans 2019\u20132021 for \nCambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and the Philippines.  \n17 The achievements are reported on a 3-year average basis. \n ", "4   \nFigure 1: Mapping to the ADB Strategy 2030 and the SDGs \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, DMC = developing member country, SDGs = sustainable development \ngoals. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n9.  The first phase TA (footnote 1) has been useful in strengthening GAP implementation, \nmonitoring and reporting of GEN and EGM projects, and thereby achieving the intended gender \nequality results. Key achievements under the TA so far include (i) 16 out of 18 (89%) project \ncompletion reports of GEN and EGM projects (reporting years 2016 and 2017) were rated \nsuccessful for having delivered the intended gender equality results, thereby exceeding the 70% \ncorresponding corporate target; (ii) 24 out of 26 (92%) of GEN and EGM projects have reported \non GAP implementation at mid-term review (conducted in 2016 and 2017), also exceeding the \ncorresponding target of 80% in the Gender Operational Plan; and (iii) GAP implementation of 75% \nof GEN and EGM ongoing projects (with effectivity of 2 years or more) is assessed as being on \ntrack in August 2018, an increase from 30% of such projects considered on track in September \n2016. The first phase TA helped build capacity of the DMCs in gender mainstreaming (i.e. gender \ntraining,  technical  support  to  project  management  units  and  executing  agencies  on  GAP \nimplementation, monitoring and reporting), generated gender-related research (Technical and \nVocational Education and Training [TVET] in Vietnam and women\u2019s time poverty and unpaid care \nwork in Lao PDR), and gender equality results at project completion (i.e. ensure that project \ncompletion reports documented qualitative and quantitative data). It is essential to sustain and \nfurther build on these achievements, to continue strengthening DMCs\u2019 capacity in gender. In \naddition, this new TA will support gender-related research on emerging sectors such as livable \ncities  or  impacts  of  disruptive  technologies  on  gender  equality  in  the  world  of  work, \neducation/technical and vocational education and training, and health. Updated country gender \nassessments for Indonesia or Viet Nam will be undertaken. The conduct of a lateral learning event \namong DMCs for exchanging knowledge and exploring innovative gender designs is envisioned. \n \n ", "5 \nB.  Outputs and Activities  \n \n10.  The TA will help Southeast Asian DMCs enhance gender equality results by supporting \nthe following two outputs.  \n \n11.  Output 1: Quality of gender mainstreaming at entry is enhanced. While the first phase \nTA focused on GAP implementation, the second phase TA will build capacity and support \nexecuting agencies to carry out gender analysis and mainstreaming during the project preparatory \nand design process\u2014a crucial starting point for effective GAP implementation. This output aims \nto (i) enhance the quality of gender analysis as part of due diligence; (ii) develop project GAPs \nthat are well informed by quality gender analysis, including sex-disaggregated baseline data, and \nthat build on DMCs\u2019 own gender strategies and action plans; and (iii) identify and integrate \ninnovative gender designs, which address some of the new areas covered by SDG5. Strategic \ntechnical inputs will be provided to support the quality of gender mainstreaming in new projects.18 \nThis output will also support country gender assessments or gender-related analysis on emerging \nsectors, and one lateral learning event among DMCs for exchanging knowledge and exploring \ninnovative gender designs.19 These knowledge products and event will identify strategies and \nconcrete  actions  to  support  gender  equality  objectives  that  can  feed  directly  into  country \npartnership strategies and future operations. The target audience of the knowledge products and \nevent are mainly executing and implementing agencies and National Gender Machineries in \nSoutheast Asian DMCs. International gender expertise will be hired under this output. \n \n12.  Output 2: Gender measures in gender mainstreamed projects are successfully \nimplemented. This output aims at sustaining achievements and continuing to strengthen DMCs\u2019 \ncapacity in gender. National gender consultants will be recruited and based in the resident \nmissions to provide regular support to  ADB clients and follow-up on GAP implementation, \nmonitoring and reporting. The consultants will also enhance the gender capacity of executing and \nimplementing agencies, gender focal points, and National Gender Machineries through coaching \nand in-country gender briefing sessions and trainings. One national TA coordination gender \nconsultant will be recruited to coordinate TA activities and provide technical support in the GAP \nimplementation. The TA facility will support the production of case studies and conduct of one \nregional workshop for knowledge sharing and capacity development on good practices in gender \nmainstreaming and achievement of gender equality results. The target participants for the regional \nworkshop will be executing and implementing agencies, gender focal points, and National Gender \nMachineries in Southeast Asian DMCs. International gender expertise will be hired for the \nknowledge products and event. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $1.5 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund ($1 million from TASF-6 and $500,000 from TASF-\nothers). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. The scope of the TA facility is \nexpected to expand to cover additional activities, consistent with the TA facility\u2019s outputs and \noutcome and be replenished from time to time as funds are required and identified, including \nthose from cofinancing sources and ADB-administered trust funds. \n                                                 \n18  Southeast Asia Department (SERD)\u2019s future portfolio of gender mainstreamed projects 2019\u20132021 (Appendix 3). \n19  For example, gender and livable cities or impacts of disruptive technologies on gender equality in the world of work, \neducation/technical and vocational education and training, and health.
