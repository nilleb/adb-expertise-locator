The Asian Development Bank (ADB) fielded a Fact-Finding Mission in May 2004 upon \nrequest of the Government of Indonesia for technical assistance (TA)1 in preparing the proposed \nWater Supply and Sanitation Project (WSSP). The WSSP will assist the Government in its \ncontinued  effort  to improve  water  supply  and  sanitation services  for  the  urban  population, \nparticularly benefiting the urban poor, and to achieve the related Millennium Development Goal \n(MDG).2 The objectives, scope, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, \nand terms of reference for the TA are based on the understanding reached with the Government \nduring the Mission. The project framework is in Appendix 1.  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Indonesia is urbanizing rapidly. The urban population had grown at about 4% annually \nduring the last decade, compared with the average annual national growth of about 1.7%. \nIndonesia\u2019s  urban  population  is  projected  to  increase  from  the  current  45%  of  the  total \npopulation to 60% by 2025, and is expected to double in absolute terms to reach 160 million by \nthen.  Most  urban  public  enterprises,  which  are  tasked  to  provide  basic  services  to  urban \ndwellers, are in crisis, notably local water utilities. In many parts of Indonesia, scarce water \nresources must be allocated for both urban use and the predominant agricultural use in rural \nareas, with availability of water becoming a serious issue for many cities. The quality of these \nwater resources is increasingly threatened by municipal and industrial wastewater, and the \nvarious forms of development in upper catchment areas affect both natural water retention and \nflash flooding.  \n3.  The introduction of regional autonomy in Indonesia on 1 January 2001 has resulted in \nthe devolution of substantial authority from the central Government to regional governments \n(RGs) at district and city levels (kabupaten and kota) for all aspects of local infrastructure and \nservice  delivery,  including  planning,  providing,  financing,  and  managing  water  supply  and \nsanitation. However, many of the more than 300 water utilities (PDAMs) throughout Indonesia \nare barely able to provide minimum services to consumers and have connected only about 39% \nof the urban population to piped water supply. The large number of PDAMs is a concern, \nbecause many are too small to be ever sustainable. \n4.  The lack of sanitation services requires urgent attention that will entail rehabilitating and \nextending  wastewater  collection  and  treatment  systems,  and  priority  drainage  leading  to \nimproved  urban  environments,  especially  in  low-income  areas.  The  high  incidence  of \nwaterborne diseases, particularly typhoid, is a potent indicator of the problems in the sector. \nSewerage serves less than 3% of the total urban population, and accumulation of grey water \nand other pollutants in low-lying urban areas results in severe environmental problems and \ndeteriorated living conditions for many of the urban poor. The initial poverty and social analysis \nis in Appendix 2. \n5.  To improve service delivery in urban areas particularly benefiting the urban poor, ADB is \nproposing the WSSP to be approved in 2005. The TA will build on previous work carried out to \ndevelop the sector, and review and update previous subproject appraisal reports (SPARs).3 The \nExecuting Agency, together with ADB, has disseminated information on the requirements for \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 5 May 2004. \n2  Goal 7 - Ensure Environmental Sustainability, Target 10 - Halve, by 2015, the portion of people without sustainable \naccess to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. \n3  ADB. 1998.

Manila. \n ", " 2  \nparticipation in the WSSP, highlighting the use of the onlending modality for passing on loan \nproceeds to RGs, need for cost recovery tariffs, restructuring of nonperforming loans, and \ncounterpart fund requirements.  \n6.  Besides  preparing  an  investment  project  for  urban  water  supply  and  sanitation \ninfrastructure, the TA will address major sector reform issues, including technical, managerial, \noperational, financial, and institutional deficiencies, which hamper improved service delivery of \nwater utilities. Widespread lack of cost recovery tariffs, compounded by a low level of revenue \ncollection, results in reduced maintenance and investment capacity, deteriorating assets, and \nlow service coverage and quality, all of which have a major impact on economic development, \nhealth, and well-being of the urban population. In addition, most of the PDAMs are heavily \nindebted. Some 220 PDAMs hold more than 400 outstanding loans with the Ministry of Finance \n(MOF), with many of the loans in arrears.  \n7.  Given the low level of only about 39% of the urban population connected to piped water \nsupply and the fast pace of urbanization, it will take major efforts to achieve the MDG for water \nsupply and sanitation (footnote 2). The bulk of finance for the urgently needed improvements \nwill  have  to  come  from  cash  generated  by  the  PDAMs,  and  from  improved  financial \nmanagement and borrowing capacity of RGs. Enhanced self-financing capacity of PDAMs is \nclosely related to improved governance in terms of corporatization and increased managerial \nautonomy. Measures to improve PDAM efficiency and financial and operational performance \ninclude cost recovery tariffs, improved revenue collection, enhanced financial management and \naccounting, nonrevenue water (NRW)4 reduction, expanded coverage with service connections, \nand stronger customer orientation. The TA will assess the financial status and fiscal capacity of \nparticipating  RGs,  and  will  identify  capacity  development  programs  for  enhancing  their \ncreditworthiness and to facilitate their future access to commercial funding sources, including \npotential bond financing. The TA will review the potential for private sector participation in the \nwater supply and sanitation sector, and recommend options for private sector involvement in the \nWSSP. \n8.  ADB has provided assistance for improving urban and rural water supply and sanitation \nin Indonesia since 1972: 8 water supply and sanitation loan projects for about $317 million, and \n15 TA projects for about $5.9 million. Additional financing for water supply and sanitation \nimprovement was provided through urban development projects. The World Bank has provided \nadditional support by financing water supply and sanitation and urban development projects, \nand is currently processing a loan for the Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Improvement and \nExpansion Project, which is similar to the proposed WSSP in objectives and scope. Other major \nsources  of  funding  for  the  sector  include  the  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment (USAID), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), Australian Agency for \nInternational  Development  (AusAID),  and  Germany  through  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische \nZusammenarbeit (GTZ) and Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW).  \n9.  The project design builds on lessons learned through the long-term involvement of ADB \nin the sector in Indonesia. Main lessons include (i) lack of operation and management capacity, \nparticularly in small PDAMs; (ii) tariffs that do not allow cost recovery, resulting in poor service \ndelivery;  (iii)  lack  of  public  participation;  (iv)  limited  support  for  financial  and  managerial \nautonomy  of  PDAMs  by  RGs;  and  (v)  small  contract  packages  that  result  in  inefficient \nprocurement and are difficult to monitor. \n                                                 \n4  NRW is composed of (i) physical losses caused by leakages; and (ii) commercial losses resulting from illegal \nconnections, meter under registration, and billing inefficiencies. ", "  3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The TA is designed to meet the growing demand of the urban population for improved \nwater supply and sanitation service delivery, in line with current Government policy and the \nrequirements  of  ADB.  Particular  attention  will  be  given  to  the  need  for  PDAM  reform, \ngovernance, improved water supply and sanitation, health, decentralization, legal requirements \nincluding  for  funds  channeling  (KMK  35),5  and  transparent  and  efficient  procurement  and \nimplementation arrangements. The Project will support the Government in its effort to achieve \nthe water related MDG (footnote 2).  \n11.  The objectives of the TA are to (i) develop the WSSP to a level of detail suitable for \nconsideration by ADB for funding, (ii) prepare SPARs for up to 15 PDAMs and RGs, and (iii) \nprepare institutional-development and capacity-building programs.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The  TA  will  require  a  proactive  and  demand-based  approach,  working  in  close \nconsultation with relevant parties at central and regional government levels, and will be carried \nout in two phases, which may partly overlap. \n13.  Phase 1. Phase 1 activities are to (i) gather and review sector relevant information, data, \nand reports; (ii) identify potential issues and hindrances that may affect successful and timely \nprocessing of the WSSP; (iii) develop criteria for selecting PDAMs and RGs; (iv) review and \nupdate data on PDAM and RG indebtedness and arrears in debt service;6 and (v) assist the \nGovernment, ADB, and other stakeholders in selecting suitable PDAMs and RGs, based on \ntheir  firm  commitment.  Activities  will  be  complemented  by  workshops  and  seminars  to \ndisseminate information, clarify issues, and ensure that all stakeholders, particularly PDAMs \nand RGs, are fully informed about the objectives, scope, and methodology of the Project, \nrequired counterpart contributions and other commitments, initial financing arrangements, and \nroles and responsibilities of all parties.  \n14.  Criteria for selecting PDAMs and RGs will be based on (i) their fiscal capacity and \ncommitment to reform, (ii) governance criteria, (iii) focus on serving low-income communities, \n(iv)  restructured  arrears  in  debt  service,  (v)  well-defined  investment  needs,  (vi)  project \npreparedness, and (vii) geographic focus of ADB. Performance and governance criteria are \nparticularly emphasized. To have efficient implementation arrangements for both the TA and the \nanticipated loan project, the WSSP will be confined to no more than five provinces. Phase 1 will \nbe completed within 2 months, and activities may partly overlap with those of phase 2. \n15.  Phase 2. Phase 2 will include (i) preparing SPARs for up to 15 PDAMS and RGs, (ii) \npackaging the WSSP to a level of detail suitable for consideration by ADB for funding, (iii) \ndeveloping  implementation  and  funds  channeling  arrangements,  (iv)  preparing  institutional-\ndevelopment and capacity-building programs, and (v) supporting workshops and seminars.  \n16.  The TA will be implemented following a bottom-up approach and a highly consultative \nprocess, enabling PDAMs, RGs and other stakeholders to take ownership of the SPARs and the \n                                                 \n5  Ministry of Finance Decree No. 35/2003 (KMK 35) defines fund channeling arrangements and cost-sharing \nrelationship between central and regional governments for foreign-assisted projects. \n6  The consultant will liaise with other consultants working on relevant technical assistance projects, including ADB. \n2002. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Support for Regional Government Borrowing System. \nManila. \n ", " 4  \noverall project. The TA will address issues, including but not limited to (i) pro-poor approach, (ii) \ngovernance, (iii) financial and operational utility performance improvement, (iv) cost recovery \ntariffs, (v) corporatization of PDAMs, (vi) improved sanitation, (vii) health and hygiene, (viii) \ngender,  (ix)  indigenous  peoples,  (x)  environment,  (xi)  resettlement,  (xii)  private  sector \nparticipation,  (xiii)  enhancement  of  municipal  creditworthiness,  and  (xiv)  transparent  and \nefficient implementation and procurement arrangements. The TA will be prepared in accordance \nwith relevant national standards and ADB requirements, policies, strategies, and guidelines.  \n17.  In designing water supply system improvements, the consultant will consider reducing \nnonrevenue water, extending the network to the urban poor, mobilizing idle system capacity, \nadopting measures to facilitate installation of house connections, enhancing cash flow, water \nbottling, water quality monitoring, improving energy efficiency, and developing water sources. \nSanitation will address wastewater collection and treatment, including but not limited to septic \ntanks, septage treatment plants, and relevant maintenance equipment. In addition, options for \nand feasibility of transferring responsibility for sanitation to PDAMs will be assessed during \nproject preparation. The consultant will develop capacity-building components, including but not \nlimited to programs for improving PDAMs\u2019 financial and operational performance and enhancing  \nRGs\u2019 creditworthiness.  \n18.  Implementation and procurement arrangements for the ensuing loan project will include \nmeasures  to  improve  efficiency  and  transparency,  and  to  reduce  the  risk  of  fraud  and \ncorruption. The TA will investigate an outsourced project management unit, independent audits \nof  financial  accounts  and  project  performance,  and  options  for  integrated  design-procure-\nconstruct contract packages.  \n19.  Current health and hygiene practices related to water supply and sanitation, and relevant \nawareness and education programs will be reviewed. The impact on health resulting from \nwaterborne diseases, and practices and standards for water quality monitoring will be assessed. \nCapacity building developed under the Project will include information programs that will explain \nand advocate the benefits and importance of clean water supply and sanitation for health, \nespecially for children and women. \n20.  Activities  under  phase  2  will  be  supported  by  workshops  and  seminars  aiming  at \ndisseminating  information,  confirming  commitment,  discussing  of  common  issues  of  PDAM \nreform, developing institutional capacity, and implementation support. Workshop participation of \nrepresentatives of successful water utilities from Indonesia and other countries of the region will \nbe  considered,  for  sharing  good  practices  on  improved  financial  and  operational  utility \nperformance, customer orientation, provision of services for the poor, and governance. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n21.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.125 million equivalent, comprising $462,000 in \nforeign exchange and $663,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested \nADB to finance $900,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign currency cost and $438,000 \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis, with \n$700,000 from the Government of the United Kingdom7 administered by ADB, and $200,000 \nfrom ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will finance the remaining local currency cost \namounting to $225,000 equivalent, which covers office and support facilities, counterpart staff, \nadministrative support, and local transportation for counterpart staff. The Government has been \ninformed that financing of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. Details \nof the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n                                                 \n7  Provided by the Department for International Development (DFID). ", "  5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be the Directorate General for Urban and Rural \nDevelopment (DGURD) of the Ministry of Settlement and Regional Infrastructure (MSRI). A \nproject management unit (PMU) to be established within DGURD will be responsible for the \ntechnical and administrative aspects of the TA, and day-to-day decisions affecting its conduct. \nThe PMU will include suitably qualified and experienced counterpart staff to work alongside the \nTA consultants. The TA consultants will provide support to the head of the PMU, and will work in \nclose collaboration with the counterpart team. A steering committee, chaired by DGURD and \ncomprising senior officials from DGURD, BAPPENAS, MOF, Ministry of Health, Coordinating \nMinistry for Economic Affairs, Ministry of Home Affairs, and Indonesia Water Supply Association \n(PERPAMSI) will be established to provide guidance and oversee TA implementation. The \ncommittee will meet monthly. \n23.  It is estimated that the TA will require a team of 4 international consultants and 15 \ndomestic consultants to be engaged by ADB for a total of 76 person-months: 18 international, \nand 58 domestic. The consultants will be engaged through a firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants, using the quality-and cost-based selection method and \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. DGURD will be \nresponsible for providing the agreed upon counterpart resources. The proposed outline terms of \nreference for the Consultants are in Appendix 4. All procurement under the TA will be in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Procurement. \n24.  The TA is expected to be implemented over 7 months, starting in January 2005 and with \ncompletion by August 2005. The consultants will prepare (i) an inception report within the first \nmonth, (ii) an interim report by the end of month 3, (iii) a draft final report by the end of month 5, \n(iv) a final report within 1 month after receiving comments, and (v) monthly progress reports. \nTripartite review meetings will be held after inception, at the interim report stage, and at the draft \nfinal report stage.  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom, and (ii) ADB providing the \nbalance not exceeding the equivalent of $200,000 on a grant basis, to the Government of \nIndonesia for preparing the Water Supply and Sanitation Project, and hereby reports this action \nto the Board.  \n ", " 6 Appendix 1 \nPRELIMINARY PROJECT FRAMEWORK   \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nGoal       \nImproved health and  Halve by 2015 the  Reports and statistics of \nquality of life of the  proportion of people  government agencies, \npopulation in line with  without access to safe  aid agencies, \nthe MDG target on safe  drinking water and basic  nongovernment \nwater supply and  sanitation (MDG 7, target  organizations, and \nsanitation  10)  participating PDAMs and \n  RGs \n \nPurpose       \nEnhanced quality of life  By 2011, in participating  MSRI and MOH reports  Sustained political \nand health of the urban  cities:  and statistics  commitment and fiscal \npopulation in selected  (i)  At least XX% of    capacity of PDAMs and RGs \ncities due to improved  households with  Reports of participating  to enhance the provision of \naccess to safe drinking  access to safe  PDAMs  water supply and sanitation \nwater and sanitation  drinking water    services \n  (ii)  At least XX% of  Reports of independent   \npoor urban  monitoring consultants \nhouseholds with   \naccess to safe  ADB review missions \ndrinking water and   \nbasic sanitation \nservices \n(iii)  Increase by XX% in \nnumber of new \nconnections for \nwater supply \n(iv)  Increase by XX% of \nnumber of \nhouseholds with 24 \nhours water supply \n(v)  Improved sanitation \nfacilities functioning \nin XX% of the target \narea \n(vi)  Achieved reduction \nby XX% in \nincidence of \nwaterborne \ndiseases \n \nOutputs       \nPhysical infrastructure  Enhanced service  Reports of participating  Political will and fiscal \nof water supply and  coverage as indicated by  PDAMs  capacity of city governments \nsanitation in selected  XX% increase in the    to borrow  \nRGs upgraded and  number of people  Reports of independent   \nexpanded  benefiting from improved  monitoring consultants  Continued support from \n  services     MSRI for sector reform as \nFinancial and    ADB review missions  defined by project objectives \nContinued on next page", "  Appendix 1  7 \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \noperational       \nperformance, and  PDAMs achieving  Quarterly progress  Issues regarding legal \ncustomer orientation of  financial and operational  reports  framework, particularly for \nPDAMs improved  performance targets as    funds channeling and fiscal \n  laid down in new    mapping related to MOF \nImproved city  business plans X years  KMK 35, resolved \ngovernment capacity to  after project completion   \nregulate and manage   \nthe provision of water  Water supply and \nsupply and sanitation  sanitation infrastructure \nbased on principles of  constructed and \ngood governance  operational as certified by \n  independent monitoring \n \nCompliance with ADB \nsocial safeguard and \ngovernance requirements \n       \nActivities/Inputs       \n(to be determined) \n \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, KMK 35 = Ministry of Finance Decree No. 35/2003, MDG = Millennium Development\nGoal, MOF = Ministry of Finance, MOH = Ministry of Health, MSRI = Ministry of Settlements and Regional Infrastructure,\nPDAM = Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum (Regional Government Water Supply Enterprise); RG = regional government. \n ", "8  Appendix 2 \nINITIAL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS (IPSA) \n \nA.

It is also predominantly the poor \nwho lack this access. Providing these facilities is hence an appropriate antipoverty measure.\u201d The poverty partnership \nagreement notes the importance of increasing basic services, including water supply and sanitation, to the poor. The \nrecently released Indonesia Progress Report on the Millennium Development Goals notes that urban population \ngrowth is rapidly outstripping access to piped water in urban areas. Sanitation is lagging further behind. To meet the \nMDG targets for clean water and sanitation in urban areas, considerable reform is required for financing investment, \ncreating  professionally  and  independently  managed  and  operated  regional  water  supply  enterprises  (PDAMs), \ncharging appropriate tariffs, developing incentives to connect the poor, and raising awareness and demand for \nsanitation. \n \nB.
