Two \nloans  are  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  ordinary \ncapital  resources  (OCR):  (i)  a  program  loan  of  $45  million  to \nsupport  fiscal  management  policy  reforms;  and  (ii)  a \nModernization of the Revenue Administration (MRA) project loan \nof  $15  million  mainly  for  procurement  of  the  Revenue \nAdministration  Management  Information  System  (RAMIS).  The \nthird loan of SDR 6,672,000 ($10 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources  is  a  project  loan  for  Institutional \nStrengthening of Fiscal Management Institutions through capacity \nbuilding, including implementation of the FMRP. \n   \nClassification  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n  Sector: Law, economic management, and public policy  \nSubsector: Public finance and expenditure management \nThemes: Sustainable economic growth; Governance \nSubthemes: Promoting macroeconomic stability; Financial and \neconomic governance \n   \nEnvironment  Category C \nAssessment \n   \nRationale  The  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  (the  Government)  is  facing \nincreasing fiscal stress from mounting and unsustainable fiscal \ndeficits and a concomitant large public debt. Without meaningful \nfiscal  consolidation,  unsustainable  current  expenditure  in \ncombination  with  an  impaired  revenue  administration  will \nincreasingly erode physical and social capital expenditures and \ncrowd out private investment, preventing Sri Lanka from reaching \na higher and sustainable path of economic growth. Under the \ncircumstances, addressing the country\u2019s weak public finances will \nbe  critical  in  order  for  the  country  to  successfully  fulfill  its \ndevelopment objectives, including its evolving poverty reduction \nstrategy. \n \nThe Government has responded to the serious fiscal challenges \nby  placing  fiscal  reform\u2014and  in  particular  revenue \naugmentation\u2014at  the  forefront  of  its  economic  policy  reform \nagenda. A three-pillar strategy has been adopted to strengthen \npublic  finances.  This  includes  a  revamped  fiscal  framework \nestablished under the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act, an \nenabling  policy  environment  based  on  the  overhaul  and \nstreamlining  of  taxation  policy,  as  well  as  institutional \nstrengthening  of  the  revenue  administration  supported  by  the \ncreation     of    a     modernized    revenue    administration .   The \n ", "ii \nFMRP supports the Government\u2019s strategy of fiscal consolidation \ncompatible with medium-term fiscal sustainability.  \n \n  The  thrust  of  the  FMRP  is  on  developing  and  implementing \nsystems  and  procedures  to  ensure  effective  and  sustainable \ncompliance with fiscal objectives. The ADB assistance is expected \nto be complemented by an International Monetary Fund (IMF) \nPoverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Facility  (PRGF)  and  Enhanced \nFund Facility (EFF), currently suspended, that is likely to include \ntaxation policy reform measures. The second tranche release of \nPRGF was originally due in December 2003. However, following \npolitical developments, including the dissolution of Parliament in \nFebruary 2004 and the general elections of April 2004, the new \nGovernment is firming up key macroeconomic policies and is in \ndiscussions  with  IMF  on  the  resumption  of  PRGF.  Looking \nforward, the PRGF is not likely to be renewed before early 2005 \nfollowing the Government\u2019s 2005 budget and supporting economic \npolicy framework action plans. \n   \nEstimated FMRP  December 2007 \nCompletion Date \n   \nProgram Loan    \n  Objectives  The  FMRP  supports  the  strengthening  of  public  finances  by \nimproving public resource and expenditure management systems, \npromoting fiscal discipline, and supporting fiscal decentralization. \n \nTo achieve these objectives, the FMRP will support: (i) improving \neffectiveness  of  tax  administration,  (ii) improving  the  budget \nframework,  (iii) improving  expenditure  management  and  control \nsystems,  (iv) strengthening  fiscal  discipline,  and  (v) improving \nfiscal coordination. \n \nMore  generally,  the  FMRP  will  help  create  an  enabling \nenvironment  to  foster  mobilization  of  tax  revenues,  improve \neffectiveness of public expenditures and, ultimately, place public \nfinances on a sustainable path. \n   \n  Financing Plan  ADB will provide a loan of $45 million equivalent from OCR. The \n  FMRP loan will have a 15-year term including a grace period of 3 \n  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the Program Loan Agreement. \n   \n  Period and Tranching  The FMRP loan period will be 3 years from December 2004 to \nDecember 2007. The loan will be released in three equal tranches \nof $15 million each. The first tranche will be released upon loan \neffectiveness. The second and third tranches are expected to be \nreleased  within 18  and  36  months, respectively, from release of ", "  iii\n \nthe  first  tranche,  subject  to  the  satisfactory  compliance  with \nsecond and third tranche release conditions, respectively. \n   \n  Executing Agency  The  Executing  Agency  (EA)  of  the  program  loan  will  be  the \nand Implementation  Ministry of Finance and Planning (MOFP). MOFP will set up an \nArrangements   interagency  implementation  and  coordination  committee  (IICC) \nheaded  by  the  secretary  to  the  treasury  and  comprising \nrepresentatives  from  the  Fiscal  Policy  Department,  National \nBudget  Department,  External  Resource  Department,  National \nPlanning  Department,  Public  Enterprises  Department,  State \nAccounts Department, Revenue Board, Central Bank of Sri Lanka, \nand Finance Commission. ADB will also be a member of the IICC. \nThe  IICC  will  meet  every  quarter  to  monitor,  coordinate,  and \nensure  the  effective  implementation  of  the  proposed  reforms \nunder the FMRP. \n   \n  Procurement  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign \nexchange costs of items produced and procured in ADB member \ncountries, excluding ineligible items and imports financed by other \nbilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  In  accordance  with  the \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures \nand Related Requirements for Program Loans, the proceeds of \nthe  FMRP  loan  will  be  disbursed  to  the  Government  as  the \nBorrower. The Government will certify that the volume of eligible \nimports exceeds the amount of ADB\u2019s projected disbursements \nunder the loan for the given period. It is expected that the loan \nproceeds will be utilized over a period of 36 months from the date \nof loan effectiveness. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of \nthe loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s \ncertification.  Loan  proceeds  may  be  used  to  finance  eligible \nimports for which expenditures were incurred 180 days before the \nFMRP loan becomes effective. \n   \nCounterpart Funds  Counterpart funds generated from the FMRP loan will be used to \nmeet FMRP expenditures and associated costs of reform. \n   \nProject Loan   \n  Objectives  The two project loans will support: (i) institutional strengthening \nfocusing on the procurement of equipment primarily for the RAMIS \nto ensure a prompt and smooth transformation of the revenue \nadministration;  and  (ii)  capacity  building  for  the  MRA,  MOFP \ndepartments, and other agencies to strengthen implementation of \nprocesses  and  procedures  outlined  in  the  FMRP  through  the \nengagement of consultancy services and training activities. \n   \n  Financing Plan  ADB will provide two project loans. The first project loan is in an \namount of $15 million from ADB\u2019s OCR with a term of 25 years, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  and  with  interest  to  be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based loan facility, a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such other terms \n ", "iv \nand conditions set forth in the Program Loan Agreement. The \nsecond project loan is in an amount of SDR 6,672,000 ($10 million \nequivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The loan will \nhave a 32-year term including a grace period of 8 years and an \ninterest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter, and follow such other conditions as \nset forth in the Program Loan Agreement. \n   \n  Executing Agency  MOFP will oversee and coordinate project loan implementation. \nand Implementation  Project implementation will be carried out by: (i) the IICC; and \nArrangements  (ii) a project implementation unit for the MRA project, headed by a \nproject manager (consultant) who will report jointly to the chief \nexecutive officer of the Revenue Board and to the secretary to the \ntreasury. \n \n  Procurement and  Procurement of goods and services will be in accordance with \nDisbursement  ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Expenditure procedures will \nbe  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook. \nConsultants to be financed from the project loans will be recruited \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for  recruitment  of \ndomestic  consultants.  A  total  of  160  person-months  of \ninternational  and  270  person-months  of  domestic  consulting \ninputs  will  be  required.  In  view  of  the  size  of  the  consulting \nservices  component,  a  management  coordination  team  will  be \nhired to be fully responsible for all administrative and managerial \naspects of the capacity-building activities under the Strengthening \nof  the  Fiscal  Management  Institution  Project.  In  view  of  the \nimportance of capacity-building to the success of FMRP, where \nfirms  are  to  be  engaged,  the  quality-based  selection  (QBS) \nmethod will be utilized for selection of consultants. Where possible \nand appropriate, simplified technical procedures will be applied.  \n \nFMRP Benefits and  The FMRP will help establish a well-functioning, coordinated, and \nBeneficiaries  semiautonomous  revenue  administration  that  is  expected  to \ncomprise inland revenue, customs, and excise departments, and \nthat would be responsible for all aspects of revenue collection. As \npart of the automation of the revenue administration, the FMRP \nwill contribute toward establishing e-government. The FMRP will \nalso  help  streamline  budgeting  procedures  and  expenditure \ncontrol processes within MOFP. \n \nAs part of the reform agenda, the FMRP will support measures to \nstrengthen fiscal discipline through increasing transparency and \naccountability, and will be based on legislative and rules-based \nreporting requirements. \n \nThe FMRP will support the reorientation of budget management \nfrom a compliance-based system to one incorporating elements of \nresults-based budgeting.  This should set the stage for addressing \n ", "  v\n \nconcerns of efficiency and effectiveness of public spending and \neventually improve service delivery. \n \nFinally, support for fiscal decentralization will comprise measures \nto reduce the overlap of public expenditure functions across levels \nof  government  and  other  reforms  to  improve  funding  and \neffectiveness of devolved assignments. \n \nNotwithstanding an increase in effective tax contribution, direct \nbeneficiaries will include business at large who despite paying \nhigher taxes on average (as loopholes are closed and effective \ntax compliance strengthened) over the medium term, will benefit \nfrom  clearer,  simplified,  and  more  business-oriented  tax  and \ncustoms  administrations.  In  addition,  those  segments  of  the \npopulation most dependent on the provision of public goods and \nservices\u2014particularly across subnational constituencies\u2014should \nexpect an eventual improvement of the quality of these services. \nThis would reflect FMRP measures supporting the curtailing of \nduplication of expenditures and other nonproductive use of public \nresources. Finally, the population at large should benefit from the \nreduction  of  domestic  imbalances;  higher,  sustainable,  GDP \ngrowth; and attendant development objectives. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  There are multiple risks to the successful implementation of the \nFMRP. Foremost, consolidation of the peace process and political \nstability will be critical for the Government to oversee meaningful \neconomic reforms. Fiscal consolidation efforts, in particular, will \nrequire strong government commitment and any slippages in the \nsecurity or political fronts may weaken the Government\u2019s resolve. \nAlthough limited disbursements were realized in 2004, resources \ncommitted under the June 2003 Tokyo Donor Conference, and \nsubject  to  progress  in  peace  talks,  should  facilitate  the  fiscal \nconsolidation process. \n \nOn the economic front, exogenous shocks to the economy could \nimpair  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to  undertake  aggressive  fiscal \nconsolidation as observed in 2004 following the oil price shock \nand the prolonged drought. However, over the medium term, fiscal \nconsolidation leads to improved macroeconomic stabilization and \ngreater flexibility to cope with these shocks, thereby creating a \nreinforcing link between the deepening of fiscal reforms and the \nability to cope with these shocks. In addition, the Government has \nundertaken  reform  measures  including  moves  toward  a  more \nflexible  exchange  rate  system  to  mitigate  the  impact  of  these \nshocks. \n \nOther  risks  include  the  power  of  vested  interests  that  could \nsupport the status quo and that may successfully mobilize public \nopinion (i.e., through strikes and other forms of industrial action) to \ndilute the reforms and possibly prove detrimental to the FMRP \nobjectives. There are also institutional risks given the relatively \n ", "vi \noverstretched  resources  in  key  ministries  and  the  revenue \nadministration. These, combined with the comprehensive nature \nof the FMRP and the close links with political risks, may slow \nimplementation of the FMRP.  \n \nSafeguards  include  the  \u201cadditionality\u201d  of  a  renewed  and \nconstructive policy dialogue between the Government and IMF on \nconducive  macroeconomic  policies  and  fiscal  consolidation \nfollowing  the  suspension  of  its  PRGF.  In  addition,  supporting \nproject  loans  under  FMRP  will  mitigate  institutional  risks  and \nothers  through  the  increased  supply  of  resources\u2014including \nconsulting services, equipment and training\u2014which should help \novercome  institutional  constraints,  build  capacity,  and  facilitate \nFMRP  implementation.  For  this  reason,  close  coordination \nbetween ADB and the Government is of fundamental importance \nespecially with respect to monitoring of FMRP and, in particular of \nconsultants\u2019 performance. ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on three proposed \nloans to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Fiscal Management Reform \nProgram (FMRP). Asian Development Bank (ADB) support would comprise: (i) an ordinary \ncapital resources (OCR)-funded program loan (policy component) for FMRP policy reforms; \n(ii) an OCR-funded project loan for Modernization of the Revenue Administration; and (iii) an \nAsian  Development  Fund  (ADF)-funded  project  loan  for  Strengthening  of  the  Fiscal \nManagement Institutions. \n \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n \n2.  Sri Lanka\u2019s economy continues on a strong recovery phase with gross domestic product \n(GDP) growing by 5.9% annually in 2003 compared with 4% in 2002 and a contraction of 1.5% \nin 2001. Growth was relatively broad based\u2014on the production side\u2014with the services sector \nrecording 7.7% growth (year on year) and accounting for a 55% share of the economy. The \nindustry sector recorded 5.5% growth and the agriculture sector 1.5% growth. More generally, \neconomic growth has remained robust supported by accommodative monetary policy and fiscal \nconsolidation (prior to the oil shock) leading to seven consecutive quarters of GDP growth in \nexcess of 5.5%, including 6.2% growth in 2004Q1 before slowing to 5.2% in 2004Q2. (See \nSupplementary Appendix 1 for economic indicators, 1999\u20132003.)  \n \n3.  On the aggregate demand side, the recovery has been driven by domestic demand and \nmainly reflects a combination of improved security conditions in the country and the impact of \nthe Government\u2019s macroeconomic policy reforms. Domestic consumption in real terms in 2003 \nremained strong, growing by 6.1% (year on year) in 2003 against 6.5% in 2002, reflecting the \neffects of pent-up household demand as the security situation improved and disposable income \nincreased. More significantly, investment growth accelerated to 17% in 2003 from 6.7% in 2002, \nas investor confidence picked up from the initial increase in consumer confidence, reflecting the \ncontinuation  of  the  cease-fire  agreement  and  cautious  optimism  on  the  outlook  for  peace \ncombined with the introduction of more market-friendly policies. In particular, lower lending rates \nand increased government investment, particularly in the North and East, have led to strong \nexpansion in power, roads, telecommunications, and building construction. The upsurge in \ninvestment continues apace with import of investment goods in 2004Q1 increasing by 56%. \nFinally, buoyed by a recovery of the world economy, exports of goods and nonfactor services \ngrew by 4.8% in 2003. \n \n4.  More importantly for long-term growth, the recovery reflected a strengthening of the \nmacroeconomic environment. In particular, fiscal consolidation\u2014the primary deficit improved to \n0.9% of GDP in 2003 from 1.6% in 2002 and 4.1% in 2001\u2014and exchange rate stabilization\u2014\nthe Sri Lanka rupee\u2019s real effective exchange rate depreciated by a moderate 2.8% in 2003\u2014\nled to a deceleration of inflationary pressures with inflation, as measured by the Colombo \nconsumer price index (CCPI), declining to 6.3% in 2003 from 9.6% in 2002. This led to a \nreduction in total resources raised in the domestic market,1 paving the way for a reduction of the \nprime lending rate to an average of 9.3% in 2003 from 13.2% in 2002 and 19.4% in 2001.  \n \n5.  On the external side, the overall balance of payments recorded a surplus of $502 million \nin 2003 (or 2.8% of GDP), the highest since 1993. This reflected a reduced current account \n                                                 \n1  The total amount of resources raised in the domestic market in 2003 decreased to 4.5% of GDP from 8% of GDP \nin 2002. ", "2 \ndeficit (0.6% of GDP) and an increased surplus in the capital and financial accounts. The \nreduced current account deficit was driven by a fast recovery in tourism, strong performance in \nthe ports subsector, and higher worker remittances. In 2003 both merchandise exports and \nimports grew by 9% (year on year) in dollar terms. Meanwhile capital flows into the country \nincreased in 2003 led by inflows of foreign direct investment of $229 million compared with \n$197 million in 2002, due to larger privatization proceeds of approximately $30 million in 2003. \nTotal  long-term  loan  capital  increased  to  $908 million  from  $542 million  in  2002,  largely \nattributed to improvements in development assistance utilization rates, which increased to 21% \nin 2003 from 15% in 2002. Consequently, in 2003 Sri Lanka\u2019s gross official external reserves \nincreased to $2.3 billion, equivalent to 4.2 months of import cover. During the first half of 2004, \nthe overall balance of payments pointed to a deterioration resulting in an estimated deficit of \n$223 million. This reflected a widening deficit of the trade and income accounts driven by higher \noil prices that could not be fully offset by lower inflows to the capital and financial accounts.2 As \nof August 2004, gross official external reserves stood at $1.9 billion, a decline of 17% since the \nend of 2003 and equivalent to 3.1 months of imports. \n \n6.  Over the medium term and subject to an early resumption of peace negotiations, the \neconomic outlook remains favorable despite a difficult short-term patch reflecting the impact of \nhigh oil prices on the economy. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has recently revised its \nannual GDP growth estimates for 2004 to 5.0\u20135.5%, slightly below the 6% growth target under \nits Monetary Program for 2004. CCPI average inflation is targeted at 4\u20136% in 2004, although \nthe latest CCPI figure for October 2004 at 11.6% (point-to-point), and reflecting the impact of \nhigh oil prices suggests that the annual CCPI inflation target may be breached. Money supply \n(M2) continues to grow at 16% in August 2004 in excess of the 13.5% projected in the Monetary \nProgram due to higher than expected increases in credit to the private sector and in net credit to \nthe government.  Accordingly, corrective policy measures need to be introduced over the short-\nto medium term including tightening fiscal and monetary policies to curtail potential imbalances.  \nThe Government has reacted to these imbalances and in its meeting of early November 2004, \nthe Monetary Board raised benchmark interest rates by 50 basis points. \n \n7.  However, the most critical challenge to sustained growth remains the current fiscal \nstance and, particularly, impaired revenue collection. Following efforts to stem the adverse \nimpacts of higher oil prices and a drought and coinciding with the two elections in 2004 (national \nand provincial) and delays in tightening revenue legislation, the target fiscal deficit has slipped \nfrom 6.8% of GDP in the 2004 budget to 7.3% in the Preelection Budgetary Position Report and \n8.6% of GDP in the Budget Economic and Fiscal Position Report 2005 of November 2004. The \nslippage on the fiscal front has already led to a weakening of the Sri Lanka rupee, which has \ndepreciated by approximately 8% against the dollar since the beginning of 2004 and 3-month \nSLRe/US dollar forward rates in November 2004 were pricing in a further depreciation of 1.7%. \nSimilarly, and despite evidence of financial repression, there has been upward pressure on \ninterest  rates,  reflecting  expectations  of  increased  government  demand  for  loanable  funds \nparticularly at longer-term maturities in the secondary market. \n \n8.  In response to the weakening of the fiscal stance, and following the provincial elections \nin July 2004, the Government has begun reducing the subsidies on oil prices. These subsidies \nhave cost the treasury approximately SLRs8 billion according to preliminary estimates, placing \nfurther pressure on the budget. In these circumstances, the Government is expected to tighten \nfiscal policy and introduce a higher degree of fiscal discipline over the coming months. Indeed, \n                                                 \n2  The Government is facing a shortfall of foreign funding on the balance of payments of approximately $300 million in \n2004 including the $150 million \u201ctemporary relief\u201d credit line from the Government of India. ", "  3\n \nthe Government has committed to a fiscal consolidation strategy, which will need to be closely \nadhered to if stable and sustainable GDP growth is to be maintained. More importantly, while \nthe fiscal targets under the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act are not expected to be \nachieved  by  targeted  date  of  end-2006,  the  Government  will  need  to  undertake  prompt \ncorrective action and publicly commit to avoiding any further slippages beyond the expected 2-\nyears delay announced in the 2005 Budget. \n \n9.  During the first nine months of 2004, tourism revenues remained buoyant as tourist \narrivals  increased  by  11%.  Similarly,  the  stock  market  continued  its  bull  run  as  market \ncapitalization at the Colombo stock exchange increased by 38% in Sri Lanka rupee terms during \nthe first 10 months of 2004. Similarly, in international trade, merchandise exports during the first \nnine months of 2004 increased by 9% while merchandise imports during this period soared by \n20.5%.  The acceleration of imports is mostly due to the hike in oil prices, which is expected to \nlead to expenditures on oil imports of $1.6 billion, almost double the import bill in 2003. In these \ncircumstances, the growing current account deficit is projected at approximately 4% of GDP, up \nfrom 0.6% in 2003.  \n  \n10.  More generally, the outlook will be largely dependent on the overall prevailing security \nconditions and, in general, progress in peace talks between the Government and the Liberation \nTigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). If progress is faster than expected, growth could be somewhat \nhigher, aided by the $4.5 billion in foreign assistance committed at the June 2003 Tokyo Donor \nConference for the period 2003\u20132006. The challenge in this scenario would be the need to \nincrease the Government\u2019s absorptive capacity\u2014including both at the national and subnational \nlevels. If there is a setback to peace talks, investor confidence could plummet, potentially \naffecting private capital flows and undermining growth prospects. Political stability, given the \nwide ideological spectrum of the parties forming the governing alliance, will also weigh heavily \non this front. \n \n11.  From a policy perspective, the outlook is subject to continued progress in strengthening \nthe macroeconomic framework. Two of the key issues undermining stable and sustainable \ngrowth include reducing the fiscal deficit and, closely related, lowering the public debt. The \nGovernment\u2019s ability to meet the development objectives established in its Economic Policy \nFramework will depend on success in strengthening the macroeconomic framework and, in \nparticular, addressing these economic imbalances. \n \n \nIII.  THE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Sector Description and Performance \n \n12.  Fiscal consolidation remains key to improving the macroeconomic performance in Sri \nLanka.  Over  the  years,  mounting  defense  spending  on  top  of  generous  social  sector \nexpenditure led to increasing pressure on the budget. Attempts to raise tax revenues failed \ngiven the narrow revenue base and weak tax administration. Debt financing proved a temporary \nreprieve.  Financial  liberalization  eroded  the  captive  pool  of  available  funds,  forcing  the \nGovernment to pay higher interest on its domestic debt. In addition, strains on the balance of \npayments led to exchange rate devaluations, raising the local currency value of the external \ndebt. Increasing budget deficits, in turn, led to a crowding out of needed physical and social \ncapital and private investment, weakening GDP growth. As a result, in 2002 the budget deficit, \nexcluding grants and privatization proceeds, reached 8.9% of GDP and public debt increased to \n106% of GDP. \n ", "4 \n13.  On the revenue side, the problem is traced fundamentally to the complex tax policy that \nprevailed  in  Sri  Lanka  in  combination  with  the  myriad  of  tax  exemptions.  These  inherent \ndistortions multiplied over the years due to government largesse and, in particular, industrial \npolicy objectives, which dominated tax revenue and other fiscal objectives. In addition, relatively \nweak revenue administration in the inland revenue, customs and excise departments, and \nBoard of Investment (BOI)\u2014reflecting a shortfall of skilled and adequately paid staff\u2014further \nconstrain effective revenue collection. Over the years, enforcement capabilities were further \nstrained and there was a general perception of prevalent corruption among many customs and \ntax officers. To make matters worse, governments were frequently granting tax amnesties, \ncreating leakage in the system and further undermining tax collection and enforcement efforts. \nFurther abetted by the elimination of taxes on international trade, tax yields declined by 4.6 \npercentage points from 17.8% of GDP in 1995 to 13.2% in 2003. \n \n14.  On the expenditure side, Sri Lanka is characterized by a framework that until recently \nwas rather lax in terms of both expenditure ceilings and controls and had a weak link between \nfiscal objectives and the budget framework. In addition, Sri Lanka\u2019s large and overstretched \npublic sector, including commercial public enterprises, was unable to meet spiraling costs and \ntended to subsist thanks to direct subsidies and/or subsidized lending by the state, placing \nadditional pressure on state accounts (and state banks). The internal conflict in Sri Lanka also \ncontributed to increased budgetary pressure as scarce resources were directed to financing \nrelatively  large  military  spending.  Finally,  there  has  been  a  pattern  of  politically  induced \nloosening of the fiscal policy stance in the run-up to elections, and once again witnessed in \n2004. Against this backdrop, current expenditures in 2003 were estimated at 19% of GDP, down \nfrom 20.9% in 2002. Public investment absorbed a significant part of the expenditure cutbacks, \nfalling to 4.6% of GDP in 2002, the lowest in a decade, before increasing to 5% in 2003. (See \nSupplementary Appendix 2 for a summary of government fiscal operations.) \n \n15.  As government revenues were unable to cover the increased spending requirements, \nthe deficits were increasingly financed through domestic borrowing. However, rising deficits \nplaced upward pressure on interest rates, increasing debt service payments. In parallel, the \nGovernment also borrowed overseas for the purchase of defense equipment, putting further \npressure on state revenues. In addition, external borrowing was contracted primarily in dollars, \nwhich combined with the depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee led to even higher debt-servicing \npayments.3 Finally, given the nature of the debt market, there was an overconcentration of \nshort-term debt that limited effective debt management. \n \n16.  In these conditions, public debt soared to 106% of GDP in 2002 from 87% in 1997\u201458% \npublic domestic debt and 48% public foreign debt. In 2002, and realizing the importance of fiscal \nconsolidation, the Government prepared a fiscal consolidation program in line with its fiscal \nsustainability strategy. As part of the strategy, the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act was \napproved in early 2003. The overall budget deficit target under the Act was set at 5% by the end \nof 2006. On the basis of a tightening of expenditures, and coinciding with significant interest rate \ndeclines reflecting an inflation stabilization-oriented monetary framework, the overall budget \ndeficit in 2003 was reduced to 8% of GDP. While above target, it nevertheless represented a \nsignificant improvement compared with the 8.9% recorded in 2002. The year 2003 also marked \nthe first time that the Government\u2019s outstanding debt stock was contained as a percentage of \nGDP. Total debt-servicing payments in 2003 increased to almost 20% of GDP comprising \n                                                 \n3  According to CBSL Annual Report 2002, the cumulative increase in the foreign debt stock due to exchange rate \ndepreciation during 1996\u20132002\u2014amounting to SLRs251 billion\u2014was about 35% of the total outstanding foreign \ndebt stock at the end of 2002, equivalent to 15.8% of GDP in 2002.  ", "  5\n \nalmost 12.5% in amortization and over 7% in interest payments, the latter almost entirely in \ndomestic debt. More critically, higher debt servicing places undue pressure on capital spending. \nIn 2003, interest payments accounted for over one third of current expenditures and exceeded \ncapital spending by a ratio of 1.4:1. To make matters worse, due to a spike in debt amortization \npayments, debt service payments exceeded total revenue collection in both 2002 and 2003. \n(See Supplementary Appendix 3 for Sri Lankan key debt indicators.) \n \n17.  On the fiscal front, the first half of 2004 resulted in a mixed picture. On the expenditure \nside,  performance  was  disappointing.  The  impact  of  relief  assistance  to  drought-stricken \nhouseholds and subsidies to cushion the effect of higher international oil prices against the \nbackdrop of national and provincial elections explain the setback. Despite the oil subsidies not \nbeing  fully  reflected  on  the  budget,  current  expenditure  for  2004  has  been  revised  to  a \nprovisional figure of SLRs353.1 billion for 2004 compared with SLRs330.2 billion in 2003, an \nincrease of 6.9%. Public investment also increased to a provisional SLRs361.9 billion in 2004 \ncompared with SLRs334.5 billion in 2003, an increase of 8.2% over the same period in 2003. \n \n18.  On  the  revenue  side,  the  performance  was  slightly  more  promising.  Despite  the \ncarryover of outstanding revenue loopholes from 2003, total revenues in the first half of 2004 \nreached a provisional figure of SLRs143.1 billion compared with SLRs136.8 billion during the \nsame period a year earlier, an increase of 4.6%. These loopholes included (i) administrative \nshortcomings; (ii) the complexity in determining types of value-added tax (VAT) bases and \n(iii) high refund incidences. Nevertheless, the Government has responded by tidying up loose \nends  and  in  September  2004,  amendments  to  the  VAT4  and  Inland  Revenue  acts  were \nsubmitted to Parliament.  \n \n19.  Deepening of audit measures also had a positive impact and contributed SLRs2.7 billion \nto revenue collection during the first half of 2004. Of this amount, SLRs1.2 billion was collected \nfrom VAT and SLRs0.9 billion from income tax. The customs department also exceeded its \ntarget for the first half of 2004 having collected total revenues of SLRs82.4 billion against the \ntargeted revenue of SLRs74 billion. Buoyed by strong imports, including higher oil prices and \nmore recently the impact of the depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee, VAT collection on imports \nwas SLRs33.7 billion against a target of SLRs31.9 billion. On the negative side, corporate \nincome tax collection, however, was a disappointing 64% of the target for the first 6 months of \n2004. This reflected a combination of investment allowances and lower profits due to offsetting \nlosses traced to restructuring measures in some cases and the writing off of bad debts on the \npart of banks.5 On the nontax revenue side, privatization receipts during the first half of 2004 \nwere SLRs2.4 billion against an annual target of SLRs13 billion. Similarly, central bank profits\u2014\na major source of nontax earnings in 2003\u2014totaled only SLRs1 billion in the first half of 2004, \nagainst an annual target of SLRs5 billion. \n \nB.  The Government\u2019s Reform Program \n \n20.  The  Government  has  responded  to  the  fiscal  challenge  by  placing  reforms  to  the \nrevenue administration at the forefront of the economic reform agenda with the objective of \nsetting  public  finances  on  a  sustainable  path.  (See  Appendix  1  for  the  fiscal  program \nunderpinning the Government\u2019s new Economic Policy Framework and Supplementary Appendix \n4 for an analysis of the primary balance and debt sustainability.) \n \n                                                 \n4  VAT is estimated to generate 45% of total tax revenue in Sri Lanka. \n5  This also brings to light the weakness in the preparation of revenue estimates. \n ", "6 \n21.  The Government\u2019s reform program for strengthening public finances is based on a three-\npillar  strategy:  a  revamped  fiscal  framework  established  under  the  Fiscal  Management \n(Responsibility)  Act,  an  enabling  policy  environment  in  the  form  of  an  overhauled  and \nstreamlined  taxation  policy,  and  institutional  strengthening  of  the  revenue  administration \nsupported by the creation of a modernized revenue administration. \n \n22.  The Government is committed to the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act, approved \nby Parliament in January 2003, albeit with a delay that reflects the impact of the 2004 elections \nand more recently the external oil shock. The Act requires the Government to reduce the overall \nbudget deficit to 5% of GDP and total debt to 85% of GDP, respectively, in a phased manner, by \nthe end of 2006. It will also contribute to greater fiscal transparency and accountability, as the \nGovernment is required to report to Parliament every 6 months on the performance relative to \nthe intended fiscal objectives. (See Appendix 2 for a description of the Government\u2019s fiscal \nobjectives and reporting requirements under the Act.) The Government\u2019s Medium-Term Fiscal \nProgram (2005\u20132008) (MTFP) (see Supplementary Appendix 5) released in November 2004, \nhowever, targets a 5.7% of GDP budget deficit by the end of 2007 and 4.4% of GDP by end of \n2008. \n \n23.  A centerpiece of the reform agenda is the strengthening of the revenue administration. \nThe Modernization of the Revenue Administration (MRA) aims to integrate into one Revenue \nBoard the various revenue department heads including inland revenue, customs and excise \ndepartments. The Revenue Board will be a semiautonomous corporate body chaired by the \ncommissioner general of the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) and with a chief executive \nofficer (CEO) reporting to a board of directors. The Revenue Board will have authority over all \naspects of revenue administration and will be based on the improved coordination of core \nfunctions of inland revenue, customs and excise departments. A new human resource policy will \nbe designed based on a more flexible and competency-acquired employment system; it will also \nprovide  for  an  improved  incentives  scheme.  As  part  of  the  reforms  to  human  resource \ndevelopment, IRD has already announced the promotion of 620 of the better performing IRD \nstaff  from  tax  collectors  to  tax  assessors.  In  addition,  a  new  information  technology  (IT) \ndevelopment strategy will be introduced based on the automation of tax administration and \nthereby contribute toward e-government. \n \n24.  The MTFP seeks to achieve a stable macroeconomic environment supported by policies \nthat focus on generating revenue, thereby augmenting fiscal space to ensure greater investment \nand  stable  growth.  On  the  revenue  side,  supported  by  the  FMRP\u2019s  modernizing  and \nstrengthening of the revenue departments, overall revenues are targeted to increase by 3.3 \npercentage points from 15.6% of GDP in 2004 to 18.9% in 2007 (19.5% in 2008). This reflects \nan expected strong increase in tax revenues from 14.1% of GDP in 2004 to 17.1% in 2007 and \na moderate increase in nontax revenues from 1.5% to 1.8% during the same period. On the \nexpenditure side, the FMRP balances cutbacks in current expenditure in favor of increases in \npublic investment with the aim of accelerating the national infrastructure development program, \nincluding expanding rural infrastructure facilities and supporting human resource development \nfacilities. Indeed, total expenditures are targeted to increase moderately from 24.2% of GDP \nexpected in 2004 to 24.6% by 2007 (and a decline to 23.9% in 2008); however, this is based on \na reduction of current expenditure by 2.6 percentage points to 16.7% of GDP in 2007 and an \nincrease in public investment by 2.8 percentage points to 7.8% of GDP in 2007 (and 7.9% in \n2008). The budget deficit is targeted to decline from 8.6% of GDP in 2004 to 5.7% in 2007 (and \n4.4% in 2008). \n ", "  7\n \n25.  As a means to enhance revenue, the 2005 Budget presented on 18 November 2004 \nincludes a comprehensive set of revenue  measures. Revenue policy  measures reflect the \nintroduction  of:  (i)  higher  excise  duty  rates  on  various  luxury  (and  non-luxury)  items;  (ii) \nincreased customs valuation of 5% across a range of intermediate and final imported goods \ntogether with an additional 10% excise duty levied on these goods; and (iii) increases in import \ncess (duty) as well as port and airport levies. In addition, civil servants will be brought into the \ntax net and will become liable for pay-as-you-earn (PAYE). Finally, income tax will be applied at \na 15% rate, up to a threshold, with step-wise marginal rate increases up to 30%. VAT bands will \nbe expanded (after the previous government had consolidated them) from 0% and 15% to 0%, \n5%, 15% and 18%. While the standard rate is 15%, a basic commodity rate on essential food \nitems will be introduced at 5% and a luxury rate of 18% will be applied to selected consumer \nitems. The recently introduced Economic Service Charge (ESC) will be reduced to 0.5% of \nwholesale or retail trade from 1%. In a nod to the business community, and with the view to \ndeepening the corporate debt market, withholding tax on corporate debt will be removed and \nonly the final tax retained. A host of existing deductions on corporate taxes will be tightened. On \nnon-tax measures the major item includes profits from central bank operations. Financing of the \nbudget will also benefit from privatization of assets from the hospitality industry. In total, revenue \nmeasures are projected to lead to a 1.6 percentage points increase in revenues in 2005 to \n17.2% of GDP. (See Supplementary Appendix 6 for the economic classification of revenue by \ncomponent.)  \n \n26.  Expenditure rationalization measures will need to accommodate a 40% increase of \ncurrent basic salary of civil servants starting in December 2004. While the exact increase is \ndetermined by a formula according to pay scales, the overall wage bill is projected to increase \nby approximately 27% in 2005 (against an estimated 10% increase in inflation). This increase in \nthe wage bill subsumes an increase of 42,000 new recruits into the civil service in 2004. In \nparallel, pension payments will increase by 15% of basic pension effective from December \n2004. Other expenditure cutback measures will include introducing procurement management, \ntighter  expenditure  controls,  and  improved  accounting  and  auditing  standards.  (See \nSupplementary Appendix 7 for the economic classification of expenditure and lending minus \nrepayment.)  In  addition,  debt  management  treasury  functions  are  being  strengthened  to \nrestructure higher-cost with lower-cost debt. Public enterprises will also be restructured, both \noperationally and financially, to reduce their dependence on budgetary support. Finally public \nexpenditure programs will be reprioritized according to the Government\u2019s pledge to increase \nsupport for rural development in line with improved cost efficiency and better quality of services.  \n \nC.  Issues and Opportunities \n \n27.  Against this backdrop, activities in the past 2 years under the previous Government have \nbeen impressive in the range and breadth of the systems introduced to address the problems. \nThe real question facing Sri Lanka is not whether the determination to solve the problem of \npersistent budget deficits exists\u2013\u2013indeed even the new Government is keenly aware that there \nis no alternative even if 2004 has been a lost year\u2014but whether these activities are likely to \nsucceed. In many cases, success will depend on understandings and actions in areas where \nstrategies are currently being developed, including  public sector pay, persistently loss-making \nparastatal corporations, the narrow tax base, the development of an effective tax collection \nadministration, the integration of medium-term planning with the annual budget round, control \nover liabilities created by past promises, effective fiscal devolution, and the pressures that a \n ", "8 \nrapidly  aging  population  will  put  on  the  national  budget.6  The  success  of  the  proposed \ngovernment reform program will be closely linked to concrete measures to address these issues \nas they are ultimately related to the wider goals of strengthening public finance. \n \n28.  The following provides a diagnostic of some of the more critical constraints in three core \nareas under FMRP, namely, revenue collection, budget programming and expenditure controls, \nand fiscal decentralization. The assessment of these constraints will set the stage for the \nprogram-supported proposed reform solutions. \n \n1.  Constrained Revenue Collection \n \n29.  Revenue collection in Sri Lanka is constrained by various factors. The most critical of \nthese is a weak and underfunded tax administration and a tax policy regime that effectively \ndiscourages timely taxpayer compliance. Accordingly, the tax base is very narrow comprising \n789,221 PAYE taxpayers and 194,824 income taxpayers, including 19,582 corporate taxpayers \nof which 2,850 paid income tax in 2003. Moreover, there is a large parallel economy; granting of \ntax holidays is a frequent practice; civil servants are exempt from paying income tax; and the \nretail and wholesale sectors are exempt from VAT. Furthermore, tax collectors tend to arbitrarily \nsanction the legitimate taxpayers, often reflecting poorly designed incentive clauses and lack of \ntaxpayer rights. \n \n30.  More  generally,  there  is  a  compartmentalized  and  fragmented  approach  to  tax \nadministration reflecting institutional constraints that hinder effective tax administration. This is \ntraced to deep-rooted segmentation between inland revenue, customs and excise departments, \neach  having  its  own  distinct  institutional  culture.  Lack  of  resources  has  undermined  the \ndevelopment of skilled and specialized tax administration staff as well as the modernization of \nintegrated IT systems across tax departments. Reforms to human resource development and IT \nsystems  would  thus  prove  critical  in  exploiting  economies  of  scale  and  lead  to  positive \nexternalities from sharing functions across different tax departments. \n \n31.  To aggravate matters, the tax regime is beset by distortions of various types. First, \ntaxation policy in Sri Lanka has traditionally been used as a means to attract investment through \ntax holidays and other tax concessions, and thereby redirect resources to selected sectors of \nthe  economy.  Taxation  policy  has  thus  remained  subservient  to  industrial  policies  to  the \ndetriment  of  effective  tax  collection,  but  also  creating  additional  sources  of  \u201ctax  leakage,\u201d \nthereby increasing the costs of effective enforcement. Second, governments have frequently \nresorted to tax amnesties or exonerations, which have proven costly to the state. Indeed, the \n2003 general tax amnesty represents the 11th time in 40 years that a tax amnesty has been \ngranted in Sri Lanka. This has resulted in lost potential tax revenue, as tax collectors forfeit \nrevenues from the backlog of tax arrears under investigation. More detrimentally, tax amnesties \nhave seldom had much impact in terms of increasing either tax revenue or the tax net. The \namnesties prove even more costly to the state in terms of induced moral hazard. Indeed, \nnegative  signaling  results  from  the  Government\u2019s  actions  to  future  taxpayers  (i.e.,  nontax \nregistered/nontax-declaring corporations and individuals) who will reason that they are better off \nremaining outside the tax net and waiting for a future amnesty. \n \n2.  Weak Budget Programming and Expenditure Control Framework \n \n32.  Budget programming in Sri Lanka is in an evolving state and has yet to benefit from a \nfull-fledged, medium-term budget programming and expenditure framework. Critical constraints \n                                                 \n6  A more detailed analysis of these issues was presented to the Government under an ADB-funded report, Structural \nFiscal Imbalances in Sri Lanka, August 2003. ", "  9\n \ninclude systems and procedures within the budget department, which prevent line departments \nfrom effective management of a steady stream of committed yet discontinuously disbursed \nresources.  In  particular,  there  is  limited  predictability  in  the  allocation  of  revenues  across \ndepartments and over time, given the narrow outreach of the existing framework. For example, \nthe  budget  department  is  only  now  beginning  to  introduce  international  practices  in  using \nforward estimate techniques for budget programming. In addition, the budgeting framework has \ninherent limitations resulting from an outdated classification system that fails to link up current \nand capital expenditures. These constraints often result in difficulties in ensuring effective and \ntimely resource allocation, thereby limiting the returns from public investment projects. \n \n33.  In a related area, expenditure control systems are weak and difficult to enforce within the \ncontext of revenue streams that are discontinuous over time and subject to the fluctuations of \nexternal shocks and, more generally, the business cycle. This creates difficulties in expenditure \nmanagement as expenditure (and revenue) targets are often missed. Against this background, \nSri Lanka needs to pursue effective fiscal consolidation if the structural deficits are to be \nreduced. Over time, automatic stabilizers will become effective in helping to steer the economy \nby provisioning during boom years and using these savings to make up for the revenue shortfall \nin downturns. In the meantime, effective fiscal consolidation will be critical in supporting the \nGovernment\u2019s macroeconomic stabilization efforts. \n \n34.  Control  systems  are  also  constrained  by  limited  monitoring  capability  of  off-budget \nexpenditures and borrowings. The problem is exacerbated by a lack of clear procedures and \ntreasury systems for registering and managing financial obligations. As a result, unaccounted \ncommitments across departments often accumulate, which eventually become due and have to \nbe liquidated by the Government imposing further and at times, sudden \u201cleakages\u201d on the \nexpenditure side. \n \n3.  Limited Fiscal Decentralization \n \n35.  From a public policy perspective, fiscal decentralization can be welfare enhancing as it \nbrings spending (and revenue) powers and decisions closer to those who will most benefit from \nthese public projects. The more typical of these delegated public expenditure assignments are, \nfor example, road maintenance, local irrigation, schools, and community health posts. These \nspending initiatives are often the ones that have the highest effect on poverty reduction. Hence, \nsupporting effective fiscal decentralization can enhance poverty reduction. \n \n36.  With  the  approval  of  the  13th  amendment  of  the  Constitution  in  1987,  the  legal \nunderpinning  for  devolution  of  power  from  the  center  to  the  provinces  was  established. \nHowever, neither self-sufficiency of subnational government nor efficiency considerations in the \nfiscal framework was part of the underlying principles. Henceforth, and despite the introduction \nof reforms granting spending and revenue powers to provincial councils (PCs), there has been \nlimited fiscal devolution. Provincial governments spend only about 10\u201311% of the combined \nexpenditure of the center and the provinces, and own revenue accounts for less than 17% of \ntheir expenditures. This has led to a vertical imbalance between the provinces and the center, \nthereby fostering dependency. There are also significant horizontal imbalances across PCs. \n \n37.  Piecemeal  and  limited  devolution,  however,  has  not  prevented  the  overlapping  of \nfunctions and responsibilities between central and provincial departments of the administration. \nThis has resulted in a misuse of scarce resources that is compounded by the fact that salaries \nof provincial civil service staff account for over 65% of provincial government total expenditures \nwhile  capital  expenditures  account  for  only  16%.  On  the  institutional  side,  a  Finance \n ", "10 \nCommission oversees fiscal devolution. However, a combination of limited decentralization skills \nand  resources  and  weak  accountability  has  resulted  in  limited  progress  in  meeting  the \nobjectives of the 13th amendment. \n \n38.  These weaknesses are overshadowed by a more critical factor in the form of a poorly \ndesigned, combined block and matching grant formula for intergovernment revenue transfers. \nThe nature of the formula is such that it creates moral hazard by effectively discouraging greater \neffort of revenue mobilization at the provincial level and further entrenching dependency. This is \ndue to the fact that for any additional revenues generated at the provincial level from the \nmatching grant element, there is an almost offsetting loss of block grant from the center, \nresulting in only a net marginal gain to the province. As a result, block grants accounted for 81% \nof total intergovernment transfers versus 1% for matching grants in 2003. (See Supplementary \nAppendix 8 for expenditure and revenues at the PCs and intergovernment transfers.) \n \n39.  Finally, capital expenditure funding from the center to the provinces is based solely on \ngrant financing. A move toward debt financing over the medium-term and subject to increased \nabsorptive capacity could free up additional resources and help create greater incentives for the \nprovinces to make more productive use of these funds. \n \n4.  Lessons Learned \n \n40.  ADB has had limited experience in operational support for fiscal management reforms. \nHowever, ADB has had relevant experience in public expenditure management reforms. A \nspecial  evaluation  study7  raised  important  issues,  highlighting  that  \u201cpublic  expenditure \nmanagement is a core function of governments and that external assistance needs to build a \ngovernment\u2019s capacities to fulfill these functions.\u201d The FMRP follows this approach with the \nthrust  on  developing  and  implementing  systems  and  procedures  to  ensure  effective  and \nsustainable compliance with fiscal objectives. \n41.  The  study  also  stressed  that  \u201cownership  is  one  of  the  key  ingredients  to  develop \ncapacities,\u201d which entails conducting policy dialogue and capacity mapping. There was no better \nexample  in  this  regard  than  the  shortcomings  in  the  previous  Government\u2019s  unsuccessful \nattempt to introduce the concept of the Sri Lanka Revenue Authority (SLRA). While the concept \nhad  some  very  good  initiatives,  the  process  was  not  satisfactorily  managed,  with  limited \nownership among critical stakeholders and ultimately set aside by the new Government. The \ncapacity mapping, in turn, should focus on a comprehensive approach to the budget cycle, \nintegrating the various agencies involved, instead of focusing on one core agency. \n42.  The FMRP follows this approach by strengthening coordination of participating agencies \nacross a wide spectrum, providing institutional support to these agencies, and introducing policy \nreforms that promote a more enabling, fiscally sustainable, environment. As part of institutional \nstrengthening, the focus will be on creating a coordinated revenue administration based on \ndeveloping greater commonality in core functions through IT integration and more supportive, \nand  incentives-based,  human  resource  development  policies.  Furthermore,  the  FMRP  will \ninclude an assessment of the performance of the revenue administration toward the end of the \nFMRP, based on institutional performance indicators to be designed as part of the supporting \nmodernization strategies. Subject to a favorable assessment of the revenue administration \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2000.

", "  11\n \nreforms and continued government support, there may be scope for deeper integration of \nrevenue administration reforms over the medium-term.  \n43.  The FMRP has benefited from close coordination with development partners, particularly \nthe International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Blueprints for modernization plans \nfor the revenue departments were discussed at a workshop hosted by Canada Customs and \nRevenue Agency and organized by ADB and IMF in early 2003. Close coordination between \nADB and the Government has also been critical. A task list or road map for the modernization of \nthe revenue administration was proposed by ADB and presented to senior management of the \nMinistry of Finance and Planning (MOFP) at a workshop in January 2004 and chaired by the \nsecretary to the treasury (para. 55). \n \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.  Objectives and Scope \n \n44.  ADB  together  with  IMF  had  been  supporting  the  previous  Government\u2019s  fiscal \nframework, in particular, the implementation of public resource and expenditure management \nreforms under the erstwhile Regaining Sri Lanka. (See Appendix 3 for the list of background \nstudies and chronology of events in the processing of the FMRP.) The FMRP builds on this \ninitial support and following two rounds of intensive policy dialogue with the new Government \nhas amended the FMRP in line with the new Government\u2019s fiscal management priorities. In \nsummary, the revisions reflect primarily a stronger focus on revenue augmentation efforts, and a \nprioritization on fiscal consolidation consistent with enhanced capital spending. \n \n45.  The  proposed  ADB  assistance  is  to  comprise  a  program  (policy)  loan  component \ntargeting critical policy measures in support of fiscal management reforms, a project loan in \nsupport of institutional strengthening focusing on establishing the MRA, and another project loan \nin  support  of  capacity  building  to  assist  in  the  implementation  of  policy  and  institutional \nstrengthening components of the fiscal management institutions. The FMRP will support the \nGovernment\u2019s reform agenda and provide, in particular, support for fiscal consolidation through \nassistance for improving public resource and expenditure management systems, promoting \nfiscal discipline, and supporting fiscal decentralization. More generally, the FMRP will help \ncreate an enabling environment to foster mobilization of tax revenues, improve effectiveness of \npublic expenditures and, ultimately, place public finances on a sustainable path. \n \nB.  Program Loan \n \n1.  Objectives \n \n46.  The  FMRP  will  seek  to  strengthen  public  finances  by  improving  resource  and \nexpenditure  management  systems,  promoting  fiscal  discipline,  and  supporting  fiscal \ndecentralization. \n \n2.  Goals and Outputs \n \n47.  The FMRP has five goals: (i) improving effectiveness of tax administration, (ii) improving \nthe budget framework,  (iii) improving public expenditure management and control systems, \n(iv) strengthening fiscal discipline, and (v) improving fiscal coordination including supporting the \ngroundwork for fiscal decentralization.  \n ", "12 \n \n48.  A list of policy recommendations has been identified with the purpose of addressing the \nsector constraints identified above. The set of time-bound policy actions proposed under the \nFMRP  and  the  development  policy  letter  are  in  Appendix  4.  The  FMRP  framework  is  in \nAppendix 5. \n \n3.  Policy Framework and Actions  \n \n49.  The program loan (policy component) focuses on key measures for improved fiscal \nmanagement and sustainable compliance with fiscal objectives. \n \na.  Improving Effectiveness of Tax Administration \n \ni.  Creation of a Modernized Revenue Administration   \n \n50.  To address the fragmented and compartmentalized nature of the revenue administration, \nthe Program will set the foundations for the reorganization of the three departments under a \nunified Revenue Board. The Revenue Board will be established based on three key principles of \nmoving toward greater operational autonomy, coordinating better the core common functions, \nand creating the basis for a merit-based employment policy. Based on the performance of the \nreforms, the Government will review the prospects of deeper integration toward the end of the \nFMRP. \n  \n51.  Moving toward greater operational autonomy\u2014or government delegation of the powers \nto ensure effective revenue collection\u2014will shield the revenue administration from political or \nother vested interests and, accordingly, represents an important step forward. Full autonomy is \nnot being pursued under the FMRP, as the revenue administration will continue to be financially \ndependent  on  the  Government.  Nevertheless,  the  Revenue  Board  and  the  revenue \nadministration in general will follow best practices on transparency and accountability as part of \nincreased  autonomy.  This  would  include  strengthening  reporting  requirements  and  greater \naccountability to Parliament and to the public. \n \n52.  Limited resources and a host of separately managed, common functions across inland \nrevenue, customs and excise departments underline the need for functional integration. As a \nfirst step, the FMRP  will support common IT and human resource development programs \nacross revenue departments. There will also be a coordinated effort to introduce common \nstandards across tax collection and accounts, taxpayer services, tax audit and investigation, \nlegal services, inspection, and training. \n \n53.  Ultimately,  functional  integration  requires  a  revamping  of  employment  policies.  The \nFMRP  sets  in  practice  a  thrust  toward  staff  specialization,  which  will  facilitate  longer-term \nfunctional integration. Staff specialization, in turn, will require a change in mindset, opening up \ngreater opportunities for those who are willing to take on this challenge. Certainly, not all will \nstand  to  benefit  and  this  will  require  political  will  to  usher  in  new  policies  based  on  a \ncompetency-acquired  and  merit-based  employment  system.  However,  specialization  is \nconsidered  a  necessary  policy  direction  in  support  of  the  modernization  of  the  revenue \nadministration and will form part of creating better incentives for workers who will be endowed \nwith the training needed to improve performance. \n \n54.  The Government is committed to  this undertaking and is aware that the three key \nprinciples outlined above are an integral part of the institutional reform process. Any piecemeal ", "  13\n \napproach consisting of the adoption of any one of these principles without the others is bound to \ncall into question the likely success of the reform process. The Cabinet, in one of its first \neconomic  policy  decisions,  approved  a  memorandum  on  3  June  2004  supporting  the \nmodernization of the department of inland revenue, including its restructuring, thereby setting \nthe stage for the transformation of the revenue administration. \n \n55.  The creation of a modernized revenue administration will take time. Capacity building \nand procurement of key IT components will promote a gradual and effective modernization \nreform  program  of  the  revenue  administration.  A  key  design  feature  of  the  FMRP  is  its \ncommitment  to  avoiding  disruptions  to  tax  revenue  collection.  Some  of  the  more  critical \nintermediate  steps  identified  in  the  modernization  program  for  the  revenue  administration \ninclude: (i) the establishment of the Revenue Board; (ii) the appointment of a CEO; (iii) the \ndesign and approval of modernization strategies for the different arms of the authority inland \nrevenue, customs, and excise departments; and (iv) the design and approval of strategies for \nhuman resource development and an integrated IT plan. (See Appendix 6 for a plan of activities \nor task list to support the modernization program of the revenue administration.) IMF had \nprepared  drafts  under  (iii) above  and  the  Strengthening  of  Fiscal  Management  Institutions \nproject loan will support (iv) among others. \n \nii.  Strengthening Tax Collection and Compliance \n \n56.  To complement effective tax administration, the FMRP seeks to strengthen tax collection \nand tax compliance. To begin, the tax net will be broadened. This will involve implementing the \nEconomic Service Charge, removing income tax exemptions on nongovernment salaries of civil \nservants (paras. 87\u201388 below), and rationalizing the use of tax holidays on investment. \n \n57.  In addition to widening the tax net, MOFP will establish a central accounts database that \nprovides  a  uniform  system  of  numbering  and  the  ability  to  cross  check  related  taxpayer \ntransaction  and  revenue  information.  Furthermore,  MOFP  will  approve  clear  regulations \nestablishing a unique and unified taxpayer identification number (TIN). While there is a TIN in \nplace it suffers from various deficiencies, which undermines its effectiveness. First, it is not \ncompulsory. Second, it is not unified across revenue departments. Third, some taxpayers are \nthought to have multiple TINs. The new TIN will be designed to address these issues and \nthereby serve as a critical instrument in monitoring compliance of tax payments and facilitate \ntargeted enforcement. As part of this process, the tax registry will need to be strengthened, as \nthe current system requires updating, with particular attention to cleaning out defunct and \nmultiple name taxpayers. \n \n58.  However, effective tax compliance will require persuasive enforcement on the part of the \nrevenue administration and complementary institutions. Accordingly, it is expected that by the \nend of the FMRP the TIN will be used in a comprehensive manner and required in day-to-day \nactivities such as opening a bank account and purchasing property. To strengthen enforcement, \nthe FMRP will also support the development of a central accounts database for tax collection \npurposes and linked to the TIN. \n \n59.  International experience suggests that investing in taxpayer services goes a long way in \nincreasing  tax  revenues.  The  modernization  of  the  revenue  administration  will  include  the \ncreation of a new Taxpayer Service and Education Department. The move toward considering \ntaxpayers as clients is part of this change in focus of the new revenue administration. Education \nof clients in taxpayer filing and other essential services are also being integrated into the reform \nprogram. To ensure that taxpayer or client rights are being ensured, the FMRP also calls for \n ", "14 \nMOFP to prepare and approve a Taxpayer Bill of Rights and Duties. Along these lines, the \nFMRP also supports the appointment of a tax ombudsperson to oversee and uphold taxpayer \n(client) rights. \n \n60.  In order to enhance tax collection and compliance, reporting requirements are to be \nstrengthened in the Large Taxpayer Unit (LTU). The LTU covers about 1,300 companies and \naccounts for 85% of corporate tax revenues in Sri Lanka. Increasing reporting requirements will \nallow for greater compliance and can serve as a monitoring mechanism by the MRA to assess \ncompliance across companies. As a means of facilitating efficient processing of tax files, and in \norder to set the foundations of the management information system (MIS), the FMRP supports \nmoving toward a fully electronic tax filing system by companies registered under LTU by 2006. \n \n61.  In addition, as part of the improved systems and procedures specifically related to \nstreamlining processing and reporting requirements, the FMRP  will see to it that the LTU \nappoints individual account managers across all targets for the largest 1,000 taxpayers. These \nindividual account managers will be responsible for all tax administration services for each \nparticular  taxpayer,  equivalent  to  establishing  an  individualized  one-stop  taxpayer-servicing \noutlet. Finally, the Government also commits under the FMRP to revise the tax code in order to \nconsolidate all revisions under an updated and user-friendly, single reference instrument. \n \nb.  Improving the Budget Framework \n \ni.  Streamlining Budgeting Procedures \n \n62.  Sri Lanka operates a traditional, centralized, and compliance-based budget system. A \nset of policy objectives is determined at the beginning of the cycle. Subsequently, and following \na process of review where sector spending limits are set based on an expenditure framework, \nresources are committed to the spending agencies to meet these objectives. Budget execution \nfollows, with ensuing disbursements based on agreed-on appropriations. Finally, rudimentary ex \npost monitoring takes place with limited accountability for the implementation of line ministries\u2019 \nprograms. (See Supplementary Appendix 9 for a summary of the national budget process.) \n \n63.  Ambiguities in the established budget classification system together with difficulties in \nenforcing hard budget constraints on spending agencies translate into limited ability to manage \nexpenditure plans. To make matters worse, actual expenditures are not always in line with \napproved budgets and the flexibility needed to adjust fiscal aggregates is not in place. In \naddition, forward expenditure estimates seldom go beyond 1 year. Under the FMRP, MOFP is \nintroducing  an  internationally  accepted  budget  classification  system  and  is  implementing \neffective expenditure ceilings to strengthen budget management. (See Supplementary Appendix \n10 for a summary of the budget classification system.) In addition, through ADB technical \nassistance (TA),8 MOFP introduced in the 2004 budget 3-year rolling forward estimates of \ncurrent and capital budgets based on a medium-term budget programming and expenditure \nframework. \n \n64.  Other reforms under the FMRP will include amending the budget circular by fixing a firm \ndate for its issuance to ensure ample time for budget preparation and so avoid the disturbances \nrelated  to  a  relatively  tight  budget  calendar.  Similarly,  to  enhance  intra-year  budgeting \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for Strengthening Public \nExpenditure Management Systems. Manila (TA 3301-SRI, which commenced in January 2000 and was finalized in \nJuly 2003). ", "  15\n \nadjustments and improve timely delivery of resources, a transparent supplementary budget \nappropriations system will be developed to reduce the ad hoc nature of adjustments. The \nsystem will be complemented with timely reporting requirements. \n \n65.  Further reforms under the FMRP include establishing guidelines for use of advance \naccounts and unifying capital and current budget procedures. These measures will serve to \nimprove budget management and overall efficiency, given common linkages between the two \nsets of procedures. \n \n66.  A review of the budget preparation process suggests the need to strengthen certain \naspects linked to integration and coordination of budget estimates. In particular, on the capital \nexpenditures side, policy and implementation activities need to be more closely integrated.9 \nIndeed,  in  the  recent  past,  while  the  National  Planning  Department  was  responsible  for \nidentifying capital expenditure ceilings across line ministries, Regaining Sri Lanka provided the \npolicy framework for identification of capital spending requirements. Moreover the Regaining Sri \nLanka committees were, in turn, responsible for recommending and monitoring implementation \nof investment projects, calling into question the involvement of line ministries and the National \nPlanning Department. Following the election of the new Government, the responsibility for \nprioritization of core expenditures has been removed from the committees and returned to the \ncentral ministries in coordination with the line ministries. \n \n67.  In addition, as part of budget management reforms over the medium-term, the FMRP is \nsetting out preliminary actions supporting a reorientation toward results-based budgeting. The \nkey is to move gradually from a budget management system that focuses on inputs and how \nthey are employed to focusing on outputs and eventually outcomes and how they fulfill their \noriginal budget objectives. This phased approach recognizes that compliance-based systems \ntend to face complex restrictions that diminish the allocative and operational efficiency of budget \nexecution. In addition, accountability tends to be limited in terms of program results. Under the \nFMRP, MOFP will establish a working group or committee to oversee the change toward a \nsystem  that  introduces  elements  of  results-based  budgeting.  Indeed,  MOFP  has  already \nintroduced in the 2004 budget circular performance indicators at the central government level \nfor the purpose of moving toward results-based budgeting reporting. A move toward a results-\nbased budgeting system in fact could lead to fiscal stabilization objectives that complement, \nrather than compete with, efficiency objectives. However, this transformation in Sri Lanka needs \ntime,  and  the  compliance-oriented  systems  and  the  use  of  expenditure  controls  are  still \nexpected to prevail over the medium term. \n \nii.  Rationalizing Expenditures \n \n68.  As part of the Government\u2019s structural reform initiatives in support of rationalizing public \nresources, MOFP has issued a circular requesting all ministries to submit restructuring plans. \nThe FMRP will provide continuity to this initiative by supporting restructuring plans for key \nministries and the Western Province provincial council. The restructuring plans will include \nidentification of activities classified according to priority goals to support the mandate of the \nparticular ministry and the required inputs to meet those activities. Savings are to be identified \nfrom cost-cutting measures with a particular focus on reducing overlap across the sector, and \nthese may be allocated to other priority areas in the ministry. On a pilot basis, the Western \nProvince provincial council will undertake a similar restructuring exercise with a view to possible \n                                                 \n9  According to the World Bank\u2019s 1998 Public Expenditure Management Handbook, the failure to link policy making, \nplanning, and budgeting may be the single most important factor contributing to poor budgeting outcomes. \n ", "16 \nreplication in other PCs. These restructuring plans should be fully implemented by the end of \nthe FMRP. \n \nc.  Improving Public Expenditure Management and Control Systems \n  \ni.  Strengthening Management of Off-Budget Expenditures and \nBorrowings \n \n69.  With increased fiscal pressures, many countries have turned to off-budget financing \nthrough contingent and implicit liabilities as a means of deferring the recognition of committed \ncash expenditures. Conventional budget methodologies tend to ignore the proper accounting of \ncontingent liabilities except when a cash flow is created. As a result, financial accounting \nsystems generate insufficient data for adequate budgetary control of such policies. \n \n70.  The FMRP will focus on putting in place the required fiscal accounting framework to \nadequately address budget and off-budget expenditures and borrowings both on a cash and an \naccruals basis (on the latter, see para. 79). To begin with, MOFP will prepare guidelines for \nproper  classification  of  off-budget  liabilities  as  actual  or  contingent.  Second,  MOFP  is  to \nundertake actuarial balance analyses of the greatest sources of contingent liabilities, including \nboth government, i.e., social security and pension10 funds, and parastatal agencies, i.e., Ceylon \nElectricity Board and Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. Finally, MOFP is to prepare a feasibility \nstudy  on  funding  and  liquidating  government  liabilities  through  the  eventual  creation  of  a \nprovisioning fund. \n \n71.  The Government also operates various statutory and nonstatutory special funds. Many \nof these funds are permitted to raise revenues and spend outside the budgeting process. These \ninclude (i) the President\u2019s Special Fund of SLRs40 million\u201350 million financed by the national \nlottery, (ii) the Cess Fund of SLRs800 million funded by a levy on tea, and (iii) the Customs \nReward Fund funded by fines and sales proceeds. Two issues arise. First, from the perspective \nof budgetary program and planning, unless the funds are properly accounted for in the budget,11 \nefficient use of resources is compromised. Second, unless these funds are subject to published \nannual audits and other performance reporting, there is limited public accountability of the \nmeans and use of these funds. Under the FMRP, the Government commits to preparing an \nexhaustive  inventory  of  the  existing,  operating  funds  and  publishing  performance-reporting \nsystems. Under the FMRP, measures will be introduced to take stock of the magnitude of the \nproblem, adopt guidelines to prevent further build-up of off-budget liabilities on nonstatutory \nfunds and, finally, initiate measures to liquidate these liabilities. \n \nii.  Improving Budgetary Cash and Asset Management Systems \n \n72.  Poor cash management results in the tying up of scarce resources for unnecessarily \nlong periods of time. This may translate into costly delays of public projects through deferred \ncompletion dates or, in extreme circumstances, may lead to costly overdrafts or even bridge \nfinancing arrangements. Under the FMRP, MOFP will introduce a budgetary allotment system \nacross the budget year to synchronize with treasury receipts including transfers to other levels \nof government, and thereby minimize cash deferrals. \n \n                                                 \n10 According to Regaining Sri Lanka, there is an unfunded pension liability of approximately SLRs550 billion, which is \nincreasing due to a rapidly aging population.  \n11 A list of 31 such funds was provided by MOF but without details of amounts raised and disbursed. ", "  17\n \n73.  The introduction of a computerized and fully integrated Public Accounting and Financial \nManagement Information System (PAFMIS)\u2014to include (i) payroll, (ii) civil service pensions, \n(iii) drawing and disbursing offices, (iv) capital projects budget, and (v) public sector borrowing \nrequirements\u2014will be critical to improve expenditure management. The World Bank and the \nGovernment  of  the  Republic  of  Korea  are  providing  complementary  support  to  public \nexpenditure management. The World Bank is supporting the public expenditure review (PER) \nexercise with a view to prioritizing the Government\u2019s expenditure objectives across key sectors. \nThe Government of the Republic of Korea has had discussions on providing a credit line to the \nGovernment for the procurement of a PAFMIS. The FMRP will support the eventual integration \nof the PAFMIS with the proposed Revenue Administration Management Information System \n(RAMIS). \n \n74.  The current cash management system also adversely affects disbursement ratios for \nforeign aid projects, as counterpart funds are unavailable or available with significant lags. To \nimprove disbursement ratios, the National Budget Department along with the External Resource \nDepartment and the State Accounts Department will create an MIS to link foreign aid-related \ngovernment counterpart funds to budget implementation. This will include commitments, warrant \nrequests, and release of funds. \n \n75.  Finally, in order to strengthen management of government income streams, the State \nAccounts Department will develop an asset management system to support the monitoring and \nrecovery of government onlending activities. \n \nd.  Strengthening Fiscal Discipline \n \ni.  Improving Budget Estimates \n \n76.  As an important step to fiscal discipline, the new Government has established a Fiscal \nPolicy Committee under the leadership of the secretary to the treasury, which should provide an \nimportant source of discipline to budget design, preparation, execution, and monitoring. \n \n77.  However, the critical issue is the need to strengthen the process for the planning and \npreparation  of  the  budget.  In  the  past,  inputs  have  been  provided  by  the  Fiscal  Policy \nDepartment, National Budget Department, CBSL, and the revenue administration. However, the \nprocess was rather fragmented, lacking effective coordination and limiting the interaction, thus \nstraining efforts to achieve consensus. Often the pressure fell on the revenue administration, \nwhich tended to have its initial revenue estimates raised given the assumptions underlying the \neconomy. Accordingly, budget outturns often missed budget estimates, resulting in difficulties in \nachieving fiscal targets (para. 83). The FMRP will support effective coordination by establishing \na budget preparation consulting process, gathering all of the relevant MOFP departments and \nrevenue administrations to discuss and reach agreement on realistic and credible annual and \nmedium-term revenue estimates. \n \n78.  To improve budget estimates, MOFP will also need to properly account for items that are \ncurrently off the budget. Under the FMRP, MOFP will build on actions under section 3.a. above \nto assist State Accounts Department to (i) develop guidelines and reporting procedures to \nmonitor all commitments accumulated by government departments, (ii) prepare and update the \nregistrar on such commitments, and (iii) publish the commitment details on the Government\u2019s \nweb site. \n \n ", "18 \n79.  Another  key  government  policy  involves  moving  current  cash-based  government \naccounting procedures toward an accrual-based accounting system by 2008. As part of this \nbroad objective, the Government, supported by FMRP, has agreed to integrate accruals-based \naccounting systems on government accounts for (i) movable government assets and (ii) the net \npositions of public enterprises. \n \n80.  Finally,  extending  earlier  work  initiated  under  the  Public  Expenditure  Management \nSystems project, a key policy action will involve deepening the expenditure ceilings framework. \nThis will consist of improving the determination of ceilings based on a more rigorous analysis of \nexpenditure priorities. Assumptions and scenarios underlying the establishment of such ceilings \nwill be prepared in conjunction with the treasury\u2019s Economic Policy Research Department and \nwith a closer link to the macroeconomic program and the CBSL. In addition, the Government is \nestablishing a commitment monitoring system in the National Budget Department to begin in \n2005 to improve budget planning and management. \n \nii.  Increasing Fiscal Transparency through Improved Reporting \nProcedures \n \n81.  The  latest  IMF  Report  on  the  Observance  of  Standards  and  Codes  on  fiscal \ntransparency in Sri Lanka highlights achievements, including a reasonably well-developed legal \nand administrative framework for fiscal management and the publication of comprehensive \nfiscal  accounts.  However,  areas  that  need  strengthening  remain,  including  systematic \naccounting of off-budget liabilities, parliamentary oversight, and audit. \n \n82.  Key  fiscal  transparency  and  parliamentary  oversight  responsibilities  fall  to  the \nGovernment by virtue of the recent Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act (and according to \nobjectives highlighted in para. 22 above). In particular, under the Act, the Government will \nprepare  a  fiscal  strategy  statement,  increase  public  awareness  of  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal \npolicy, and establish standards for evaluating the Government\u2019s conduct of its fiscal strategy. In \naddition, MOFP will be responsible for presenting in Parliament a budget economic and fiscal \nposition report. The report will set out the Government\u2019s fiscal performance and key estimates \nand assumptions on fiscal accounts for the current and 2 succeeding fiscal years. An additional \nmidyear  fiscal  position  report  will  be  prepared  by  the  Minister  of  Finance  to  explain  any \ndeviations  from  stated  fiscal  objectives.  To  date,  reporting  requirements  have  been  fully \ncomplied with, including the presentation of the Preelection Budgetary Position Report in March \n2004. \n \n83.  Realistic  revenue  targets  are  critical  to  strengthen  the  Government\u2019s  perceived \ncredibility,  especially  in  view  of  the  Fiscal  Management  (Responsibility)  Act.  However,  in \naddition to realistic revenue estimates, expenditure ceilings will also need to be tightly enforced. \nIndeed over the latest period for which data are available, 1999\u20132001, the average budget \noutturn as a share of the original estimate was 89% for revenue, 103% for current expenditure, \nand 71% for capital expenditure. To ensure greater discipline and maintain expenditures on \ntarget, MOFP has started publishing on its web site bulletins of monthly expenditures and \nrevenues, which track flows according to different classifications and over time. Subjecting the \nGovernment\u2019s public spending and revenue collection programs to public scrutiny is expected to \nraise general awareness and further enhance budget discipline. \n \n84.  Under the FMRP (as part of the assurances), MOFP will be required to achieve a high \ndegree of transparency in the reporting of contingent and implicit liabilities with the objective of \nstrengthening coverage in the Government\u2019s half-yearly statements. More specifically, MOFP ", "  19\n \nwill  report  on  the  general  Government\u2019s  financial  position,  both  on-  and  off-budget  items, \nincluding commitments, guarantees, and contingent liabilities. Along these lines, the FMRP will \nsupport initiatives so as to quantify the total value of off-budget expenditure and borrowing and \npropose means to (i) increase financial disclosure of off-budget expenditure and borrowing, \n(ii) transform such expenditure to on-budget items, and (iii) reduce possible distortions resulting \nfrom the modalities of off-budget expenditure and borrowing. \n \n85.  Improved  transparency  is  a  necessary  condition  for  effective  fiscal  discipline. \nAccordingly, the Government will continue its commitment to improve reporting requirements. In \naddition to the publication of monthly expenditure and revenue accounts, the Government will \nbegin publishing (i) results-based reporting standards including the auditing of all ministries with \nbudgetary commitments on an annual basis, and (ii) annual departmental accounts within a \nspecified  time  frame  by  2005.  An  important  reform  in  this  area  is  the  preparation  of  a \ncompendium of all treasury circulars for easy reference, which is to be made available as \noperations manuals for treasury officers. A more abbreviated version will also be made available \nto the public on the Government\u2019s web site. \n \niii.  Reducing Distortions \n \n86.  Past practices of granting exemptions to tax evaders has created moral hazard among \ntaxpayers and generated deep misgivings among potential future tax defaulters about coming \nclean and among honest taxpayers who feel cheated due to government leniency. Another set \nof distortions arises from the Government\u2019s involvement in directing tax exemptions through \nincome tax holidays and other misguided BOI incentive schemes to selected sectors of the \neconomy,  a  strategy  that  according  to  empirical  evidence  does  not  lead  to  the  intended \nobjectives  of  promoting  sustainable  investment.  According  to  Regaining  Sri  Lanka,  the \nestimated  revenue  losses  from  various  BOI  tax  concessions  amounted  to  2\u20133%  of  GDP \nannually. The FMRP will require the Government to halt these practices throughout the course \nof the FMRP (and beyond) and serve to create a level playing field for all eligible taxpayers (see \nAssurances, below). \n \n87.  Similarly, civil servants benefit from income tax exemption on their earned government \nincome. This is clearly a second best (or non-optimal) policy. While a policy of moving toward \nincreasing gross income and taxing the resulting income could result in resource equivalence on \nthe state accounts, it could lead to positive externalities. In particular, greater awareness of \ntaxation issues among the population and overall improved tax education resulting from these \nmeasures could improve compliance among taxpayers. In addition, equity concerns between \ntaxpayers and tax-exempt individuals would be smoothed, likely reducing tax-evasion behavior \nand supporting a wider tax net. Finally, taxing civil service income would increase the policy \ninstruments available to the Government to pursue income distribution measures. \n \n88.  More generally, tax exemption on civil service employment income cannot correct for a \ncivil service that is unable to match salaries in the private sector. Public sector employment \nreform is hence essential in terms of overcoming a binding constraint to economic growth and \nensuring the flexibility needed to adjust to a changing economy. Accordingly, the previous \nGovernment had introduced a requirement that all government employees be subject to income \ntax on their nongovernment incomes. In the maiden 2005 budget, the Government has made \nthe provisions for all civil servants to be liable for a PAYE coming into effect in 2005. However, \nto  reduce  opposition  to  this  reform,  the  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  has  accompanied  this \nmeasure by including a substantial civil service pay increase and a reprieve on PAYE, as \nincome will be (initially) assumed to be half of the gross salary.  \n ", "20 \n \ne.  Improving Fiscal Coordination \n \ni.  Strengthening Fiscal and Macroeconomic Coordination \n \n89.  Following the slippages in the fiscal deficit targets for 2004, the Government is expected \nto start anew on a fiscal consolidation strategy based on well-defined fiscal objectives and \nthereby adhere to the principles under the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act (Appendix \n2). The strategy recognizes the importance of unwinding domestic imbalances built up over the \nyears by containing fiscal deficits and reducing public debt. The adoption and implementation of \nclear objectives under the Act is an example of the benefits of strengthened macroeconomic \nand fiscal coordination and acknowledges the importance of fiscal consolidation as part of \noverall macroeconomic stabilization and sustainable GDP growth. \n \n90.  In parallel, and as part of greater integration of relevant departments in support of \neffective budgeting at the operational level, the Government has mobilized senior National \nPlanning  Department  officials  to  work  with  the  National  Budget  Department.  The  National \nPlanning Department has been strengthened through recruitment of specialists and is now \nassigned the responsibilities of formulating a broad public investment plan consistent with the \nmedium-term budget programming and expenditure framework. This should lead to an improved \narticulation of government policy priorities on the expenditure side by better aligning current and \ncapital  expenditure  requirements.  The  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  increasing  public \ninvestment underscores the need for these reforms, particularly in the elaboration of the public \ninvestment program. On debt management, the Government has decided to adopt a more \ngradual approach to creating an independent public debt management office. Accordingly, the \nGovernment  will  support  the  preparation  of  a  feasibility  study  to  review  the  merits  of  an \nindependent  public  debt  management  office.  In  the  meantime,  work  will  commence  on \ndeveloping a monitoring system for foreign and domestic liability management. \n \n91.  Other  measures to improve fiscal coordination will involve developing a web-based \nintegrated aid MIS, which is already in preparation with bilateral support from the Government of \nNorway. This system will serve to better monitor and track implementation of development \nassistance  projects  and  will  be  linked  to  the  proposed  PAFMIS  to  improve  realization  of \nbudgeted disbursement targets, thereby improving performance of foreign assistance. \n \nii.  Strengthening Fiscal Decentralization \n \n92.  Consolidation  of  the  peace  process  is  likely  to  be  closely  linked  to  progress  in \nstrengthening  subnational  governments.  This  will  inevitably  require  public  finances  to  be \nrestructured to accommodate these changes. While the exact nature of any future change to the \nfederal structure of government has yet to be defined, there are\u2014even at this early stage\u2014 \nwelfare-enhancing actions in support of fiscal decentralization that can be pursued by sub-\nnational governments independently of the chosen federal structure. While fiscal stress has \ndampened  fiscal  devolution  it  should  not  be  considered  an  impediment  to  further \ndecentralization.  More  importantly,  the  nature  of  the  reforms  suggested  under  the  FMRP \nessentially aims to bridge the gap between sanctioned devolution and the actual state of affairs. \n \n93.  Under the 13th amendment of the Constitution, introduced in 1987, the powers to be \ndevolved from the center to the provinces, via PCs, were clearly defined according to subject. \nThe underlying principle for devolution consists of the assignment of expenditure, revenues, and \ntransfers from the central government to the PCs. However, to date, these powers have not ", "  21\n \nbeen  fully  devolved.  Moreover,  neither  the  promotion  of  self-sufficiency  at  subnational \ngovernment level or efficiency at all government levels through the system of intergovernment \ntransfers was among the principles pursued in the 13th amendment. Many of the PCs have not \nfollowed through in approving the statutes for levying the relevant devolved taxes, resulting in \ndependency on the center. Average total revenue as a share of total expenditure across PCs in \n1998\u20132000 is estimated at 18%. The current situation has thus given the central Government \nand  line  ministries  the  rationale  to  maintain  their  presence  and  involvement  in  devolved \nsubjects, thereby fostering duplication of functions across various areas. \n \n94.  Deficiencies in the current arrangements are numerous. The Finance Commission as \nthe  main  arbiter  in  center-province  financial  relations  is  entrusted  with  overseeing  the \nimplementation of fiscal devolution. However, until recently, it met only occasionally, lacked \nfocused technical expertise (as four out of five budgeted positions were vacant), and had limited \naccountability to key stakeholders. Consequently, the FMRP supported appointing a full-time \nchairperson and secretary, filling the Finance Commission\u2019s vacancies, and vesting it with clear \nrules and procedures governing its responsibilities. \n \n95.  Since the appointment of a new chairperson of the Finance Commission, there has been \nsignificant progress in various areas. First, the Finance Commission has been restructured in \nline with a larger operating budget. In addition, a new Finance Commission Act is in preparation, \nsupported by the FMRP. Finally, a Committee for Capacity Building in Fiscal Devolution has \nbeen established and is meeting regularly to identify key recommendations under a United \nNations  Development  Programme  study  on  fiscal  decentralization  and  to  propose  that  the \nGovernment adopts these recommendations. \n \n96.  The Finance Commission is also responsible for defining the criteria for the set of central \ngovernment transfers to the PCs. Despite changing circumstances, the criteria have not been \nmodified since first introduced in 1989. Under the FMRP, the Finance Commission will review \nthe existing criteria and report on the appropriateness of the current arrangement based on \nprinciples of efficiency, transparency, simplicity, equity, and predictability. Criteria such as the \ndegree  of  provincial  fiscal  management\u2014to  better  realign  incentives\u2014and  poverty \nconsiderations\u2014to target poverty reduction and greater equity\u2014should be considered. \n \n97.  Another important step in the devolution of revenue and expenditure powers from the \ncenter to the provinces involves creating a more solid base for provincial revenues. Accordingly, \nthe FMRP recommends the identification of a defined tax that could either form the basis for the \ninitial source of central transfer to the PCs or alternatively result in the actual transfer of tax \ncollection responsibility to the PCs. \n \n98.  On the expenditure side, the PCs do not have full absorptive capacity to undertake the \nassigned expenditure provisions vested in them by the Constitution. In this context, the FMRP \nsupports the preparation of a time-bound implementation plan that will assess the capacity \nimprovements  needed  to  transfer  expenditure  responsibilities  in  selected  sectors  from  the \ncenter to the provinces, including education, health, and roads. \n  \n99.  Certainly, PCs will need to be subject to increased scrutiny and accountability as greater \nexpenditure and revenue powers are devolved to them. The FMRP will therefore call for a \nredressing of any potential imbalance between authority and accountability at the provincial \ngovernment  level,  through  the  publication  of  an  annual  performance  report  to  include \nachievements with regard to devolved revenue and expenditure powers as well as audited \nfinancial statements. \n ", "22 \n \n100.  Surprisingly, federal fiscal policy dialogue has been characterized by the absence of an \ninstitutional forum where government leaders from the two levels of government can discuss \ninterprovincial and center-provincial issues. This is an important missing link in the current \ninstitutional setup as in any federation, the process of coordination is as important as the \ncoordination  itself.  The  FMRP  will  support  the  convening  of  high-level  and  working-level \nmeetings to oversee and implement agreements reached. The following items could be part of \nthe agenda of these meetings: (i) Finance Commission recommendations, (ii) means to reduce \nvertical and horizontal imbalances, and (iii) proposals to remove overlapping of responsibilities \nbetween central and provincial governments. \n \n101.  Finally, and in recognition of the central Government\u2019s prerogative in determining the \npace of future devolution, the FMRP will support the preparation of studies that will provide the \nanalysis  and  technical  considerations  for  informed  decision-making.  The  first  study  would \nanalyze  the  scope  for  moving  toward  increased  devolution  of  capital  expenditures  to  the \nprovincial level. The fostering of provincial powers with regard to capital spending would, over \nthe  long  term,  assist  in  improving  income  generation  at  the  provincial  level  and  begin \naddressing  the  dependency  syndrome.  It  would  also  explore  the  scope  for  improved \nrealignment of incentives by moving gradually and, when recommended by the Government, \nfrom pure grant financing to loan financing, in line with increased capacity at the provincial level. \n \n102.  The second study would analyze ways to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of \ndecentralized expenditure and revenue assignments. As part of the integration of the various \nactivities under the FMRP, it would also seek to integrate the center-provinces\u2019 revenue sharing \ninto the medium-term budget programming and expenditure framework. Last, it would assess \nthe capacity building required to successfully accommodate greater fiscal decentralization and \naim to strengthen such capacity. \n \n4.  Financing Plan \n \n103.  It is proposed that ADB support the Government\u2019s policy reforms through a policy loan of \n$45 million. The borrower will be the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. The loan will \nbe from the OCR. The FMRP loan will have a 15-year repayment period including a grace \nperiod of 3 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility and a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum. (The \nfront-end fee of 1.0% is waived for public sector loans approved during 1 January 2004\u201330 June \n2005.) The Government will provide ADB with: (i) the reasons for the decision to borrow under \nADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions; and (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision, not made in reliance on any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. \n \n104.  The adjustment costs of the reforms under the FMRP are tentatively estimated at about \n$80 million and include the following: \n \n(i)  Restructuring  of  MOFP  including  staffing  enhancements  and  preparation  of \nannual audits of key ministries ($5 million); \n(ii)  MRA project including development of the electronic direct interface program, \nrecruitment of a CEO and additional advisors as per the new Revenue Board \nstructure,  implementation  of  reforms  under  the  FMRP,  and  expenditure  on \ntraining including consulting services ($30 million); \n(iii)  Government financing for the PAFMIS ($20 million); ", "  23\n \n(iv)  Government financing for the integrated aid MIS ($2 million); \n(v)  Procurement of customs container inspection equipment ($20 million); and \n(vi)  Staffing and institutional strengthening of the Finance Commission ($3 million). \n \n5.  Implementation Arrangements \n \na.  Program Management \n \n105.  MOFP will be the FMRP Executing Agency (EA). MOFP will set up an interagency \nimplementation and coordination committee (IICC) headed by the secretary to the treasury and \ncomprising representatives from the Fiscal Policy Department, National Budget Department, \nExternal Resource Department, National Planning Department, Public Enterprises Department, \nState Accounts Department, Revenue Board, CBSL, and Finance Commission. ADB will also be \na member of the IICC. The IICC will meet every quarter to monitor, coordinate, and ensure the \neffective implementation of the proposed reforms under the FMRP and will assist the EA in \nensuring successful completion of the FMRP. \n \nb.  Period of Implementation \n \n106.  The implementation period is 3 years and is to be completed by December 2007. \n \nc.  Procurement and Withdrawal Procedure \n \n107.  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange costs of items produced \nand procured in ADB member countries (other than items specified in the List of Ineligible Items \nincluded in Appendix 7) and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. The \nGovernment  will  certify  that  the  volume  of  eligible  imports  exceeds  the  amount  of  ADB\u2019s \nprojected  disbursements  under  the  loan  for  the  given  period.  It  is  expected  that  the  loan \nproceeds will be utilized over a period of 36 months from the date of loan effectiveness. ADB \nreserves  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  verify  the  accuracy  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s certification. Loan proceeds may be used to finance eligible imports for which \nexpenditures were incurred 180 days before the FMRP loan becomes effective. \n \nd.  Counterpart Funds \n \n108.  The Government will use the local currency funds generated by the FMRP loan to meet \nFMRP expenditures and associated costs of reform. \n \ne.  Monitoring and Tranching \n \n109.  The loan will be released in three equal tranches of $15 million each. The first tranche is \nto be disbursed upon loan effectiveness and government compliance with all prior actions under \nthe FMRP. The second and third tranches are expected to be released within 18 and 36 \nmonths, respectively, from the release of the first tranche, subject to satisfactory compliance \nwith second and third tranche release conditions, respectively. Both the Government and ADB \nwill regularly and closely monitor FMRP implementation. (See Appendix 4 for the list of tranche \nrelease conditions.) \n \nf.  Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n110.  The IICC will establish and maintain a program performance monitoring system that will \ninclude a database on the status of policy measures and program indicators based on the policy \nmatrix. This will be linked with the projects\u2019 performance management systems (para. 132). The \n ", "24 \nIICC will benefit from the wealth of experience accumulated by MOFP over the years with ADB \nand other development partners in project management. \n \ng.  Program Review  \n \n111.  The Government and ADB will conduct a comprehensive midterm review at the end of \nyear 2 to evaluate the progress of the reform measures and their impact on fiscal management. \nIn  addition,  ADB  will  also  monitor  implementation  through  periodic  reviews  and  progress \nreports. ADB will conduct annual reviews throughout the implementation period. These will \nassist in identifying further actions for continued improvements to fiscal management. \n \nC.  Project Loans  \n \n1.  Objectives \n \n112.  The first project loan, MRA, will promote the institutional strengthening of the three \nrevenue departments and the Finance Commission through the procurement of an integrated \nRAMIS and ancillary equipment, respectively. RAMIS will, in turn, link with the IT systems for \nfinancial management in the areas of treasury, payment, expenditure, and budget progamming. \nThe second project, Strengthening of the Fiscal Management Institutions, will provide capacity-\nbuilding  support  for  institutional  development,  including  that  required  to  implement  the \nModernization Program for the Revenue Administration (Appendix 6). This would comprise \npromoting  the  development  of  skills  and  know-how  of  officials  through  the  contracting  of \nexternal expertise and transfer of knowledge via training and workshops. (See Appendix 8 for a \ndescription of  RAMIS  and  Appendix  9  for  the  terms  of  reference  for  the  capacity-building \ncomponent of the project loan.) \n \n2.  Focus and Outputs \n \na.  Enhancing the Revenue Administration   \n \n113.  Automating the work place will be the driving force behind the modernization strategy of \nthe revenue administration for the three revenue departments. In particular, adopting a fully \nintegrated and comprehensive MIS will be critical to improve efficiency in revenue administration \nand by moving toward a script-less system with security checks rendering it less prone to \nabuse, and thereby assisting in rooting out circumspect practices of the past. The MRA project \nwill therefore contribute to integrating the tax data and information from each of the three \nrevenue departments and the BOI into a common platform. Accordingly, RAMIS aims to help \nthe  revenue  departments  develop  an  electronic  organization  system  (also  known  as  \u201ce-\norganization\u201d) and ensure that the standard is maintained on an ongoing basis. (See component \n2 under terms of reference for the capacity building component of the project loan in Appendix 9 \nfor a more detailed description.) \n \n114.  Assistance will also be provided for procurement of computer hardware and software for \nthe Finance Commission.  \n \nb.  Strengthening of the Fiscal Management Institutions \n \n115.  Institutional  development  of  the  revenue  departments  will  be  critical  for  effectively \nachieving the goals of the revenue modernization strategy. Foremost among the priorities will be \nthe transformation of the current cadre at the respective tax administrations into well-qualified ", "  25\n \nexperts. This will imply establishing a balance between acquiring specialized technical expertise \nthat  adapts  international  best  practices  to  the  requirements  of  the  modernized  revenue \ndepartments, on the one hand, and building expertise through training and working alongside \ninternational advisors including those seconded from successful revenue collection authorities \non the other (see component 3 under terms of reference for the capacity building component of \nthe project loan in Appendix 9 for a more detailed description). \n \n116.  Assistance will also be provided to support institutional development in the Finance \nCommission  with  emphasis  on  MIS,  including  integration  and  linkages  across  relevant \nassociated institutions, and on skills development. \n \n3.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan  \n \n117.  The total cost of the two projects is estimated at $33.4 million equivalent, including \ncontingencies and financing charges, comprising $22.4 million in foreign exchange costs and \n$11 million equivalent in local currency costs. A summary of cost estimates is given in Table 1.  \n \nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n \nForeign  Local  Total \nItem \nExchange  Currency  Cost \n       \nA.

The  two  project  loans  will  comprise:  (i) $15 million  from  OCR  for  the  MRA,  with  a \nmaturity period of 25 years including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, and a commitment charge of 0.75% per \nannum; 13 and (ii) SDR 6,672,000 ($10 million equivalent) from the Asian Development Fund \n(ADF) resources for Strengthening of the Fiscal Management Institutions and will have a 32-\nyear repayment period, including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1.0% \nduring the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. The borrower of the two project loans will be the \nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. The Government will provide ADB with (i) the \nreasons for the decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of \nthese terms and conditions; and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent \ndecision, and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The Government \nhas indicated that interest during construction will be capitalized. A financing plan for the two \nprojects is provided in Table 2 (see Supplementary Appendix 11 for the detailed financing plan). \n \n                                                 \n12 Includes interest during construction and commitment fees. \n13 Front-end fee of 1.0% is waived for public sector loans approved during 1 January 2004\u201330 June 2005. \n ", "26 \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \n  Foreign  Local  Total   \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost  Percentage\n         \nAsian Development Bank   22.4  2.6  25.0  75 \nGovernment of Sri Lanka  0.0  8.4  8.4  25 \n              Total  22.4  11.0  33.4  100 \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n4.  Implementation Arrangements \n \na.  Project Management \n \n119.  MOFP  will  oversee  and  coordinate  the  implementation  of  both  projects  through \ndelegation  to:  (i) the  IICC  headed  by  the  secretary  to  the  treasury  and  comprising  senior \nrepresentatives of the fiscal management institutions (see para. 105 for the composition of the \nIICC); and (ii) a project implementation unit (PIU) for the MRA project, headed by a project \nmanager (consultant) who will report jointly to the CEO of the Revenue Board and to the \nsecretary  to  the  treasury.  The  project  manager  will  have  the  authority  to  make  decisions \nessential to ensuring progress of the MRA project with regard to facilitating procurement of \nequipment, and will liaise closely with the management coordination team (para. 122 below) on \nthe recruitment of consulting services. The project manager will be assisted by a deputy project \nmanager funded by the Government. Coordination across the two projects will be ensured by \nthe IICC on administrative matters and by the Revenue Board on more substantive issues. The \nRevenue Board oversees the CEO\u2019s activities and many of its members are also members of \nthe IICC. The secretary to the treasury as head of the IICC and member of the Revenue Board \nwill have full information and reinforce coordination of the FMRP. The secretary to the treasury \nwill have the authority to make decisions essential to ensure progress of the projects with regard \nto facilitating procurement of equipment and recruitment of consulting services under the project \nloans. PIU will submit quarterly reports in compliance with international accounting practices \nand  will  ensure  internal  controls.  Activities  related  to  the  Strengthening  of  the  Fiscal \nManagement  Institutions  project  in  support  of  National  Budget  Department,  Fiscal  Policy \nDepartment, and State Accounts Department will fall under the responsibility of the respective \ndirectors general while those for the Finance Commission will fall under the responsibility of the \nchairperson of the Finance Commission. They are all members of the IICC. (See Appendix 10 \nfor an organizational chart on the coordination and implementation arrangements under FMRP.) \n \nb.  Period of Implementation \n \n120.  The  implementation  period  is  3  years  to  be  completed  by  December  2007.  (See \nAppendix 11 for the planned project implementation schedule.) \n \nc.  Procurement  \n \n121.  Under the MRA project, three procurement packages have been identified and are \noutlined in Appendix 12. Procurement of goods and services will be subject to the provisions of \nADB's  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Equipment  will  be  procured  through  international \ncompetitive bidding for package 1 on a turnkey basis and to include the purchase, installation, \ntesting, and training of the integrated RAMIS. Packages 2 and 3 will be procured under either ", "  27\n \ninternational  competitive  bidding  for  urgent  packages  not  exceeding  $100,000  or  direct \npurchase for urgent packages not exceeding $500,000 equivalent. Package 2 will support the \nprocurement  of  business  machines  and  office  equipment  for  the  Finance  Commission  to \ncomplement  United  Nations  Development  Programme-supported  MIS  systems  recently \nprocured to ensure prompt link-up of the Finance Commission with the provincial councils\u2019 \nfinance departments. Package 3 will support the procurement of business machines and office \nequipment for the newly created Revenue Board and other urgent requests in the revenue \ndepartments. ADB has approved advance action for procurement packages 2 and 3 to enable \nimmediate initiation of activities subsequent to loan effectiveness. The Government has been \nadvised that approval of advance action does not commit ADB to finance the project. \n \nd.  Consulting Services \n \n122.  The Strengthening of the Fiscal Management Institutions project loan will finance a total \nof 160 person-months of international and 270 person-months of domestic consulting services. \nAll international and domestic consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the \nengagement of domestic consultants. The Strengthening of the Fiscal Management Institutions \nproject will also hire a management coordination team to facilitate selection, recruitment, and \nmanagement of consulting services including the capacity-building and training components of \nthe project. The management coordination team will be provided by a firm through quality-based \nselection (QBS) and recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \nUp to 30% of the total costs of the consulting services under the Strengthening of the Fiscal \nManagement Institutions project are to be allocated for recruitment under QBS because (i) the \nassignment is critical as it affects a basic pillar of the economy, namely the Government\u2019s ability \nto generate revenue that not only affects its running but provides the basis for articulation of \ngovernment policies through its spending program; (ii) institutional constraints in Sri Lanka pose \nrisks for the favorable outcome of the FMRP and henceforth, quality-based consulting inputs, \nwhich  are  critical  in  capacity-building  initiatives  under  FMRP,  need  to  override  other \nconsiderations in selection of consulting firms; (iii) the assignments are complex and highly \nspecialized and process oriented, which does not allow the writing of very detailed terms of \nreference; and (iv) there is a high downstream impact and risk of program failure if the best \nconsultant is not selected. QBS will be used for recruitment of the head of the management \ncoordination team and head of PIU as well as revenue administration, human resources and IT \nspecialists,  and  an  actuarial  expert.  (See  Supplementary  Appendix  12  for  the  consulting \nservices selection criterion). \n \n123.  Separate  subcontracting  of  the  services  of  individual  consultants  or  firms  may  be \nrequired  for  other  components  of  the  Strengthening  of  the  Fiscal Management  Institutions \nproject. Consulting services for such other components will be provided through quality-and \ncost-based selection (QCBS) by one or more consulting firms or individual consultants recruited \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. In the case of selection of \nconsulting firms, simplified technical proposals will be used wherever suitable. The Government \nof  Sri  Lanka  has  reached  a  preliminary  agreement  with  the  Revenue  Department  of  the \nGovernment of Thailand to have officials from Thailand sent to impart training and advisory \nservices  to  Sri  Lanka.  The  recruitment  of  these  consultants  will  be  included  under  direct \nselection  as  part  of  the  overall  support  for  the  institutional  enhancements  of  the  revenue \nadministration in view of Thailand\u2019s recent transformation of its own revenue administration and \nunique  benefit  resulting  from  such  collaboration.  The  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  will  be \nresponsible for funding the deputy project manager, and various human resources and IT \n ", "28 \nspecialists, as well as selective revenue administration training courses both in country and \nabroad.14 All other funding of consultants will be financed by ADB. \n \n124.  The following components and illustrative activities are identified for financing under the \nStrengthening of the Fiscal Management Institutions project loan: \n \n(i)  Component 1: Project Implementation and Coordination \n \n(a)  The PIU under the leadership of the project manager will, \nin addition to its day-to-day oversight and implementation \nfunctions,  also  assist  in  overseeing  procurement  and \nconsulting services inputs pertaining to the MRA project in \ncoordination with the IICC. There will be close coordination \nbetween the PIU project manager and the head of the \nmanagement  coordination  team  including  (i) design  of \nterms  of  reference,  (ii) selection  of  consultants, \n(iii) identification  of  necessary  expertise  to  ensure \nsuccessful  project  implementation,  (iv) supervision  of \nconsultants, and (v) quality control based on evaluation of \nconsultants\u2019  inputs  and  reports.  Coordination  will  be  in \nclose  liaison  with  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  PIU \nproject  manager  will  also  regularly  assess  performance \nand effectiveness of capacity-building inputs in support of \nthe MRA project. \n \n(b)  The management coordination team will assist in designing \nterms  of  reference  and  facilitating  recruitment  in  close \nliaison with the PIU project manager, the Government, and \nADB, managing the consultants and reporting performance \nand effectiveness of capacity-building inputs in support of \nproject-related  activities.  The  head  of  the  management \ncoordination  team  will  have  overall  responsibility  for \nadministrative issues on the capacity-building component \nand technical oversight other than in the modernizing of \nthe revenue administration component below. She or he \nwill  liaise  with  the  PIU  project  manager  on  all  matters \nrelated to the modernizing of the revenue administration \ncomponent below. \n \n(ii)  Component  2: Modernizing of the Revenue Administration.  \n  This component will support the implementation of the Modernization of \nRevenue Administration project (as identified in Appendix 6, task list for \nthe modernization program of the revenue administration). \n \n(iii)  Component  3:  Fiscal  Management  Institutions  (non-MRA). \nThis component will support effective implementation of the policy actions \nidentified in the Program and will include: \n \n                                                 \n14 The Government will obtain ADB concurrence on consultant selection under government funding.

ADB has approved advanced actions for component 1 to enable immediate initiation of \nactivities subsequent to loan effectiveness. \n \ne.  Disbursement Arrangements  \n \n126.  CBSL on behalf of the Borrower will open within 1 month of loan effectiveness, two \nimprest accounts denominated in dollars, one for each of the project loans and managed by \nMOFP (the EA). The imprest accounts will be operated and maintained in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Handbook on Loan Disbursements dated January 2001. ADB will advance 3 months of \nestimated expenditures (about $1.5 million) into the imprest accounts for each of the loans. \nForeign exchange payments or letters of credit, as well as local currency expenditures, may be \npaid out of the imprest accounts. The ADB statement of expenditures procedure will be used to \nliquidate and replenish the imprest accounts for individual payments not exceeding $50,000. \n \n127.  The EA will maintain separate records and accounts, adequate to identify goods and \nservices financed out of the loan proceeds. Auditors acceptable to ADB will audit such accounts \nand records annually. \n \nf.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n128.  An audit of the use of the loan proceeds will be undertaken and ADB retains the right to \n(i) audit any account, and (ii) verify the validity of the certification issued by the Government for \neach withdrawal application. Prior to withdrawal, the Government will open an account at CBSL \nto  receive  all  loan  proceeds.  The  account  will  be  managed,  operated,  and  liquidated  in \naccordance with terms satisfactory to ADB. The IICC and the PIU will send quarterly progress \nreports to ADB on project implementation. \n \n129.  The Government will maintain records and accounts for the imprest funds and project \nexpenditure in accordance with sound accounting principles and will have such accounts and \nrecords audited annually by auditors acceptable to ADB. The Government will ensure that the \nsubmission of project reports, audited accounts, and financial statements are in compliance with \n ", "30 \nADB's guidelines. Certified copies of the audit reports together with the auditors\u2019 opinion will be \nsubmitted to the Government and ADB not more than 6 months after the close of financial year. \nThe  audit  reports  will  include  a  separate  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and \nstatement of expenditures procedures. \n \n130.  Each  component  of  the  projects  will  be  implemented  in  three  phases.  During  the \ninception phase, the consultants of the various components will revalidate the objectives and \nassess priorities, key issues, and capacity-building needs. At the end of this phase, resource \ninputs may be adjusted, as appropriate, within the overall budget and project scope, to better \nalign the terms of reference, activities, and outputs with client expectations and needs. During \nthe design phase, the consultants will formulate in detail the capacity-building and operational \ndevelopment plans. Finally, in the implementation phase, the consultants will document required \nregulations, procedures, and systems, as well as arrange for training and skills development, as \nappropriate. \n \n131.  The consultants for each component will prepare an inception report within 2 months of \nthe start of their services, which will fine-tune and detail the work program and establish time-\nbound outputs. A first review report will be submitted at the end of 6 months, a second review \nreport at the end of 12 months, an interim report at the end of 24 months, and a draft final report \nincluding complete documentation at the end of 30 months, with the submission of the final \nreport  at  the  end  of  the  assignment  after  incorporation  of  comments  of  ADB  and  the \nGovernment. \n \n132.  The PIU will submit quarterly reports on the two projects to ADB within 1 month of the \nend of each quarter in accordance with ADB\u2019s program performance management system \n(PPMS) guidelines. The reports will contain a narrative description of progress made during the \nperiod, changes to the implementation schedule if any, problems or difficulties encountered and \nthe remedial actions taken, the performance of the project consultants where applicable, and \nthe work to be carried in the upcoming period. The reports will also include a summary financial \naccount for the two projects, consisting of the projects\u2019 expenditures to date. Project completion \nreports will be submitted to ADB within 3 months of the completion of the projects. \n \n  g.   Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n133.  In addition to regular and ongoing interaction among the EA, ADB, and its consultants, \nthe Government and ADB will periodically review project implementation based on quarterly \nreports of the PIU and consultant reports. The reviews will include evaluation of project scope, \nimplementation arrangements, consultations with MOFP and PIU, and progress with the policy \nreform  agenda  and  capacity-building  measures.  On  an  annual  basis  or  more  frequently  if \nwarranted, the EA will submit a report to ADB on the overall assessment of the quality of inputs. \n \nh.  Project Reviews  \n \n134.  The Government and ADB will periodically review project implementation. The reviews \nwill include evaluation of the project scope, implementation arrangements, consultation with EA \nand PIU, and progress with the policy reform agenda and capacity-building measures. ADB will \nalso field regular review missions, including midterm, and project completion review missions. A \ncomprehensive midterm review at the end of year 2 will be undertaken to evaluate actual physical \nand financial progress. Based on this review, modifications and improvements will be considered. \n \n ", "  31\n \nV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits \n \n135.  The proposed FMRP is expected to address constraints highlighted under Section III by \nstrengthening public finances including improving public resource and expenditure management \nsystems, promoting fiscal discipline, and supporting fiscal decentralization. The FMRP will help \nestablish  a  well-functioning,  coordinated,  and  semiautonomous  revenue  administration \ncomprising inland revenue, customs and excise departments, which would be responsible for all \naspects of revenue collection. As part of automation of the revenue administration, the FMRP \nwill  also  contribute  toward  e-government.  The  FMRP  will  also  help  streamline  budgeting \nprocedures and expenditure control processes within MOFP. As part of this reform agenda, the \nFMRP will assist in reorienting budget management from a compliance-based system to one \nincorporating elements of results-based budgeting. Fiscal discipline will be strengthened under \nthe  FMRP  through  measures  to  increase  transparency  and  accountability  and  based  on \nlegislative and rules-based reporting requirements. Finally, support for fiscal decentralization will \ninclude  measures  to  reduce  the  overlap  of  public  expenditure  functions  across  levels  of \ngovernment  as  well  as  other  reforms  to  improve  funding  and  effectiveness  of  devolved \nassignments. These measures are expected to support the implementation of the Government\u2019s \nfiscal  strategy,  emphasizing  fiscal  consolidation  compatible  with  medium-term  fiscal \nsustainability, and to improve fiscal performance. \n \n136.  The MRA project will focus on the procurement of the RAMIS and ancillary equipment to \nassist in the creation of the MRA and thereby ensure a prompt and smooth transformation of the \nrevenue administration. Under the Strengthening of the Fiscal Management Institutions project, \nsupport will be provided to, among others, carrying out the activities on the task list for the \nmodernization  program  of  the  revenue  administration,  thereby  complementing  the  RAMIS \nautomation process. In addition, implementation plans have been prepared on strategic inputs \nto  support  a  well-running  revenue  administration  including  organization  and  management, \nhuman resources and training, and IT. The equipment procured under the project loan will \nprovide the necessary infrastructure to facilitate efficiency and effectiveness of tax collection \nand compliance. \n \n137.  The  non-MRA  capacity-building  components  under  the  Strengthening  of  the  Fiscal \nManagement Institutions project will support the implementation of the reform program under \nFMRP. As part of this assistance, training activities as well as highly specialized consulting \nservices  will  be  financed  to  improve  the  effective  operations  of  the  fiscal  management \ninstitutions. While some activities under the capacity-building component have been identified, \nothers have yet to be defined, thereby providing greater flexibility for the Government to manage \nresources under this project loan. The project loans will therefore serve to (i) strengthen the \nrevenue  administration  and  other  fiscal  management  institutions  and,  ultimately,  improve \ncompliance with fiscal objectives; and (ii) help mitigate risks, particularly in the setting up the \nmodernization  of  revenue  administration  and  thereby  ensure  successful  program \nimplementation. \n \nB.  Impacts \n \n138.  The FMRP will seek to strengthen public finances, focusing on improving the budget \nframework and expenditure control measures while enhancing revenue mobilization efforts. \nDirect beneficiaries will include business at large who, despite paying higher taxes on average \n(as loopholes are closed and effective compliance strengthened) over the medium term, will \n ", "32 \nbenefit from a clearer, simplified, and more balanced tax and customs administration. Under the \nGovernment\u2019s  reform  program,  fiscal  consolidation  may  result  in  cutbacks  on  current \nexpenditures in the social sector, which may affect the poor. However, these cutbacks will be \noffset  by  measures  to  increase  the  effectiveness  of  these  expenditures  and  by  outright \nincreases in capital expenditures in the social sector that over the medium term more than offset \nthe current expenditure cutbacks, in relative terms. \n \n139.  On the positive side, the FMRP will strengthen macroeconomic stabilization by reducing \nthe country\u2019s imbalances, thereby supporting higher and more sustainable growth prospects. \nThis is expected to contribute to poverty reduction. In addition, under the FMRP, measures to \nstrengthen  fiscal  decentralization  and  performance  monitoring  would  also  target  the  social \nsector spending agencies thereby providing greater effectiveness of spending assignments, \nespecially for those segments of the population that are more reliant on public goods and \nservices.  Finally,  under  the  envisaged  reforms  to  intergovernment  transfer  setting,  equity \nconsiderations and, in particular, poverty incidence will be given greater prominence, thereby \nsupporting poverty reduction. (See Appendix 13 for the summary poverty reduction and social \nstrategy.) \n \n140.  FMRP is classified as category C under ADB\u2019s environmental classification system. The \nFMRP is expected to have no direct environmental impact. \n \nC.  Risks  \n \n141.  There  are  multiple  risks  to  the  successful  implementation  of  the  FMRP.  Foremost, \nconsolidation of the peace process and political stability will be critical for the Government to \noversee meaningful economic reforms. Fiscal consolidation efforts, in particular, will require \nstrong  government  commitment  and  any  slippages  on  the  security  or  political  fronts  may \nweaken  the  Government\u2019s  resolve.  Although  limited  disbursements  were  realized  in  2004, \nresources committed at the June 2003 Tokyo Donor Conference, subject to progress in peace \ntalks, should facilitate the fiscal consolidation process.  \n \n142.  On the economic front, exogenous shocks to the economy could potentially impair the \nGovernment\u2019s ability for aggressive fiscal consolidation. Current high oil prices have weighed \nheavily  on  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  stabilization  efforts  and  in  particular  on  the  balance  of  payments. \nFurthermore, attempts to cushion the effect of high oil prices on domestic users have indeed \nadded  further  pressure  on  the  fiscal  balance.  As  fiscal  consolidation  leads  to  improved \nmacroeconomic  stabilization  and  greater  flexibility  to  cope  with  these  shocks,  there  is  a \nreinforcing link between the deepening of reforms and ability to cope with these shocks. \n \n143.  Other risks include the power of vested interests that could attempt to block reforms. The \ngreatest risk here comes from trade unions, which may successfully mobilize public opinion (i.e., \nthrough strikes and other industrial action) in a manner so as to dilute the reforms, potentially \nproving  detrimental  to  the  FMRP\u2019s  objectives.  There  are  also  institutional  risks  given  the \nrelatively  overstretched  resources  in  key  ministries  and  revenue  administration.  These, \ncombined with the comprehensive nature of the FMRP and the close links with political risks, \nmay slow implementation of the FMRP. \n \n144.  Safeguards include the \u201cadditionality\u201d of a continuing and constructive policy dialogue \nbetween the Government and IMF on conducive fiscal consolidation and stabilization-based \nmacroeconomic policies. In addition, supporting project loans will mitigate risks through the \nincreased supply of resources\u2014including consulting services, equipment and training\u2014which ", "  33\n \nshould help overcome institutional constraints and facilitate program implementation. For this \nreason, close coordination between ADB and the Government is of fundamental importance \nespecially with respect to close monitoring of FMRP and of consultants\u2019 performance. ADB\u2019s \nproposed Private Sector and Financial Markets Development and the ongoing Power Sector \nDevelopment  programs15  will  also  reinforce  measures  such  as  improving  governance  in \ncommercial public enterprises, power sector restructuring, and cost recovery in electricity tariffs, \nthereby  reducing  pressures  on  state  budget.  (See  Appendix  14  for  the  development \ncoordination matrix.) \n \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n145.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given assurances that \n(i) the policies adopted and actions taken prior to the date of the Program Loan Agreement and \nProject Loan Agreements, as described in the Development Policy Letter, will continue in effect \nfor the duration of the FMRP; and (ii) it will promptly adopt the other policies and take the other \nactions  included  in  the  FMRP  as  specified  in  the  Development  Policy  Letter  and  Loan \nAgreement to ensure that such policies and actions continue in effect for the duration of the \nFMRP. \n \n146.

Introduction \n \n1.  In  June  2004,  the  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  introduced  its  new  Economic  Policy \nFramework. As part of the framework a revised medium-term fiscal program and strategy for \n2004\u20132007 was launched. \n \n2.  Four challenges are identified in the Economic Policy Framework, namely: (i) increasing \nemployment, (ii) overcoming the public debt crisis, (iii) mobilizing resources for reconstruction, \nand (iv) increasing income levels. To meet these challenges, the Government has prepared a \nMedium-Term  Macro  Fiscal  Policy  Framework  (MFPF)  2005\u20132008  submitted  with  the  2005 \nBudget to Parliament on 18 November 2004. Salient features of the MFPF include: (i) continued \nincrease in annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate from 6% in 2005 to 7.5% by 2008, \n(ii) a decrease of the GDP deflator from 8% in 2005 to 4.5% in 2008, (iii) a consecutive increase \nof total investment from 28% of GDP in 2005 to 34% in 2008, (iv) a consecutive increase of \nnational saving from 23.3% of GDP in 2005 to 30.8% in 2008, (v) a reduction in overall budget \ndeficit from 7.6% of GDP in 2005 to 4.4% in 2008, (vi) an improvement in the revenue balance \nfrom a deficit of 1.3% of GDP in 2005 to a surplus of 3.6% of GDP by 2008, and (vii) a decrease \nin  total  government  debt  from  103.9%  of  GDP  in  2005  to  93.5%  in  2008  (Supplementary \nAppendix 5). \n \n3.  Fiscal reforms constitute a key element under the medium-term macroeconomic policy \naction plans. The fiscal program in this medium-term strategy aims to restore fiscal sustainability \nand concurrently make available adequate resources for (i) priority spending on pro-growth \ncapital and social spending, and (ii) post-conflict needs. The following section describes the \nmedium-term fiscal measures under this medium-term strategy. \n \nB.  Medium-Term Fiscal Program \n \n4.  In view of the importance of creating fiscal space and significantly reducing large fiscal \ndeficits  and  public  debt,  the  Government  has  embarked  on  fiscal  consolidation  aiming  at \n(i) generating higher revenue; (ii) reducing current expenditure in order to enable higher capital \nexpenditure; and (iii) reducing demand on state resources by controlling leakages resulting from \nlending and transfers to public enterprises, contingent liabilities, and high debt service cost. \n \n1.  Revenue \n \n5.  Under the MFPF, total revenue as a percentage of GDP will increase by 3.9 percentage \npoints from an estimated 15.6% in 2004 to 19.5% in 2008. This comprises an increase in tax \nrevenues from 14.1% of GDP in 2004 to 17.7% in 2008 driven by increases in value-added tax \n(VAT) collection, which accounts for approximately 41% of total tax revenue. VAT including \neconomic service charge is targeted to increase from 5.9% of GDP in 2004 to 7.7% of GDP in \n2008, an increase of 1.8 percentage points. Excise taxes accounting for approximately 23% of \ntotal revenue are targeted to keep constant at approximately 3.2% of GDP in 2004 through to \n2008.  Income  tax,  accounting  for  approximately  15%  of  total  tax  revenue,  is  expected  to \ngenerate a more moderate increase of up to 0.9 percentage points from 2.2% of GDP in 2004 to \n3.1% in 2008. On nontax revenue, there will be a small increase from 1.5% of GDP in 2004 to \n1.9% of GDP in 2008 as there will be minor contributions from privatization proceeds. The \nincrease in nontax revenues will reflect increasing contributions from strategic enterprises by \nway of profit and dividend and the impact of cost recovery on state enterprises. The main ", "36 Appendix 1 \nsources of nontax revenue in the past have been profits from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and \ninterest payments on government lending. The former accounts for approximately 30% of total \nnontax revenue, and the latter for approximately 20%.  \n \n6.  Key  elements  in  support  of  revenue  augmentation  measures  include  (i) tax \nadministration, (ii) tax policy, and (iii) tax legislation. The tax administration measures essentially \ncomprise  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-supported  Modernization  of  the  Revenue \nAdministration project described in the main text. On tax policy, measures will target: (i) a \nbroadening of the tax base including the major achievement of integrating civil servants under \nthe pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) tax; (ii) increasing the number of VAT and customs duty bands as \nwell as their rates; (iii) introducing the turnover tax; (iv) implementing a simplified tax code; and \n(v) introducing a tightening of existing deductions on corporate taxes. On tax legislation, the \nonus will be on providing clear legislation that closes loopholes in tax laws and that phases out \nthe myriad of tax concessions. A significant reform submitted under the 2005 Budget includes \nimproving the powers of the revenue administration by introducing dedicated tax courts to deal \nwith recovery and other tax administration disputes. The tax legislation will also be amended to \nprovide the authority to the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue advanced rulings that are \nbinding in law. \n \n2.  Expenditure \n \n7.  On the expenditure front, the Government plans to reduce current expenditures mainly \nthrough:  (i)  a  significant  reduction  in  subsidies  and  transfers  to  households  and  public \nenterprises; (ii) cutbacks in interest payments and defense spending; and (iii) prioritizing public \nexpenditure1 while increasing capital spending on rural infrastructure facilities. From 2003 to \n2007, the Government plans to contain total expenditure to just below 24% of GDP by 2008. \nThis comprises a reduction in recurrent expenditure from 19.3% of GDP in 2004 to 15.9% in \n2008. However, capital expenditure is set to increase by 2.9 percentage points from 5% in 2004 \nto 7.9% in 2008. Debt service payments are targeted to decline from 11.7% of GDP in 2004 to \n7.5%  in  2008  reflecting  the  expected  lower  interest  rate  environment  and  improved  debt \nmanagement operations. Government subsidies and transfers which in 2004 are projected to \naccount  for  a  record,  21%  of  total  expenditures\u2014due  to  oil  price  subsidies  and  drought \nassistance relief\u2014are expected to decline to 16% of total expenditures in 2005. In relation to \nGDP, Government subsidies and transfers will decline from 5.1% in 2004 to 3.8% by 2008. The \nGovernment has announced plans for 2005 to convert SLRs90 billion of loans (with an average \nrate of interest of 11\u201313%) to non-convertible, lower interest rate bonds. Accordingly, interest \npayments will decline from 6% of GDP in 2004 to 5.6% in 2005 and onwards to 4.5% by 2008. \nThe Government is also committed to streamlining defense spending which is projected to \ndecline marginally from 3.5% of GDP in 2004 to 3.2% in 2008, subject to the continuation of the \neffective  cease-fire  and  ensuing  peace  process.  On  public  expenditure  prioritization,  the \nGovernment  has  identified  various  measures  including  (i) deepening  expenditure  control \nmeasures supported by the FMRP, (ii) strengthening accounting and auditing standards, and \n(iii) introducing improved practices in procurement management. These are expected to reduce \nsignificant wasteful expenditure.  \n \n8.  The reductions in recurrent expenditure are projected to be partially offset by increases \nin  capital  expenditure  largely  reflecting  the  positive  externalities  from  a  targeted  focus  on \nreconstruction of the north and northeast. The underlying strategy on capital expenditure is for \n                                                 \n1  Nearly 20% of the Government\u2019s current expenditures are used for transfers to households, similar to patterns \nobserved in upper-income Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development nations. ", "  Appendix 1  37 \nthe Government to absorb the maximum available foreign concessional investment, and by \nputting in place measures to improve monitoring of incoming development assistance and \nstrengthened links with the budget to increase the disbursement rate of concessional borrowing.  \n \n3.  Public Enterprises \n \n9.  There are more than 150 statutory boards and fully owned government companies and \nat least 40 commercial companies under partial government shareholding. Failure to restructure \nand introduce timely cost-recovery pricing will increase the deficits and resulting quasi-fiscal \ndrainage of resources from the budget. To contain further pressure on the state budget caused \nby public enterprise operations,2 the Government is addressing inefficient operations of public \nenterprises through comprehensive restructuring programs of 12 key public sector undertakings. \n \n10.  The  Strategic  Enterprises  Management  Authority  (SEMA)  was  created  by  the \nGovernment  shortly  upon  assuming  office  with  the  objective  to  manage  as  independent \nenterprises 12 strategic enterprises\u2014with combined assets in excess of $10.5 billion. A key \nelement will be to improve profitability and accordingly restructuring plans have been approved \nby SEMA and the respective board of directors, which were submitted for cabinet approval in \nlate October 2004. As far as the impact on the budget is concerned, the restructuring plans \ncontain strict budget ceilings to reduce the strategic enterprises' impact on public finances and \nto prevent losses of the strategic enterprises from being financed through state-owned banks.  \n \n11.  The results from the restructuring plans should lay the foundations for increases in \nnontax revenue remittances from public enterprises, reduction of accumulated tax arrears, and \nreduced subsidies and guarantees to public enterprises. The last point is particularly of a \ngreater concern due to the existing subsidies and other contingent liabilities supported by the \nGovernment under its direct transfer and lending program to public enterprises and institutions. \n \n4.  Public Debt Management  \n \n12.  To reduce the debt service cost, the Government has introduced measures to control \ninterest payments by refraining from using expensive domestic borrowing (such as overdraft \nfacilities),  smoothing  the  debt  amortization  schedule,  and  issuing  longer-term  debt.  The \nGovernment  is  also  assessing  the  merits  of  establishing  an  independent  public  debt \nmanagement office at the Ministry of Finance to steward debt management reforms. \n \n13.  Interest payment on government debt peaked at 7.5% of GDP in 2003, and according to \nthe Economic Policy Framework is projected to gradually decline to 5% in 2007 as the primary \ndeficit moves into balance. Interest payment, which accounted for 35% of current expenditure in \n2003,  was  the  largest  item  of  current  expenditure.  This  reflected  a  combination  of  the \naccumulation  of  high-cost  domestic  debt  together  with  constraints  to  debt  management \nincluding limitations on including a callable option on issued debt. In particular, the Government \ncontinued to expand budget deficits throughout the late 1990s and early 2000 despite a shortfall \nin financing sources. Consequently, the interest rate was pushed up to 20\u201322% between late \n2000 and mid-20013 due to persistently high fiscal deficits. Furthermore, large amortizations, \n                                                 \n2 The Government provided an estimated capital injection of $166 million for five strategic public enterprises in 2003 \nand another $113 million is estimated for 2004. \n3  Weighted average of bank prime lending rates. ", "38 Appendix 1 \nreflecting a past overconcentration of rolled over short-term debt issuance in 1999 and 2000, fell \ndue in 2002 (and 2003)4 adding greater fiscal stress in the form of larger debt-servicing costs. \n \n14.  In 2002, the Government replaced high-cost overdrafts with marketable debt instruments \nsuch as treasury bills and treasury bonds. As a result, the outstanding overdraft was reduced \nfrom SRs38 billion (12% of current liabilities) at end-2001 to SRs3.6 billion (2% of current \nliabilities) at end-2002. This measure not only lowered the interest cost but also reduced the \npressure on government cash flow. This effort will need to be further consolidated over the \ncoming years. \n \n                                                 \n4  According to the government accounts reported in CBSL Annual Report 2002, total amortization payments (both \ndomestic and foreign) are SRs167,843 million and SRs187,754 million in 2002 and 2003, respectively, compared \nwith total revenue of SRs270,763 million and SRs316,223 million in 2002 and 2003, respectively. \n ", "  Appendix 2  39 \nFISCAL OBJECTIVES AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE FISCAL  \nMANAGEMENT (RESPONSIBILITY) ACT \n \nTable A2.1: Fiscal Objectives under the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act \n \nCriteria  Objective  Timing \n(% of GDP) \n1.

The current information technology (IT) systems in the departments are 8\u201310 years old \nand  were  developed  in  an  independent  fashion  with  no  view  to  integration.  The  Revenue \nAdministration Management Information System (RAMIS) is now proposed to fully integrate and \ncomprehensively cover the use of information and communications technology (ICT) to improve \nrevenue mobilization in Sri Lanka. The fully integrated and comprehensive RAMIS will help the \nthree revenue departments\u2014Inland Revenue Department (IRD), Customs Department (CD), and \nExcise Department (ED)\u2014in enhancing effectiveness, efficiency, and transparency of revenue \nadministration through the use of new technology. RAMIS aims to help the revenue departments \ndevelop an electronic organization system (also known as \u2018e-organization\u2019) and ensure that the \nstandard is maintained on an ongoing basis. RAMIS will also provide secure, efficient, and \nresponsive systems for the users in the departments and for the clients of the departments. In \nother words, RAMIS will also promote voluntary compliance among taxpayers through, among \nothers, wide information dissemination modes and a fully integrated one-stop shop for taxpayers. \nThe integrated RAMIS will lay down synergies in revenue administration across departments, \nwhich in turn should enable tax collectors to cross-check tax information within and across \ndepartments. \n2.  The tax data and information from each of the three revenue departments and the Board \nof Investment (BOI) will be integrated in a common platform. These data and information include \nregistration information, taxpayer accounting, and tax identity numbers. Selected information \nfrom the common platform will be available to authorized tax officials in each of the three \nrevenue departments. (See the flow chart on information flow under RAMIS below.) A master \nplan will be developed to determine what functions are common and which are unique to each \ndepartment, and it will identify a prioritized plan for development. During the reengineering \nprocess, the systems requirements will be clearly defined. Existing systems were built based on \nprocesses  available  at  the  time  and  are  as  inefficient  as  the  processes  themselves.  The \nfunctionality of all systems must be expanded and in the case of the core systems, all tax types \nshould be included. \n  Figure A7: Revenue Administration Management Information System \n \n     Common Platform\nTreasur y (Public  Finance \nAccounting And Financial     Registration Information  Commission/ \n  MIS)     Taxpayer Accounting  Provincial Council\n    Taxpayer Identification      \n  Inland Revenue Dept     Number \n  Large Taxpayer Unit  BOI \n  System \n  Customs Dept\nVAT, Income Taxes, etc. \n \n  ASYCUDA/EDI Excise Dept \nTax \n \nIdentification \n  Number  Customs Duties \n  VAT on Imports  Excise Tax \nExcises on \n \nImports, Etc. \n  Banks \n \nASYCUDA = Automated System for Customs Data, BOI = Board of Investment, EDI = Electronic Direct Interface,  \nMIS = management information system, VAT = value-added tax. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n ", "  Appendix 8  65 \n3.  In each of the three departments, a modernization unit will be established to spearhead \nrevenue modernization and mobilization reforms. The Revenue Modernization Unit (RMU) to be \nestablished in IRD will design and implement the reforms such as maintenance of tax systems, \ndata entry of tax returns, hardware, and network support. The Customs Modernization Unit \n(CMU)  to  be  established  in  CD  will  support  the  Automated  System  for  Customs  Data \n(ASYCUDA) system, hardware, and network support, and develop and support cargo control \nsystems.  The  Excise  Modernization  Unit  (EMU)  will  be  established  in  ED  will  design  and \nimplement the administrative reforms of excise tax collection.  \n4.  While seeking to introduce the new comprehensive and integrated ICT system, the \nRAMIS  will  maintain  and  update  the  existing  systems  used  in  each  of  the  three  revenue \ndepartments.  The  major  existing  IT  systems  include  the  ASYCUDA  and  Electronic  Direct \nInterface (EDI) in the CD. Apart from the ASYCUDA system within CD, the existing IT systems \nprovide a very limited range of support for revenue administration. Within the IRD there are \nseparate systems to process and account for tax returns and payments for different types of \ntaxes. It is not possible to obtain a clear indication of a taxpayer\u2019s account with regard to the \ntaxes within the tax administration that it controls. Therefore, it is also not possible to obtain \ncritical information needed for auditing the status of the taxpayer who deals with all three \nrevenue departments. In addition to the stand-alone IT systems, much important tax information \nis not entered into the system at all. For example, all import value-added tax information is \ntransferred from CD to IRD in an ad hoc fashion without being systematically entered into the IT \nsystems of the two departments. \n \n ", " 66 Appendix 9 \nTERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE STRENGTHENING OF THE FISCAL MANAGEMENT \nINSTITUTIONS PROJECT  \n \nA.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n   \nSector identified as a national priority in country  Sector identified as a national priority in \npoverty analysis? Yes  country poverty partnership agreement? Yes \n   \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Sri Lanka:  \n \nThe Fiscal Management Reform Program (FMRP) contributes to poverty reduction through promoting \ngood  governance  by  improving  effectiveness  of  tax  administration,  budget  framework,  expenditure \nmanagement control systems, fiscal discipline, and fiscal decentralization framework. The FMRP will \nstrengthen macroeconomic stabilization by reducing the country\u2019s imbalances, thereby supporting higher \nand more sustainable growth prospects. The lower the budget deficit is, the less intense the competition \nfor resources between public and private sector, thereby reducing the price of borrowing, i.e., the interest \nrate. The private sector can obtain more resources at lower cost to expand investment and production. \nThrough a better accessibility to such resources, the private sector can actively and efficiently generate \neconomic growth and provide employment opportunities for the poor. This is expected to contribute to \npoverty  alleviation.  In  addition,  various  activities  such  as  fiscal  decentralization  and  performance \nmonitoring should provide greater effectiveness of spending assignments, especially for those segments \nof the population that are more reliant on public goods and services. Finally, the review of intergovernment \ntransfers under the fiscal decentralization component of the FMRP should result in a revised formula that \nprovides greater emphasis on equity considerations such as income per capita. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis         Targeting Classification:    General Intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nWith no reforms, not only the poor of the present generation will increasingly suffer from declining access \nto public goods and services but also the poor of future generations due to the resulting transfer of the \nlarge and uncontained debt burden. The FMRP assists the Government in the area of fiscal consolidation \nand structural reforms. Under the Government\u2019s reform program, fiscal consolidation, resulting in cutbacks \non recurrent expenditures in the social sector, may affect the poor in the short run. However, measures to \nincrease the effectiveness of these expenditures and outright increases in capital expenditures in the \nsocial sector more than offset the current expenditure cutbacks over the medium term. In addition, the \nGovernment is committed to protecting public spending on services most important to the poor and indeed \nhaving public spending better focused on the needs of the poor. Fiscal consolidation is critical in order for \nthe Government to overcome the serious problem of public debt crisis.  \n \n  Under the FMRP, from the revenue side, cutting down on tax exemptions combined with the \nremoval of economic distortions arising from an uneven tax system is expected to generate greater fiscal \nrevenues. On the expenditure side, the FMRP will support the improved efficiency of public spending and \ngreater public savings through: (i) restructuring efforts of departments, (ii) removal of duplication across \ngovernments and ministries, and (iii) greater transparency in the use of funds including special funds. The \nrestructuring efforts may lead to some labor shedding, however this should be offset by more effective use \nof expenditures and social transfers. \n \n  In  line  with  fiscal  consolidation  efforts  supported  by  the  FMRP  and  overall  improved \nmacroeconomic stabilization, the gross domestic product (GDP) growth outlook under the government \neconomic development strategy is estimated to increase to 6.4% per annum over the medium term. This is \nexpected to increase income per capita from $838 in 2001 to $940 in 2007. Similarly, inflation, a tax falling \ndisproportionately on the poor, is projected to decline from 6.3% in 2003 to 5% in 2007. More importantly, \nunemployment is forecast to fall from 8.4% in 2003 to an estimated 7% in 2007. \n \n \n \n ", "76  Appendix 13 \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No    \nStakeholder analysis: A poverty reduction strategy developed over the years 1999\u20132002, which provides a \nfoundation for the designing of the reform program, sought widespread participation and consultation with \nstakeholders and interest groups. The Government has undertaken extensive stakeholder consultation in \nthe elaboration of the 2005 budget.

In assisting the Government in strengthening public finances, the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) and other development partners have provided relevant technical and financial \nassistance.  ADB  has  provided  technical  assistance  including  (i)  Public  Expenditure \nManagement Systems (PEMS)1, and (ii) Public Sector Resource Management (PSRM).2 The \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) has provided policy recommendations to achieve overall \nmacroeconomic stability including fiscal stability through the Poverty Reduction and Growth \nFacility-Extended Fund Facility (PRGF-EFF) arrangements to stabilize foreign reserves. World \nBank  has  provided  assistances  in,  among  other  things,  Country  Financial  Accountability \nAssessment (CFAA) study and will provide technical assistance in public expenditure review \nand  public  debt  management.  Other  assistance  includes  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme (UNDP) support for management information system (MIS) linkup between Finance \nCommission (FC) and Provincial Councils (PCs) and United States (US) Treasury Department \nsupport for budget operations (see Figure A.14 Structure of Reforms and Coordination). \n \nB.  Asian Development Bank Technical Assistance \n \n2.  PEMS  has  strengthened  the  preparation  of  the  budget  by  introducing  means  to \nstrengthen  planning  and  programming  including  greater  integration  between  the  fiscal  and \nbudget departments. It has also strengthened expenditure controls resulting from the PEMS\u2019 \nprior work on budget classification. The budget monitoring system has also been strengthened \nby introducing, on a pilot basis, elements of performance monitoring in land transport. \n \n3.  PSRM had been setting the groundwork for the creation of the Sri Lanka Revenue \nAuthority (SLRA). In view of the change in policy thrust following the elections in April 2004, an \nimplementation plan was designed based on the concept of the Modernization of the Revenue \nAdministration (Appendix 6). Key inputs under the TA include the preparation of a blueprint for \nthe modernized revenue administration (MRA) including a supporting time-bound action plan. \n \nC.  International Monetary Fund Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility-Extended \nFund Facility Arrangements \n \n4.  On 18 April 2003, IMF approved a 3-year program under the Poverty Reduction and \nGrowth Facility (PRGF) and the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangements, in an amount of \nSDRs269 million under PRGF plus SDR144.4 million under EFF.3 \n \n5.  The PRGF-EFF program aims to assist in restructuring the economy with the main focus \non  fiscal consolidation,  given  Sri Lanka\u2019s  high  debt  burden.  During  the  3-year  period,  the \nGovernment and IMF  agreed on program monitoring and review that consists of a set of \nquantitative performance criteria and a structural performance criterion and benchmarks. Under \nthe program, specific ceilings and floors for fiscal indicators were set including (i) net domestic \nfinancing of the central government budget, (ii) primary fiscal deficit, (iii) central government \nrevenue,  (iv)  net  claims  on  government  by  the  banking  system,  and  (v)  credit  to  public \n                                                 \n1  TA 3301-SRI commenced in January 2000 and was finalized in July 2003. \n2  TA 3906-SRI commenced in November 2002 and will be finalized in September 2003. \n3  The approved amount of PRGF arrangement is SDR269 million (65 % of quota). That of EFF arrangement is SDR \n144.4 million (35% of quota). \n ", "78  Appendix 14 \ncorporations by the banking system. These targets were derived from the medium-term fiscal \ntargets to reduce the budget deficit, on average, by about 1.25% of GDP per year, i.e., from \n8.9% of GDP in 2002 to 7.5% for 2003 and 4.3% by 2006. By 2006, the debt-to-GDP ratio was \ntargeted to reach 84% and interest rate payments to amount to 5.5% to GDP. To date, IMF has \ndisbursed only SDRs38.4 million from the PRGF and SDRs20.7 million from EFF. \n \n6.  The second tranche of the PRGF was originally due in December 2003. However, \nfollowing political developments linked to the president\u2019s dismissal of two cabinet ministers in \nNovember 2003, the Government\u2019s resolve to pass through critical legislation was affected and \nconsequently the second tranche was suspended. However, following the April 2004 elections \nand the formation of a new Government, the Government has prepared its Economic Policy \nFramework, including key macroeconomic and sector policies. The Government has met twice \nwith IMF, once at the sideline of the IMF/World Bank Annual Meetings in early October 2004 \nand the second time during an IMF consultation mission to Colombo on 18\u201322 October 2004. \nThis has led to preliminary policy dialogue on the Government\u2019s macroeconomic and medium-\nterm fiscal programs in preparation for the 2005 budget. Looking forward, the Government will \nbe finalizing its economic policy framework action plans and will be presenting its findings to \ndevelopment partners in early 2005. In the circumstances, a revised PRGF is not likely to be \nrenewed before early 2005. \n \nD.  World Bank  \n \n7.  During the reform period, the World Bank has planned to provide nonlending technical \nassistance in the public sector through a continuous and yearly updated public expenditure \nanalysis  and  country  financial  accountability  assessment  (CFAA).4  The  public  expenditure \nanalysis for 2003 commenced in August 2003. The CFAA was finalized in June 2003.  \n \n8.  CFAA  is  a  tool  designed  to  assess  the  urgent  reforms  needed  to  arrest  further \ndeterioration in public financial accountability. The assessment covers several areas including \n(i) parliamentary control of public funds, (ii) public financial management and reporting practices \nat the three levels of government including public enterprises, (iii) public audit, (iv) legislative \nscrutiny of public funds, and (v) rights to information. CFAA suggests two broad areas in \nresponse to address the problem. The first area is institutional reforms. New legislation and \nrules  are  needed  to  address  institutional issues.  The second  area is  capacity building  for \ntraining and improving organizational efficiency and effectiveness. \n \n9.  In terms of lending program, the World Bank approved on 17 June 2003 a $125 million \nPoverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) for Sri Lanka that built upon Regaining Sri Lanka. \nPRSC aimed at strengthening governance in the public sector, implementing reforms in financial \nmanagement and accountability, and addressing vital issues in environmental management. \nPRSC is a new lending instrument of the World Bank\u2019s International Development Association, \ndesigned to assist with the policy and institutional reforms that governments have formulated to \nimplement  their  own  poverty  reduction  strategies.  Unlike  earlier  policy  reform  support \ninstruments, PRSC is placed firmly within the Government\u2019s 3- to 4-year program, and a series \nof such credits over time is envisaged. Note that PRSC carries no policy conditions, since it \nrecognizes progress achieved to date. \n                                                 \n4  Country Assistance Strategy of the World Bank Group for the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. World \nBank. April 23, 2003. \n ", "  Appendix 14  79 \n10.  It was envisaged that a second PRSC would follow in 2004, a third in 2005, and a fourth \nin 2006 in the amount of $90 million each year. The 2004 PRSC expected to focus on civil \nservice reforms is now delayed in the wake of the change of Government and in anticipation of \nthe new Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. The PRSC carries no interest and 0.75% service \ncharge, maturing in 40 years with a 10-year grace period. \nE.  Others \n \n11.  The United Nations Development Programme has provided assistance for MIS linkup \nbetween  PCs  and  FC,  to  facilitate  the  flow  of  financial  information  across  sublevels  of \ngovernment. Additional assistance will be required for strengthening FC\u2019s capacity. \n \n12.  The US Treasury Department has also provided a budget advisor to the Ministry of \nFinance  for  a  2-year  assignment  beginning  in  mid-2003,  mostly  focusing  on  performance \nbudgeting and operational support. \n \n13.  The Government of Korea is providing the Government of Sri Lanka a loan for the \nprocurement of a Public Accounting and Financial Management Information System (PAFMIS). \nAccording to the feasibility study, the system will include three major procedures: (i) preparation \nof budget estimates (budgeting), (ii) distribution of treasury (warrant), and (iii) consolidation of \nexpenditure summaries (accounting).  \n \n ", " \nFigure A.14: Structure of Reforms and Coordination \n8\nISSUES  Large fiscal deficits and excessive debt  0\nThe Problem           \n \nFiscal consolidation
