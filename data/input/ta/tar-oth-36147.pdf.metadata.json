Given the increasing number of ongoing and planned projects of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) in the area of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), there is need to take \nstock  of  the  state  of  SME  development  in  the  region  and  elsewhere  and  review  the \neffectiveness of the adopted policy and institutional approaches with the aim of developing a \nconceptual framework and guidelines for future sector operations. The ADB Finance, Industry, \nTrade Committee identified the related technical assistance (TA) as one of the priorities for \ninterregional TA1.  The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n  \n2.   Most enterprises in developing member countries (DMCs) can be classified as SMEs.  \nAlthough exact definitions vary from country to country, SMEs account for the majority of total \nemployment  in  DMCs  and  produce  a  significant  share  of  each  country\u2019s  Gross  Domestic \nProduct. They also provide much of the growth of employment and income for many economies, \nwhile the contributions of larger enterprises tend to remain stable. SMEs tend to be more labor-\nintensive than their larger counterparts and, therefore, have lower capital costs associated with \nthe creation of new jobs.  Because of their size and structure, SMEs can be more flexible and \nadapt  to  market  needs  more  quickly  than  larger  enterprises  in  comparable  industries. \nParticularly in transitional economies, SMEs are expected to act as engines for private-sector-\nled economic growth and diversification.  Increases in SME efficiency can also improve the \ncompetitiveness  of  larger  firms  that  depend  on SME  suppliers,  and  therefore  improve  the \ncompetitive position of the economy as a whole.   \n \n3.  The SME sector comprises very different types of businesses across a wide range of \neconomic  sectors.    There  are  essentially  two  categories  of  SMEs:  those  that  are  growth-\noriented, and those small businesses and microenterprises that operate at the subsistence level \nand provide employment and income mainly for their owners and a relatively small number of \nexternal employees. The development of both types of SMEs helps reduce poverty directly \nbecause they contribute to economic growth and income generation. Subsistence enterprises \nrepresent the vast majority of SMEs in DMCs. Among the growth-oriented SMEs are businesses \nthat can be characterized as \u201cinnovators,\" which usually operate in growing markets, as well as \nbusinesses that are efficiency-oriented and/or network-intensive, which tend to grow through \nacquisitions.  \n \n4.  It is estimated that only about 10% of SMEs are fast growing.  Many growth-oriented \nSMEs in DMCs do not realize their potential because of poor competitiveness, inferior product \nquality, and low efficiencies due to backward technologies, outdated equipment, and a lack of \nmanagement skills and understanding of market demand. Further growth of SMEs in many \ncountries is constrained by (i) market failures, which restrict SMEs\u2019 access to finance and \nproduct markets; (ii) a policy, regulatory, and institutional environment that discriminates against \nsmaller  firms  or  is  associated  with  significant  compliance  costs;  (iii)  an  uncertain  legal \nenvironment, which impedes the enforcement of contractual obligations, including those related \nto debt recovery; and (iv) lack of adequate access to infrastructure, and business advisory and \ninformation services. \n \n                                                           \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) in March 2002. \n \n ", "2  \n5.  Most  DMCs  have  sought  to  develop  SMEs  through  special  policies  and  support \nmechanisms. Policy and institutional approaches to SME development vary greatly among \ncountries and range from the (often subsidized) provision of SME financing and other services \nthrough specialized public sector institutions to market-based finance and service mechanisms \nthat use private commercial service providers.   Recently there has been increasing emphasis \non promoting SME development by creating an enabling policy environment, which fosters SME \ncompetitiveness and reduces the transaction costs for smaller companies. The removal of \nregulatory and administrative barriers is expected to encourage enterprises operating in the \ninformal  economy  to  formalize  their  status,  which  is  a  precondition  for  expanding  their \noperations. \n   \n6.  In the related development debate, there has been a shift from supply-driven strategies \nto  market-driven  approaches.  In  finance,  the  supply-driven  subsidized  and  directed  credit \nschemes  of  the  past,  which  were  implemented  mainly  through  institutions  similar  to \ndevelopment finance institutions (DFIs), are generally not encouraged anymore because of their \ndistortionary  effects  and  lack  of  financial  sustainability.    Instead,  approaches  that  utilize \ncommercially driven allocation mechanisms have gained prominence.  The approaches include \nmeasures to facilitate commercial bank lending to SMEs by overcoming inherent collateral and \ninformation problems and introducing improved lending policies, systems, and procedures for \nSME clients; credit scoring models; credit information services; and credit guarantee funds that \nminimize moral hazard by sharing risks with banks.  In addition, leasing continues to be seen as \nan appropriate mechanism for addressing especially smaller businesses\u2019 lack of collateral. \nVenture capital funds for SMEs are still being promoted although there is growing realism about \ntheir viability.  This kind of financing is suitable for only a very few SMEs with high returns on \ncapital.  \n \n7.  In the area of business development services (BDS), models have evolved from the \ndirect  provision  of  (usually  subsidized)  services  by  a  fully  funded  public  intermediary \norganization in line with Government-determined priorities, to demand-oriented approaches as \nexemplified by voucher-based schemes, which seek to be more responsive to SME needs while \npromoting private domestic BDS providers.  SMEs are increasingly expected to share at least \nsome of the costs associated with such services to encourage effective use.  \n \n8.  Recent SME development concepts, especially for more developed economies, are also \ntaking  into  account  current  management  theories,  particularly  theories  related  to \ncompetitiveness clusters and supply-chain management, which are based on the economic \nbenefits of interfirm cooperation.  How to induce linkages among SMEs or between SMEs and \nlarger enterprises, that purchase their products and services is an area that is increasingly being \nlooked into, and for which project concepts are being tested. \n \n9.  ADB has been supporting SME development for several decades. Until the mid-1980s \nADB processed only a few SME-related projects, mainly in the form of credit lines, which were \nchanneled  through  specialized  DFIs  to  eligible  SMEs,  in  line  with  national  industrial \ndevelopment  strategies.    From  1987  to  1991,  ADB  intensified  its  SME-related  operations.  \nDuring this period, ADB financially supported SME development in a number of countries mainly \nthrough commercial financial institutions.  Associated TA sought to  strengthen the lending \nfunction of financial intermediaries and support the development of new financial instruments \nand credit information services.  With the shift in ADB\u2019s financial sector operations from the \nprovision  of  financial  intermediation-type  loans  to  policy-based  interventions  that  address \nunderlying structural weaknesses of the sector, the number of new SME projects declined \nsubstantially after 1991.   \n ", "  3\n10.  With ADB\u2019s adoption of poverty reduction as its overarching operational goal in 1999, \nthere has been renewed interest in SME-related projects, which are perceived to have direct \nbenefits  for  the  poor.      ADB  has  increasingly  been  seeking  to  address  policy  constraints \naffecting  SME  development.    The  creation  of  equal  opportunities  for  SMEs  and  larger \nenterprises has been pursued in a number of countries through policy-based loans that aim at \nenhancing industrial competitiveness.  In addition to promoting market-oriented economic and \nindustrial polices in DMCs, ADB has increasingly been focusing on firm-level issues that affect \nSMEs\u2019 competitiveness.  TAs that seek to introduce market-based BDS and facilitate SMEs\u2019 \naccess to finance are being implemented in a number of DMCs.  Planned SME projects are \nlikely to comprise policy-based components/projects that seek to establish a conducive policy, \nlegal, regulatory, and institutional environment for SMEs as well as technical and financial \nassistance for developing market-based financial services and BDS.    \n \n11.  Given ADB\u2019s increasing operational interest in SME development and the wide range of \nrelatively new approaches in this area, it is necessary to (i) assess the global experience with \nstrategies for developing SMEs, (ii) identify successful operational approaches DMCs and ADB \ncan use,  (iii) develop within ADB a vision that is shared with Government counterparts, and (iv) \ndevelop practical guidelines for SME operations.  \n \n \nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n12.   The TA aims at strengthening ADB support for SME development.  It will review SME \ndevelopment strategies and support mechanisms in DMCs and other relevant countries and, on \nthe basis of the assessment, develop a framework for designing and monitoring ADB-financed \nSME development programs. \n \n13.  The expected TA results and deliverables will include: \n \n(i)  successful strategies and mechanisms for SME development identified from the \nassessment of international research and experience, \n(ii)  a common vision and conceptual framework for ADB-supported SME programs \nand projects, \n(iii)  best practice guidelines for ADB-supported SME operations,  \n(iv)  a  comparative  interregional  database  on  SME  development  and  the  related \npolicy and institutional environment , \n(v)  a seminar to discuss TA findings with DMC representatives, and  \n(vi)  the  design  of  an  external  ADB    web  site  to  facilitate  access  to  relevant \ninformation on SME development strategies and mechanisms. \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n14.  The proposed TA will assess the relevance, cost-efficiency, and effectiveness of policy \nand  institutional  approaches  adopted  for  SME  development  in  selected  DMCs  and  other \ncountries.  It will also review the feasibility and applicability of new mechanisms for providing \nmarket-based business advisory services and finance to SMEs, as well as the use of cluster \nand supply-chain concepts for SME development. On the basis of this assessment and other \navailable  research,  key  driving  factors  as  well  as  effective  strategies  for  successful  SME \ndevelopment will be identified. \n ", "4  \n15.  To the extent possible, the assessment will draw on available research and the work of \naid agencies and organizations that are active in the field and in tangential areas such as \nmicrofinance and private sector development.  In particular, recommendations by relevant aid \ncommittees such as the Committee of Donor Agencies for Small Enterprise Development will be \nused. In some areas, however, additional information and analysis will be needed to ensure \noperational relevance.  \n \n16.  From the assessment, operational approaches for supporting the creation of a conducive \nSME policy, regulatory, and institutional environment as well as SME financing and BDS will be \nidentified.  Specific approaches for promoting growth-oriented SMEs and subsistence SMEs will \nbe developed, as necessary. The proposed strategies will consider the differences in business \nconditions  between  transitional  economies  and  economies  with  an  established  private \nenterprise sector.     \n \n17.  The  TA  will  seek  to  facilitate  the  development  of  common  positions  on  potentially \ncontroversial issues such as SME credit lines and credit guarantee schemes.  For each policy \nand institutional issue, a range of feasible options that respond to the different conditions, \nneeds, and development strategies of DMCs will be presented.  \n \n18.  Best-practice guidelines will be prepared to facilitate the formulation and implementation \nof SME programs and projects. The guidelines will contain detailed diagnostic, design, and \nmonitoring tools.  The preparation of sector roadmaps will be covered as well. \n \n19.  Meaningful indicators for assessing the state of SME development and the effectiveness \nof SME policies will be identified.  To ensure consistency, standardized indicators will be used to \nthe extent possible, given the differing definitions of SME in different countries and the inherent \nproblems with measuring activities of the informal sector. A comparative database for these \nindicators will be established to facilitate monitoring of SME development and the associated \npolicy environment in the selected DMCs and other countries. The database will initially cover \nDMCs with ADB SME operations and other Asian countries with successful SME sectors for \nbenchmarking  purposes.  It  will  contain  relevant  information  on  (i)  SMEs\u2019  contribution  to \neconomic growth, trade, and employment; and (ii) conditions and strategies for developing the \nSME subsectors including the underlying policy, legal, and institutional environment.  The aim is \nto identify a few, but useful, indicators that can be collected regularly and easily. The database \nwill  be  compiled  from  existing  studies  and  research,  in  particular  World  Bank  SME \nassessments, statistics of OECD, business environment surveys  financed by USAID, and ADB \nprivate sector assessments and investment climate surveys, which will be complemented by in-\ncountry assessments as required.  Upon completion, the database will be maintained by ADB \nwith inputs from other sources. \n \n20.  The  TA  will  also  develop  a  framework  for  assessing  and  addressing  social  and \nenvironmental concerns in the context of SME operations, taking into consideration international  \nexperience in this area. The situation of female entrepreneurs, their contributions to economic \ndevelopment,  and  the  impact  of  SME  development  on  female  employment  and  income \ngeneration will also be considered.   \n \n21.  To ensure the relevance of the TA findings, the recommendations will be discussed with \nrelevant public and private sector representatives from DMCs and from organizations engaged \nin SME development.  \n \n22.  The detailed terms of reference for the TA are in Appendix 2. \n ", "  5\n \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n23.  The TA is estimated to cost $400,000 and will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n24.   ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA.  The TA will be implemented over 9 \nmonths starting in March 2003.  The expected completion date is December 2003.  The TA will \ninvolve  about  9  person-months  of  international  and  about  10  person-months  of  domestic \nconsulting services.  A team of international and domestic consultants will be recruited on an \nindividual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The \ninternational  consultants  will  include  experts  on  SME  policies,  finance,  and  business \ndevelopment.  \n \n25.  The consultants will submit an inception report to ADB within 1 month from the start of \ntheir services. Draft final reports on each consultant\u2019s findings and recommendations will be \nsubmitted to ADB and the participants, at least 4 weeks before the planned workshop.  The final \nreports will incorporate workshop discussions and results and will be disseminated through the \nexternal ADB web site.  \n26.  A regional workshop will be held at ADB toward the end of the TA to facilitate the \nexchange of views on the TA findings among SME policy decision makers, practitioners, and \nSME representatives from DMCs and countries that have successfully developed SMEs. \n \n \n \nIV.
