The rapid integration of regional economies \nhas also increased the tempo of economic cycles, creating the need for frequent evaluation and \nassessment of existing economic policies.  If it is to be able to recommend relevant and \nappropriate  policy  measures  to  its  developing  member  countries  (DMCs),  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) must keep abreast of current development issues. ADB\u2019s capacity for \ninternal economic analysis and research therefore needs to be strengthened.   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2. ADB  is  committed  to  pursuing  sustainable  economic  growth,  inclusive  social \ndevelopment, and governance for effective policies and institutions in the region. To support \nthese efforts, ADB must have at its disposal a comprehensive assessment of current economic \ntrends, policy issues, and medium-term development prospects in the Asian and Pacific region. \nADB publishes the annual Asian Development Outlook1 (ADO) and ADO Update, which provide \ndetailed  macroeconomic  profiles  and  medium-term  growth  prospects  of  the  developing \neconomies in the region. They also cover the global economic environment and include a brief \ndiscussion on a relevant macro policy issue. An in-depth analysis of a special thematic issue is \npresented in Part III of ADO. To enhance and reinforce the knowledge base for this undertaking, \ntechnical  assistance2  (TA)  to  strengthen  the  economic  analysis  underpinning  the \nmacroeconomic  assessments  in  ADO  and  ADO  Update,  as  well  as  to  support  production \nquality, is proposed.  \n \n3.   The TA will continue to support ADB\u2019s goal of providing high-quality and comprehensive \neconomic assessments of trends, issues, and development prospects in the region. The TA will \ncontribute to ADB's visibility among senior policymakers in the DMCs, international research \ninstitutions, multilateral organizations, and the academic community. ADO and ADO Update \nlaunches are also major media outreach events for ADB. \n \n4.  To strengthen the forecasts and analyses in ADO, developing econometric models was \nemphasized.  The  previous  TA3  supported  an  economic  modeling  conference  to  initiate \ncollaboration and partnership among model builders and model users in the Asia-Pacific region. \nThe TA also supported the development of macroeconometric models for the People\u2019s Republic \nof China and the Philippines. These models have subsequently generated baseline forecasts for \nthese two DMCs that were used in the ADO 2004 Update.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n5.  The TA aims to improve the content and quality of ADO and ADO Update by further \ndeveloping economic forecasting and policy analysis models in support of ADB\u2019s short- and \nmedium-term country economic analysis and by ensuring high-quality economic editing of the \ncountry economic reports. The models being developed will be used to generate the short- and \n                                                 \n1 ADO is sold externally as well as extensively reviewed and commented on in the media. It is also the most popular \ndocument on the ADB Web site. \n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 9 July 2004. \n3 ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance for the Asian Development Outlook 2004.  Manila (TA No. 6135-REG). \n ", "2  \nmedium-term economic forecasts in the country chapters of ADO 2005 and ADO 2005 Update, \nas well as to strengthen the economic underpinnings of country programs and strategies for the \nDMCs to be covered. The models will also be used to improve the analytical content of ADO \nand  ADO  Update  through  quantitative  analysis  of  economic  policy.  Economic  editing  will \nimprove the quality and internal consistency of the analysis in the country economic chapters.  \nThe TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n6.  The following major activities are the milestones for the TA: \n \n(i)  Together with ADB country economists in regional departments (RDs) and resident \nmissions  (RMs)  and  economists  and  econometricians  in  institutions  in  selected \nDMCs, develop economic forecasting and policy analysis models based on available \nindicators.  \n \n(ii)  Organize a training workshop for the country writers of ADO 2005 and ADO 2005 \nUpdate on macroeconomics and forecasting techniques.  \n \n(iii)  Organize  a  second  economic  modeling  conference  to  discuss  progress  in  the \nmodeling exercises and exchange experience across the different countries.  \n \n(iv)  Hire the services of well-qualified economics editors to review the economic analysis \nin the country chapters for ADO 2005 and ADO 2005 Update.   \n \n7  The country participants in the ADO training workshop will be nominated by the RDs and \nRMs. Draft country chapters on each of ADB\u2019s borrowing member countries will be prepared by \ncountry economists of the RDs and RMs. The Macroeconomics and Finance Research Division \n(ERMF) will prepare draft country chapters on each of ADB\u2019s non-borrowing DMCs, administer \nthe ADO training workshop, coordinate the preparation of ADO 2005 and ADO 2005 Update, \nand  participate  in  the  dissemination  of  both  publications.  The  participants  in  the  second \neconomic modeling conference will be selected in consultation with the RDs and RMs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n8  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $250,000 equivalent4 (Appendix 2). The entire TA \nwill be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n9.  ERMF will implement the TA in close collaboration with the RDs (East and Central Asia, \nSoutheast Asia, South Asia, Mekong, and Pacific) and RMs. Developing the models will be a \ncollaborative exercise involving ERMF economists, country economists of the RDs and RMs, \nand national experts, so as to collectively build up capacity and ensure sustainability of the \ninvestments in the economic forecasting and policy analysis modeling work. The DMCs targeted \nfor  the  modeling  exercise  under  this  TA  will  be  ADB\u2019s  larger  borrowers  where  quarterly \neconomic data are available, namely, Bangladesh, India, Thailand, Pakistan, and Viet Nam. \nOther DMCs will be invited to the ADO technical conferences to share their experience of \n                                                 \n4 Approved Indicative Planning Figure for this TA is $225,000, and the supplementary amount of $25,000 will come \nfrom Economics and Research Department\u2019s TA savings in 2004. \n ", "  3\nquarterly modeling and to share the use of their models with ERMF and the ADB country \neconomists. The TA is expected to begin in December 2004 and to be completed by December \n2005. \n \n10.  The ADO Training Workshop for the country chapter writers on macroeoconomics and \nforecasting techniques is tentatively scheduled for December 2004 at ADB headquarters. The \neconomic modeling conference is tentatively scheduled for mid-2005 at ADB headquarters. The \nnumber of participants will be limited in order to maximize interactions. This second economic \nmodeling conference will review new and existing models as well as modeling activities in \nselected DMCs. Major international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, the \nWorld Bank and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development will be invited to \nshare their modeling experiences in the selected DMCs.   \n \n11.  The TA secretariat will consist of a TA supervising unit (TASU) officer, an economics \nofficer, and an administrative assistant. The main responsibilities of the secretariat will be as \nfollows.  First,  in  close  collaboration  with  the  RDs  and  the  RMs,  it  will  develop  baseline \nassumptions on external conditions, and development and policy issues to guide the country \neconomists who will prepare individual country reports on recent economic developments and \nmedium-term prospects. Second, the secretariat will plan and manage the ADO economic \nmodeling conference. Third, it will initiate networking with selected institutions in the region who \nare actively involved in model building. Fourth, publication activities for ADO 2005 will be \nundertaken and research results will be disseminated globally in collaboration with the Office of \nExternal Relations (OER), RMs and representative offices. Fifth, publication and dissemination \nactivities for ADO 2005 Update will be undertaken six months after publication of ADO 2005. \n \n12.  For ADO 2005, five domestic macroeoconometric modeling consultants (30 person-days \neach); one international economic editor (70 person-days); and one international copy editor \ncum desktop publishing specialist (60 person-days) will be engaged. For ADO 2005 Update, \none international economics editor (20 person-days) and one international copy editor cum \ndesktop publishing specialist (20 person-days) will be engaged. Appendix 3 gives the outline \nterms of reference for the consultants. The editors will review the draft manuscript before final \npublication. ADB will select and engage the consultants in accordance with the Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for selecting and engaging domestic consultants. \n \n13.  ADB staff will disseminate the major results of ADO 2005 and ADO 2005 Update to the \nmedia, DMC policymakers, and the academic community. The dissemination activities will be \ncoordinated by OER in cooperation with ERMF. The RMs launch the publications in selected \nDMCs. Both publications will be featured in the ADB Web site, and CD-ROM and printed copies \nwill be distributed worldwide. ERMF will circulate internally a report on the outcome of the \nmodeling exercise with proposals on how to build on this TA for future issues of ADO and in \npossible applications of the macroeconometric models in country work.   \n \n \n \n ", "4  \nIV.
