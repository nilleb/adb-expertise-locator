Recent consultations between the Government of India (the Government) and the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) have highlighted the need for ADB to strengthen its India program \nthrough creation and integration of focused knowledge products into its operational program and \nenhanced capacity building. In specific, the Government requested ADB support and assistance \nfor (i) studies and analytical work on various aspects  relevant to ADB operations in India; \n(ii) dissemination of knowledge created; (iii) enhanced effectiveness of portfolio management \nthrough frequent exchange of project implementation experiences; (iv) dissemination of best \npractices; and  (v) capacity enhancement  of executing agencies (EAs), among others. ADB \nrecognized the importance of these activities to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of \noperations  in  India.  It  held  extensive  consultations1  with  the  Government  and  reached \nagreement on the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation  arrangements,  and  cost  and \nfinancing arrangements of the proposed technical assistance (TA).2 The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.   ISSUES \n \n2.  Sustainable growth through infrastructure development is a key instrument for poverty \nreduction.  The  Country  Strategy  and  Program  2003\u20132006  (CSP)  for  India3  emphasized \ninfrastructure-led growth and poverty reduction. It cited findings from country poverty analyses \nthat, for every 1.0% growth, absolute poverty levels declined by 0.7%. Based on this, ADB\u2019s \nportfolio in India sought to reduce poverty through physical and social infrastructure, including \nurban sector interventions. It was expanded to include pro-poor sectors such as rural roads, \nrural finance, and irrigation and water resource development. There has also been increased \nfocus on relatively poorer states, or those with weaker institutional and financial capacities, such \nas Assam, Chattisgarh, Jammu and Kashmir, Orissa, West Bengal, and the northeast. With \nsuch strategic changes in the country program, a strong need was felt to analyze developmental \nissues \u2014 and their linkages and impacts \u2014 to ensure enhanced overall and sector efficiencies. \nThe proposed TA will enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the ongoing program, and \nidentify gaps and opportunities for further ADB involvement.  \n \n3.  Capacity  building  is  necessary  for  operational  effectiveness.  This  TA  proposes  to \naddress the  strongly felt needs  of  the  Government  and  ensure  client  responsiveness  by \nsupporting capacity enhancement in  newer sectors and states of operation, and those with \nweaker capacities. The Government has emphasized transfer of national and regional best \npractices, and dissemination of information on these practices, to improve the design of projects \nin different states and sectors of intervention. There is high potential for cross learning from \neffectively implemented projects in India and the region as a whole. Likewise, there is much \nscope for knowledge enhancement and capacity building through information dissemination at \nworkshops, conferences, meetings, training programs, and retreats.    \n \n4.  The  proposed  TA  will  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  ADB  operations  in  India  by \nsupporting needs-based consultancy and small projects in areas of social development and \npoverty  reduction  relevant  to  the  operational  program.  Integrating  Poverty  Reduction  in \nPrograms and Projects, financed by the Government of the United Kingdom,4 addressed similar \n                                                 \n1 Fact-finding was completed in December 2005 \n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 19 December 2005. \n3 Asian Development Bank. 2003. Country Strategy and Program, India, 2003-2006. Manila. \n4 ADB.2002. Technical Assistance to India for Integrating Poverty Reduction in Programs and Projects. Manila. (TA  \n3880\u2014IND, for $640,000, approved in June).  ", "2     \nconcerns  and  offers  lessons  in  designing  and  implementing  generic  TAs  of  the  nature \ndescribed. An independent consultant evaluated the components of this TA in the context of \noverall evaluation of trust fund arrangements with the Government of the United Kingdom.5 The \nstudy highlighted that arrangements such as funding of  consultants, as was done on a needs \nbasis under TA 3880, (footnote 4), have supported sensitization and building local capacity to \ndeal with poverty issues. Such measures have been critical in reinforcing a poverty focus in TAs \nand loans in India's portfolio.  A midterm review of the TA in May 2005 showed that  it had \ngenerated a good response from civil society, encouraging grassroots impact, and has created \nimportant lessons for ADB\u2019s engagement with nongovernment organizations (NGOs) in India.  \n \n5.  The memorandum of understanding signed between ADB and  the Government of the \nUnited Kingdom in 2001 emphasized supporting activities such as knowledge sharing and \ndissemination. It also advocated (i) financing preparatory or appraisal studies, (ii) knowledge \nsharing and dissemination, and  (iii) impact  assessment  and  recruitment  of  consultants  to \nsupport this. The overall objective is to create an enabling environment for sustainable growth \nand poverty reduction. The proposed TA will address the strategic focus of the Government, \nADB, and the DFID Trust Fund in this regard.  \n \n6.  Given the large size of the India program, averaging $1.5 billion a year, it is important to \ncontinuously mainstream development outcomes to enhance operational effectiveness. This \nrequires a  flexible  and  response-based approach to client needs  as well as  flexibility  in \nidentifying and undertaking activities that emerge from project level experiences.  \n \nIII.   THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome6 \n7.  The objective of the  proposed  TA is to enhance  the  effectiveness  of  ADB  India \noperations  through  effective  knowledge  management,  dissemination,  and  capacity \nenhancement of weaker EAs and states where ADB operations have recently started (Assam, \nChattisgarh, Jammu and Kashmir, Orissa, West Bengal,  and the northeast, among others). In \nterms of knowledge management, the TA will support analytical and sector studies and impact \nassessments in areas of operational relevance (such as transport, energy, urban infrastructure, \nfinance, agriculture, and water resources). It will also support state-level studies and thematic \nassessments where relevant. Under capacity enhancement, the TA will support (i) knowledge-\nsharing activities, (ii) dissemination of best practices, (iii) capacity building, and (iv) provision of \nconsultancy as required. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The  TA  will  assist  in  key  activities  for  knowledge  management  and  capacity \nenhancement under the following seven designated clusters.                    \n \n9.  Analytical Studies, Sector Work, and Impact Assessments.  The TA will support \nundertaking needs-based analytical and sector studies, and impact assessments. In particular, \nthe studies will help analyze (i) important crosscutting components under sector interventions; \n(ii)  issues  influencing  service  delivery,  such  as  social  exclusion  and  participation; \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n(iii) performance of development interventions when a follow-up project or sector intervention is \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n                                                 \n5  Srivastava, Ravi Shankar. 2004. Evaluation of the DFID/ADB Trust Fund for India. New Delhi, \n6  Financed by the United Kingdom Cooperation Fund (Poverty Focused) for Technical Assistance. \n ", "    3 \nproposed;  (iv)  development  issues  relating  to  new  states  or sectors  of  intervention; and \n(v) important emerging development modalities, such as public private partnerships. The TA will \ncover about eight to 10 such studies with a maximum outlay of $30,000\u2013$40,000 each. The \nstudies/assessments undertaken under the cluster will be focused on ADB\u2019s ongoing and future \nprogram in India, and will be carried out by accredited institutions/firms. The terms of reference \n(TOR) for the proposed work and its documentation plan will be provided by the sector division \nrequesting the work. They will be finalized in consultation with key stakeholders, including sector \ndivisions in ADB, line ministries, state executing agencies, and  government institutions, as \nrelevant. They will be endorsed by an advisory committee to be set up under the TA (para 18). \nA  memorandum  of  understanding  will  be  signed  with  each  of  the  institutions  to  ensure \nagreement on the TOR and presentation of the outcomes of the study.   \n \n10.  Conferences, Seminars, and Workshops.  The TA will support conferences, seminars, \nand workshops on a selective but focused basis. These may be related to (i) important social \npriorities  involving  the  Millennium  Development  Goals,  (ii)  knowledge  enhancement  in \noperational areas, and (iii) areas of strategic focus as spelled out in the CSP. The relevance of \nevents will need to be clearly defined in order to be approved. \n \n11.  Meetings and Retreats on Portfolio Matters.  ADB\u2019s operations in India have been \nexpanding in terms of new states and sectors. As a result, several operational matters have \nemerged that need to be discussed, brainstormed, and resolved. Because of ADB\u2019s large and \ndiverse  portfolio  in  India,  and  varying  degrees  of  problems  across  sectors  and  states, \nperformance has to be steered through regular and intensive interaction with implementing \nagencies.  Such  meetings  and  retreats  on  portfolio  matters,  in  recent  months,  have  been \nextremely  useful  to  improve  portfolio  performance.  For example,  in  2005,  disbursements \ndoubled from $320 million to $640 million and it is hoped that they will reach $1 billion by \n2006\u201407. Meetings of various  EAs in sectors of ADB operation also serve as an important \ncross-learning platform between agencies and states. About 12\u201315 such meetings and retreats \nare  proposed  to  be  held  during  the  3-year  duration  of  the  TA,  averaging  $20,000  each. \nDecisions on these meetings will be based on mutual agreements between the ADB and the \nGovernment.   \n \n12.  Learning of National and Regional Best Practices through Study Tours. There is \nlarge untapped potential in terms of utilizing cross learning from successful projects to improve \nthe quality of the design and implementation of ADB projects in India. There are vast sector-\nrelated and state-level experiences from previously completed projects within the country as \nwell as innovative experiences in the region.  To avoid duplication of efforts with individual \nprojects, this facility will support study tours (i) only in projects where there is no committed \nallocation for this purpose, and (ii) for scoping exercises for new interventions or exploratory \nprojects without a committed budget. These study tours will cover new sectors identified by the \nGovernment for intervention (such as tourism and urban transport) or large future follow-up \ninterventions in existing sectors. The Government greatly values such cross learning and has \nfrequently emphasized the need for incorporation of best practices at country and regional level \ninto various projects. The proposed TA will support the documentation of best practices and \nhands-on learning through site visits by those directly concerned with project design and \nimplementation. Sector specialists/mission leaders of various projects will prepare requests \nunder this cluster, including suggestions on the team composition and highlights of project(s) to \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nbe visited. Participating officials/members will be required to prepare and provide a two-page \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nreport on how they propose to operationalize the lessons learned from the study tours and \nconduct a dissemination seminar for EAs and sector departments. All study tour proposals will \nbe endorsed by the advisory committee set up under the TA. \n ", "4     \n \n13.  Capacity Building of Executing Agencies on Operational Policies and Procedures. \nIn many ongoing projects, lack of adequate information and understanding of ADB policies and \nprocedures (including social safeguards, procurement, consultant recruitment, etc.) is cited as a \ncause of operational delays. Capacity building under the proposed TA will cover both old and \nnew  EAs and states. It will also  support  capacity  building  on  various  aspects  of  project \nimplementation, particularly in slow-disbursing projects. All interventions will be needs based, \nidentified by the EA/ADB, and approved by the advisory committee. The project officer will \nobtain feedback from participating officials on the relevance and usefulness of training, and \nprepare a report  for the advisory committee. \n \n14.  Recruitment of Long- and Short-Term Consultants.  Domestic long- and short-term \nconsultants will be recruited to provide specialized inputs in the operational sectors, states, and \ncrosscutting themes (four to five short-term consultants and one long-term consultant). Short-\nterm consultants will be hired on a needs basis. TOR for the short-term consultants will be \nprovided  by  the  sector  division  requesting  consulting  services.  A  long-term  knowledge \nmanagement consultant (domestic) will provide inputs to enhance the effectiveness of the TA on \na continuous basis. The consultant\u2019s responsibilities will include (i) providing background inputs \non relevant knowledge products available in identified areas, (ii) best practices available for the \nvarious sectors,  (iii) preparing background material for dissemination and capacity building \nevents, (iv) feedback on the effectiveness of capacity enhancement strategies being used along \nwith real-time suggestions, and  (v) support for  TA administration. About 50\u201360 months of \ndomestic consulting services are envisaged. International expertise will be co-opted in the form \nof resource persons for documenting and training on international best practices. \n \n15.  Select Poverty Reduction Interventions.  The TA proposes to support projects of \ndevelopmental NGOs and community-based organizations which have linkages to ADB projects \nand/or sectoral interventions and priorities. The projects will (i) support existing operations, \n(ii) typically cost $10,000\u2013$30,000, (iii) promote social and human development goals, (iv) \nredress social exclusion, and  (v) promote empowerment and equity. An example of such \nprojects in the transport sector would include support to redress HIV/AIDS and promote road \nsafety. Such projects would be excellent value added in terms of helping promote ADB\u2019s poverty \nreduction strategy and mainstreaming human development in India to support achievement of \nthe Millennium Development Goals. They would complement ADB\u2019s CSP in India by directly \nsupporting  poverty  reduction  and  inclusive  social  development;  and  facilitate  enhanced \ncooperation between ADB, the Government, and NGOs/community-based organizations. The \nIndia Resident Mission (INRM) will formulate appropriate project selection, implementation, and \nmonitoring guidelines and procedures in consultation with the advisory committee. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total estimated cost of the TA is $2,500,000, of which $2,000,000 will be financed on \na grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom, and administered by ADB. Local \ncurrency costs are $1,630,000 and foreign currency costs are $370,000. The Government will \nprovide  counterpart  contribution  in  kind  estimated  at  $500,000.  The  cost  estimates  and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n17.  The Department of Economic Affairs will be the EA for the TA. However, various \nimplementing  agencies  responsible  for  ADB-financed  projects  and  programs,  INRM,  and \n ", "    5 \nrelevant ADB divisions dealing with India will have access to various provisions of the TA in \nterms of suggested areas for study, capacity building, highlighting international best practices, \nand  using  of  consultants expertise on  a  needs  basis.  INRM  will  coordinate  the  overall \nimplementation of the TA.   \n \n18.  An advisory committee, headed by the INRM country director, will be constituted. It will \ncomprise (i) ADB's project officer; (ii) INRM sector specialists, who will also consult and reflect \nthe views of sector divisions at the South Asia Regional Department  (SARD); and  (iii) a \ngovernment representative. The advisory committee will meet at least once every 6 months. To \nensure a timely response to operational requirements, the approval mechanism  will be as \nfollows:  (i) for activities such as analytical work, impact assessments, and small grant projects \nthat can be identified and planned in advance, the advisory committee will endorse inclusion of \nsuch  proposals;  (ii)  activities  under  other  clusters  (such  as  workshops,  seminars  and \nconferences, meetings and retreats, learning events, and capacity building) will be put up to the \nhead of the advisory committee (i.e., INRM country director) for approval;  and (iii) no objection \nconcurrence  of  the  EA  will  be  obtained  for  recruitment  of  consultants.  These  approval \nmechanisms have been designed to ensure the timely response of the proposed TA to various \noperational requirements. At the end of each year, the advisory committee will meet to review \nprogress on the TA. A representative from the Department for International Development of the \nGovernment of the United Kingdom will be a member  of the advisory committee for such \nmeetings.  \n \n19.  The  knowledge  management  consultant and other short-term  consultants  engaged \nunder the TA will be engaged by ADB in accordance with  ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants.  Draft  TOR  for  the  knowledge  management  consultant  are  in  Appendix 3. \nInternational resource persons will be hired on a needs basis; their involvement will be endorsed \nby the INRM country director and reported to the advisory committee. They will  (i) support \ndocumentation of international best practices; (ii) support dissemination of best practices; and \n(iii) participate in TA workshops, seminars, and conferences as required. The project officer will \nhave overall responsibility for ensuring the achievement of the TA\u2019s strategic directions, and to \nfacilitate coordination and involvement of relevant ADB divisions. \n \n20.  The Government, as the EA, will be a proactive partner in the execution of this TA. It will \nparticipate in advisory committee  meetings and nominate staff for participation in capacity \nbuilding events. Relevant studies will be published on the internet for wider dissemination, in \nconsultation with the Government. The TA will be implemented over a period of 3 years from \n1 April 2006 to 31 March 2009.  \n \nIV.   THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n \n21.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of  $2,000,000 to the Government of  India to be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Government  of  the  United  Kingdom  for  Knowledge \nManagement and Capacity Building. \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n ", "6    Appendix 1   \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact      Assumption \nIncreased efficiency of ADB  Feedback on 8\u201310 studies  Review missions  Executing agencies use \noperations  undertaken based on case    findings from the studies/ \n  study   Impact assessments  capacity enhancement \n    exercises to improve policy \nParticipation of functional  Case studies  making and implementation \nstaff in capacity     \nenhancement   Minutes of advisory \n  committee meetings \nReduction of time taken to \nengage consultants, \nprocure goods, and \ndisburse (before and after \nindicators for EAs to which \ncapacity-building \nintervention is targeted) \n \nNumber of projects, \nmanuals, and reports  \nwhere TA outputs serve as \ninputs (including reports \nand recommendations of \nthe President, TA papers, \nand project administration \nmemorandum) \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nEnhanced portfolio performance  Number of executing  Review missions  \u2022  Stakeholder commitment \nof ADB operations in India   agencies or loan projects    to incorporate outputs of \n  that benefited from TA  Impact assessments and  the TA into policy and \n  activities   appraisals  planning processes \n    \u2022  Staff trained through \nDisbursement ratio  Minutes of advisory  capacity building \n  committee meetings  institutionalize the \nParticipation in capacity  training lessons \nenhancement and internal  Risks \ndissemination  \u2022  Study outcomes are not \naccomplished  adequately disseminated \n  or utilized \n  \u2022  Staff are transferred or \ndo not support integration \nof best practices and \ntraining \nOutputs      Assumptions \n\u2022  Study reports   Completion of 8\u201310 studies  Periodic TA review by  \u2022  Timely compliance \n\u2022  Best practices    ADB staff  \u2022  Active participation of \ndocumentation  12\u201315 portfolio retreats    stakeholders \n\u2022  Reports on capacity    Impact assessments   \nbuilding and relevance   Support for select   \n\u2022  Reports on study tours   knowledge dissemination  Minutes of advisory \n\u2022  Project reports on small  activities   committee meetings \nThgera vnite awcsti veitxiepsr essed herein  are those of the consultant  and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n  members, Board of DirectorsT,i mMealyn aegngeamgeenmte, notr o sft aff, andA mnnauya lb Ree pvireewli mreipnoarrty o ifn  nature.  \nconsultants  the advisory committee \n   \nNumber of projects/sectors \n ", "  Appendix 1  7  \nwhere poverty reduction \nwas mainstreamed through \nimplementation of small \ngrant projects \n \n   \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs \n\u2022  Studies and impact assessments (8-10 studies)  \u2022  ADB \n\u2022  Conferences, seminars, and workshops (15-20 events)  \u2022  Government \n\u2022  Meetings and retreats on important portfolio matters (12-15 portfolio retreats)  \u2022  Development partner \n\u2022  Dissemination of best practices   (Cofinancing) \n\u2022  Capacity building of executing agencies on important operational matters (Needs \nbased as indicated by the Advisory Committee) \n\u2022  Consultancy inputs (50-60 person months of domestic consulting services) \n\u2022  Select poverty and social development interventions \n \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, EA = executing agency, TA = technical assistance. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------    ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n       Tadashi Kondo            Kunio Senga \n    Country Director                               Director General    \n    India Resident Mission                                   SARD \n     \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n ", "8  Appendix 2 \n \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($'000) \n \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost \nA.
