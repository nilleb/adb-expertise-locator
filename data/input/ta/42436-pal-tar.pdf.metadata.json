INTRODUCTION \n1.  Palau's physical, geographical, and economic characteristics underscore the country's \nfragility. It has a small population and is vulnerable to external economic shocks, and climate \nchange is affecting the stability of its formal and subsistence economies. Its dependency on aid \nfor the delivery of core government functions exacerbates its vulnerability, particularly in the \nuncertain environment of the financial support of the Compact of Free Association1 and the \nglobal economic crisis. The emerging tourism sector is a driver of economic development. \nPalauans  are  committed  to  long-term  development  and  work  collaboratively  to  identify \ndevelopment priorities. \n \n2.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS)  for  Palau \n(2009\u20132013) focuses on three areas: (i) improving public sector effectiveness; (ii) facilitating \nprivate  sector  development,  including  through  the  provision  of  basic  infrastructure;  and \n(iii) managing the threat of climate change by improving environmental resilience.2 Included with \nimproving public sector effectiveness is the implementation of a medium-term budget framework. \nThe  CPS  directly  supports  implementation  of  Palau's  medium-term  development  strategy \n(MTDS) (2009\u20132014) including Palau's medium-term fiscal strategy (MTFS) in alignment with \nthe objectives of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.3 The MTDS sets Palau's overall \ndevelopment  objectives,  provides  a  forward  action  plan  for  all  line  ministries,  aligns  with \nStrategy 2020,4 and builds upon Working in Fragile Environments: A Midterm Review of the \nPacific Strategy 2005\u20132009.5 \n \n3.  The  proposed  capacity  development  technical  assistance  (TA)\u2014Implementing  a \nMedium-Term Budget Framework\u2014is designed to strengthen the budget framework in Palau. \nThis will help the Government achieve its MTFS by providing information to enable it to (i) use \nscarce fiscal resources in an efficient manner; and (ii) move toward greater self-reliance with \nrespect  to  financing  government  expenditure.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1. The TA is part of a longer-term program of support for Palau. Under previous TA,6 \nADB provided support to develop Palau's MTDS and MTFS. This TA is the next step in that \nprocess\u2014building on the MTDS and MTFS, and making those strategies operational through \nthe budgeting process. In addition, the Palau CPS includes this TA within a broader framework \nof capacity development support. \n \n4.  In conceptualizing the assistance, consultations were conducted during preparation of \nthe CPS.7 Particular consultations on the TA concept paper were conducted from 13 to 15 May \n2009  and  on  24  July  2009.8 The  major  agreements  with  the  Government  on  the  impact, \noutcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of \nreference are reflected in this TA paper. \n                                                 \n1  The Compact of Free Association defines the relationship between Palau and the United States and is central to \nthe economy.

Manila (TA 4929-PAL). \n7  Preparation of the CPS included broad community and business consultations through public workshops on the \nMTDS, financed under the TA for the Facility for Economic and Infrastructure Management (footnote 6). \n8  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 5 August 2009.  \n ", "2   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  Palau\u2019s fiscal position is unsustainable due to limited domestic revenues and a large \ngovernment wage bill. From FY1995 to FY 2006, domestic revenue covered an average of just \n40% of total expenditure. Grants, concessional loans, and drawdowns from the Compact of \nFree Association Trust Fund covered the rest. The public services wages and salaries bill has \nbeen the fastest-growing component of current expenditure, rising from a share of 40.6% in \nFY1995  to  50.5%  in  FY2006.  In  addition,  while  the  design  of  budget  and  performance \nmanagement systems is broadly sound, implementation of these systems is weak. The Ministry \nof Finance has limited capacity to analyze and refine budget submissions to fit with its fiscal \nconstraints and align with development objectives. \n \n6.  Recognizing  these  issues,  in  May  2008  the  Pacific  Financial  Technical  Assistance \nCentre (PFTAC), at the request of ADB and the Palau Government, carried out a scoping study \nto  look  at  options  for  developing  a  medium-term  budget.9 The  study  found  that  while  the \nprinciple of medium-term budgeting is well recognized in the Palau Budget Reform Act, 2001, \nsystems and capacity are needed to ensure that fiscal forecasts are developed on a medium-\nterm basis. \n \n7.  A medium-term budget is one part of a financial management framework, which includes \nan MTFS and a medium-term expenditure framework. An MTFS provides a top\u2013down statement \nof fiscal policy objectives and sector strategies;10 a medium-term budget framework sets out \nprojections of spending by individual agencies and allocates resources in line with strategic \npriorities  over  the  medium  term;  and  a  medium-term  expenditure  framework  extends  the \nanalysis with more detailed costing within sectors and with performance measures. \n \n8.  The PFTAC scoping study set out a timetable for implementing a medium-term budget in \nPalau over two budget cycles. Key recommendations include (i) preparing and enhancing fiscal \nand  macroeconomic  frameworks  and  forecasts;  (ii)  improving  revenue  projection  capacity; \n(iii) enhancing the capacity to prepare and analyze budget submissions; and (iv) introducing a \ncash management and internal audit process. \n \n9.  Fiscal and Macroeconomic Frameworks and Forecasts. Palau's MTFS focuses on \nthe country becoming more self-reliant with respect to financing government expenditure. The \nkey actions are to (i) undertake comprehensive, effective, and fair tax reform; (ii) significantly \nreduce current government expenditure; and (iii) improve government efficiency (footnote 10).  \nThe  current  fiscal  strategy  includes  only  broad  financial  estimates,  which  do  not  guide \nimplementation. The macroeconomic capacity of the Ministry of Finance also needs to be \nstrengthened  and  projections  need  to  be  made  with  a  medium-term  perspective. \nMacroeconomic data need to be refined and systematized for use in the projections. \n \n10.  Revenue Projection. The process of projecting revenue needs to be strengthened, \nespecially for the medium term. Currently, the generally conservative revenue estimates are \nbased on trends. The revenue projection model, previously developed for the budgeting process, \nwas not utilized for FY2010. It needs to be reviewed to ensure it remains relevant and is \nincorporated within existing processes. \n                                                 \n9  Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre. 2008.

While  the  Ministry  of  Finance  provides  line  ministries  with \ninstructions on procedures to be followed and the content of budget submissions, it does not \nprovide detailed parameters, including economic parameters that can be effectively used in \ncosting programs on a medium-term basis. In addition, line ministries' capacity to soundly cost \nexisting and new policies needs to be strengthened. Performance reports of the line ministries, \nindicating performance against targets, need to be developed. In addition, Ministry of Finance \ncapacity to critically analyze budget submissions from line ministries and to provide feedback on \nperformance needs to be enhanced. \n \n12.  Cash Management and Internal Audit. The Government needs to set up a formal cash \nplanning system (including investment planning and debt management) to enable it to allocate \nresources to line ministries in a more predictable manner and to allow better service delivery \nbased on predictability of resources. Furthermore, no internal audit function is in place to guide \nand advise the Ministry of Finance and line ministries. As a preliminary step to dealing with the \nfirst of these concerns, PFTAC has developed a cash management manual for Palau and is in \ndiscussions with the Government to provide a training seminar on implementing the manual. \nThe recently completed report, An Evaluation of Internal Audit in Pacific Countries: The Way \nForward,11 includes Palau as one of the countries studied. ADB TA for Strengthening Public \nFinancial Management in Pacific Developing Member Countries includes regional support for \ndeveloping internal audit.12 \n \n13.  The TA will work with the Ministry of Finance (including the Forecasting Committee \nmade up of representatives from the Bureau of Budget and Planning, Bureau of Revenue, \nCustoms and Tax, Bureau of National Treasury, and Statistics Department) and line ministries \nto provide support to develop and implement a medium-term budget framework. \n \n14.  Specifically,  the  TA  will  focus  on  three  areas:  (i)  strengthening  the  overall  budget \nframework  by  providing  support  to  improve  macroeconomic  data  and  revenue  forecasting; \n(ii) supporting line ministries to prepare budgets consistent with the framework by, for example, \nproviding  assistance  with  costing  policies  over  the  medium  term  and  developing  key \nperformance targets to monitor performance; and (iii) supporting the Ministry of Finance to \nanalyze budget submissions and prepare a consolidated budget consistent with the framework \nand the MTFS. \n \n15.  TA implementation will consider the findings from the recently completed report into \nPacific capacity development.13 While the Ministry of Finance in Palau is responsive to change \nand is starting from a reasonably high skill base, the ministry is small and the intended outputs \nwill need to progress at an appropriate pace given its capacity. The study notes that TA \neffectiveness depends largely on human dynamics, which are shaped by the advisers' personal \nand professional qualities. The study notes that much also hinges on the extent to which the \nprocesses allow local partners to use their own capacity (existing or emergent) to find their own \nsolutions to their particular challenges. Working within existing systems, which are broadly \nsound, will be important to TA success. In addition, the TA will recruit a national consultant \nduring TA implementation to support the delivery of TA outputs. \n \n                                                 \n11 Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center. 2008.

Furthermore,  ADB's  recently  completed  special  evaluation  study  provides \nrecommendations that will be incorporated into TA implementation.14 The study identifies that \nline agencies require more sustained capacity development assistance than oversight agencies; \naccordingly, the TA will focus support on selected line ministries. Consistent with the study \nrecommendations, an information program for awareness raising and understanding of the TA \nwill be developed. The information program will consider mechanisms for enhancing community \nawareness (particularly business groups) and where possible integrating civil society and other \nstakeholder representatives in the process. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n17.  The impact of the TA will be a strengthened budget framework in Palau. The outcome of \nthe TA is a medium-term budget framework that aligns with the MTDS. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n18.  The TA is intended to deliver the following outputs in the period from February 2010 to \nFebruary 2013. \n \n19.  Fiscal Policy Framework Updated Annually. The TA will work with the Ministry of \nFinance to prepare a fiscal policy framework that is consistent with the MTFS. The framework \nwill include medium-term financial estimates and be based on up-to-date macroeconomic data. \nThe fiscal policy framework will be a rolling document that will be updated annually and used to \nguide preparation of the medium-term budget. \n \n20.  Revenue  Projection  Model  For  Producing  Medium-Term  Forecasts. The TA will \nwork with the Ministry of Finance to (i) review the existing revenue projection model; and \n(ii) update the model based on this review and integrate it with the budget process. \n \n21.  Annual  Budgets  of  Selected  Line  Ministries  Consistent  with  the  Fiscal  Policy \nFramework. The TA will work with the Ministry of Health; Ministry of Education; and Ministry of \nPublic Infrastructure, Industries and Commerce to (i) cost their programs on a medium-term \nbasis based on the fiscal policy framework; and (ii) develop key performance targets to monitor \nthe performance of the line ministries against the budget. \n \n22.  Consolidated Medium-Term Government Budget Consistent with the Fiscal Policy \nFramework and the MTFS. The TA will work with the Ministry of Finance to prepare a budget \ndocument that is consistent with the fiscal policy framework and the MTFS. As part of this \nprocess, the TA will support the ministry to critically analyze budget submissions from line \nministries. \n \n23.  To contribute to the delivery and sustainability of these outputs, a half-day seminar will \nbe held early during TA implementation for elected representatives on the TA approach and \noutputs. The seminar will also provide an overview of medium-term budgeting. Support to the \nMinistry of Finance and the selected line ministries will be primarily provided through mentoring \nand on-the-job training. One-day seminars will be held for the Ministry of Finance and selected \nline ministries to outline the fiscal policy framework once complete, and advise on the budget \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2009.

Cost and Financing \n24.  The TA is estimated to cost $560,000 equivalent. The Government has requested ADB \nfinancing of $500,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's Technical \nAssistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The Government will finance the balance of the cost, \nequivalent  to  $60,000,  through  provision  of  office  space,  communications  facilities  for \nconsultants, and other in-kind contributions. Appendix 2 provides details of the cost estimates \nand  financing  plan.  The  proceeds  of  the  TA  will  be  disbursed  in  line  with  the  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook.16 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n25.  The Ministry of Finance (Bureau of Budget and Planning) will be the Executing Agency \nand Implementing Agency for the TA. The Ministry of Health; Ministry of Education; and Ministry \nof Public Infrastructure, Industries, and Commerce will be the selected line ministries to be \nsupported under the TA. \n \n26.  The TA will be implemented over 36 months, starting in February 2010. The TA will \nfinance up to 10 person-months of international consulting services and 22 person-months of \nnational consulting services. The international consultants will comprise (i) a budget expert and \nteam leader (international, 8 person-months, intermittent); and (ii) an economist (international, 2 \nperson-months, intermittent). The national consultant\u2014a budget adviser\u2014will be employed for \nthe duration of the TA (22 person-months, intermittent). The expected completion date of the TA \nis June 2013. \n \n27.  ADB  will  engage  an  international  consulting  firm  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection  method  (80:20)  and  through  biodata  technical  proposals  in  accordance  with  the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Terms of reference \nfor consultants are in Appendix 3. The TA will not require any procurement. \n \n28.  Implementation of TA activities needs to be consistent with the system of Government in \nPalau (which is largely based on the United States system). Accordingly, experience in the \nnorthern  Pacific\u2014and  an  understanding  of  financial  and  budget  processes  in  systems  of \nGovernment  that  follow  or  are  modeled  on  United  States  systems\u2014are  considered  highly \ndesirable criteria in consultant selection. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n29.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Republic of Palau for Implementing a Medium-Term Budget Framework, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n15 PFTAC will be involved in the review and delivery of seminar materials. \n16  ADB. 2008.

Budget Expert and Team Leader (international, 8 person-months, intermittent) \n3.  The budget expert and team leader will have extensive experience (more than 15 years) in \na public finance role and be experienced in budget formulation, implementation, and monitoring. \nExperience gained from working in a ministry of finance (or equivalent) in a capacity development \nrole is highly desirable. Experience in developing countries in the Pacific (particularly the northern \nPacific) is highly desirable. An understanding of financial and budget processes in systems of \ngovernment that follow or are modeled on United States systems is also highly desirable. \n \n4.  Working under the guidance of the Ministry of Finance, and working closely with Ministry of \nFinance staff, the budget expert will have overall responsibility for developing and implementing a \nmedium-term budget framework. Integral to this role will be the provision of training, knowledge \ntransfer, and mentoring. Specifically the budget expert will \n \n(i)  analyze current strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for improvement in the \ncurrent budget process; \n(ii)  prepare a fiscal policy framework that is consistent with the medium-term fiscal \nstrategy and includes medium-term financial estimates; \n(iii)  review the existing revenue projection model and update the model based on this \nreview and integrate the model with the budget process; \n(iv)  develop the existing Ministry of Finance budget preparation guidance materials to \nassist line ministries with budgeting over the medium term; \n(v)  prepare a budget assessment framework to enhance the capacity of the Ministry of \nFinance to analyze budget submissions; \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2009.
