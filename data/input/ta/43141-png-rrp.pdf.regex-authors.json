It  will  involve  (i) devoting  four  or  more  tranches  of  the \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to improving compliance with \nthe safety and security standards of the International Civil Aviation \nOrganization; (ii) designing and supervising airport improvements, \nand preparing and administering long-term maintenance contracts \nfor all the national airports; and (iii) monitoring the socioeconomic \nbenefits from the operating and maintenance improvements in the \nnational airports. The investment program will also work closely \nwith the capacity building program under the Transport Sector \nSupport  Program  financed  by  the  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational Development. \n   \nMultitranche Financing  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) MFF is the most suitable \nFacility  mode  of  financing  for  the  investment  program  because  it \n(i) supports the Government\u2019s long-term vision for the civil aviation \nsector,  as  outlined  in  the  current  plans  of  the  Civil  Aviation \nAuthority  (CAA);  (ii) enables  ADB  to  sustain  a  long-term \npartnership  in  building  institutional  capacity;  (iii) allows  ADB  to \nstrengthen and improve the CAA\u2019s long-term strategic plans and \nto  actively  pursue  policy  dialogue  throughout  the  investment \nprogram; (iv) allows the lessons of early tranches to be applied in \nsubsequent  tranches,  and  reforms  to  be  implemented  and \nefficiency to improve with the help of incentives; and (v) provides \ncertainty to private companies interested in pursuing long-term \nopportunities in the civil aviation sector. \n   \nRationale  Civil aviation (i) supports the socioeconomic development of the \ncountry  by  providing  safe,  efficient,  reliable,  sustainable,  and \naffordable  aviation  services  and  infrastructure;  (ii)  gives \nall-weather access to the country and increases the mobility of \n ", "ii \n \ncommunities;  and  (iii)  serves  important  community  needs  by \nmaking  noncommercial  destinations  more  accessible.  Capacity \nconstraints and deteriorating infrastructure, however, threaten the \nsafety certification of the airports and place these socioeconomic \nobjectives at risk. The CAA\u2019s well-articulated sector development \nplan  (Civil  Aviation  Authority.  2008. Strategic  Investment  Plan. \nPort Moresby) addresses the risks, but the agency needs help in \ncarrying out the plan and meeting obligations. External funding to \nrehabilitate  and  upgrade  the  national  airports  will  support  the \nGovernment\u2019s  Medium Term  Development  Strategy  (MTDS) \nobjectives  of  economic  growth,  rural  development,  poverty \nreduction, and human resource development. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The investment program will establish a sustainable civil aviation \nnetwork to support economic growth (program impact). In that \nway, it will help meet the objectives of ADB\u2019s country strategy and \nprogram, particularly those for the transport sector, and the stated \nMTDS objectives of (i) economic growth, (ii) rural development, \n(iii) poverty reduction, and (iv) human resource development. The \nintended outcome is safer, more efficient, and more accessible air \ntransport  services  in  the  project  areas  through  (i) safer  and \nmore-secure  air  travel;  (ii) better  airport  facilities; \n(iii) more-accessible markets, natural resource and mineral sites, \nand livelihood opportunities; and (iv) reduced costs of air travel to \nall project areas.  \n   \nInvestment Plan  The total cost of the investment program (including the anticipated \npublic\u2013private partnership for the international airport) is estimated \nat $640.0 million equivalent. Project 1 will comprise improvements \nin the Jackson\u2019s Domestic Airport in Port Moresby (restricted to \nthe extension of the domestic parking apron) and in the airports in \nMount Hagen, Wewak, Hoskins, and Gurney. New security fences \nwill  also  be  built  at  Goroka  and  Kavieng.  Project  1,  including \ntaxes, duties, physical and price contingencies, interest, and other \ncharges, is expected to cost about $112.0 million equivalent.

The funding will conform to ADB\u2019s policy on Innovation \nand  Efficiency  Initiative:  Pilot  Financing  Instruments  and \nModalities  (2005), and  will  come  primarily  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \n \nFunds  resources  (subject  to  availability)  and  ordinary  capital \nresources  (OCR).  The  MFF  will  comprise  several  loans, \nconditional  on  the  Government\u2019s  submission  of  the  related \n ", "iv \n \nperiodic  financing  requests,  execution  of  the  related  loan \nagreements,  and  fulfillment  of  the  terms  and  conditions  and \nunderstandings  set  forth  in  its  financing  framework  agreement \nwith ADB. The investment program will be implemented over 9 \nyears. The OCR funding will be covered by Ordinary Operations \nLoan  Regulations  applicable  to  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)\u2013based  loans,  and  the  funding  from  Special  Funds \nresources by the Special Operations Loan Regulations. In both \ncases,  any  modifications  introduced  under  the  individual  loan \nagreements will apply. The Government will provide counterpart \nfunds of $85.0 million equivalent. For project 1, the borrower will \nbe Papua New Guinea. \n \nFor project 1, the first tranche will combine three loans totaling \nabout $95 million equivalent\u2014an OCR loan of about $25 million \nand two loans from Special Funds resources totaling $70 million \nequivalent (a \u201chard-term\u201d Asian Development Fund [ADF] loan of \n$20 million  equivalent  and  a  \u201csoft-term\u201d  ADF  loan  of  about \n$50 million equivalent). The ADB loans will cover 85% of the cost \nof project 1. The first periodic financing request will be presented \nto the ADB Board of Directors together with the signed financing \nframework agreement. The Government will fund the remaining \n$17.0 million equivalent, including local taxes and duties. \n \nPeriod of Utilization  The loan utilization period will be 9 years, from 2010 to 2018, and \nthe last periodic financing request must be submitted by 2013. \nEach specific loan will have its own closing date to match its \nimplementation period. \n \nEstimated Program  31 December 2018 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Civil Aviation Authority \n   \nImplementation  The CAA will be the executing agency and will be responsible for \nArrangements  implementing  the  civil  aviation  infrastructure  works  and  the \ninstitutional strengthening and capacity building programs under \nthe  investment  program.  A  program  steering  committee  will \noversee the implementation of the investment program, monitor \nprogress, approve the airports chosen for subsequent projects, \nand guide the executing agency and the implementing agencies. \nA  project  implementation  unit  (PIU),  headed  by  the  Project \nDirector\u2013ADB  Project  (already  appointed)  and  supported  by \ninvestment  program  consultants,  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementing the sector policy and infrastructure components of \nthe  investment  program.  The  PIU  will  hire  all  consultants  and \nenter into all airport improvement contracts under the investment \nprogram.  \n   \nProcurement  All procurement to be financed under an ADB loan will conform to \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to ", "v \n \ntime).  All  contracts  over  $3  million  for  civil  works  and  over \n$0.5 million  for  goods  will  undergo  international  competitive \nbidding. Contracts below these thresholds will go through national \ncompetitive bidding and, as appropriate, minor contracts under \n$100,000 will be awarded through shopping. Advance contracting \nand retroactive financing will be used for survey works, including \ngeotechnical and other studies for the preparation of subsequent \nsubprojects.  \n   \nConsulting Services  International and national consultants will be hired for engineering \ndesign,  civil  works  supervision,  capacity  building,  advisory \nservices,  and  studies  as  appropriate.  They  will  be  recruited \nthrough  quality-  and  cost-based  selection,  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime to time). A consulting firm will be hired to provide construction \nsupervision and individual consultants to serve as PIU advisers. \nAdvance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be  used  for \nproject  analysts  participating  in  pre-feasibility  work,  including \nsurveys,  social  dimensioning  and  financial,  economic, \nenvironmental, and engineering design studies in preparation for \nsubsequent subprojects. \n   \nInvestment Program  Although  a  majority  of  the  population  will  benefit  from  having \nBenefits and  access to air transportation, the traveling public using the airports \nBeneficiaries  included in project 1 will be the immediate beneficiaries. Safer \nairports  and  more-available,  more-frequent,  more-reliable,  and \nlower-cost  transport  services  will  benefit  the  airlines  and  the \ntraveling  public  who  rely  on  them,  and  increase  travel  to  the \nproject areas. The economic benefits foreseen from safer and \nbetter-maintained  airports  are:  (i) more-varied  economic \nopportunities, higher production, and more direct sales as a result \nof better access to regional markets and towns; (ii) more sales for \nmarket vendors because of the increase in customers; (iii) better \nbusiness for trade store and industrial enterprises; and (iv) more \nopportunities  to  create  and  expand  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises.  The  anticipated  social  benefits  are:  (i) increased \nagricultural sales through the upgrading of markets near airport \nsites,  (ii) more  job  opportunities  through  required  civil  works, \n(iii) higher school enrollments and better access to health care \nthrough increased household incomes, and (iv) more opportunities \nto diversify and expand industrial and agricultural production. The \neconomic internal rate of return for project 1 is about 45%. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The major risks and assumptions are as follows. \n \nShortage of civil works contractors. The implementation of the \nproposed airport infrastructure works will be affected by the lack of \ncapable international and national contractors. The Government is \nfully aware of the issues and is responding by (i) ensuring the \nsafety  of  international  contractors  through  the  provincial \ngovernments,  (ii)  improving  the  licensing  and  classification  of \n ", "vi \n \nnational contractors, and (iii) providing opportunities to small and \nmedium-sized enterprises in the construction industry. \n \nLand acquisition and resettlement. Customary landholding in \nPNG complicates and prolongs the process of land acquisition. \nWhere required, the CAA will obtain the approval of communities \nfor improvements in airport infrastructure through memorandums \nof agreement while the formal acquisition process is fulfilled. The \ninvestment program will help the CAA to carry out field surveys \nand  prepare  land  acquisition  documents  for  all  the  airports \ncovered by the program, to enable the agency to pay for and \nacquire property for immediate use. \n \nSecurity. Security in Papua New Guinea continues to be an issue \nwith  contractors  working  on  ongoing  infrastructure  projects, \nincluding  roads.  The  CAA,  with  the  support  of  the  provincial \ngovernments, must deal with this issue. \n \nInstitutional  capacity.  The  investment  program  needs  good \ninstitutions. Strong management and governance, good planning, \nbest-practice  concepts,  sound  project  management,  fiduciary \noversight,  and  transparent  bidding  and  contract  management \nrequire not only experienced personnel but also efficient systems \nand procedures and controls. \n \nFinancing.  ADB will provide the necessary funding for capital \nexpenditure,  but  the  main  issue  in  the  long  run  will  be \nmaintenance  and  repairs.  For  this,  there  must  be  a  recurrent \nbudget allocation. Budget allocations in the past were haphazard, \nand, in the continuing economic downturn, economic and financial \nconditions  within  and  outside  the  country  could  deteriorate, \nthereby restricting growth and development. \n ", "144o  00'E 152o  00'E\nLorengau\nMomote\nF100 PAPUA NEW GUINEA\nVanimo MANUS Kavieng\n F100  F100 CIVIL AVIATION DEVELOPMENT \nAitape B I S M A R C K       S E A INVESTMENT PROGRAM\nNEW  IRELAND\nWewak\nWEST  SEPIK  F100\n4o  00'S Sepik River 4o  00'S\nKokopo\nEAST   SEPIK\nTokua\nF100\nWEST  NEW  BRITAIN\nMADANG\nWapenamDaanshd a8 ENGAWESTERNRamu River FM1a0d0ang HoFs1k00ins BFu1k0a0 AURTEOGNIOONM OOFUS\nWabag HIGHLANDS Kimbe BOUGAINVILLE\nOk Tedi Tari EAST  NEW  BRITAIN\nDash 8 Mt.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  for  Papua  New  Guinea  (PNG)  for  the  Civil  Aviation \nDevelopment Investment Program. The design and monitoring framework for the investment \nprogram is in Appendix 1. \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Civil aviation supports the socioeconomic development of the country by providing safe, \nefficient, reliable, sustainable, and affordable aviation services and infrastructure to facilitate \naccess to the country and improve the mobility of communities. Geographic difficulties impede \nroad connections in most of the country, so PNG relies instead on aviation for tourism and \nbusiness, exports and imports, domestic freight, and social cohesion. Aviation services and \ninfrastructure are essential for these activities and for access to noncommercial destinations.  \n \n3.  Two key institutions administer, regulate, and manage the civil aviation sector. The \nDepartment of Works, Transport and Civil Aviation (DWTCA) is the lead agency for transport \nstrategy and planning, including the monitoring of international obligations, the negotiation of air \nservice agreements, economic regulation, the investigation of air accidents, and sector policy \nformulation and planning. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is responsible for airports, air traffic \nmanagement, and regulatory oversight.  \n \n4.  PNG has more than 450 aviation facilities in PNG. Of these, 21 are designated national \nairports1 owned and operated by the CAA on behalf of the Government. Mostly located in \nprovincial capitals, these national airports are the focus of the proposed investment program. \nSeven can be upgraded to take larger aircraft; the rest need major rehabilitation to ensure \nsafety, security, and adequate capacity for future growth.  \n \n5.  Three  major  airlines  and  more  than  20  other  operators  provide  international  and \ndomestic services. Passenger traffic has recently grown by about 3% yearly on average, and \nfreight demand by about 1%. Both rates are well below the growth in gross domestic product, \nwhich has averaged 6.4% in recent years.  \n \n6.  Funding  for  the  civil  aviation  sector  comes  primarily  from  Department  of  Treasury \nappropriations. The DWTCA is funded entirely by the Government, and the CAA is funded by a \ncombination of revenues from airport and airspace fees and charges, licensing and regulatory \nfees, and annual government appropriations. An analysis of the sector is in Appendix 2. \n                                                 \n1  Buka,  Chimbu,  Daru,  Goroka,  Gurney,  Hoskins,  Kavieng,  Kerema,  Kiunga,  Madang,  Mendi,  Momote, \nMount Hagen, Nadzab (Lae), Popendetta, Port Moresby, Tari, Tokua, Vanimo, Wapenamanda, and Wewak. \n ", "2   \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n  1.  Challenges \n7.  Facilities. The national airports typically have (i) low compliance with safety and security \nstandards, creating risks of accidents and illegal movements of people and goods; (ii) air-side \npavements,  terminal  buildings,  equipment,  and  utilities  in  poor  condition;  (iii)   swiftly \ndeteriorating pavements; and (iv)  inadequate maintenance. Air navigation systems in PNG are \nunreliable and deteriorating because of (i) old and obsolete equipment, (ii) lack of spare parts, \n(iii) theft and vandalism, (iv) unreliable power and communications, and (v) logistics problems. \n \n8.  Impact on operations. Poor infrastructure and air navigation services lead to (i) flight \ncancellations, (ii) restricted operations, (iii) higher costs to airlines because of reduced payload \nand the need to divert flights, and (iv) higher costs to public and private business because of \nflight cancellations, rescheduling, and diversions. Airlines face the risk of airport closures and, \nbecause they cannot invest in future aircraft types, may have to reduce capacity into important \ntourism and economic regions, thereby constraining economic and social development. \n \n9.  Institutions. The aviation sector is facing institutional capacity issues at many levels. \nThe Government\u2019s aviation strategies are demanding, but it has insufficient skills and depth of \nexperience in all the delivery areas of policy and sector reforms to implement them successfully. \nThe  CAA  is  restructuring,  but  a  key  issue  in  the  transition  is  functional  capacity  to  meet \nexpected outcomes. Besides the operating units that are being created, an important aspect will \nbe divesting regulatory oversight, to eliminate conflicts of interest with operating responsibilities.  \n \n10.  Policy and strategy. The Government\u2019s transport policies call for (i) safety and security \nimprovements, (ii) better maintenance, (iii) upgraded national airports, (iv) an upgraded air traffic \nmanagement  system,  and  (v) sector-wide  policy  initiatives.  Coordination  and  collaboration \nbetween the policy functions of DWTCA and the business and service delivery functions of the \nrestructured CAA must improve. \n \n11.  Finance. To finance airport compliance and cater for growth, the CAA relies on a \ncombination  of  airport  and  airspace  fees,  licensing  and  regulatory  fees,  and  annual \nappropriations from the Government derived from its community service obligation (CSO) policy. \nHowever, the Government\u2019s competing priorities for funds and fiscal strategies have resulted in \nsignificant underfunding of the CAA for many years. Furthermore, institutional problems have \nreduced the CAA\u2019s own capacity to fund safety and security maintenance, upgrades to meet \npresent and future airport needs, and regulatory oversight of safety and security. Although the \ninternational airport and a few others may recover operating costs, most national airports are \nnot commercially viable and are a drag on the CAA\u2019s annual financial performance and ability to \nfund investment. The CSO grants from the Government cover some of the shortfall, but the CAA \nneeds external funding to meet all of its obligations and execute its strategic plan.  \n  2.  Government\u2019s Strategy and Ongoing Efforts \n12.  The  Government\u2019s  transport  policies  are  the  Medium Term  Development  Strategy \n(MTDS) 2005\u20132010 and the more detailed National Transport Development Plan (NTDP) 2006\u2013\n2010. These documents contain the overall policies, objectives, and actions that guide the \ndevelopment and operation of the transport sector. Both are undergoing review, with completion \nexpected within 2009. ", "3 \n \n13.  MTDS 2005\u20132010 has seven priorities, including the \u201crehabilitation and maintenance of \ntransport  infrastructure.\u201d  The  NTDP  2006\u20132010  vision  for  the  aviation  sector  involves \n(i) competition on domestic routes and access to these routes by foreign airlines as part of the \nlong-term upgrading plan for selected airports with international flight facilities; (ii) larger aircraft \noperating in major national airports; (iii) accessible, safe, reliable, efficient, and affordable air \ntransport; (iv) improved and reasonably priced international services to establish PNG as a \ngateway between continents; and (v) lower-cost and safer passenger and cargo movements. \nThe NTDP proposes major investments at six national airports (Gurney, Madang, Mount Hagen, \nNadzab, Tokua, and Wewak) to facilitate growth and eventual competition on domestic routes. It \nalso mandates the provision of services to all national airports, and government grants to meet \nthe CAA\u2019s revenue shortfall. \n \n14.  To fulfill these priorities, the Government, through the National Executive Committee, \nhas endorsed the CAA\u2019s Infrastructure Investment Plan\u2013Long Term (2010\u20132030) as its sector \nplan. Certification, rehabilitation of national airports, and upgrading of six major national airports \nwill require a total investment of K1.710 billion ($547.6 million). Details of the plan are given in \nAppendix 2. \n \n15.  A key objective of NTDP 2006\u20132010 is to reform the CAA to become self-sufficient and \nfund much of the remedial maintenance of airports and airways. The CAA strategic plan is in \nline with the MTDS and NTDP policies and priorities. The key objectives of the plan are (i) to \nattend to critical safety and security needs and implement structural reform (short term), (ii) to \nfacilitate economic and social development through sustainable aviation infrastructure (medium \nterm), and (iii) to realize an acceptable rate of return on investments (long term). \n  3.  ADB\u2019s Strategy \n16.  ADB\u2019s country assistance strategy2 supports the implementation of MTDS 2005\u22122010 \nby tightening the focus of ADB\u2019s program for maximum impact in priority areas. The transport \nsector is one of four main strategic areas of ADB engagement, building on ADB\u2019s comparative \nadvantage and its long-standing relationships with other development partners. The investment \nprogram  will  draw  on  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  preparing  and  implementing  small  airport \nimprovement projects associated with regional and domestic airport development, particularly \nwhere rugged terrain makes air travel an important mode of transport. The project is included in \nthe updated COBP 2009\u20132011.3  \n \n17.  Since external assistance is now directed mainly at capacity development, ADB efforts \nwill center on the necessary infrastructure improvements, with targeted assistance to fill gaps in \ninstitutional development and support the restructuring of the CAA, in coordination with technical \nassistance from the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) (see para. 32). \nThe sector road map and policy framework is in Appendix 3. \n \n18.  The proposed investment program will cover (i) the infrastructure needed to comply with \nthe  safety  and  security  standards  of  the  International  Civil  Aviation  Organization  (ICAO); \n(ii) remedial maintenance on air-side pavements and infrastructure to allow national airports to \n                                                 \n2   ADB. 2006.

External Assistance \n19.  Most external assistance to PNG so far has come from AusAID, which has funded \nstrategic  studies,  the  services  of  specialist  advisers  to  Government,  small  infrastructure \nprojects, and the procurement of equipment. About $10 million will be made available in these \nareas  over  the  next  3  years  under  AusAID\u2019s  ongoing  Transport  Sector  Support  Program \n(TSSP). There have been no significant investments in the sector from other external sources. \nADB\u2019s current advisory assistance to the Government in the establishment of a public\u2013private \npartnership framework could lead to private sector involvement at the Port Moresby international \nairport, but is still at a very early stage and will not affect the rest of the sector development \nplan.  \n  5.  Lessons \n20.  A key lesson from past performance in the sector is the importance of maximizing the \nrecovery of operating costs, to allow the CAA to fund recurrent maintenance costs, avoid the \ncostly  cycle  of  deterioration  and  rehabilitation,  and  ensure  continuous  safety  and  security \ncertification. By eliminating capacity constraints, investment can facilitate economic growth and \na commensurate increase in traffic that will allow prudent operating expenditure to help achieve \nthis objective. The restructuring of the CAA can also help to update and rationalize fees and link \nthem to the demand created by expanded services. \n \n21.  Another key lesson is the importance of meeting the Government\u2019s commitment to \nmaintain facilities that cannot achieve full commercial cost recovery but satisfy its obligations to \nthe community. NTDP 2006\u20132010 sets a target of 75% of operating costs to be met through \ngrants to the CAA; this figure should gradually reduce as traffic increases and tariffs (landing \nfees and terminal charges) are reviewed and updated. External support should be conditional \non adherence to this commitment, with appropriate modifications in light of the investment \nprogram.  \n \n22.  A third key lesson is the importance of developing efficient and effective institutional \nstructures,  carefully  sequencing  their  implementation,  and  providing  long-term  support  and \ncapacity development in putting the sector road map into effect. The implementation of the \nGovernment\u2019s  policies  and  strategies  is  very  demanding  and  involves  the  successful \ncoordination of many stakeholders, but a resource gap in experienced and qualified staff in the \nCAA is holding back the Government from meeting its objectives. Operating and regulatory \nfunctions housed in the same institution are also creating conflicts of interest. Continuous \nsupport for institutional development and for program monitoring and evaluation through the \ninvestment program (made possible by the long-term nature of an MFF) should be delivered \nthrough government systems and coordinated carefully with other external assistance.  \n  6.  Rationale for ADB Support \n23.  Program rationale. Civil aviation (i) supports the social and economic development of \nthe country by providing safe, efficient, reliable, sustainable, and affordable aviation services ", "5 \nand infrastructure; (ii) gives all-weather access to the country and improves the mobility of \ncommunities;  and  (iii)  provides  access  to  noncommercial  destinations,  thereby  meeting \nimportant  service  obligations  to  the  community.  Capacity  constraints  and  deteriorating \ninfrastructure, however, threaten the safety and security certification of airports and place these \nobjectives at risk. The CAA has a well-articulated sector development plan4 for dealing with the \nrisks but requires support to carry out the plan and meet its obligations. External funding to \nrehabilitate and upgrade the national airports and support their certification will advance the \nMTDS 2005\u20132010 objectives of economic growth, rural development, poverty reduction, and \nhuman resource development. Without the improvements, PNG\u2019s recent rapid economic growth \nmay stall. \n \n24.  Multitranche  financing  facility.    ADB\u2019s  multitranche  financing  facility  is  the  most \nsuitable mode of financing for the investment program because it (i) supports the Government\u2019s \nlong-term vision for the civil aviation sector, as outlined in the CAA\u2019s current plans; (ii) enables \nADB to sustain the long-term partnership that is needed to build institutional capacity; (iii) allows \nADB to strengthen and improve CAA\u2019s long term strategic plans and to actively pursue policy \ndialogue throughout the investment program; (iv) allows the lessons of early tranches to be \napplied in subsequent tranches, and reforms to be implemented and efficiency to improve with \nthe help of incentives; and (v) provides certainty to private companies interested in pursuing \nlong-term opportunities in the civil aviation sector. ADB\u2019s sector development program modality \nis not suitable because of the commitment charges that would be levied on the Government \nand,  from  previous  project  experience  in  PNG,  the  generally  slow  progress  in  physical \nimplementation. With the MFF facility, the Government and the CAA will be able to implement \nprojects with financing certainty matched with realistic implementation timetables. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n25.  The investment program will establish a sustainable civil aviation network to support the \neconomic growth of the country. In that way, it will help meet the objectives of ADB\u2019s country \nstrategy and program,5 particularly those for the transport sector, and the Government\u2019s MTDS \nobjectives of (i) economic growth, (ii) rural development, (iii) poverty reduction, and (iv) human \nresource development.  \n \n26.  The investment program will result in safer, more-secure, and more-efficient all-weather \naccess to air transport services in the project areas through (i) better airport facilities; (ii) safer \nand more-secure air travel; (iii) more-accessible markets, natural resource and mineral sites, \nand livelihood opportunities; and (iv) reduced costs of air travel to all the project areas. It will \nhelp achieve the Government\u2019s goal of securing and maintaining ICAO certification for the \nsafety and security standards at its airport operations and facilities. \nB.  Outputs \n27.  The investment program will concentrate first of all on carrying out priority actions to \ncomply with ICAO security and safety standards, and then on increasing capacity for growth in \n                                                 \n4  Civil Aviation Authority. 2008. Strategic Investment Plan. Port Moresby.  \n5  ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program (2006\u20132010): Papua New Guinea. Manila.  \n ", "6   \nservices. The outputs will be as follows: (i) rehabilitated airport infrastructure, including runways, \ntaxiways, and aprons; (ii) upgraded runways and passenger terminals that can accommodate \nlarger  aircraft;  (iii)  communication,  navigation,  surveillance,  and  firefighting  equipment; \n(iv) better maintained facilities; and (v) an institutionally strengthened and reformed CAA and its \noperational units. The inputs will comprise financing for civil works and consulting services in \nprogram  administration,  construction  supervision,  and  support  for  the  ongoing  institutional \nreforms. \n \n28.  The five airports covered by project 1 are the top priorities in the CAA\u2019s strategic plan. \nThey serve about 1.5 million people, and economic analysis indicates that they are performing \nwell. The Jackson airport is the country\u2019s main airport, with international connections, and the \nhub for all national airports. The Mount Hagen airport is the major airport in the Highlands \nregion, providing access to the four major provinces (Chimbu, Enga, Southern Highlands, and \nWestern Highlands provinces), the country\u2019s major coffee-growing and mineral resource\u2013based \neconomies. The Hoskins airport is the major airport for West New Britain and serves a major \nisland economy that specializes in oil palm production. Wewak, the provincial capital of East \nSepik, is the major town between Madang and Jayapura (Indonesia). It is a major coastal \neconomy on the northern side of the mainland specializing in timber and natural resources. The \nGurney airport provides connections with Alotau, the provincial capital of Milne Bay province, \nand  access  to  tourist  destinations  along  the  country\u2019s  lower-eastern  coastline; a  direct  air \ntransport link with Cairns, Australia, is planned. There were about 37,000 aircraft movements at \nthe Jackson airport in 2008 and 15,000 at the Mount Hagen airport, and 1.0 million passengers \nin Jackson and 113,000 in Mount Hagen. In the same year, the airports in Gurney, Hoskins, and \nWewak, averaged 3,000 aircraft movements and 32,000 passengers.  \n \n29.  Project 1. The first tranche will finance the following, under project 1: (i) improvements \nin pavements and fencing identified as requiring emergency works to comply with ICAO safety \nand security standards; (ii) support for (a) engineering design, preparation of bid documents, \nand procurement by the CAA; and (b) preparation by the CAA of investment proposals for \nsubsequent projects and tranches for ADB approval; and (iii) consulting services to CAA for the \nsupervision of (a) airport improvement contracts for the five project 1 airports, and (b) long-term \nmaintenance contracts for these five airports. In addition to the five airports, two others (Kavieng \nand Goroka) will have new security fences installed. \n \n30.  At the end of the program, (i) 21 national airports will be in compliance with ICAO \nsecurity and safety standards, (ii) modern communication and navigation equipment will be \nproviding enhanced services and generating additional revenue for flight information region \noperations and for safe landing and takeoff, (iii) the CAA and its subsidiary operations will have \nimproved their capacity to operate and maintain the civil aviation sector, and (iv) cost recovery \nand sustainability policies will have been implemented throughout the civil aviation sector. \nC.  Special Features \n31.  Long-term  maintenance  contracts.  Long-term  maintenance  contracts  will  be  an \nintegral component of the investment program. For the 21 national airports covered by the \nprogram, facilities will be upgraded and maintenance improved to a specified standard under \ncivil works contracts for a contract period of 10 years. The maintenance contracts will be \nperformance  based,  with  fixed  monthly  payments  contingent  on  meeting  the  performance \nstandards, and defined penalties for underperformance. The maintenance contracts may be \n\u201cunit  rate\u201d  contracts  to  start  with  and  convertible  after  2  years  into  \u201cperformance-based\u201d ", "7 \ncontracts in compliance with ICAO standards. To ensure proper funding, tariffs reviews will take \noperation and maintenance requirements into consideration, and passenger terminal fees at the \nnational airports will be adjusted to match the need for terminal and infrastructure maintenance. \n \n32.  Institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  development.  DWTCA  is  still  gaining \ncapacity for effective policy coordination, and CAA is still developing the structure, experience, \nand expertise to deliver efficient services and facilities. To ensure adequate capacity for policy \nplanning, coordination, and implementation, ADB will collaborate closely with the TSSP. The \nTSSP is a technical assistance initiative supported by AusAID that supplies both long-term and \nshort-term advisers in policy development and administration. ADB will provide implementation \nand  capacity  development  assistance  in  specialized  areas  related  to  the  delivery  of  the \ninvestment program. On the policy planning and coordination side, ADB is supporting a review \nof  NTDP 2006\u20132010,  while  the  TSSP  is  supporting  the  preparation  of  the  new  long-term \nNational Transport Strategy, Medium Term Transport Plan, and National Airports Strategic \nManagement Plan. On the implementation side, ADB will continuously support the CAA in \ncorporate  strategy  formulation,  project  development  and  management,  and  sustainable \nmaintenance contracting, even as the TSSP supports advisers in financial management, human \nresource development and training, information technology, asset management, and safety \nmanagement. This collaboration will allow all stakeholders to make the best use of the available \nassistance  for  greater  complementarity.  ADB\u2019s  long-term,  continuous  support  through  the \nprogram will build ownership, develop local capacity, and strengthen government systems to \nestablish better control. \n \n33.  Regional cooperation. To sustain the safety and security improvements in the airports \nand PNG compliance with ICAO standards, the investment program will facilitate assistance \nfrom  the  Pacific  Aviation  Safety  Office  (PASO).  PASO  is  a  regional  intergovernmental \norganization formed with ADB loan support6 to provide aviation audit services to ADB member \ncountries including PNG. PASO inspectors are expected to conduct yearly audits of airport \nsafety and security according to an approved work program that has been negotiated with the \nCAA. PASO also conducts training in this area with a view to the progressive takeover of \nresponsibilities by the planned independent safety regulator. \n \n34.  Private sector participation. The civil aviation network contributes significantly to the \nprivate sector involved in gold mining, oil and gas and other mineral production, and coffee \ngrowing and processing. Improved safety at airports, greater accessibility, and lower transport \ncosts will therefore benefit the private sector immensely. As part of the ongoing institutional \nrestructuring, CAA is being encouraged to operate on a commercial basis, charging its users \nand maintaining the network. To this end, CAA is undertaking an internal review, using its own \nresources, to help identify and better understand its cost structure and cost trends for the \nnational airports. It will use this information in future studies to attract private sector participation \nand equitable tariff structures in the civil aviation sector. Arrangements are in place for a study \n(commenced in October 2009) of a possible partnership between CAA and the private sector in \nfunding the operation and maintenance of Jackson\u2019s airport. The study is to be completed by \nFebruary 2010. The investment program will center on the immediate high-priority safety and \nsecurity requirements for compliance with ICAO standards and will not be affected by the \noutcome of the Jackson\u2019s airport study. ADB will also explore opportunities for cofinancing the \nother national airports with other aid agencies including AusAID. \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2005.

NTDP  2006\u20132010  provides  the  overall  policy \nframework for airports and air transport, and the CAA\u2019s Long Term Investment Plan (LTIP) \n2010\u20132030 provides the sector plan. Several initiatives have been taken by the Government \nand development partners to communicate these policies and supplement them with strategies \nfor implementation. Appendix 3 gives the status of implementation of the civil aviation policies \nand  the  support  they  will  receive  from  the  investment  program.  The  financing  framework \nagreement (FFA) between PNG and ADB will set out the policy framework for the proposed \nprojects under the MFF, which will be guided by NTDP 2006\u20132010 and LTIP 2010\u20132030. \n \n36.  Subsequent  subprojects  under  the  investment  program  will  be  closely  aligned  with \nNTDP  2011\u20132020,  which  the  Government  is  now  preparing  and  which  is  expected  to \nincorporate the policy framework in Appendix 3. CAA is also preparing the National Airports \nStrategic  Management  Plan  (NASMP)  2008\u20132018,  documenting  its  approach  to  the  future \nmanagement of operating improvements in PNG\u2019s national airports and setting up cost recovery \nmodels  for  the  sustainability  of  airports  supporting  other  modes  of  transport  to  facilitate \neconomic development. The NASMP is to be completed by the end of 2009. \n \n37.  Project  implementation.  In  view  of  the  rapid  deterioration  of  airport  pavement \nstructures and the need to keep the airports in operation, the CAA and the Government have \ncreated and staffed the project implementation unit (PIU) to help ADB process the proposed \nlending facility. The Papua New Guinea Resident Mission (PNRM) of ADB led the preparation of \nthe investment program by assembling a team of international experts and by interacting daily \nwith the PIU counterpart team members in the following areas: (i) civil aviation engineering, \n(ii) social development, (iii) environment, (iv) financial analysis, and (v) economic analysis. The \nPIU, with guidance from PNRM, has begun advance action in the preparation of procurement \ndocuments for (i) the parking apron at Jackson\u2019s domestic airport, (ii) instrument landing system \nequipment for Jackson\u2019s airport, (iii) security fencing for five domestic airports, and (iv) a review \nof the feasibility study of Vanimo domestic airport, on which the preparation of subsequent \nprojects under the MFF tranches will be based. This implementation assistance, in coordination \nwith the TSSP, will provide adequate capacity to implement a larger program than CAA has so \nfar carried out. \nD.  Investment Plan \n38.  Investment  plan.  The  investment  program  (including  the  anticipated  public\u2013private \npartnership  for  the  international  airport)  will  cost  an  estimated  $640.0  million  equivalent. \nProject 1, including taxes, duties, physical and price contingencies, interest, and other charges, \nwill cost about $112.0 million equivalent. The cost estimates are summarized in Table 1 and \ngiven in detail in Appendix 4 (for the investment program) and Appendix 5 (for project 1).

Indicative road map. The investment program mirrors the road map for assistance to \nthe  civil  aviation  sector  in  dealing  with  such  sector  constraints  as  physical  infrastructure \n(deteriorating air-side and land-side infrastructure), sector policy shortcomings (no policy on \nsocial safety obligations, noncompliance with ICAO safety and security requirements, etc.), and \ncapacity building requirements. An indicative plan for tranche releases (Appendix 4) shows five \nairports in project 1 (Jackson\u2019s domestic airport, Mount Hagen, Wewak, Hoskins, and Gurney), \nfive more airports in tranche 2 (Nadzab, Madang, Kavieng, Goroka, and Tokua) in 2011, and the \nrest of the airports in 2012 through 2013. The sequencing of project airports takes into account \nthe priority safety requirements associated with the repairs in airport pavements to meet the \nsafety requirements of aircraft of Air Niugini and other airlines. In sector policy reform, the \ninvestment program will focus on separating the operating and regulatory functions of the CAA, \nreviewing and revising civil aviation charges, and restructuring CAA into separate legal entities \nrepresenting  functional  responsibilities  (a  timetable  for  the  policy  reform  targets  is  in \nAppendix 1).  As  part  of  the  FFA, trigger  points  regarding  compliance  with  ADB  safeguard \npolicies, implementation of agreed policy reforms, advance procurement actions, government \napproval clearances, progress in the implementation of ongoing subprojects, etc., will be agreed \non with the Government and the CAA before subsequent MFF tranche releases are approved. \nAppendix 6 lists potential airports for subsequent projects and the criteria used in their selection. \nE.

Multitranche financing facility: amount and terms. The proposal calls for ADB to \nprovide up to $480 million equivalent through the MFF to help fund the investment program. The \nfunding  will  conform  to  ADB\u2019s  policy,7 and  will  come  primarily  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \n \nresources (subject to availability, as described in para. 46 below); supplemental funding will \ncome from ordinary capital resources (OCR). The MFF will comprise several loans, conditional \non the Government\u2019s submission of the related periodic financing requests (PFRs), execution of \nthe related loan agreements, and fulfillment of the terms and conditions and understandings set \nforth in its FFA with ADB. The investment program will be implemented over 9 years. The OCR \nfunding  will  be  covered  by  Ordinary  Operations  Loan  Regulations  that  apply  to  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)\u2013based loans, and the funding from Special Funds resources \nSpecial Operations Loan Regulations. In both cases, any modifications introduced under the \nindividual loan agreements will apply. The Government will provide counterpart funding of $85.0 \nmillion equivalent, including all local taxes and duties. In addition, ADB will explore and pursue \nviable  cofinancing  opportunities  (with  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  Korean \nEXIM Bank, European Investment Bank, etc.) during the implementation of the investment \nprogram and the preparation of subsequent tranches. The grant component will be at least 35% \nof the MFF, in compliance with the Government\u2019s Medium Term Debt Strategy for 2009\u20132013. \nADB\u2019s analysis of the sustainability of PNG\u2019s external debt shows that PNG will remain at \nmoderate risk of external debt distress over the medium term after the four project tranches of \nthe investment program. External debt burden indicators will be well below their indicative \nthresholds under the baseline scenario, but some vulnerability to further terms-of-trade shocks \nand slower economic growth will also continue. \n \n42.  In accordance with the FFA, the Government\u2019s first PFR for project 1 will cover a blend \nof three ADB loans totaling about $95 million equivalent to help finance project 1\u2014an OCR loan \nof about $25 million and two loans from Special Funds resources totaling $70 million equivalent \n(a \u201chard-term\u201d Asian Development Fund [ADF] loan of $20 million equivalent and a \u201csoft-term\u201d \nADF loan of about $50 million equivalent). The ADB loans will finance 85% of the total cost of \nproject 1.  \n \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2005.

OCR loans carry a term of 25 years, including a grace period of about 5 years, an \ninterest rate in line with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a yearly commitment charge of \n0.15%, and other terms and conditions stated in the loan agreement. \n \n44.  \u201cHard-term\u201d loans from Special Funds resources normally carry a term of 32 years, \nincluding a grace period of up to 8 years, interest of 1.6% per year, and other terms and \nconditions set forth in the loan agreement. \n \n45.  \u201cSoft-term\u201d loans from Special Funds resources have a term of 32 years, including a \ngrace period of up to 8 years, yearly interest of 1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% \nthereafter, and other terms and conditions stated in the loan agreement. \n \n46.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that  the  allocation  of  ADF  for  the  second  and \nsubsequent tranches will be subject to (i) the general availability of ADF resources, (ii) PNG\u2019s \naccess to such resources under ADB\u2019s Graduation Policy8 and the requirements of the ADF \ndonors,  and  (iii)  the  availability  of  such  resources  to  PNG  under  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nPerformance-Based Allocation for Asian Development Fund Resources.9  \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n  1.  Investment Program Monitoring and Project Management \n47.  The CAA will be the executing agency and will be responsible for implementing the civil \naviation infrastructure works and the institutional strengthening and capacity building programs \nunder the investment program. A program steering committee will oversee the implementation \nof the investment program, monitor progress, approve the airports selected for subsequent \nprojects, and guide the CAA and the implementing agencies. The program steering committee \nwill be chaired by the CEO of CAA and members will have representatives from the Papua New \nGuinea Air Services Ltd. (PNGASL), the Department of Treasury, the Department of National \nPlanning and Monitoring, the Department of Transport, ADB PNG Resident Mission, Air Niugini \nAirlines, and civil aviation stakeholder organizations as members. The committee will meet at \nleast once each quarter. \n \n48.  A  PIU,  headed  by  the  director\u2013ADB  Project  (already  appointed)  and  supported  by \ninvestment program consultants, will be responsible for implementing the sector policy and \ninfrastructure components of the program. It will hire all consultants and enter into airport \nimprovement contracts under the program. The current PIU national staff combines skills in civil \nengineering, aviation equipment engineering, financial accounting, economics, environmental \nmanagement, and procurement. The PIU is now engaged in advance bid document preparation \nfor the following: (i) extension of the domestic parking bay at Jackson\u2019s airport; (ii) acquisition of \ninstrument landing system equipment for Jackson\u2019s airport; (iii) security airport fencing for the \nGoroka, Gurney, Hoskins, Kavieng, and Wewak airports; and (iv) topographic and geotechnical \nsurveys. The bidding is expected to be substantially completed by December 2009. The early \nestablishment of the PIU will allow the national counterpart staff to gain enough technical skills \nto prepare subsequent subprojects much earlier than in the past. In addition, the Papua New \nGuinea Resident Mission of ADB will continuously assist and guide the PIU in complying with \nADB procurement procedures and practices. \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2007.

Preparation of Project 1 and Subsequent Projects \n49.  The investment program will follow the MFF implementation procedures. For project 1, \nthe support consultants will assist CAA in detailed engineering, bid document preparation, \nenvironment  and  resettlement  planning,  tendering,  and  contract  award.  All  resettlement \nactivities will be completed before the start of civil works. For subsequent projects, the CAA, \nwith the assistance of the consultants, will (i) select the project airports on the basis of the \nagreed  selection  criteria  (Appendix  6);  (ii)  prepare  the  project  report,  including  technical, \neconomic, environmental, and social assessments; and (iii) prepare a PFR for each airport. The \nproject report will conform to the criteria and procedures stated in the FFA, and other related \nrequirements  of  the  Government  and  ADB.  After  appraising  the  technical,  financial,  and \neconomic feasibility of each project and compliance with safeguard requirements, the CAA will \nsubmit  to  ADB,  through  the  Department  of  National  Planning  and  Monitoring,  a  summary \nappraisal report in the format specified in the investment program administration memorandum \nand the draft PFR. ADB will undertake due diligence according to its relevant policies and \nprocedures, and approve the CAA\u2019s appraisal, subject to any amendments. If required by ADB, \nthe CAA will amend the PFR and submit it to ADB for approval by its due date.  \n  3.  Implementation Period \n50.  The  investment  program  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  9  years  until \nDecember 2018. Project 1 is expected to be completed by 2012. CAA will prepare detailed \nimplementation schedules for the subsequent projects. An indicative implementation plan for the \ninvestment program and a detailed implementation schedule for project 1 are in Appendix 7. \n  4.  Procurement \n51.  All procurement to be financed under an ADB loan will conform to ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). All contracts over $3 million for civil works \nand over $0.5 million for goods will undergo international competitive bidding. Contracts below \nthese  thresholds  will  go  through  national  competitive  bidding  and,  as  appropriate,  minor \ncontracts below $100,000 will be awarded through shopping. (The procurement plan is in \nAppendix 8.) A procurement capacity assessment has concluded that procurement activities \nassociated with the investment program can use the CAA\u2019s existing procurement systems and \nprocedures. \n  5.  Consulting Services \n52.  International and national consultants will be hired for engineering design, civil works \nsupervision,  capacity  building,  financial  accounting,  advisory  services,  and  studies  as \nappropriate. The consultants will be recruited through quality and cost-based selection (at the \nstandard 80:20 ratio) in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). A consulting firm will be recruited to carry out detailed design and \nconstruction supervision, and individual consultants to serve as PIU advisers. \n \n53.  Project  1  will  require  a  total  of  1,000  person-months  of  consulting  services \n(357 international  and  643  national).  (Outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  services  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix A.) Additional consulting services, if necessary, will be procured under \nsubsequent projects. The consulting services will be financed from the ADB loans.  ", "13 \n  6.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n54.  ADB Management has approved advance contracting and retroactive financing for the \ninvestment program and for project 1 preparation. Advance contracting will be used for the \npre-feasibility  work  of  project  analysts  including  survey  works  (geotechnical  studies  and \ntopography),  social  dimensioning,  and  financial,  economic,  environmental,  and  engineering \ndesign preparation for subsequent subprojects. Retroactive financing for the PFRs under the \nMFF will be limited to 20% of the proceeds of the individual loans under the MFF, provided that \nexpenditures comply with the agreed procedures and are made within the 12 months before the \nsigning of the pertinent loan agreement under the MFF. Retroactive financing will be restricted \nto eligible expenditures\u2014seminars on business opportunities, PIU incremental costs including \nproject officers\u2019 remuneration, office equipment, surveys, consulting services, and civil works. \nThe Government and the CAA have been informed that the approval of advance procurement \naction and retroactive financing does not in any way commit ADB to finance the subprojects. As \npart  of  advance  procurement,  the  CAA\u2019s  PIU  team  will  have  substantially  completed  the \nprequalification and bidding exercises for the Jackson\u2019s airport (surveys, extension of parking \naprons for domestic operations, and procurement of air navigation equipment) and the security \nfences at most of the airports covered by project 1 before the investment program is considered \nby the ADB Board of Directors.  \n  7.  Investment Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n55.  Targets  and  indicators  for  monitoring  and  evaluating  the  investment  program \nperformance have been discussed with the CAA, and the key targets and indicators have been \nincluded in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). The consultants for program \nimplementation support will work with the CAA to collect data from relevant agencies, including \nprovincial  governments  and  stakeholders,  for  use  in  measuring  performance  against  the \nindicators at inception, 3 years after each project, and at the end of the investment program. \nThe CAA, with the assistance of the supervision consultant, will monitor and evaluate the impact \nof  the  investment  program  to  ensure  that  the  completed  infrastructure  is  being  managed \neffectively and the benefits are maximized. ADB Management will prepare periodic reports on \noverall progress to the Board. \n  8.  Governance and Anticorruption Measures \n56.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the projects under the investment \nprogram. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy will be \nincluded  in  the  loan  agreements  and  bidding  documents  for  the  investment  program.  In \nparticular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the investment program shall include \nprovisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of CAA \nand  its  subsidiary  entities,  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service \nproviders as they relate to the investment program. \n \n ", "14   \n57.  The  investment  program  will  be  implemented  as  far  as  possible  through  existing \ninstitutions and country systems. As required by ADB,10 a governance risk assessment and \nmanagement plan (GRAMP) (Supplementary Appendix B) put together during the preparation of \nthe investment program identified the risks and associated mitigating actions, and these were \ndiscussed  with  the  Government.  Three  thematic  areas\u2014public  financial  management, \nprocurement, and anticorruption measures\u2014were assessed for significant risks. The following \ngovernance safeguards will mitigate the risk of misuse of funds and improve governance, \naccountability, and transparency, according to the GRAMP: (i) the disclosure of updated and \ndetailed information on project implementation on the CAA website; (ii) the timely disclosure of \ninformation on the selection of consultants and contractors in local newspapers and on the \nwebsite; (iii) the dissemination to the public of such information as the service expected from \nperformance-based contracts; (iv) compliance with ADB procurement rules; (v) independent \nverification of the quantity, quality, and costs of works by an international supervising consultant \n(or equivalent); (vi) comprehensive accounting support to ensure, among other things, timely \nand  rigorous  reconciliation,  orderly  record  keeping,  and  strict  adherence  to  financial \nmanagement  policies  and  internal  controls;  (vii)  independent  external  auditing  of  financial \nstatements and, where appropriate, contracts and project accounts; (viii) supervision by ADB \nand other funding agencies; and (ix) forensic audits of alleged cases of corruption. \n  9.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n58.  The CAA has agreed to adhere to sound financial management requirements while \nimplementing the investment program. It will prepare annual financial statements on an accrual \naccounting basis and in accordance with international financing reporting standards, and will \nmaintain separate and adequate project records and accounts to identify (i) the goods and \nservices financed from the loan proceeds, (ii) the financing resources received, (iii) expenditures \nincurred on the components of each project, and (iv) counterpart and cofinancing funds received \nand spent. The agency will hire independent external auditors acceptable to ADB to audit the \nconsolidated project accounts, including counterpart funds, yearly. It will submit to ADB certified \ncopies of the audited accounts, as well as the auditor\u2019s report, in English within 6 months of the \nend of each financial year during the implementation period. CAA has been advised that ADB \nrequires the timely submission of the audited project accounts and financial statements, and \nthat it may suspend the disbursement of ADB loans if the requirement is not complied with. \n \n59.  The  CAA  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  progress  reports  on  individual \nprojects, including (i) a narrative description of progress made during the reporting period, \n(ii) changes  in  the  implementation  schedule,  (iii)  problems  or  difficulties  encountered,  and \n(iv) activities to be undertaken in the next reporting period. The CAA will also prepare and \nsubmit to ADB a project completion report within 3 months of the completion of each project, \nand an investment program completion report after the completion of all projects under the \ninvestment program. \n  10.  Disbursement Arrangements \n60.  The loan proceeds will be disbursed according to ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007, as amended from time to time) until 30 June 2019. Direct payment procedures will \ngenerally be used for airport improvement civil works and consulting services contracts. The \n                                                 \n10 Applicable policies and guidelines include: (i) ADB. 2006. Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan. \nManila; and (ii) ADB. 2008. Guidelines for Implementing ADB\u2019s Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan \n(GACAP II). Manila (May). ", "15 \nCAA will maintain separate bank accounts for government counterpart funds for project 1 and \nseparate accounting records for subsequent project loans, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements agreed on by the Government and ADB.  \n  11.  Reviews \n61.  ADB will field inception missions within 3 months of the approval of the loan(s) for each \nproject, and at least two review missions a year. The Government and ADB will jointly undertake \na midterm review of project 1 within 2 years of its start and a midterm review of the investment \nprogram by 2014. The timing of the midterm reviews of subsequent projects will be agreed on \nduring the appraisal of each project. The midterm reviews will center on (i) program impact, \n(ii) implementation progress, (iii) progress with the policy framework, (iv) the performance of \nconsultants and contractors, (v) the status of compliance with undertakings in the FFA and \ncovenants in the individual loan agreements, and (vi) the need for any midcourse changes in the \nscope or schedule of the investment program to achieve its full impact. \nIV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACT, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits \n62.  Although a majority of the country\u2019s population will benefit from having access to air \ntransportation, the traveling public using the airports included in project 1 will be the immediate \nbeneficiaries. Safer and better-maintained airports will increase the availability, frequency, and \nreliability of transport services and lower their cost, to the benefit of the airlines and the traveling \npublic, and result in travel to the project areas. Among the anticipated economic benefits are \n(i) more diverse economic opportunities, higher production, and more direct sales as a result of \nbetter access to regional markets and towns; (ii) more sales for market vendors because of the \nincrease in customers; (iii) better business for hospitality, trade store, and industrial enterprises; \nand (iv) more opportunities to create and expand small and medium-sized enterprises. \n \n63.  The anticipated social benefits include: (i) increased agricultural sales from upgraded \nmarkets near the airports, (ii) more job opportunities through required civil works, (iii) higher \nschool enrollments and better access to health care with the increase in household incomes, \nand (iv) more opportunities to diversify and expand industrial and agricultural production. \n \n64.  The improved airport facilities will increase the mobility of people and make markets, \nresources, and opportunities more accessible to them. People living in the project areas will \nbenefit directly from job opportunities through the required civil works, market upgrading, and \nbusiness opportunities (particularly in tourism). Airport users will benefit, and so will the local \ncommunities at each project site, including airport market vendors (especially women selling \nvegetables, food, and handicrafts). Public transport service industries and tourism-associated \nindustries will be the secondary beneficiaries. The five airports (including Jackson\u2019s in Port \nMoresby) under project 1 serve a population of up to 1,586,978.  \n ", "16   \nB.  Financial Analysis, Financial Evaluation, and Financial Management Assessment \n  1.  Financial Analysis and Financial Evaluation \n65.  The  CAA  had  operating  revenues  of  K28,400,087  and  operating  expenditures  of \nK69,179,340 in 2008. It also received a substantial government subsidy of K42,400,000 to cover \nthe costs of restructuring, as well as other government subsidies amounting to K48,096,033. \nThe revenues from civil aviation activities alone, without the ongoing government subsidies, are \nnot enough to cover its operating expenditures. These figures exclude overflying charges of \nK17.98 million, which are accounted for separately by PNGASL. \n \n66.  Projected financial statements were prepared for the project 1 airports and PNGASL. \nThe projections were based on assumptions about the following: (i) scheduled and projected \naircraft movements, (ii) projected number of passengers, (iii) rates charged for the landing of \neach  type  of  aircraft,  and  (iv)  passenger  service  charges  for  departing  passengers.  The \nprojected financial statements indicate that PNGASL and Jackson\u2019s airport are sustainable in \nthe long term,11 but the smaller project 1 airports will be only marginally viable without ongoing \ngovernment support. The CAA is now undertaking a special review of the smaller airports to \nestablish accurate operational cost data and begin rationalizing and optimizing costs.  \n \n67.  The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) was estimated through a comparison of \nwith-project  and  without-project  scenarios.  The  FIRRs  for  PNGASL  (167%)  and  Jackson\u2019s \nairport (12%) compare favorably with the weighted average cost of capital of 2.42%. The \nsmaller  project  1  airports  have  negative  FIRRs;  however,  the  investment  program  for  the \nproject 1 airports must proceed because of the safety and security compliance issues identified \nearlier (Supplementary Appendix C). \n \n68.  Given  the  viability  issues  associated  with  the  smaller  project 1  airports,  specific \nperformance  measures  for  monitoring  the  viability  of  the  CAA  would  be  useful.  These \nperformance measures would focus on the two key drivers that CAA must concentrate on to \nbecome viable in the long term\u2014containing expenditures and improving cash flow. A profitability \nmeasure and a cash efficiency measure will therefore be included in the loan agreement. For \nexample, in 2008, CAA expenditures were nearly four times greater than revenues (excluding \ngovernment subsidies). The target benchmark should be to reduce the operating ratio by at \nleast 20% percent by FY2011. Poor receivables management further strains the viability of the \nCAA. In 2008, the number of days\u2019 receivables was 567.12 The benchmark will be set at no \nmore than 75 days by FY2012. \n \n69.  Budgeting and the recording and reporting of airport information must be significantly \nstrengthened to guide the CAA in managing the airports and making future pricing decisions. \nCosts and revenues must be appropriately allocated, and monthly reporting of the key drivers of \nthe business must be introduced. The key drivers include aircraft movements for landing and \nparking fees, passenger movements for terminal facility charges, and number of leases and \nconcessions and the revenues derived from them. Also, as much as possible for each airport, \n                                                 \n11 In 2008, Jackson\u2019s airport had revenues 37\u2013160 times greater than those of the smaller project 1 airports. \n12 A measure of the average time it takes a company\u2019s customers to pay for purchases. The figure for 2008 was \nabnormally high; even so, the figures for 2006 (170) and 2007 (174) were high compared with normally accepted \ncommercial benchmarks. ", "17 \nactual revenues and expenditures (rather than an allocated portion) should be reported, to \nimprove accountability. \n \n70.  Besides cost containment, better cash management, and stronger airport information \nsystems, there must be an increase in revenues. Tariffs must be reviewed frequently to protect \nagainst inflationary pressures and achieve sustainability in asset maintenance. These measures \nwill be dealt with in the policy dialogue under the investment program, and technical expertise \nwill be provided. Attracting larger planes could bring in more revenues at some airports, but \nnon-aero income is the area of opportunity particularly at the larger airports. Such income would \nhelp reduce the CAA\u2019s reliance on government subsidies and improve the viability of the airports \nbusiness.  The  investment  program  will  help  bring  these  airports  up  to  international  safety \nstandards to make the airports business more attractive to international airlines and allow local \nairlines to offer more flights and upgrade to a larger fleet of aircraft. \n  2.  Financial Management Assessment \n71.  Effective financial management within the CAA, both in the effective use of funds and in \nthe safeguarding of assets created, will be a critical success factor for project sustainability. \nADB projects in PNG in recent years have done poorly in both implementation and development \noutcomes, relative to projects in other ADB developing member countries. The major project \nimplementation issues generally are as follows: (i) delays in the approval of contracts by the \nNational Executive Council, (ii) delays in the provision of counterpart funds, and (iii) delays in \nthe submission of audited annual project accounts. A financial management assessment, as \nrequired by ADB, rated the overall inherent risk substantial and the overall control risk high13 \n(Supplementary  Appendix  D).  Particular  issues  involve  insufficiencies  in  the  supporting \ndocumentation submitted to substantiate the liquidation of imprest funds and difficulties in the \naudit  of  annual  project  accounts  due  to  poor  project  record keeping,  unreconciled  bank \naccounts and ledger accounts, and lengthy delays in receiving responses to audit queries. \nGiven these previous issues, direct payment procedures will predominate, imprest accounts will \nnot be established, and the reimbursement procedure for eligible expenditures will apply with full \nsupporting documentation (see para. 60 above). In addition, ADB is now processing capacity \ndevelopment  technical  assistance  for  Supporting  Public  Financial  Management  Project  to \nstrengthen the oversight and monitoring of statutory authorities in PNG, including the CAA.  \n \n72.  The PIU, supported by an accountant and a finance clerk, will be required to maintain \nseparate and adequate project records and accounts to identify (i) the goods and services \nfinanced from the loan proceeds, (ii) the financing resources received, (iii) the expenditures \nincurred for each project component, and (iv) the counterpart and cofinancing funds received \nand spent. The CAA will hire independent external auditors acceptable to ADB to audit the \nconsolidated project accounts yearly, and will submit to ADB certified copies of the audited \naccounts, as well as the auditor\u2019s report, in English within 6 months of the end of each financial \nyear during the implementation period. \nC.  Economic Analysis \n73.  For the economic evaluation, the benefits of project 1 airports were calculated in terms \nof users\u2019 willingness to pay, as reflected in incremental revenues from airport operations, such \nas landing charges and other airport operating fees and charges. The evaluation also included \n                                                 \n13 These ratings are consistent with similar assessments made by development partners in the transport sector. \n ", "18   \nan assessment of (i) benefits to operators, such as savings in direct wear-and-tear costs and \nfuel;  (ii)  benefits  to  passengers,  such  as  direct  time  savings;  (iii)  benefits  from  safety \nimprovements; and (iv) benefits to regional and local communities from such things as the \ndevelopment  of  market  sales  and  tourism.  The  analysis  identified  the  value  added  by \nmore-reliable aircraft operations made possible by improved safety standards at the project 1 \nairports  and  more-efficient  aircraft  handling  of  arrival  and  departure  passengers.  These \noperating  improvements  would  result  from  improvements  in  airport  security  arrangements, \nrunway extensions, extensions in aircraft parking aprons, and terminal improvements. \n \n74.  The economic costs for project 1 include the resource costs for traded and non-traded \ncosts, materials, and labor. All cost elements were valued at border prices, with all taxes and \nduties excluded. A standard conversion factor of 0.90 was applied to the financial costs of \nnon-traded inputs to calculate economic prices. Subproject facilities are expected to have an \naverage economic life of 20 years. \n \n75.  Aircraft, passenger, and freight movements were examined by flight category to identify \ncurrent  and  future  trends  in  scheduled  flights,  second-level  airline  operations,  and  charter \noperations in particular, identifying the future impact of natural resource exploration and the \ndevelopment  impact  on  particular  regional  airports  in  PNG.  While  the  full  impact  of  the \npotentially large liquefied natural gas project has not yet been specified, the potential increase in \ncharter aircraft operations through Mount Hagen airport was identified and incorporated in traffic \nforecasts and the economic impact associated with project 1. \n \n76.  The economic internal rate of return for project 1 is estimated at 45%. A sensitivity \nanalysis tested the effects of possible unfavorable scenarios resulting from changes in the key \nparameters that determine the project\u2019s costs and benefits. This analysis indicates that the \nproject\u2019s economic viability would remain satisfactory even under adverse scenarios, and that it \nwould require a cost increase of 200% or a decrease in benefits of 66% to reach a cutoff \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  of  12%.  An  economic  analysis  of  project  1  airports  is  in \nAppendix 9. \nD.  Poverty and Social Impact \n77.  Social impact and poverty assessment study. If airfares are reduced, people will \nhave more access to regional markets and towns, and will therefore be able to expand and \ndiversify their agricultural production, particularly cash crops. Increased direct sales at markets \nwill have a positive impact on household incomes. People are expected to get better prices for \ntheir products when they can sell at upgraded markets rather than through middlemen. There \nwill  be  also  increased  opportunities  for  the  creation  and  expansion  of  small  businesses \nthroughout the region because of the increased accessibility and customers. The increase in \nhousehold incomes would also make families better able to pay for education and health care. \nTherefore,  the  program  will  contribute  not  only  to  economic  growth  but  also,  indirectly,  to \nimproved  social  indicators  such  as  health  and  education  outcomes  (Supplementary \nAppendix E). \n78.  Apart from Jackson\u2019s airport and the Boram (Wewak) airport, the four other airports are \nmore than 10 kilometers from the main town centers. Hoskins is more than 40 kilometers from \nthe town center. Women in the immediate vicinity of the airport walk with their children to sell \ntheir produce at informal market grounds. These are usually undeveloped or vacant pieces of \nland close to or adjacent to the terminal and parking area of the airport. The investment program ", "19 \nwill support the upgrading of existing local markets around the airport sites through the provision \nof better water supply and sanitation facilities, but the local government and the CAA must \nagree to make the improvements and obtain the agreement of the landowners.  \n \n79.  The airports are now used mostly by employees of large companies, government, a few \nlocal successful businesses, nongovernment organizations, and tourists. An increase in the \npassenger  volume,  particularly  in  the  tourism  sector,  is  foreseen  to  lead  to  lower  airfares \nthroughout  the  region  and  the  country,  making  air  travel  more  affordable  to  the  general \npopulation. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 10. \nE.  Environmental Impact \n80.  Project 1 is classified under environmental category B, according to ADB\u2019s Environment \nPolicy (2002), Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003), and Staff Instruction on the Use of \nMultitranche Financing Facility,14 and as a level 2 activity under PNG\u2019s Environmental Act \n(2000) and Environment (Prescribed Activities) Regulations (2002). Each subsequent project \nwill be categorized in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy rule that is in place at the time \nthe  PFR  is  submitted  to  ADB.  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  for  each  airport \nrehabilitation under project 1 was undertaken to assess the potential environmental impact. An \nenvironmental  assessment  review  framework  that  presents  the  general  anticipated \nenvironmental impact of the investment, the subproject selection criteria, and the subproject \nenvironmental procedure (Supplementary Appendix F) was prepared. The review framework will \nguide the preparation and approval of environmental assessments of future projects considered \nfor financing under the investment program. An environment permit will be secured from the \nDepartment of Environment and Conservation for activities listed in the Environment (Prescribed \nActivities) Regulation (2002). The summary IEE is in Appendix 11. \n \n81.  All five airports under project 1 will be rehabilitated and improved within their existing \nboundaries.  The  environmental  impact  of  airport  rehabilitation  during  construction  was \nassessed, and is deemed insignificant since no major civil works will be undertaken and the \nenvironmental impact will be temporary and reversible and can be mitigated with available \nmethods.  The  environmental  impact  during  operation  will  generally  be  due  to  waste  and \npollution, noise, and vibration. To address this impact, the project will maintain the sewage \nsystem in good condition as part of its airport maintenance program. The impact from noise and \nvibration during airport operation is not expected to increase significantly. A noise buffer will \nnonetheless be put up, where necessary, between the facility and the surrounding areas to \nminimize the impact. The environmental mitigation and monitoring procedures set out in the IEE \nand the environmental management plan (EMP) will minimize the environmental impact from \nthe construction and operation of the subprojects to insignificant levels. \n \n82.  For future subprojects, the EMP for each subproject will be incorporated into the design \nand implementation of airports under these projects. The new Safeguard Policy Statement \n(SPS) dated 20 July 2009 and effective on 20 January 2010 will be applicable. The EMP will \nguide the PIU, supervisory consultants, and contractors in managing, monitoring, and reporting \nenvironmental impact mitigation measures and compliance. Civil works may begin only after \nADB  approves  the  environmental  assessment  report  on  the  subprojects  and  a  permit  for \nactivities specified in the Environment (Prescribed Activities) Regulations (2002) is received \nfrom  the  Department  of  Environment  and  Conservation.  The  environmental  management \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2006. Staff Instruction on the Use of Multitranche Financing Facility. Manila.  \n ", "20   \ncapacity of the PIU to ensure compliance with the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s requirements will \nthus be strengthened. \nF.  Social Safeguards \n83.  Involuntary resettlement. Most of the major airports and terminal facilities in PNG are \nowned and operated by the Government through the CAA. Most of the proposed improvements \nin the 21 airport sites will be undertaken within existing airport boundaries. In case additional \nland is needed for the investment program (any such requirement is expected to be minor), the \nCAA, through the Department of Land and Physical Planning, will process the formal land \nacquisition  according  to  the  Land  Act  of  1996.15  Since  formal  land  acquisition  takes \nconsiderable time, the CAA will also seek alternative options exercised by other agencies such \nas  the  Department  of  Works.  The  provincial  government  will  negotiate  a  memorandum  of \nagreement with the affected clans and communities (local government) to allow the use of the \nland for airport upgrading. \n \n84.  In the case of project 1, all civil works, including the improvement and extension of \nrunways, will be undertaken within the existing airport boundaries (state-owned land); hence, no \nland acquisition is anticipated. However, minor issues related to permanent and temporary \nresettlement may have to be resolved. At the site in Wewak, the proposed extension of the \nBoram airport runway is expected to require the diversion of a feeder road (Perigo road) that \nlinks the settlement to the Brandi Highway. This diversion will result in the relocation of a soccer \nfield of the Correction Institution Services (CIS). The CAA and the CIS have agreed to process \nthe relocation, and the actual work will be included in the scope of work for the Wewak airport \nupgrading.  Other  minor  permanent  and  temporary  impact  under  project  1  includes \ncompensation for the felling of a few trees. \n \n85.  The number of people that may experience the incidental impact of the upgrading of \nairports under the program is therefore expected to be small and well within the category of \u201cno \nsignificant resettlement impact\u201d under ADB\u2019s policy. The four airport sites under project 1 were \nscreened to confirm the level of the impact. The program is a category B program with respect \nto involuntary resettlement. For future subprojects, the SPS will apply. \n \n86.  A resettlement framework was prepared for the investment program and reviewed by the \nGovernment to establish policies and procedures for compensating the affected people for lost \nor damaged assets (Supplementary Appendix G). (The summary resettlement framework is in \nAppendix 12.) The resettlement framework is based on the principles established in ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995) and relevant sections of the Operations Manual (as \nupdated  in  2006).  The  resettlement  framework  will  guide  the  CAA  in  preparing  and \nimplementing  the  resettlement  issues  in  the  investment  program.  Since  the  impact  of  the \nproject 1 airports will be minor, due diligence reports were prepared for four sites including \nWewak, Hoskins, Mount Hagen, and Gurney (Supplementary Appendix H). The reports will be \nfurther updated on the basis of the detailed engineering designs during implementation. \n \n87.  Indigenous  people.  PNG  is  made  up  of  over  600  islands  and  is  a  diverse \nagglomeration of tribal groups speaking 800 distinct languages. No particular ethnic group \n                                                 \n15  Regarding the state alienation of customary land, the Land Act of 1996 states that affected clans and communities \nwill be compensated for land; individuals and households with assets on the land will be compensated for any \ndamage to or loss of these assets; and clans and communities will be compensated according to the provisions of \nagreements.  ", "21 \ndominates economic or political life within the sites for project 1, which include four provinces \n(East Sepik, West New Britain, Western Highland, and Milne Bay) and the National Capital \nDistrict. Two major languages are spoken in these areas. Pidgin is spoken by the majority and \nHiri Motu is spoken mainly around Port Moresby and elsewhere in Papua. English is the \nlanguage of administration and official communication, but Tok Pisin, Hiri Motu, or the local \nlanguage (Tok Ples) is the preferred day-to-day means of communication. \n \n88.  In general, no tribes or ethnic groups in PNG are significantly different from others or \nconsider themselves to be minorities; therefore, no ethnic minority groups are expected to be \nadversely affected by the investment program. The program is a category B program with \nrespect to ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998); no separate framework or plans for \nindigenous peoples will be prepared. Necessary actions favorable to indigenous peoples will be \ntaken through the resettlement framework and resettlement plans. For future subprojects, the \nSPS will apply. \nG.  Assumptions and Risks \n89.  The investment program involves the following assumptions and risks: \n \n(i)  Shortage  of  civil  works  contractors.  The  implementation  of  the  proposed \nairport infrastructure works will be affected by the lack of capable international \nand national contractors. The Government is fully aware of the issues and is \nresponding by (a) ensuring the safety of international contractors through the \nprovincial governments, (b) improving the licensing and classification of national \ncontractors,  and  (c)  providing  opportunities  to  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises in the construction industry. \n(ii)  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  Customary  landholding  in  PNG \ncomplicates and prolongs the process of land acquisition. Where required, the \nCAA will negotiate a memorandum of agreement with the affected clans and \ncommunities (local government) to allow the use of land for airport upgrading \nwhile the formal acquisition process is fulfilled.  \n(iii)  Security. Security in PNG continues to be an issue with contractors working on \nongoing infrastructure projects, including roads. The CAA, with the support of the \nprovincial governments, must deal with this issue. \n(iv)  Institutional capacity. The investment program needs good institutions. Strong \nmanagement  and  governance,  good  planning,  best-practice  concepts,  sound \nproject management, fiduciary oversight, and transparent bidding and contract \nmanagement processes require not only experienced personnel but also efficient \nsystems and procedures and controls. \n(v)  Financing.  ADB will provide the necessary funding for capital expenditure, but \nthe main issue in the long run will be maintenance and repairs. For this, there \nmust  be  a  recurrent  budget  allocation.  Budget  allocations  in  the  past  were \nhaphazard, and, in the continuing economic downturn, economic and financial \nconditions within and outside the country could deteriorate, thereby restricting \ngrowth and development. \n \n \n ", "22   \nV.  UNDERTAKINGS AND ASSURANCES \n90.  Specific undertakings. The Government and the CAA have agreed to the following \nundertakings: \n \n(i)  to implement, monitor, and evaluate the facility in the context of the design and \nmonitoring framework for the facility;  \n(ii)  to provide its share of funding for the investment program in accordance with the \nfinancing plan and the implementation schedule, as well as provide for any cost \noverruns in excess of the contingencies of this investment program and the \nprojects; \n(iii)  for  every  subproject,  to  fully  implement,  as  required,  the  environmental \nassessment and review framework and the resettlement framework;   \n(iv)  to  ensure  that  the  CAA  (a)  undertakes  annual  airport  safety  audits  of  all \ninvestment program airports, and (b) installs appropriate airport safety facilities \nduring project implementation, including pavement markings, warning signs, and \nhazard barriers;  \n(v)  to ensure that the necessary and qualified staff are engaged throughout the \ninvestment program period, and that the CAA establishes and implements on a \ntimely basis the operational and financial management system, and awards and \nmanages the long-term maintenance contracts, all with assistance under the \ninvestment program;   \n(vi)  notwithstanding item (ii) above, in the event of any shortfall in maintenance \nfunds, to meet such shortfall from its own budgetary resources, and from a \nregular review of tariffs, including passenger terminal fees;  \n(vii)  with the support of the investment program support consultants and resources \nfrom  other  development  partners\u2019  programs  (e.g.,  the  AusAID  TSSP),  to \nundertake capacity development for the CAA, Papua New Guinea Air Services \nLtd and other  affiliated institutions operating in the civil aviation sector;  \n(viii)  to ensure that a project performance monitoring system for the facility and each \ntranche is developed, with reports prepared for each tranche; and   \n(ix)  to ensure that (a) the investment program is carried out in compliance with all \napplicable  PNG  anticorruption  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy; \n(b) all  staff  of  the  CAA  and  subsidiary  companies  are  trained  in  PNG\u2019s \nanticorruption  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy;  and  (c)  a  CAA \nwebsite  is  developed  and  maintained  to  disclose  the  audited  annual  project \naccounts, project progress, and procurement activities. \n \n91.  Specific assurances. In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and the \nCAA have agreed to give the following assurances with respect to project 1, and to include such \nassurances in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Environment.  The  Government,  through  the  PIU,  will  ensure  that  (a) the \ninvestment program is carried out in accordance with the project design, and that \nconstruction and operations comply with all the applicable  environmental laws of \nthe  Government  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy;  (b) the  environmental \nmanagement program (EMP) as presented in the IEE is updated during the final \ndesign  of  the  project  facility  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval  before  the \nissuance of relevant bidding documents to any interested civil work contractors; \n(c) the environmental mitigation measures specified in the EMP are incorporated ", "23 \ninto the bidding documents, and the civil works contractor\u2019s specifications include \nrequirements to comply with the environmental mitigation measures contained in \nthe EMP; (d) civil works contractors are closely supervised to ensure compliance; \n(e) the investment program undertakes environment monitoring and reflects the \nresults in the project progress reports and project completion report; (f) adequate \nenvironmental  management  and  monitoring  training  is  provided  to  the \nenvironment officer of the CAA to increase his or her capacity for environmental \nsupervision and monitoring during construction and operations; and (g) adequate \nsupport is provided to the environment specialist of CAA to ensure that he or she \nproperly undertakes the tasks. \n(ii)  Land acquisition and resettlement. The Government and CAA will ensure that \nall investment program civil works for upgrading airports are undertaken within \nthe  existing  airport  boundary  to  the  extent  possible.  In  the  event  of  any \nunforeseen land acquisition or resettlement needs, the Government will inform \nADB and prepare and implement a resettlement plan. The resettlement plans will \nbe  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  program  resettlement  framework,  which \ncomplies with the relevant PNG laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995). The Government will allocate adequate resources to \nprepare  and  implement  the  resettlement  plan  and  supervise  and  monitor  its \nimplementation.  The  Government,  through  CAA,  will  ensure  that  (a) land \nacquisition does not commence before the resettlement plan or due diligence \nreport is reviewed and approved by ADB; (b) civil works do not start until the \naffected people identified in the resettlement plan or due diligence report have \nbeen compensated at replacement value for their losses due to the program; \n(c) the  resettlement  plan  is  updated  after  the  completion  of  detailed  design, \nagreed  on  with  ADB,  and  disclosed  to  the  affected  people;  and  (d) all \ncompensation is paid in a legal and transparent manner before taking possession \nof the acquired land, structures, and other assets. The Government will finance \nall land acquisition and resettlement costs from its resources. \n(iii)  Gender  and  development.  CAA  will  (a) encourage  contractors  to  employ \nwomen in airport and market upgrading works such as for management and \nengineering works, (b) provide equal pay to men and women for work of equal \ntype in accordance with national laws and international treaty obligations, and \n(c) provide safe working conditions for both male and female workers. Specific \nprovisions to this effect will be included in the bidding documents for civil works. \nThe CAA will review the achievement of hiring women in the project progress \nreports and project completion report. \n(iv)  Ethnic minorities. The Government will ensure that the program does not have \nany adverse impact on the livelihood of ethnic minorities living in the project area. \nIn the event of any unforeseen impact on the livelihood of ethnic minorities, \n(a) the Government will inform ADB and prepare a plan according to relevant \nlaws and regulations, and ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples, and (b) civil \nworks will not start until ADB has reviewed and approved the plan. \n(v)  Health risks. The Government, through the CAA, will ensure that all civil works \ncontractors participate in the STI and HIV prevention program to be funded under \nthe project in the construction campsites. In addition, the CAA will ensure that \nsimilar  information  on  the  risk  of  transmission  of  STI  and  HIV/AIDS  is \ndisseminated  at  the  worksites  and  local  communities,  in  coordination  with \nnational  and  provincial  aids  councils  and  local  nongovernment  organizations \nworking on the issue. The CAA will include specific provisions to this effect in civil \nworks contracts, and strictly monitor compliance. \n ", "24   \n(vi)  Labor laws. The Government, through the CAA, will ensure that civil works \ncontractors comply with all applicable labor laws and related international treaty \nobligations, and do not employ child labor or trafficked labor for any activities. \nThe CAA will ensure that specific provisions to this effect are included in civil \nworks contracts, and strictly monitor compliance. \n(vii)  Grievance and redress mechanism. Within 3 months of the loan effectiveness \ndate, the Government  shall establish a complaint and problem management \nmechanism under a neutral agency acceptable to ADB to (a) review and address \ngrievances of project stakeholders, in relation to the investment program, any of \nthe service providers, or any person responsible for carrying out the investment \nprogram; and (b) set the threshold criteria and procedures for handling such \ngrievances,  for  proactively  responding  to  them,  and  for  providing  the \nstakeholders with notice of the chosen mechanism or action. \n(viii)  Counterpart funding. The Government will provide, on a timely basis, all funds \nand  resources  necessary  for  upgrading,  rehabilitation,  maintenance,  land \nacquisition costs, and compensation for assets and management of the project \nfacilities financed under the investment program. \n(ix)  Financial  sustainability.  The  CAA  will  put  in  place  specific  performance \nmeasures to monitor a reduction in expenditure and an increase in cash flow. \nSpecifically, an operating ratio measure and an accounts receivable efficiency \nmeasure will be included in the legal documents. The target benchmark for the \noperating ratio measure will be to achieve a reduction in the FY2008 operating \nratio  of  at  least  20%  by  2011.  The  benchmark  for  the  accounts  receivable \nefficiency measure will be no more than 70 days by 2012. \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n92.

The Transport System \n1.  Papua New Guinea (PNG) faces very-difficult geographic conditions for the provision of \ntransport  because  of  its  rugged  terrain  and  an  extreme  climate  that  makes  the  supply  of \ninfrastructure and its sustainable operation very costly. The lack of an extensive and safe road \nsystem has led to a significant reliance on aviation as a major transport mode for tourism and \nbusiness, exports and imports, domestic freight, and social cohesion.  \nB.  Sector Structure \n2.  Civil aviation supports the socioeconomic development of the country by providing safe, \nefficient, reliable, sustainable, and affordable aviation services and infrastructure to facilitate \naccess to the country and improve the mobility of communities. The sector is also responsible \nfor meeting its important community service obligations to provide access to noncommercial \ndestinations.  \n \n3.  Two key institutions administer, regulate, manage, and operate the civil aviation sector. \nThe  Department  of  Works,  Transport  and  Civil  Aviation  (DWTCA)  is  the  lead  agency  for \ntransport strategy and planning for all three modes of transport. Its responsibilities include the \nmonitoring of international obligations, the negotiation of air service agreements, economic \nregulation, the investigation of air accidents, and sector policy and planning. The Civil Aviation \nAuthority (CAA) is the main operational agency. Its responsibilities include airport development \nand operations, air traffic services, and property development. It is also responsible for safety \nand security regulation and oversight, which conflicts with its operational responsibilities. \n \n4.  The market for air services consists of three major airlines: Air Niugini, Airlines PNG, and \nPacific Blue. The three airlines compete on some international routes, but only the first two \noperate domestic services. Both turboprop and jet aircraft operate on major routes to provincial \ncapitals, but only turboprop aircraft operate on secondary trunk routes. The rural market is \npredominantly served by small aircraft as a feeder service. Other air operators in PNG provide \ncharters, surveys, flight training, and industry-specific operations.  \n \n5.  Private sector and government commercial stakeholders include airlines, charter and \nprivate air operators, airport concessionaires and tenants, tourist operators, air cargo operators, \nmaintenance  organizations,  and  flight  training  organizations.  Other  stakeholders  include \ngovernment  agencies  responsible  for  customs,  quarantine,  immigration,  and  security; \ninternational airline associations; and international organizations responsible for global safety \nand security monitoring. In addition, PNG is a member of the Pacific Islands Civil Aviation \nSafety and Security Treaty and uses the Pacific Aviation Safety Office, a nonprofit international \norganization, for technical services related to safety and security oversight. \nC.  Key Issues and Constraints \n6.  Key issues and constraints fall into two areas: infrastructure and finance, and institutions \nand capacity. In terms of infrastructure, aviation facilities are extensive but capital investment \nremains inadequate to meet the future needs of the industry, while recurrent expenditure has \nfailed to keep up with maintenance requirements. In terms of institutions, the CAA is undergoing \na well-planned restructuring but, because of capacity constraints, is struggling to execute its \nmaintenance and investments to maintain compliance with safety and security standards.  \n ", "32  Appendix 2 \n1.  Infrastructure and Finance \n7.  There are more than 450 airports, airfields, and airstrips in PNG. Of this total, there are \n21 designated national airports.1 Most of the major airports and terminal facilities are owned and \noperated on behalf of the Government by the CAA while the minor airports are owned by \nprovincial governments. There are some remote and district airfields and related facilities, which \nare privately owned and operated.  \n \n8.  National  airport  facilities  typically  (i)  lack  safety  and  security  compliance;  (ii) have \nair-side  pavements,  terminal  buildings,  equipment,  and  utilities  in  poor  condition;  (iii) have \npavements in accelerated deterioration; and (iv) are inadequately maintained. Air navigation \nsystems in PNG are unreliable and deteriorating because of (i) old and obsolete equipment, \n(ii) lack of spare parts, (iii) theft and vandalism, (iv) unreliable power and communications, and \n(v) logistics problems. \n \n9.  The consequences of poor infrastructure and air navigation services include (i) canceled \nflights; (ii) restricted operations; (iii) higher costs to airlines due to reduced payload and the \nneed  to  divert  flights;  and  (iv)  higher  costs  to  public  and  private  business  due  to  flight \ncancellations, rescheduling, and diversions. Airlines face the risk of airport closures and cannot \ninvest in future aircraft types; they may therefore have to reduce capacity into important tourism \nand  economic  regions,  with  consequent  adverse  effects  on  the  economy  and  social \ndevelopment. \n \n10.  The  civil  aviation  sector  derives  its  funding  primarily  from  Department  of  Treasury \nappropriations. DWTCA is entirely funded by the Government, and the CAA by a combination of \nrevenues from airport and airspace fees and charges, licensing and regulatory fees, and annual \nappropriations from government based on a community service obligation policy in the National \nTransport Development Plan (NTDP) 2006\u20132010. These sources have not delivered sufficient \nor timely funds to arrest the decline in airport and airways infrastructure and equipment.  \n \n11.  The CAA requires external funding to meet its obligations and execute its strategic plan, \nas it does not have the financial capacity required to adequately fund safety and security \nmaintenance or the capital investment required for the significant remedial and upgrading work \nneeded to meet both existing and future airport needs. The Government\u2019s competing priorities \nfor funds and fiscal strategies have resulted in significant annual underfunding of the CAA over \nmany years.  \n \n12.  Most  external  assistance  to  date  has  been  provided  by  the  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational Development (AusAID) through funding for strategic studies, specialist advisers to \nthe  Government  and  the  CAA\u2019s  small  and  medium-sized  infrastructure  projects,  and  the \nprocurement of equipment. There have been no large investments in the sector from other \nexternal sources. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is currently advising the Government in \nregard to the establishment of a public\u2013private partnership framework.  \n                                                 \n1  Buka, Chimbu, Daru, Goroka, Gurney, Hoskins, Kavieng, Kerema, Kiunga, Madang, Mendi, Momote, Mt Hagen, \nNadzab, Popendetta, Port Moresby, Tari, Tokua, Vanimo, Wapenamanda, and Wewak.  ", "Appendix 2  33 \n2.  Institutions and Capacity \n13.  The  aviation  sector  is  facing  institutional  capacity  issues  at  many  levels.  The \nGovernment\u2019s aviation strategies are demanding, but there are insufficient skills and depth of \nexperience in all the delivery areas for successful implementation.  \n \n14.  The CAA is charged with operating, managing, and developing the national airports. In \naccordance with government policies to facilitate efficient and effective delivery of services, \nimprove financial performance, and achieve a clear separation of regulatory and operational \nfunctions, the CAA is currently undergoing restructuring from CAA to the National Airports \nCorporation, which will operate as a holding company of three autonomous business units (PNG \nAirports Ltd. [PNGAL], PNG Air Services Ltd. [PNGASL], and Airport City Development Ltd. \n[ADL]). All three have been formally established, but only PNGASL has become operational. \nThe CAA\u2019s strategic plan calls for the restructuring to be completed in 2009. \n \n15.  PNGAL will have responsibilities to commercially operate, manage, and maintain Port \nMoresby\u2019s Jackson\u2019s International Airport, and to manage, develop, and operate the other \nnational airports. PNGASL operates as a commercial entity providing air navigation services. \nADL is a real estate management, property development, and project management company \nintended to enhance the financial viability of airports and related infrastructure by developing the \nbusiness portfolios of the restructured CAA and its subsidiaries. \n \n16.  Regulatory oversight of safety and security is currently undertaken by the air safety \nregulations branch within the CAA. The transition to an independent safety regulator will put \nmore emphasis on the separation of regulatory functions from service delivery, as well as more \nemphasis on cost recovery and viability. The Government will continue to fund safety regulation \nthrough annual statutory grants, offset by service fees and charges. Accident and incident \ninvestigations will continue to be undertaken by the DWTCA\u2019s accident investigation center. \n \n17.  A key issue in the transition is the capacity to deliver a final structure and functional \ncapacity that meets the expected outcomes. There is also concern at the effectiveness of the \nexisting  structures  for  coordination  and  collaboration  between  the  policy  functions  within \nDWTCA and the business and service delivery functions of the CAA and eventually the National \nAirports Corporation. \nD.  Government Policies and Strategies \n18.  The  Government\u2019s  transport  policies  are  the  Medium  Term  Development  Strategy \n(MTDS) 2005\u20132010 and the more-detailed NTDP 2006\u20132010. These documents contain the \noverarching policies, objectives, and actions that guide the development and operation of the \ntransport sector. Both are currently undergoing review, with completion expected within 2009.  \n \n19.  The  MTDS  has  seven  priorities,  importantly  including  the  \u201crehabilitation  and \nmaintenance of transport infrastructure.\u201d This particular priority is seen as essential to sustaining \ntrade and access, and underpinning PNG\u2019s future development and economic growth and \nprosperity.  \n \n20.  The NTDP vision for the aviation sector includes (i) competition on domestic routes and \naccess to these routes by foreign airlines; (ii) the operation of larger aircraft at major national \nairports; (iii) accessible, safe reliable, efficient, and affordable air transport; (iv) improved and \nreasonably priced international services to establish PNG as a gateway between continents; \nand (v) lower-cost and safer passenger and cargo movements. The NTDP has proposed major \n ", "34  Appendix 2 \ninvestments  at  six  national  airports  (Gurney,  Madang,  Mount  Hagen,  Nadzab,  Tokua,  and \nWewak) to facilitate growth and eventual competition on domestic routes.  \n \n21.  A key objective of the NTDP is the reform of the CAA to become self-sufficient and fund \nmuch of the remedial airport and airways maintenance. The CAA strategic plan was prepared in \naccordance with the MTDS and NTDP policies and priorities. The key objectives are (i) in the \nshort  term,  to  attend  to  critical  safety  and  security  requirements  and  implement  structural \nreform;  (ii) in  the  medium  term,  to  facilitate  economic  and  social  development  through \nsustainable aviation infrastructure; and (iii) in the long term, to realize an acceptable rate of \nreturn on investments. \nE.  Gaps and Opportunities \n22.  The main issue for the CAA is to achieve certification of all national airports through \ntargeted  investments  in  rehabilitation,  maintenance,  and  equipment.  This  work  is  urgently \nrequired to maintain access throughout the country. In the medium term, a second important \nissue is to upgrade about one-third of the national airports to accept larger aircraft and thereby \neliminate  transport  bottlenecks,  accommodate  airline  expansion  investment  programs,  and \nenable growth outside of Port Moresby. However, the CAA and its subsidiary units face a clear \nfunding gap in achieving this vision. The investment program will address this funding gap. \n \n23.  Related to these issues is the difficulty in achieving the Government\u2019s policy for the CAA \nand subsidiary units to achieve operating cost recovery. In the near term, this is possible only at \nPort Moresby\u2019s Jackson\u2019s International Airport, which is also the only airport that would be \nattractive to private investors, probably via a public\u2013private participation model. A very-limited \nnumber  of  other  airports  could  achieve  full  operational  cost  recovery  over  the  investment \nprogram period. The rest of the national airports will not be commercially viable and will have a \nsignificant  negative  impact  on  the  CAA\u2019s  annual  financial  performance  and  ability  to  fund \ninvestment programs. The investment program will facilitate economic growth, a commensurate \nincrease  in  traffic  through  eventual  competition  on  domestic  routes  (among  other  means), \nregular  reviews  of  landing  charges  and  terminal  fees,  and  prudent  operating  and  capital \nexpenditure to help achieve this objective. \n.  \n24.  On  the  institutional  side,  the  capacity  of  the  CAA  and  its  subsidiary  units  to  fully \nimplement the planned restructure in an effective and timely manner is still developing. The \naviation  policies  and  strategies  being  pursued  by  the  Government  are  very  demanding  in \nimplementation and will involve the successful coordination of a number of stakeholders. There \nis a resource gap in experienced and qualified staff to meet the Government\u2019s objectives. The \ncreation of an independent safety regulator faces similar constraints. Some advisory support for \npolicy development and administration is being provided by AusAID through the Transport \nSector  Support  Program.  The  investment  program  will  provide  continuous  strategy  and \nimplementation assistance, funded through the loan, to increase ownership, develop capacity, \nand improve control through government systems. \nF.  Sector Road Map \n25.  To  put  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  into  operation,  the  CAA  has  developed  the \nInfrastructure  Investment  Plan\u2013Long  Term  (2010\u20132030),  which  has  been  endorsed  by  the \nNational Executive Committee as the sector plan. The plan has five main components: (i) safety \nand  security  infrastructure  requirements  for  compliance  with  ICAO  standards;  (ii) remedial \nmaintenance  work  to  repair  air-side  pavements  and  improve  infrastructure  to  provide  for \nunrestricted  all-weather  services  by  existing  jet  aircraft  to  selected  national  airports; \n(iii) improved  national  airport  infrastructure  to  provide  access  for  future  larger  and  heavier ", "Appendix 2  35 \naircraft; (iv) upgraded air traffic management system, radar, and surveillance equipment for the \nPort  Moresby  flight  information  region  and  instrument  landing  systems  for  the  Jackson\u2019s \nInternational Airport; and (v) sector-wide policy initiatives to support efficient and cost-effective \ntransport of travelers and freight cargo. \n \n26.  The required investments for the sector plan from 2010 to 2030 were originally planned \nby the CAA over 20 years because of financing and capacity constraints. The total required \nsector investment is estimated at K1.710 billion, as shown in Table A2.1.  \n \nTable A2.1: Investment and Maintenance Requirements for National Airports \n(K million/$ million) \n  2010\u2013 2012\u2013 2016\u2013 2021\u2013 2026\u2013 Total \nActivity  2011  2015 2020 2025 2030 \nUpgrade to B737   260  40  75  75  50  500 \nImprove to F100   50  110  80  20  30  290 \nRehab for  54  46  25  58  142  325 \nCertification  \nEquipment  24  24  21  10    79 \nContingencies  81  47  43  36  47  254 \nDesign and  85  48  44  36  49  263 \nSupervision  \nTotal (K)  554  315  288  234  318  1,710 \nTotal ($)  177.3  101.0  92.3  75.1  101.9  547.6 \nSources: Civil Aviation Authority and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n27.

ADB\u2019s Strategy \n28.  ADB\u2019s country assistance strategy2 supports the implementation of the Government\u2019s \nMTDS 2005\u22122010, in which the transport sector is one of four main strategic areas for ADB \nengagement. The NTDP 2006\u20132010 articulates goals for the sector including maintenance, \nrehabilitation, and improved infrastructure for roads, ports, and airports; and adherence to \nminimum  safety  standards.  Another  key  issue  is  the  reform  of  state-owned  enterprises, \nincluding the CAA. The restructuring of the CAA is under way, and can be consolidated through \nimplementation assistance and technical assistance for capacity building.  \n \n29.  As proposed, the Civil Aviation Development Investment Program will finance about 85% \nof the sector plan. It will address financing and capacity constraints so that the urgent airport \nimprovements can be implemented fully within the planned program duration of 9 years. The \nproposed sequencing of works matches the CAA\u2019s priorities in the sector plan. The investment \nprogram is included in the updated Country Operations Business Plan 2009\u20132011.3 \n \n30.  The investment program is proposed for financing under ADB\u2019s multitranche financing \nfacility (MFF). This financing modality suits the investment program because it (i) supports the \nGovernment\u2019s  and  the  CAA\u2019s  long-term  vision  for  the  sector,  (ii) responds  to  long-term \ninvestment and capacity development needs, (iii) enables a long-term partnership to consolidate \nsector  reforms,  (iv) provides  flexibility  in  timing  and  investment  size  for  each  tranche, \n(v) provides an opportunity to apply lessons from early tranches to guide subsequent tranches \nand improve incentives for reforms and implementation efficiency, and (vi) provides increased \ncertainty to private companies interested in pursuing long-term opportunities in the aviation \nsector. \nH.  Expected Outcomes and Indicators \n31.  The  expected  impact  of  the  investment  program  will  be  a  civil  aviation  sector  that \nsupports  the  MTDS  2005\u20132010  objectives  of  (i) economic  growth,  (ii) rural  development, \n(iii) poverty reduction, and (iv) human resource development. The outcomes of the program will \nbe infrastructure and supporting institutions for civil aviation that are accessible, safe, reliable, \nand cost-effective. The performance targets are (i) 21 national airports rehabilitated and certified \nto meet ICAO safety and security standards by 2018, (ii) 7 national airports improved and \ncapacity increased to accommodate larger aircraft and meet future transport needs, and (iii) the \ncompleted upgrading of the air traffic management systems and installation of surveillance and \nnavigation aid equipment. \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2006.

Introduction \n1.  Air transport plays a vital role in the economic and social development of Papua New \nGuinea (PNG) because of the mountainous terrain of vast areas of the inland regions of the \ncountry,  where  road  access  between  communities  is  difficult,  and  the  numerous  islands \nthroughout the country, where coastal and interisland shipping services are infrequent and \ninvolve long journey times. In addition to accessibility to government, health, community, and \nlaw-and-order services, airports are increasingly providing access to mobile communications \nfacilities required to provide reliable service throughout the country.  \n \n2.  The deterioration of airport infrastructure and ground navigation aids in the last decade \nhas begun to affect the PNG economy by increasing air service operating costs and reducing \nthe safety of air services. Failure to reverse these adverse trends will lead to restrictions on \nsome airport operations, the provision of air services by smaller aircraft, a reduction in air \nservice frequency, and in some cases the cessation of regular passenger transport (RPT) \noperations into the worst-affected airports.  \n \n3.  The investment program will help PNG address its need for continuous domestic air \nservice operations to its dispersed communities and for mobile communications infrastructure \nthrough urgently needed upgrading and improvements in the highest-priority airports. Aviation \nsector safety in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization standards will be \nimproved and regional economic growth stimulated through construction activity and economic \ngrowth in local communities. \nB.  Traffic Forecasts \n4.  Domestic RPT air services are provided by two air service operators\u2014Air Niugini (ANG) \nand Airlines of Papua New Guinea (APNG). ANG, the dominant operator, uses 5 Fokker 100 \n(F100) planes, a 100-seat regional jet aircraft, and 8 De Havilland DHC-8 (Dash 8) turboprop \nregional  airliners,  seating  30\u201340  passengers  in  the  100  and  200  series  aircraft  and \n50 passengers  in  the  stretched  300  series.  APNG  operates  a  fleet  of  15  Dash  8  aircraft, \nincluding 8 of the smaller 100 and 200 series and 7 of the stretched 300 series.  \n \n5.  Route  traffic  records  are  maintained  essentially  for  aviation  sector  fee  charging \npurposes, and aggregation of the data for statistical purposes is limited.

Growth trends are somewhat distorted by services being restricted at some airports, a \nhigh degree of second-level charter and private aircraft activity from selected airports (e.g., \nMount Hagen), and the exogenous impact on specific airports due to exploration, mining, and \nresource  processing  sites  being  developed  and  exploited.  Generally,  there  is  a  strong \nunderlying growth trend in aviation sector activity, involving a 7.5% trend in passenger growth \nand 2% growth in aircraft movements. Because of the small relative size of RPT operations in \nPNG, aircraft change to larger-capacity aircraft can have a distorting effect on steady aircraft \nmovement growth at individual airports. \nC.  Methodology \n7.  The methodology used follows the standard practice of comparing economic costs and \nbenefits with and without the project, using economic internal rate of return (EIRR) and EIRR \nsensitivities to further increases in costs and decreases in benefits as decision criteria. \n \n8.  A 20-year evaluation period was used and the residual value at the end of this period \nwas assumed to be zero. The benefits and costs of the project occur as an annual stream, at \ndifferent points in time, as benefits start after expenditure has been completed. All costs and \nbenefits used for the analysis are in 2009 values. \nD.  Costs  \n9.  The financial costs of the subprojects consist of all incremental capital expenditures, but \nexclude  price  contingencies  and  interest  and  other  charges  during  construction.  The \nincremental operation and maintenance costs of the project facilities were estimated on the \nbasis of cost parameters developed by the consultant. The project\u2019s economic costs include the \nresource costs for traded and non-traded costs, materials, and labor. All cost elements are \nvalued at border prices, with all taxes and duties excluded. A standard conversion factor of 0.9 \nwas applied to the financial costs of non-traded inputs to calculate economic prices. Table A9.2 \npresents the economic costs for each airport. Project facilities are expected to have an average \neconomic life of 20 years. ", "Appendix 9  53 \nE.  Benefits \n10.  The project is primarily aimed at improving aviation operations and safety standards by \nrehabilitating  existing  facilities  to  cater  to  current  aircraft  types  (F100),  including  runways, \ntaxiways, aprons; airfield drainage and maintenance, operational, and terminal facilities; and \nnavigation equipment. To measure project benefits, the willingness-to-pay approach has been \napplied to estimate incremental aviation revenues for air-side and land-side operations. Other \neconomic benefits considered for economic analysis are (i) aircraft operating cost savings \naccrued from non-incremental movement of aircraft; (ii) passenger time savings accrued from \nnon-incremental movement of aircraft; (iii) benefits from safety improvements; and (iv) benefits \nto  regional  and  local  communities  from  construction  activity,  market  sales,  and  increased \ntourism. A standard conversion factor of 0.9 was applied to the financial value of benefits to \ncalculate their economic value.  \n \n11.  The benefits to operators are significant in terms of improvements in aircraft productivity \nresulting from a reduction in air operating time due to landing delays, as well as a reduction in \ndowntime for maintenance through the elimination of costs associated with damage to aircraft \n(external  instruments,  wing  flaps,  propeller  blades,  engines)  caused  by  flying  stones  from \ndeteriorated sealed runways; and a reduction in  costs for braking systems and tire replacement \ndue to a longer operational life of braking systems and tires. Airline savings would also arise \nfrom the elimination of flight delay direct costs (e.g., having to accommodate overnight crews \nand passengers at a regional airport after an aircraft was made \u201cnonoperational\u201d on landing \nwhen damage to brakes, tires, or undercarriage, for example, occurred); the cost of relocating \nreplacement  aircrafts;  and  the  associated  cost  impact  on  national  flight  schedules.  The \ninvestment program subprojects will also diminish the risk and economic costs of accidents or \nother incidents caused by poor airstrip conditions, inadequate airport security fencing, and \ninoperative navigational and landing equipment. \n \n12.  Passengers will benefit from improved arrival and departure reliability, savings in travel \ntime  (valued  in  terms  of  the  economic  value  of  time)  and  in  the  diminished  risk  of  flight \ncancellation or diversion, and safety improvements calculated on the basis of risk reduction of a \ncatastrophic accident.1 \n \n13.  The  confidence  of  passengers  is  currently  affected  by  reduced  seat  availability  at \nairports where runway damage causes service downgrade to smaller aircraft, safety hazards, \nand a poor record of on-time arrivals and departures. \n \n14.  It is significant to recognize that in PNG air safety is largely controlled through RPT \nairline operating procedures and line captain in-flight decisions. Safety limitations, such as poor \nweather  forecasting  services,  outdated  airport  landing  profiles,  short  landing  fields,  and \nunsecured airport boundaries, are managed by air service operators, with consequential impact \non their aircraft operational costs. While major aircraft accidents and incidents are less likely \nunder these operational conditions, airline operational costs are higher as a consequence. \nUnsecured airport boundary fences, for example, are managed through aircraft procedures \ninvolving inspection overflights before landing. Short landing fields are accommodated by short \nfield landing and takeoff procedures that require more-precise pilot judgment and control and \nhigher aircraft operating costs.  \n \n                                                 \n1  According to the risk factors for different types of airfields, the current risk of catastrophic accident would be \nreduced by one accident in 10 million operating hours. \n ", "54  Appendix 9 \n15.  In the regions and local communities, other than direct labor benefits related to airport \nconstruction and operation, the economy could enjoy significant second-round benefits from \nincreased market sales (at those airports where market facility is provided under the investment \nprogram) and tourism. Calculations have assumed that all airports will receive some incremental \nforeign and local tourist and business traffic because of improved  and reliable air service \naccess. All airports other than Port Moresby have significant attractive tourism resources, and \nall  have  business  potential  to  be  further  accessed.  A  forecast  based  on  conservative \nassumptions was developed to calculate benefits, assuming only 20% of incremental business \nand tourism expenditure represents the real cost of consumption of locally produced goods and \nservices and return on local investments. On this basis, it is estimated that about K400 per \ntourist and K227 per business visitor represents the real net benefit from these visitors arriving \nby air. The long-term benefits to the community are conservative, because they would also \ninclude the unquantified benefits from additional employment that would not be created if the \nairports had not been improved. \n \n16.  A conservative approach was adopted in assessing quantifiable benefits incorporated \ninto  the  economic  appraisal.  Incremental  financial  revenue  was  derived  from  the  financial \nanalysis, adjusted using a standard conversion factor of 0.9. Airline operating cost savings were \nassessed  on  the  basis  of  direct  aircraft  operating  cost  savings  of  10%  of  hourly  aircraft \noperating costs for F100, DASH 8 (100, 200, and 300 series), and Twin Otter aircraft, on a with \n(wet) and without (dry) aircrew basis, when improvement in terminal or airport apron movement \nwere involved. Passenger time cost savings were conservatively calculated assuming time cost \nsavings of 10 minutes valued at K14 per hour (weighted average salary of business and private \npassenger average salaries). Safety improvements were assessed in consultation with ANG \nand  APNG,  using  a  proxy  value  based  on  aircraft  operating  cost  savings  equivalent  to \n15 minutes for each landing at airports where improved security was provided through new \nsecurity fencing.2 Regional benefits were conservatively assessed on the basis of increased \nbusiness  and  tourist  passenger  spending  of  30%  and  20%  per  total  visit  expenditure, \nrespectively.3 \nF.  Economic Internal Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis \n17.  The EIRR for the seven airports and Papua New Guinea Air Services Limited varies \nbetween 17.7% and 507.2%, with a consolidated EIRR of 45.3%, indicating that project 1 is \neconomically viable (Table A9.2). \n \nTable A9.2: Summary of Economic Analyses \nNPV \nProject 1 Airport Location  EIRR  (K million) \nPapua New Guinea Air Services Economic Analysis  86.2%  44.5 \nPort Moresby - Domestic Apron Extension and Fire Tenders  22.9%  20.1 \nMount Hagen: Airport Upgrade and Terminal  18.9%  55.2 \n                                                 \n2  Time savings due to not having to overfly the airfield or await ground confirmation to check airport runway was \nclear of any hazards range from 20 to 30 minutes depending on weather conditions, time of day, and potential \nobstructions. Fifteen minutes was selected as a conservative figure. \n3 According to the PNG Tourism Promotion Authority\u2019s visitor expenditure survey in 2005 and 2007, increased \nregional  expenditure  can  be  expected  because  (i) improved  airport  facilities  would  mean  more-reliable  and \nmore-frequent service, which in turn would increase the length of passenger stay in the region; (ii) the development \nof market facilities at airports would generate increased \u201cimpact\u201d and \u201cconvenience\u201d expenditure in the region by \npassengers; and (iii) local authorities would undertake promotion efforts to encourage longer visit stay and \nincreased visitor expenditure.

In addition to the base case, the following four sensitivity test cases were examined: \n(i) the operation and maintenance costs increase by 20%, (ii) the benefits are reduced by 20%, \n(iii) the operation and maintenance costs increase by 20% and the benefits are reduced by \n20%, and (iv) the construction period lengthens by 1 year. Table A9.3 summarizes the EIRRs \nfor the base case and sensitivity cases. The project remains economically viable under the \nadverse scenarios tested. The economic viability is quite robust, because the EIRR values are \nwell above 12% in the sensitivity analysis cases. \n \nTable A9.3: Economic Internal Rate of Return Values for the Base \nCase and Sensitivity Analysis Cases \nEIRR \nScenario  (%) \nBase Case      45.3 \nSensitivity Tests       \n1.

A risk analysis was also undertaken to estimate the limits under which the project EIRR \nwould  fall  below  the  opportunity  cost  of  capital.  From  the  analysis,  it  was  estimated  that \nconstruction costs would need to be more than 200% higher or benefits would have to be \nreduced by more than 66% over the total period for the project to have an EIRR of less than \n12%.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n \n1.  The Government of Papua New Guinea (PNG) adopted the Medium Term Development Strategya (MTDS) 2005\u2013\n2010  as  its  strategic  framework  to  promote  national  development.  The  overarching  goals  of  MTDS  2005\u20132010  are: \nexport-driven economic growth, rural development, and poverty reduction, through good governance and the promotion of \nagriculture, forestry, fisheries, and tourism on a sustainable basis, among other means. Papua New Guineans, especially \nthose in rural areas, will be empowered to mobilize their own resources to improve their living standards. The key priorities for \nthe period to 2010 are: (i) rehabilitation and maintenance of transport infrastructure, (ii) promotion of income-earning \nopportunities, (iii) basic education and adult education, (iv) primary health care and HIV/AIDS prevention, and (v) law and \njustice.  \n \n2.  The country strategy and program for PNGb 2006\u22122010 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) supports the \nGovernment in meeting its MTDS goals. ADB and the Government have agreed that the strategic areas that clearly satisfy the \nprinciples and lessons learned are: (i) public financial management, (ii) private sector development, (iii) the transport sector, \nand (iv) health and HIV/AIDS. In the transport sector, the Civil Aviation Development Investment Program upgrading of 21 \nnational airports is one of the top priorities of the Government.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                 Targeting Classification:  General intervention \n1. Key Issues  \n \nPoverty in PNG is overwhelmingly rural, and urban\u2013rural income disparities are widening, as are disparities between \ncommunities within and outside of the enclave resource projects. Poverty is about three times more severe in rural than in \nurban areas, and varies in severity across rural regions, with about 75% of the poor living in the Sepik and Highlands regions. \nBetween 1996 and 2003, the number of Papua New Guineans living below $1 per day is estimated to have doubled from 1.1 \nto 2.2 million (World Bank Socio Impact Study 2007). The poverty headcount index, for the $1 poverty line, was about 39.4% \nin 2003, up from 24.6 % in 1996. An estimated 70% of the population now live on less than $2 per day, up from 54% in 1996 \n(provincial development data).  \n \nThe investment program will cover the upgrading of 21 airports nationwide, including Buka, Chimbu, Daru, Goroka, Gurney, \nHoskins, Kavieng, Kerema, Kiunga, Mendi, Momote, Madang, Mount Hagen, Lae (Nadzab), Popendetta, Port Moresby, Tari, \nTokua, Vanimo, Wapenamanda, and Wewak. As the project areas have nationwide coverage, the investment program has \nthe potential to affect the whole population. The first tranche, which covers five provinces (National Capital, Western \nHighlands, East Sepik, West New Britain, and Milne Bay), has the potential to serve a population of up to 1,586,978 people. \n \nThe poverty levels in the five provinces under project 1 are shown below: \n \nTable A10: Poverty Levels \n  Human   \n  Human  Development  Gender-Related \nProvince  Poverty Index  Index  Development \nNational Capital  14.5  0.758  0.506 \nWestern Highlands  55.5  0.282  0.261 \nEast Sepik  47.3  0.304  0.282 \nWest New Britain  31.9  0.394  0.388 \nMilne Bay  31.4  0.420  0.387 \nSource: Papua New Guinea Census 2000. \n \nAs shown in the table, the human poverty index in East Sepik and Western Highlands of the provinces are below the national \nhuman poverty index (39.4%). In addition to low incomes, a 2001 participatory poverty assessment (funded by ADB) clearly \nindicates the non-income dimensions of poverty in PNG: specifically, people consider themselves poor when they lack (i) jobs, \n(ii) land, (iii) education, (iv) services such as health and water, and (v) transport and roads. The most pressing needs are safe \n ", "58  Appendix 10 \ndrinking water and usable roads. While available data are limited and in need of updating, the risks of a rapid rise in poverty \nlevels in PNG are clear. The salient issues include: \n \n(i)  In 1997, 37% of the population lived below the poverty line of K461 per year. A further 17% of the population was \nunable to meet the basic food requirement of 2,200 calories per day per adult equivalent. In terms of the international \npoverty line, one-quarter of the people in PNG lived on less than $1 a day; 54% lived on less than $2 a day. \n(ii)  Because of poor economic performance combined  with rapid population growth, the incidence of poverty is \nestimated to have nearly doubled in the period 1996\u20132003 from 37.5% to 53.8%. It is estimated that 40% of the PNG \npopulation lived on less than $1 a day in 2003, while 70% were below the level of $2 a day. \n(iii)  Poverty is concentrated in rural areas. The rural poverty rate (41%) is significantly higher than the urban rate (16%). \nThe Highlands region, with 40% of the national population and a poverty rate (1996) of 38.3%, is one of the poorest \nregions in the country. \n(iv)  The highest poverty levels occur among households with little or no cash income, that is, families that rely primarily \non subsistence agriculture, hunting, gathering, and fishing to meet household consumption needs. However, poverty \nis also high among farmers that grow and sell tree and other cash crops. Overall, people involved in the agriculture \nsector account for 86% of the poor. \n(v)  Households headed by women are among the poorest in rural areas of PNG. \n \n2. Design Features  \n \nThe investment program will contribute to rural development and poverty reduction. Improved airport facilitates will increase \nthe mobility and access of people to markets and other natural resources. People living in the project areas will directly benefit \nfrom job opportunities through the required civil works and maintenance, market upgrading, and increase in various business \n(in particular, tourism) opportunities. The investment program design includes: (i) priorities for the employment of local men \nand women in the upgrading of airport facilities and maintenance, (ii) the upgrading of a market at each airport site, \n(iii) contractor specifications for the provision of HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention programs for construction workers and \nneighboring communities, and (iv) an extensive community relations and participation program linked to different aspects of \ntranche  preparation  and  implementation  through  a  full-time  community  relations  officer  (CRO)  under  the  project \nimplementation unit (PIU). The consultations with communities during project preparatory technical assistance strongly \nsupported market upgrading to directly benefit them. The primary beneficiaries of the program will be airport users and local \ncommunities  at  each  project  site  including  airport  market  vendors  (especially  women  selling  vegetables,  food,  and \nhandicrafts). The secondary beneficiaries would include public transport service industries and tourism-associated industries. \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nKey Issues \nThere are more than 800 languages in PNG. With a land area of nearly 463,000 square kilometers and a population \nexceeding 6 million (2007 estimate), Papua New Guinea is the largest developing country in the South Pacific region. The \npopulation is growing at an annual rate of about 2.7%, and nearly half of the population is 19 years of age or younger. Most \nPapua New Guineans live in rural communities based on traditional village social structures and dependent on subsistence \nagriculture supplemented by cash cropping. Less than 15% live in urban areas, although migration to cities and towns in the \npast decade has contributed to substantial urban unemployment and accompanying social problems. Livelihoods of people in \nthe project 1 airport site areas combine subsistence agriculture (sweet potatoes and tapioca), cash cropping (coffee, cocoa \nand coconut, and livestock raising (pigs and chicken). Household incomes from sales of agricultural products or other local \nmarket sales are generally very small. \n \nThroughout PNG (Highlands, Coastal, and Islands), people live on their clan territory. In the Highlands, small hamlets of 4\u201310 \nclosely related households (or subclans) are more common. In the coastal and island communities, it is more common for \npeople from several clans to live together in villages. An extended family of 10\u201315 adults and their children will generally live \non at least 2\u20133 hectares and have up to 5 hectares of agricultural land. \n \nWhile primary enrollment is relatively high, retention of girls is a major problem. This was clearly evident in the socio-gender \neconomic survey findings in the four airport site communities. Girls\u2019 share of the secondary school enrollment ratio in PNG \nwas just 23% in 2005, and only 1% of those who enter grade 1 will also enter a tertiary institution. In rural situations, high \nschools are often residential and the number of dormitory spaces limits girls\u2019 educational opportunities. The female adult \nliteracy rate is only 51%, and women\u2019s ability to function effectively, gain access to services, and support their families is \nfurther constrained by the multilingual nature of the country. \n \nPNG has 90% of the HIV/AIDS cases in the Pacific and is considered to have a full-blown epidemic with case numbers \nincreasing by 30% yearly. As of 2005, there were 14,276 cases of HIV/AIDS, more than half of which were women. There is a ", "Appendix 10  59 \nhigh level of stigma attached to HIV/AIDS and to those who act as caregivers\u2014primarily women\u2014which inhibits testing and \nreporting (Papua New Guinea Pacific Gender Profile, 2008). Although the investment program will have a positive impact on \nPNG, it also has the potential to increase the spread of HIV/AIDS through air connectivity. According to the 6-monthly \nsurveillance reports on sexually transmitted infections (STI) and HIV/AIDS prepared in 2008 by the National Department of \nHealth and funded by ADB, the number of reported cases by gender and province show Western Highlands to have the \nhighest number (35.2%), followed by the National Capital District (16.7%), Eastern Highlands (13%), and Morobe (13%). The \nother airport provinces had the following reported cases: West New Britain, 0.1%; East Sepik Province, 2.9%; and Milne Bay, \n0.3%.  STI/HIV mitigation involving prevention and safety measures for construction workers and neighbor communities are \nincorporated in the design and implementation stages of the investment program. \n \nImproved airports are expected to foster rural development, reduce poverty, and increase accessibility to health and \neducation services. It is envisaged that the investment program will result in the lowering of airfares because of increased \ncompetition and volume of travelers. \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nAn extensive program of consultations, women\u2019s focus group discussions, and questionnaire surveys took place during the \npreparation of the investment program. An initial extensive program of consultation has taken place. During the project \npreparatory technical assistance fact-finding stage, a stakeholder analysis was carried out to identify the major important \nstakeholders, their interest in the proposed program, their perceptions of current problems related to safety and security \nassociated with airport operations, passenger terminal logistics, and civil aviation services, and the resources they could bring \nto the achievement of goals and objectives of the program. Meetings have been held at the national level with Civil Aviation \nAuthority (CAA), Ministry of Transport (MOT), the Dept. of National Planning and Monitoring, the Dept. of Treasury, Air Niugini \nAirlines, Airlines of PNG, PNG Air Services Ltd., PNG Airports Ltd., and the Australian Agency for International Development \n(AusAID) and its Transport Sector Support Program (TSSP). \n \nAt the loan preparation stage, another stakeholder analysis was carried out to identify the secondary stakeholders, their \nsupport for the proposed program, their perceptions of current problems related to airport use and affordability, as well as their \ncurrent benefits and potential benefits from upgrading. Further consultations were organized with relevant development \npartners and  stakeholders such  as AusAID, UN  agencies, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), international  NGOs \n(INGOs), women\u2019s groups, and community-based organizations (CBOs). Community consultation meetings were organized \nwith local stakeholders and business houses in Wewak (East Sepik Province), Hoskins area (West New Britain Province), \nMount  Hagen  (Western  Highlands  Province),  and  Gurney  in  Alotau  (Milne  Bay  Province)  with  provincial  and  district \nadministrators participating. These meetings targeted current users and potential beneficiaries of the airport improvements to \nfind out their views on affordability and other social benefits. \n \nFor the project 1 airports, the views of the communities living close to the airports have been sought through small sample \nsurveys of households (120 households), and the market and informal sectors (25 persons), as well a program of community \nconsultations in that brought together up to 20 people in each of 8 communities and women\u2019s focus groups (10\u201315 women \neach) in 8 villages. \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \n \nUnder the investment program PIU, a full-time CRO will be hired and, in collaboration with the environmental officer, will \nestablish a consultation program for each tranche airport project. The purpose is (i) to inform communities about the \ninvestment program and, in detail, about the airport upgrading works; (ii) to provide information about the expected benefits \nand potential  adverse impact, as  well  as project measures such  as compensation, environmental management, and \ncommunity-based initiatives; (iii) to provide a platform for communities to participate in the upgrade and express their \ninterests, preferences, and concerns; and (iv) in general, to facilitate different aspects of the implementation of the tranche \nprojects. Consultations with communities will take place at different points in the planning and implementation of subprojects \nand include: \n \n(i)  In the initial stages of airport works preparation, the community liaison officer of the investment program PIU \nwill consult with communities as part of the process of confirming that the airport meets the eligibility criteria \nto be included in the investment program. The support of communities is a key criterion, along with \npreliminary assessments regarding the potential scope of additional land requirements, existing land tenure, \nand any other adverse social and environmental impact. \n \n \n ", "60  Appendix 10 \n(ii)  During the preparation of the subsequent tranches, the investment program will organize or assist other \nparties  (e.g.,  provincial  land  officers,  environmental  consultants)  in  organizing  various  consultations, \nawareness programs, and surveys that form part of the work (a) to conduct an environmental assessment of \nthe airport, and (b) to identify additional land requirements for the extension of airport runways and facilities, \nas needed, to prepare a resettlement plan. \n(iii)  During the preparation and implementation of the subsequent tranches, the investment program will \norganize or assist other parties (e.g., provincial land officers, independent monitoring organization, social \nmonitoring consultant) in organizing consultations, awareness programs, and surveys, which will also form \npart of the work on: (a) acquisition of additional land, (b) independent monitoring of land acquisition \nactivities, (c) environmental monitoring work, and (d) baseline and follow-up studies as part of the social \nmonitoring study.  \n(iv)  Throughout the work on all the tranches, the CRO or environment officers from the investment program will \nmeet periodically with communities to find out whether there are social, environmental, or other issues that \nrequire attention, for example, in relation to opportunities for community-based maintenance or resolution of \ngrievances. These consultations will occur according to a program agreed on with communities or on an ad \nhoc basis. \n \nConsultations with communities at airport locations will be designed not only to inform people about specific activities related \nto its preparation and implementation, but also to enable people in the community to ask questions, make suggestions, state \npreferences, and express concerns. The investment program community liaison officer will work with the community leaders \nto organize meetings with the community. Although different meetings may target specific stakeholders (e.g., affected \ngroups), the investment program and community leaders will encourage all members of the community to participate. Special \nattention will be paid to the participation of women and any other vulnerable groups. Because women are less likely to \ncontribute to meetings that involve the entire community, the investment program will ensure that women\u2019s focus groups are \norganized to obtain their views, preferences, and concerns where relevant. \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues  \nLevels of development for women vary drastically depending on geographic isolation, history of contact with colonizers, \nmatrilineal or paterlineal culture of the group, quality of governance at the provincial level, and levels of service delivery and \ninfrastructure. In general, for the 21 national airports sites of the investment program in reference to gender and development \nshow strong patriarchal structures where male dominance is influential. However, there are some instances of matrilineal \nstructures (where females by customary rights lead and own land) particularly in the New Guinea island provinces. According \nto the literature and review of the gender socioeconomic data in the airport sites, these matriarchal values are being \ndestroyed by intermarriage and the stronger influence of the patriarchal structures. This means that women in these provinces \nare  not  proactively  participating  in  project  cycles  (planning,  design,  implementation,  and  monitoring),  especially  in \ndecision-making roles, but play secondary roles within the periphery of semi-unskilled labor. There are, however, some \ninfluential women in decision-making roles (2%) that can take proactive roles. The CAA, through the investment program, \nencourages the hiring of women as engineers or managers for the required civil works to comply with the Government's  \ngender strategy. \n \nMoreover, according to the findings of the socio-impact studies and women\u2019s focus group meetings in the five airport site \nprovinces, the majority of the grassroots women (90%) do not currently use the airport and related facilities in their daily lives. \nA few (10%) who have small businesses to earn extra income can afford to travel at least once or twice a year to visit \nrelatives, but the majority of the women said that the fares were too expensive for them to travel. The women suggested that \nthe development of a bigger airport market by the investment program would greatly induce them to come and sell their goods \nto generate extra income for their basic needs. \n \nWomen are constrained from engaging in private sector activity and small business by their lack of access to credit and \nbanking facilities. This lack of access is, in turn, linked to their lack of control over property and productive resources. Even in \nmatrilineal areas where land registration has been introduced (East and West New Britain), women report that brothers take \non the role of signatories and then override the guidance of female relatives who have cultural inheritance rights to land. On a \npositive note, government, NGOs, and donors are collaborating to enhance and increase microfinance for women in PNG, \nand are providing training in the use of credit and savings. \n \nViolence against women and girls is epidemic in PNG. It contravenes their human rights, contributes to the spread of \nHIV/AIDS, negatively affects women\u2019s and children\u2019s mental health, and undermines women\u2019s social freedoms, productivity, \nand contribution to national development. Violence against women has been a recognized development issue for decades, \nand donors have funded significant high-quality work since the 1980s. However, without the political will and commitment to \naction in the police, military, and judicial systems, law reform proposals, policy initiatives, and public awareness campaigns \ncan have only a minor ameliorative effect and women will still be afraid to report cases of violence. The investment program \naddresses the health and safety issues as one of the project assurances. ", "Appendix 10  61 \n2.  Key Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and \nuse of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n    Gender plan          Other actions/measures         No action/measure \n \n3. Gender Action Plan: Proposed Airport Market  \n \nThe investment program outcome will positively influence gender equality and empowerment of women in varying degrees \ndepending on the context of the project cycle. For instance, the increase in job opportunities from airport upgrading will \nincrease household incomes and, in turn, increase education for all and health-care services, in particular for children and \nwomen, who are the primary users of health services. The program will also increase access to better airport markets, which \nwill help rural women generate extra income to meet their basic food, health, educational, and transport needs. In general, the \ngender-socioeconomic baseline data and qualitative findings gathered around the airport site communities indicated alarming \npoverty levels. This implies a greater need in these communities to earn extra income. Having an airport market will also \npromote tourism, giving extra income to the communities. \n \nAs noted above, the CAA construction and maintenance work will create opportunities for employment. It is important to \nencourage women to be involved in skilled areas and decision-making roles (as managers and engineers) rather than just \nnon-skilled and service-type work. This reinforces the gender-stereotyped attitudes dominant in Papua New Guinea, a \nconstraint on women\u2019s advancement. In resettlement plans, for example, women must be consulted (100%) to ensure they, \nand not only the men, have legal property and inheritance rights, income, and assets rights. \n \nIn the planning and preparation stages, it is crucial for women to be proactively involved in the decision-making committees at \nall levels (institutional, national, provincial, community, and local level). In the case of a market proposal, for example, it is \nimportant that users are consulted. In particular, women need to be involved in the design stage as main market users. The \nactivities to reinforce project outcome and outputs will incorporate specific features, strategies, targets, indicators, and \nbenchmarks to facilitate both men\u2019s and women\u2019s active participation in decision making (CAA and PIU). This will include \ngender-responsive policy measures. \nIII.

The Government of Papua New Guinea has taken up a plan to improve the current state \nof  the  country\u2019s  domestic  air  transport  system  under  the  Civil  Aviation  Development  and \nInvestment Program. Five major airports (project 1) in the country have been identified mainly \non the basis of the relative importance of these airports as domestic hubs for tourism and \neconomic development on a regional basis. An initial environmental examination (IEE) was \nprepared for each airport project on the basis of the available preliminary design information. \nThe  investment  program  has  been  classified  as  category  B  in  accordance  with  the \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines (2003) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the \nGovernment\u2019s environmental requirements. The Government\u2019s Environment Act (2000) uses the \nEnvironment (Prescribed Activities) Regulation (2002), which designates projects that need \nenvironmental assessment as \u201cprescribed activities.\u201d The upgrading or rehabilitation of airports \nis not listed among the \u201cprescribed activities\u201d and would not require an environmental permit. \nThe Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) has, however, advised that certain \nactivities may require an environmental permit depending on their duration and scale. The Civil \nAviation Authority (CAA) will disclose to DEC the scale and scope of future subprojects to \ndetermine the requirements under the Environment Act (2000). Environmental assessments will \nbe prepared for future subprojects according to the prepared environmental assessment review \nframework (EARF). \nB.  Description of the Investment Program \n2.  The proposed program involves the upgrading or rehabilitation of the project 1 airports: \n(i) Wewak, (ii) Hoskins, (iii) Gurney, (iv) Mount Hagen, and (v) Jackson\u2019s domestic airport \n(Table A11). It is designed to meet international safety standards and provide sufficient runway \nlength for unrestricted operations of F100 jet aircraft or equivalent aircraft. The program includes \ninstitutional strengthening and capacity building to support the strategic management of aviation \ndevelopment while improving environmental management. The multitranche financing facility \n(MFF) is expected to be released in four tranches.  \n \nTable A11: Investment Program \n \nSubproject/Location/Proposed Development Works \nWewak Airport \nEast Sepik Province \nExtend runway length by 200 m, from existing 1,600 m to 1,800 m \nRetain runway width of 30 m similar to existing  \nConstruct extension strip width of 150 m (mark 90 m to match existing) \nExtension surfacing: prime and 3x coat seal (10 mm/7 mm/sand) similar to existing condition \nRealign Perigo Road \nRealign existing large storm water drain \nConstruct bridge over Brandi Road at realigned storm water drain \nExtend car park at rear of terminal building \nLop infringing trees in golf course to clear the approach/take-off path \nSupply, install and commission a new PAPI landing aid system \nHoskins Airport \nWest New Britain Province \nWiden the existing runway from 30 m to 45 m \nConstruct a 90 m end of runway safety zone (RESA) at southeast end, and stop ways at both ends \nWiden the existing flight strip to 150 m \nReplace all open drains within the strip with piping systems \nRelocate a precision approach path indicator (PAPI) visual guidance system at the southeast end to the new touchdown point \nWiden the taxiway shoulders to 5 m \n ", "64  Appendix 11 \nSubproject/Location/Proposed Development Works \nDesign the apron to provide for two F-100 parking positions \nReinstate pavement markings \nMount Hagen Airport \nWestern Highlands Province \nStrengthen the pavements to the main runway, taxiways, and apron \nLengthen runway by 110 m at the western end \nConstruct 3 m\u2013wide full strength asphalt surfaced shoulders on each side of the main runway \nSurfacing of the strengthened aircraft pavements and new shoulders to runway with dense graded asphalt and runway grooved \nWiden main runway strip from 90 m to 150 m wide \nReconstruct sealed stopways 60 m x 30 m\u2013wide at each end of the  strengthened runway \nReconstruction of 90 m x 90 m RESAs beyond the stopways at each end of the runway \nFlank earthworks to match raised levels of aircraft pavements \nInstall new lighting systems to the main runway \nStrengthen the pavements to the secondary runway \nReinstate all pavement markings \nAdjustments to the PAPI Landing Aid System at the end of runways \nGurney Airport \nMilne Bay Province \nExtend the eastern end runway by 160 m x 30 m to a total 1,850 m \nConstruction of a new 60 m stopway at the eastern end  \nConstruction of 90 m x 90 m RESA at both runway ends \nApply single coat 7 mm chip reseal to existing pavements and reinstate fuel resistance membrane and line markings \nDiversion of the existing open unlined drains (OUD) at the Eastern end and install a new culvert under the RFFS access road \nInstall a new multi-cell culvert under the plantation access road \nRelocate existing PAPI at the eastern end and conduct flight test \nJackson\u2019s Airport \nNational Capital District \nExtend domestic apron by 162 m long x 80 m\u2013wide at the NW end \nConstruct new stub taxiway connecting the new extended Apron to the existing parallel taxiway.

Description of the Environment \n3.  Papua New Guinea (PNG) is the largest of all Pacific Island nations with a land area of \n460,000 square kilometers, a population of 5.7 million, and an average population density of \n12 persons per square kilometer. The climate is generally hot and humid, with temperatures \nranging from 23oC (day) to 12oC (night). Air quality is good, and water pollution, caused by \nunregulated runoff from industrial activities and the direct dumping of wastes, i.e., domestic \nwaste and sewage into river systems, is common. Water resources are abundant, with an \nestimated total renewable water resource per capita of 159,171 cubic meters per person in \n2002. About 29% of the population has access to safe drinking water. The forests of PNG are \nthe  third-largest  block  of  intact  tropical  forest  in  the  world,  estimated  at  26.1\u201333.0  million \nhectares. HIV/AIDS is a major concern, with infection rates at 50,000 persons and a potential \ninfection rate of 30% of the total population within 10 years. ", "Appendix 11  65 \nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impact and Mitigation Measures \n  1.  Impact Associated with Planning, Location, and Design \n4.  Project 1 will involve the upgrading or rehabilitation of existing airports. The works will be \ndone within existing property or on state land. No adverse impact is anticipated from the design \nor the siting (existing airports) of the proposed projects. The requirements in the contract will \ninclude  full  implementation  of  the  EMP,  with  the  CAA  preparing  resources  to  fulfill  the \nrequirements of the law and guiding the contractors in environmental management.  \n  2.  Environmental Impact of Construction Activities \n5.  The subprojects will be improved within existing airport property and with minimal land \nclearing. The physical impact will be from earthworks, noise, and potential impact on surface \nwater. Water quality impact such as that from fuels, lubricants, and solid waste stockpiles can \nbe avoided through proper storage and disposal, and the siting of camps, borrow areas, and \nancillary facilities away from water bodies and at least 500 meters away from the settlements \nand forest areas with water and sanitation. Contractors will submit site EMPs describing the \nimplementation of mitigation measures, the location of borrow areas, and provisions for the \ndisposal of excess excavation materials. Laborers will be hired from local communities or other \nparts of the province to the extent possible. \n  3.  Environmental Impact of Operations \n6.  Environmental impact during operation will come from neglect of mitigation measures, \nparticularly wastes and pollution, noise, and airport accidents. The sewage system will be \nmaintained in good condition, and possibly connected to nearby main lines or, when required, a \nsewage system will be established. Procedures and facilities for the handling of fuels, lubricants, \nand other chemicals (normal airport operations and aircraft maintenance) will be established; \nfuel and sediment traps will be installed in drain entries to capture accidental spills; and a \nmonitoring system will be included in the EMP to mitigate the possible contamination of soils, \ngroundwater, and waterways. A solid waste management system will be developed for the \nairport  operation,  and  proper  sanitation  and  sewerage  facilities  will  be  constructed.  Noise \nexposure levels will be monitored and planning rules developed for the construction of dwellings \nwithin the noise exposure footprint, and the location and timing of ground running of aircraft.  \nE.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Management Plan \n7.  Effective implementation of the EMP requires an institutional setting, framework and \ninformation flows. CAA, the executing agency of the investment program, will work with the \nprogram implementation unit (PIU) to monitor the environmental aspects of design, contracting, \nmobilization, and construction. The PIU will be responsible for the daily implementation of the \nprogram through program support consultants, including an international environment specialist \n(engaged intermittently for a total of 8 months over the program period) and national expert \ninput of 96 months. The international environment specialist, who will report to the program \ndirector of the PIU, will be tasked to: (i) strengthen the environmental management of the \nprogram  during  detailed  design,  bidding,  contracting,  construction,  and  implementation; \n(ii) supervise and guide the environmental assessment process for all subprojects under the \nMFF; (iii) supervise the implementation of the EMPs for subprojects; and (iv) undertake the \n ", "66  Appendix 11 \nnecessary institutional strengthening including on-the-job training for the environment officer of \nthe  CAA.  The  CAA,  through  PIU,  will  notify  DEC  through  the  submission  of  subproject \nnotification in the prescribed format, and endorse environmental assessments required prior to \nthe implementation of the subproject packages. It will also ensure that all mitigation measures in \nthe EMPs are implemented by the contractors for the subprojects. The EARF will include a \ngeneral  description  of  the  anticipated  environmental  impact,  screening  and  classification \nprocedures and environmental assessment of subprojects in future tranches, and compliance \nwith  all  PNG  statutory  requirements.  EMP  implementation  during  the  works  will  be  the \nresponsibility  of  the  contractor,  who  must  (i)  incorporate  environmental  safeguards  in  the \ntechnical  specifications,  (ii)  have  the  EMP  reviewed  before  the  start  of  construction,  and \n(iii) monitor and report to the PIU in the course of the works. \nF.  Public Consultation and Disclosure \n8.  Public consultations were carried out in May 2009. Persons consulted included local \nresidents, community leaders, and local officials to present the proposed program, elicit issues \nand concerns among the people in the impact area that may be relevant to the proposed \ndevelopment, and discuss ADB\u2019s environmental requirement for programs of this type. The \nparticipants  in  the  public  consultations  were  unanimous  in  their  support  for  the  proposed \ndevelopment and will not interpose any objection to its implementation. Major priorities raised by \nthe stakeholders during the public consultations were employment and livelihood opportunities \nfor qualified village folk, the provision of a potable water supply system, and the construction of \nmarketplaces in villages within the periphery of the subproject airports. \nG.  Findings and Recommendations \n9.  The  IEE  reports  on  the  various  subprojects  provided  assessments  of  the  potential \nenvironmental impact associated with project 1 and the mitigation measures. The development \nwill not cause any significant environmental impact as all the works will be undertaken within the \nexisting airport boundary. The responsibilities for the implementation of mitigation measures are \nindicated in the IEE and EMP and will be clearly defined in contracts and agreements, which will \nbe monitored by the environment officer of the CAA. The implementation of the mitigation \nmeasures during construction will be assigned to the contractors and included in the contracts. \nThe IEE and EMP and conditions included as part of the environmental compliance from the \nDEC will be the basis for environmental compliance in a regular program of environmental \nmonitoring and auditing. Considering the above, the IEE reports prepared for the five airports \ncan be finalized as the environmental assessment of the investment program. \nH.  Environmental Assessment and Review Framework \n10.  The  executing  agency  of  the  investment  program  will  be  the  CAA,  which  will  be \nresponsible  for  the  implementation  of  the  EARF  including  the  preparation  of  IEE/SIEE  or \nEIA/SEIA (if warranted). The environmental assessment reports with environmental clearance \nfrom DEC (as necessary) will be submitted to ADB together with the periodic financing request \nfor  review  and  approval  before  the  finalization  of  contracts  or  the  start  of  work.  Public \nconsultations will also be carried out and CAA will submit the required documentation to ADB. \nThe PIU in CAA will ensure that appropriate environmental assessment reports (with EMPs) are \nsubmitted to ADB in time for review and approval before the contracts are finalized or work \nbegins. The PIU will also ensure that the EMP and all required mitigation measures during \nconstruction are included in the contractors\u2019 contracts, with requirements to update the EMP in ", "Appendix 11  67 \nresponse to any unexpected impact and fully implement the EMP during construction. During \nthe implementation of the MFF, ADB will review the environmental assessment reports for \nsubsequent  subproject  approvals,  disclose  environmental  assessments,  where  necessary, \nbefore a periodic financing request is submitted to ADB, and monitor EMP implementation and \nconduct due diligence as part of MFF reviews. ADB will assist the CAA in carrying out its \nresponsibilities and to build capacity and ensure that it conducts the required consultations with \nproject-affected groups and local nongovernment organizations. An EARF has been prepared \nthat presents the general anticipated environmental impact, subproject selection criteria, and \nsubproject environmental procedure as guide for the preparation and approval of environmental \nassessments of future projects to be financed under the investment program.  \nI.  Conclusion \n11.  The IEE reports for the subproject packages have assessed the potential environmental \nimpact from the subprojects under project 1 to be temporary, reversible, and easily mitigated \nwith available methods. The mitigation measures proposed in the IEE/EMP for the subprojects \nare sufficient. At the implementation stage, CAA will monitor the implementation of mitigation \nmeasures and monitoring programs specified in each IEE/EMP. With these measures in place, \nit is predicted that all potential environmental impact can be mitigated to insignificant levels; as \nsuch, no further impact assessment is considered necessary. A semiannual report on EMP \nimplementation will be submitted to ADB and the relevant government agencies. Environmental \nassessment  will  be  required  for  all  subprojects  in  future  tranches.  EARF  will  guide  the \nenvironmental  management  of  the  overall  program  and  the  environmental  assessment  of \nindividual subprojects in the future. \n \n ", "68  Appendix 12   \n \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n1.  The resettlement framework for the investment program and the due diligence report \n(DDR)  for  each  project  1  airport  site  were  prepared  in  compliance  with  the  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). These documents provide \nguidance in establishing the policies and procedures for compensating affected people for lost \nor damaged assets. The resettlement framework is based on the principles established in ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy and relevant sections of the Operations Manual (as updated in \n2006). The resettlement framework will be the basis and will guide the Civil Aviation Authority \n(CAA) in preparing and implementing the resettlement issues for the program. At the beginning \nof each tranche, the policies and provisions of the resettlement framework will be reviewed and, \nas required, updated to reflect the conditions and requirements for upgrading airports, but \nwithout lowering the standards set out in the present resettlement framework. The DDR will be \nupdated,  if  necessary,  on  the  basis  of  the  detailed  engineering  design  during  loan \nimplementation. \n2.  The  Government  of  Papua  New  Guinea  had  originally  acquired  land  for  the \nestablishment of national airports from customary ownership. To all extent possible, civil works \nproposed under the investment program, including the upgrading and extension of runway, will \nbe undertaken within the existing airport boundary (CAA-/state-owned land); therefore, very \nlimited land acquisition for the program is expected. However, there will be both permanent and \ntemporary resettlement issues to be solved under the program\u2019s subsequent tranches.  \n3.  It is therefore expected that the potential number of people that will experience the \nincidental impact of the upgrading of airports under the program will be small, and well within \nthe category of \u201cminor\u201d or \u201cno significant resettlement impact\u201d under ADB\u2019s policy. A screening \nof the four airport sites under project 1 has been undertaken. The program is currently classified \nas category B with respect to involuntary resettlement. \n4.  The  Government  through  CAA,  has  agreed  to  expedite the  implementation  of the \ninvestment plan. In cases where additional land is required to upgrade and extend airport \nrunways under the investment program, the land acquisition will be done through a process of \nstate alienation of customary land according to the Land Act of 1996, led by the Department of \nLands and Physical Planning. However, as this process is usually lengthy, CAA is examining \nthe benefits of expediting land acquisition through a memorandum of agreement (MOA). This \nprocess was used by the Department of Works in acquiring land for the Highlands Road \nImprovement Project. The MOA will be prepared after the land is valued. Therefore, it will \nindicate the compensation amount. \n5.  The MOA will be the interim means of securing the land to allow upgrading works to \ncontinue while the process of land acquisition as stipulated in the Land Act continues. When the \nland acquisition process is complete, the acquired land will be leased to the CAA, and the MOA \nwill  be  superseded.  Under  the  Land  Act,  affected  people  will  be  compensated  for  land; \nindividuals and households with assets on the land will be compensated for any damage to or \nloss of these assets by the State through agreements with tribal owners. \n6.  The program entitlement matrix was prepared as a part of the resettlement framework \n(Supplementary Appendix G). Affected people will be compensated for any loss of or damage to \nland, crops, trees, temporary structures, or other assets, according to the policies stated in this \nresettlement  framework.  All  costs  of  the  investment  program  related  to  land  acquisition, \n ", "Appendix 12  69 \n \ncompensation and allowances, operation and administration, surveys, monitoring, and reporting \nwill be financed by CAA through the Government using counterpart funds.  \n7.  All people who own crops, trees, temporary structures, or other assets on affected land \nare entitled to compensation for the loss of or damage to these assets. Compensation will be \npaid in cash at replacement cost. In addition to compensation, affected persons are entitled to \nassistance,  for  example,  in  shifting  temporary  informal  market  structures  for  disrupted \nbusinesses. Affected persons will also be given priority in employment in the program civil works \nand ongoing maintenance.  \n8.  The investment program will monitor and report semiannually to the CAA and ADB on \nall activities associated with the establishment of MOA and the payment of compensation to \naffected persons. The scope of internal monitoring includes: (i) compliance with the agreed \npolicies  and  procedures;  (ii)  prompt  approval,  allocation,  and  disbursement  of  funds,  and \npayment  of  compensation  to  affected  persons,  including  supplemental  compensation  for \nadditional or unforeseen losses; (iii) the availability of other resources and efficient, effective use \nof these resources; and (iv) requirement for remedial actions. \n9.  The  CAA  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  will  recruit  a  local  social  safeguard \nspecialist to independently conduct external monitoring of the program subprojects. The person \nwill be based at the PIU and will be supported by a community liaison officer (CLO). The \nspecialist  will  be  mobilized  at  the  beginning  of  project  1  of  the  investment  program.  An \nindependent monitor under the social safeguards section will be responsible for reporting to the \nPIU,  CAA,  and  ADB  on  all  activities  related  to  additional  land  requirements,  community \nconsultations, preparation of resettlement plans, and payment of compensation. The external \nmonitoring will focus on the social impact of the subprojects and the ability of the affected \npersons to restore, and preferably improve, their pre-project living standards, incomes, and \nproductive capacity.  \n10.  Consultations  will  be  carried  out  at  different  points  in  the  preparation  and \nimplementation of tranche projects, as part of the process of negotiating the MOA. With support \nfrom  the  PIU,  CAA,  local  government  ward  councilors,  and  relevant  local  authorities,  the \ninvestment  program  will  organize  consultations  with  affected  communities.  Participants  will \ninclude appointed and traditional leaders in the village, affected landowners, and community \npeople affected by the loss of assets on the affected land. Village leaders will encourage all \nother community members, including women, elderly people, young people, and disadvantaged \nmembers of the community, to attend. Because of cultural barriers, women are often reluctant to \nspeak at community meetings. Where relevant, separate meetings may be held with them to \nunderstand  and  discuss  their  preferences  and  concerns.  Where  indigenous  people  or  a \nlinguistic  group  requires  translation  assistance,  the  investment  program  will  ensure  that  a \ntranslator  or  translated  materials  are  provided  to  ensure  that  the  particular  group  has  full \nunderstanding of the resettlement issues and process of compensation. \n11.  The key consultations will occur before or during the project works. There will be \n(i) screening and preparation of the subprojects within each tranche; (ii) MOA negotiation, an \nasset survey, and social surveys; (iii) disclosure and review of the draft resettlement plan; and \n(iv) land  ownership  investigation  and  preparation  of  land  investigation  reports  (LIRs).  The \ninvestment program and the social specialist will consult with communities and affected people \non  related  issues,  as  required,  throughout  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  tranche \nprojects. Throughout these consultations, the objectives are (i) to provide timely and complete \ninformation  about  the  project,  land  requirements,  and  impact,  to  enable  people  to  make \n ", "70  Appendix 12 \n \ninformed decisions; (ii) to ensure that all affected people and other interested stakeholders know \nand understand the policies and procedures related to additional land requirement for the \nupgrading of the airports; and (iii) to build and maintain community support for the investment \nprogram  by  addressing  the  concerns  and  preferences  of  affected  people  and  other \nstakeholders. The resettlement plan will be disclosed according to ADB policies. \n12.  Program grievance redress mechanisms will be established to ensure that all affected \npersons\u2019 grievances related to any aspect of land acquisition or compensation for affected \nassets are resolved in a timely and satisfactory manner. The CLO is the first step to addressing \ngrievances. The grievance redress mechanism will apply equally to the negotiation of the MOA. \nAffected persons will be made fully aware of their rights (both orally and in writing) during \nconsultations about land requirements for the CAA airports. The mechanisms will be based on \nthe provisions of the Land Disputes Settlement Act, using the CLO as a first step in the tradition \nof local mediation that is used throughout PNG. The participation of appointed and traditional \nleaders will be promoted to achieve satisfactory resolution of issues at the local level. In the \nevent that grievances cannot be resolved through local mediation, the matter will be referred to \nthe land court system. In this case, the program and the district lands officer will hold the \ncompensation amounts in a trust fund. Compensation will be paid in full upon final resolution of \nthe case in the courts or other forum, in accordance with the entitlements of the affected person. \n13.  The CAA, as executing agency for the investment program, has overall responsibility to \nmanage the planning, implementation, and monitoring related to the acquisition of use rights for \nadditional land to implement airport safety standards, as well as compensation for damage on \nairport-affected land. Once again, CAA will let the Department of Lands and Physical Planning \nprepare  the  LIRs  for  state  alienation  of  land.  Local  authorities,  including  the  provincial \ngovernment,  district  administrators,  and  local  government  ward  councilors,  will  assist  the \nprogram  (and  the  Department  of  Land  and  Physical  Planning)  by  leading  community \nconsultations. \n14.  During project 1 of the investment program implementation, a training program will be \nestablished within the PIU to build capacity in the following areas: (i) government policies and \nprocedures  for  the  acquisition  of  customary  land,  including  how  the  MOA  process  can \ncomplement state acquisition of land (it is also anticipated that CAA will request to have a lands \nofficer seconded to the PIU of the investment program); (ii) ADB policies and procedures for \nland acquisition and compensation; (iii) the application of the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s policies \nand procedures to the requirements of the investment program; and (iv) other technical support \nrelated to, among others, surveys and data collection to prepare document management system \nand LIRs, community consultations, and awareness programs. The training will target people \nfrom CAA and the PIU, provincial and district lands officers in all national airport provinces, \nrelevant staff of the valuer general, and any other organizations involved in land acquisition and \ncompensation activities. A key objective of the training program will be to establish sufficient \ntraining capacity within CAA, the investment program, and the Department of Land and Physical \nPlanning  to  implement  training  sessions  for  provincial  and  district  officials  for  subsequent \ntranches. The PIU will also provide financial support for the fieldwork, for example, the conduct \nof detailed document management system or the preparation of LIRs. \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20091030110613+08'00'", "Subject": "Proposed Multitranche Financing Facility", "Author": "Allan Lee", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 8.1 for Word", "Keywords": "civil aviation development investment, papua new guniea civil aviation, papua new guniea airlines, adb multitranche financing facility, papua new guniea air services, adb project 43141, RRP: PNG 43141", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20091125160155+08'00'", "Title": "Civil Aviation Development Investment Program"}, "author_page": " \nVice-President  C.
