INTRODUCTION \n1.  A series of loan and TA projects are being prepared to support coordinated development \nin the Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei (BTH) region with a focus on sustainable and inclusive growth. \nImmediate support includes four TAs and one sovereign loan in the areas of air pollution, \nbalanced economic and social development, and low carbon transport.1  \n \n2.  This technical assistance (TA) has been developed upon request from the Ministry of \nTransport  (MOT)  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  Through  this  TA,  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) will support MOT to develop and coordinate intercity railway services \nin the BTH region. In June 2015, ADB and MOT reached an understanding on the objectives, \nscope, implementation arrangements, costs, and terms of reference for the TA. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The PRC has a rapidly growing economy, with citizens enjoying higher living standards, \naccompanied by an increasingly fast urbanization process. In March 2014, the State Council \nunveiled  the  National  Plan  on  New  Urbanization,  2014\u20132020,  which  aims  to  promote  the \ncoordinated  development  of  cities  and  small towns  by  agglomerating  conurbations,  or  city \ngroups.3 The three metropolitan areas, Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta, and the \nZhuijiang River Delta, currently account for 18% of the national population and 36% of gross \ndomestic product.4 The urbanization rate is expected to reach 60% in 2020 and 70% in 2030, \nwith an increasing number of city groups and metropolitan areas expected to be the fulcrum of \nregional economic growth. The development of intercity rail services is seen as the critical \nenabler to service the transport demands from continuing urbanization.  \n \n4.  The volume of passenger transportation in the PRC is expected to change rapidly in the \nnext decade. With rising incomes and mobility, there will be a growing need for higher quality \npassenger  travel.  Urbanization  and  agglomeration  of  city  groups,  together  with  greater \nconcentration of economic activity in urban areas, will generate more frequent and greater flows \nof passengers within and between these areas.  Experience in Tokyo, London and Paris shows \nthat intercity railway plays an essential enabling role in the development of city groups and \nmetropolitan areas. The development of supporting policy, and a phased prioritized network \ndevelopment and operations plan, is essential to the establishment of  sustainable intercity \nrailway services. \n \n5.  In recent years, the PRC has focused on the rapid development of intercity railways, \nincluding development of the world\u2019s largest high-speed rail network (services with a maximum \n                                                \n1  The four TAs are: (i) Study on the Coordinated Development of Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei; (ii) Study on Beijing\u2013\nTianjin\u2013Hebei Air Pollution Control; (iii) Policy Study on the Development of Intercity Railway in the Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013\nHebei Region; and (iv) Study on Handan Low Carbon Emission Transport Project. The sovereign loan is the \nBeijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei Air Quality Improvement Policy-Based Lending Project.   \n2  This TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the ADB website on 5 September 2015. \n3  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State \nCouncil. 2014.

Since March 2013, the MOT has comprehensive responsibilities for railway planning and \nis in the process to operationalize its new role. In 2013, the State Council provided new policy \ndirections on railway reform and investment,6 including that local governments should have the \nright to own and operate intercity railways, rural railways, and branch lines.7  \n \n7.  The National Development and Reform Commission of the PRC is working with various \nauthorities and regional governments on a development plan to boost economic integration of \nBeijing  and  its  surrounding  provincial  areas,  Tianjin  municipality,  and  Hebei  province.  To \npromote economic integration, the BTH region, also referred to as the JingJinJi (JJJ) region, are \nstarting to construct an intercity high-speed train network involving major investments. Focusing \non integrated transportation in the area, Beijing is going to play the lead role in driving the \ntransportation connections among the three places.  \n \n8.  A coordinated program for intercity railway development in the BTH region is needed to \npromote sustainable,  clean  transportation,  as the  region  suffers from poor  air quality,  and \ncontribute to its economic development. Hebei is the least developed in the BTH region, with a \ngross domestic product per capita of 42% that of Beijing and 39% that of Tianjin in 2013. About \n88% of the 3.1 million poor people in the BTH region live in Hebei.8  \n \n9.  To implement this provincial railway plan a new company has been established, named \nJingJinJi Intercity Rapid Railway Investment Co., Ltd. It has a capital of CNY10 billion and is \nowned  by  Beijing,  Tianjin,  and  Hebei  (each  30%),  and  China  Railway  Corporation  (10%). \nConstruction of the first two lines is planned to start in 2016. Funding of the total investment \nplan (that identified construction of lines up to 2020 and thereafter) is not yet secured. \n \n10.  As  part  of  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to  boost  the  slowing  economy  and  deepen  its \nfinancing and investment mechanism, the PRC is expected to open its railway sector to private \ninvestment. Private capital will be encouraged to participate in the construction and operation of \nrailways through joint ventures and sole ownership, with a focus on intercity railways.  \n \n11.  The proposed TA is intended to support MOT in its planning responsibility to develop \nand coordinate intercity services in the BTH region, providing expertise in (i) intercity network \nplanning; (ii) multimodal hub and transit-oriented development; (iii) funding options, including \npublic\u2013private partnership  for intercity rail construction and operations; and (iv) institutional \ndevelopment. MOT will involve JJJ Intercity Rapid Railway Investment Co., Ltd.   as a TA \ncounterpart  where  relevant.  The  experience  gained  through  this  TA  will  serve  intercity \ndevelopment elsewhere in the PRC. \n \n                                                \n5  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, State Council. 2013.

THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The  expected  impact  of  the  TA  is  the  development  of  sustainable  intercity  railway \nservices in the BTH region. The expected outcome is a coordinated policy framework to enable  \nintegrated intercity railway services in the BTH region. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The main outputs of the TA are described in paras. 13-16: \n \n14.  Intercity railway network planning for Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei region improved. The \nTA will support MOT and the JJJ Intercity Rapid Railway Investment Co., Ltd. with intercity \nnetwork  planning  and  station  location,  developing  the  strategy,  and  preparing  a  phased, \nprioritized plan for construction and operation. Consultants will provide a strategy document on \nintercity railway development in the BTH region up to 2030 and this strategy document will be \nsubmitted to MOT by October 2016. \n \n15.  Multimodal hub plan for intercity railway stations developed. The TA will support \nplanning for the development of integrated multimodal stations and transit-oriented development \nof station areas. Consultants will submit recommendations on mode integration, multimodal hub \ndesign,  and  transit-oriented  development  in  the  region  will  be  submitted  to  MOT  and  JJJ \nIntercity Rapid Railway Investment Co., Ltd.  by October 2016. \n \n16.  Funding  options  for  intercity  railways  formulated.  The  TA  will  prepare  policy \nproposals for MOT to support the implementation of intercity services, including the funding of \ninfrastructure, intercity operations and stations, and real estate development. Guidelines for, \nand support to, the development to public\u2013private partnerships will also be prepared. Funding \nguidelines on infrastructure construction (including stations and station area development) and \noperations will be submitted to MOT by October 2016. \n \n17.  Regulatory framework for intercity railways developed. The TA will strengthen MOT \nin the development of institutional arrangements for construction, financing, and operation of an \nintercity railway network in the BTH region. Guidelines on institutional arrangements in planning, \nfinancing, and implementing of the intercity network in the BTH region will be submitted by \nconsultants by October 2016. \n \n18.  Possible  risks  include  insufficient  consensus  on  draft  high-level  policy  proposals  to \nsupport  the  intercity  development  plan,  and  insufficient  involvement,  cooperation,  and \nownership by MOT, the executing agency to implement the TA. Continuous policy dialogue with \nthe  executing  agency  and  selection  of  high-quality  international  consultants  with  strong \nexperience in passenger railway planning and related development projects  in the PRC will \nmitigate these risks. Further, workshops may be held on specific topics to exchange knowledge \nand experience with the executing agency.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, suitably furnished office space with \n ", " 4 \nutilities and telecommunication access, information materials, data, maps and other documents, \nand other in-kind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  Since the TA will provide direct support to MOT staff, MOT is the executing agency. The \nTA will be conducted in close cooperation with the JingJinJi Intercity Rapid Railway Investment \nCo., Ltd. The primary place of assignment will be Beijing. MOT will provide office space and \nother help for the consultants at the ministry. \n \n21.  The TA will be implemented over a 16-month period from 1 October 2015 to 31 January \n2017 and will require a total of 9 person-months for three international consultants and 12 \nperson-months  for  four  national  consultants.  ADB  will  engage  individual  consultants  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime). Proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in line with the Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n22.  The international team will comprise (i) team leader and passenger railway planning \nspecialist (5 person-months), (ii) passenger railway operations and multimodal station specialist \n(2 person-months), and (iii) railway sector funding specialist (2 person-months). \n \n23.  The  team  of  national  consultants  will  comprise  (i)  deputy  team  leader  and  railway \nplanning specialist (4 person-months), (ii) railway operations and multimodal station specialist (3 \nperson-months), (iii) railway technology specialist (3 person-months), and (iv) railway financial \nanalyst (2 person-months).  \n \n24.   In addition to the delivery of the main outputs, upon request, consultants will provide \nhands-on support to MOT for planning and coordination issues to respond to actual needs. To \nmonitor progress in the TA activities and review the key deliverables, MOT will establish a TA \nsteering committee chaired by MOT and  including representatives of the National Railway \nBureau, China Railway Corporation, JJJ Intercity Rapid Railway Investment Co., Ltd., provincial \nrailway operators, and ADB. \n \n25.  The international team leader will administer the workshops and possibly other training \nsessions. International resource persons may be engaged to provide specific knowledge and \nrecommendations at workshops or other information sessions. An international study tour to \nlearn about passenger rail systems and multimodal station operations and utilization in large \nconurbations (e.g., Tokyo, or the Kyoto\u2013Osaka\u2013Kobe area in Japan), is included in the budget. \nADB\u2019s  approval  of the tour requires  a  detailed  proposal  describing  destination,  objectives, \nprogram, and budget.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n26.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Policy Study on the Development of \nIntercity Railway in the Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei Region, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the Project is Aligned with \nSustainable intercity railway services in the BTH region developed (MOT circular on railway development \nand coordination)  \n \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and   \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome        \n \nCoordinated policies for  MOT policies on intercity  MOT railway policy  Insufficient consensus \nintegrated intercity  railway development in the  annual report  on draft high-level policy \nrailway services in the  BTH region, including  proposals to support the \nMOT guiding \nBTH region developed  directives on (i) integration of  intercity development \nopinions on railway \n  modes, (ii) financing and  plan \ndevelopment \nfunding, and (iii) BTH intercity \npublished in the   \nnetwork planning and \nannual state \nmultimodal hubs formulated \ncouncil gazette \nby 2017  (baseline = 0) \nOutputs       \n \n1.
