The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic has requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) \ntechnical assistance (TA) to support reform and strengthening of the vocational education and \nskills training (VEST) system. A loan of $10 million for a vocational education project is included in \nthe project pipeline for 2006 to address priority needs. The Fact-Finding Mission visited the Kyrgyz \nRepublic  to  review  priority  needs  and  reached  understanding  on  the  objectives,  scope, \nimplementation  and  financing  arrangements  for  project  preparatory  TA.11The  TA  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The macroeconomic situation in the Kyrgyz Republic has improved over the past 3 years. \nGross domestic product (GDP) grew at 6.7% in 2004. The economy is based on agriculture, which \ncontributes about 37% of the GDP; services around 42%; and industry around 21%.22In 2003, GDP \nper capita was $377. In 2003, the estimated population of the Kyrgyz Republic was 5.1 million, with \na population growth rate of about 1.1%. Of the population, 45% are between 5 and 19 years of \nage.  Poverty  continues  to  be  a  serious  issue,  but  considerable  progress  has  been  made  in \ncombating it. The head count index of absolute poverty declined from 44.4% in 2002 to 40.8% in \n2003 due to a 14% increase in average real wages, improved agriculture production, and price \nstability. \n \n3.  The Country Strategy and Program for the Kyrgyz Republic for 2004\u20132006 supports the \nGovernment\u2019s development priority of reducing poverty by promoting private sector-led economic \ngrowth and supporting human resource development. The VEST system is the key instrument to \naccelerate economic growth by improving the productivity and competitiveness of the workforce \n(Appendix 2). Currently, however, there is a serious mismatch between skills supply and labor \nmarket demand that impedes further economic growth and leads to shortage of skilled labor and \ninefficient  use  of  the  labor  force.  The  economic  consequences  of  these  deficiencies  are \nunemployment, lagging competitiveness, insufficient innovation, and low productivity. \n \n4.  The official unemployment rate in 2004 was reported at around 10.4% of the labor force. \nHowever, the official data provided only a partial picture of the unemployment problem. More \ncomprehensive figures suggest that the unemployment rate is almost 18% of the workforce, or \npossibly even higher. As in other former Soviet economies, a large number of those without work \ndo not bother to register, given the negligible benefits available and the limited usefulness of state \nunemployment services. The number of jobless people could be even higher, given that many who \nare technically considered to be working are actually under-employed.33The unemployed young \npeople account for 53% of all unemployed and remain one of the most problematic issues.44 \n \n5.  The  fact  that  economic  expansion  has  not been  accompanied  by  employment  growth \nsuggests that some of the workforce may be working in the informal economy, not declaring their \nearnings for tax reasons. Surveys suggest that the informal sector contributes up to 40% of the \ngross  national  product  (GNP),  which  is  not  recorded  in  official  statistics.55Employment  in  the \nagriculture sector is disproportionately high. Although agriculture contributes only about one third of \nGDP, the sector engaged around 43% of the employed workforce in 2003.66In order to improve \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 23 February 2005. \n2   Other sectors such as mining and construction contributed the remaining 7%.  \n3  Source of employment information: The Economist Intelligence Unit. 2004.

In addition, a growing number of workers in the agriculture sector are seeking \nretraining opportunities to acquire skills to improve their employability in other sectors. \n \n6.  At present, the Government is the major provider of vocational education for the youth. \nVocational education is offered at two levels and administered by two ministries. Primary vocational \neducation (PVE) at the senior secondary level is administered by the Department for Vocational \nTraining and Education (DVTE) under the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection (MLSP), while \nmidlevel  vocational  education  at  the  postsecondary  level  falls  under  the  responsibility  of  the \nMinistry of Education (MOE). DVTE administers 113 PVE institutions: 27 vocational technical \ncolleges (VTCs) and 86 professional lyceums. The goal of PVE is to train young people to satisfy \nthe demand for skilled labor. The entry qualification for professional lyceums and VTCs is grade 9. \nProfessional lyceums follow the Soviet system and offer 3-year combined general and vocational \neducation in 125 skills areas. Programs are largely supply driven, hence graduates do not find jobs \neasily due to lack of employable skills. DVTE employs around 3,400 teachers; about 50% are \nvocational teachers. In 2004 25,972 students including 9,258 female students enrolled in PVE. \nMany PVE students come from poor families, who cannot afford higher education.  \n \n7.  MOE is responsible for midlevel vocational education and administers 74 technicums77with \n3,019 faculty members. Technicums require an entry qualification of grade 11 and offer diploma \nand bachelor courses. In 2003 around 27,000 students were enrolled in technicums; 64% were \nfemale. No tracer studies are available, but anecdotal evidence suggests that a large number of \ngraduates have difficulty finding employment after course completion. \n \n8.  DVTE also provides a limited number of short-term skills training courses to retrain adults. \nHowever, interaction with industry in designing retraining programs is weak, and programs are not \nresponsive to labor market demands. Other line ministries (e.g. Ministry of Agriculture [MOA]) and \nprivate training providers offer retraining programs for adults often with the support of development \npartners.  However,  these  programs  are  limited  to  particular  regions  and  subsectors.  For  the \nnumerous youths who have left school without marketable skills, and unemployed workers and \nadults who seek new jobs outside agriculture, adequate skills training and retraining are necessary \nto  be  more  competitive  and  take  advantage  of  income-earning  opportunities  to  move  out  of \npoverty. However, the current VEST system is confronted with several issues in meeting this \nrequirement. \n \n9.  Cooperation among MOE, MLSP, and other public and private training providers is weak. \nNo comprehensive national policy on VEST and national human resource development plan linked \nto present and future labor market needs are in place. The current VEST system performs poorly in \nproviding access to demand-driven short-term skills training for adults. Most adults, particularly the \npoor and disadvantaged, lack access to skills training and retraining opportunities. Strategies to \nmobilize and strengthen private training providers to complement VEST programs under DVTE and \nMOE in addressing training and retraining needs of adults are not available. Although vocational \neducation is indicated as a development priority of the Government, the current budget allocation \nfor PVE is inadequate to ensure efficient and effective delivery of VEST. \n \n10.  PVE for the youth is largely supply-driven. Training programs are based mostly on allocated \nbudgets  and  available  staff  and  equipment  and  are  not  significantly  refocused  to  reflect  the \nemerging needs of the labor market. The current labor market information system is unable to \nprovide up-to-date labor market data to guide the design and revision of training programs. The \nlack of information and resource sharing between industry and training providers creates a gap \nbetween supply and demand and lowers the quality and relevance of training programs. Training \n                                                 \n7  A technicum is a training institution under MOE offering postsecondary vocational training.  \n ", "  3\ninstitutions are often not fully aware of the needs of industry, nor are they able to explore ways to \ninvolve industry participation effectively. No systematic monitoring system to ensure the quality of \ntraining programs is in place. \n \n11.  The curriculum for PVE is developed by the Research and Methodology Center (RMC) \nunder DVTE. RMC has developed 150 curriculum modules for PVE and 100 training courses for \nadult retraining programs. Industry involvement in curriculum development is limited and current \ncurricula are not regularly revised to reflect changing technology and market demand. Cooperation \nbetween  RMC  and  curriculum  development  divisions  in  MOE  is  limited.  No  comprehensive \ncurriculum  development  strategy  with  active  industry  involvement  focusing  on  modular  and \ncompetency-based training is in place. \n \n12.  Teaching techniques and technical skills and knowledge of many teachers are outdated \nand need to be upgraded. Teachers have no benchmarks to measure their own technical and \ninstructional capability, and thus have no means of determining the gap between their current \nperformance  and  their  desired  capability.  Textbooks  used  in  PVE  institutions  are  seriously \noutdated. More than 90% of around 1,100 titles currently in use were developed before 1980; less \nthan 5% of the current textbooks have been revised after 1990. The lack of appropriate equipment, \nadequate  teaching  aids,  and  learning  materials  is  a  constraint  on  applying  modern  teaching \nmethodologies. The quality of hands-on skills training is seriously hampered by poor and outdated \ntraining equipment, and lack of tools and consumables. \n \n13.  Currently there is no comprehensive recognized national system for skills standards. The \nquality of skills training depends on the quality of instruction, which is often adversely affected by \nthe lack of training materials and equipment, poor teaching environment, and outdated knowledge \nof teachers. VTCs and professional lyceums set their own examinations, without formal external \nquality control or moderation and with only occasional involvement of the private sector.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The proposed TA will help prepare a project that will improve access to demand-driven \nVEST for youths and adults and ensure its quality, relevance, and efficiency. The project proposal \nwill address key issues in VEST and will include (i) draft recommendations for a comprehensive \nnational policy framework and sustainable financing mechanisms conducive to the provision of \ndemand-driven VEST for youths and adults; (ii) draft strategies and investment needs to rationalize \nand strengthen the current PVE system for the youth, including building of the capacity of PVE \ninstitutions  and  rehabilitating  and  upgrading  selected  training  facilities;  (iii)  draft  strategies  to \nincrease the availability of skills training and retraining opportunities for adults by mobilizing public \nand private training providers; and (iv) draft strategies to promote a public-private partnership \nstrengthening linkages between VEST providers and industries, including establishing a labor \nmarket information system to guide VEST programs in adjusting to changing labor market needs. A \nsummary initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The TA will be conducted through a collaborative and participatory process ensuring a high \nlevel  of  consultation  with  all  major  government  and  nongovernment  stakeholders,  and  the \ndevelopment partners. Participatory workshops at national and provincial levels will be held to \ndiscuss issues and potentials of public and private VEST provision and financing to ensure close \ncooperation  and  active  involvement  of  government  stakeholders,  private  and  public  training \nproviders, industry representatives and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) in the design of the \n ", "4   \nproposed project. The TA will undertake a social and poverty impact analysis and recommend \nstrategies to improve access to VEST for disadvantaged groups.  \n \n16.  Establishment of a National Policy Framework for VEST. For  the first output the TA will \ndraft recommendations to establish a comprehensive national policy framework that will promote \ndemand-driven  VEST  for  youths  and  adults  and  will  clarify  the  Government\u2019s  future  role  in \nproviding VEST. The component will include the following activities: (i) review current policies, \nstrategies, and regulatory acts relevant to VEST; (ii) assess the labor market and socioeconomic \nframework  conditions,  and  identify  dynamic  subsectors  and  skills  requirements;  (iii)  assess \ncapacities of and institutional arrangements between MLSP, MOE, and other relevant government \nagencies including DVTE; (iv) clarify the roles and responsibilities of all government levels in  \nproviding VEST and give recommendations for reform of the VEST system; and (v) assess the \ncurrent VEST financing and future budget requirements. \n \n17.  Rationalization and Building the Capacity of PVE. The TA will review rationalization and \ncapacity building needs to improve the quality, relevance, and efficiency of PVE for the youth. \nConsidering the institutional capacity assessments and proposed reform strategies, investment \nneeds  will  be  identified  to  enhance  technical,  pedagogical,  and  managerial  capacities  and \ncompetencies of professional lyceums and VTCs, including upgrading and rehabilitating selected \ntraining facilities to improve the teaching and learning environment. Activities will include: (i) a \ndetailed review of the current PVE system, considering its relevance to social and economic \nobjectives, market demands, effectiveness in meeting training objectives, and efficiency in the use \nof resources; (ii) a review of the current curriculum and strategies to improve curriculum quality and \nrelevance; (iii) a review of teaching methods, and learning and teaching materials, and assessment \nof training needs of teachers and managers; (iv) preparation of a prioritized investment plan for \nrehabilitating  and  upgrading  selected  PVE  facilities,  including  detailed  cost  estimates  for \nrehabilitation and upgrading; (v) strategies to strengthen linkages between PVE and midlevel \nvocational education to generate synergies; and (vi) assessment of the financial viability and \nsustainability of the proposed investment plan. \n \n18.  Public  and  Private  Provision  of  Skills  Training  for  Adults.  The  TA  will  develop \nstrategies to increase the availability of skills training and retraining opportunities for adults by \nmobilizing public and private training providers. Following institutional capacity assessments of \npublic training providers and labor market analysis, strategies will be developed to strengthen the \ncapacities of private training providers to complement MLSP in enhancing skills training programs \nfor  adults.  In  addition,  strategies  will  be  developed  to  further  utilize  the  capacities  of  VTCs, \nprofessional lyceums, and technicums to provide short-term skills training for adults during lean \nperiods. Financing requirements for establishing a nationwide demand-driven skills training system \nfor adults will be reviewed, taking into account the limited resources of unemployed and poor \nadults.  \n \n19.  Promotion  of  Demand-Driven  VEST.  The  TA  will  review  the  need  for  strengthening \nlinkages between industries, public and private training providers, and government agencies to \nestablish joint mechanisms promoting design, conduct, and finance of demand-driven VEST. This \noutput will include strategies to set up a labor market information system disseminating labor \nmarket trends to assist training providers to adjust training programs promptly to meet needs. \nMajor outcomes will include: (i) analysis of the current interaction between skills provision and \nindustry; (ii) strategies to establish coordination mechanisms among government agencies, training \nproviders, industries, trade unions, chambers of commerce, and other relevant organizations to \npromote  skills  development;  (iii)  recommendations  to  stimulate  enterprise-based  training, \napprentices and attachment schemes; and (iv) assessment of current labor market information \nsystems and their relevance to guide the design and revision of training programs. \n \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The TA cost is estimated at $355,000 equivalent, of which $242,000 is in foreign exchange \nand $113,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government requested ADB to finance $300,000 \nequivalent, which includes the entire foreign exchange cost and $58,000 equivalent of the local \ncurrency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by \nthe Government of Japan. The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic will finance the remaining local \ncurrency cost of $55,000 equivalent in kind for office accommodation, counterpart staff, transport, \nand facilities for seminars and workshops. The Government has been advised that approval of the \nTA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. The cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  Given that the responsibility for VEST is currently divided between MLSP and MOE and \nthat  reviewing  institutional  arrangements  for  VEST  is  a  priority  for  the  TA,  the  Office  of  the \nPresident (OP) of the Kyrgyz Republic will be the Executing Agency for the TA. Based on the \nsector review and related institutional assessments, implementation arrangements for the ensuing \nproject, including identifying a suitable executing agency, will be decided. The OP will provide \nsuitable, furnished office space and counterpart support, including a qualified TA coordinator to \noversee  TA  implementation.  An  international  consulting  firm  will  provide  consulting  services \n(person-months  in  parentheses)  from  international  consultants  \u2013  (i)  VEST  and  organizational \ndevelopment specialist/ team leader (4.5); (ii) labor market analyst and education economist (3.0); \n(iii) specialist for training, curriculum and textbook development (2.0); (iv) education facilities, \nequipment and financial specialist (2.0); (v) management information system specialist (1.5); and \ndomestic  consultants  \u2013  (i)  education  policy  analyst  (4.0);  (ii)  labor  market  analyst  (3.0);  (iii) \npoverty/social development specialist (2.0); (iv) curriculum, textbook and training material specialist \n(2.0); (v) financial analyst/financial management specialist (3.0); and (vi) education facilities and \nequipment specialist (3.0). The team leader will submit an inception report 4 weeks after the \nassignment starts, a draft final report 2 weeks before and a final report 2 weeks after the planning \nworkshop.  \n \n22.  A steering committee, chaired by the OP and including representatives from MLSP, MOE, \nMOF, MOA, trade unions, and two industry representatives, will be established to provide policy \nguidance and technical advice in the process of assessing the current system and drafting policy \nrecommendations. The TA will be implemented over 6 months commencing in January 2006. The \nproject design will be developed in a continuous consultation process with major government and \nnongovernment  stakeholders  and  development  partners.  ADB  will  engage  the  consultants  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. An international consulting firm will \nbe selected based on the quality- and cost-based selection method, using the simplified technical \nproposal. Outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4. TA-financed equipment \nand materials will be procured by the consulting firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement and will remain with OP after completion of the TA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n23.  The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment of the Kyrgyz Republic for preparing the Vocational Education and Skills Training \nProject, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/   Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact      Assumption \nAccess to and quality and  \u2022  Measure social, economic, and  \u2022  Educational  \u2022  Government \nrelevance of demand-driven  poverty indicators       statistics,   remains committed \nvocational education skills and    \u2022  Tracer studies  to the education \ntraining (VEST) for youth and  (Baselines for monitoring will be  \u2022  Labor market  sector as a priority \nadults are improved   determined during the PPTA)  statistics   in national \n    development. \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nDesign for a loan project is  \u2022  Memorandum of understanding  \u2022  Memorandum of  \u2022  Government and \nprepared and agreed upon by  signed by Government and  understanding  ADB sign loan \nthe Government and ADB  ADB during appraisal mission,  agreement. \n  third quarter 2006   \n    \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
