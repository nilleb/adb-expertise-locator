INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of Turkmenistan has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) for Financial Sector Reforms. This is in \nline  with  the  government\u2019s  priorities  for  improving  Turkmenistan\u2019s  financial  system  and  its \nmeasures to develop the banking, microfinance, and nonbank financial subsectors as outlined in \nTurkmenistan\u2019s  National  Program  of  Socio-Economic  Development  of Turkmenistan,  2011\u2013\n2030.  The  TA  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan,  2014\u20132015  for \nTurkmenistan.1 The scope of the TA was discussed during a consultation mission from 28 \nFebruary to 1 March 2013. During a due diligence mission from 13 to 20 November 2013, ADB \nand the government reached an understanding on TA impact, outcome, outputs, cost estimates, \nfinancing plan, implementation arrangements, and outline terms of reference for consultants. \nConcurrence was obtained through the confirmation by the Central Bank of Turkmenistan (CBT) \nof  aide  memoires  dated  13  July  2013  and  6  January  2014.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Turkmenistan\u2019s economy grew by 10.2% in 2013, and gross domestic product (GDP) per \ncapita has more than tripled since 2003 to reach the level of upper middle-income economies. \nEconomic  growth  has  been  based  on  hydrocarbon  exports  and  public  spending  on \ninfrastructure.3 Oil and gas production and exports are expected to increase in 2014, providing \ncontinued funding for the public sector and subsidies for basic goods and services. GDP is \nforecast to grow by 10.7% in 2014 and 12.5% in 2015 with increased public investment and gas \nexports to the People\u2019s Republic of China. Inflation is projected at 5.7% in 2014 and 6.0% in \n2015. \n \n3.  The financial system comprises 12 banks (of which 6 are state-owned and target specific \nsectors such as agriculture and construction), a nascent securities market, and two insurance \ncompanies. 4  The  State  Development  Bank  of  Turkmenistan  has  been  operating  since \nSeptember 2011. Banks collaborating with financial services companies, including Western \nUnion, provide remittance services. Banks dominate the financial system in volume and value of \nactivity. While most bank lending is to state-owned enterprises, credit to the private sector is \ngrowing. Government-sponsored programs encourage the growth of small and medium-sized \nenterprises and agriculture. \n \n4.  Building and strengthening financial infrastructure and increasing access to finance are \nhigh  on  Turkmenistan\u2019s  development  agenda.  The  CBT  is  creating  better  financial  market \ninfrastructure  for  more  active  private  sector  engagement  in  the  economy.  New  banking \nlegislation, regulation, and supervision will improve investments and help broaden growth and \nfinancial access. The gradual shift from directed lending to risk-based lending is an important \nstep towards this. All banks are adopting International Financial Reporting Standards. The \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) noted progress in these areas as well as on the Anti-Money-\n                                                \n1  ADB. 2013. Country Operations Business Plan: Turkmenistan, 2014-2015. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 17 February 2014. \n3  Turkmenistan is an upper middle-income country with a young population of about 5.3 million and GDP of about \n$41.85 billion (2013). It borders Afghanistan, Iran, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan, as well as the Caspian Sea. The \ncountry is home to the world\u2019s driest desert, the Karakum Desert, which covers 80.0% of the land area. \nTurkmenistan has significant oil and the world\u2019s fourth-largest natural gas reserves, and is the world\u2019s ninth-largest \nexporter of cotton. Turkmenistan has been an ADB member since 2000. \n4  The two insurance companies are: (i) the state-owned Turkmengosstrah and (ii) the Insurance Services joint stock \ncompany in which state-owned enterprises hold a 50.0% equity stake. \n ", "2   \nLaundering/Combating  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  arrangements. 5  The  IMF  provided \nsuggestions  on  reducing  bank  sector  segmentation  and  interest  rate  controls,  as  well  as \nimproving statistical standards and data availability. \n \n5.  The  government  recognizes  the  need  to  support  private  sector  development  and \neconomic  diversification. While  large  hydrocarbon  exports  have  produced  strong  economic \ngrowth over the past decade, it has also stifled economic diversification. The government aims \nto increase the private sector\u2019s share in the non-hydrocarbon economy from 47.0% in 2010 to \n70.0%  by  2020.6 It  targets  private  sector  development  in  construction,  transportation,  and \nwholesale and retail trade, as well as agro-industrial processing. Development and financing of \nnon-hydrocarbon value chains is a challenge. An expanded, accessible, and efficient finance \nsector is necessary to facilitate diversified private sector development. The government expects \nto modernize banking and the financial system to increase their contribution to overall economic \nrestructuring. In particular, the government wants financial institutions to provide an array of \nfinancial services and products to small and medium-sized enterprises. \n \n6.  The CBT is committed to improving the legal environment for the finance sector and has \nannounced a variety of laws to be created and submitted to Parliament. Deposit insurance is in \nplace, but the legal and regulatory framework needs strengthening. The authorities aim to \ndevelop regulations to implement the recent microfinance and credit union laws, and to create \nnew institutions for microfinance.7  \n \n7.  A wide range of legislation will be  created by 2017 for which development partner \nassistance is needed. The government takes about 1 year from the initial plan to the passage of \nlaws. Three major laws have been completed and enacted in 2011 covering the central bank, \ncredit institutions and banking activity, and foreign exchange regulation and control.8 Current \npriorities  include  developing  laws  on  e-signatures  and  deposit  insurance,  as  well  as \nimplementing  rules  and  regulations  for  e-signatures,  deposit  insurance,  and  microfinance. \nJointly with other interested public agencies, the CBT will draft laws consistent with international \nbest  practice.  The  authorities  seek  ADB  support  in  the  form  of  high-quality  international \nconsultants  to  provide  capacity  building  and  policy  and  advisory  support  on  best  practice \ncontext and examples. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n8.  The TA will support the CBT  in developing modern, best practice legislation on  e- \nsignatures  and  deposit  insurance,  as  well  as  implementing  rules  and  regulations  for  e-\nsignatures, deposit insurance, and microfinance.    \n                                                \n5  IMF. 2011.

Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact will be an improved legal framework for delivery of financial services in \nTurkmenistan. The outcome will be the commencement of the legislative process for draft laws \non deposit insurance and e-signatures. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA will deliver two outputs: \n \n(i)  Capacity of Central Bank of Turkmenistan staff in deposit insurance, e-\nsignatures, and microfinance strengthened. The TA will finance training of \nCBT  staff  in  international  best  practice  and  principles  for  deposit  insurance \n(including the principles of the International Association of Deposit Insurers), e-\nsignatures, microfinance, rules and procedures for quality legal drafting, and \nquality assurance checks. International consultants will provide best practice and \nexamples, and counterpart drafting teams will consist of national experts. \n \n(ii)  New laws (deposit insurance and e-signatures) and implementing rules and \nregulations (deposit insurance, e-signatures, and microfinance) finalized. \nThe TA will (a) review existing legal frameworks, and assess and recommend \napplicability of international best practice and principles on deposit insurance and \ne-signatures;  (b)  conduct  consultations  on  incorporating  international  best \npractice and principles into deposit insurance and e-signatures with the CBT and \nother national stakeholders; (c) support the CBT team in preparing draft laws for \ndeposit  insurance  and  e-signatures;  (d)  support  the  CBT  team  in  preparing \nimplementing rules and regulations for deposit insurance, e-signatures, and the \nLaw  on  Microfinance  Institutions  and  Microfinance;  (e)  conduct  validation \nworkshops  to  present  draft  laws  and  implementing  rules  and  regulations  to \nrelevant stakeholders; (f) conduct quality assurance checks; and (g) finalize draft \nlaws  and  implementing  rules  and  regulations.  Discussion  of  regulations  and \nimplementation of laws, along with related legislation and how it may need to be \naligned with changing local conditions, will be important. International consultants \nwill work with national counterparts from the CBT and other agencies CBT may \ndesignate.  The  partner  process  will  involve  information  sharing,  legislation \ndrafting, on-the-job training, and formal training sessions by consultants. CBT \nand  government  lawyers  will,  in  cooperation  with  consultants,  manage  the \nstructure and format of the legislation, and align existing and planned laws with \nimplementing rules and regulations. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $600,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  staff  and  their  travel  and  per  diem,  office \naccommodation and training venues and arrangements, logistical support, interpretation and \ntranslation services, facilitation of consultants\u2019 timely access to information and stakeholders, \nand other in-kind contributions. \n \n \n \n ", "4   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  The TA will be implemented from November 2014 to September 2016, with the CBT as \nthe executing agency. ADB\u2019s Public Management, Financial Sector and Trade Division, Central \nand West Asia Department (CWPF) will be responsible for implementing the TA. CWPF will \nwork closely with consultants and the CBT to monitor implementation progress and evaluate \nachievements using the design and monitoring framework. To ensure complementarities where \nfeasible,  CWPF  will  work  on  relevant  issues  with  the  Private  Sector  Financial  Institutions \nDivision  of  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  and  with  ADB\u2019s  newly  created \nEconomic Research and Regional Cooperation Department. \n \n13.  The TA will cover remuneration, travel, and per diem of consultants, as well as training, \nworkshops,  and  miscellaneous  expenses.  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  done  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \n14.  The TA will require 12.0 person-months of international consultants, comprising 4.5 \nperson-months for a deposit insurance legal expert, 3.0 person-months for an e-signatures legal \nexpert, and 4.5 person-months for a microfinance legal expert. The consultants will work about \n80.0% in country (two trips for each consultant) and about 20.0% in their home offices on \npreparation and report writing. The government has requested all consultants be international, \nhigh-level experts who can work directly with CBT staff to build their capacity and provide formal \ntraining to select groups. Three individual consultants will be recruited through ADB\u2019s consultant \nmanagement system in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended  from  time  to  time).  Individual  recruitment  is  justified  by  (i)  the  small  number  of \nconsultants involved with different and narrow expertise, and (ii) individual experience and \nqualifications in particular areas being the main requirements. The outline terms of reference for \nconsultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n15.  The  consultants  will  report  to  ADB\u2019s  project  officer  and  consult  with  a  senior-level \ncoordinator to be identified by the CBT during all periods in country. Each consultant will submit \nan inception report, incorporating a brief training needs assessment of his or her counterparts, \nto ADB and the CBT within 2 weeks after the contract starts. Summary progress reports, \nincluding training results, are due within 1 week after the end of each in-country trip. The \nconsultants  will  also  deliver  submissions  on  draft  legal  materials  in  partnership  with  their \ncounterparts, and a final report within 1 week after the end of the contract. \n \n16.  The  TA  will  follow  standard  monitoring  and  supervision  procedures  for  ADB-\nadministered TA. Good practice and lessons will be disseminated through policy dialogue with \nthe government, as well as in seminar and training materials and knowledge products published \nunder the TA. An evaluation of performance and outcomes will be conducted at the end of the \nTA and documented in a TA completion report. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Turkmenistan for Financial Sector Reforms, and hereby reports this action to \nthe Board. \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance Targets  Data Sources and   \n  and Indicators with  Reporting   \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Risks \nImproved legal  By December 2018, laws  Official gazette  Laws in enacted versions \nframework for delivery  passed for deposit    deviate from draft laws \nof financial services in  insurance and e-   endorsed by CBT \nTurkmenistan  signatures    management \n     \nTMM-denominated private  CBT monthly  Weak implementation of laws \ncredit increased to 6.0%  bulletin  constrains broadening and \nof GDP by the end of    deepening of financial \n2018 (2012 baseline:    services \n4.0% of GDP)   \n   \nTMM-denominated private  CBT monthly \nsavings increased to 2.5%  bulletin \nof GDP by the end of \n2018 (2012 baseline: \n1.0% of GDP) \nOutcome      Assumption \nLegislative process  By December 2016,  Formal  Staff are retained, ensuring \ncommenced for draft  submission of draft laws to  communication  knowledge transfer of trained \nlaws on deposit  Parliament endorsed by  from CBT to ADB  staff in the areas of deposit \ninsurance and e- CBT  on start of the  insurance, e-signatures, and \nsignatures  legislative process  microfinance laws and \nimplementing rules and \nregulations \nOutputs       \n1.
