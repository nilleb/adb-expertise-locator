INTRODUCTION \n1.  The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) regional strategy and \nregional program for food security was drawn up in 2007\u20132008 with the assistance of the Food \nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).1 This was adopted by the Fifteenth \nSAARC Summit in Colombo, Sri Lanka in August 2008. Under SAARC initiatives for regional \nfood  security,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  prepared  seven  food  security  project \nproposals  for  SAARC,  assisted  by  technical  assistance  (TA)  on  Promoting  South  Asian \nRegional Economic Cooperation II.2 SAARC requested ADB assistance in 2012 for a regional \nTA for implementing one of the seven project proposals, namely, the control of transboundary \nanimal diseases (TADs).3 Following SAARC\u2019s request, a fact-finding mission visited Nepal from \n21 to 26 July 2013 and agreed with SAARC on the TA impact, outcome, output, implementation \narrangements, cost estimates, and terms of reference of the consulting services. The TA will \nfocus on promoting sustainable regional cooperation among the SAARC member countries to \naddress common issues related to TADs. The underpinning thrust is on improving biosecurity in \nthe SAARC region; improving food security and safety in the SAARC region; and expanding \nlocal, regional, and international trade in livestock and livestock products. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4  \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Despite  recent  rapid  economic  growth,  about  571  million  people  or  36%  of  the \npopulation are poor in SAARC countries, making up 44% of the developing world\u2019s poor. 5 \nLivestock accounts for 30% of the regional agricultural gross domestic product, and more than \n60% of livestock are owned by smallholder farmers. The majority of rural poor in the region are \ndependent on livestock, which is an important source of protein, micronutrients, income, and \noften the only insurance against crop failure and major medical expenses. By 2020, the demand \nfor livestock products within the region is projected to grow rapidly, requiring the region to \nprovide an estimated additional 4 million tons of meat and 65 million tons of milk.6  \n \n3.  This sharp increase in demand for livestock products, largely driven by high income \ngrowth and rapid urbanization, will potentially improve the livelihoods of smallholder farmers by \ncommercializing  livestock  products.  Meeting  the  growing  livestock  demand  is  a  challenge \nbecause of the impending threats from TADs. Smallholders will have to produce healthy and \nproductive animals to exploit these market opportunities. The outbreak of TADs in the region \nduring 2007\u20132012 killed a large number of animals, threatening the livelihoods of poor people. \nThe morbidity and mortality rates of livestock resulting from TADs are high, and the impact of \nthese diseases on the incomes of poor households is not only felt locally and nationally but also \nwithin and outside the region.     \n \n4.  TADs have threatened food security in the region through reducing the quantity and \nquality of food, serious loss of animal protein, and loss of draught animal power for cropping. \n                                                \n1 The SAARC member countries are Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and \nSri Lanka.  \n2  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance for Promoting South Asian Regional Economic Cooperation II. Manila. \n3   TADs are epidemic diseases that are highly contagious or transmissible and have the potential for very rapid \nspread, irrespective of national borders, causing serious socioeconomic and possibly public health consequences.  \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 31 July 2013.  \n5  On the basis of the percentage of people living on less than $1.25 a day.   \n6  ADB. 2008. Institutionalization of SAARC Mechanisms for the Control of Transboundary Animal Diseases. \nBackground paper prepared under Promoting South Asian Regional Economic Cooperation II. \n \n ", "2   \nMost of the agriculture production in the region is derived from a predominantly mixed crop\u2013\nlivestock farming system based on less than a hectare of land. All countries in the region are \nmainly dependent on the supply of animal protein from milk and meat, mainly derived from \nbuffalo, cattle, sheep, goats, and poultry. Livestock contributes to food security and provides \nhigh-quality  protein  and  micronutrients  to  help  correct  nutritional  deficiencies  caused  by  a \npredominantly vegetarian and cereal-based diet.  \n \n5.  Significant trade, including huge informal trade in livestock and livestock products, is one \nof the major reasons for the spread of high impact TADs between the land-linked South Asia \nnations. These diseases cause devastating economic losses to farmers and the agriculture \nsector.  TADs\u2014such  as  highly  pathogenic  avian  influenza  (HPAI),  foot  and  mouth  disease \n(FMD), and pest des petits ruminants or goat plague (PPR)\u2014are seriously impeding trade and \nmarket opportunities in livestock and livestock products in South Asia. TAD outbreaks cause \nhuge morbidity and mortality in cattle, sheep, goats, and poultry, with significant disruption of \ntrade in livestock, meat, and dairy products. These diseases seriously affect the livelihoods of \nsmallholder livestock farmers, who represent 60% of the population in the region. In Bangladesh, \nthe poultry industry is estimated to have lost $550 million since 2007 as a result of HPAI \noutbreaks.  Losses  of  livestock  in  India  attributable  to  FMD  are  estimated  at  $4.50  billion \nannually. The colossal losses resulting from TADs indicate inadequate capacity of public and \nprivate sector animal health management agencies at country and regional levels.   \n \n6.  The relationship between animal infectious diseases and emerging human diseases is \nwell established. In Asia, two significant zoonotic diseases have emerged in the past decade to \ncause serious epidemics in humans, i.e., Nipah virus disease and severe acute respiratory \nsyndrome. HPAI and/or H5N1 have emerged as a major problem and persists in South Asian \ncountries with varying incidence of outbreaks at national levels. From a global perspective, the \ncontinued presence of uncontrolled foci of HPAI in South Asia is a continued threat for the \nemergence of a pandemic strain of human influenza, as well as a source for introduction of the \nH5N1 virus to other countries, and a threat to livelihoods and food security for the poor in the \nregion.  Highly pathogenic and emerging diseases (HPEDs) are expected to increase, creating \na constant threat in many parts of Asia.    \n \n7.  SAARC countries face significant challenges in the implementation of animal health \nmanagement strategies, especially in surveillance, reporting, zoning, contingency planning, and \nrisk  analysis.  This  is  mainly  because  of  inadequate  regional  and  national  capacity  and \nawareness. Improvement in these areas would contribute to improved biosecurity within the \nfood-based industries of SAARC countries\u2014augmenting productivity and market access. Given \nthe transboundary nature of the diseases, a strong coordination mechanism is needed to foster \nand  mobilize  subregional  cooperation  in  controlling  TADs.  Such  mechanisms  have  been \nestablished in other subregions, such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), \nand are highly effective in dealing with TADs. The world is now free from rinderpest, largely \nbecause  of  the  Global  Rinderpest  Eradication  Programme.  Global  experience  shows  that \ncombating TADs requires regional initiatives rather than independent actions by each country. \nNo single country will be able to control these high-impact transboundary diseases effectively \nthrough isolated efforts. SAARC countries, via a series of consultations, agreed to tackle the \nTADs through a regional coordination mechanism under the umbrella of the Global Framework \nfor  the  Progressive  Control  of  Transboundary  Animal  Diseases.  This  joint  FAO\u2013World \n ", "  3 \nOrganization  for  Animal  Health  (OIE)  initiative  on  global  control  of  TADs  is  conducted  in \ncooperation with the World Health Organization (WHO).7  \n \n8.  SAARC undertook regional initiatives in 2010 through the regional cooperation program \non HPEDs funded by the European Union (EU). FAO has been supporting SAARC to implement \nregional cooperation program on HPEDs. Under this project, a regional support unit (RSU) and \na regional epidemiology center have been established in Kathmandu, Nepal. Leading regional \ndiagnostic laboratories (RDLs) have been strengthened in Bangladesh (for PPR), India (for \nFMD), and Pakistan (for HPAI). The institutional structure developed under the EU funding \nneeds to be strengthened and sustained with TA for the next 2 years before SAARC takes it \nover formally. Despite developing an institutional structure, SAARC\u2019s TAD control activities are \nnot fully functional because of limited technical capacity and organizational weaknesses. The \nregional framework for combating TADs is weak, and regional strategies and guidelines are not \nfully harmonized. The RSU and RDLs need to be strengthened with specialist support and \ntechnical expertise to combat TADs effectively. Regional and national animal health information \nand surveillance need to be upgraded. Animal management agencies in the public and private \nsector need to be better equipped to provide specialist assistance in controlling TADs. SAARC\u2019s \nTAD initiatives still lag behind well-established regional TAD activities such as ASEAN program, \nwhich has achieved significant progress in combating TADs\u2014particularly on HPAI, FMD, and \nclassical swine fever. In ASEAN, national animal health capability has been expanded, with \ngreater regional coordination on TADs, focusing on controlling the diseases at source with \nmultisectoral cooperation; and expanding partnership arrangements and cooperation.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome  \n9.  The impact of the TA will be improved control of the priority TADs in affected zones of \nSAARC countries. The impact indicators are (i) the morbidity rate for livestock decreased from \n50% in 2012 to 30% by 2018 in affected zones; and (ii) the mortality rate of livestock decreased \nfrom 70% in 2012 to 35% by 2018 in affected zones. The outcome of the TA will be improved \ncompliance with international sanitary and phytosanitary standards in the SAARC region. The \noutcome  indicator  is  compliance  with  international  sanitary  and  phytosanitary  standards \nimproved from 30% in 2012 to 50% by 2016 in affected zones.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA aims at fostering regional cooperation among SAARC countries, improving food \nsecurity in the region, and facilitating regional and international trade in livestock and livestock \nproducts. It will focus on innovative and new knowledge and/or approaches under the umbrella \nof the Global Framework for the Progressive Control of Transboundary Animal Diseases (para. \n7).  About 30 seminars, workshops and training programs will be organized to improve the \ncapacity of the animal health management agencies and stakeholders to control TADs. \n  \n11.  The TA will build on existing activities within the SAARC region funded through the EU \nregional cooperation program on HPEDs. It will integrate these activities to underpin three \npriority diseases that limit trade in livestock and its products: FMD, PPR, and HPAI. Since many \nTADs can also cause severe disease and death in humans, SAARC through the RSU will use \n                                                \n7  World Organization for Animal Health. The Global Framework for the Progressive Control of Transboundary Animal \nDiseases. http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/About_us/docs/pdf/GF-TADs_approved_version24May2004.pdf. \n ", "4   \nthe One Health approach to ensure a multidisciplinary approach to address these high-impact \ndiseases, involving both the animal and human health sectors.8 The TA will support four outputs \nas follows: \n \n(i)  Output 1: Established framework for improved regional cooperation among \nSouth Asian Association for Regional Cooperation countries in combating \ntransboundary animal diseases. The TA will support the establishment of a \nframework for a sustainable and improved regional cooperation mechanism on \nanimal  health  management  for  SAARC.  It  will  also  focus  on  harmonizing \nstrategies and guidelines on animal health management and disease control \namong SAARC countries. To ensure the long-term sustainability of TAD control \ninitiatives,  SAARC  is  expected  to  endorse  the  framework  and  harmonized \nstrategies and guidelines by the end of the TA.  \n \n(ii)  Output 2: Regional structures in the fight against transboundary animal \ndiseases operational. The TA will support the RSU with specialist assistance to \nmake it fully operational, improving capacity in combating TADs. RDLs will be \nstrengthened with specialist support and technical expertise. By 2016, over 30% \nof the RSU will be supported by the member states, and two out of the three \ndesignated leading laboratories in the region will be self-funded. With SAARC\u2019s \nincreasing  ownership  of  the  regional  mechanism,  the  member  countries  are \nexpected to contribute financially to the regional coordination mechanism by mid-\n2016.  The  TA  will  also  focus  on  improving  disease  control,  based  on  local \nproblem analysis in each country.   \n \n(iii)  Output 3: Expanded regional and national animal health information and \nsurveillance  system.  The  TA  will  support  the  establishment  of  a  regional \nepidemiology center animal health information system, issuing regular reports on \nregional and national animal health information, publishing a bimonthly bulletin, \n(occurring every 2 months) and updating the web-based reporting system. It will \nalso  focus  on  mapping  regional  and  national  animal  movements;  preparing \noptimal  TAD  control  options  for  poor  smallholder  farmers;  and  developing \nregional and national reporting systems, and a surveillance plan. \n \n(iv)  Output  4:  Improved  institutional  capacity  of  public  and  private  sector \nanimal health management agencies. The TA will develop improved animal \nhealth  delivery  mechanisms;  improve  stakeholders\u2019  capacity  in  policy \ndevelopment  in  international  animal  health  procedures  and  regulations;  and \nexpand  technical  expertise  in  epidemiology,  disease  diagnosis,  surveillance, \nreporting, outbreak investigation, and laboratory operations.  \n     \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) and administered by ADB .  \n \n                                                \n8 One health approach recognizes that the health of humans, animals, and ecosystems are interconnected.  \n ", "  5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n13.  TA  implementation  is  expected  to  commence  in  October  2014  and  continue  up  to \nSeptember 2016 (24 months). SAARC will be the implementing agency, through the ministries \nof agriculture and/or livestock of SAARC member states. ADB will be the executing agency. \nEngagement of consulting services will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time).  \n \n14.  The FAO will be selected by ADB through single-source selection to implement the TA \nand deliver the required services.9 The FAO has the necessary expertise at global, regional, and \nnational levels to provide technical and operational services to deliver TA activities. The FAO is \nthe only institution qualified, with technical expertise and experience for the assignment.  The \nFAO plays an important role in managing and coordinating development partner inputs to TAD \ncontrol programs at country and regional levels. It has also been working closely with both \nASEAN and SAARC in the development of regional activities for HPAI control. \n   \n15.  The FAO structure in the region provides a comparative advantage for detailed technical \nproject  implementation, with  a  well-established Regional Office for  Asia  and the  Pacific  in \nBangkok. Its Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases (ECTAD) can provide full \ntechnical and administrative support. The FAO representative office in each SAARC member \ncountry provides an efficient high-level link to national animal health authorities. The FAO has a \nsignificant  team  of  technical  and  operational  personnel  in  the  field,  and  this  TA  can  be \ncomplemented by their activities. Single-source selection is justified, as the envisaged TA tasks \nrepresent continuity of the ongoing EU-funded regional cooperation program on HPEDs being \nimplemented by the FAO.  \n \n16.  The  FAO  will  propose  a  team  comprising  144  person-months  of  international  and \n48 person-months of national consulting services to deliver TA activities. All procurement will \nfollow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). The FAO will be \npaid on a time-based contract basis. The RSU in Kathmandu, Nepal will implement the project \nactivities.  A  project  steering  committee\u2014composed  of  the  SAARC  Secretariat,  experts \nrepresenting each of the participating countries, the FAO, and ADB\u2014will be established to \nprovide  (i) overall  strategic  and  policy  directions,  (ii)  guidance  and  oversight,  and \n(iii) implementation guidelines to the project and RSU. The FAO will (i) ensure transparency and \naccountability; (ii) facilitate administrative procedures; and (iii) provide legal assistance, where \napplicable. All disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with the Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The equipment \nprocured under the TA will be turned over to the SAARC Secretariat upon TA completion. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION  \n17.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction for the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation \nFood Security Through Control of Transboundary Animal Diseases.  \n \n \n                                                \n9 Arrangements with FAO will comply with the ADB\u2013FAO 1981 Memorandum of Understanding.  \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n    Data Sources and   \n  Performance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact  By 2018:    Assumptions \nImproved control  Morbidity rate for livestock decreased  FAO, OIE, WHO,  SAARC and \nof the priority  from 50% in 2012 to 30%    and European  member countries \nTADs in affected    Commission data  remain committed \nzones of SAARC  Mortality rate of livestock decreased  and reports  to TAD control  \ncountries  from 70% in 2012 to 35%        \n    No new disease of \n  high impact \n  emerges during the \nproject period \n \nOutcome  By 2016:  FAO, OIE, and  Risk \nImproved  Compliance with international sanitary  WHO regional joint  Natural disasters \ncompliance with  and phytosanitary standards improved  reports on  and price shocks \ninternational  from 30% in 2012 to 50% in affected  diseases   for livestock and \nsanitary  zones      livestock products \nand phytosanitary    significantly affect \nstandards in the  livestock \nSAARC region  development \n     \nOutputs    By 2016:     Assumption \n1.
