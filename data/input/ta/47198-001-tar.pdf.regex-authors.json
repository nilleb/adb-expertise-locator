The Government of Mongolia requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \ntechnical assistance (TA) to strengthen the state audit capacity in Mongolia.1 A TA fact-finding \nmission on 26\u201328 June 2013 reached agreement with the government on the impact, outcome, \noutputs, implementation arrangements, costs, financial arrangements, and terms of reference \nfor consulting services of the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Since 1991 as its economy has transitioned from a planned economy, Mongolia has \nprogressively initiated to strengthen its legal framework for auditing, improving transparency and \naccountability of economic activities to facilitate the adoption of a market economic system. A \nkey initiative was the adoption in 1997 of the Law on Audit, which was subsequently amended in \n2001,  2003,  2005,  and  2006.  The  law  governs  auditing  principles,  organization,  and \nadministration for registering auditing companies, and requires meeting international standards, \nnotably the International Standards on Auditing (ISA).3 Furthermore, Mongolia adopted the \nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as its standards for financial reporting in \n2006.4 \n \n3.  In addition to the Law on Audit, the adoption of the State Audit Law in 2003 strengthened \nthe public audit system in Mongolia and transferred the responsibility of public audits from the \nState Audit Board to the Mongolian National Audit Office (MNAO). The MNAO is responsible for \nauditing the annual financial statements of all government entities and state-owned enterprises. \nIn 2013, the MNAO expanded its responsibilities to include the auditing of projects financed by \ninternational financial institutions (IFIs) and bilateral institutions. This ensured compliance with \nthe Integrated Budget Law passed in 2011.5 The MNAO now performs the public auditing and is \nmaking an important contribution to enhanced financial transparency and accountability of the \npublic sector. \n \n4.  While the legal and regulatory framework of auditing has been strengthened, there is still \na significant gap between actual practice and the required standards set in laws. A priority in the \npublic  sector  is  to  ensure  that  the  MNAO  fully  applies  international  standards  to  its  audit \nmethodology and procedures. \n \n5.  The ISA is a set of professional standards for auditing. In addition, the International \nStandards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAI), aligned with the ISA, were introduced in 2007 \nas the international standards of auditing for the public sector.6 The ISSAI\u2014a comprehensive \n                                                 \n1  The TA is included in ADB. 2013. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2013. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 September 2013.  \n3  The ISA is a set of standards for the professional practice of auditing issued by the International Federation of \nAccountants through the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. \n4  Since the European Union adopted the IFRS in 2005, the IFRS has rapidly expanded worldwide. Developing \ncountries that had not fully developed their own standards on financial reporting also adopted the IFRS as their \nfinancial reporting standards. More than 100 countries have adopted the IFRS as their financial reporting standards \nor have converged their standards with the IFRS as of 2011. \n5  The Integrated Budget Law (2011) categorizes IFI-financed projects as budgetary entities on which the MNAO \nneeds to perform financial audits. This includes ADB and World Bank loan and grant projects. Since 2013, the \nMNAO has taken over the audit responsibility from the Ministry of Finance on ADB projects and has engaged \nprivate audit firms to audit ADB projects due to the Ministry of Finance\u2019s limited staffing capacity.  \n6  The International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions aligned ISA with public sector auditing to ensure the \naccuracy and credibility of financial statements in the public sector based on accrual-based accounting. All \n ", "2  \nand updated collection of professional standards and best practices\u2014provides guidance for \npublic sector auditors in applying the ISA to financial audit. However, the MNAO has not applied \nthe ISSAI to its audit procedures and methodologies yet. \n \n6.  Due to a lack of resources, the MNAO lacks professional training and experience in \nISSAI and in the requirements for auditing accrual-based financial statements. There is also a \nneed to significantly improve the MNAO\u2019s audit quality control process to ensure credibility of its \nfinancial auditing. To improve the efficiency and quality of the auditing, the MNAO also needs to \nstrengthen the information technology system, such as adopting audit software for its audit \nactivities and connecting the network of the head office in Ulaanbaatar and local subsidiaries.  \n \n7.  ADB\u2019s  Mongolia  Country  Partnership  Strategy,  2012\u20132016  identified  two  pillars  of \nsupport for the generation of sustained and diversified employment: (i) competitive, sustainable, \nand  regionally  integrated  growth  and  (ii)  inclusive  social  development.7 In  line  with  ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2020, in which good governance is a driver of change, ADB will help improve the \ngovernment\u2019s financial management and effectiveness of public expenditure.8 Improving the \nquality of the MNAO\u2019s auditing is fundamental toward achieving this objective. \n \n8.  To  address  the  MNAO\u2019s  capacity  constraints,  the  TA  will  review  the  framework, \nprocedures, and methodologies of financial auditing and audit quality control, and produce a \nfeasibility study on the selection and adoption of information technology and software for the \nMNAO\u2019s audit activities. The TA will provide professional training on financial auditing and audit \nquality control for the MNAO (about 30 MNAO\u2019s auditors), private audit firms, and relevant \nprofessional organizations, including developing training materials based on the ISSAI, ISA, \nIFRS, and International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS).9 The TA will develop \ngeneral audit guidelines and an audit quality control manual for IFI-financed projects, and \nenhance  relevant  government  officials\u2019  awareness  of  the  need  for  continued  capacity \ndevelopment to improve the quality of financial auditing in Mongolia. The TA will facilitate \nimplementation  of  the  MNAO\u2019s  strategic  plan  for  2013\u20132018,  which  aims  to  ensure  full \ncompliance with international audit standards. \n \n9.  The TA is a continuation of the support ADB has provided since the mid-1990s for \nstrengthening audit capacity in Mongolia.10 Previous ADB support helped draft accounting and \nauditing laws, improved accounting systems of private and public entities to comply with the \nInternational  Accounting  Standards,  and  strengthened  the  capacity  of  accountants.  The \nproposed TA will extend this assistance by helping further improve public audit quality and align \npublic sector auditing with international standards and best practice. \n \n                                                                                                                                                          \ndocuments complied with in the ISSAI are officially authorized and endorsed by the International Organization of \nSupreme Audit Institutions. \n7  ADB. 2012.

The Accounting Policy Department in the Ministry of Finance plays an important role in monitoring \naudit quality. In addition, the Mongolia Institute of Certified Public Accountants is an important institute for domestic \naccountancy professions. \n10 ADB. 1995 and 1997.

ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy 2011 promotes transparency and requires that \nproject audit reports be posted on the ADB website.11 With the development of appropriate audit \nguidelines and an audit quality control manual for IFI-financed projects, the quality of audit \nreports prepared by the MNAO will be improved and disclosed in a timely manner to meet \nADB\u2019s requirements. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact will be improved quality of the MNAO\u2019s financial auditing, which will be \nmeasured by assessing whether the MNAO\u2019s financial auditing complies with the ISSAI and ISA. \nThe outcome will be improved financial auditing and audit quality control capacity of targeted \nauditors  from  the  MNAO  and  private  audit  firms,  which  will  be  measured  through  a  pre-\nintervention and post-training skills assessment. \n   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will achieve the outcome through four major outputs: \n \n(i)  Assessment of the MNAO\u2019s current financial auditing and audit quality control \nframework, procedures, and methodologies, with a review of general financial \nreporting framework and practices of public auditing, focusing on (a) a feasibility \nstudy of selecting and adopting needed information technology and software for  \nthe MNAO to improve the quality and efficiency of its audit activities and (b) \npolicy recommendations for strengthening financial auditing and audit quality \ncontrol framework, procedures and methodologies. \n(ii)  General audit guidelines and an audit quality control manual for IFI-financed \nprojects. \n(iii)  Capacity development of (a) conducting financial audit, covering audit for public \nentities and IFI-financed projects and (b) audit quality control, including skills \nassessment of targeted auditors, development of training materials, and post-\ntraining skills assessment, based on ISSAI, ISA, IFRS, and IPSAS. \n(iv)  Enhancement  of  relevant  government  officials\u2019  and  other  stakeholders\u2019 \nawareness of the need for continued capacity development to improve the quality \nof financial auditing in Mongolia. \n \n13.  To deliver the planned outputs, the consulting team leader will develop a detailed work \nplan in consultation with the MNAO. The consulting team will conduct a skills assessment of \ntargeted  auditors,  including  auditors  from  the  MNAO,  private  audit  firms,  and  relevant \nprofessional organizations such as the Mongolia Institute of Certified Public Accounts. Based on \nthe skills assessment, the consulting team will specify the details of training and develop training \nmaterials. As part of the training materials, the consulting team will translate the ISSAI into \nMongolian, focusing on documents related to financial audit at level 4.12 The ISSAI will be \nindicated  as  the  source  in  the  final  translated  documents.  ADB  will  own  the  translated \ndocuments, subject to the policies of the owners of the original documents. The consulting team \n                                                 \n11 According to the Public Communications Policy 2011, ADB shall post on its website annual audited project \naccounts for sovereign projects for which the invitation to negotiate is issued on or after 2 April 2012.  \n12 ISSAI consists of four levels of document: the first level summarizes founding principles, the second lists \nprerequisites for the functioning of Supreme Audit Institutions, the third presents fundamental auditing principles, \nand the fourth covers auditing guidelines covering financial audit, compliance audit, and performance audit. \n ", "4  \nwill provide professional training on financial audit and audit quality control for targeted auditors, \nand conduct post-training assessments. \n \n14.  The TA will also review MNAO\u2019s financial auditing and audit quality control framework, \nprocedures, and methodologies. In addition, the TA will produce general audit guidelines and an \naudit quality control manual for IFI-financed projects. A workshop will be organized for relevant \ngovernment officials to enhance awareness of the need for continued capacity development to \nimprove financial auditing in Mongolia. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $320,000, of which $300,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart  support  in  the  form  of  office  accommodation;  data  and  documents  for  the \nconsultants; counterpart staff; logistical support, including costs of meeting arrangements; and \nother in-kind contributions.
