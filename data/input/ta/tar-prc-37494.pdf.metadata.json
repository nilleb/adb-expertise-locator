During the 2003 Country Programming Mission of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) confirmed its request for technical \nassistance (TA) to prepare an integrated roads development project (the Project) in Hunan \nProvince. ADB\u2019s Fact-Finding Mission visited the project area in March 2004, carried out rapid \nenvironmental assessment and an initial poverty and social assessment (IPSA), and collected \nnecessary  information.  This  paper  is  based  on  the  understandings  reached  with  the \nGovernment on the objectives, scope, costs, consultants\u2019 term of reference, and implementation \narrangements for the TA, and the Mission\u2019s observations in the field. The preliminary is included \nin ADB\u2019s 2004 program for the PRC,1 and the proposed loan is included in the 2005 program. \nThe project framework is attached in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The  PRC\u2019s  economic  growth  since  the  1980s  has  resulted  in  an  unprecedented \nexpansion in intra- and inte-rprovincial traffic. The economy\u2019s changing structure and increasing \ndiversification have altered the pattern of transport demand. The demand for road transport has \noutpaced  that  of  other  transport  modes.  Movement  of  goods  and  passengers  by  road  is \nincreasing rapidly, and is more flexible and responsive than other modes to the needs of a \nmarket economy. The shift in transport demand also reflects the loosening of anticompetitive \nrestrictions in the road transport industry. Between 1990 and 2003, road traffic grew around \n9.6% per annum for passenger traffic, reaching 769.6 billion passenger-kilometers (km); and \naround 5.7% per annum for freight, reaching 708 billion ton-km. In 2003, road traffic accounted \nfor 55.7% of the country\u2019s total passenger traffic and 13.2% of total freight traffic. With the \ncountry\u2019s rapid economic growth, low vehicle ownership rates, lower car prices after World \nTrade Organization accession, increasing access to loans to finance automobile purchases, and \ninvestment in automotive manufacturing ($6 billion were provided by the state banks during \n2001\u20132003), the fast expansion in vehicle fleets will continue in the coming years. ADB supports \nthe improvement of road transport efficiency and service quality through its TA program.2  \n \n3.  Despite the huge investment, the road network is still underdeveloped in both quality and \nextent, and does not provide access to large parts of the country, particularly in the poorer \ninland regions. High-standard roads (above class II)3 account for only 12% of the total network. \nThe remaining 88% are medium- to low-grade paved roads and gravel roads. The road density is \nlow,  with  only  1,100  km  of  roads  for  every  1  million  inhabitants,  although  the  density  has \nincreased from 12.1 km per 100 square kilometer (km2) in 1995 to 18.6 km per 100 km2 in 2003. \nThe growing road transport demand has put a strain on the road infrastructure, as manifested \nby the congestion and bottlenecks in the network. Weaknesses in the road network have \nresulted in high transport and logistics cost between interior provinces and the coastal ports.4 \n \n4.  Transport conditions for the rural poor are not adequate in the PRC. Many of the rural \npoor in the country reside in partial or full isolation, which bloats their transportation costs and \nthus restricts their access to basic goods and services. This limitation keeps the poor from \n                                                 \n1  The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 26 January 2004. \n2  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the People's Republic of China for Policy Reform in Road Transport. Manila. \n3  High standard roads include expressway, class I, and class II highways. \n4  The shortage of adequate road networks has slowed economic growth and regional development. Earlier TA \nconcluded that low-quality road infrastructure in poor areas is a major obstacle to economic growth. ADB. 1998. \nTechnical Assistance to the People's Republic of China for Regional Road Sector Study. Manila. A World Bank \nstudy argued that the annual economic costs of not having adequate transport infrastructure in the PRC in the \n1980s amounted to 1% of its gross national product (World Development Report, 1994). ", "2    \ntaking advantage of job opportunities generated by the process of economic growth. Access by \nreliable transport to input and output markets stimulates higher production in cash-crop farming, \nthereby speeding up the transition from subsistence farming to a market economy. Upgraded \nrural transport also increases the nonfarm income opportunities of the rural poor. Linking the \ndepressed rural areas to the economic centers will make education and health facilities more \neasily available to them. \n \n5.  To meet the growing demand for improved access to markets and services, and to build \na conducive environment to the private sector, the Government has made major efforts to \nincrease the country\u2019s road capacity. The heart of the road network development strategy is the \nNational Trunk Highway System (NTHS), a 35,000 km system of interprovincial expressways \nand high-class highways to be constructed over 20 years (target completion: 2007). The NTHS \nwill be complemented by the development of a network of national, provincial, county, and \ntownship roads. The Government\u2019s road development policies are: (i) constructing expressways \nto  expand  the  NTHS  and  link  all  cities  that  have  a  population  more  than  500,000;  and  \n(ii) developing secondary roads, particularly those that will help reduce poverty and promote \nrural markets. The Government adopted the Western Region Development Strategy, a key \ntheme of the 10th Five-Year Plan (2001\u20132005), to enhance economic development in the \nwestern part of the country, where most of the poor reside. The strategy aims to reduce the \ndisparity between the western and coastal regions, and assigns a high priority to road sector \ndevelopment as a means to promote economic growth and poverty reduction in the western \nregion. To implement the Government\u2019s policies, the National Rural Road Development Plan \nhas been drafted. The plan aims to link all county centers with high-class highways (above class \nII), to provide all township centers with paved road access, and to ensure that all administrative \nvillages have all-weather road access.5 Hunan Province also formulated its own 10 year road \ndevelopment plan (2001\u20132010), extending networks of local (county and township) roads and \nenhancing road connections among regions and provinces. \n \n6.  Hunan, in the central-western part of the PRC and in the middle reaches of the Yangtze \nRiver, is bordered by Jiangxi to the east, Chongqing and Guizhou to the west, Guangdong and \nGuangxi to the south, and Hubei to the north. In 2003, the region\u2019s per capita gross domestic \nproduct  was  CNY6,549,  85%  of  the  national  average.  Agriculture  is  the  mainstay  of  the \neconomy, employing 69% of the labor force. The major agricultural products\u2014ramie, wheat, \nrice, corn, tea, citrus fruits, and soybeans\u23afare grown in the Yuan Valley, through which the \nProject passes. Hunan has a potential for industrial development. Its industrial output grew over \n20% per annum during 2000\u20132003. The leading industrial sectors include steel, nonferrous \nmetals, coal, oil and chemical processing, machinery, and textiles. The demand for Hunan's \nproducts from other provinces has increased sharply in recent years. However, weaknesses in \nroad infrastructure development lag, failing to adequately support economic growth. About 86% \nof the roads in Hunan are below class III. The national highway (NR319), which runs parallel to \nthe proposed expressway and currently serves as a link to major trading destinations such as \nChongqing, is a combination of class III and lower roads. The pavement is in poor condition. \nTwo thirds of the road is frequently congested and nonmotorized traffic interferes with fast \nmoving traffic. These two factors contribute to frequent accidents and poor safety. Traffic on \nNR319 has grown at around 7.3% per annum in the past few years and will exceed its capacity \nat several points by 2008. \n \n                                                 \n5  Rural roads will be developed in three stages. By 2005, the total extent of rural roads will be 1.6 million km; by \n2010, 1.85 million km, connecting 100% townships and administrative villages in the PRC; and by 2020, 2.5 million \nkm and transport services will be provided to administrative village level. ", "    3\n7.  The expressway from Jishou to Chadong proposed under the Project will constitute a \n75.3 km section of the Changsha-Chongqing western corridor, one of the eight priority western \ncorridors included in the 10th Five-Year Plan.6 With this proposed expressway, the journey time \nfrom Jishou to Chadong will be reduced by 2 hours. The Project is in the western part of Hunan, \npassing through the Xiangxi Autonomous Prefecture of Tujia and Miao Nationalities\u23afone of the \nwell-known poverty areas in the PRC. The project area includes Jishou City and two counties in \nXiangxi Prefecture: Baojin and Huayuan.7 The project area is largely rural and mountainous with \nlimited accessibility. The project area has a total population of 833,000, of which 74% is rural. In \n2002, per capita rural income was CNY1,267 for Baojin County, CNY1,181 for Huayuan County, \nand  CNY1,881  for  Jishou  City.  The  proportion  of  rural  population  is  86%  in  Baojin,  85% \nHuayuan, and 53% Jishou. The Project will open the region by linking the west to the east, and \npromoting economic development. It will also improve the quality of life for local people, with \nbetter access to social services, including reduced transport costs and travel time to seek health \ncare. The project area has 431 health clinics and 555 primary schools. \n \n8.  ADB and the Government have had extensive discussions on how to maximize the \npoverty reduction impact of road investments. The location of ADB-financed road sector projects \nhas shifted from the northeast and coastal areas to the poorer central, northwest and southwest \nregions. To strengthen the impacts on poverty reduction, since 1995 the scope of the ADB-\nfinanced  road  projects  has  been  broadened  to  include  improvements  to  local  roads,  thus \nproviding better access to poor counties and townships.8 In line with ADB\u2019s policy dialogue, a \nlocal road improvement program will be integrated into the Project. The proposed TA will \ndetermine  the  scope  of  the  local  road  improvement  component  that  will  complement  the \nexpressway. The integrated approach will help spread the expressway benefits to the poor.  \nBetter tie-ins between the expressway and local roads will help rural agricultural products reach \nmarkets and allow farmers to upgrade farming practices. \n \n9.  ADB\u2019s operating strategy in the PRC\u2019s road sector supports (i) constructing roads that \nconnect major growth centers with hinterland economies; (ii) integrating the network, so that the \nNTHS is supported by a system of local roads, particularly those that provide access to poor \nareas; (iii) enhancing the provision of transport services to the poor; (iv) promoting road safety \nand  reducing  vehicle  emissions;  (v)  institutional  strengthening  to  increase  the  commercial \norientation and managerial efficiency in expressway operations; (vi) adopting appropriate pricing \npolicies to ensure the optimization of road transport capacity; and (vii) using alternative methods \nof investment financing, including private sector participation.  \n \n10.   The project preparatory work is well advanced. The feasibility study for the Project was \nsubmitted  to  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission  in  December  2003  and  its \napproval is expected by October 2004. The preliminary design is expected to complete by  \n30 November 2004. Within 6 months of the completion of the preliminary design, the detailed \ndesign  will  complete.  An  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  will  be  completed  by  \n30 November 2004. Preparation of the resettlement plan will start in October 2004 and be \ncompleted by 31 December 2004. The IPSA and rapid environmental assessment carried out \n                                                 \n6  The Changsha-Changde section of the Chansha-Chongqing corridor was opened to traffic in 1999. The Changde-\nHuaihua section (174 km) of the corridor is to be implemented by ADB under the Hunan Road Development II \nProject. The Huaihua-Jishou section, financed by the Government, commenced its civil works in 2004. With the \nconstruction of Jishou-Chadong expressway, the Changsha-Chongqing corridor will be complete. \n7  The prefecture comprises 8 counties with the total population of 2.6 million (in 2002), of which 83% are rural.  \nThe minority population accounts for 73% of the total population, consisting predominantly of Miao and Tuija. Its \nper capita rural income in 2002 was CNY1,325.  \n8  Thirteen projects have a local road improvement program, such as the Chengdu-Nanchong Expressway Project, \nGuangxi Roads Development Project, and Shaanxi Roads Development Project. ", "4    \nduring  fact-finding  identified  the  key  social  and  environmental  issues  that  will  need  to  be \nanalyzed further during project preparation. The rapid environmental assessment and summary \nIPSA are in Appendix 2. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n11.  The TA will help the Government prepare an integrated roads development project to \nsupport pro-poor economic growth and reduce poverty in the project area.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The  TA  will  assist  the  Hunan  Provincial  Communications  Department  (HPCD)  to  \n(i) refine the feasibility study, including the EIA and summary EIA, resettlement plan, and \npoverty  impact  analysis  for  the  proposed  Project,  in  conformity  with  ADB\u2019s  requirements;  \n(ii) review the project design and scope to make the Project more pro-poor, including the need \nto integrate a local roads and feeder roads component into the Project; (iii) identify important \nsocioeconomic indicators and the monitoring mechanisms; (iv) confirm the technical, economic, \nand financial viability of the proposed investments; (v) review and update transport and road \nprofiles; (vi) review the externally financed road projects to improve the efficiency of expressway \noperations; and (vii) discuss the major policy issues, assess the poverty impact of the Project, \nand propose measures for maximizing the positive impacts on the poor population in the project \narea.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $625,000 equivalent, comprising $363,000 of \nforeign  exchange  cost  and  $262,000  equivalent  of  local  currency  cost.  ADB  will  provide \n$500,000  equivalent  to  cover  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  a  portion  of  the  local \ncurrency cost amounting to $137,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB's TA funding program. HPCD will finance the remaining $125,000 equivalent to cover the \ncosts of office accommodation and support services, local communications, local transport, \noffice supplies, and other facilities and services required for the implementation of the TA.  \nThe detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 3. The Government has been advised that approval \nof the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  A team of international consultants in association with domestic consulting firm(s) will be \nengaged using the simplified technical proposal procedures based on the quality- and cost-\nbased selection method and in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the selection and engagement of domestic \nconsultants. The TA will require a total of 28 person-months of consulting services, including  \n13 person-months of international and 15 person-months of domestic consultancy, to carry out \nthe  study,  as  defined  in  the  outline  terms  of  reference  (Appendix  4).  The  international \nconsultants will provide expertise in (i) highway and structural engineering, including traffic \nforecast  analysis;  (ii)  tunnel  engineering;  (iii)  transport  economics;  (iv)  financial  analysis, \nexpressway management, and private sector participation in expressways; (v) resettlement \nplanning;  (vi)  poverty  and  socioeconomic  analysis;  and  (vii)  environmental  aspects.  \nThe  domestic  consultants  will  have  expertise  in  (i)  highway  and  structure  engineering,  ", "    5\n(ii)  transport  economics  and  financial  analysis,  (iii)  socioeconomic  and  resettlement,  and  \n(iv) environment engineering.  \n \n15.  The Government and ADB agree to include this TA as one of the projects under the Pilot \nStudy for Delegation of Consultant Recruitment and Supervision under Technical Assistance to \nExecuting Agencies (Pilot Study)9 approved by ADB. In particular, the Government agrees to \nfollow  the  implementation  procedures  outlined  in  the  pilot  study  and  such  other  detailed \nprocedures and practices as the ADB may require from time to time. The Government has \nacknowledged that the terms and conditions of the Technical Assistance Framework Agreement \n(TAFA) executed between the Government and ADB apply to this TA. Pursuant to Section 3.01 \nof the TAFA, ADB has agreed to delegate consultant selection and supervision for firms under \nthis TA to the Government. The TA letter agreement to be issued under the TAFA for this TA \nwill accordingly reflect this arrangement. \n \n16.  HPCD will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will be responsible for supervision \nand monitoring of TA activities, including consultant recruitment and supervision, and liaison \nwith government agencies and organizations. HPCD will also provide office accommodation and \ntransport  arrangement.  The  TA  will  start  in  November  2004,  when  the  consultants  are \nscheduled to be fielded. The consulting services will be carried out over a 5 month period, with \nthe TA due to be completed by April 2005. HPCD will provide ADB and the consultants with the \nfeasibility study; engineering studies; EIA; resettlement plan; and any other materials, recent \nstudies, and reports required for the implementation of the TA.
