The Government of the Philippines (the Government), through the National Economic and \nDevelopment  Authority  (NEDA),  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide  an \nadvisory technical assistance (TA) for Strengthening Provincial and Local Planning and Expenditure \nManagement. The TA is included in the 2004 country program for the Philippines. A preparatory work \nto investigate the problems and issues in provincial planning and expenditure management has been \nprepared.1 A Fact-Finding Mission was fielded 14-30 July 2004 and reached understanding with the \nGovernment on the objective, scope, cost estimate, financing and implementation arrangements of \nthe TA. This builds on the ADB-World Bank-Government report \u201cPublic Expenditure, Procurement \nand Financial Management Review\u201d, jointly conducted in 2003. The TA framework is in Appendix \n1.2\n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Given the devolved responsibilities of local government units (LGUs) at all levels under the \n1991 Local Government Code (LGC)3 of the Philippines, LGUs, especially the provincial planning \nand development offices, can play a crucial role in local economic development, poverty reduction \nand regional development. Currently, the provincial/local planning work is relatively weak and lacks \nthe fundamental linkages to expenditure management, revenue collection and project investments \nat  the  provincial,  regional  and  national  levels.  There  is  a  need  to  strengthen  capabilities  for \nprovincial planning and expenditure management to link the provincial development plan (PDP) \nwith the annual investment plan (AIP), budget preparation and investment financing; to streamline \ninstitutional management, consolidate several provincial development guidelines into an integrated \nguideline;  and  to  provide  follow-up  training  to  help  provincial  planners  and  development \ncoordinators use the new guidelines in their work. These activities will contribute significantly to \nbridging the gap between LGU resource capacities and expenditure needs. To streamline the \nprocedures  for  national  and  local  planning,  budgeting,  revenue  collection,  and  investment \nfinancing, it  is  also  necessary  to strengthen  institutional collaboration  and  cooperation  at  the \nnational level, especially among the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), the \nDepartment of Budget Management (DBM), the Department of the Interior and Local Government \n(DILG), and the Department of Finance (DOF). The current fragmented management system has \nadversely affected overall management of these processes. Strengthening the planning-investment \nfinancing can also help improve the Government\u2019s efficiency. The TA supports ADB\u2019s Philippine \ncountry  strategy  in  poverty  reduction,  decentralization,  regional  development,  and  good \ngovernance. \n \n3.  The PDP, which is mandated under the LGC for laying out provincial planning, has little \ninfluence on eventual provincial investment decisions, budgeting and project implementation. It is \nessentially a technical document that is not usually used in the AIP preparation. In the provinces \nwhere links are close between the PDP and the AIP, projects are normally implemented smoothly \nand coincide with development priorities highlighted in the PDP. Otherwise, the AIP preparation is \nnot directly linked with the PDP and usually provinces end up implementing projects that differ from \nthe priorities specified in the PDP. LGUs use alternative processes in preparing the PDP and the \nAIP. In some provinces, the planning office prepares both the PDP and the AIP, while in others the \nPDP and the AIP are prepared separately with or without collaboration of the planning office and \nthe budget office. Obviously the former process is more effective and has normally led to good \ninvestment  financing,  while  the  latter  process  requires  collaboration  between  the  provincial \n                                                 \n1 \u201cPreparatory Work for the Proposed Technical Assistance on Strengthening Provincial Planning and Expenditure \nManagement\u201d. www.adb.org/phco. \n2 The TA was first listed in The ADB Business Opportunities on 28 June 2004. \n3 Based on the Local Government Code 1991, currently there are 79 provinces, 115 cities, 1495 municipalities and \n41,956 barangays. ", "2 \nplanning and budget offices with support from local chief executives (LCEs) (including provincial \ngovernors, city and municipal mayors). Insufficient interface among agencies at various levels \nresults in poor investment financing decision and wastage. There is a need to influence LCEs to \nbetter  understand  technicalities  and  be  more  involved  in  provincial/local  planning,  budgeting, \nrevenue  collection  and  investment  financing.  If  LCEs  adopt  more  rigorous  and  coordinated \ndevelopment plans and programs, the PDP process and its implementation will be effective. \n \n4.  There are multiple and outdated development guidelines and formats issued by various \nagencies  and  institutions  and  these  confuse  planning  offices  in  PDP  preparation  and  make \ncoordination of the PDP formulation complex.  Some  guidelines that were issued before 1991 are \nnot attuned to the reforms introduced under the LGC. There is need to streamline administrative \nprocedures  and  arrangements,  and  to  prepare  an  integrated  set  of  guidelines  to  strengthen \nprovincial planning and expenditure management. The new guidelines should be well integrated, \nsimple and user friendly. \n \n5.  The quality of the PDP among the LGUs is uneven. Key areas for improvement include \ngiving more dynamic dimensions to situation analyses by adopting sound assumptions for trends \nand growth rates; and developing projections effectively. There is further need for strengthening \nlinkages between analysis on one hand, and identification of objectives, strategies, programs, and \nprojects on the other; and prioritizing identified problems and issues, as well as proposed programs \nand projects. Provincial planning capacity is generally inadequate. Although provincial planning \ndevelopment offices (PPDO) understand the planning process, a major constraint is that few \nPPDO technical personnel have formal planning expertise (less than 2% have any formal planning \ndegree). PPDO productivity is also hampered by additional assignments unrelated to the planning \nmandate. Moreover, development priorities are not clearly defined in the PDP, mainly because of \nthe lack of capacity of planning officers. \n \n6.  Heavy reliance on the internal revenue allotment (IRA)4 makes LGUs reluctant to search for \nother financial resources for local development. LGUs rely on the IRA for more than 55% of their \nbudget  revenue.  Major  financial  resource  allocation  distortion  in  the  planning  system  is  the \ncongressional development fund (CDF) or Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF), which is \nallocated to members of Congress for discretionary spending within LGUs. These funds have been \nchanneled to local developments in a nontransparent way for projects not necessarily aligned with \nthe PDPs, and dilute the already limited public resources. This implies that only a limited portion of \nthe CDF serves local development purposes. Moreover, this trend has been adopted by members \nof Sanggunian5 at various levels, further depriving the limited resources for development.  \n \n7.  Local expenditure management and revenue collection capacity should be strengthened. \nCurrently,  more  than  50%  of  IRA  has  been  used  for  personnel  services  and  local  revenue \ncollection accounts for less than 10% of total expenditures. Unless provinces can significantly \nimprove their own-source revenue effort and/or tap non-traditional financing sources, they will \nremain  dependent  on  their  IRA  to  finance  provincial  development  funds.  The  ability  of  the \nprovinces to increase own-source revenue is hampered by the poor linkage between planning and \nbudgeting,  weak  tax  administration,  large  allocations  for  personnel  services  and  contracted \npersons, and constraints in LGU credit/capital financing framework.    \n \n \n                                                 \n4 The IRA is the inter-government financing mechanism by which 40% of revenues collected by the National Government \nare channeled to LGUs for development spending. \n5  Local congresses. ", "    3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The goal of the TA is to help provinces and some selected cities improve their capacities for \neffective  planning  and  budget  management  to  strengthen  LGU  service  delivery  and  pro-poor \neconomic development. The TA will help develop approaches and methods for strengthening \nprovincial/local  planning  and  expenditure  management  by  establishing  efficient  provincial/local \nplanning, budgeting, revenue collection and investment financial framework.  \n \n9.  The  TA  will  consist  of  four  interrelated  components:  (i)  enhancing  cooperation  and \ncollaboration of national agencies and LGUs to consolidate the planning-budgeting-investment \nlinkages; (ii) preparing new planning, budgeting and investment guidelines; (iii) capacity-building \ntraining  for  governors  and  city  mayors,  and  planning,  budgeting  and  treasury  officers  at \nprovincial/local levels; and (iv) enhancing local expenditure management, revenue collections and \nproject evaluation. The TA will target LGUs at provincial and city levels. However, consultations will \nbe focused on five pilot regions: Cordillera Administrative Region, Cavite-Laguna-Batangas-Rizal-\nQuezon Region, Western Visayas, Eastern Visayas, and Western Mindanao. The pilot regions \nwere  selected  after  full  consultation  with  national  and  local  government  agencies  with \nconsideration of geographic distribution, poverty incidence, responsiveness to the TA preparatory \nwork and capacity to benefit from the TA.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  Strengthening the Planning-Budgeting-Investment Linkages. The first set of activities \npertains to strengthening linkages of the PDP, the Provincial Physical Framework Plan (PPFP), \nbudget and the AIP. Strengthening these linkages will help ensure that projects are derived from \ntechnically sound planning processes that involve medium term perspectives and appropriate \nprioritization.  \n \n11.  To  address  the  above  issue,  advocacy  activities,  along  with  institutional  cooperation, \ntraining, capacity building, and performance incentives for LGUs are needed. Early in the TA \nprogram, a consultation workshop will be conducted to brief LCEs on best practice for local fiscal \nmanagement, including planning, budgeting, revenue generation, investment programming, and \nproject evaluation. The workshop will cover three aspects that will subsequently be developed by \nthe TA: (i) a proposal for performance-based incentives that will be given to LGUs that are able to \nachieve improved PDP-PPFP-budget-AIP linkages; (ii) a proposal for a new set of integrated \nplanning guidelines, merging the PDP and the PPFP, and taking into consideration the sectoral \nand  existing  planning  frameworks,  including  budgeting,  revenue  generation,  investment \nprogramming and project evaluation, and (iii) based on consultations, a report on institutional \nlinkage strategies will be prepared and discussed by the steering committee. If the proposals are \nfound acceptable and feasible, corresponding legal issuances, executive order or administrative \norder will be drafted.  \n \n12.  Preparation of New Planning Guidelines.  This covers the preparation of a new set of \nplanning guidelines to ensure that provincial plans respond to needs for provincial development. \nThe guidelines will be suitable for preparing the development planning documents and should offer \na better alternative to existing guidelines for local development planning. More specifically, the \nguidelines  should:  (i)  cover  the  steps  involved  in  the  entire  planning-budgeting-investment \nprogramming process including alternative approaches to promote the LCEs\u2019 commitment to the \nprocess  and  its  outputs;  (ii)  provide  links  for  preparation  of  plans,  budgets  and  investment \nprograms; (iii) define the components and dimensions of the single local plan document; and (iv) \nconsider existing and potential planning capabilities. Preparation of the guidelines will require ", "4 \nconsultations with selected provinces and cities. Public and community-based consultations with \ncivil society, NGOs and the private sector will be organized in the process. Consultations with key \nofficials from the steering committee will also be undertaken. Prior to finalization, a draft of the \nguidelines will be given to the steering committee, and to selected NROs and PPDOs for review \nand comments.  \n \n13.  Capacity Building. Activities for the capacity building component of the TA are designed to \nhelp  ensure  that  LGU  planning  capabilities  match  requirements  for  the  new  set  of  planning \nguidelines. For purposes of the TA, the capability program will be focused on the dissemination \nand use of the new planning guidelines. Relevant LGU personnel (planning coordinators, budget \nofficers and treasurers) as well as regional development planners will be trained in applying the \nnew guidelines. They are expected to assess and make use of the guidelines in their actual \nplanning and expenditure management work. To strengthen gains from this TA, other programs \nthat may be undertaken include (i) training in project implementation; and (ii) improving databases \nfor provincial planning, budgeting, revenue collection and investment financing. This can also lay \nthe foundation for continued assistance by other donor agencies.  \n \n14.  Enhancing Local Expenditure Management and Revenue Collection. The study and \nactivities under this TA component are designed to ensure that administrative arrangements and \nresources match requirements of planning guidelines and legal issuances. The TA has proposed a \nfocused plan to enhance revenue collection and project evaluation to finance and implement plans. \nEnhancing revenue collection may have implications on roles and functions of local tax authorities \nand on delineation of responsibilities among agencies. Legal mandates may also have to be \nreviewed to ensure linkages of the planning, programming and budgeting processes. Similarly, \nproposals should be strengthened to improve the financial status and autonomy of provinces. \nThese proposals will be drawn mainly from the results of previous studies. \n \n15.  The proposed TA should result in: (i) a new set of guidelines on preparation of local \ndevelopment  planning,  budgeting,  revenue  generation,  investment  programming,  and  project \nevaluation that are well-integrated, useful, and user-friendly. The guidelines will be widely used in \nprovinces  and  cities  after  pilot  testing;  (ii)  training  workshops  on  use  of  the  new  planning \nguidelines; (iii) through the TA, improved institutional linkages, administrative arrangements and \nfinancial resources of LGUs for plan preparation, budgeting, revenue collection, and investment \nprogramming.  In  the  long  term,  the  TA  will  contribute  to  (i)  establishing  efficient  planning, \nbudgeting,  revenue  collection,  investment  financing  and project  evaluation  framework  at  local \nlevels; and (ii) better collaboration among national and local government agencies in planning and \nexpenditure management. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 equivalent, comprising $104,000 in \nforeign exchange and $396,000 equivalent in local currency. ADB will provide a grant of $350,000 to \ncover the entire foreign exchange cost and $246,000 equivalent of the local currency costs. The TA \nwill be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will contribute the \nremaining  $150,000  equivalent  in  kind,  including  office  space  in  Manila,  counterpart  staff \nremuneration,  and  secretariat  support.  The  Government  assured  the  availability  of  counterpart \nservices, facilities and funds by the TA\u2019s expected commencement date. Details of cost estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n \n ", "    5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  A steering committee, chaired by the NEDA Director-General with participation of DILG, \nDBM, DOF and LCEs, will oversee the TA implementation. The NEDA will be the TA Executing \nAgency (EA) and will coordinate with DILG, DBM and DOF. The NEDA-Regional Development \nCoordination Staff (RDCS) will be the project coordination group, and will assign counterpart staff \nto work with ADB and the consultants. The RDCS will enlist a team of ADB staff and consultants to \ncarry out the tasks and activities in the proposed TA. An Inception Mission will be fielded when the \nTA begins. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of international \nand domestic consultants.  \n \n18.  The TA will be carried out over 12 months, starting in January 2005 for completion by \nJanuary 2006. The consultants\u2019 inputs will amount to about 12 intermittent person-months. The \ninternational consultants will comprise: (i) a team leader with extensive experience in local and \nregional development planning (3 person-months); and (ii) a local/regional planning specialist who \ncan take the lead in preparing the new development guidelines (3 person-months). The domestic \nconsultants will comprise: (i) an expenditure management specialist to help draft the part on \nimproving  LGU  expenditure  management  (2  person-months);  (ii)  a  local  revenue \nmanagement/investment programming specialist to help LGUs increase revenues and provide \nguidelines on investment programming (2 person-months); and (iii) a project evaluation specialist \nto help LGUs improve their project implementation capacities (1.5 person-months). All consultants \nwill be recruited individually because the TA requires profound understanding and experience at \nlocal government levels. Detailed terms of reference for consultants are attached as Appendix 3. \n \n19.  The team of consultants will submit three major reports: (i) an inception report within 3 \nweeks after the TA commences, (ii) an interim report of TA progress within 5 months, and (iii) a \ndraft final report toward the end of the TA. In addition, the monthly progress report will be prepared. \nAfter receiving the inception report, ADB  will undertake an inception mission to the selected \nprovinces  and  cities  to  discuss  and  agree  with  the  EA,  the  steering  committee,  LGUs  and \nconsultants  on  various  milestones  of  the  TA  implementation.  A  consultation  workshop  with \nparticipation of LCEs will be held in February 2005. A TA review mission will be fielded after receipt \nof the interim report to monitor the progress of the TA implementation and make necessary \nadjustments.  A  tripartite  meeting  will  be  held  among  the  consultants,  ADB  and  Government \nagencies at the end of the TA implementation. Training workshops on the new guidelines will be \nheld in the selected regions. The consultants will prepare the final report within 15 days after the \ntripartite meeting has taken place among the steering committee, the consultants and ADB to \ndiscuss the draft final report. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n20.  The President, acting under authority delegated by the Board, has approved the provision \nof  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $350,000  on  a  grant  basis  to  the \nGovernment of the Philippines for Strengthening Provincial and Local Planning and Expenditure \nManagement, and hereby reports this action to the Board.
