THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \npolicy-based loan to the Republic of the Philippines for subprogram 2 of the Local Government \nFinance and Fiscal Decentralization Reform Program.1 \n \n2.  The program supports the government\u2019s commitment to improve service delivery by \nlocal  government  units (LGUs)  and represents  a  long-term  partnership  between the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and the government.2 The government\u2019s priorities to improve local \nservice delivery include (i) enhancing LGU access to own-revenue sources, (ii) strengthening \npublic financial management systems, (iii) improving the transparency and accountability of \nLGUs, and (iv) improving the regulatory framework for intergovernmental fiscal relations. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The development problem. The Philippines has achieved high economic growth rates, \nwhich averaged 6.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) during 2012\u20132015. However, poverty \nrates declined only marginally to 25.8% in 2014 from 27.9% in 2012. Reductions in poverty have \nnot been inclusive or evenly distributed as regional disparities have continued to widen. The \npoor are overwhelmingly concentrated in the southern regions and in rural areas. For example, \npoverty rates in the National Capital Region are less than 3%, while poverty rates exceed 48% \nin Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, and 37% in eastern Visayas and Soccsksargen. \nDisparities in access to services are also large. Only 25% of the rural population has access to \nsafe water, compared with 88% in the National Capital Region. Infant mortality rates are three \ntimes higher in the regions of Caraga, Mimaropa, or eastern Visayas compared with the capital.3 \n4.  LGUs play a central role in ensuring comparable levels of service delivery across the \nPhilippines. LGUs accounted for some 27% of total government expenditures in 2014 (excluding \ndebt  amortization),  up  from  25%  in  2011,  and  represented  approximately  4%  of  GDP.4 \nNevertheless,  the  scope  and  efficiency  of  LGU  service  delivery  are  limited.  National-local \ngovernment  relations  are  weighed  down  by  the  overlapping  and  unclear  assignments  of \nfunctions across various levels of government. This has led to duplication of efforts, inefficient \nuse of resources, and numerous mandates without funding. As a consequence, critical services \nare often not delivered, or are delivered in insufficient quantities. For example, the national \ngovernment instructs LGUs to deliver services in support of national priorities but does not \nprovide the LGUs with an appropriate level of financial resources. In either case, the welfare of \nlocal communities is adversely affected. \n5.  While a system of intergovernmental fiscal transfers\u2014the internal revenue allotment \n(IRA)\u2014provides much-needed revenues, the system is based on a rigid formulaic approach that \ndoes not consider the fiscal capacity of local governments. Compounding this issue, the ability \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014.

Manila.  \n2  Local  Government  Code.  1991.  The  Philippines has  17  regions,  81 provinces,  38  independent  cities, 107 \ncomponent cities, 1,490 municipalities, and 42,029 barangays.  \n3  Philippine Institute for Development Studies.

", "2 \nof  the  LGUs  to  self-fund  critical  activities  and  service  delivery  is  significantly  constrained. \nOverreliance on the fiscal transfers, and administrative burdens have inhibited the development \nof local tax bases and, as such, tax collection is well below potential. LGUs also face limited \naccess to the debt capital markets. This inhibits their ability to efficiently plan and execute \ninvestment programs. Finally, local public financial management (PFM) systems are outdated \nand do not ensure transparency or support effective monitoring by civil society. \n \n6.  The binding constraints. As a result, LGUs are unable to enhance local economic \ndevelopment  and  reduce  the  cost  of  doing  business  at  the  local  level.  Moreover,  the \naccountability between LGUs and their constituents that is expected from an efficient local tax \nsystem has been diluted. These issues perpetuate regional disparities in poverty reduction in a \nnumber of ways. First, regional disparities limit inclusive growth and employment-generating \nopportunities  for  the  country  as  a  whole  as  lagging  regions  struggle  to  develop  a  skilled \nworkforce  and  lack  the  conditions  necessary  for  business  development.  Second,  less \nprosperous localities are unlikely to develop good governance practices, including transparent \nand efficient service delivery systems, due to a lack of accountability between constituents and \ntheir local governments. This lack of basic services restrains the development prospects of the \nPhilippines. Third, the resultant weakness in revenue collection increases pressure on the \nnational government to provide fiscal transfers, which affects fiscal stability and sustainability. \n \n7.  During 2010\u20132013, ADB supported the government\u2019s efforts to address the first set of \ndevelopment constraints: (i) inadequate and inequitable resource mobilization, (ii) weaknesses \nin PFM systems at the national and local levels, and (iii) ineffective feedback and accountability \nsystems (footnote 1). Subprogram 1 strengthened the demand side of the decentralized system \nof government by introducing performance-based monitoring systems and grants mechanisms, \nand improved the transparency and accountability of LGUs. Subprogram 1 also began the \ndevelopment of a medium- to long-term fiscal decentralization road map and launched an \nambitious first-ever review of the Local Government Code (LGC) of 1991. The review, which \nwas supported by ADB, covered the LGC\u2019s fiscal provisions and identified the next set of \ndevelopment constraints as well as a framework to further improve intergovernmental fiscal \nrelations. Subprogram 2 will now address this remaining set of development constraints. The \nLGC,  which  interconnects  and  anchors  the  activities  of  LGUs,  suffers  from  structural \ndeficiencies that prevent an equitable distribution of fiscal transfers, limit the size of own-source \ntax revenue available to LGUs, and restrict their ability to access debt capital markets. This \nlimits the capacity of LGUs to efficiently deliver services that are responsive to the needs of their \nconstituents. In response, the government has embarked on a sequenced reform program that \nwill address the following constraints (discussed in paras 8 to 11) by prioritizing those that do \nnot require a change in law while simultaneously pursuing an effort to amend the LGC.  \n \n8.  LGUs have a limited capacity to raise revenue. Highly urbanized centers are able to \ngenerate large amounts of revenues from local taxes, while rural LGUs are not. Overall, tax \nassessment mechanisms and the capacity of LGUs to collect tax  in coordination with the \nnational government need to be improved. Tax and nontax revenues for LGUs accounted for \n34% of their total operating income in 2014. However, this metric is misleading as LGU finances \nare still highly dependent on fiscal transfers from the national government. For example, local \ntax revenue of all provinces in the aggregate represented only 0.06% of GDP in 2013. LGUs \nhave been provided, by law, with a very limited set of potential taxes that can be used to \nstrengthen local tax bases. Moreover, these potential revenue sources suffer from inefficient \ndesign and require frequent regulatory changes. While LGUs have been granted borrowing \npowers, there are implicit provisions that restrict their access to credit, including a cumbersome \napproval process and a narrow scope of approved borrowing purposes.  \n ", "3 \n9.  Public financial management systems are inefficient. Efficient PFM provides the \nframework through which public services are delivered effectively and efficiently. However, the \nabsence of a strategic vision has resulted in a piecemeal approach which focused only on \nreforming individual elements of the PFM system. Budget operation systems are outdated and \nprevent the synchronization  of  planning  and  budgeting.  Expenditure targeting  needs  to  be \nimproved.  Regulations  governing  PFM  at  the  LGU  level  need  to  be  aligned  with  national \nexpenditure priorities and institutionalized. New initiatives at the national level which encourage \nand reward enhanced PFM at the LGU level, such as the Assistance to LGU Program (ALGUP) \nand the Performance Challenge Fund (PCF), are not coordinated with local development plans.5 \nKey LGU policies, such as those covering local economic enterprises, the Special Education \nFund, and disaster risk management, do not incorporate the recently established performance-\nbased management systems such as the seal of good local governance (SGLG) system. \n10.  Local  government  accountability  systems  are  underdeveloped.  Performance \nmeasurement systems are critical to ensuring that local budgets are responsive to local needs \nand aligned with national development priorities. However, local constituents do not have the \nmeans to monitor and evaluate, or provide feedback on the budget performance of LGUs. The \nperformance evaluation systems currently in use do not provide useful data to guide investment \ndecisions, do not allow for inter-local comparisons, and are not easily accessible to the public. In \naddition, the number of these performance measurement instruments has multiplied which has \nincreased LGUs compliance costs. Performance mechanisms for LGUs also need to be binding, \nas well as compliant with transparency policies. \n11.  Fiscal  transfers  are  not  equitably  distributed.  The  IRA  is  the  largest  national \ngovernment transfer, representing close to two-thirds of the aggregate income of LGUs in 2014  \n(\u20b1341 billion). The IRA is divided among different LGUs as follows: 23% to provinces, 23% to \ncities,  34% to  municipalities,  and  20% to  barangays. The IRA  share of  each  tier  of  local \ngovernment is then apportioned to individual LGUs within each level based on population \n(50%), land area (25%), and equal sharing (25%). The IRA does not consider the fiscal capacity \nof LGUs, which causes large disparities in expenditure per capita and limits the ability of poorer \nLGUs to deliver a level of basic services comparable with the more well-off LGUs. \n12.  The  government\u2019s  sector  strategy.  The  PDP,  2011\u20132016  identifies  three  primary \nobjectives: (i) promoting inclusive growth and generating employment, (ii) improving governance \nand human development standards, and (iii) achieving macroeconomic and fiscal sustainability. \nThe  Good  Governance  and  Anti-Corruption  Cabinet  Cluster  (GGACC)  coordinates  the \nimplementation  of  the  government\u2019s  initiatives  to  strengthen  public  institutions,  promote \ntransparency,  and  increase  accountability  through  participatory  governance.  Within  this \nframework, the PFM road map provides a comprehensive reform agenda to ensure that the \nnational government is able to maintain fiscal discipline, allocate funds efficiently, and provide \nefficient service delivery. For example, the road map calls for the development of an integrated \nfinancial  management  information  system  that  can  provide  web-based  access  to  LGU \ninformation  in  a common format.  Emphasis  is  also  being  placed  on performance-informed \nbudgeting to strengthen alignment with national priorities, reinforce accountability, and better \nengage civil society. Efforts to promote decentralization and strengthen PFM are expected to \ncontinue under the draft PDP for 2017\u20132022 and will be supported by the LGU PFM reform road \nmap 2016\u20132022, which was adopted in 2015 as part of this program. The road map addresses \nthe gaps identified in the 2007 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment \n(PEFA) through four sequenced reform clusters; linking budget planning to policy priorities, \n                                                \n5 ALGUP has superseded the Bottom-up Budgeting program. \n ", "4 \ndeveloping reliable and predictable budgets, increasing transparency, and holding managers \naccountable. \nADB\u2019s Engagement in PFM Reforms\n2013:Technical  2018\u20132020: Proposed \n2004.

ADB\u2019s experience. ADB has supported local government reforms in the Philippines \nsince 2004. The first programmatic approach focused on decentralization and local government \nfinance  by  institutionalizing  the  timely  and  transparent  release  of  LGU  shares  in  national \ngovernment revenues.6 In addition, the program developed the pillars of a performance-based \nLGU PFM framework, provided LGUs with limited access to credit financing, and strengthened \nthe  ability  of  national  oversight  agencies  to  monitor  LGU  finances.  Building  on  these \naccomplishments, the program (footnote 1) now serves as an umbrella to anchor ADB\u2019s support \nfor  broader  PFM  reform  and  its  expanding  engagement  with  LGUs.  For  example,  the \nEncouraging Investment through Capital Market Reforms Program is providing complementary \nsupport to the Bureau of the Treasury to strengthen debt management, cash flow forecasting, \nand  control  over the government\u2019s  cash  balances.7 The  Expanding  Private  Participation  in \nInfrastructure Program8 provides support to the national government and LGUs to accelerate \nthe development of infrastructure, while the proposed (2016) Enhancing Youth School-to-Work \nTransition  Program  supports  measures  to  improve  employment,  including  labor  market \nactivation programs in LGUs. Continuing support to LGUs is planned through the Enhancing \nRural Enterprise and Rural Employment Program, planned for 2017, and the next generation \nLocal Government Development Program, which is planned for 2018. \n14.  Lessons learned from the experience. A key lesson has been the need to sustain rich \nand  frequent  interagency  coordination.  The  work  of  the  Coordinating  Committee  on \nDecentralization (CCD), which was established with ADB support, and the Working Group on \nDecentralization  of  the  Philippine  Development  Forum  were  instrumental  in  ensuring  the \ncoordination  of  all  reform  initiatives  and  maintaining  a  common  focus  on  performance, \naccountability, and inclusive growth. A second lesson learned is the need to ensure bottom-up \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2007.

This has been particularly true in the review of the \nLGC, among other initiatives. A third lesson was gained from the continuing dissemination of the \nlink between LGU reform and the achievement of the country\u2019s long-term development goals \nwhich enhanced stakeholder participation. In addition, good local governance is instrumental in \nensuring program implementation and, in particular, infrastructure development. \n15.  ADB\u2019s value added to the design and implementation of the program. Through the \nprovision of technical assistance and policy advice, ADB established a framework that improved \nthe administration of real estate and property taxes,9 and supported the completion of a number \nof  policy  reforms  under  the  program.10 Notably,  ADB  provided  the  technical  and  logistical \nresources to complete the government-led review of the fiscal provisions of the LGC. ADB also \nprovided  capacity  development  to  improve  comprehensive  development  planning  and,  in \nparticular, the harmonization of the different planning processes linked to national and local \nprograms (e.g., the ALGUP and the PCF). ADB strengthened the analytical value of reporting \nthrough the implementation of financial management information systems for LGUs (e.g., the \nelectronic statement of receipts and expenditures [eSRE]). Technical assistance was provided \nto assess the impact of national tax incentives on local government revenues and economic \ngrowth, identify new sources of local revenue for LGUs, and develop a financing framework for \nLGU alliances that assists joint service delivery. Finally, ADB encouraged the civil society to \nplay  an  enhanced  role  in  LGUs  by  reengineering  the  local  government  performance \nmeasurement system to align it with the SGLG. \n16.  Development  partner  coordination.  The  program  has  benefited  from  close \ncoordination with the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) through joint missions and \nonsite reviews. AFD provided parallel financing in the amount of $150 million equivalent for \nsubprogram 1 and plans an equivalent amount of support for subprogram 2. In addition, close \ncoordination has been sustained with the European Union-led LGU Public Finance Reform \nProgram through the CCD. Coordination with other development partners (such as the World \nBank, Australia, and Canada) has been assisted by the work of the Philippine Development \nForum working group on decentralization. \n17.  Policy-based loan and budget support. The programmatic approach was selected as \nit leverages government and stakeholder engagement and supports the implementation of a \ncomplex  set  of  policy  initiatives,  including  eventual  amendments  to  the  law,  into  a \ncomprehensive and cohesive medium-term reform plan. The approach is optimized by the \nability to deliver technical assistance from several development partners to national and local \ngovernment agencies. The post-program partnership framework will support a continuing policy \ndialogue between the government and ADB. \n18.  Economic  impact  of  the  program.  Research  indicates  that  decentralization  of \ngovernment expenditure can reduce income inequality, given a sufficiently large government \nexpenditure program, comprehensive decentralization, and most importantly, decentralization \non the revenue side to reduce LGU reliance on the IRA.11 Therefore the program will increase \nthe efficiency of service provision by LGUs through a better allocation of budgetary resources. \nThe economic benefits will be achieved by aligning expenditure assignments across tiers of \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2011.

Impact and Outcome \n19.  The impact, which is aligned with the PDP, 2011\u20132016, will be improved governance \nand human development standards through more efficient service delivery. The outcome will be \nefficient and transparent local government financial management systems developed. There are \nfour major outputs which are aligned with the government\u2019s reform priorities. Subprogram 2 \nincludes 26 policy actions (14 triggers and 12 milestones), which were completed from July \n2013 to May 2016.12 \n \nC.  Outputs \n20.  Output 1: Resource framework for fiscal sustainability developed. LGUs need to \nincrease their own source revenue. As LGUs currently generate tax revenues primarily from \nbusiness and real estate taxes, the government improved the assessment of real estate market \nvalues  and  strengthened  the  capacity  of  the  personnel  that  conduct  tax  assessments.  In \naddition, the government developed proposals to reform property and business taxes, and to \ncreate new tax instruments for LGUs.13 Access to the Bureau for Internal Revenue\u2019s taxpayer \ndatabase  was  increased  and  the  related  reporting  requirements  are  now  an  assessment \ncriterion in the performance standards of local treasurers and assessors. As a result, aggregate \nproperty taxes collected by LGUs increased by 48% between 2010 and 2015. \n \n21.  The government also increased LGU access to credit financing through the deployment \nof new eSRE modules on LGU creditworthiness to the regional offices of the Bureau of Local \nGovernment Finance (BLGF) of the Department of Finance (DOF). The modules allow LGUs to \nestimate their debt borrowing limits and provide a solid technical instrument for the DOF to \nvalidate the borrowing capacity of LGUs. In addition, a dedicated Debt Monitoring Unit has been \ncreated in the BLGF, which is designing and maintaining LGU monitoring procedures, collecting \nconsolidated LGU borrowing data, and issuing regular publications. \n \n22.  Concurrently, the government strengthened its oversight of LGU expenditures. A new \nmodule  under  the  eSRE  provides  a  publicly  available  means  of  monitoring  LGU  capital \nexpenditures  from  the  development  fund.14 In  addition,  reporting  mechanisms  have  been \nincorporated into the ALGUP to capture and monitor the capital expenditure of LGUs, and to \nfacilitate ex post monitoring through the Commission of Audit\u2019s annual audits. Eligibility to \naccess development funds, including the PCF and ALGUP, has been tied to the SGLG to \nincentivize performance-based management in local governments. Expanding on the initial Seal \nof Good Financial Housekeeping, the SGLG validates that LGUs comply with national legal and \npolicy  requirements  in  additional  performance  areas,  including  disaster  preparedness, \ncompetitiveness, and environment protection. \n \n23.  Output 2: Public financial management system to assist efficient local government \nunit  service  delivery  strengthened.  To  provide  much-needed  strategic  guidance  and \ncontinuity, the government approved and implemented its LGU PFM road map and strategy. In \n                                                \n12 Subprogram 2 originally proposed 59 policy actions and sub-actions. All were completed as originally proposed. \nSubsequently, the policy matrix was modified and streamlined to improve its presentation and readability. \n13 These proposals emanated from output 1 and the review of the LGC. \n14 The development fund is defined as 20% of the IRA allocation and is earmarked for capital investment projects. \n ", "7 \naddition, the government updated its budget and planning systems and synchronized project \ndevelopment, planning, investment programming, and budgeting across all levels of government. \nThe  Department  of  Budget  and  Management  revised  the  Budget  Operations  Manual  to \ninstitutionalize performance-informed and participatory budgeting processes at the LGU level. \nThe revised manual covers the preparation of medium-term expenditure frameworks for LGUs, \nand incorporates policy changes to dedicated funds (e.g., the Special Education Fund and the \nLocal Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Fund). The manual also incorporates the \nprovisions of the new manual on local economic enterprises along with enhanced procedures \nfor internal audit. In addition, the government has upgraded financial management information \nsystems and completed a common database of financial information for LGUs. \n \n24.  The ALGUP initiative has been expanded and now encompasses over 1,514 LGUs with \nan aggregate expenditure of \u20b125 billion ($517 million) in 2015 compared with 595 LGUs and  \n\u20b18 billion ($165 million) in 2013. Concurrently, the government has integrated the ALGUP into \nlocal  planning  process  through  synchronized  calendars,  formats,  terminologies,  and  the \ncomposition of consultative bodies. Civil society provides inputs in the identification of projects \nand ensures funds are allocated in an increasingly equitable manner. \n \n25.  Output  3:  Local  governance,  transparency,  and  accountability  systems \nestablished.  A  performance-based,  responsive  PFM  requires  transparency  and  the \nparticipation  of  civil  society.  In  recognition,  the  government  has  improved  accountability \nmechanisms between LGUs and their constituents. The Citizen\u2019s Satisfaction Index, which \ncovered 35 cities in 2013, has been expanded and now covers 140 cities (2015). The index \nallows constituents to evaluate the performance of LGUs in the areas of health, governance and \nresponse, environment management, public works and infrastructure, support to education, \nsocial welfare, tourism promotion, and agricultural support. Full disclosure of the results of the \nindex is required as a binding prerequisite to access national government funds. To further \nexpand and strengthen the participation of civil society, the Department of the Interior and Local \nGovernance (DILG) has redesigned the Local Government Performance Management System \nand, over time, will align it with the SGLG. This will enhance the analytical capacity of the \nsystem  to  assist  planning  and  budget  formulation  by  LGUs,  and  improve  access  of  local \nconstituents to the data and information contained in the system. \n \n26.  To promote an accelerated adoption of the revised performance-based PFM systems, \nthe government has implemented a program to test and evaluate the technical capacity of LGU \ntreasurers. The first assessments have been released. In addition, the DILG upgraded the \nNewly Elected Officials\u2019 training program, and provided training to 560 newly elected officials as \npart of the recent election cycle. Capacity development has also been provided to local planning \nofficers in select regions to improve the preparation of local comprehensive development plans. \nMoreover, the government has improved the implementation of gender and development plans \nfor LGUs by issuing guidelines to incorporate the Magna Carta for Women in LGU budgets and \ninvestment plans, and has deployed a system to monitor implementation.15 This effort has been \nsupported by training programs, delivered at the local level, to help LGUs identify and evaluate \nactivities in local gender and development plans. \n \n27.  Output  4:  Fiscal  framework  for  inclusive  growth  created. Changes to the legal \nframework are required to provide a more equitable system for intergovernmental fiscal relations. \nTo support an eventual revision of the LGC, the government completed the first comprehensive \n                                                \n15 The Magna Carta for Women (Republic Act 9710 dated 28 July 2008) is a comprehensive women's human rights \nlaw that seeks to eliminate discrimination and promote the rights of Filipino women. \n ", "8 \nreview of the LGC in 25 years. The review, which was completed in 2015, was led by national \nand local government agencies, and included the participation of academe, the private sector, \ncivil society, and development partners. The DILG submitted the results of the review to all \nmembers of the GGACC, and to the head of the Oversight Committee on Devolution (i.e., the \nexecutive secretary to the government). Two of the proposals (i.e., the Valuation Act and the \nLGU Income Classification Bill) were filed in the 16th Philippine Congress, and have reached \ndifferent  stages  of  progress.  Moreover,  the  recommendations  for  amendment  of  the  LGC \nobtained from the review have provided a comprehensive medium-term road map for fiscal \ndecentralization that will be available for the next administration. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n28.  The  government  has  requested  a  single-tranche  loan  of  $250  million  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources  to  help  finance  subprogram  2,  which  is  the  second  and  last \nsubprogram of a programmatic approach (footnote 1). The loan will  have a 15-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 3 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of \n0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \nBased on this, the average loan maturity is 12.1 years. The loan size is based on the financing \nneeds of the Philippines, the strength of the policy reform package, and its development impact. \nThe Philippines\u2019 gross financing needs are high. In 2016, with a budget deficit target of 2.7% of \nGDP, the government will need to borrow $6.9 billion, of which an estimated $1.5 billion will be \nsourced through official development assistance. AFD will provide parallel financing in the \namount of $150 million equivalent. \n  \n29.  The government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under \nADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  based  on  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany communication or advice from ADB. The loan proceeds will be used to finance foreign \nexchange of economy-wide imports, excluding ineligible items and imports financed by other \nbilateral  and  multilateral  sources  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n(2015, as amended from time to time). The loan proceeds will be disbursed to the Philippines as \nthe borrower. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n30.  The DOF is the executing agency for the program and is responsible for the overall \nimplementation of both subprograms and the medium-term results framework. CCD served as \nthe  steering  committee for  the  program,  as  it  includes  all  the  implementing  agencies  and \nrelevant stakeholders. CCD led the review of the LGC and submitted the recommendations to \nOversight Committee on Devolution for consideration. The program\u2019s implementing agencies \ninclude the BLGF, the DILG, the DBM, and the National Economic and Development Authority. \nSubprogram 2 was implemented from July 2013 to May 2016. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n31.  The net present value of the potential gains from full implementation of the program is \nestimated to be $2 billion. This estimate assumes  a 10% discount rate, that the program \naccelerated the reforms by 10 years, and that the costs and expenditures grow at a real rate of \n ", "9 \n3% a year. The program\u2019s benefits are derived from three primary sources: increased efficiency \nof  LGU  expenditure,  redistributive  gains  arising  out  of  a  realignment  of  the  IRA  towards \nrelatively poorer LGUs, and gains arising from more targeted and efficient spending programs. \nHowever, the primary benefit arising out of the reforms is clearly due to the increased efficiency \nof LGU service provision. In the aggregate, the direct costs of the program are estimated to total \n$1.4  billion.  This  includes  the  cost  of financing the  ALGUP  initiative,  estimated  at  around  \n$1.1 billion, the PCF and associated funds to the Seal of Good Governance (with an estimated \nbudget of $170 million), and costs related to policy development and administration.16 \n \nB.  Governance \n \n32.  Under the PDP, 2011\u20132016, the government has instituted an aggressive reform agenda \nto create an enabling environment for citizens and the private sector (para. 11). Under this \nagenda, the implementation of the 2011  PFM reform road map has achieved measurable \nresults. The 2014 update of the 2010 PEFA noted that the average scores for three of the six \ndimensions (comprehensiveness and transparency; policy-based budgeting; and accounting, \nrecording,  and  reporting)  have  improved.  The  remaining  areas  of  weakness  (e.g.,  budget \ncredibility, predictability and control in budget execution, and external scrutiny and audit) are \nbeing addressed. Budget credibility has been enhanced through the adoption of performance-\nbased  budgeting  and  efforts  to  ensure  accelerated  budget  execution.  In  addition,  the \ngovernment has strengthened the budget review process and has reduced the number and \nmagnitude of special purpose funds. The recent adoption of a treasury single account will also \nincrease budget credibility by centralizing the collection of government revenues. Transparency \nhas been strengthened through the adoption of the transparency seal. This program requires all \ngovernment agencies to disclose key information, including open-source data sets, through their \nrespective websites. To improve scrutiny and audit, Congress now reviews and approves the \nannual budget and the standards governing public audit have been strengthened.17 \n \n33.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the DOF. GGACC is implementing a comprehensive and results-\nbased anticorruption action plan, drawing on a review of the National Anti-Corruption Plan of \nAction. Various initiatives by various development partners to strengthen the capacity of the \nOffice of the Ombudsman and the justice sector have achieved positive results. The Philippines \nrose  to  95th  place  out  of  175  countries  in  Transparency  International\u2019s  2015  Corruption \nPerception Index, from 134th place out of 178 countries in 2010 when the program commenced. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n34.  The potential beneficiaries of the program will include local constituents, the private \nsector, civil society organizations, and the poor. The program will introduce participatory and \naccountable planning, budgeting, and monitoring systems that allow improved matching of local \nbudgets and local development priorities and preferences. The reforms implemented under the \nprogram will also have a direct impact on poverty reduction by helping prioritize and improve the \ncoordination of pro-poor expenditures. The reforms will also improve service delivery through \nthe  ALGUP  and  PCF  and,  indirectly,  through  savings  obtained  from  more  efficient  PFM \npractices.  Finally,  the  program  will  support  the  creation  of  predictable  and  adequate  local \nrevenue  bases  that  assist  private  entrepreneurship  and  business  development,  as  well  as \nemployment generation. Subprogram 2 is classified as some gender elements and includes \nimprovements to the preparation and monitoring of gender and development plans by LGUs, the \n                                                \n16 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Public Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nprioritization of gender-sensitive expenditures under the ALGUP, and the inclusion of gender \ndimensions in performance-based monitoring systems. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n35.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  subprogram  2  is \nclassified category C for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \nThe assessment of policy actions concludes that no safeguard policies are triggered. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n36.  The program is exposed to broad macroeconomic risks, as well as risks associated with \nPFM and corruption. Overall, risks are medium and well-controlled, and the integrated benefits \nand impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. Macroeconomic risks are low, and ADB is \nactively coordinating with other development partners to mitigate the remaining broad risks by \nsupporting a whole of government approach, which includes this program, to reduce corruption \nand strengthen the entire PFM cycle, including procurement. Contextual or project-specific risks \narise primarily out of the need to assure the continuity of reforms through the government \ntransition.  ADB  has  addressed  these  risks  by  building  a  wide  stakeholder  engagement, \nincluding representatives from the Senate and the House of Representatives, and by providing \nexplicit incentives in the reform program for local government officials. ADB will also provide the \nnew administration with a briefing note to describe the rationale and benefits of the program, as \nwell as the extent of existing stakeholder support. The CCD, which was established with ADB \nsupport, also plays a lead role in ensuring continuing progress. Major risks and mitigating \nmeasures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.18  \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n37.  The government and DOF have assured ADB that implementation of the program shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the loan document. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n38.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based loan would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloan  of  $250,000,000  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for  subprogram  2  of  the  Local \nGovernment Finance and Fiscal Decentralization Reform Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB's London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in \nthe draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n21 November 2016 \n                                                \n18 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact the Program is Aligned With \nThe program is aligned with the Philippine Development Plan, 2011\u20132016a and will improve governance \nand human development standards through more efficient service delivery. \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2017:     \nEfficient and  a.
