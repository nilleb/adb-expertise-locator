INTRODUCTION \n1.  The National Committee for Disaster Management (NCDM), established in 1995, is the \ncountry\u2019s  main  disaster  management  agency  for  facilitating  interministerial  responses  to \nemergency  and  disaster  events.  The  Flood  Damage  Emergency  Reconstruction  Project, \napproved  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  on  27  March  2012  for  $67.18  million \ncommissioned an institutional review and capacity assessment of the NCDM.1 This involved \nreview of the policies, structure, performance, and outputs of the NCDM through individual \ninterviews  with  NCDM  staff,  line  ministries,  development  partners,  and  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs), as well as secondary data and observations of coordination meetings \nover 6 months. The assessment highlights the lack of a solid policy foundation and budgetary \nresources  to  support  disaster  risk  management  (DRM)-related  coordination  functions  in \nCambodia; the weakness of the NCDM\u2019s structure and its lack of capacity to formulate relevant \nlegislation, polices, and strategies; and its inability to translate policies and strategies into \noperational plans and implementation. The NCDM management has recognized the results of \nthe study and has expressed willingness to improve those weaknesses.  \n2.  ADB  has  developed  two  integrated  and  complementary  proposals:  (i)  technical \nassistance (TA) to address DRM issues at the policy level, NCDM Secretariat (NCDMS) level, \nand provincial level; and (ii) a grant project, Community-Based Disaster Risk Reduction, to be \nsubmitted shortly once the funding from the Government of Japan is approved, to complement \nthe planned institutional strengthening efforts to institutionalize community-based disaster risk \nreduction (DRR) and coordination through localized structures at the district and commune \nlevels.  ADB  discussed  the  TA  concept  paper  with  the  government  ministries,  civil  society \norganizations, development partners, and other stakeholders; and reached a consensus on the \nneed to strengthen the disaster management and coordination system. Following a fact-finding \nmission from 17 to 31 December 2013, a memorandum of understanding was signed with the \nsenior minister in charge of the special mission and first vice-president of the NCDM on 8 \nJanuary 2014, agreeing on the TA project\u2019s impact, outcome, outputs, cost, implementation \narrangements, and terms of reference for consulting services.2 The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Cambodia experiences drought and flood incidents that impact a significant portion of its \npoor population every year. In 2009, Typhoon Ketsana affected 11 of 24 provinces and caused \ndamage totaling $39 million. In 2011, Cambodia suffered extensive and prolonged rains which \nresulted in unprecedented floods in 18 provinces. The floods had widespread impacts on public \ninfrastructure  and  many  communities\u2014causing  the  deaths  of  250  people,  $625 million  in \ndamages, and affecting more than 1.5 million people. In 2013, 20 provinces were impacted by \nhuge floods which caused the deaths of 168 people, with an estimated loss of $356 million in \ndamages, affecting about 1.7 million people. As global climate conditions continue to change, \nCambodia will experience increasingly unpredictable flood and drought occurrences that may \noverwhelm the country\u2019s limited capacity and resources. \n4.  Women and men are affected differently by natural disasters as a result of their different \nroles and responsibilities in the family and community. Women are often severely affected by \ndamage and disruption to basic services and community infrastructure because of their family \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2012. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors:  Proposed Loan and \nAdministration of Grant for the Flood Damage Emergency Reconstruction Project in Cambodia. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 10 February 2014. \n ", "2  \nresponsibilities. In addition, during displacements, women and girls are more exposed to sexual \nabuse and violence. \n5.  Many development projects, including any disaster recovery project, will be threatened \nby future, more intense disasters caused by natural hazards if the country\u2019s DRM system \ncontinues to be weak. At the national level, government ministries and stakeholders have only \nmet during emergencies and disasters. The NCDMS and its operational departments have \nlimited capacity to operate effectively. They have not developed comprehensive annual action \nplans  or  operating  plans,  and  do  not  have  adequate  annual  operating  budgets.  At  the \nsubnational level, disaster management committees are responsible for leading DRM efforts but \ndo not have adequate resources. Conditions at the subnational level are more challenging, as it \nis the front line in addressing the direct effects and impacts of emergencies and disaster events. \n6.  The TA will be linked to the ADB-financed Flood Damage Emergency Reconstruction \nProject, with a total budget of $67.18 million, to restore key infrastructure damaged by the 2011 \nfloods in six severely flood-affected provinces.3 To mitigate the impacts of the 2013 floods, ADB \napproved  a  flood  recovery  project  with  an  additional  financing  into  the  Flood  Damage \nEmergency Reconstruction Project with a total budget of $90.6 million. The proposed TA seeks \nto  strengthen  and  sustain  government  institutional  and  technical  capacity  for  DRM.  It  will \ncomplement  the  project  since  its  main  activities  include  (i) reviewing  the  policy  and  legal \nframework to support and strengthen the NCDM\u2019s mandate, keeping in mind the DRM needs of \nthe country; (ii) supporting the NCDMS to develop a long-term plan to build NCDM\u2019s institutional \ncapacity at the national and subnational level to manage disaster risk; and (iii) assessing the \nfeasibility of developing a knowledge base and of training staff to undertake practical risk \nreduction programs targeting at-risk communities. \n7.  Cambodia\u2019s National Strategic Development Plan Update, 2009\u20132013 includes DRR and \nrecognizes  its  correlation  to  poverty. 4  Strengthening  community  resilience  to  disasters \ncontributes to poverty reduction and to a general improvement in the quality of life\u2014the primary \nobjectives of the government\u2019s development efforts. Hazard and vulnerability assessments, \nearly warning systems, emergency response plans, and community preparedness and recovery \nplans enable local communities to address their specific vulnerabilities directly and cope with a \nprimary contributor to poverty in the country. \n8.  The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020;5 the Southeast Asia Department\u2019s Climate \nChange  Implementation  Plan;  and  various  sector  assessments,  strategies,  and road  maps \nprepared as background to the new country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132018. The TA supports \nADB\u2019s Cambodia country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132013, which aims to reduce poverty and \npromote inclusive growth with an integrated approach to rural development, targeting the areas \nwhere most poor reside. At the same time, it will also be consistent with social protection \nmeasures, community-based development, and public sector capacity development. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be improved national capacity to manage disaster risks in Cambodia. \n                                                \n3 Battambang, Banteay Meanchey, Siem Reap, Kampong Thom, Kampong Cham, and Prey Veng. \n4 Government of Cambodia. 2010.

Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020.    \n  Manila. \n ", "  3\nThe target will be a 15% reduction in losses to life and livelihood from the 2013 baseline (5-year \naverage from 2009 to 2013) in the number of households affected by and the economic losses \nincurred from floods. \n10.  The outcome of the TA will be improved policy and institutional capacity for DRM in \nCambodia.  The  target  will  be  (i)  a  development  planning  process  of  at  least  eight  sector \nministries and the NCDMS, factoring in risks from natural hazards and undertaking interventions \nguided by priorities of approved DRM policies and strategies; and (ii) DRR interventions being \nimplemented in six provinces, and an improved coordination mechanism to respond to disaster \nevents. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n11.  The proposed TA seeks to strengthen and sustain government institutional and technical \ncapacity for DRM. There will be four outputs. \n12.  Output 1: Policy environment for effective disaster risk management established \nand strengthened. The policy environment will be strengthened to enable the DRM system to \nfunction effectively. The aim is to ensure the country has a unified strategy for DRM that is \nmainstreamed throughout the different sectors. This will result from activities that promote \ncommon understanding of roles and responsibilities of different line agencies (members of the \nNCDM for a well-coordinated implementation of key actions to reduce disaster and manage the \nresidual risk of disasters such as floods and droughts. Key activities will include (i) drafting, \nconsulting, and finalizing relevant DRM  policies, strategies, and priorities, taking into account \ngender concerns, for approval by the Council of Ministers; (ii) assigning and training DRM focal \npoints from line ministries and working with them to incorporate DRR actions into sector plans; \n(iii) organizing high-level dialogue with line ministries to incorporate DRR activities into the \nmidterm review of the National Strategic Development Plan (2014\u20132018) to provide strategic \ndirection for all DRR stakeholders; and (iv) preparing and adopting support policies such as \nstandard operating procedures on DRM and national guidelines for integrating DRR into the \nsubnational planning process. \n13.  Output  2: Institutional  capacity  of  disaster  risk  management  structure  at  the \nnational level improved. This output will build the DRM technical capacity and gender analysis \nskill of the NCDMS staff and sector focal points to perform DRM functions effectively through a \nseries of capacity-building activities on technical aspects of DRM. Identification of training and \ncapacity-building needs will begin with the national workshops under output 1, supplemented by \nneeds analysis and resource identification and mobilization by development agencies. A pool of \ntrainers specialized in gender and DRM will be formed, with at least 30% women\u2019s participation, \nfrom the NCDMS and sector focal points. Activities will include (i) needs assessment and \ntraining of NCDM staff and sector focal points; (ii) review of the roles and functions of NCDMS \nstaff, assessing the possibility for establishing policy and planning and disaster management \ninformation system units; (iii) developing standardized tools, guidelines, and protocols; and \n(iv) establishing a training pool for all technical aspects of DRM and gender specialization with \nqualified NCDM and other line ministry staff.   \n14.  Output  3: Institutional  capacity  of  disaster  risk  management  structure  at  the \nprovincial  level  improved.  The  capacity  for  DRM  at  the  subnational  level  will  be  much \nimproved,  with  fully  staffed  and  functional  provincial  committees  for  disaster  management \n(PCDMs)  with  communication  lines  to  provincial  departments  (PCDM\u2019s  members).  The \ncapacity-building priorities and training curriculum developed under output 2 will be rolled out to \nthe subnational level under this output by the pool of trainers established under output 2. In \n ", "4  \naddition, PCDMs and provincial departments will jointly develop provincial contingency plans \nand coordinate all related actions through provincial disaster response teams. 6 PCDMs will \nacquire  the  capacity  to  identify  risk;  analyze  gender  issues;  prioritize  and  implement  risk \nreduction  measures;  lead  flood  coordination  meetings,  and  joint  damage  and  needs \nassessments; produce situation reports during disasters; and regularly collect and manage \ndisaster-related  information.  Key  activities  include  (i) establishment  of  the  PCDMs,  (ii) \ncontingency planning formation and training of provincial disaster response teams on gender-\ninclusive DRM, (iii) establishment and capacity building for a subnational disaster management \ninformation system, and (iv) contingency planning and regular coordination of preparedness \nand disaster response activities. \n15.  Output 4: Effective technical assistance management. This component ensures that \nthe project will be completed in a timely manner within the specified budget, with best gender \nresponsive practices and innovative approaches documented for replication and rolled out to \nother provinces. It involves (i) timely assigning the counterpart staff for the implementation of \nthe TA activities with women staff represent at least 30% of the total counterpart staff, (ii) \nreviewing  the  availability  of  information  and  identifying  the  venues  for  documentation  and \ndissemination, (iii) raising public awareness on DRM, (iv) collecting and sharing information on \ntraditional  and/or  indigenous  DRR  practices,  and  (v) monitoring  and  reporting  of  progress \nregarding national DRM priorities. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,353,000, of which $2,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart \nsupport in the form of counterpart staff, office space, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 2 years from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2016. The \nNCDMS will be the executing agency for the TA. It will assign 12 qualified staff, with women \nstaff specifically encouraged, for the positions and tasks specified in the terms of reference \n(Supplementary Appendix A). The departments of the NCDMS and the PCDMs from the six \npriority provinces will serve as implementing agencies. The selected NCDM member agencies7 \nwill assign focal points for DRM. With the focal points and NCDM assistance, NCDM member \nagencies will take the necessary actions to incorporate DRR into their policies, strategies, and \nannual sector plans.  \n18.  A TA steering committee\u2014comprising senior representatives of the Ministry of Interior; \nMinistry of Planning; Ministry of Economy and Finance; Ministry of Environment; Ministry of \nWater Resources and Meteorology; Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries; and the \nNational Committee for Sub-National Democratic Development Secretariat\u2014will be established \nwithin 3 months after the TA becomes effective. An NCDM senior official will chair the steering \n                                                \n6  The National Contingency Plan, developed by the NCDM and approved by the Prime Minister in 2012, is the \nprimary strategy aimed at reducing the negative impacts of major disasters (primarily floods and droughts) by \ndeveloping standard operating procedures for emergency scenarios. This is a living document, with scenarios and \nprocedures updated at least annually, to reflect actual occurrence. Each target province will have a similar exercise \ninvolving provincial departments. \n7 The selected NCDM members include the following: Ministry of Interior; Ministry of Planning; Ministry of Economy \nand Finance; Ministry of Environment; Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology; Ministry of Agriculture, \nForestry and Fisheries; Ministry of Rural Development; Ministry of Women Affairs; and the National Committee for \nSub-National Democratic Development Secretariat \n ", "  5\ncommittee meetings on a quarterly basis to resolve policy issues and provide project direction. \nBased on needs, representatives from development partners and NGOs will be invited to the \nmeetings. This steering committee will also guide the proposed grant for the Community-Based \nDisaster Risk Reduction Project to ensure good coordination between the projects. \n19.  The TA will require an estimated 20 person-months of international and 230 person-\nmonths of national consultant inputs, to be engaged through a consulting firm or NGO in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime).  The  quality  and  cost-based  selection  method  (80:20)  and  full  technical  proposal \nprocedures will be followed for selection of the consulting firm. ADB will recruit the consultant \nfirm or NGO, and advance action will be applied. \n20.  Consulting services contracts will only include consultant-related expenses as indicated \nin  the  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan  (Appendix  2).  Expenses  related  to  equipment, \nworkshops, training and conferences, administrative support, surveys and special studies, and \nknowledge products will be managed by the NCDMS; and an advance payment facility will be \nestablished. The facility will be established at a bank endorsed by the Ministry of Economy and \nFinance and acceptable to ADB, and its ceiling and the amount of the initial advance will be \nbased on estimated expenditures for the first 6 months or 10% of the budget to be managed by \nthe NCDMS, whichever is lower. The advance payment facility will be established, managed, \nreplenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time) and arrangements agreed upon between the \ngovernment and ADB. Procurement and disbursement will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). \n21.  With support from the consultants, the NCDMS will submit quarterly progress reports to \nADB. Progress will be monitored against the intended outcome and outputs in the design and \nmonitoring framework (Appendix 1). In line with output 4, the results will be disseminated \nthrough conferences, workshops, and web portals starting in September 2014. The NCDMS will \nmonitor project progress against the project implementation schedule, and will inform ADB of \nany significant deviations. Within 3 months of completion, the NCDMS will submit to ADB a TA \ncompletion report. The form and content of the reports will be agreed with ADB during the TA \ninception mission. \nIV.
