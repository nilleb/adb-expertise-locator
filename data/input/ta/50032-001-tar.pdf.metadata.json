INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the 2015 country program mission, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide capacity development \ntechnical assistance (TA) to the Ministry of Finance (MOF) for Capacity Building on Operational \nKnowledge. ADB included the proposed TA in the country operations business plan, 2016\u20132018 \nfor the PRC.1 ADB approved the TA concept paper on 16 June 2016 and a fact-finding mission \nwas fielded on 20 June 2016. The mission reached agreement with the government on the TA\u2019s \nimpact, outcome, outputs, terms of reference for consultants, cost estimates, financing plan, and \nimplementation arrangements. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Upper-middle-income  countries  often  face  a  dilemma  on  how  to  transition  from  an \nexisting growth model when the very preconditions, capacities, and modern institutions needed \nto do so are nascent. Capacity building and operational knowledge (i.e., knowledge from, and \nused  in,  managing  and  undertaking  loan  and  technical  assistance  activities  funded  by \nmultilateral development banks) can make an important contribution to this transition process. \n  \n3.  As  a  leading  upper-middle-income  country,  the  PRC  is  now  entering  a  period  of \neconomic transition and reform. The government has recognized that its operational capacities \nand knowledge resources\u2014of new institutions, mechanisms, processes, pilots, lessons, and \nplatforms for dialogue\u2014will be as important as its financial resources in stimulating innovation, \nmaintaining  a  reform  mindset,  making  reform  choices,  and  avoiding  reform  inertia.  This \nrecognition is reflected in the PRC\u2019s 13th Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020, which includes a package \nof comprehensive and top-down reform strategies to systemically support reform needs. The \nplan calls for strengthening the government\u2019s capacity and knowledge structure to create an \ninstitutional framework that can promote the plan\u2019s goals for greater innovation, coordination, \nenvironmental sustainability, and inclusive development. 3 \n \n4.  This  emphasis  on  building  operational  capacity,  knowledge,  and  an  institutional \nframework is also reflected in the PRC\u2019s drive to strengthen its think tanks to meet upper-\nmiddle-income  country  needs.  For  instance,  the  government  has  called  for  improved \ncooperation  between  agencies  and  think  tanks  to  create  (i)  interactive  information-sharing \nplatforms; (ii) open, scientific, standardized, and transparent project mechanisms; (iii) long-term \ntracking research; (iv) improved policy analysis and tools; and (v) quality, innovative evaluation \nmethods that focus on operations to increase the relevance and application of project results.4 \n \n5.  However, actual reforms and the plan\u2019s implementation will mainly occur at the local \nlevel,  where  gaps  exist  between  national  and  local  government  operational  capacities, \nresources, incentives, tools, and information. ADB\u2019s experience has shown that some local \ngovernments and project executing and implementing agencies in poorer regions may lack the \ncapacity to implement projects and pilots needed to address reform needs and create locally \nappropriate responses. For example, there were 412 project implementing agencies for ADB\u2019s \n79 ongoing sovereign lending loans in 2015. Of these, one-quarter (102) were located at the \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2016. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2016\u20132018.

Beijing. \n ", "2  \nmunicipal level and nearly two-thirds (255) at the county and township level. These agencies \nhave little or no experience in working with international financial institutions. Consequently, \ntheir very basis for building innovative development solutions through projects needs to be \nstrengthened through well-targeted capacity building and training. More practical courses are \nneeded  for  project  management  officers  and  implementation  agencies,  including  project \nplanning, financial management, procurement, and contract management. This process cannot \nbe a one-off activity. New project executing and implementing agencies are increasing and staff \nturnover is inevitable, particularly after capacities have been strengthened and program results \nbecome evident. Even more importantly, a well-resourced and systematic master training plan is \nrequired to tailor these capacity building processes and sustain their outcomes over the longer \nterm. Such a master plan would also help to consolidate, and derive greater benefit from, \ncurrently fragmented ADB capacity development resources. \n    \n6.  Such  improvements  in  local  operational  capacity  and  knowledge  also  need  to  be \nmatched  and  better  supported  with  strong  national  executing  agency  capacities  to  create, \nmanage, use, and share operational knowledge, including at the local level. This is consistent \nwith  the  PRC\u2013ADB  Country  Knowledge  Plan,  2016\u20132018,  which  sets  out  a  process  for \nknowledge creation, management, and use that is suited to upper-middle-income countries.5 \n \n7.  However, the Country Knowledge Plan, 2016\u20132018 also notes various knowledge areas \nthat require strengthening. These include the following: \n(i)  Sharpen processes. Processes for identifying TA projects and project clusters \nneed  to  be  sharpened  to  yield  timely,  relevant,  and  quality  policy \nrecommendations. This would require strengthening the TA proposal format and \nTA  identification  process; better mining  past TA development experience for \nrelevance to new reform opportunities and challenges; and enhancing executing \nagency capacity for knowledge storage, synthesis, and sharing. \n(ii)  Strengthen  use  of  ADB-wide  expertise.  This is  necessary  to  identify  and \nrespond  to  urgent  but  unplanned  PRC  knowledge  needs  during  its  critical \neconomic transition and reform period. This would involve periodic ADB\u2013MOF \nmeetings  and  greater  interaction  with  PRC-based  think  tanks;  government \nplanning groups; and private sector, donor, and social organizations to identify \nand provide briefings on timely topics.   \n(iii)  Increase executing agency communicating power. This is essential to better \nconvey operational knowledge to domestic knowledge users. This would require \ncapacity building in policy brief preparation, case writing, and message making. \nThe creation of well-crafted PRC operational knowledge cases from TA projects \nis a basis for increased sharing of PRC development experiences abroad. \n \n8.  Some capacity building pilot activities have already been undertaken. For example, the \nMOF and ADB piloted engagement of renowned PRC think tanks for third-party TA project \nreview and shortlisting in preparation for the 2015 ADB\u2013PRC country programming mission. \nRenewed efforts have also started to support timely dialogues in response to the pressing \nneeds of PRC government agencies and think tanks. However, this work is still incipient or \nintermittent. More needs to be done to systematically strengthen executing and implementing \nagency capacities, and country ownership of operational knowledge processes and products. \nThis TA responds to these needs through two targeted components that build government \ncapacity to (i) design, select and implement TA and loan projects (Component 1); and (ii) better \ncollect, store and share that operational knowledge (Component 2).  \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2016. Country Partnership Strategy: People\u2019s Republic of China,2016\u20132020. Manila. \n ", "  3\n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  impacts  will  be  (i)  stronger  government  agency  capacities  and  institutional \nknowledge; and (ii) increased sharing of information between agencies and think tanks, policy \nanalysis, and tools and results to support the implementation of the 13th Five-Year Plan, 2016\u2013\n2020. The outcome will be stronger government agency capacities to implement ADB-financed \nprojects and to create, use, manage, and share operational knowledge.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA  will undertake training  needs  assessment and training,  data collection  and \ndatabase development, policy analysis, and the design of management processes to achieve \nfour outputs: (i) capacity development and knowledge management training programs for key \ngovernment executing and implementing agencies delivered, (ii) bilingual capacity building and \noperational knowledge databases created and updated, (iii) analytical reports and policy briefs \nsubmitted to the government and findings shared, and (iv) a process for regular third-party think \ntank engagement in the TA cycle developed.  \n \n11.  Output 1: Capacity development and knowledge management training programs \nfor key government executing and implementing agencies delivered. This will involve a \ntraining needs assessment of local executing and implementing agency staff responsible for \nmanaging and implementing ADB-financed loan or investment projects. A consolidated and \nphased master capacity building plan will be prepared, with individual training plans, together \nwith project management training course materials. Pilot training workshops will be conducted to \npre-test the training course for project management and, based on feedback from the pilot \ntraining, the project management course will be further revised and strengthened to enhance \ntraining effectiveness and help create new operational knowledge. A second phase of the \nmaster training plan will develop additional courses for a broader range of groups and will be \nfunded under a follow-on TA project. National activities would involve strengthening the capacity \nof  selected  executing  and  implementing  agency  staff  to  document,  manage,  and  share \nknowledge through training and mentoring in case writing, policy brief preparation, message \nmaking,  and  knowledge  management.  Some  international  trainers  will  be  staff  of  ADB\u2019s \nKnowledge Sharing and Services Center or the center\u2019s hired consultants. \n \n12.  Output  2:  Bilingual  capacity  building  and  operational  knowledge  databases \ncreated and updated. Two ADB\u2013MOF operational knowledge databases will be created to (i) \ntrack progress of local executing and implementing agency staff responsible for managing and \nimplementing ADB-financed loan or investment projects; and (ii) develop synopses of existing \nADB TA projects for uploading to the MOF and ADB websites to improve future project design, \nknowledge work, and institutional memory. \n \n13.  Output 3: Analytical reports and policy briefs submitted to the government and \nfindings  shared.  The  project  will  assist  the  MOF  to  document  TA  synopses  and  other \nknowledge  outputs  in  a  new,  annual  MOF  report  and  on  the  MOF  website  to  strengthen \noperational knowledge sharing among project stakeholders. Policy briefings or briefs will be \nprepared to provide timely knowledge on urgent PRC reform needs and for national\u2013provincial \nlevel and cross-province learning exchanges to report and share operational knowledge. \n \n ", "4  \n14.  Output  4:  Process  for  regular  third-party  think  tank  engagement  in  technical \nassistance  cycle  developed.  The  TA  will  assist  the  MOF  to  develop  a  process  for  the \nengagement of PRC think tanks in a joint TA project proposal shortlisting, evaluation, and \nselected case development. \n \n15.  The key risks in developing the outputs and expected outcome are (i) unanticipated \ngovernment restructuring or downsizing of executing and implementing agencies that disperses \ntrained staff and TA-created training resources; and (ii) an unanticipated natural disaster or \nsocioeconomic shock that causes the executing and implementing agencies to reorient their \nefforts, disrupting the provision of training programs and sequencing of TA activities. The TA will \nendeavor to minimize risks by (i) tracking the related policy environment, and (ii) routinely \ndisseminating interim TA products, findings, and updates to key stakeholders through the MOF \nand ADB websites and quarterly ADB\u2013MOF meetings. Data sharing and access entitlements \nwill be discussed and documented at the commencement of relevant activities. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $880,000, of which $800,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). This will be equally \ndivided between TA component 1 (covering outputs 1 and 2) and TA component 2 (primarily \ncovering  outputs  3\u20134).  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of \ncounterpart staff; office space for consultation meetings; office supplies; relevant data and \ninformation;  travel  costs  and  per  diems for  MOF  counterpart  staff,  and  national  and  local \ngovernment officials to visit study sites; and other in-kind contributions. The MOF will designate \na TA focal point and alternate focal point to review reports and coordinate activities and in-kind \ncontributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The TA will be implemented from August 2016 to July 2018. The MOF will be the \nexecuting  agency.  ADB\u2019s  resident  mission in  the  PRC  will  administer  the TA,  and  ADB\u2019s \nKnowledge  Sharing  and  Services  Center  will  contribute  to  the  oversee  and  monitor  the \nperformance of any international experts that it supports. The TA has two components, each \nwith an MOF division as its implementing agency:  \n(i)  Component  1:  Capacity  building  program  for  executing/implementing \nagencies  (phase  1).  The  MOF\u2019s IFI Division II, Department  of International \nEconomic and Financial Management will be the implementing agency of this \ncomponent. A joint working group will be established, comprising the director of \nMOF IFI Division II, the portfolio management unit head of the PRC Resident \nMission, and the TA deputy team leader. A coordinator will be recruited for the \njoint working group to sit in the MOF and provide day-to-day coordination for \nimplementation of this component.  \n(ii)  Component  2:  Operational  knowledge  activities.  The  MOF\u2019s  Knowledge \nCooperation and TA Division will be the implementing agency for this component. \nADB and the MOF will hold quarterly and ad hoc TA coordination meetings to \nreview and update component 2 implementation status; endorse cost estimates \napproved by the PRC Resident Mission country director; and discuss emerging \nneeds and opportunities for support under the TA, together with proposed work \nplans. All agreements reached by the MOF and ADB during the meetings will be \ndocumented and the activities updated accordingly.  \n \n ", "  5\n18.  In dialogue with the MOF, ADB will recruit individual national experts to provide inputs as \nconsultants and to consider lump-sum payments and/or output-based contracts in line with the \nStrategy  2020  Midterm  Review  Action  Plan.6 Consultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime).  Proceeds  of the  TA  will  be  disbursed in  accordance  with  the  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). A total of 69 person-months of \nnational consulting services from five national consultants, two think tanks, and a consulting firm \nwill be required in accordance with ADB\u2019s procedures for recruitment. \n \n19.  To implement component 1 (phase 1) activities for local executing and/ or implementing \nagency capacity building, a total of 42 person-months of national consultant inputs are required, \ncomprising a coordinator (12 person-months), a capacity development and training specialist (4 \nperson-months), and two project management specialists (total 12 person-months). In addition, \na database development consulting firm (14 person-months) will be recruited to develop the \nparticipant database and to monitor the implementation of individual training plans. The TA will \nalso cover three pilot training workshops on the project management course for about 120 staff \nof the executing and or implementing agencies. \n \n20.  To implement component 2, 27 person-months of individual national consultant inputs \nare required from a knowledge management coordinator (12 person-months). In addition, two \nthink tanks will be recruited for third-party TA shortlisting, selected evaluation, and case studies \nin  2017  (3  person-months);  and  for  TA  synopsis  preparation  and  training  in  policy  brief \npreparation (12 person-months). The outline terms of reference for consultants is in Appendix 3. \n \n21.  The TA will have project-specific indicators and targets, including timely implementation, \nprogress  reporting,  and  periodic  deliverables.  Measurement  of  participant  learning  will  be \nundertaken through surveys at training completion. Trainee progress will be monitored by the \nrelevant TA consultants in accordance with their terms of reference. Post-workshop application \nof knowledge and skills in the workplace will be monitored and evident from the creation of \ntraining-related knowledge products and the updating of a database. The MOF and ADB will \nhold quarterly TA coordination meetings with each component\u2019s implementing agency to identify, \ntrack, and update TA activities and overall TA progress against milestones, and to oversee the \ndelivery of timely TA outputs and effective dissemination. As a result, the MOF\u2019s capacity for \noverall TA implementation and quality control will be strengthened under this TA. A concluding \nquarterly meeting will include self-evaluations by participants. The TA will also support selected \nTA activity monitoring and evaluation by the PRC third-party think tank(s). \n \n22.  Good  practices  and  lessons  will  be  shared  widely  through  (i)  bilingual  operational \nknowledge products maintained on the executing agency website and shared through TA-\nsupported and other executing agency training and (ii) an executing agency annual report.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Capacity  Building  on  Operational \nKnowledge, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n                                                \n6 ADB. 2014.
