INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This knowledge and support regional technical assistance (TA) will help the Association \nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Capital Markets Forum (ACMF) implement the ACMF Action \nPlan 2016\u20132020 as approved by the ASEAN finance ministers in 2016.1 The 5-year action plan \naims to have an interconnected, inclusive, and resilient ASEAN capital market. The TA will focus \non (i) promoting ASEAN asset classes and investor participation, (ii) strengthening regulatory \ncohesiveness and capacities of regulators, and (iii) deepening engagement with the private sector \nand capital market stakeholders. The TA combines capacity building of regulators, policy advice, \nand research related to ACMF initiatives. \n \n2.  The TA is prepared based on a request made by the ACMF chair in February 2019 and is \nincluded  in  the  country  operations  business  plan  for  Indonesia,  2020\u20132022  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB).2 It is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and prioritizes fostering \nregional cooperation and integration, particularly through strengthening capital markets for macro \nfiscal stability, adopting international capital market standards, and strengthening cooperation in \nthe finance sector.3 The TA promotes financial cooperation and integration by supporting the \nACMF as the key focal point for integrating ASEAN capital markets, including developing and \nimplementing regional standards on green bonds and corporate governance. The TA will also \ninform  and  contribute to  country-level  support  for  finance  sector  development  programs  in \nCambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar, the Philippines, and Viet Nam.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Capital market development and regional integration are interrelated. Capital market \ndevelopment contributes to economic growth by: (i) pooling and mobilizing savings for investment;  \n(ii) implementing international best practices in corporate governance, thus helping firms allocate \nand use resources more efficiently; (iii) diversifying and managing risk; (iv) bridging the global \ninfrastructure gap; and (v) crowding in private sector finance. Regional integration also increases \neconomic growth and reduces poverty and inequality. Capital market development provides the \nframework to attract investments, while integration removes barriers to efficient capital movement \nand cross-border investments. \n \n4.  The levels of capital market development across Southeast Asia vary significantly. More \ndeveloped markets like Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand have more than 700 companies listed \non their exchanges and an average monthly trading volume between $10 billion and $23 billion. \nOn the other hand, capital markets in Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR), and \nMyanmar each have fewer than 10 listed companies and low levels of liquidity. The more \ndeveloped capital markets participate in regional integration frameworks and are linked through \ncommon standards, enabling their market participants to offer products and services across \nborders. However, the others face capacity constraints and are unable to participate in regional \nintegration initiatives. Thus, integration of ASEAN capital markets is limited to the more developed \ncountries, and the benefits of integration are yet to be reaped by all. This discrepancy slows the \npace of integration because countries that do not benefit naturally chose not to participate in \nregional integration initiatives, thus perpetuating the cycle. ASEAN capital market regulators \n \n1  The ACMF was established in 2004 to develop a deep, liquid, and integrated regional capital market to meet the \nobjectives of the ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint 2015. \n2  ADB. 2019. Country Operations Business Plan: Indonesia, 2020\u20132022. Manila. \n3  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila.  \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 20 September 2019. \n ", "2 \nthrough the ACMF need to continue to strengthen their collaboration and to provide technical and \nknowledge support to less-developed markets to encourage ASEAN investors and issuers to look \nto ASEAN as the market of choice. ASEAN capital markets face three major constraints to \nintegration: (i) insufficient adoption and implementation of ASEAN and international standards;  \n(ii)  inadequate  capacities  of  regulators;  and  (iii)  lack  of  support  and  buy-in  from  relevant \nstakeholders in the domestic markets. \n \n5.  Insufficient adoption and implementation of ASEAN and international standards. \nThese standards include the ASEAN Green Bond Standards, the ASEAN Corporate Governance \nScorecard (ACGS), and the Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Consultation \nand Cooperation and the Exchange of Information of the International Organization of Securities \nCommissions  (IOSCO).  The  inability  to  adopt  and  implement  these  standards  lowers  the \ncredibility of ASEAN capital markets and may deter long-term investments. Green finance offers \nexamples of limited implementation: although the ASEAN Green Bond Standards was launched \nin 2017, issuances were limited to corporations in Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and \nThailand.5 Further,  publicly  listed  companies  in  ASEAN  need  to  continue  improving  their \ncorporate governance practices based on the ACGS, which may require revising regulations on \ncorporate governance. Finally, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and the Philippines have not \nsigned the IOSCO Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Consultation and \nCooperation and the Exchange of Information. Thus, there is a need to review the respective \nlegislations in these countries to adopt international capital market standards as a prerequisite to \nenable  them  to  participate  in  ASEAN  integration  initiatives  such  as  the  ASEAN  collective \ninvestment scheme. These constraints are inevitable because of the varying levels of capital \nmarket development in the region and show that capital market development directly affects \nregional integration.  \n \n6.  Inadequate capacities of regulators. Regulatory capacity is low in Cambodia, Lao PDR, \nMyanmar, and to a lesser extent, the Philippines and Viet Nam. Capacity-building programs that \nare implemented without ACMF coordination often lack sequencing and are implemented on an \nad hoc basis. Inadequate capacity has limited the ability of the regulators of these capital markets \nto participate in ACMF regional integration initiatives. For example, Malaysia, Singapore, and \nThailand are the only countries to participate in the ASEAN disclosure standards, expedited \nreview framework, and collective investment scheme framework. The other regulators do not have \nthe capacity to participate. Moreover, more advanced ASEAN jurisdictions cannot rely on the \nreview process of the less-advanced jurisdictions to allow products from these countries to be \nsold in their countries. There is also insufficient understanding and information sharing on newly \nemerging  areas  such  as  financial  technology  and  green  and  sustainable  financing  for \ninfrastructure  investment.  Structured  and  sequenced  capacity  building,  especially  for  the \nregulators of the newly developing capital markets, is required to widen participation in ACMF \nintegration initiatives. \n \n7.  Lack of support and buy-in from relevant stakeholders in the domestic markets. \nRegional integration requires support from domestic financial intermediaries. Any agreement or \nframework signed on by the regulators will only be successfully implemented if the domestic \nprivate sector participates in them. However, the private sector is not always aware of the \ninitiatives being discussed at the regional level and often fear that foreign financial intermediaries \nwill take over their domestic business as a result of regional integration. \n \n5  The full list of ASEAN green bond standards (AGBS) issuance can be accessed at https://www.theacmf.org/ \nimages/downloads/pdf/Attachment_2-List_of_ASEAN_Green_Social_Sustainability_Bonds(190719).pdf.  \n ", "3 \n8.  Lessons learned. The TA design incorporates three lessons from the implementation of \nTA projects supporting the ACMF. First, regular consultation sessions with the private sector are \ncrucial to successfully implement regional integration initiatives. The domestic private sector will \nbe supportive and make regional initiatives successful only if it understands how it can benefit \nfrom such initiatives. Second, regional integration requires deliberate consensus building to align \nthe interests of the regulators at different levels of capital market development. This must be \ncomplemented with capacity building for regulators of newly developing capital markets. Third, \nADB\u2019s support for the ACMF should be synchronized with other regional initiatives\u2014such as the \nAsian  Bond  Markets  Initiative  (ABMI),  the  ASEAN  Working  Committee  on  Capital  Market \nDevelopment,  and  the  Asia\u2013Pacific  Economic  Cooperation  Financial  Regulators  Training \nInitiative\u2014on  areas  such  as  local  currency  bond  market  development,  green  bonds  for \ninfrastructure financing, and capacity-building activities.6 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: interconnected, inclusive, and resilient ASEAN \ncapital market achieved.7 The TA will have the following outcome: number of cross-border capital \nmarket activities in ASEAN countries increased.8 The outcome will be achieved through the three \noutputs detailed below, which address the constraints identified in paras. 5\u20137. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: ASEAN asset classes and investor participation promoted. This output will \nsupport three key initiatives. First, anchoring the effort on green, social, and sustainable bond \nstandards, the ACMF has committed to the ASEAN finance ministers to deliver an ASEAN \nsustainability road map by the first quarter of 2020. The ACMF members have prepared the \nguiding principles and outline the road map. The TA will support drafting of the road map so that \nit is inclusive of all ACMF members at different levels of capital market development and relevant \nto the private sector. Second, the TA will focus on implementing ASEAN standards for bonds, \nincluding support for industry engagement (foreign and domestic) to increase bond issuances \nunder the ASEAN green bond, social bond, and sustainable bond standards. The TA also \nproposes to partner with the Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI) to analyze and compile green project \npipelines as developed by authorities in ACMF member countries, culminating in the publication \nof the ASEAN Green Infrastructure Investment Opportunities report.9 This engagement will use \nsingle-source selection because only CBI has the experience and reputation for drafting such a \nreport and similar reports prepared by CBI are considered as authoritative by international issuers \nand investors.10 Third, the TA will continue supporting the implementation of the ACGS. While the \nannual assessment is self-funded by ACMF members, the TA will focus on mainstreaming and \nfinalizing the methodology for the validation exercise by independent corporate governance \n \n6  Green bond-related activities are part of task force 1 of ABMI. This TA will support ASEAN securities regulators to \ndevelop and promote AGBS, while the ABMI TA that is being processed will focus on helping issuers issue green \nbonds under AGBS, including advisory services, grants to partially offset external review fees, and strengthen \ncapacity of local service providers such as rating agencies. \n7  ACMF. 2016. ACMF Action Plan 2016\u20132020. Kuala Lumpur. \n8  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n9  The work with the CBI in identifying green pipeline complements the ASEAN Green Catalytic Finance Facility that \nprovides support for national project development facilities, among others. \n10 A similar report undertaken for Australia can be accessed at https://www.climatebonds.net/resources/reports/green-\ninfrastructure-investment-opportunities-australia-2019. \n \n ", "4 \nexperts. In addition, the TA will also support a joint diagnostic with domestic ranking bodies and \nthe  IESE  Business  School  on  connecting  well-governed  publicly  listed  companies  with \ninternational investors to promote ASEAN as an asset class and promote cross-border listings.11 \nFinally, the TA will support expanding ACGS to cover environmental, social, and governance \ndimensions, and explore the interlinkages with existing ratings and indexes in these areas.  \n \n11.  Output 2: Regulatory capacity and regulatory cohesiveness strengthened. This \noutput will focus on two ACMF initiatives. First, the TA will support programs to build the capacity \nof securities regulators under the ACMF Market Development Program through workshops and \nsecondment programs. The TA will prioritize regulators of newly developing capital markets \n(Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar) so that they can participate in the ACMF\u2019s regional \ninitiatives. Capacity-building areas range from basics of capital market regulation and supervision \nto newer areas such as green bonds and financial technology to help address the constraint \ndiscussed in para. 6. The Thai authorities also requested capacity building of domestic agencies \nto develop verification processes for green bond issuances. Second, regulators from Lao PDR \nand the Philippines requested assistance with their respective IOSCO processes. The IOSCO \ndecision-making body pre-approved the draft revision of the securities regulation in the Philippines. \nThe challenge is to get the draft regulation through congressional deliberation, which requires \nsupport for legal review, advocacy, and clarification of issues raised. \n \n12.  Output 3: Stakeholder interaction, cooperation, and coordination deepened. The \nthird output will support three initiatives. First, the TA will help the ACMF engage with external \nstakeholders  to  communicate  its  initiatives  and  achievements  more  strategically,  including \nimproving the ACMF website and exploring ways to integrate it with the website of the ASEAN \nSecretariat. The TA will support engagement of the local private sector through roundtable \ndiscussions to demonstrate the benefit of ACMF initiatives. Second, the TA will provide partial \nsupport for the annual ACMF\u2013ADB conferences. The Viet Nam State Securities Commission has \nconfirmed their interest in hosting an international conference when they assume the position of \nchair of the ACMF in 2020. These conferences also provide visibility to ADB\u2019s support for ACMF \nand ASEAN regional integration. Third, the TA will support the ACMF\u2019s drafting of the ACMF \nAction Plan 2021\u20132025 and engagement with the private sector to test its relevance. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nInvestment Climate Facilitation Fund under the Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing \nPartnership Facility and administered by ADB.12 The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix \n2. The government (regulators) will provide counterpart support in the form of staff time and \nhosting of ACMF meetings. The annual ACMF\u2013ADB conferences will be partially funded by the \nregulators. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB will administer the TA. The Southeast Asia Department will: (i) select, supervise, and \nevaluate consultants; (ii) organize workshops; and (iii) provide staff to act as the resource persons \nin the workshop. Consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines \n \n11 In the ACMF meeting on March 2019, the ACMF approved the proposal for a joint diagnostic between ADB, corporate \ngovernance experts in the region, and the IESE Business School. \n12 The Investment Climate Facilitation Fund was established by the Government of Japan. \n \n ", "5 \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). 13 If ADB staff act as resource \npersons, the TA will cover only their travel costs.14 The implementation arrangements are \nsummarized in the table. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  December 2019\u2013December 2021 \nExecuting agency  ADB will be the executing agency.

ADB will engage the consultants following the ADB Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions \nand/or staff instructions.15  \n \n16.  Social media and websites. The TA will support integrating the ACMF website into the \nASEAN Secretariat portal. This will bring sustainability to the website because the ASEAN \nSecretariat can continue hosting and maintaining the website after the TA completion date. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  administering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of \n$1,500,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the Investment Climate Facilitation Fund under the \nRegional  Cooperation  and  Integration  Financing  Partnership  Facility  for  Promoting  an \nInterconnected, Inclusive, and Resilient Association of Southeast Asian Nations Capital Market, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n13 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n14 As in the memo of the Budget, Personnel and Management Systems Department (BPMSD) dated 28 February 2000 \nand a joint memo of the Strategy and Policy Department and the BPMSD dated 26 June 2013, in case ADB staff will \nact as resource persons for training, seminars, workshops, and other purposes of effectiveness and for preparatory \nworks, implementation, and administrative support, travel costs of ADB staff are charged to the regional TA while \ntheir salaries and benefits are absorbed by ADB\u2019s internal administrative expenses. \n15 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the TA is Aligned with \nInterconnected, inclusive, and resilient ASEAN capital market achieved (ACMF Action Plan 2016\u20132020)a \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Indicators with Targets \nResults Chain  Reporting  Risks \nand Baselines \nMechanisms \nOutcome  By 2021:     \nNumber of cross- a.
