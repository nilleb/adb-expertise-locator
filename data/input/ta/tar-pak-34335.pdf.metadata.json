In 2002 the Government of Pakistan requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide project preparatory technical assistance (TA) for the Balochistan Rural Development \nand Drought Mitigation Project. The ADB Fact-Finding Mission visited Pakistan during 2\u20138 \nMarch  2004  and  consulted  with  representatives  of  the  Government,  nongovernment \norganizations  (NGOs),  and  other  development  partner  agencies.  The  Mission  reached  an \nunderstanding with the Government on the objectives, scope, cost estimates and financing plan, \nimplementation arrangements, and outline terms of reference for the TA.1 The proposed project \nis environment category B. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Balochistan is the largest of Pakistan's four provinces (44% of the country\u2019s area), but is \nthe least developed and has the smallest population (with 7.1 million people, only 5.1% of the \ntotal population). The incidence of poverty is very pronounced in the province; literacy rates are \nvery low, especially for rural women (only 8%, compared to 20% for women in Pakistan). Over \n76% of the population is rural. Agriculture, the mainstay of the rural economy, accounts for over \n65% of the gross provincial domestic product, and employs 60\u201365% of the labor force. Crops \ncontribute  around  60%  of  the  gross  farm  income,  and  livestock  about  35%.  Subsistence \nagriculture and livestock rearing, poor quality rural roads and tracks, and inadequacy of access \nto public services, drinking water, health and education, characterize the province.  \n \n3.  Water supply is a critical and unreliable input in the agricultural system in Balochistan. \nMuch of the rural population depends on irrigation, either surface or groundwater, to engage in \nagriculture. This is so to the extent that groundwater is being mined, and the groundwater table \nis declining at a rapid rate. Rainfed agriculture is extremely risky, particularly in a drought \nsituation, which has prevailed in the province the past 5 years, with rainfall 50\u201360% below the \naverage annual rainfall of only 250 millimeters. The low level of rainfall has reduced the water \nflow in major rivers used for irrigation, affected rainfed agriculture, and further reduced the \ngroundwater table. The drought is compounded by inefficient agricultural practices, poor water \nmanagement in surface irrigation schemes, poor natural resource management practices, and \ndepletion  of  forest  resources,  which  are  also  an  effect  of  the  drought.  The  long-term \nenvironmental impacts of the drought are significant. A concerted effort is required to mitigate \nthese impacts, expedite the recovery of the natural resource base, and promote sustainable \ninterventions to alleviate poverty throughout this drought-stricken province. This will require \nimproved and integrated management of water and watershed resources to enable the rural \npoor to maintain their traditional agricultural systems, or begin new income-generating activities. \n \n4.  The drought has had a major impact on agricultural production in Balochistan. About \n30% of the livestock population has been depleted in the past 5 years, from a previous total of \n20 million ruminants (sheep and goats). Food and cash crop production, including orchards, \nhave also declined, leading to significant declines in income and food consumption. Malnutrition \nand a variety of drought-related diseases have also beset the rural poor. About 100,000 families \nhave been displaced, seeking drinking water and better pastureland for their animals. About 1.9 \nmillion people, or 27% of the province\u2019s population have been affected by the drought. Poverty \nlevels have increased, particularly among the poor and most vulnerable. Whereas about 38% of \nthe province was poor in 1997, an estimated 47% of the people are now below the poverty line.2  \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 18 May 2004. \n2  Government of Balochistan. 2003. Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. Quetta.  ", "2  \n \n5.  A number of governance issues contribute to the degree of poverty in Balochistan. First, \nprovincial management systems are inadequate. The lack of transparency, widespread wastage \nand leakages in expenditure, and frequent staff transfers result in an absence of accountability. \nSecond, the poor and marginalized, particularly women, are adversely affected by the traditional \nforms of dispute resolution, and lack of access to other redress mechanisms. Third, with the \nnew local government legislation assigning major responsibility for delivery of key services to \nelected district governments and lower levels of government, streamlined management systems \nand capacity development in the local governments are of crucial importance to enable them to \ndischarge their responsibilities. To alleviate rural poverty effectively, attention and interventions \nto address the issues is essential.3 \n \n6.  The  experience  and  lessons  learned  from  earlier  projects  show  that  the  intended \ndistribution of project benefits to the poor was not achieved because of inadequate attention to \nbeneficiary targeting in the project design. As a result, the relatively better-off farmers and \nlandowners with better contacts, information, and influence have benefited disproportionately \nfrom development projects. In other cases, benefits have been confined to small groups of the \npoor. Women have largely been bypassed in the development process, and women\u2019s groups \nhave  not  been  sustained.  The  institutional  impact  of  rural  development  projects  has  been \nminimal  because  local  communities  were  not  fully  involved  in  the  project  design  and \nimplementation, and the linkages with and involvement of local government institutions and \nagencies were weak. Thus, the impact on the rural society and community, particularly in \nrelation to women and the poor, has been marginal. The proposed Project will build on the \nexperience and lessons learned from previous and ongoing investments by focusing on poverty \ntargeting, women\u2019s empowerment, and facilitating social change. \n \n7.  The  provincial  government  developed  its  poverty  reduction  strategy  paper  after \nextensive consultation throughout the province. Five pillars of the province\u2019s poverty reduction \nstrategy  emerged  from  the  consultation  process,  and  include  (i)  engendering  growth,  (ii) \nmanaging the scarce water resources and ensuring sustainable natural resource exploitation, \n(iii) introducing governance reforms, (iv) improving human development, and (v) addressing the \nvulnerability to shocks by providing safety nets. The provincial government has enumerated a \nfour-pronged strategy to improve rural livelihoods, including (i) revival of the rural economy \nthrough improved opportunities for employment and income generation, particularly through \nrevitalization  of  the  agriculture  sector  and  promotion  of  small  and  medium  enterprise \ndevelopment; (ii) empowerment of the poor through expansion of the household asset base; \n(iii) improved  governance  and  the  institutional  environment;  and  (iv) improved  physical \ninfrastructure. These objectives are consistent with ADB\u2019s 2003 Country Strategy and Program \nUpdate  for  Pakistan,4  which  emphasizes  good  governance,  sustainable  pro-poor  economic \ngrowth, and inclusive social development. For pro-poor interventions in rural areas, in addition \nto  required  governance  reforms,  the  ADB  strategy  prioritizes  higher  economic  growth  and \nemployment  generation;  and  interventions  on  water  conservation,  drought  mitigation,  and \nrehabilitation of the irrigation infrastructure.  \n \n8.  The rural sector remains the major source of incomes and livelihood for the people of \nBalochistan, despite the recent severe drought. The TA and the proposed Project will build on \n                                                 \n3 ADB is currently providing TA to the Balochistan government to address some of these issues under ADB. 2003. \nTechnical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Balochistan Resource Management Program. \nManila.

", "  3\nthe  lessons  learned  from  experience,  and  the  fact  that  rural  development  and  drought \nmitigation, if well targeted and implemented, are an effective means of reducing rural poverty, \nespecially for women. The impact of the drought requires major improvements in mitigation \nmeasures, both in terms of natural resources and rangeland management, water conservation, \nand  better  management  of  water  for  irrigation.  Improved  local  governance  arrangements, \nincluding  improvements  in  public  goods  and  service  management,  consideration  of \nnongovernment  and  private  sector  alternatives,  and  enhanced  community  involvement  are \nessential to improve service delivery and development of the social capital of the poor, thereby \ncontributing to improved rural livelihoods. The TA and the proposed Project will seek to ensure \nthat the policy environment supports improved rural development and governance. The focus \nwill be on sustainable and socially equitable development. The proposed Project is consistent \nwith the provincial government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategies as enunciated in the \nprovincial government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy paper, the poverty partnership agreement \nbetween the Government and ADB, and ADB\u2019s 2003 country strategy and program update. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  The goal of the TA is to reduce the incidence of rural poverty in Balochistan Province \nthrough economic and social interventions that lead to increased rural incomes, create jobs, and \nreduce resource and environmental degradation. The purpose of the TA is to assess and \nprioritize interventions to stimulate economic development in rural areas and mitigate drought \nimpacts. The output of the TA will be the feasibility study and design of an investment project \nthat is suitable for external financing, possibly covering 18 seriously drought-affected and poor \ndistricts in the province. The technical assistance framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will be implemented in two phases over 5.5 months, from September 2004 to \nFebruary 2005. Phase 1 (3 months) will involve (i) preparing a draft work plan and identifying \ntarget  areas;  (ii)  conducting  a  detailed  poverty  and  social  analysis,  including  rapid  rural \nappraisals and baseline surveys; (iii) identifying stakeholders; (iv) reviewing lessons learned and \nincorporating them into the project design; (v) holding participatory workshops; (vi) collecting \ndata; (vii) planning the scope of the project components; and (viii) identifying policy issues. The \nTA  will  be  implemented  flexibly,  with  second  phase  consultant  inputs  determined  by  the \noutcome of the first phase studies and recommendations. Phase 2 (2.5 months) will involve \nfinalizing the feasibility study for an investment project. Extensive participatory consultation with \na wide range of stakeholders through numerous workshops will develop commitment to the \nparticipatory  development  process  that  will  be  promoted  during  the  Project\u2019s  design  and \nimplementation, and ownership of the project design.  \n \n11.  The TA will adopt a people-centered focus, as well as a pro-poor focus. A participatory    \napproach using various techniques to obtain the full participation and inputs of all stakeholders \nwill guide project planning and implementation. A partnership approach will use the strengths \nand resources of the public sector (provincial and district agencies), NGOs and community-\nbased organizations, the private sector (entrepreneurs, and private sector associations), and \nfarmers (in groups, associations, or cooperatives). A systems learning approach will be used \nthat ensures a thorough understanding of the agricultural, economic, and social systems in rural \nBalochistan; and will provide flexibility, engender commitment, and a sense of stakeholder \nownership  of  the  Project.  The  project  design  will  provide  flexibility  for  subsequent  project \n ", "4  \nmanagement\u2014project elements can be modified as progress and experience dictate. Lessons \nlearned from relevant previous and ongoing projects will be incorporated into the project design. \nA summary initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n12.  The TA will prepare a feasibility study for a project that targets poverty reduction and \npromotes  gender  equality,  job  creation,  private  sector  involvement  and  public-private \npartnerships, and drought mitigation. The TA will review agriculture and rural development \nexperience in the country, and particularly Balochistan. The TA will analyze alternatives, and \nphase  2  of  the  TA  will  finalize  the  feasibility  of  possible  interventions  to  (i)  strengthen \nagricultural,  crop,  and  particularly  livestock  services,  and  productivity  to  increase  farmer \nincomes and employment, particularly of poor farmers; (ii) promote improved marketing, and \nagriculture enterprises and service delivery through the private sector; (iii) mitigate the impact of \nthe  current  drought,  focusing  on  community  watershed  and  rangeland  management \nimprovements,  and  water  conservation  measures  using  water  harvesting  and  small  scale \ncommunity irrigation structures; (iv) improve farm-to-market access linkages through rural roads \nto promote agricultural production and marketing opportunities for poor farmers; (v) build the \ncapacity of poor communities and local government offices, including community mobilization \nand gender integration, particularly women empowerment; and (vi) address gender and social \ninclusion issues.  \n \n13.  The TA will develop linkages with interventions of the Government to improve local \ngovernance  that  are  being  supported  by  development  partners  (the  United  Nations \nDevelopment  Programme,  the  World  Bank,  and  others),  and  work  closely  with  the  ADB \nDecentralization Support Program5 and the Balochistan Resource Management Program TA \n(footnote 3). Taking into account these interventions, the TA will review the implementation of \nthe  new  local  government  system  and  recommend  any  additional  required  institutional \nstrengthening  and  capacity  building  needed.  Relevant  policy  actions  recommended  by  the \nBalochistan Resource Management TA for implementation will be incorporated into the design \nof the Project.  \n   \nC.  Cost And Financing \n14.  The TA will cost $750,000 equivalent, comprising a foreign exchange cost of $302,500 \nand local currency cost of $447,500 equivalent. The TA will be financed, on a grant basis, with \n$300,000 equivalent being financed by the Government of Denmark and $300,000 equivalent \nby ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government has given its assurance that when the TA \nbegins, it will contribute the remaining local currency cost of $150,000 equivalent for office \naccommodation, equipment, counterpart staff support, field transport, facilities for workshops, \nand  other  administrative  expenses.  The  Government  will  provide  all  relevant  information \nrequired for the TA activities. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \nThe Government has been advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be the Balochistan Local Government Department \n(BLGD),  which  will  be  responsible  for  coordination  with  concerned  provincial  and  federal \ngovernment departments and agencies, district governments, NGOs, development partners, \n                                                 \n5 ADB. 2002.

Yes  poverty partnership agreement?  Yes \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Pakistan: \nBalochistan is Pakistan\u2019s largest province in terms of area (44%) but the smallest in terms of \npopulation (7.1 million people, only 5.1% of the total population). According to the Balochistan poverty \nreduction  strategy  paper  (April  2003),  social  indicators  are  poor,  gender  disparities  are  large,  and \nestimated poverty levels as high as 47%. Social indicators, particularly those related to women, are also \nworse than those of other provinces, with the 1998 literacy rate for rural women barely 8% (compared to \n20% for women in Pakistan), gross primary enrolment rate of 62% (44% for girls), and infant mortality rate \nof 108 per 1,000 live births. Only 33% of the land area is productive grazing or agricultural land.  Over 76% \nof the population is rural, with agriculture the mainstay of the rural economy, accounting for over 65% of \nthe provincial gross domestic product, and employing 60\u201365% of the labor force, mainly in livestock rearing \nand dry land farming. Crops contribute around 60% of the gross farm income and livestock about 35%. \nSubsistence agriculture and livestock rearing, inadequate and poor quality rural roads and tracks, and \nlimited access to public services (water, health, and education) characterize the province. \nThe Government has assigned high priority to development of the productive sectors of the rural \neconomy, \u2014prevention of natural resource and environmental degradation, provision of social and physical \ninfrastructure (roads and water), microfinance, social protection (food support and welfare), building of \npartnerships with civil society, and governance reforms (decentralization, civil service, and access to \njustice). The poverty reduction strategy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) describes poverty as a \ndeprivation of essential assets and opportunities to which every human being is entitled. In line with the \nADB strategy, the rural development activities examined in the technical assistance (TA) build on the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts, with a core element of women\u2019s empowerment in parallel with improvement of \naccess to opportunities for growth in agriculture and livestock, efficient  water and natural resource \nmanagement, nonfarm employment, and rural road infrastructure, with leading roles for civil society \norganizations, the private sector, and local government. \nB.  Poverty Analysis  Proposed Classification:  CPI \nTo ensure that targeting of poor small-scale farmers and women is achieved and project benefits \nreach the poor, it is essential that an understanding of the poverty environment and of poor households be \ndeveloped before embarking on project design. A systems learning approach will be used that ensures a \nthorough understanding of the agricultural, economic, and social systems in rural Balochistan. Analytical \npapers will examine natural resource management and environmental conditions, including common \nproperty and asset ownership by women; agribusiness, marketing, and enterprise promotion; livestock; \nroad and road infrastructure; social and poverty studies with emphasis on gender; and local governance \nand institutions, including nongovernment organizations (NGOs). Poverty studies, drawing from recent \nparticipatory poverty appraisals and supplemented if necessary by fieldwork, will profile the characteristics \nof poverty and of the poor households on a gender-disaggregated basis. Area-specific and gender-\ndisaggregated poverty targeting indicators will be developed for use in the design of project interventions \naimed at the poor, to ensure that the Project will be in areas of high poverty concentration to benefit \nvulnerable groups. \nC.  Participation Process \nA participatory approach using various techniques to obtain the full participation and inputs of all \nstakeholders will guide project planning and implementation. A partnership approach will use the strengths \nand resources of the public sector, the private sector, NGOs, and farmers. The technical assistance will \ninclude (i) a social assessment (social, political, and economic relations of associations; inequality; local \n ", "Appendix 2          9  \nelites; patronage; and group organizations), including gender relations and asset ownership by women and \nland titling; and (ii) an assessment of communities and formal institutions (government, private, and civil \nsociety) and the strengths of institutions, their role and scope. \nTogether with poverty studies, the assessment of social, NGO, and local governance institutions \nwill provide the basis for recommendations on roles and responsibilities of the stakeholders as well as their \ncapacity building needs. \nExtensive stakeholder consultations will be used in the TA. Workshops, focus group discussions, \nand appropriate media will be used in the consultations. The workshops will be held in the project districts \nto discuss results of the analysis and assessments, the selection criteria for project subdistricts, and the \ndevelopment  initiatives.  Project  area  communities,  NGOs,  women\u2019s  groups,  district  governments, \nprovincial government, and ADB representatives will participate in the workshops. \nThe TA will indicate, as part of the project design, the modalities for adopting a systems learning \nprocess approach in participatory planning, implementation, and monitoring\u2014clearly indicating how the \ndistrict government will adapt to a facilitation role. \nD.  Gender and Development \nEmpowerment of women will be a core element of the TA by providing opportunities for women to \nparticipate  in  project  preparation  by  improving  access  to  information  and  ultimately  to  loan  funded \nactivities. Comprehensive gender analysis will lead to mainstreaming gender throughout the proposed \nproject. \nA gender plan in line with the gender reform action plan will be required and prepared during TA \nimplementation. \nE.

Taking into account at the outset work and \nstudies under the ADB-supported Decentralization Support Program, the TA for \nthe  Balochistan  Resource  Management  Program,  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment Program\u2019s support for decentralization, and other initiatives, review \nas required institutional arrangements of the provincial and district governments \nand  their  roles,  responsibilities,  staffing,  capacities,  and  capabilities;  review \ngovernment  outreach,  linkages,  and  cooperation  with  the  private  sector  and \nNGOs; taking into account work under the same initiatives, identify gaps and \nareas  where  additional  support  is  required,  and  make  recommendations  for \ncapacity  building  of  relevant  offices  of  the  local  government  that  may  be \nnecessary to implement and sustain the core project interventions. \n \n3.  Presentation Meetings  \n \n4.  Present the work conducted in Phase 1 to the provincial and local governments, civil \nsociety, the private sector, and other stakeholders in participatory workshops to be held at \nselected district headquarters. Views of the participants will be sought on the project design. \n \n  4.  Participatory Project Design  \n \n5.  On the basis of the analytical studies and the consultation meetings, the consultants will, \nin consultation with district governments and a range of stakeholders, prepare (i) feasible and \nrelevant prioritized entry points for the Project concerning women and the poor (possibly in rural \n ", "Appendix 4          15  \ninfrastructure, agriculture, livestock, and functional literacy and empowerment of women); (ii) \npoverty  targeting  indicators;  (iii)  selection  criteria  for  project  activities,  interventions,  and \nsubproject selection; and (iv) the broad strategy for project implementation, including fund flows. \nSpecifically, identify and consider a variety of useful linkages and synergies across sectors, and \nall levels, both public and private, and geographically, to provide a basis for the focused and \ntargeted design of appropriately sequenced project interventions. \n \n6.  Carefully  assess  the  scope  and  geographic  coverage  of  ongoing  or  planned \ninterventions  in  the  districts,  particularly  where  a  number  of  similar  programs  are  being \nimplemented. TA consultant inputs will be flexibly managed to provide expertise in the focused \nareas of intervention identified during the early stages of phase 1. Identify prioritized entry points \non a district-specific basis from alternative simple, small-scale interventions. Develop criteria for \ndistrict  selection,  and  determine  the  number  of  participating  districts  after  the  consultation \nmeetings. After determining the number of participating districts, examine the appropriateness \nof using the existing provincial resource distribution formula to allocate project funds to the \ndistricts.  \n \nC.
