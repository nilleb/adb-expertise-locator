THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Shanxi  Inclusive  Agricultural  Value  Chain \nDevelopment Project. The report also describes the proposed technical assistance (TA) for the \nShanxi Inclusive Agricultural Value Chain Development Project; and if the Board approves the \nproposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.  \n2.  The project will help the Shanxi Provincial Government (SPG) increase income-generating \nopportunities (IGOs) from selected local specialty agricultural products, to alleviate poverty and \nnarrow rural\u2212urban income disparity, by strengthening agricultural value chains (AVCs) and \npiloting inclusive business mechanism. \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Shanxi is in the northern PRC, forming a highland with mountains in the east and south. \nThe province is known for rich mineral resources, including coal. In 2015, the provincial per capita \ngross domestic product of CNY34,919 was among the five lowest in the PRC.1 Rural households \nhave a per capita disposable income that is 36.6% of urban households\u2019 per capita disposable \nincome. The provincial poverty incidence remains substantial (9.6%), as compared to the national \naverage of 5.7%. \n4.  Shanxi is undergoing a significant transformation from a coal-dependent economy, and is \na key example of the PRC government\u2019s efforts to reduce rural\u2013urban income inequality and \npoverty. Shanxi is the second-largest coal producer in the PRC, supplying one-fourth of domestic \ncoal production.2 For the last 3 decades, the province has experienced rapid economic growth by \nliterally fueling the economic growth of coastal regions of the PRC. However, this coal-dependent \ngrowth has made the provincial economy vulnerable to fluctuations in external coal price and \ndemand. The coal price decline that began in 2011 has made Shanxi\u2019s coal industry financially \nunfeasible, and forced the province to reduce production during 2016\u20132020 by at least 100 million \ntons, which is more than 10% of 2015 production level.3 This is expected to significantly impact \nthe rural population employed in the coal industry. Transforming the coal-dependent economy to \na broad-based economy that creates viable IGOs for the rural population has become an urgent \ntask for Shanxi Province. \n5.  The agriculture sector is the key to transforming the economy and addressing income \ndisparity and poverty. Agriculture is an important means of livelihood for the rural population in \nShanxi Province\u2014in 2015, 16.5 million rural inhabitants (45% of the provincial population) relied \non agriculture as an income source.4 Despite this, the sector contributed only 6.1% to the \nprovincial gross domestic product, the lowest of all provinces in the PRC (excluding coastal \nprovinces and municipalities with limited agricultural production). This is due to low productivity \nand low value addition in the agriculture sector, which thus creates insufficient IGOs for the rural \npopulation. \n6.  Small-scale and low-value addition in agriculture. The agriculture sector comprises \nvarious stakeholders, including farmers, cooperatives, and agribusiness companies involved in \n                                                \n1  National Bureau of Statistics of China. 2016. China Statistical Yearbook. Beijing. \n2  https://www.worldcoal.com/coal/06052016/china-coal-production-continues-to-fall-2016-731/. \n3  The province produced 944 million tons of raw coal in 2015, but lost CNY9.42 billion (CNY10 per ton of coal sold). \n4  An average of 30% of the rural household income in Shanxi Province is generated from agricultural activities. ", "2 \nprocessing, marketing, and/or distribution. Those stakeholders form loose cooperation in the \nprovince. Poor performance of the agriculture sector in Shanxi stems from these underdeveloped \nvalue chains, which limits the ability to increase value addition and expand agricultural production. \nThese weak value chains result primarily from the absence of agribusiness companies capable \nof  leading  the  chains\u2014particularly  processors  that  link  the  small  farmers  to  the  markets. \nAgribusiness  companies  in the  province  lack  adequate  business  strategies  and  production \nfacilities of sufficient size; when combined with a lack of collateral, this makes it difficult for those \ncompanies to access finance, and prevents them from expanding operations and realizing \neconomies of scale. Primary production bases are small and scattered, making it difficult for those \ncompanies to source sufficient volumes of quality raw materials in a timely manner. It is crucial to \nstrengthen the capacity of agribusiness companies to lead the AVCs, which will improve the \nagriculture sector\u2019s performance in the province. \n7.  Limited viable employment generation for poor and low-income people. Although it \nis  important  to  nurture  the  leading  agribusiness  companies,  their  capacity  to  generate \nemployment that would benefit poor and low-income people depends on their business strategies, \nwhich are in turn impacted by the government\u2019s industrial policy. Since 2012, the government has \npromoted agricultural industrialization by supporting \u201cdragon-head enterprises,\u201d which are defined \nas companies that have the potential to drive agricultural and rural economic restructuring; \nincrease efficiency in agricultural production; and eventually increase farmer incomes.5 Despite \nthis effort, limited IGOs have been created for poor and low-income people. To reduce income \ndisparity  and  eradicate  poverty,  agribusiness  companies  need  to  adopt  pro-poor  business \nstrategies. \n8.  Strategic fit. Supporting inclusive economic growth is a strategic priority for the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in its country partnership strategy for the PRC.6 SPG requested ADB \nassistance in eradicating extreme poverty and improving livelihoods in the poverty-stricken areas \nof Shanxi Province, by tapping the potential of the agriculture sector in developing rural IGOs. \nSPG particularly requested help in implementing the PRC\u2019s new rural development policy to \npromote agriculture-based industry for local specialty agricultural products, as part of the Shanxi \nPoverty Alleviation and Rural Development Program. This project supports the improvement of \nmarket connectivity and value-chain linkages, which is one of the four priority areas of ADB\u2019s \nOperational Plan for Agriculture and Natural Resources.7 The improvement of rural livelihoods, \nand particularly eradicating extreme poverty by 2020, is a key priority under the PRC\u2019s Thirteenth \nFive-Year Plan on National Economic and Social Development, 2016\u20132020.8 \n9.  Lessons. The project design incorporates lessons from relevant projects financed by ADB \nand others in the PRC, including (i) enabling farmers and agribusiness companies to finance \nlonger-term investment to increase production, improve productivity, and enhance value addition; \n(ii) engaging agribusiness companies to generate IGOs; (iii) helping farmers improve access to \nmarkets, and improve product quality control through cooperation with agribusiness companies; \n                                                \n5  According to the State Council in 2012, dragon head enterprises are defined as private or state-owned enterprises \nresponsible for opening new markets, innovating in science and technology, driving farm households, and advancing \nregional economic development. Sixteen of the 19 project agribusiness companies and cooperative (PACs) have \ndragon-head enterprise status granted by the national, provincial, municipal, and/or county governments. \n6  ADB. 2016.

The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) all rural residents falling below the \nPRC\u2019s current poverty line and all poor counties lifted out of poverty, and poverty alleviation in all \nregions achieved (footnote 8); and (ii) rural\u2013urban income disparity narrowed, and the proportion \nof the population in the middle-income class increased.10 The project will have the following \noutcome: IGOs from selected local specialty agricultural products increased.11 \nC.  Outputs \n11.  The outcome will be accomplished through two outputs: (i) AVCs strengthened, and (ii) \ninclusive  business  mechanism  piloted.  These  outputs  will  primarily  be  implemented  (with \ngovernment support) by the 19 project agribusiness companies and cooperative (PACs) that are \ncapable of leading value chains of different specialized agricultural products in different parts of \nthe province. The 19 PACs are divided into two groups: 9 PACs that will be engaged to \ndemonstrate model AVCs under output 1 (PAC1s), and 10 PACs that will be engaged to \ndemonstrate model inclusive businesses under output 2 (PAC2s). \n12.  Output  1:  Agricultural  value  chains  strengthened.  Nine  PAC1s  (five  companies \nproducing,  processing,  and/or  marketing  fruits,  vegetable,  mushrooms,  and  wine;  and  four \noperating livestock and poultry farms) will demonstrate respective value chain strengthening\u2014\nthrough investment and capacity building\u2014that provides possible approaches to overcoming the \nlimitations of agriculture in the province, in terms of scale of operation and extent of value addition. \nInvestment components will help PAC1s scale up and/or upgrade their primary production bases, \nprocessing facilities and cold storage facilities, animal sheds, a biogas digester, and research and \ndevelopment  facilities  based  on  their  respective  investment  designs. 12  Non-investment \ncomponents  will  comprise  (i)  technical  support  for  PAC1s,  including  training  and  advisory \nservices; (ii) preparation of the AVC action plans for six PAC1s based on PAC-wise value chain \nanalyses and implementation of the AVC plans to demonstrate model AVCs;13 (iii) training for \nagribusiness companies, cooperatives, farmers, and relevant government agencies on the value \nchain  approach;  (iv)  training  for  cooperatives  and  farmers  on  institutional  and  financial \nmanagement; and cooperation arrangements in production, processing, and contracting; (v) \nawareness-raising and training for service providers such as financial institutions and logistics \nservices providers on business opportunities in AVC; and (vi) study tours on best practices on \nAVCs.14 This project will be the first ADB sovereign project in the PRC to take a value chain \n                                                \n9  Recent projects include ADB. 2016.

Output  2:  Inclusive  business  mechanism  piloted.  Ten  PAC2s  will  demonstrate \ninclusive  business  models\u2014through  investment  and  capacity  building\u2014that  will  generate \nsubstantive employment that targets poor and low-income people. They include eight companies \nproducing, processing, and/or trading various products (e.g., coarse grains, mushrooms, fruits, \nvegetables, seedlings, and herbal plants); and two companies operating a livestock farm and a \npoultry  farm.  This  output  will  also  establish  and  pilot-test  the  localized  inclusive  business \nmechanism (LIBM). The investment component will help PAC2s scale up and/or improve their \nprimary production bases, processing workshops, storages, animal sheds, a biogas digester, and \nproduct  quality  control  facilities  based  on  PAC-specific  investment  designs;16 and  further \ndemonstrate inclusive business models based on inclusive business action plans.17 The non-\ninvestment component will  comprise (i)  technical  support to  PAC2s,  including training  and \nadvisory services;18 (ii) support to SPG in the design and implementation of the LIBM, which \nentails company appraisal, incubation, monitoring, evaluation, and recognition, to systematically \npromote inclusive business; (iii) preparation of inclusive business action plans for all PAC2s and \nassistance in their implementation; (iv) LIBM training for the Shanxi Poverty Alleviation and \nDevelopment  Office  and  the  Shanxi  Provincial  Agriculture  Department;  (v)  training  for \nagribusiness companies on the inclusive business approach; (vi) preparation and sharing of \nexperiences and a policy brief on the LIBM with SPG and the government for their consideration \nto incorporate the LIBM in the PRC\u2019s Fourteenth Five-Year Plan; (vii) study tours on best practices \non inclusive business; and (viii) dissemination of LIBM implementation achievements. \n14.  Inclusive business approach.19 Inclusive business refers to a business model that is \ncommercially viable and provides scaled up, innovative, and systemic solutions to the relevant \nproblems of poor and low-income people. Inclusive business has become a global initiative that \ntackles poverty and persistent inequality through private sector engagement, and national-level \naction has been called for. This project will be the first donor-funded sovereign project in the PRC \nto implement an inclusive business approach. The approach has been selected specifically to \ngenerate employment opportunities for farmers, and particularly poor and low-income people. \nProject design features include PAC selection based on inclusive business criteria (footnote 16); \ndevelopment of inclusive business action plans, which ensures the qualification of PAC2s for \ninclusive business and intended social impacts; inclusive business advisory services to the \n                                                \n15 Value chain analysis involves breaking a chain into its constituent parts to better understand its structure and function. \nIt has been widely used in business, development, and academia, and for different sectors. \n16 The selection was made during project preparation based on an assessment of the companies\u2019 current operation \nand performance and project investment plans using an inclusive business appraisal tool that rates markets and \nvalue chains, financial performance, and the investment\u2019s social impact and innovation, and aggregates the scores \ninto a single index to identify inclusive businesses. Development of the inclusive business scoring tool and its \napplication for company selection (Annex 1 of the PAM) was supported by ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance for \nInclusive Business Support. Manila (TA 8550-REG). \n17 Inclusive business models in agribusiness firms are characterized by three major social impact channels: (i) \ngeneration of employment and IGOs on a large scale through business expansion, (ii) better payment than \ncompetitors by sourcing higher-value products or paying better prices, and (iii) improvement of livelihoods through \nreduced risks and better living conditions. \n18 Technical Report on Inclusive Business (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 The Group of Twenty (G20) and the international development agencies agreed on the G20 Inclusive Business \nFramework to propose a way forward for governments, the private sector, and other stakeholders. The G20 is an \ninternational forum for the governments and central bank governors from 20 major economies. http://g20.org.tr/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2015/11/G20-Inclusive-Business-Framework.pdf. \n ", "5 \nPAC2s to help them ensure financial feasibility, while achieving  target social impacts; and piloting \nof the LIBM to ensure the inclusive business approach can be sustained and replicated to achieve \nwider social impacts in the province. \nD.

The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table \n3 and described in detail in the PAM. \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2018\u2014December 2022 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2022 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 June 2023 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Provincial project leading group \nChair: vice governor of the Shanxi Provincial Government \n(ii)  Executing agency  Shanxi Provincial Government, represented by the Shanxi Poverty \nAlleviation and Development Office \n(iii) Key implementing  17 project county governments (Datong, Fenxi, Fushan, Guangling, \nagencies  Heshun, Jishan, Liulin, Qin, Quwo, Ruicheng, Shilou, Taigu, Xiangning, \nXinjiang, Yanhu District, Yaodu District, and Yuanqu)a \n(iv) Implementation units  19 project agribusiness companies and cooperative \nProcurement  International competitive bidding  3 contracts  $17.97 million \nNational competitive bidding  34 contracts  $79.09 million \nShopping  1 contract  $0.05 million \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost-based  2 contracts (102.5   \nselection  person-months)  $2.20 million \nRetroactive financing  Retroactive financing and advance contracting are expected for \nand/or advance contracting  consulting services. \nDisbursement   The loan proceeds will be disbursed following the Asian Development \nBank\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to \ntime) and detailed arrangements agreed between the Asian \nDevelopment Bank and the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina.  \na  Yaodu and Yanhu districts are county-level districts. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n                                                \n22 Details on the estimates of climate risk adaptation and mitigation measures can be found in the Climate Vulnerability \nAssessment and Management Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nIII.  ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n21.  The outputs of the transaction TA will comprise (i) capacity building of the implementing \nagencies and PACs on safeguards, financial management, and procurement; and (ii) project \nimplementation monitoring and reporting. The executing agency is SPG. Although the PPMO has \nexperience with an ADB project, loan implementation consultants to be financed by the TA will be \nnecessary for proper management of the project. The outputs and activities, cost estimates, \nfinancing plan, and implementation arrangements of the TA are described in the attached TA \nreport.23 The TA is estimated to cost $300,000 to be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The TA implementation period is the same as \nthe project implementation period. \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n22.  Climate change. A climate vulnerability assessment and management report found the \nthreat posed to project viability by climate change as medium to low. Climate projections suggest \nthat temperature and precipitation will increase during 2041\u20132060 compared with the baseline \nperiod (1961\u20131960). Extreme weather events (e.g., droughts, severe storms) will likely become \nmore intense and frequent in Shanxi Province. Adaptation measures were incorporated in the \nproject design to (i) cope with anticipated climate change impacts, and (ii) manage the emission \nof greenhouse gases from project activities. The adaptation measures include those for the \nprotection  of  livestock, crops,  and facilities from  excessive  heat  or  cold,  including  through \nupgraded greenhouse structures; improved disease control; and water-saving measures to cope \nwith increased water demands for crops and trees, and drought. The mitigation measures include \nadoption  of  energy-saving  technologies,  livestock  waste  biogas  recovery  or  fermentation \ntechnologies;  upgraded  insulation for  all  buildings;  light-emitting  diode  lighting  and  energy-\nefficiency equipment; and green belts with trees and grass for shading and increasing rainfall \nabsorption  and  drainage  capacity.  The  adaptation  and  mitigation  measures  have  been \nincorporated in the project design. \nB.  Economic and Financial \n23.  The economic analysis indicated that the project is viable with an economic internal rate \nof return of 23.3% and an economic net present value of CNY1,888 million. The analysis also \nconfirms the economic viability of all subprojects, with economic internal rates of return ranging \nfrom 9.2% to 36.5%, above the economic opportunity cost of capital of 9%. Sensitivity analysis \nconfirmed the project is economically viable even under negative scenarios. The financial analysis \nconfirmed the project\u2019s financial viability and sustainability. The financial evaluation found all \nsubprojects and the entire project were financially viable, with financial internal rates of return of \n4.4% to 34.2%, above the weighted average cost of capital. The entity financial analysis showed \nthat all PACs will be able to maintain reasonable financial performance over time based on \nfinancial ratios computed from their respective projected financial statements.24 \nC.  Governance \n24.  The financial management assessment was conducted for SPG, PCGs, and PACs; and \nconcluded that, in light of the mitigation measures, the prevailing structure and system of project \n                                                \n23 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Economic Analysis and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nfinancial management is appropriate. The overall project financial management risk is moderate \non a pre-mitigation basis. The assessment recommended an action plan to mitigate the identified \nfinancial management risks, including training on ADB financial management requirements such \nas loan disbursement; this is to be implemented by SPG during the project. The procurement risk \nassessment indicated that (i) SPG and the PCGs have the experience to undertake public \nprocurement of consulting services, goods, and works; and (ii) monitoring and internal controls \nregarding procurement are generally in place, but PACs lack experience on foreign-funded \nprojects. Mitigation measures will include (i) early engagement of a procurement agent and project \nimplementation  consultant,  and  (ii)  provision  of  training  on  ADB  procurement  policies  and \nprocedures during the project. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government,  SPG,  and  PACs.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n25.  Poverty and social. The project is classified as targeted intervention-geographic for \npoverty reduction, emphasizing generation of IGOs for farmers in poverty-stricken areas. Poor \nand low-income people comprise significant portions of the project beneficiaries. A total of 73,250 \nhouseholds with 209,100 persons, of whom 49% are women and 54% are low-income people, \nare expected to benefit from cooperation with PACs, including as employees, contractual farmers, \nraw material suppliers, and recipients of subsidized inputs and services. The inclusive business \napproach  is  expected  to  enhance  the  socioeconomic  benefits  for  low-income  people  and \ncontribute to inclusive social development and poverty reduction in the project areas. A poverty \nand social analysis has been undertaken and a social development action plan prepared, with \nspecific  targets  committed  to  by  PACs.  Consultations  have  been  held  with  farmers  and \nstakeholders during project preparation, and consultation and participation measures for project \nimplementation have been included in the social development action plan. \n26.  Gender.  The  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming,  following  the \nGuidelines for Gender Mainstreaming Categories of ADB Projects.25 The project is expected to \nbenefit women significantly (majority of the agricultural workforce are women). A gender action \nplan has been prepared based on gender analyses to ensure the project contributes to improved \ngender equality. The gender action plan includes specific targets: (i) women are to (a) hold 40%\u2013\n50% of jobs in PACs\u2019 operations; (b) make up 45%\u201350% of beneficiaries in contract farming and \nraw material supply to PACs; (c) hold 30% of jobs in construction; (d) have workplace facilities \nseparate from those for men; (e) make up 30% of project staff; (f) account for 50% of farmers \ninvolved in consultation, participation, and capacity building; and (ii) gender-disaggregated data \nare to be collected for monitoring. Key gender indicators have been included in the design and \nmonitoring framework. \n27.  Capacity for implementation and monitoring of social measures. The PPMO has \nexperience in implementing projects, including an ADB-financed agriculture project.26 However, it \ndoes not have experience with projects that require monitoring of social measures compliance by \na private company. To implement social measures properly, (i) the PPMO, the county project \nmanagement offices, and PACs will each appoint a staff member as a social focal point, who will \nbe provided training on social measures; and (ii) an external social expert will be recruited to \n                                                \n25 ADB. 2012.

In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.27 \n29.  Environment (category B). An initial environmental examination (IEE) report and an \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) have been prepared; these were based on the approved \ndomestic feasibility study reports, environmental assessments, and site visits. Consultations were \nheld with affected people and government agencies, and the outcomes integrated in the project \ndesign. The draft IEE was disclosed on the ADB website on 28 June 2017. SPG, through the \nPPMO, will be responsible for the EMP implementation and compliance, including inspection, \nmonitoring,  reporting,  and  initiating  corrective  actions  or  measures.  The  PCGs  serving  as \nimplementing  agencies  lack  prior  experience  with  ADB  safeguard  procedures,  and  loan \nimplementation consultants and a capacity building program have been included in the project \ndesign. The IEE will be updated as needed during detailed project design preparation. \n30.  The  project  is  expected  to  achieve  environmental  benefits,  including  improved \nmanagement  of  wastewater,  livestock  manure,  and  agricultural  chemicals;  and  increased \nefficiency of water resource use in existing and new facilities. Anticipated construction impacts \ninclude  localized  and  temporary  air,  dust,  noise,  vibration,  and  erosion  impacts.  Potential \noperational risks include the unsustainable use of groundwater or surface water, and increased \nuse of agricultural chemicals. The risk of indirect, cumulative, and/or induced impacts was \nassessed. Mitigation measures have been described in the EMP; these included the preparation \nof subproject water management plans, waste treatment systems, and improved management of \npesticides and fertilizers. All project activities will be located on lands already zoned and modified \nfor development and that support existing PAC facilities. The livestock subprojects comply with \ndomestic requirements for minimum distances from residential areas. The IEE concludes that \neffective EMP implementation, together with the prescribed training, will result in residual impacts \nwithin the limits of PRC and/or international standards as defined in the EMP. \n31.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). The project will not involve involuntary land \nacquisition and resettlement impacts, but will involve voluntary land use by PACs, affecting a total \nof 19,857 mu (1,324 hectares) of land.28 The land use rights for most of this land (19,315 mu) \nhave been leased from 1,819 households, while the remaining 542 mu is state-owned land. Due \ndiligence has concluded that the land use agreements have followed required procedures: \nfarmers were informed and consulted regarding the land use; agreements were voluntary; farmers \nwill benefit fairly from rents as well as other benefits, such as employment to be provided by \nPACs; and the project will not have adverse impacts on the farmers. Due diligence has also \nconfirmed  that  no  issues  will  trigger  involuntary  resettlement  requirements  under  the  ADB \nSafeguard Policy Statement. With the help of an external social expert (who will serve under the \nproject), SPG has agreed to monitor land leases, resolve any issues, and report findings annually \nduring project implementation. \n                                                \n27 ADB.

The project will not impact any distinct and vulnerable \nethnic minority communities, and not trigger indigenous people\u2019s requirements under the ADB \nSafeguard Policy Statement. \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n33.  The risk assessment of the overall project is medium, and the benefits and impacts are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. Risks (which were all rated low or moderate) and mitigation \nmeasures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.29 \nV.  ASSURANCES \n34.  The government and SPG have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n35.  The government and SPG have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \nwhich are set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. Withdrawals from the ADB loan \naccount will not be made for any onlending to a PAC until it has signed an onlending agreement \nwith the relevant PCG. \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n36.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $90,000,000 \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Shanxi Inclusive Agricultural Value Chain Development \nProject, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with interest to be determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term \nof 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project agreements presented \nto the Board. \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n29 August 2017 \n                                                \n29 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n Impacts the Project is Aligned with \nAll rural residents falling below the current poverty line of the People\u2019s Republic of China and all poor \ncounties lifted out of poverty, and poverty alleviation in all regions achieved (Thirteenth Five-Year Plan for \nNational Economic and Social Development)a \nRural\u2013urban income disparity narrowed and the proportion of the population in the middle-income class \nincreased (Shanxi Provincial Thirteenth Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development)b \nData Sources \nPerformance Indicators  and Reporting \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome       \nIncome- a. 6,151 new jobs created by project agribusiness  a.\u2013c.
