INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will strengthen judicial capacity in \nadjudicating commercial and environmental and climate change disputes in selected Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) developing member countries (DMCs); develop knowledge resources \nfor  more  effective  and  efficient  adjudication  of  these  disputes;  and  foster  regional  judicial \nknowledge sharing and cooperation.1 The TA will build on ADB\u2019s work with judiciaries over the \nyears;2 and establish a more programmatic judicial capacity building program aligned with the \ndevelopment needs of the participating ADB DMCs.3 \n \n2.  The TA supports ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational priorities on strengthening governance \nand institutional capacity; tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and \nenhancing environmental sustainability; and fostering regional cooperation and integration.4 It is \nalso in line with Strategy 2030\u2019s goal of expanding private sector development. Further, the TA \nsupports ADB DMCs\u2019 commitments under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 13 and \n16, particularly target 16.3 on the promotion of the rule of law to ensure equal access to justice; \nand target 16.6 on developing effective, accountable, and transparent institutions. \n \nII.  ISSUES  \n \n3.  Strong and well-equipped judiciaries that uphold the rule of law are essential to ensuring \nthat development goals are met in ADB DMCs. Strengthening the capacity of judiciaries can help \nencourage foreign and domestic investment and private sector development through the effective \nand efficient resolution of commercial disputes and enforcement of contracts. At the same time, \njudiciaries can positively affect sustainable development outcomes in ADB DMCs by interpreting \nand enforcing environmental and climate change laws and developing seminal jurisprudence that \nis responsive to sustainable development issues. Nevertheless, judiciaries across the region face \nsignificant challenges, ranging from inadequate resources to lack of expertise in complex and \nspecialized areas of the law. 5 Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has put judiciaries under \nfurther pressure to increase efficiency while ensuring quality decisions and access to justice.  \n \n4.  Adjudication of commercial disputes. There is a demonstrable need for commercial \nlaw judicial capacity building in many ADB DMCs where substantial reform efforts are taking place \nto increase private sector development and cross-border trade and foreign investments.6 Many \njudges in developing economies lack knowledge and experience in commercial law matters. \nFurthermore, commercial law judicial capacity is unevenly distributed among judiciaries despite \nthe delivery of training by various development partners over the years. Consequently, the \n \n1   The TA concept paper was approved by the relevant ADB Vice President on 26 November 2020. \n2  ADB. 2010.

Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n5   There is continued need for judicial capacity building due to evolving laws and rotation of judges. The capacity \nbuilding programs also need to address the varying levels of judicial knowledge. \n6   In many ADB DMCs, rankings on judicial quality are among the lowest in the world. For example, out of 141 countries, \nCambodia is ranked 116, the Kyrgyz Republic is ranked 106, Mongolia is ranked 120, and the Philippines is ranked \n110. World Economic Forum. 2019. The Global Competitiveness Report 2019. Geneva. \n ", "2 \nadjudication of commercial matters in these courts has resulted in uncertainties in judicial \ndecisions, lengthy contract enforcement, and higher transaction costs for parties, which ultimately \ndeter investment and economic growth.  \n \n5.  Moreover,  with  the  internationalization  of  commercial  transactions,  it  has  become \nessential to equip judges with an understanding of law in a transnational setting.7 The increasing \nmulti-jurisdictional nature of legal disputes requires judicial readiness to handle complex cross-\nborder commercial disputes, as well as cross-border insolvency cases, which have become \nparticularly relevant in the COVID-19 era.8 Additionally, judicial support for alternative dispute \nresolution and the application of best practices are required, e.g., in the enforcement of foreign \narbitral awards, cross-border mediated settlement agreements, and foreign judgments. \n \n6.  Adjudication of environmental and climate change disputes. ADB DMCs have been \nprioritizing environmental protection and climate change issues as crucial development goals. \nThey have established policies and enacted new or updated laws to address environmental \nissues, and more recently with the adoption of the Paris Agreement, to address climate change \nissues. Nevertheless, implementation and enforcement are weak and delayed. As a result, people \nhave been increasingly turning to the courts to hold their governments and the private sector \naccountable.9 \n \n7.  Many judiciaries in ADB\u2019s DMCs face enormous challenges in adjudicating these highly \ncomplex and technical cases, which require them to balance economic, environmental, social, \nand cultural considerations and to devise appropriate and innovative remedies and damages. 10 \nSince 2010, ADB has been providing capacity building in adjudicating environmental disputes to \njudiciaries in South Ais and Southeast Asia, and, since 2018, providing capacity building in \nadjudicating climate change cases to judiciaries in South Asia, Southeast Asia and Pacific DMCs. \nADB\u2019s sustained engagement has resulted in improved jurisprudence; the institutionalization of \ncurricula in judicial academies; the establishment of green benches, e.g., Bhutan, Malaysia and \nPakistan; the development of special rules of procedure for environmental cases, e.g., Bhutan \nand Philippines; and the creation of the Asian Judges Network on Environment (AJNE) which is \nsupported by chief justices and high court judges from over 30 DMCs. \n \n8.  Despite these advances, judiciaries have called for ADB\u2019s continuing support for capacity \nbuilding programs, as well as the development of more targeted knowledge resources, e.g., on a \nparticular issue such as remedies or on a specific issue relevant to a particular subregion. \nAdditionally, judiciaries have requested greater access to case law or judgements from other \njurisdictions and peer learning opportunities especially in adjudicating environmental and climate \nchange cases with a transnational element. Moreover, there are certain DMCs such as Papua \nNew Guinea and Thailand, looking to set up a separate environmental court and need assistance \nwith its establishment, as well as related court procedures and training of specialized judges. \n \n7  Courts are faced with conflict of laws and jurisdictional issues which have taken on a new level of complexity and \nintensity. Additionally, judges can benefit from learning more about international conventions as disputes are \nincreasingly subject to treaties, as well as international best practices.  \n8   Numerous sources have projected that insolvencies will increase because of COVID-19. International Development \nLaw Organization. Insolvency and COVID-19: A Crisis within a Crisis. \n9   For example, they have turned to the courts to ensure that governments implement or prepare appropriate climate \nresponses. Additionally, rights-based lawsuits based on constitutional rights have been growing in these countries. \nADB. 2020. Climate Change, Coming Soon to a Court Near You: Climate Litigation in Asia and the Pacific and \nBeyond. Manila. \n10 Many judges were not taught environmental and climate change laws in law school since these courses did not exist \nand they handle mainstream areas of law (e.g., civil, criminal and commercial law) but are now asked to hear \nenvironmental and emerging climate change cases. \n ", "3 \n9.  Virtual adjudication best practices to increase access to justice. Due to the COVID-\n19 pandemic, courts were forced to shut down and judiciaries had to rapidly introduce and adapt \nto various forms of remote hearings. Divergent practices and standards have been developed \namong the judiciaries in ADB DMCs, creating various access to justice issues such as ensuring \nimpartiality, fairness and transparency. Additionally, many judges have found the transition from \nphysical to remote hearings challenging. As courts continue their digitalization efforts which trend \nwill continue beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a need to include virtual adjudication best \npractices including discussions on which cases or hearings are best suited for remote hearings, \nas well as increase the digital literacy of judges as part of the judicial capacity building programs.11 \n \n10.  Benefits of judicial capacity building. Judicial capacity building programs play an \nessential role in administering justice, and effectively and efficiently resolving disputes with \nenormous development impacts. Studies have shown that capacity building of judges facilitates \nthe prompt resolution of disputes and can lead to higher quality judicial decisions.12 Capacity \nbuilding can also foster greater uniformity and predictability of decisions, and can increase public \nconfidence in the judicial system\u2019s ability to deal effectively with specialized matters. Judiciaries \nwith greater capacity can help maintain the rule of law through enduring principles and predictable \nprocesses, while also responding to a rapidly changing society. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: strengthened rule of law through independent, \nimpartial, and skilled judiciaries (ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 OP 3, OP 6, OP 7; and SDGs 13 and 16, \nParis Agreement). The TA will have the following outcome: improved capacity of judiciaries in \nadjudicating commercial and environmental and climate change disputes.13 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n12.  The outputs of the TA are described in paras. 13\u201315. 14 \n \n13.  Output  1:  Judicial  capacity  building  programs  and  knowledge  resources  on \nadjudication of commercial disputes developed. This output will deliver commercial law \njudicial capacity building in DMCs where substantial reform efforts are taking place to improve the \nbusiness climate. In particular, it will help build on and implement business law reforms supported \nunder ADB policy-based loans and TA, e.g., in Fiji, Palau, Papua New Guinea, and Uzbekistan \nwhere ADB has been assisting with international arbitration law reform; and in Armenia, Indonesia, \nand Myanmar where ADB has been supporting insolvency law reform. The output will (i) organize \nfocus group discussions with judges, lawyers, businesses, and other stakeholders to assess \njudicial knowledge and skills gaps; (ii) conduct a needs assessment on capacity and institutional \nmechanisms  for  handling  commercial  disputes  in  the  relevant  courts  for  discussion  with \nimplementing  agencies;  (iii)  design  and  deliver  tailored  commercial  law  capacity  building \n \n11   R.

Output  2:  Judicial  capacity  building  programs  and  knowledge  resources  on \nadjudication of environmental and climate change disputes developed. This output will build \non the gains achieved under ADB\u2019s environmental and climate change judicial capacity programs \nimplemented in South Asia, Southeast Asia and Pacific DMCs (footnote 2). 16 It will (i) conduct a \nnew  or  updated  needs  assessment  on  capacity  and  institutional  mechanisms  for  handling \nenvironmental and climate change disputes, and discuss the findings with the implementing \nagencies;  (ii)  design  and  deliver  tailored  capacity  building  programs  in  relevant  areas  of \nenvironmental, climate change, and other sustainable development issues, including on internally \naccepted  principles  and  standards,  effective  judgment  writing  and  virtual  adjudication  best \npractices (footnote 15); and (iii) develop targeted knowledge resources on specific issues such \nas remedies or issues relevant to a particular subregion such as the Greater Mekong Subregion. \nAdditionally, if requested, assistance can be provided in the establishment of green benches or \nspecialized  environmental  courts  and  the  development  of  special  rules  of  procedure  for \nenvironmental and/or climate change cases. \n \n15.  Output 3: Regional knowledge sharing and cooperation strengthened. The judicial \ncapacity building programs will be further reinforced through the mutual exchange and cross-\npollination of best practices among the judiciaries and the judicial learning bodies of ADB DMCs. \nMoreover, the TA will work with regional  organizations such as the Asia-Pacific Economic \nCooperation,  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations,  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic \nCooperation Program and/or South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation to institutionalize \nthe capacity building programs and support regional knowledge sharing.17 This output will (i) \nconvene regional conferences in specialized areas of the law, as well as connect judiciaries with \nexperts in related fields; (ii) produce knowledge products derived from the regional conference; \n(iii) leverage judicial networks to bring judges together in a smaller format to discuss common \nissues; (iv) build on existing regional judicial networks and knowledge platforms such AJNE, in \nparticular, in increasing greater access to regional case law or court judgements; and (v) link \njudiciaries to international judicial networks such as GJIE and International Association of Women \nJudges. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund ($850,000 TASF-6 and $150,000 TASF-other sources).18 The \nkey expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \n15 The design, duration, and schedule of each judicial capacity building program will be discussed and agreed with the \nimplementing agencies; and will vary according to each participating DMC. Additionally, on a pilot basis, a group of \njudges can be supported to become trainers under a train-the-trainers model to deliver trainings to other judges. \n16   ADB\u2019s Central and West DMCs will be eligible to request assistance under Output 2, however, based on research, \nthere is no reported environmental or climate change litigation (except Pakistan). Nevertheless, the lack of reported \ncases does not mean the region has no environmental or climate change cases. It is more likely that environmental \nand climate change litigation is minimal or nascent in these jurisdictions. \n17 For example, the TA can work with the Council of ASEAN Chief Justices Working Group on Judicial Education and \nTraining. \n18 It  is  anticipated  that  additional funds  will  be  required  based  on  initial  requests from  DMCs and  a  4-year \nimplementation period. Additional funding opportunities will be sought from other special funds and trust funds, \nincluding the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund, which has been informed of the TA. \n ", "5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ADB, through the Office of the General Counsel\u2019s Law and Policy Reform Program, will \nbe the executing agency and administer the TA. Implementing agencies will be the supreme \ncourts, judicial academies, and judicial schools; and relevant ministries such as the ministries of \njustice. Target DMCs will be identified in consultation with relevant ADB regional departments, \nthe Private Sector Operations Department, the Office of Public\u2013Private Partnership, and sector \nand thematic groups.19 Additionally, ADB will collaborate with development partners\u2014such as the \nUnited  Nations  Commission  on  International  Trade  Law;  the  International  Association  of \nRestructuring, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Professionals; the International Development Law \nOrganization; the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development; the United States Agency \nfor  International  Development;  the  International  Association  of  Women  Judges;  the  United \nNations Environment Programme; and the GJIE\u2014in delivering the capacity building programs, \nconvening  knowledge  sharing  events,  and  disseminating  knowledge  products.
