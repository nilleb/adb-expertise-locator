INTRODUCTION \n1.  Under  its  Strategy  2020,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  identified \nenvironmentally sustainable growth as a top development concern and has made environment, \nincluding climate change, a core area of operations.1 Consistent with the agreements under the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), including the Bali Action \nPlan, ADB\u2019s climate change priorities for action,2 adopted in 2010, emphasize the use of finance, \ntechnology, and capacity building as tools to address climate change. Enabling the transfer and \nspread of technology is, therefore, central to the global effort to combat climate change and a \nmeans to help developing countries address both climate change and energy security.3 \n \n2.  The  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  seek  to  pilot  a  center  that  will  help \ncoordinate assistance in Asia and the Pacific to accelerate the development and deployment of \nclimate change mitigation and adaptation technologies. The center will support the aims and \nactivities of the Technology Mechanism established under the UNFCCC. The project will be \nundertaken jointly with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and other partners, \nwith funding support expected from the Global Environment Facility (GEF).4 This TA will serve \nas the vehicle to implement the project components that are to be conducted by ADB. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Global climate change poses increasingly important challenges for developing countries \nin the Asia and Pacific region. The region\u2019s rapid economic growth and structural change have \nbeen closely associated with the worldwide rise in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Emissions \nfrom its energy sector, for example, have grown by 194% since 1990. If this trend is allowed to \ncontinue, the region could account for 45% of global energy emissions by 2030 from 33% in \n2008.6 The region\u2019s response to climate change could make or break global mitigation efforts. At \nthe same time, Asia and the Pacific are particularly vulnerable to global warming\u2019s adverse \neffects. The region is expected to face increasingly frequent and severe  extreme weather \nevents,  including  floods,  droughts,  and  tropical  storms,  as  well  as  rising  sea  levels  and \nunpredictable changes in precipitation patterns. This may reduce the availability of freshwater, \nlead to falling crop and fisheries productivity, and increase the occurrence of diseases such as \ndengue fever and malaria. Large population centers, industrial areas, and key infrastructure that \nare located in vulnerable geographical areas may be put at risk. These impacts would seriously \nthreaten the livelihoods of large populations, particularly vulnerable groups such as women and \nchildren, and undermine economic growth and poverty reduction efforts across the region. \n \n4.  A key tool for addressing both rising emissions and vulnerability to climate change is the \neffective development, transfer, and deployment of technologies. The 16th Conference of the \nParties  to  the  UNFCCC  in  Cancun,  Mexico  in  December  2010  reached  an  agreement  to \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n2  ADB.  2010. Addressing Climate Change in Asia and the Pacific: Priorities for Action. Manila. \n3  ADB\u2019s regional departments have formulated climate change implementation plans, and actions to address climate \nchange priorities in a number of country partnership strategies such as those for Bangladesh and Nepal. \n4  The joint concept proposal by ADB and UNEP entitled Pilot Asia-Pacific Climate Technology Network and Finance \nCenter was approved by the GEF Council and Special Climate Change Fund Council in May 2011 with a total \nallocation of $12 million. Final approval of $7.66 million in project grant to be allocated to ADB is expected in the \nthird quarter of 2011. \n5 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 18 July 2011. \n6  International Energy Agency. 2010. World Energy Outlook 2010. Paris. \n ", "2   \nestablish a global Technology Mechanism to facilitate the implementation of actions to achieve \ntechnology  development  and  transfer  based  on  national  circumstances  and  priorities.  The \nParties agreed to create a Technology Executive Committee and a Climate Technology Center \nand  Network  under  this  mechanism.  Many  of  the  Parties  saw  regional  organizations  as \nimportant conduits between the global center and a network of participants scattered across \ncountries and regions. The Parties also emphasized the importance of creating a strong linkage \nbetween the UNFCCC's Technology and Financial Mechanisms. As a regional development \nbank in Asia and the Pacific, ADB has much to contribute to this global effort. \n \n5.  The  opportunity  to  generate  benefits  from  new  technological  tools  is  especially \nsignificant in developing countries where rapid expansion of relatively long-lived capital stocks \nusing incumbent technologies threatens to lock in GHG emission patterns for decades to come. \nNew technology is also needed to adapt to the adverse impacts that are bound to occur due to \nexisting  levels  of  GHG  concentration  in  the  atmosphere.  These  tools  include  better  water \ntreatment  and  supply  technology,  improved  crop  varieties,  and  better  technologies  for \nagricultural water management and flood protection. Public financial resources alone will not \nmeet the large-scale overall investment needs of low-carbon, climate-resilient development. \nThese  requirements  are  expected  to  reach  $140  billion\u2013$175  billion  a  year  by  2030  for \nmitigation  in  the  world\u2019s  developing  countries,7 and  $40  billion  annually  for  adaptation  in \ndeveloping  countries  of  Asia  and  the  Pacific  alone.8 Successful  wide-scale  deployment  of \nclimate technologies will require that limited public sector funds be used to leverage far greater \namounts of private capital. This will demand the development of financial mechanisms that can \novercome additional risks associated with the new technologies and broader policy frameworks \nthat can support climate technology transfer and diffusion. \n \n6.  Enabling public and private sector investments in climate technology will also require the \nstrengthening  of  institutional  and  human  capabilities.  Financial  and  planning  policy  at  the \nnational and institutional levels will need to incorporate climate technology considerations and \ndevelop policies to encourage technology uptake. For example, price support mechanisms, \nsuch  as  feed-in  tariffs  for  renewable  energy  generation,  will  need  to  be  developed  and \nassessments  of  climate  technology  needs  will  have  to  be  incorporated  into  development \nplanning. Institutional mechanisms will also be required to better disseminate information on \navailable climate technologies and potential financing to key stakeholders in both the public and \nprivate sectors and to facilitate transactions between willing buyers and sellers of technologies. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n7.  The TA, as part of a broader UNEP\u2013ADB project, will pilot a center for the deployment of \nclimate mitigation and adaptation technologies. The center will help fulfill the objectives of the \nTechnology Mechanism established under the UNFCCC. The five subprojects of this TA will \ncombine  with  UNEP\u2019s  components9 to  constitute  a  cohesive  program  to  promote  climate \ntechnology  transfer  and  deployment  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific.  The  lessons  learned  and \ninstitutional capabilities generated through this program can inform and feed into nascent plans \n                                                \n7  International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and World Bank. 2010. World Development Report 2010. \nWashington, DC. \n8  International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and World Bank. 2010. Economics of Adaptation to \nClimate Change (Synthesis Report). Washington, DC. \n9  Proposed  UNEP  components  focus  on  upstream  TA  for  technology  transfer  and  deployment  including  the \ndevelopment and strengthening of networks and institutions, and the creation of enabling policies. Proposed ADB \ncomponents follow on from these supporting technology transfer and deployment through the mobilization of \nfinancial resources. \n ", "3 \n \nfor operationalizing the Technology Mechanism, the details of which are still being negotiated. \nThis will also enable ADB to align its existing and future operations in technology development \nand transfer as closely as possible with the considerations of the global community and allow \nADB to respond quickly to the outcomes of UNFCCC negotiations while delivering its support to \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) without delay.   \n \n8.  The cluster approach is proposed because (i) the subprojects are closely related, with \ncommon objectives and significant potential synergies, (ii) they will operate collectively as a pilot \ntechnology finance center to contribute to the Climate Technology Center and Network under \nclimate change negotiations, and (iii) a cluster modality will mobilize financing better than an \nindividual TA approach. Locating all five pilot center subprojects at ADB headquarters will also \nmaximize TA coherence and coordination. The interlinked subprojects address the crosscutting \nissues  surrounding  climate  technology  transfer  identified  in  paras.  4\u20136.  These  are  the \ndevelopment of mechanisms and policies to facilitate technology transfer, the mobilization of \nfinancial resources for climate technologies, and the development of human and institutional \ncapacity for technology transfer. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The overall impact of the TA will be the enhanced diffusion of technologies that promote \nlow-carbon and climate-resilient development in Asia and the Pacific. The expected outcome \nwill be increased investments in technologies that address climate mitigation and adaptation.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will seek on a pilot basis to establish a dedicated team of experts to help \nfacilitate  investments  in  climate  technology.  This  pilot  center  will  offer  a  range  of  support \nservices that will be available on demand to DMC governments, the private sector, and other \nstakeholders. The center will build upon technology initiatives conducted both within and outside \nUNFCCC  frameworks.  The  services  it  will  offer  will  facilitate  direct  investment  in  climate \ntechnology as well as help develop the frameworks needed to generate these investments. At \nthe  country  level,  this  will  lead  to  better  policy  frameworks  to  support  climate  technology \nadoption  and,  at  the  project  level,  greater  investment  in  climate  technology  projects. \nImplementation  will  vary  between  subprojects;  therefore,  participating  DMCs  and  other \nstakeholders will be selected at the subproject level. To cover a broad portfolio of technologies \nand gain  wide  experience, the  project  and  pilot  center  activities  will  look for  balance  and \ndiversity in geography and country income in deciding country beneficiaries. The criteria for \ncountry participation will be finalized during the initial stages of TA implementation. \n \n11.  Subproject  A: Integration  of  climate  technology  financing  needs  into  national \ndevelopment strategies, plans, and investment priorities. This subproject will incorporate \nclimate  technology  considerations  into  the  ADB  country  partnership  strategy  and  country \noperation business plan processes. This will result in investment plans that are cleaner and \nmore resilient environmentally. It will also promote the consideration of climate technology \ntransfer  and  diffusion  in  national  development  planning  and  policymaking.  Capacity \ndevelopment within the finance, investment, and other government agencies of DMCs will be an \nimportant means of ensuring the strategic impact of the TA, which will include government and \nother stakeholder consultations in planning processes. \n \n \n ", "4   \n12.  Subproject  B:  Promotion  of  direct  investment  in  priority  climate  technology \nprojects. Projects using new climate technologies face greater technology risks and higher \nlevels of investor uncertainty than incumbent technologies, as well as the resulting higher \nfinancing costs. This subproject will facilitate project finance for climate technology transfer by \nsupporting  the  use  of  innovative  technologies  in  ADB  pipeline  investment  projects.  The \nsubproject will offer specialist technical support for activities such as alternative technology \nanalysis in identified priority technology areas. \n \n13.  Subproject C: Promotion of investment in climate technology products through \nventure capital funds. This subproject will help catalyze increased levels of investment in \nclimate technologies by providing technical support to venture capital funds so that they can \nallocate more resources to companies with climate technology products.  As a part of ADB\u2019s \nAsia Climate Change and Clean Energy Venture Capital Initiative, this subproject will retain a \npool  of  experts  to  identify,  evaluate,  and  provide  advice  on  climate  technology  from  the \ntechnological, investment, and intellectual property rights perspectives.10 \n \n14.  Subproject D: Demonstration of an assisted broker model for transfer of low-\ncarbon technologies to Asia and the Pacific. This subproject will address the lack of a well-\ninformed market for technology transfer transactions and demonstrate an assisted broker model \nfor  transfer  of  low-carbon  technologies.  This  model  will  operate  as  a  marketplace  or \nmatchmaking mechanism. It will work to bring together willing low-carbon technology providers \nand  recipients  and  help  facilitate  technology  transfer.  It  will  lead  the  way  toward  the \nestablishment of a full-fledged business for the transfer of low-carbon technologies in Asia and \nthe Pacific that can be replicated in other regions. \n \n15.  Subproject  E:  Project  management.  ADB will retain a core team to manage and \ncoordinate the implementation of TA activities. The subproject will also review the scope and \nmodality of the pilot center and make recomendations for its future. The core team will consist of \nmanagement level staff, technical staff, secondees, and consultants with climate change-related \nexpertise. The team will regularly communicate with the subproject teams, GEF, and other \npartners; organize meetings; and prepare reports required by ADB and partners. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The estimated total cost of the TA is $20.30 million. It breaks down as follows: (i) \nsubproject A, $1.50 million; (ii) subproject B, $1.50 million; (iii) subproject C, $9 million; (iv) \nsubproject D, $8 million; and (v) subproject E, $0.30 million. Of the aggregate cost, $15.05 \nmillion will be financed by grants of (i) $2.85 million from ADB\u2019s Climate Change Fund;11 (ii) \n$842,000 from  ADB\u2019s Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund (TASF-other  sources); (iii)  $3.50 \nmillion from the Asian Clean Energy Fund,12 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership \nFacility and administered by ADB; (iv) $200,000 from VITO-Flemish Institute for Technological \nResearch NV, to be administered by ADB; and (v) $7,659,091 from the GEF, to be administered \nby ADB. Funding sources for the remaining $5.25 million have yet to be identified. The cost \nestimates and financing plans are in Appendix 2. \n                                                \n10ADB\u2019s Asia Climate Change and Clean Energy Venture Capital Initiative seeks to provide equity \ninvestment and advisory assistance to venture capital funds targeting early stage companies with \nclimate technology products as a means to enhance the availability and affordability of these products \nin developing countries of Asia and the Pacific.   \n11 Established by ADB. \n12 Established by the Government of Japan. \n ", "5 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB  will  coordinate  the  TA  through  its  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development \nDepartment  (RSDD).    Upon  TA  approval,  the  subproject  proposals  will  be  submitted  for \napproval to the director general of the RSDD, in accordance with ADB guidelines on cluster TA \nprocessing.13 ADB will be the executing agency and implementing agency for each subproject. \nThe cluster TA will have a steering committee of representatives of the GEF secretariat, ADB, \nand UNEP, and other experts as needed to provide overall guidance. ADB will coordinate the \nactivities  and  chair  the  steering  committee.  Separate  advisory  committees  will  also  be \nestablished when deemed necessary to oversee the implementation of the  subprojects. These \nadvisory committees will comprise ADB staff and representatives of major donors and resource \npersons. \n \n18.  The TA will coordinate its activities with other ongoing ADB projects through existing \ninstitutional arrangements such as the RSDD Climate Change Program Coordination Unit, the \nAdaptation and Land-Use Working Group, and the Clean Energy Working Group. Regional \ndepartment focal points will also be invited to contribute to the pilot center to avoid duplication of \nefforts.  The  center  will  work  closely  with  the  DMCs,  in  coordination  with  the  regional \ndepartments, and hold workshops to share knowledge across countries and regions. The TA is \nto be implemented from October 2011 to September 2014. \n \n19.  The TA will require national consulting inputs between 290 and 360 person-months and \ninternational consulting inputs between 740 and 820 person-months. Consulting inputs will be \nrequired from both firms and individuals.  All consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance \nwith its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Because \nthis is a cluster TA, different methods of consultant selection will apply, depending on the size \nand nature of the contracts. The outline terms of reference for consultants for subprojects are in \nAppendix 3.  All procurement of goods and other services under the TA will be performed in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Upon \ncompletion of the cluster TA, all equipment procured by the consultants under the TA will be \nturned over to ADB. Disbursements under the TA will be performed in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION AND DECISION \n20.  The President recommends that the Board approve (i) ADB administering a portion of \ntechnical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $7,659,091 to be financed on a grant basis \nby the Global Environment Facility; (ii) ADB administering a portion of technical assistance not \nexceeding the equivalent of $3,500,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the Asian Clean \nEnergy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility; and (iii) ADB providing a \nportion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $3,692,000 on a grant basis, for \nEstablishing a Pilot Center to Facilitate Climate Technology Investments in Asia and the Pacific.  \nIf the Board approves ADB administering the technical assistance, the President, acting under \nthe authority delegated by the Board, will approve ADB administering a portion of technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $200,000 to be financed on a grant basis by VITO- \nFlemish Institute for Technological Research NV for Establishing a Pilot Center to Facilitate \nClimate Technology Investments in Asia and the Pacific. \n                                                \n13 ADB. 2011.
