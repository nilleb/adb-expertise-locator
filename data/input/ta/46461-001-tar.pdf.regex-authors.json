The Union Cabinet, Government of India, endorsed the establishment of the National \nSkill Development Agency (NSDA) on 9 May 2013 as the apex body for coordinating and \nharmonizing the skill development efforts of the Government and the private sector to achieve \nthe skilling targets of the 12th Five Year Plan of India and beyond. NSDA is positioned under the \nDepartment of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Government of India, which is responsible \nfor providing planning, logistics, and budgetary support to it. In view of this challenging mandate \nand the need for NSDA to coordinate and guide the skill development efforts across the national \nand state levels, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) was requested to provide capacity building \ntechnical assistance (TA). Accordingly, consultations were held with senior NSDA officials in \nJuly 2013 to build on earlier discussions held in March 2013 and June 2012. This TA also \nreflects  ongoing  discussions  with  other  relevant  stakeholders  including  the  National  Skill \nDevelopment Corporation, skill development missions of states such as Karnataka, Kerala, \nMeghalaya,  Rajasthan,  and  private  and  public  skills  training  providers.  The  Design  and \nMonitoring Framework is in Appendix 1.1   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The low employability of youth is one of the main factors hampering India\u2019s efforts \ntowards facilitating inclusive growth. More than 50% of India\u2019s population of 1.3 billion is below \n25 years of age, and about 65% is below 35 years of age. India\u2019s working age population (aged \n15\u201359 years) numbers 431 million; 29% are illiterate, and 24% have a primary-level education, \nor below. Only 17% of the labor force is educated to the senior secondary level (grades 11 and \n12) or higher (including diplomas, graduates, and above). It is estimated that 57% of India\u2019s \nyouth suffer from some degree of unemployability.2 Surveys show that only 30% of India\u2019s \ninformation technology graduates, 25% of engineering graduates, and 15% of finance and \naccounting  professionals  are  suitable  for  employment.3 Most  companies  invest  substantial \nresources retraining new recruits, adding to their costs and reducing competitiveness. This \nposes a major constraint, both for Indian companies and companies from developed countries \neager to expand investment in India.   \n \n3.   While nearly 13 million new workers join the labor force each year, India has the \ncapacity to provide skills training for only 5 million annually. These training programs have \nlimited  reach,  and  the  quality  is  often  poor.  Training  facilities  and  programs  need  to  be \nupgraded and aligned more closely with India\u2019s emerging labor market needs and changing \neconomic  structure.  The  skills  development  initiatives  of  the  Government  of  India  are \nfragmented  across  21  line  ministries  (e.g.,  Labor  and  Employment;  Human  Resource \nDevelopment;  Rural  Development;  Micro,  Small,  and  Medium  Industries;  Industries  and \nCommerce; Power; and Textiles) leading to duplication of effort and wasted resources. Most of \nthe government-sponsored training programs do not respond adequately to the private sector\u2019s \nevolving needs. Moreover, it is difficult to tailor these centrally-driven programs to meet the \nspecific needs and constraints of the different states of India which are fairly diverse.   \n \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 31 October 2013.  \n2   TeamLease  Services  Private  Ltd.  2007.

The  establishment  of  the  National  Skill  Development  Agency  (NSDA)  as  the  apex \nautonomous coordinating body for skills development programs is therefore, a step in the right \ndirection.4 NSDA subsumes the Prime Minister\u2019s National Council on Skill Development, the \nNational Skill Development Coordination Board, and the Office of the Adviser to the Prime \nMinister  on  Skill  Development.      It  will  help  to  improve  the  coordination  across  the  skill \ndevelopment programs driven by different ministries at the central level,  guide the (largely \nnascent) state skill development missions (SSDMs) including through analytical advice (e.g., \nbenchmarking surveys, tracer studies, and preparation of the required training manuals), and \nassist in strengthening India\u2019s skills ecosystem.  \n \n5.  Since NSDA has been established only recently, it currently has a small team of 7 \nconsultants and 2 research assistants to help the senior management. It will find it difficult to \ncoordinate the skill development efforts across the national and state levels, and to ensure \nconvergence across the public and private sectors in terms of the NSQF. It has therefore, \nrequested additional help from ADB to draw on its experience within and outside India in the \nform of best practice, and to provide and guide experienced resource persons and a consulting \nfirm so that it can start working towards delivering its mandate.  \n \n6.  The TA will assist in strengthening the capacity of NSDA so that it can deliver its \nchallenging mandate of: \n(i)  coordinating the skills development efforts of the government at the national level \n(through ministries) and state level (through SSDMs), to ensure convergence, \nreduce duplication of effort, and maximize the use of resources;  \n(ii)  anchoring  and  operationalizing  the  National  Skills  Qualifications  Framework \n(NSQF);5  \n(iii)  evaluating  the  effectiveness  of  existing  skills  development  schemes  and \nsuggesting corrective actions to increase their effectiveness; and \n(iv)  mobilizing  financial  resources,  including  from  development  partners,  and \nchannelling funding to national and state level programs in a way that ensures \nthat the goals of the Twelfth Five Year Plan, 2013\u20132018, and future plans are \nmet.6    \n \n7.  The proposed TA is in line with the country partnership strategy, 2013\u20132017 for India, \nwhich  aims  to  support  India\u2019s  efforts  toward  inclusive  growth,  and  the  country  operations \nbusiness plan, 2013\u20132015 for India, which recognizes education as a new sector in Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) operations in India.7 The project is fully aligned with Strategy 2020.8  \n                                                \n4   The Union Cabinet, Government of India, endorsed the establishment of the NSDA on 9 May 2013. The NSDA was \nnotified on 7 June 2013. \n5  In 2013, the Ministry of Labor and Employment and the Ministry of Human Resources Development agreed to \nmerge their certification standards to form the NSQF. This will bring together the formerly separate general \neducation and vocational education qualification frameworks. NSQF will determine the qualification parameters for \nindustry sectors by establishing benchmarks for credit accumulation based on learning hours and required level of \ncompetency. It allows for the award of dual certificates by the sector skill councils and education boards working \nunder the general qualifications framework. Sector skill councils have been mandated to develop the curriculum \nand training manuals and provide certification at different levels, depending on the level of training.  \n6  Government of India, Planning Commission. 2013.

The impact of the TA will be improved coordination and quality of skills development \nprograms at the central and state levels. The outcome will be enhanced capacity of NSDA for \nquality skills development across central ministries, states, and the private sector. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The  TA  will  work  towards  achieving  this  outcome  by  supporting  the  following  five \noutputs: \n(i)   National Skills Qualifications Framework operationalized. The TA will help \nNSDA in aligning the NSQF with the established education system in selected \nstates and focus on priority sectors and trades to meet the training targets. It will \nfacilitate  quality  assurance  through  the  identification  of  job  roles  and \ndevelopment of national occupational standards and competency frameworks. \nKey areas include facilitation and capacity development of selected SSDMs, \nconduct of input\u2013output\u2013outcome studies to understand the linkages between \ntraining inputs and the remuneration earned by men and women, and monitoring \nand evaluation (M&E). The TA will help design a tracking system that will identify \ncertified and affiliated skills providers, and build their capacity to conduct NSQF-\naligned  vocational  programs  at  higher  skills  levels,  in  partnership  with \neducational institutes. The TA will also promote partnership between NSDA and \nindustrial  houses  and/or  business  associations  to  ensure  the  placement  of \nstudents  trained  and  certified  under  the  NSQF.  It  will  also  assist  NSDA  in \nundertaking dialogue with  employment exchanges, career counseling bodies, \nand placement agencies in selected states so that they are more effective in \nhelping youth access suitable jobs.   \n(ii)  Capacity development program for skills development implemented. The \nTA will help NSDA in preparing capacity-building and training manuals covering \nvarious areas\u2014such as financial due diligence and tracking of skills training \nproviders, financial management and governance of SSDMs, and procurement\u2014\nwhich can be used by all SSDMs.  \n(iii)   Knowledge sharing on skills development facilitated. The TA will facilitate \ncross-learning through workshops and interactions between different SSDMs, \nministries, and private skills providers. Reports will be prepared on approaches \nand initiatives of different SSDMs. NSDA will undertake M&E of selected central \nand state skill development programs to assess their effectiveness and results. \nLessons will inform the design and implementation of future projects, thereby \nreducing waste. Depending on the needs of the SSDMs, short studies drawing \non relevant best practice (international and national) will also be prepared.  \n(iv)   Partnership with international vocational development agencies facilitated. \nThe  TA  will  facilitate  closer  engagement  between  NSDA  and  vocational \ndevelopment agencies in developed countries that have growing investment in \nIndia. For example, the TA could fund a visit by staff of the Japan Vocational \nDevelopment Agency  to Delhi and selected Indian states to enable them to \nengage with NSDA and other relevant agencies. A study tour to Japan by key \nIndian policymakers (maximum of five) can be supported under the TA, to enable \npolicymakers to learn from the vocational training system of a developed country, \n ", "4   \nand to apply the best practices in India as required. \n(v)   Improved project management. This will cover basic implementation activities \nsuch  as  hiring  and  guiding  qualified  consultants  (firm  and  individuals), \nundertaking inception and review missions, engaging with key stakeholders, and \nensuring that overall TA implementation remains on track.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.75 million, of which $1.5 million will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  and  administered  by  ADB.  The \ngovernment  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  office  accommodation  and \ntransportation, remuneration and per diem of counterpart staff, and other in-kind contributions. \nThe cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n11.    The Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, will be the executing agency \nfor this TA. NSDA will be the implementing agency.  \n \n12.  A total of 104 person-months of consulting inputs will be provided under the TA: 18 \nperson-months of international and 86 person-months of national consultant services. ADB will \nengage four individual consultants (for 30 person-months) as well as a firm (for 74 person-\nmonths).  The  selection  and  engagement  of  the  consulting  inputs  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime). The consulting firm will be selected on the basis of a full technical proposal in accordance \nwith  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedures.  A quality  to  cost  ratio  of  90:10  will  be \nfollowed. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. All disbursements \nunder  the  TA  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). All TA-financed goods and equipment such as \ncomputers, fax machine, multimedia projector, photocopier, printer, and other required items will \nbe procured in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to \ntime). The procured equipment will be handed over to NSDA upon TA completion.  \n \n13.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months with expected commencement in April 2014 \nand completion in April 2016. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n14.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,500,000  to  the \nGovernment of India to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction \nfor Capacity Building of the National Skill Development Agency, and hereby reports this action \nto the Board. \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nSummary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact  By the end of 2020    Assumption \n  (i)    Annual reports of the  Close coordination \nImproved  All skills development  NSDA, NSDC, and the  between the Ministry of \ncoordination and  programs aligned with NSQF  Ministry of Labor and  Labor and Employment, \nquality of skills  quality and standards  Employment  Ministry of Human \ndevelopment      Resource Development, \nprograms at the      NSDC and the NSDA \ncentral and state       \nlevels  Risk \nDelays in getting \nconsensus on NSQF \namong the states \nOutcome  By April 2016  For all indicators:  Assumption \n       \nEnhanced  (i) NSDA\u2019s governance  Annual reports of the  State educational and \ncapacity of NSDA  framework in place  NSDA, NSDC, and the  training institutes agree \nfor quality skills    Ministry of Labor and  to implement the NSQF \ndevelopment  (ii) SSDMs in six states made  Employment  model of operations   \nacross central  fully operational with support     \nministries, states,  from NSDA  Annual reports of the six \nand the private    SSDMs \nsector         \n           \nOutputs   By April 2016    Risk \n       \n1.
