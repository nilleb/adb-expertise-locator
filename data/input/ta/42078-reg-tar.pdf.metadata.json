The Pacific region is highly dependent on imported petroleum for its commercial energy \nrequirements\u2014petroleum imports account for well over 90% of those requirements overall\u2014and \nis extremely vulnerable to the negative impact of the international energy market. The Pacific \nisland countries (PICs) are among the world\u2019s smallest and most remote states, and generally \nhave  isolated  populations  living  in  very  low  concentrations.  Despite  the  region\u2019s  high \ndependence on key international markets for imports and exports, its economic connections \nwith those markets are thin and subject to disruption, and result in a high cost of living and steep \nchallenges to development. \n \n2.  In a consultation process conducted in 2007 on behalf of the Global Environment Facility \n(GEF) Pacific Alliance for Sustainability, four PICs (Cook Islands, Samoa, Tonga, and Vanuatu) \nexpressed keen interest and assigned high priority to reducing their consumption of fossil fuels. \nSimilar interest and priority were expressed by Papua New Guinea (PNG). A Fact-Finding \nMission of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to these PICs and to the Fiji Islands1 discussed \nthe regional technical assistance (RETA) Promoting Energy Efficiency Project for the Pacific. An \nunderstanding was reached with the governments of the selected PICs on the purpose, key \nactivities, cost estimates and financing, and implementation arrangements of the RETA. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is presented in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Two negative effects of fossil fuel use are keenly felt throughout the region. First, the \nunprecedented high cost of petroleum fuel (crude oil prices were closing well above $100 per \nbarrel in the first months of 2008) places a mounting strain on the PICs\u2019 economies and their \ntrade balances, crowding out other imports and real income through high costs of transport fuel \nand electricity, and thereby intensifying poverty. Second, the phenomenon of global warming, \ndriven by fossil fuel combustion worldwide, places the fragile PIC environment in the front line of \nvulnerability to the adverse impact of climate change on water supply, agricultural capacity, \nnatural disasters, and especially the sea level. Pacific leaders recognize that the PICs must take \na strong stand on global climate issues and quickly come to grips with the region\u2019s energy and \nenvironmental vulnerabilities.2 The RETA is designed to address these issues by establishing \nthe policy and regulatory environment, and the institutional and private sector capacity, needed \nto encourage and assist energy end users in reducing wasteful consumption of commercial \nenergy, and thus the financial and environmental costs of the energy sector. \n \n4.  Even with the high cost of energy, commercial demand is expected to increase as PICs \ndevelop and modernize. The region\u2019s high exposure to economic and environmental risk from \ndependence on fuel imports notwithstanding, access to high-quality yet affordable energy is \ncrucial to its development and economic future. The PICs therefore need to ensure that they are \nputting these vital resources to the best possible use. In the long run, the region\u2019s ability to \nafford commercial energy, minimize environmental impact, and offer a credible response to the \nglobal warming issue will depend on its demand-side efficiency, i.e., the extent to which the \nentire region is able to reduce or eliminate wasteful consumption of commercial energy. Energy \nwaste, defined as use that does not appreciably contribute to economic or social well-being, is \nvery high in the PICs for a variety of reasons. These include perverse price signals, policy and \ninstitutional inertia, lack of awareness of consumption and the costs and potentials of energy \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 18 March 2008. \n2  This concern is outlined in the Pacific Plan, approved by PIC leaders in October 2005. \n ", "2 \nconservation among private consumers and governments, lack of well-developed markets for \nenergy service provision or financing, and underdeveloped regulatory capacity in the energy \nsector.  \n \n5.  Efforts to reduce energy imports in the region through alternative energy development \nhave so far had no lasting impact. Through the past three decades, many funding agencies \nhave provided substantial technical and financial support for renewable energy projects, but \nmost  of  these  projects  were  implemented  as  uncoordinated,  top-down,  supply-driven \ndemonstration or pilot projects, with no regard for the underlying institutional and absorption \ncapacity  issues.  Such  issues  include  (i)  insufficient  understanding  and  awareness  of  the \npotentials of energy efficiency among both suppliers and consumers; (ii) inadequate institutional \ncapacity and technical expertise to identify emerging issues in the energy sector and to plan, \nmanage, and sustain effective programs to address them; (iii) absence of a clear market-based \npolicy, legislation, and regulatory framework; and (iv) limited policy commitment and financial \nsupport for the energy sector.  \n \n6.  Current  regional  and  national  energy  initiatives  manifest  a  recognition  shared  by \ndevelopment partners and countries that improving energy sector management and end-use \nefficiency is an urgent priority. For the region to make the best use of the support available, it \nmust adopt appropriate means that harmonize and reinforce synergies among the several \nprograms and eliminate duplication of effort. The success of all energy initiatives requires a \nsustained effort at coordination by the stakeholders that is not limited to information sharing but \nmeaningfully integrates and supports design and implementation activities as well. \n \n7.  In fact, recent regional energy initiatives in the region have increasingly recognized the \nclose relationship between energy management and economic and environmental sustainability, \nand have been supported and complemented by ADB\u2019s interventions in the energy sector. In \n2006, ADB completed TA Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Program for the Pacific \n(REEP),3 providing case studies of renewable energy and energy efficiency potential in the Fiji \nIslands and Samoa. The REEP supported the removal of policy and institutional barriers to \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency, and the promotion of private sector participation in \nenergy management and demand-side services.  \n \n8.  The RETA will build on the results of the REEP (and also take note of the results and \nrecommendations of the Pacific Islands Renewable Energy Program and other initiatives) by \nsupporting  an  appropriate  environment  for  the  development  of  a  demand-driven  and \nprivate sector\u2013based market in energy efficiency services. It will work closely with regional and \ncountry stakeholders and with agencies supporting other regional projects in the sector to \nensure that their needs are met and that the RETA is implemented productively and in harmony \nwith other programs. Its principal outcome will be a reduction in fossil fuel consumption in the \nfive selected PICs, compared with business as usual. The RETA will (i) address the current \ninstitutional,  financial,  regulatory,  and  policy  constraints  on  increasing  energy  efficiency; \n(ii) design an appropriate implementation project in each of the countries that will measurably \nimprove energy efficiency; and (iii) provide models for the rest of the region to follow. \n \n9.  The RETA focus will be on improving the efficiency of energy consumption, rather than \ndeveloping new sources of renewable energy, as a principal means of reducing both the costs \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2003.

Manila \n(TA 6102-REG, approved on 28 April). \n ", "3 \nand the economic and environmental risks of the primary commercial energy supply. The REEP \nand other studies have consistently shown that the return on investment in energy efficiency, \nfrom displaced demand for energy imports, far outweighs that of investment in renewable \nenergy. This point is also underscored in the funding guidelines of GEF-4 (the GEF funding \nprogram for climate change for 2006\u20132010), which reject continued funding of demonstration \nrenewable  energy  projects  because  such  projects  \u201c\u2026have  resulted  in  neither  a  significant \ntake-off  of\u2026markets  [for  off-grid  renewable  energy]  nor  a  meaningful  reduction  in  GHG \n[greenhouse gas] emissions.\u201d4 \n \n10.  The RETA will identify and assist in the implementation of technical assistance (TA) \nprojects in the five participating countries. The RETA will also assist the preparation of an \nenergy efficiency implementation project. Funds for the implementation project will be disbursed \nthrough various means, matching other funds in support of (i) TA with pilot projects, and (ii) \nintegration with ongoing loan and grant projects. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome  \n \n11.  The goal is to improve energy security in the participating PICs (Cook Islands, PNG, \nSamoa, Tonga, and Vanuatu) and develop sound models of energy efficiency policy and project \nimplementation that all the PICs can follow. The RETA will provide direct assistance for the \ndevelopment of the required policy, legal, and institutional framework, and will build a pipeline of \nenergy efficiency assistance projects for funding or cofinancing by ADB, GEF, or other sources. \nThe outcome will be an energy efficiency assistance project or projects, which will fund the \ndevelopment of capabilities and energy efficiency improvements in the industrial, commercial, \nresidential, and public sectors. \n \n12.  Outputs will build on the REEP project (2004\u20132006) and will be closely tailored to \nnational priorities in each of the five PICs. The outputs will include (i) an assessment of the \nenergy efficiency policy and regulatory framework in the Pacific, and a review of all relevant \nongoing and planned assistance projects and loans with which this RETA may enjoy synergies; \n(ii) a recommended energy efficiency policy and regulatory frameworks, including an action plan \nfor the adoption of policies, institutional arrangements, legal and regulatory measures, and \nfinancial schemes (including venture capital), as well as private sector and household incentive \nmechanisms for promoting commercially viable energy efficiency services in the five selected \nPICs;  (iii)  a  recommended  best  way  of  promoting  and  setting  up  a  structured  energy \nmanagement system to sustain energy efficiency initiatives over the long run, including possible \nenergy efficiency services companies; (iv) a training needs analysis and training curricula for \nprivate and public sector key players in the five Pacific developing member countries (PDMCs), \nincluding training services and assistance with regulatory and institutional reform and other \nactivities that will spur the development of a viable market for energy efficiency services in each \ncountry;  (v)  a  pipeline  of  assistance  projects  for  funding  by  ADB,  GEF,  or  other  relevant \nfinancing sources; (vi) a strategy for raising the awareness of and educating the public; and \n(vii) exchange of information and lessons learned among the five countries, and dissemination \nand replication of sound models of energy policy and projects in other countries in the region.  \n \n                                                 \n4  GEF. 2007.

Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  By providing technical support to the national implementing agency and a high-level \nRETA  steering  committee  in  each  of  the  five  PICs,  the  RETA  will  introduce  an  effective \napproach to creating a policy environment that will enable a demand-driven private sector \nmarket for urban energy efficiency services. For this purpose, the RETA will develop local \ncapabilities in the necessary policy, institutional, and legal/regulatory reforms. To keep activities \nfrom overlapping and avoid repeating past mistakes, a comprehensive stocktaking of prior and \nongoing energy efficiency initiatives in the region will be conducted at inception. The RETA will \nclosely coordinate with other ongoing national and regional programs during the design and \nimplementation  period.  The  RETA  implementation  team  will  therefore  have  to  be  closely \ninvolved in regional project coordination efforts. Samoa, which took part in the previous REEP, \nis expected to proceed to implementation somewhat earlier than the other countries. The RETA \nwill generate a pipeline of energy efficiency projects for financing by ADB, GEF, or other \nsources to be implemented even before the end of the RETA.  \n \n14.  The RETA activities will include: (i) reviewing past and ongoing initiatives related to \nenergy efficiency in the region; (ii) developing project selection criteria for each of the five \nparticipating  PDMCs;  (iii)  preparing  a  pipeline  of  energy  efficiency  projects  for  funding  or \ncofinancing by ADB, GEF, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), or other sources, to \nfollow this RETA; (iv) in each participating PIC, supporting the identification of the national \nimplementing agency, the establishment of the RETA steering committee, and the selection of \nthe national technical expert; (v) preparing and agreeing on detailed RETA implementation \nplans and work programs; and (vi) participating proactively in related national and regional \nworkshops to disseminate information pertinent to energy efficiency, exchange good practices \nand analytical work results, and collaborate on specific activities. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,700,000, out of which $1,200,000 is to be \nfinanced with grants from the Clean Energy Fund under the CEFPF5 to be administered by \nADB. The five participating PDMCs will each contribute $100,000 equivalent to finance the costs \nof counterpart staff, office accommodation, communication, local transport, and consultations \nand awareness facilitation. Detailed cost estimates and financing arrangements are presented \nin Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  A no-objection letter will be sought from each of the participating member countries prior \nto implementation of the RETA. ADB will be the Executing Agency for the RETA, which will be \nimplemented by the Pacific Operations Division under ADB\u2019s Pacific Department. ADB\u2019s CEFPF \nsteering committee and working group will provide advisory guidance. A national implementing \nagency will implement TA activities in each participating PIC. The implementing agencies (IAs) \nin the five selected PICs will facilitate the collection of all available relevant information. The \ngovernments  will  help  ensure  adequate  cooperation  from  local  government  bodies  and \nnongovernment organizations active in the power sector. The five IAs will each recruit or appoint \na project manager with qualifications acceptable to ADB. A steering committee in each of the \n                                                 \n5  Contributors: the governments of Australia and Norway. \n ", "5 \nparticipating PICs will give overall guidance. To provide overall supervision and help ensure \nadequate cooperation from the governments and nongovernment organizations as well as from \nusers and beneficiaries, the steering committees should include representatives of the ministries \nof environment, energy, and finance; the power utility; the private sector; civil society; and \nconsumers. \n \n17.  The  RETA  will  require  a  team  of  international  (30  person-months)  and  national \nconsultants (52 person-months), recruited through a consulting firm. The consultants will include \n(i) an international technical expert (team leader) with expertise in energy efficiency economics \nand energy policy and institutional development in small island countries; (ii) an international \ntechnical expert specializing in private and public sector capacity building; (iii) international \nspecialist consultants as required (up to 6 person-months); and (iv) five national technical \nexperts (8 person-months per PIC, for a total of 40 person-months) with experience in energy \nefficiency policy and related projects. Staff from the national implementing agencies will also \nsupport RETA implementation.  \n \n18.  In addition, an assistant project manager (12 person-months) with expertise in energy, \nthe environment, and the management and coordination of ADB TA projects will be recruited in \nthe Philippines by ADB. All consultants will be hired in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) and other arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB for the hiring of national consultants. Outline terms of reference for the consultants as \nwell as reporting requirements are presented in Appendix 3. Given the innovative approach, \nmethodology, and terms of reference required for effective RETA implementation, the consulting \nfirm will be chosen through quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) based on a full technical \nproposal. The quality-cost weighting ratio will be 80:20. \n \n19.  The RETA will be implemented over 14 months, from November 2008 to December \n2009, with services to be rendered intermittently. Within the first 6 weeks, the consultants will \nsubmit an inception report summarizing their findings; identifying specific issues as well as the \nseminars, workshops, and public awareness and education programs to be undertaken; and \nsuggesting any needed changes in the methodology and program. Within the first 7 months, the \nconsultants will submit their midterm report. A draft final report will be submitted within the first \n12 months and discussed at a tripartite meeting among the IAs, ADB, and the consultants, and \nthe final version, incorporating the recommended changes, will be submitted by the 14th and \nfinal month of the RETA. The consultants will submit three hard copies as well as computer files \nof all reports to ADB, the governments, and the IAs. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n20.

Scope of Work \n1.  The regional technical assistance (RETA) will be implemented by eight consultants: two \ninternational  consultants  (a  team  leader  and  an  institutional/human  resource  specialist);  a \nnational consultant locally recruited in the Philippines (assistant project manager); and five \nnational  consultants  (a  national  technical  expert  [NTE]  in  each  participating  Pacific  island \ncountry [PIC]). Allowance has also been made for the recruitment of short-term international \nspecialists (up to 6 person-months) as needed to support project preparation.  \n \n2.  The international consultants will be responsible for all the outputs specified in the terms \nof reference. They will coordinate preparation and finalize (i) the inception report (including the \ndetailed terms of reference, activities, revised technical assistance (TA) framework, TA report \noutlines, and work plan) by the end of week 6; (ii) the midterm report (including the stocktaking \nreport) by the end of month 7; and (iii) the final report by the end of month 14. Report outlines \nwill be discussed and agreed on with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) TA project specialist \nat TA implementation start-up. Outlines of the midterm reports and the final report will be agreed \non during inception. \n \n3.  The RETA will primarily focus on five activities: (i) stocktaking of prior and ongoing \ninitiatives  related  to  energy  efficiency  in  the  region  (those  of  the  European  Union,  the \nInternational  Union  for  Conservation  of  Nature  [IUCN],  and  the  Pacific  Islands  Applied \nGeoscience Commission [SOPAC]); (ii) recommendation of revisions or enhancements in the \nenergy efficiency-related policy and regulatory framework; (iii) in close coordination with formal \nand ad hoc regional bodies and country-level energy project teams (e.g., IUCN energy country \nteams),  establishment  of  an  effective  project  implementation  structure  within  the  national \nimplementing agency in each Pacific developing member country (PDMC) and development of \ndetailed  project  implementation  plans  and  arrangements  in  coordination  with  other  regional \nenergy projects; (iv) recruitment of the five NTEs (i.e., one each in the five participating PICs); and \n(v) identification and preparation of an initial pipeline of appropriate energy efficiency projects for \nfunding by ADB, the Global Environmental Facility (GEF), the Clean Development Mechanism \n(CDM), or other funding sources.  \n \n4.  In  relation  to  project  options,  to  avoid  duplication  and  maximize  opportunities  for \nsynergism, a holistic approach should be adopted, which at the design level takes into account \nthe  impact  of  potential  or  ongoing  activities  sponsored  by  other  agencies  and  programs \npromoting efficiency on the supply side (e.g., distribution system loss reduction programs) and \nthe  demand  side  (e.g.,  relevant  regulatory  reform  or  capacity-building  programs).  In  close \ncoordination with other regional initiatives, the RETA consultants will (i) design sustainable \noperation and maintenance mechanisms and strive to put existing and planned infrastructure to \nbest use; (ii) specify appropriate financing schemes and subsidies; and (iii) maximize positive \neconomic, environmental, and social impact at the local, national, and global levels. \n \n5.  The RETA will include all activities needed to carry out the set of policies and workable \ndelivery mechanisms that will enable the provision of commercially viable energy efficiency \nservices. Further, in preparing the project pipeline for funding by ADB, GEF, CDM, or other \nsources, the RETA will produce concept papers and design and monitoring frameworks for such \nprojects.  The  succeeding  ADB-,  GEF-,  or  CDM-funded  projects  will  tentatively  begin  2\u20133 \nmonths before the end of the RETA, to allow a period of parallel operation, with synchronization \n ", "Appendix 3  11 \nand handover of lessons learned.
