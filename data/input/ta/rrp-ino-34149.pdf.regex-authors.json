Focusing on the needs of the poor, the \nDHS2 will increase the quality and effectiveness of health and family \nplanning  services  in  the  project  area  by  improving  clinical  and \nmanagerial skills of health personnel, upgrading health facilities and \nequipment, and involving civil society in planning and monitoring of \nservice provision. \n   \nRationale  Decentralization  offers  new  opportunities  to  strengthen  health  and \nfamily planning services in the regions through locally adapted reforms \ngiving  health  services  providers  more  appropriate  incentives,  skills, \nsupervision,  material  support,  and  discretionary  authority  needed  to \noffer  high  quality  services,  and  providing  clients  with  information, \nfinancial means, and bargaining power required to elicit appropriate \nresponses.  A  mix  of  human,  physical,  and  financial  resources  are \nneeded  to  help  the  regions  and  the  central  Government  plan, \nimplement, manage, monitor, and evaluate a range of programs and \nactivities.  Low  quality  of  public  health  services  in  Indonesia  affects \nmainly the poor and vulnerable groups and is linked to a range of \nshortcomings in the health sector, which indicate chronic underfunding. \nThe  DHS2  will  address  these  deficits  while  focusing  on  the  health \nneeds of the poor. A better health status will give the poor and the \ncommunity  at  large  greater  opportunity  to  fully  participate  in  the \neconomic development of their specific region and the country.  \n   \nObjectives  The DHS2 will help improve the health status of people in 8 provinces \nof Indonesia, particularly concentrating on improving health services \ngeared to women, children, and infants.  The DHS2 will increase the \nclinical and managerial capacity of health personnel at all levels of \ngovernment, strengthen regulatory and quality assurance functions, and \nresult in improved local health and family planning services. \n   \nCost Estimates  The total project cost is $143.0 million equivalent, of which $73.2 million \n(51%) is the foreign exchange cost and $69.8 million equivalent (49%) \nrepresents the local currency costs. \n   ", "  iii\nFinancing Plan   \n  ($ million equivalent)\nForeign  Local  Total \nSource  % \nExchange  Currency  Cost \nAsian Development Bank  73.2  26.8  100.0  70 \nGovernment    0.0  43.0  43.0  30 \n  Total  73.2  69.8  143.0  100\n   \nLoan Amount and  The DHS2 will be financed by two loans from the Asian Development \nTerms  Bank  (ADB).  A  loan  of  $64.8  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources will be provided under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility. \nThe loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, \nan interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end \nfee of 0.5%, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nLoan Agreement. \nAnother loan of $35.2 million from ADB's Special Funds resources will \nbe provided, and will have a maturity of 32 years, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years. Interest will be charged at 1% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% thereafter. The Borrower is the Government of \nIndonesia. \n   \nAllocation and  The total amount of $100.0 million provided by ADB will cover 100% of \nRelending Terms  the foreign exchange costs (51% of the total project cost), and 38% of \nthe local currency cost. The Government will provide the remaining \n$43.0 million equivalent (30% of total project cost). \n \nThe  Government  will  forward  loan  proceeds  as  grants  to  regional \ngovernments participating in the DHS2, taking into account that the \nDHS2 will directly benefit the poor and will focus on essential health \nservices  that  do  not  generate  revenues.  Participating  regional \ngovernments will contribute to the project costs in accordance with their \nfiscal capacity. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2010 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2010 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  MOH will be the Executing Agency for the Project; BKKBN will be the \nImplementing Agency for family planning activities. \n   \nImplementation  The secretary general of MOH will be the project director who will be \nArrangements  advised  by  a  national  steering  committee  on  policy  matters  and \nintersectoral  coordination.  The  senior  advisor  to  MOH  dealing  with \ndecentralization will be the deputy project director in MOH and will also \nact as project manager MOH. The BKKBN principal secretary will be \ndeputy project director for BKKBN. Both deputy project directors will \nprovide policy guidance and will ensure coordination with other projects \nsupporting  decentralization.  The  director  of  program  and  policy  of \nBKKBN  will  be  the  deputy  project  manager  of  BKKBN.  A  national ", "iv   \ntechnical  team  of  ministry  experts  will  advise  the  deputy  project \ndirectors. A central project implementation unit in MOH and a subunit in \nBKKBN will coordinate project implementation at the national level. A \nsimilar management structure will be established at the two regional \nlevels  of  government.  Provincial  project  implementation  units  will \nsupport and coordinate district and city implementation units. Health \ncommittees  with  a  wide  representation  of  government  services, \nprofessional associations, and civil society will be established to advise \nthe regional project directors and ensure participation and transparency \nof decision-making. In the regions, regular government staff will be in \ncharge of project implementation full time. The DHS2 funds will be used \nto contract additional project management staff where needed. As local \ncapacity increases with project support, regional governments will be \nable to progressively replace contracted staff with civil servants. \n   \nProcurement  Procurement of goods and civil works will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement. The award of civil work contracts with an estimated value \nof $2.0 million or more will follow the international competitive bidding \nprocedure, while local competitive bidding will apply to contracts valued \nbelow $2.0 million. Procurement of goods will be consolidated at the \nprovincial or central level while an adequate representation of lower \nlevel governments will be assured in the procurement committees. The \nparticipating  regions  will  sign  separate  contracts  with  the  winning \nbidder,  and  guarantee  payment  of  their  share  of  the  goods. \nInternational  competitive  bidding  will  be  used  to  procure  goods \nestimated to cost more than $500,000 equivalent. If the estimated value \nis less than $500,000, international shopping procedures will apply, \nexcept  for  vehicles,  motorcycles,  and  office  equipment,  where  local \ncompetitive bidding procedures will apply. Items of less than $100,000 \nequivalent can be procured under direct purchase procedures.  \n   \nConsulting Services  The DHS2 will fund a total of 130 person-months of international and \n388  person-months  of  domestic  consultancy  providing  support  in \nproject management, health system development, health planning and \nfinancing,  human  resources  development,  public  health,  health \ninformation and health promotion, civil works, and health technology. \nThe consultants will be engaged by the central project implementation \nunitis of MOH and BKKBN according to needs at national level and on \nrequest of the regions. The consultants will be engaged individually or \nthrough  consulting  firms  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for  the \nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  ADB\u2019s  quality  and  cost-based \nselection method will apply for consulting firms. \n   ", "  v\nProject Benefits and  The DHS2 will help to improve the health of the population at large and \nBeneficiaries  of poor and vulnerable groups in particular through increased spending \nfor health, better prioritization and targeting of health services, improved \nresource mobilization, enhanced service quality, and better access for \nvulnerable  groups.  It  will,  above  all,  benefit  women,  children,  and \ninfants due to its priority support for mother and child health care. An \nestimated 186,000 girl infants (39,400 of them poor), and 1.51 million \nunder-five girls (315,000 of them  poor) will benefit from  the DHS2. \nAltogether about 4 million poor will benefit from the DHS2.  Given the \nemphasis  on  capacity  building,  health  professionals  and  other  staff \ndelivering health services at all levels will be direct beneficiaries. At \nleast 50% of participants in managerial and clinical training activities will \nbe female health staff. \n   \nRisks and  As  the  DHS2  covers  98  regional  governments,  new  decentralized \nAssumptions  planning and management mechanisms set up at subnational levels \nmay not function as anticipated and national leadership may not be \nstrong enough to provide necessary regulatory guidance and technical \nsupport.  DHS2 funds will be used to contract qualified management \nstaff, to be progressively replaced over the project life by civil servants. \nDirect  project  support  will  be  provided  to  MOH  and  BKKBN  to \nstrengthen  their  management  and  supervisory  functions,  including \nfiduciary controls. The DHS2 will also introduce the use of information \nand  communication  technology  for  supervision,  monitoring,  and \nsupport. \n  \nLocal autonomy over resource allocation and lack of experience may \nlead to short-term politically motivated activities, for example support for \nhigh  profile  hospital  services.  Project  activities  will  facilitate  policy \ndialogue  with  regional  governments  to  advocate  investment  in  the \nhealth  sector  aiming  at  an  allocation  of  5%  of  the  regional  annual \nbudget for the health sector by the end of the DHS2.  All capacity-\nbuilding and advocacy activities of the DHS2 emphasize cost-efficient \nallocation of resources needed. \n   \nIssues of good governance will be addressed by (i) close supervision by \nthe  central  project  coordination  unit,  (ii)  mandatory  community \nparticipation  in  district  health  committees,  and  (iii)  increased \ntransparency based on the dissemination of project-related information \nto nongovernment organizations and the display of project information \non a project web site.

I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the Republic of Indonesia for the Second Decentralized Health Services Project (DHS2).1 \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  From 1970 to 2001, life expectancy at birth increased from 46 to 64 years of age for \nmales and to 68 years of age for females, reflecting the decline in the infant and under-5 \nmortality rates. Infant mortality declined from 145 to 33 infant deaths and under-5 mortality \ndeclined from 172 to 45 per thousand live births. Easier access to health services combined \nwith economic growth and better education contributed to improving the health status. However, \nIndonesia\u2019s health status indicators remain low2 and achievements have been uneven across \nprovinces,  between  urban  and  rural  areas,  and  between  rich  and  poor  segments  of  the \npopulation. With 25% of all under-5-year-old children underweight and 50% of pregnant women \nsuffering from iron deficiency anemia, malnutrition remains a public health issue. Maternal \nmortality, estimated at 380 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, is unacceptably high. While \ncardiovascular and chronic diseases have become the main causes of mortality, infectious and \nparasitic diseases, which particularly affect the poor, dominate morbidity. Tuberculosis, malaria, \nrespiratory infections, and diarrhea remain major public health issues. This combination of \nchronic, life-style, and infectious diseases creates a double burden of diseases for the health \nsystem of the country. A detailed description of the health sector and its performance in the \nproject area is in Appendix 2. \n \n3.  Over the last 3 decades, Indonesia has given priority to improving physical access to \nprimary health care (PHC) services. The average distance to a health facility in 2002 was 5 \nkilometers in rural areas and 1.5 kilometers in urban areas, but chronic underfunding and \ninefficient targeting has prevented better results. Total national expenditures for health have \nbeen low by international standards. In 1995, only 1.6% of gross domestic product was spent on \nhealth.  The  proportion  increased  to  2.7%  in  2000,  but  the  Government\u2019s  share  of  health \nexpenditure, excluding external aid, fell from 46.0% in 1995 to 23.7%. The percentage of central \nGovernment expenditure allocated to the health sector is only 2%, compared with 5% in the \nPhilippines and 8% in Thailand. Health expenditure per capita ($19) is below the average of \nlow-income countries ($21), the Philippines ($33), and Thailand ($71). Chronic underfunding \nhas affected maintenance of facilities; procurement of medical equipment, drugs, and other \nsupplies; and the quality of training for health workers, before and after graduation. A low 30% \nutilization rate of public health services suggests low client satisfaction.  \n \n4.  Consultations in the villages during project preparation confirmed that low quality and \ninadequate services that do not respond to needs felt by the local population were important \nreasons for low utilization of public health services. For the poor, even minimal user fees can be \nan obstacle to the use of health services. The World Bank found that the richest 20% of the \n                                                 \n1  The Project framework is in Appendix 1. Project preparatory technical assistance was provided for the Project   \n(Asian Development Bank [ADB]. 2001. Technical Assistance to Indonesia for the Preparation of the Second \nDecentralized Health Services Project [JSF]. Manila). \n2  For example, in Thailand infant mortality was 25 and in the Philippines 30 and maternal mortality was 44 and 170, \nrespectively. ", "2  \npopulation were 3 and 1.5 times more likely to use inpatient and outpatient public health \nservices, respectively, than the poorest 20% of the population.3 \n \n5.  The Government has developed a successful family planning program advocating birth \nspacing, small families, and family welfare.4 Spearheaded by the National Family Planning \nCoordinating  Board  (BKKBN),  the  success  of  the  program  with  its  different  targets  and \nstrategies for each province can be attributed to its flexibility, adaptability, and results-oriented \napproach.  Modern  methods  of  contraception  have  been  available  throughout  the  country, \nresulting in a contraceptive prevalence rate of 56.7% in 2002. The total fertility rate reflecting the \naverage number of births per woman declined from 4.1 in 1985 to 2.6 in 2002\u20132003, and the \nannual population growth rate steadily decreased from 2.2% in 1985 to 1.47% in 2000.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n6.  Since January 2001, regional governments are responsible for financing and delivery of \nhealth  services  in  the  context  of  regional  autonomy  and  decentralization.  With  second-tier \nregional governments now being the deciding authority regarding health policies and budget \nallocations for their regions, the national and provincial authorities cannot determine the health \nagenda of districts and cities anymore. This raises issues of coordination and regulation as well \nas  of  quality  assurance.  The  announcement  of  obligatory  functions  and  minimum  service \nstandards has given the national Government an important tool to ensure quality and regulation \nin the sector. This will allow the Ministry of Health (MOH) to specifically address shortcomings of \nregional health services in relation to defined service standards. Project-related annual health \nsector  plans  of  regional  governments  as  practiced  by  the  ongoing  Decentralized  Health \nServices (DHS1) Project provide another opportunity to enforce quality and compliance with \ndefined standards because plans have to be consistent with the central Government's norms \nand quality requirements. \n \n7.  Decentralization can increase accountability of health service providers and regional \nauthorities and offer greater opportunity for the community to influence resource allocation and \nservice quality. Since the allocation of resources is now decided by elected regional authorities \nand no longer by technocrats in the central Government, allocation criteria and priorities have \nbecome  part  of  the  political  debate.  Without  appropriate  capacity  building  and  advocacy, \nregional governments may not become aware of the benefits of investing in health and family \nplanning, and health needs of poor and vulnerable groups may not become a political priority. \nAlthough quality PHC services, maternal and child health, and nutrition programs are universally \nrecognized to be highly cost-effective programs that benefit the poor, regional governments may \nprefer  to  invest  in  high  profile  hospitals  that  would  undermine  sector  cost-effectiveness. \nDecentralization requires a new approach and a new role from MOH different from the previous \nfocus on top-down planning and budgeting.  \n \n8.  Equally, new skills and knowledge are required at the regional levels. In a decentralized \nenvironment, regional health staff are in charge of needs identification, planning, budgeting, \nmonitoring,  and  evaluation.  Essential  drugs  must  be  purchased  and  health  staff  must  be \nproperly  qualified  to  prescribe  them  in  an  appropriate  manner.  Even  with  qualified  health \npersonnel, poor health facilities and insufficient medical equipment prevent the provision of \nquality services. Also, financing of the health services in terms of cost sharing between different \n                                                 \n3  World Bank. 2003.

(preliminary report). \nJakarta. ", "  3\nlayers of government and the mobilization of additional resources remains a problem. In most \ndistricts, cities, and provinces, the managerial capacity to address these issues is weak or does \nnot exist.  \n \n9.  The quantity and qualification of primary health workers is a major issue. Indonesia has \non average one doctor per 6,000\u20137,000 people, but the situation is worse in rural areas where \nremote localities remain underserved with less than one doctor per health center. Young doctors \nand midwives are required to provide PHC services under a 3-year compulsory contract. The \ndoctors work in district hospitals and health centers and midwives are posted in health centers \nand in small village-based health facilities. Incentives, benefits, and opportunities vary and \ndepend largely on the individual regional government. Specialized doctors tend to move toward \nbigger urban centers, which offer better professional opportunities and monetary incentives. \nThis creates a major problem for the recruitment and retention of qualified health personnel in \ndistricts, cities, and provinces that cannot provide such incentives.  \n \n10.  Village midwives are most often the first contact of the rural population when it comes to \nhealth services and provide services that are much appreciated by the poor. Their training, \nhowever, does not equip them to deliver quality PHC services. There is a need to offer regular \ntraining, supervision, and necessary equipment and essential drugs.5 MOH is implementing a \nnew training policy to address this issue, developing hospital-based training in provinces and in \nselected districts, expecting to attract local professionals that will stay in the region.  \n \n11.  Starting  on  1  January  2004,  BKKBN  will  have  to  decentralize  its  successful  family \nplanning services, and regional governments will become responsible for ensuring access to the \nfamily planning and reproductive health programs. BKKBN\u2019s vision is to help Indonesian families \nbecome prosperous, healthy, and independent, with two children only, and to provide access to \nfamily planning services for the poor. A particular policy of BKKBN is to ensure continuous \navailability of free or subsidized contraceptives for the poor. However, this policy may be difficult \nto maintain because major donors\u2014in particular the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment\u2014have announced their withdrawal from the population and family planning sector.  \n \n12.  MOH and BKKBN are obliged by decentralization laws to adjust to new roles that include \nregulatory and standardization functions; provision of guidance and capacity building; reform of \nthe health sector, including health care financing; mobilization of resources; and monitoring and \nevaluation of service quality. MOH has developed a list of essential health services that must be \nprovided by districts and municipalities.6  The delivery of such services is in the hands of \nregional governments, and MOH's and BKKBN's role is to advocate a comprehensive and \nintegrated approach to health problems instead of implementing activities through line agencies.  \n \n13.  Ensuring universal access to PHC services, better targeting of the poor and vulnerable \ngroups, and mobilization of new resources for health care financing are MOH\u2019s and BKKBN\u2019s \npriority strategies, which have been linked to the achievement of the health-related Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). The Government is committed to achieving the MDGs. But without \naddressing specific health needs of the poor, the MDG targets will be difficult to achieve. MOH \nhas defined four priority strategies in the context of its Healthy Indonesia 2010 Strategy that \ndescribes MOH\u2019s new vision, mission, and direction: health-conscious national development, \n                                                 \n5  A World Bank project supporting decentralization in the health sector, Health Workforce and Services Project, \napproved on 12 June 2003, plans to address health workforce issues systematically. \n6  Decree of Minister of Health of the Republic of Indonesia No. 1457/ Menkes/SK/X/2003, published on 10 October \n2003, on Minimum Service Standards in the Health Sector in Districts and Municipalities. ", "4  \nimproved  professional  qualification,  greater  coverage  with  health  insurance,  and \ndecentralization of authority and public accountability.  \n \n14.  Similarly, ADB\u2019s health sector policy7 emphasizes access for all to basic health services \nthat are effective, cost-efficient, and affordable.  The policy highlights (i) health of the poor, \nwomen, and indigenous people; (ii) setting of clear priorities to ensure the most efficient use of \nresources; (iii) mobilization of resources for the public health sector; (iv) building of managerial \ncapacity; (v) testing of innovative approaches; (vi) introduction of effective new technologies; \n(vii) focus on functions that constitute public goods; and (viii) encouragement of collaboration \nbetween  public  and  private  health  service  providers.  The  country  strategy  and  program8 \nemphasizes  reducing  poverty  and  regional  inequalities,  focusing  on  good  governance  and \ncapacity  for  long-term  sustainable  development;  meeting  local  development  needs  through \ndecentralization, promoting human development; mainstreaming environmental management; \nand reducing poverty by promoting long-term growth. \n \n15.  External  assistance  to  Indonesia\u2019s  health  sector  increased  from  about  $573  million \nbetween 1994 and 1997 to approximately $2.24 billion from 1998 to 2002. The main sources of \nassistance were ADB, World Bank, Japan Bank for International Cooperation, United States \nAgency for International Development, Australian Agency for International Development, the \nNetherlands, and the specialized United Nations (UN) agencies: UN Development Programme \n(UNDP), UN Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), UN Population Fund (UNFPA), and World Health \nOrganization (WHO). External assistance mainly supported health services quality, nutrition, \ncommunity health, women\u2019s health, and family planning. Details are provided in Appendix 3. \n \nC.

As part of a series of externally-financed projects supporting decentralization of the \nhealth  sector,  the  Project  is  a  geographical  extension  of  ADB\u2019s  DHS1,9  and  incorporates \nlessons learned from the DHS1 and other ongoing projects, in particular the World Bank-\nfinanced provincial health projects I and II and its Health Workforce and Service Project.  The \nlack  of  professional  and  management  skills  at  the  regional  level  emerged  as  the  biggest \nbottleneck in these projects. A technically strong central project implementation unit (PIU) that \nsupports local implementation units proved to be essential for achieving project objectives. In \naddition, implementation arrangements need to clearly define the responsibilities of each level \nof governance, avoiding organizational ambiguities that can undermine system performance. In \nthe Family Health and Nutrition Project,10 a technical adviser attached to the PIU played a \ndecisive  role  ensuring  that  project  activities  remained  aligned  with  project  objectives.  This \ntechnical adviser proved instrumental in coordinating policies and guidelines from various MOH \ndirectorates.   \n \n17.  Detailed  implementation  schedules  for  the  first  year  of  project  implementation  are \nessential  to  avoid  initial  delays  of  activities.  New  communication  technologies  in  terms  of \nelectronic mail and Internet can help to overcome communication problems in a country as vast \nas Indonesia, though the required physical infrastructure may not be sufficiently developed in all \nregions.

In 1998, spurred by the Asian economic crisis, the Government started implementing its \nSocial Safety Net Program to protect access to social services for the poor.11 It was initiated as \nan  externally-supported  emergency  program  and  is  financed  in  the  meantime  by  special \nGovernment subsidies, but still waits to be transformed into a sustainable long-term program. \nMOH focused its efforts on PHC services, including emergency hospitalizations. The program, \nsupported by ADB with two sector development programs, offered free access to essential \nhealth services for the poor at health centers and district hospitals using block grant subsidies to \nthese  facilities;  a  health-center-based  feeding  program  for  infants,  children,  and  pregnant \nwomen; and increased outreach activities of the village midwives. As a result, visits to health \ncenters increased and more deliveries were attended by trained health personnel. The Social \nSafety Net Program brought a significant infusion of cash resources for the health sector. \nFocusing on a limited number of activities that targeted the poor and vulnerable groups, this \nProgram  has  protected  universal  access  to,  and  increased  utilization  of  essential  health \nservices. \n \n19.  Health sector reforms are not always well understood by regional governments and \nrequire  guidance,  advocacy,  and  continued  dialogue  initiated  by  the  national  Government. \nDeveloping better coordination of public and private service provision at the regional level has \nbeen advocated by DHS1.  It took 2 years of persuasion before regional governments were \nwilling to consider developing such partnerships. Still, advocacy is considered to be more \nsuccessful than prescription by project design.  In view of weak capacities, flexibility is needed \nduring project implementation to allow project beneficiaries to modify plans and priorities based \non  their  increasing  knowledge  and  skills.  Thus,  a  mix  of  human,  physical,  and  financial \nresources  is  needed,  including  more  effective  bottom-up  planning  and  implementation \nmechanisms that promote stakeholder participation. Above all, health services must become \nresponsive to the needs of the poor segments of society to have an impact on the health status \nof the population at large. \n  \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objective \n20.  The DHS2 Project will help improve the health of the population in the project area, as \nmeasured by health-related indicators of the MDGs, through better PHC services focusing on \nthe needs of women, infants, children, and the poor. The purpose of the DHS2 is to improve \nhealth services in 8 provinces and 90 districts and cities.  \n \n21.  The DHS2 will cover districts and cities in the following provinces: Bangka Belitung; \nCentral and South Kalimantan; East and West Nusa Tenggara; Gorontalo; South Sulawesi; and \nSouth Sumatra. Bangka Belitung and Gorontalo are two newly created provinces that need \nspecial support to develop their management capacity. South Sumatra and Central and South \nKalimantan were part of previous ADB-supported health sector projects and their participation in \nthe DHS2 will enable them to consolidate previous achievements. In East and West Nusa \nTenggara, the DHS2 will help integrate inputs of various externally-financed interventions to \ndevelop a more comprehensive and efficient local health system.  \n                                                 \n11  The program started with establishing criteria to define the poor. These criteria will be used for the Project. ", "6  \n22.  The DHS2 aims at achieving (i) improved capacity at the regional level to ensure the \nprovision of quality health and family planning services; (ii) local health services with improved \nequitability,  quality,  and  financially  sustainability;  and  (iii)  improved  capacity  of  MOH  and \nBKKBN to support regional governments to deliver such services. Capacity-building activities at \nall levels of government will provide much needed managerial and clinical skills to deliver quality \nPHC services and address the needs of the poor.  At least 50% of the participants in DHS2-\nfunded training programs will be women.  Investments in PHC facilities, vehicles and equipment, \nand the provision of essential drugs will complement capacity-building inputs of the DHS2.  \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n23.  The  DHS2  consists  of  three  components.  The  first  component  will  strengthen  the \nhuman, physical, and organizational capacity of districts and cities through (i) managerial and \nclinical  training;  (ii)  upgrading  of  health  facilities  and  purchase  of  equipment,  vehicles  for \noutreach activities, and essential medical supplies; (iii) development of institutional mechanisms \nthat facilitate community participation and promote accountability and transparency of service \nproviders through regional health committees; and (iv) strengthening of regulatory and licensing \nfunctions that protect the poor. The managerial training will cover health service planning and \nbudgeting, health care financing, and monitoring and evaluation, and will promote participatory \napproaches to identify local health and family planning needs and to identify and implement \ntechnically appropriate and locally acceptable health programs. Clinical training for doctors, \nnurses,  and  midwives  will  be  evidence-based  and  on-site  at  health  centers  and  referral \nhospitals, focusing on PHC, maternal and child health, and communicable disease control. \nUpgrading of facilities concentrates mainly on the rehabilitation of health posts for midwives, \nhealth centers, subhealth centers, and selected district hospitals, with a limited scope for the \nconstruction of new facilities. Technical assistance will support advocacy workshops and public \nprivate  partnership  meetings  to  empower  district  health  committees  that  will  become \ninstrumental  in  exploiting  the  opportunities  of  decentralization  in  terms  of  increased \ntransparency, focus on local needs and conditions, and inclusion of civil society in the planning \nand delivery of health services. The DHS2 will provide guidelines that refocus the licensing and \naccreditation of personnel and health facilities on better quality and access to health services for \nwomen, vulnerable groups, and the poor. \n \n24.  The second component will develop professional capacity, improve referral regional \nhospitals and training facilities, and advocate health sector reforms at provincial level through (i) \nclinical training for specialists, health care managers, and trainers; (ii) upgrading or purchasing \nof new equipment; (iii) transforming provincial hospitals into local teaching institutions; (iv) \nsupporting information and advocacy campaigns for health and family planning; and (v) support \nfor regulatory functions and quality assurance by provincial governments. Under the guidance \nand with technical support of MOH and BKKBN, managerial training will be provided covering \nquality  assurance  and  the  design  of  specific  health  care  reforms  such  as  social  health \ninsurance, public-private partnerships, referral systems, and coordination of drug procurement \namong districts and provinces. They will disseminate policies and guidelines from the national \nGovernment and information about successful practices. In-country fellowships and comparative \nstudies will be offered to selected candidates. DHS2 funds will also be used to rehabilitate and \nprovide  equipment  and  vehicles.  Women  will  be  given  priority  to  participate  in  all  training \nactivities. Activities of this component will support MOH's policy to develop a local pool of \nqualified health professionals by using provincial hospitals as teaching hospitals. Capacity of \nprovinces to regulate the health sector, oversee performance of district services, and ensure the \nimplementation  of  minimum  service  standards  and  the  reform  of  health  centers  will  be ", "  7\nstrengthened. The DHS2 funds will also be used to rehabilitate and provide equipment and \nvehicles for outreach activities. \n \n25.  The third component will support MOH and BKKBN to change from a command and \ncontrol  leadership  role  to  new  functions  and  responsibilities  that  consist  of  consultation, \ncoordination, provision of technical assistance to regional governments, provision of essential \ndrugs for the poor, quality assurance, regulation and standardization, policy development and \nreform, and resource mobilization. Activities of this component will include a review of major \ntechnical curative and preventive approaches based on studies, action research and pilot tests   \naiming at health sector reforms that focus on maternal and child health, health services for the \npoor, and sustainable delivery of PHC services in a decentralized setting. A focal point of \nsupport will be the promotion of public private partnership approaches related to community-\nbased health services planning and delivery, health financing and insurance, and health sector \ninfrastructure12. The creation of a national partnership forum will facilitate the empowerment of \nprofessional associations, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and private service providers \nthrough selected human resource development activities. The DHS2 resources will also be used \nto finance the development of generic information, education, and training materials, and the \ndevelopment  of  a  competency-based  clinical  training  in  newly  created  provincial  teaching \nhospitals. In-country and overseas fellowships and comparative studies based on training needs \nassessments will help strengthen the capacity to analyze and respond to decentralization needs \nof the sector and to design and implement health sector reforms that will give priority to the \nreform  of  existing  health  centers,  which  particularly  cater  to  the  poor  segments  of  the \npopulation. Activities will include the development of a physical infrastructure for knowledge-\nbased and user-friendly management information systems. Under this component, the DHS2 \nwill help BKKBN cover the contraceptive needs of the poor during the transition period of \ndecentralizing its services and until a sustainable financing mechanism has been developed for \nthe procurement of contraceptives. \n \nC.  Special Features \n26.  The  DHS2  has  been  designed  to  support  decentralized  service  delivery,  like  its \npredecessor, DHS1. DHS2 has established full ownership by regional governments, through \ntheir detailed subproject proposals and their substantial budget contributions. The DHS2 will \nallow the national Government to specifically address shortcomings of service provision in \nindividual regions by demanding compliance with obligatory functions and minimum service \nstandards when approving annual plans of district/cities for funding by the DHS2. Due to the \nnumber  of  second-tier  governments  involved,  provincial  project  managers  will  consolidate \nannual plans before submission for approval by the Government and ADB. Individual district \nand city plans, including related comments from district and city health committees, will be \nsubmitted for information to the Government and to ADB. \n \n27.  Local leaders and health professionals will be supported to develop the capability to \nadequately  identify  specific  health  needs  of  poor  and  vulnerable  groups  and  implement \nappropriate programs by applying a participatory approach that involves the beneficiaries. This \nimplies  a  priority  for  PHC  services  and  diseases  particularly  affecting  the  poor\u2014such  as \nmalaria, tuberculosis, acute respiratory infection, diarrhea, and malnutrition. PHC facilities most \nused by the poor will be strengthened, in particular health posts for village midwives, subhealth \ncenters, and health centers. Reform of health centers has been identified as a priority activity of \n                                                 \n12 ADB\u2019s ongoing advisory technical assistance 4094-INO: Public Health and Nutrition is expected to provide a tested \nmodel of public-private partnership for the health sector before loan effectiveness of DHS2. ", "8  \nMOH under the DHS2. The DHS2 will help develop appropriate mechanisms to sustain pro-poor \nactivities  of  the  Social  Safety  Net  Program  under  the  authority  of  regional  governments, \nfollowing  the  priority  of  the  DHS2  to  support  maternal  and  child  health  of  the  poor  and \nvulnerable groups. \n \n28.  As most of the districts in the selected provinces will participate, the DHS2 will help \nstrengthen  coordination  and  cooperation  among  districts  and  provinces,  in  particular  for \nepidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases, for developing an effective \nreferral  system,  and  for  developing  capacity  in  the  provincial  hospitals  to  train  qualified \nprofessionals that will work in the region. Dialogue with regional governments will emphasize \nthe benefits of involving professional associations, local universities, the private sector, and \nlocal NGOs in managing local health services. \n \n29.  The DHS2 advocates spending of 5% of the regional annual budget for the health sector \nby the end of the DHS2 and will promote an integrated approach to health financing, cross-\nsectoral coordination, public-private partnerships, monitoring of health service performance and \nof  health  status  indicators,  dissemination  of  information,  and  increased  transparency  and \naccountability. The DHS2 is funding the implementation and dissemination of successful pilot \nexperiments related to health sector reforms and the local adaptation of national guidelines. For \nexample, the DHS2 will support Bangka Belitung and Gorontalo provinces to develop and \nimplement a social health insurance system.  \n \n30.  Particularly in urban areas, individuals, companies, or NGOs provide private health \nservices  that  try  to  directly  respond  to  demand.  Partnerships  between  public  and  private \nproviders can improve the availability of health services for all, the quality of health services, \nand the increased efficiency in the allocation of resources. Such partnerships can improve the \neffectiveness of service delivery while mobilizing additional resources from those who can afford \nto pay, thus allowing an increase of public subsidies for the poor. The DHS2 will support the \ndevelopment of public-private partnerships in health care delivery and financing, which will need \nto materialize in annual health plans of regional governments. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n31.  The total cost of the DHS2 is estimated at $143.0 million equivalent, including duties and \ntaxes. Of the total, $73.2 million (51%) is the foreign exchange cost and $69.8 million equivalent \n(49%) represents the local currency costs.

The Government has requested a loan of $64.8 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources and $35.2 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds to help finance the DHS2. The ordinary \ncapital resources loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility,13 a commitment charge \nof 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee of 0.5% (to be capitalized in the loan), and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreements. The Government has provided ADB with \n(i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis \nof  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \nADB's Special Funds loan will have a 32-year term including a grace period of 8 years with an \ninterest charge of 1% per year during the grace period, and 1.5% per year during the remaining \nterm. ADB will fund 100% of the foreign exchange cost, totaling 49% of the estimated project \ncost, and 38% of the local currency cost. The Government will provide the remaining $43.0 \nmillion equivalent as counterpart financing, which accounts for 30% of total costs. This includes \nfinancing  civil  works,  in-country  training,  systems  development,  workshops,  materials  and \nconsumables, project managements, and taxes and duties.

BKKBN will be the Implementing \nAgency for family planning and family welfare activities. The MOH secretary general will be the \nDHS2's director. The senior advisor to MOH dealing with decentralization will be the deputy \ndirector of MOH and will also act as the project manager of MOH. The principal secretary of \nBKKBN will be deputy director of BKKBN. Both deputy directors will provide policy guidance and \nensure coordination with other projects supporting decentralization in each of their respective \nareas. The director of program and policy at BKKBN will be the deputy project manager of \nBKKBN. A national steering committee consisting, among others, of senior representatives from \nMOH, BKKBN, Ministry of Finance, National Development Planning Agency, Ministry of Home \nAffairs, and State Ministry of Empowerment of Women will provide advice to the DHS2's director \non general policy and intersectoral coordination. A national technical team of ministry experts \nwill advise the deputy directors. A diagram of the project organization is in Appendix 5. \n \n34.  The head of the provincial health services will be the provincial project manager (PPM).  \nThe PPM will be assisted by the provincial PIU, composed of a full-time executive secretary, \nfinance officer, procurement officer, and monitoring and evaluation officer, who will coordinate \nproject  implementation  in  the  province  and  provide  technical  support  to  their  participating \ndistricts. The PPM will report to the provincial governor or the head of the provincial BAPPEDA. \nA provincial health council with a wide representation of government services, professional \nassociations, and civil society will be established to advise the regional project directors and \nensure  transparency  of  decision-making.  A  provincial  technical  review  team,  including \nrepresentatives from MOH and BKKBN, the private health sector, academics and professional \norganizations, and technical experts on an individual basis will assist the provincial PIU.  The \nprovincial  PIU  will  support  and  coordinate  district  and  city  implementation  units  (DIU).  A \nprovincial sub-PIU for BKKBN activities may be established as needed. \n \n35.  At the district and city level, a full-time district executive secretary will be responsible for \nimplementing the project activities, under the guidance of the chief of the district and city health \nservices who will be the district and city project manager (DPM). The DPM will report to the \nchief executive of the district and city. In each district and city, the chief executive of the district \nor city will establish a district health committee (DHC) to advise the DPM and monitor the \nimplementation of DHS2 activities in accordance with the district\u2019s annual plan of action. The \nDHC  will  include  representatives  of  the  district  health  and  family  planning  services,  local \nparliament, private health sector, community leaders, women\u2019s organizations, NGOs, and other \nrepresentatives of civil society. \n \n36.  By 1 June of each year, beginning June 2004, the DHC, DPM and DIU will review and \nupdate the district and city proposal for assistance under DHS2 and transmit the district and city \nannual plan for the following year to the PPM, including the minutes of the DHC and the DPM's \nresponse to the recommendations of DHS. At the provincial level, the district proposals will be \nreviewed  by  the  provincial  health  council  and  the  provincial  technical  review  team  and \nconsolidated on a province-wide basis.  By July 1 of each year, the PPM will transmit the \nconsolidated provincial proposal to the national project manager and deputy project directors, \nincluding a summary of the issues discussed by the provincial technical review team and the \nsolutions  proposed.    After  review  of  the  consolidated  provincial  proposals  by  the  national \ntechnical team, the national project manager and deputy project directors will endorse the \nprovincial proposals (as they may be amended) and submit them to ADB by 1 August of each ", " 11\nyear for approval. Flexibility will be provided to adapt project activities to newly identified needs \nthat are in accordance with project objectives and comply with the Loan Agreements. \n \n37.  The DHS2 will provide strong support for project management. At the national level, a \ncentral PIU in MOH with a sub-unit in BKKBN will coordinate project implementation and provide \ntechnical support to lower level implementation units. The central PIU will have two full-time \nexecutive  secretaries,  each  executive  secretary  being  responsible  for  four  participating \nprovinces with their associated participating districts, and each executive secretary  will be \nsupported by a finance officer, procurement officer, monitoring and evaluation officer, planning \nofficer and other staff as needed. The central PIU will have regular meetings with DHS1 and the \nWorld Bank-supported provincial health projects to ensure coordination. BKKBN will have a \ncentral PIU sub-unit with a full-time executive secretary and support staff. A national technical \nadvisor reporting to the project manager of MOH and the deputy project director of BKKBN will \nbe responsible for the technical quality of the DHS2. The technical advisor will ensure that \nDHS2 objectives are being met and that the Government\u2019s policies are reflected in DHS2 \nactivities. Where possible, districts and provinces will be encouraged to use existing offices and \nstaff for implementation. Where capacity does not exist or requires strengthening, DHS2 funds \nwill be used to finance the services of contracted project management staff at district, province, \nand central levels for a limited period of time. As regional capacity increases over time due to \nproject support, regional governments will progressively replace contracted staff with regular \ncivil servants. The project administration costs are estimated at about 8% of the total base cost \nof the DHS2. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n38.  Project implementation will start in 2004 and is expected to be completed by 30 June \n2010, with a loan utilization period closing on 31 December 2010. Initial project implementation \nactivities will emphasize information, advocacy, and local capacity building in health and family \nplanning. Subsequently, project activities will focus on a reorientation of technical approaches of \nthe  health  system;  physical  investments  identified  in  annual  subproject  proposals;  and \nimplementation  of  appropriate  health  sector  reforms  to  enhance  quality,  sustainability, \neffectiveness and cost-efficiency. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 6. \n \n3.  Procurement \n39.  ADB-financed  goods,  services,  and  civil  works  will  be  procured  following  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. The executing and implementing agencies have been advised of \nthe need for maintaining transparency and accountability in all project activities, as required \nunder ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy. \n \n40.  Procurement packages have been grouped into three categories: civil works, equipment \nand  vehicles,  and  material  and  consumables.  Civil  works  will  involve  construction  and \nrehabilitation work. For civil works, international competitive bidding will apply for contracts \nestimated above the equivalent of $2.0 million. If the estimated contract value is less, local \ncompetitive bidding will apply. When civil works for rehabilitating village health facilities or \nactivities aimed at creating a healthy environment and preventing diseases are estimated to \ncost $10,000 equivalent or less and may involve the participation of the communities, contracts \nmay be awarded in accordance with procedures to be agreed upon between the DIU and the \ncommunity concerned, and acceptable to ADB. Goods estimated to cost more than $500,000 \nequivalent will be procured through international competitive bidding. If the estimated value is \nless, international shopping procedures will apply. ", "12  \n41.  The bidding documents for the procurement of medical equipment, motorcycles, and \nfour-wheel  drive  vehicles  will  be  consolidated  on  a  province-wide  basis.  Contracts  and \npayments for the consolidated procurements will remain the responsibility of each district, city, \nand province that is involved in a specific procurement.  Items of less than $100,000 equivalent \ncan be procured under direct purchase procedures. The proposed procurement procedures and \nindicative procurement packages are summarized in Appendix 7. \n \n42.  Advance action started in November 2003 using Government resources. Advance action \nincludes  recruitment  of  consultants  and  procurement  of  office  equipment  related  to  the \nestablishment of project implementation units at the national and regional levels. Retroactive \nfinancing will apply for eligible activities starting after 21 October 2003.  \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n43.  To facilitate project implementation and management, essential staff for the PIUs will be \nengaged individually, and funded under the DHS2. Consultants will be recruited by the central \nPIUs (MOH and BKKBN) according to the needs of MOH and BKKBN and on request of the \nregions.    Consulting  services  are  grouped  into  the  following  areas  of  expertise:  project \nmanagement  (including  procurement  and  financial  management);  health  system  support \n(including  health  policy,  public-private  partnerships,  and  licensing);  health  planning  and \nfinancing (including health care financing and health insurance); human resources development \n(including needs-based hospital training and nursing); public health (including maternal and \nchild  health,  family  planning  and  reproductive  health,  and  communicable  disease  control); \ninformation, communications and health promotion; civil works and technology including ICT; \nand social and environmental issues including gender strategy and poverty interventions. The \nconsultants will be engaged through one or more firms or individually, in agreement with ADB. \nThe terms of reference of the consultants will be as determined by agreement between ADB \nand MOH or BKKBN. The DHS2 will fund a total of 130 person-months of international and 388 \nperson-months of domestic technical consulting services. Indicative terms of reference are in \nAppendix 8. \n \n44.  All consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants.  Quality  and  cost-based  selection  will  be  applied  for  the  recruitment  of  the \nconsulting firms. The consulting firms will be engaged within 6 months of loan effectiveness. \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n45.  The Government will disburse the proceeds of the loan and the corresponding counterpart \ncontributions necessary for financing project activities by budgetary transfers of funds earmarked \nfor  such  purpose,  in  accordance  with  decentralization  laws  22/1999  and  25/1999  and  the \nprevailing implementing regulations. Except as ADB may otherwise agree, the Government will \nestablish an imprest account at Bank Indonesia to make payments in local currency for project \nimplementation. The imprest account will be established, managed, replenished, and liquidated \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook of January 2001, as amended from \ntime to time, and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the Government and ADB.  The \ninitial  amount  to  be  deposited  into  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  the  equivalent  of \n$2,000,000 for each loan. The statement of expenditures (SOE) procedure may be used for \nreimbursement of eligible expenditures and to liquidate advances provided into the imprest \naccount, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, and detailed arrangements \nagreed upon between the Government and ADB.  Individual payment to be reimbursed or ", " 13\nliquidated under the SOE procedure will not exceed the equivalent of $100,000. Disbursement \nmechanisms and flow of funds, in particular at the regional level, will be further described in the \nproject administration manual, as a condition for loan effectiveness. \n \n46.  All districts and cities in the eight project provinces have been invited to participate in the \nDHS2. Regional governments involved in the DHS2 will contribute to the project costs in their \nregions according to a cost-sharing formula agreed with the national Government. No funds will \nbe disbursed to the regional governments for project activities if the formal commitment required \nby the central Government has not been signed. DHS2 activities, however, can start in regions \nwhose  governments  have  submitted  the  signed  budget  commitment  and  when  the  other \nconditions for loan effectiveness have been fulfilled. \n \n47.  No disbursement of loan proceeds will be made to a participating region (district, city, or \nprovince) (i) if a misprocurement happened or other procurement action in the participating \nregion has been identified as irregular, until the misprocurement or other irregularity has been \ncorrected by the concerned region to the satisfaction of the Government and ADB; (ii) until a \nDIU or provincial PIU, as applicable, has been established; and (iii) until the region\u2019s annual \nplan of activities has been approved by ADB. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n48.  Districts and cities, provinces, MOH, and BKKBN will maintain a separate accounting \nsystem for project expenditures in accordance with sound accounting principles. The project \naccounts, including financial statements, statements of expenditures, and account records will be \naudited annually by auditors acceptable to ADB, as part of the regular audit accounts and financial \nstatements. District accounts will be audited by auditors acceptable to ADB and consolidated at \nthe provincial level.  The consolidated annual audit reports in English\u2014one for each province, one \nfor MOH activities at the central level, and one for BKKBN activities\u2014will be submitted to ADB \nwithin 9 months after the end of the Government's fiscal year. The Government, districts, and \nprovinces have been informed of ADB\u2019s policy on submission of audited financial statements \n(AFS). Funds may be suspended for a district or province that does not submit its AFS within  9 \nmonths after the end of the fiscal year. Reminders will be issued if AFS are overdue, and \ndisbursements of funds will be suspended for districts or provinces where AFS are 9 months \noverdue. \n \n49.  The central PIU in MOH and the subunit in BKKBN will submit to ADB, within 60 days after \nthe end of each calendar quarter, consolidated progress reports on the DHS2 in a form agreed \nupon by the Government and ADB.  \n \n50.  The Government will coordinate and cooperate with ADB in reviewing the DHS2 and, in \nthis connection, will submit to ADB documents and reports that may be required. Within 3 \nmonths after the loan closing date, the provinces and the Government will submit a project \ncompletion report to ADB, in such form and detail as ADB may request.   \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n51.  A list of performance indicators to be achieved by 2010 is in appendixes 1 and 9. Before \nloan  effectiveness,  MOH  and  BKKBN  will  develop  guidelines  for  implementing  a  project \nperformance monitoring system (PPMS), including poverty and gender disaggregated data, for \nuse at the national level in training and capacity-building activities. Each province will develop a \nPPMS for local activities based on the project framework and the national model, and attach it to ", "14  \nits first annual plan of activities. Consultants will provide technical support to strengthen local \nmonitoring capacity and ensure the appropriate use of the baseline data collected during project \npreparation. Indicators, targets, and mechanisms for collecting data will be publicized as soon \nas possible on the Internet. Project-related information, including data on project performance, \navailable via the Internet, will be updated at least every semester. The regional PIUs will ensure \nthat local NGOs are informed about and have access to this information. Benchmark and new \nannual data will be used to support the annual review and update of regional governments\u2019 \nproposals for funding by the DHS2. \n \n52.  The community will actively participate in project monitoring through the DHC. The DHC \nwill meet at least twice a year to review project implementation and the project annual plans. \nThe DHS2 will make appropriate recommendations to the district project manager to modify, if \nnecessary, the plan of action for the following year. The recommendations of the DHC will be \nsent to MOH and BKKBN with appropriate comments of the district project manager, explaining \nhis or her response to the recommendations of the DHC. The DHC's recommendations and the \ncomments of the district project manager will be sent to ADB by MOH's central PIU as an \nattachment to the next consolidated quarterly report. \n \n8.  Project Review \n53.  The Government and ADB will conduct a project review every 6 months after loan \neffectiveness and a midterm review upon completion of the third year of implementation, to \nassess progress and achievements against the objectives, identify any problems encountered, \nand recommend remedial measures or changes, if required. The findings of the midterm review \nwill be discussed at provincial and national workshops to be attended by the health and family \nplanning officers, representatives of the agencies involved in the DHS2, and ADB. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n54.  Project Benefits and Beneficiaries. The DHS2 will improve health services in districts \nand cities in the 8 selected project provinces. The outcome will be a better health status of the \nconcerned population at large and of poor and vulnerable groups in particular. DHS2 activities \ngive  priority  to  common  health  problems  of  poor  and  vulnerable  groups,  such  as  child \nmalnutrition, child and infant mortality, and maternal mortality. About 2 million women and 2 \nmillion men will benefit from the DHS2, with 9%\u201332% of them below the poverty line. Because \nof the priority given to mother and child health care, women will benefit disproportionately from \nthe DHS2. An estimated 180,000 infant girls will benefit from the DHS2 as part of 1.51 million \nunder-five girls (315,000 of them considered to be poor).  \n \n55.  Social and Poverty Analysis. In general, health services and facilities at village health \nposts, mobile health centers, village midwives, health centers cater to the poor. Poor people \nalso use traditional healers and private health services providers because access to quality \nhealth services is often inadequate. In remote rural areas, health service facilities are often \nbeyond the reach of the poor due to transport and high opportunity costs, or health services are \noften of low quality because of the difficulty to retain qualified health personnel in remote areas. \nThe poor often cannot afford private health services except from NGOs, and the relatively low \nquality and ineffectiveness of the public health sector particularly affect their health status. \nSocial and poverty issues are analyzed in detail in appendixes 10 and 11. \n \n56.  Ill health is the single most common trigger for the deterioration of the quality of life of \npoor and vulnerable groups. Illness reduces household savings, lowers learning ability, reduces ", " 15\nproductivity, and leads to a diminished quality of life, thereby creating or perpetuating poverty. \nCompared with the general population, the poor and vulnerable groups are exposed to greater \npersonal and environmental risks, are less well nourished, have less access to information, and \nare less able to access health care.  \n \n57.  Vulnerable  groups  include  indigenous  peoples.  The  executing  and  implementing \nagencies will ensure that project activities have a positive impact on indigenous peoples. To \nensure that indigenous peoples benefit from the DHS2, the following measures have been \ndeveloped: (i) district health plans include an assessment of the needs of indigenous peoples; \n(ii) constraints on indigenous peoples\u2019 participation in and/or benefiting from project activities will \nbe addressed; (iii) community participation in the implementation of project activities will include \nindigenous peoples where relevant; and (iv) monitoring mechanism include the impact of the \nDHS2 on indigenous peoples. If civil works require resettlement, a resettlement plan will be \nprepared, in accordance with the resettlement framework (supplementary appendix B). \n \n58.  Access to health care is a top priority for women and their families, as women tend to be \nresponsible for the care of the young, the sick, and the elderly. Thus, women\u2019s access to health \ncare extends beyond the welfare of the individual to that of the family as a whole. Women in \nrural areas will benefit from several project activities, in particular the upgrading of PHC and \nfamily planning services, strengthening of safe motherhood activities, improvement of training \ninstitutions  for  nurses  and  midwives,  and  development  of  disease  prevention  programs. \nWomen's groups will help women learn about health issues and support each other in case of \ndisease. Gender sensitive planning and budgeting will be promoted at the district level, sex-\ndisaggregated data on the health status of the population will be collected, and participation of \nwomen in managerial training will be supported. The DHS2 will promote increased numbers of \nfemale health staff by encouraging enrollment of women in staff development and training \nactivities sponsored by the DHS2 and setting the target of a 50% participation rate. Other \nspecific measures addressing gender issues are presented in the gender action plan prepared \nfor the DHS2 (supplementary appendix C). \n \n59.  Environment. The DHS2 will rehabilitate and upgrade health facilities in the project \narea, such as hospitals, health centers, subhealth centers, and village health posts. An initial \nenvironmental assessment for project activities has been completed during project preparation. \nThe necessary measures will be taken to minimize environmental impacts. Hospital waste \nmanagement will become part of the capacity-building program. A summary is attached in \nAppendix 12. All civil works will be undertaken considering minimal damage to the environment. \n \n60.  Economic  and  Financial  Analysis.  While  the  DHS2  is  expected  to  yield  several \nbenefits, the economic internal rate of return was calculated using a conservative estimate of \nthe benefits of improved health of the population in the project provinces through improved use \nand  quality  of  health  services  at  the  district  level.    These  conservative  estimates  yield  a \ncomposite economic internal rate of return of 37%, with rates ranging from 21.5% in East Nusa \nTenggara to 50.2% in South Sumatra. A detailed economic and financial analysis is in Appendix \n13. \n \n61.  The DHS2 is primarily expected to reduce the burden of disease, measured by the \nreduction in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost due to death and disability.  Project \nbenefits have been estimated in terms of reduction of the gap in DALY between the project \nprovinces  and  developed  countries,  multiplied  by  the  2002  per  capita  provincial  minimum ", "16  \nwages.  Data derived from the 1993 World Development Report14 indicates that the gap in \nDALY between non-Indian and Chinese Asian countries and established market economies was \nabout 143 per 1000 population.  The gap in DALY is estimated by disaggregating the major \ndisease categories, using relatively recent (1995) burden of disease data on previous health \nprojects. The value of DALY saved in each province is the monetary value of the minimum wage \nlevels in the province.15  For DHS2, the maximum benefit effect assumes a reduction of the gap \nby 7.4 DALYs per 1000 population. \n \n62.  The  total  financial  cost  of  the  DHS2,  inclusive  of  taxes,  duties,  contingencies,  and \ninterest charges, is $143 million for a period of 6 years.  The DHS2 will provide funds to districts \nand  provinces  to  support  development  spending  to  achieve  increased  health  outcomes. \nFinancial rates of return are not calculated since cost recovery is not a factor in the project \ndesign. Hence, fiscal impact analysis was done to evaluate the impact of the Project on the \nGovernment budget.  There is a wide variation both within and across provinces in health \nspending.  In most districts, the levels of health spending are about 1\u20132% of the local district \nbudget expenditures. \n \n63.  Based on project disbursements, projections were made to assess the annual district \nhealth expenditure as a result of the incremental project investment so that the respective \ngovernment is presented with clear funding commitment.  With the DHS2, total district health \nexpenditure will average about 2% of local expenditures during the project period. This is \nconsidered to have minimal impact on local budgetary resources.  To make a substantial impact \non key health indicators, however, a substantial increase in health spending will be required.  To \navoid a sharp drop in spending by 2011, government health spending would have to increase \nduring project implementation in order to sustain and deepen project benefits.  Although the \ncosts of health system reforms are one-time costs, local government commitment will have to \nbe obtained to ensure sustainability of the health reforms and to maintain the improved public \nhealth facilities.  Increased levels of health spending at the district and city level could be \nachieved  through  cross-subsidies  between  better-off  and  poor  areas,  increased  budgetary \ntransfers  from  central  Government,  and  other  resource  mobilization  mechanisms  (e.g., \ncommunity mobilization and public-private-partnerships). \n \n64.  Risks and Assumptions. With the participation of 98 regional governments and new \ndecentralized  planning  and  budgeting  mechanisms  set  up  at  subnational  levels,  project \nadministration will be challenging.  Leadership at the national level may not be strong enough to \nprovide necessary regulatory guidance and technical support. DHS2 funds will therefore be \nused to contract qualified management staff to compensate for shortcomings in the provision of \nqualified staff at all levels of government. The DHS2 will also make the best possible use of \ninformation and communication technology for supervision, monitoring, and distance support. \n  \n65.  Increased  local  autonomy  over  resource  allocation  may  follow  short-term  political \nincentives, for example high profile support for hospital services. Project activities will facilitate \npolicy dialogue with regional governments to advocate investment in the health sector aiming at \nan allocation of least 5% of the regional annual budget for health by the end of the DHS2. Each \nregion will establish a midterm target that will become part of the PPMS. All capacity-building \nand  advocacy  activities  of  the  DHS2  strongly  emphasize  more  cost-efficient  allocations  of \nresources and the needs of the poor. \n                                                 \n14  World Bank. 1993. World Development Report. Washington DC. \n15 Central Bureau of Statistics. 2002. National Socioeconomic Survey. Jakarta. ", " 17\n66.  Issues of good governance will be addressed by (i) improved supervision by the central \nPIU, (ii) mandatory community participation in district health committees, and (iii) increased \ntransparency based on the dissemination of project-related information to NGOs and the display \nof project information on a project web site. Detailed measures preventing fraud and corruption \nwill be integrated in the project administration memorandum. \n \n67.  While DHS2 expenditures are one-off in nature, sustainability of the project will depend \non  increased  levels  of  expenditure  on  health  care  at  the  regional  level.  Any  inability  or \nunwillingness of a regional government to make the requisite investments in OHC is therefore a \nrisk for the DHS2.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n68.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and MOH and BKKBN have \ngiven the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n69.  Annual Plans. By 1 June of each year, beginning June 2004, the DHC, DPM, and DIU \nwill review and update the district proposal for assistance under the DHS2 and transmit the plan \nto the PPM, including the minutes of the DHC and DPM's response to recommendations of the \nDHC. At the provincial level, district proposals will be reviewed by the provincial technical review \nteam and consolidated on a province-wide basis. By 1 July of each year, the provincial technical \nreview team will transmit the consolidated provincial proposal to the national project manager \nincluding a summary of the issues discussed by the provincial technical review team and the \nsolutions  proposed.    After  review  of  the  consolidated  provincial  proposals  by  the  national \ntechnical team, the national project manager will endorse the provincial proposals (as they may \nbe amended) and submit them to ADB by 1 August of each year for approval. \n \n70.  Counterpart Funds. The Borrower will ensure that all necessary counterpart funds for \nproject implementation at the national level are provided in a timely manner and take all other \nmeasures necessary or appropriate for prompt disbursement of national funds to the project \nprovinces and project districts during each year of implementation. The Borrower will ensure \nthat participating districts, cities, and provinces are aware of the need to provide counterpart \nfunding for project activities and that they are informed that a failure to produce the required \ncounterpart funding for more than 1 year will result in that participating province, district or city \nbeing ineligible for further participation in the DHS2, unless otherwise agreed by ADB.  \n \n71.  Except as ADB may otherwise agree, the Borrower will ensure that, throughout the \nperiod of project implementation, the proceeds of the loan, and the corresponding amount of \nnecessary counterpart funds, will be disbursed to project provinces and project districts, by \nbudgetary transfers of funds earmarked for such purpose. \n \n72.  The Government has given the following assurances in relation to the application of the \nMOF  decree  35/2003  on  Planning,  Implementation/Administration,  and  Monitoring  of \nGovernment Subsidiary Offshore Loans to Regions. \n \n(i)  All  funds  distributed  under  the  DHS2  to  the  participating  districts,  cities,  and \nprovinces  will  be  for  noncost  recovery  and  nonrevenue  generating projects,  and \ntherefore, the funds so distributed are grants to the participating regions. \n ", "18  \n(ii)  The total value of each subproject will be calculated as the amount of the grant plus \nand the counterpart contribution. \n  \n(iii)  The signing of the \"ongranting\" agreement, regardless of the actual date of signing, \nwill be construed as occurring on the date of signing the Loan Agreements.  \n \n73.  Auditing.  The  Borrower  will  ensure  that  any  independent  auditors  financed  from \nproceeds of the loan will be selected and engaged in accordance with competitive selection \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. \n \n74.  The Borrower will ensure that all project provinces, and all project districts and cities, \nMOH and BKKBN maintain a separate accounting system for DHS2 expenditures in accordance \nwith sound accounting principles.  All project accounts, including financial statement, statements \nof expenditures, and account records will be audited annually as part of the regular audit \naccounts  and  financial  statements.    District  and  city  accounts  will  be  audited  by  auditors \nacceptable to ADB, and consolidated at the provincial level.  The consolidated eight provincial \nand two national audit reports (one for MOH and one for BKKBN) will be submitted in English \nlanguage to ADB within 9 months after the end of the Government's fiscal year. \n \n75.  Reporting. The Government will coordinate and cooperate with ADB in reviewing the \nDHS2 and in this connection, will submit to ADB documents and reports that may be required. \nWithin 3 months after the loan closing date, the provinces and the Government will submit a \nproject completion report to ADB, in such form and detail as ADB may request. \n   \n76.  The CPCU will submit to ADB, within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter, \nconsolidated progress reports on the DHS2 in a form agreed upon by the Government and ADB.  \n \n77.  Social  Dimensions.  The  Borrower  will  ensure  that  the  DHS2  is  implemented  in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines for Incorporation of Social Dimensions in Bank Operations, \nand the following: \n(i)  Project  data  collected  by  participating  districts  will  provide  qualitative  and \nquantitative data on the poor and vulnerable groups living in the referenced \ngeographic  area  (including  internally  displaced  persons  and  indigenous \npeoples), disaggregated by gender. \n \n(ii)  The health information management system and performance monitoring system \nfor the DHS2 will provide gender disaggregated data and information. \n \n78.  Gender. Except as the Borrower and ADB may otherwise agree, the Borrower will \nensure that women constitute at least 50% of all persons trained pursuant to the DHS2's \nactivities and that this percentage is applied to each category of training program. The Borrower \nwill  ensure  that  the  gender  action  plan,  as  agreed  upon  by  the  Borrower  and  ADB,  is \nimplemented in all DHS2 activities. \n \n79.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement. The Borrower will ensure that, within 1 year of the \nloan effective date, all land acquisition and resettlement activities will have been completed in \naccordance  with  the  resettlement  framework  agreed  upon  by  the  Borrower  and  ADB;  the \nBorrower's laws, regulations, and procedures; and ADB's requirements as defined in ADB's \nPolicy on Involuntary Resettlement and the Handbook on Resettlement.  No civil works will \ncommence in any geographic area prior to completion of resettlement and income restoration \nactivities in that geographic area. ", " 19\n80.  Indigenous Peoples. The  Borrower  will  ensure  that  measures  are  undertaken  to \npromote  full  participation  of  indigenous  peoples  in  project  activities,  including  developing \nmechanisms to include indigenous peoples in capacity building and training under the DHS2.  \nThe PPMS developed under the DHS2 will include performance indicators that facilitate the \nmonitoring of participation of indigenous peoples in project activities.  The Borrower will ensure \nthat project activities are carried out in accordance with ADB's Policy on Indigenous Peoples \nand in accordance with the Action Plan for Indigenous Peoples and the Specific Action Plan for \nIndigenous Peoples, as agreed upon by the Borrower and ADB.    \n \n81.  Environment.  The  Borrower  will  ensure  that  an  initial  environmental  evaluation/ \nenvironmental impact assessment is prepared for each candidate subproject. Subprojects with a \nvalue of  $300,000 or less will be submitted to the relevant regional environment office for \napproval prior to subproject approval; subprojects with a value of more than $300,000 will be \nsubmitted for ADB approval prior to subproject approval. The Borrower will ensure that all \nactions  taken  as  a  result  of  the  DHS2  are  in  accordance  with  the  ADB's  Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines 2003 and all applicable Indonesian environmental laws and regulations.  \nThe  Borrower  will  ensure  that  MOH  and  BKKBN  strictly  apply  an  environmental  review \nprocedure, as agreed upon by the Borrower and ADB, when reviewing subprojects for approval.  \nThe  Borrower  will  cause  MOH  and  BKKBN  to  ensure  that  all  works  are  carried  out  in \naccordance with the approved initial environment evaluation and environmental management \nand monitoring plan. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n82.  The following are specified conditions to the effectiveness of the Loan Agreements: \n \n(i)  The Borrower will have prepared a detailed project administration memorandum \nacceptable to ADB; \n \n(ii)  The Borrower will have certified to ADB that budget approval documents for the \nloan and counterpart funds for the first year of project implementation have been \nissued  and  all  necessary  budget  approval  documents  for  ongranting  loan \nproceeds  to  at  least  40  participating  districts  have  been  approved  and \ndisseminated as needed for the DHS2 to commence activities;  \n \n(iii)  The  Borrower  will  furnish  a  decree  issued  on  project  implementation \narrangements satisfactory to ADB, clearly specifying (a) the respective roles and \nresponsibilities  of  MOF,  MOH,  BKKBN,  and  BAPPEDA  in  the  participating \nprovinces,  the  district  governments  of  the  participating  districts,  and  other \nrelevant agencies in implementation of the DHS2; and (b) the flow of funds \namong such parties. \n \n(iv)  The  Borrower  will  have  certified  that  all  arrangements  required  for  land \nacquisition and resettlement, if any, related to civil works during the first year of \nproject implementation have been addressed. \n \n(v)  The  Executing  Agency  will  have  made  recommendations  for  the  award  of \ncontracts for major consulting services that are to commence during the first year \nof project implementation. \n ", "20  \n(vi)  The central PIU will have been established and the executive secretaries and the \ntechnical advisor will have been appointed.  \n \n(vii)  The ordinary operations and special operations Loan Agreements, in form and \nsubstance satisfactory to ADB, will have been duly executed and delivered on \nbehalf of the Borrower and all conditions to their effectiveness have been fulfilled.  \n \n(viii)  Guidelines  for  implementing  the  PPMS,  satisfactory  to  ADB  in  form  and \nsubstance  and  including  requirements  for  poverty  and  gender  disaggregated \ndata,  will  have  been  developed  at  the  national  level  for  use  in  training  and \ncapacity-building project components and will be ready for implementation. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n83.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve: \n \n(i)  the  loan  of  $64.8  million  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Second \nDecentralized Health Services Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources with \ninterest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; \na term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan \nAgreement presented to the Board; and \n \n(ii)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 24,446,000 to \nthe Republic of Indonesia for the Second Decentralized Health Services Project \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \nAgreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \nTadao Chino \nPresident \n26 November 2003 ", "Appendix 1   21\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \nNarrative Summary  Performance Targets1  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nGoal  By 2010, in the project area:     \nImproved health status  (cid:131)  Millennium Development Goal  (cid:131)  Central Bureau Statistics   \nof the population,  (MDG): Child malnutrition2  and National Socio-\nespecially of poor and   From 34% (1995) to 22%  Economic Survey \nvulnerable groups   (cid:131)  MDG: Under-5 mortality rate3  (SUSENAS) data \n From 51 (2000) to 35  (cid:131)  National Family Planning \n(cid:131)  MDG: Infant mortality rate4  Coordinating Board \n From 41 (2000) to 25  (BKKBN) data  \n(cid:131)  MDG: Maternal mortality ratio:5  (cid:131)  United Nations Children\u2019s \nfrom 470 (1995) to 175  Fund (UNICEF) and World \n(cid:131)  Life expectancy at birth6   Health Organization \n at least 2 years more than local   (WHO) data \nbenchmark data  (cid:131)  Demographic and health \n  survey \n(cid:131)  Poverty line indicators \nfrom SUSENAS, World \nBank and BKKBN  \nPurpose  By the end of the Project (2010):     \nImproved health  (cid:131)  MDG: immunization against  (cid:131)  Annual district health  (cid:131)  Local economic \nservices in 8 provinces  measles: from 71%(1999) to  profiles  growth and sufficient \nand 90 districts and  85%   (cid:131)  BKKBN reports  revenues \ncities   (cid:131)  MDG: contraception prevalence  (cid:131)  Project quarterly Reports  (cid:131)  Health services are \nrate: from 57% (1999) to 70%  (cid:131)  Reports from Ministry of  essential to improve \n(cid:131)  MDG: at least 75% of population  Health (MOH), BKKBN,  health status of the \nwith access to essential drugs   other externally-assisted  population and make \n(cid:131)  MDG: Births attended by skilled  projects  people able to \nstaff: from 64% (1999) to 80%  participate in the \n(cid:131)  MDG: detected tuberculosis  development of the \ncases: from 20% (2000) to 50%  nation \nOutputs       \n1.

Tuberculosis is a priority health problem in Indonesia causing a disease burden nearly \ndouble that of neighboring countries. Nearly 600,000 new cases occur each year, amounting to \n280 new cases per 100,000 people, including 126 smear positive pulmonary cases per 100,000. \nEstimates show that only 20% of pulmonary tuberculosis is detected. Of those detected with \ntuberculosis, an estimated 87% were successfully treated.6 \n \n7.   More than 50% of the population lives in malaria-free areas where transmission does not \nexist or occurs only sporadically. Malaria is a health problem in forest areas of the outer islands, \nparticularly in the eastern provinces, where 50% of the cases are plasmodium falciparum. More \nthan 1.5 million clinical cases are reported outside Java annually. Malaria control activities are \nintegrated  with  the  general  health  services.  Overall  responsibility  for  implementing  malaria \ncontrol activities lies with district governments. Passive case detection, clinical diagnosis and \ntreatment, active case detection and laboratory diagnosis are limited to the Java-Bali area. \nMalaria cases are treated at health centers, private practices, and malaria treatment posts of \nvolunteers in the rural areas. The spread of drug resistance, a lack of resources, and a lack of \nintersector collaboration and trained professional staff are some of the major issues. \n \n8.   The population at risk of malaria is around 100 million (46.2% of the population). Based \non the malaria incidence, Indonesia is divided into two regions, Java and Bali, with 70% of the \ntotal Indonesian population, where malaria is hypoendemic, and the other sparsely populated \nislands where malaria is at much higher levels. More than 3.3 million clinical cases of malaria \nwere reported in 1998 by government health centers and hospitals. As only 20% of sick people \ngo to the government facilities, an estimated 15 million malaria cases probably occur annually. \nThe loss of individual income from malaria is estimated at $56.5 million per year, not including \nthe loss from tourism and foregone business investment in malaria endemic areas.  \n                                                 \n5  WHO. 2002.

An expanded program on immunization had been implemented since 1978, and the \ncoverage increased rapidly. Indonesia achieved the universal child immunization level by 1990 \nat the national level and in all provinces in 1994, but only around 65% districts achieved that \nlevel by 1997. Despite a \"universal\" level of immunization nationwide, vaccine preventable \ndiseases still occurred in several areas. Recently, a more sensitive indicator called \u201cproportion \nof high risk villages\u201d was introduced to define the intensive program intervention areas (high-risk \narea approach). \n \n10.  The  epidemiological  transition  places  a  double  burden  on  the  health  system:  while \ncommunicable diseases remain major public health issues, non-communicable diseases are \nincreasing  (e.g.,  over  40%  of  outpatient  cases  at  the  health  center  level  are  there  for \nhypertension, asthma, etc). Smoking is a major contributor to these diseases but there is little \npolitical  will  to  develop  strategies  to  counter  the  trend.  Degenerative  and  non-contagious \ndiseases also show a rising trend.  The results of the National Household Health Survey of 1995 \nshow that 83 persons per 1,000 people suffer from hypertension, and 2 to 3 persons per 1,000 \npeople from ischemic heart disease and stroke.  Emotional disturbances among people aged 5\u2013\n14 years old and above 15 are 104 and 140 per 1,000 people, respectively.  Blindness is rising \nsignificantly, from 1.0% in 1982 to 1.47% in 1995.  Mortality due to traffic accidents increased \nfrom 3.2 per 100,000 people in 1994 to 4.1 per 100,000 people in 1997. \n \n11.  The prevalence of moderate and severe protein energy malnutrition among children \nunder 5 years had dropped from 18.9% in 1978 to 14.6% in 1995.  The total prevalence of \nprotein energy malnutrition decreased from 48.2% in 1978 to 35.0% in 1995.  So did the other \nnutritional problems decline, such as blindness due to vitamin A deficiency, iron deficiency \nanemia,  and  iodine  deficiency.  A  1992  survey  concluded  that  blindness  due  to  vitamin  A \ndeficiency was no longer a community health problem. The National Socioeconomic Survey \ndisclosed that the prevalence of pregnant women suffering from iron deficiency had decreased \nfrom 63.5% in 1992 to 50.5% in 1995.  Among the preschool-age group, iron deficiency went \ndown from 55.5% to 40.5%.  Iodine deficiency disease declined because 80% of households \nused iodized salt.  \n \n12.  The issue of malnutrition, however, needs to be further discussed in the light of the \naftermath of 1997 economic crisis and the start of the decentralization process in 2001, as its \ntransition period had upset distribution programs. Groups at highest risk are children 5\u201312 \nmonths. Maternal malnutrition and anemia are concerns for over 50% children 5\u201314 and women \nof  reproductive  age.  The  National  Socio-economic  Survey  (Susenas)  2001  showed  that \nprevalence of stunting under-five is 34.3%, wasting under-five is 16.6%, under-five children with \nanemia is 47.8%. These programs will need to be strengthened at the local levels.   \n \nC.  Accuracy of the Health Data \n \n13.

Poverty and Social Analysis \n \n1.  Poverty levels that had been falling since the late 1970s increased rapidly during 1998 \nand 1999 due to the effects of the financial crisis and natural disasters. Poverty as measured by \nthe head count index had fallen from a high level of above 40% in 1976 to about 15% before the \ncrisis in mid-1997. High prices for staple food and basic commodities as result of the crisis \nincreased poverty levels to 33% in November 1998. In 2001, the national average percentage of \npoor was 16% but differed widely among provinces, from below 10% in South Kalimantan and \nthe new province of Bangka Belitung to approximately 40% in NTT and the new province of \nGorontalo. Poverty is substantially higher in rural areas of all provinces. Table A11 shows the \npoverty rate of provinces that will participate in the Project.  \n \nTable A11: Poverty Rate by Province (percentage of population) \n  1996  1999  2001 \nProvince  Total  Urban  Rural  Total  Urban  Rural  Total \nBangka Belitung  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  7.90  8.25  8.10 \nCentral Kalimantan  13.50  5.64  18.54  15.06  4.82  18.03  14.40 \nEast Nusa Tenggara  38.89  29.20  49.39  46.73  21.64  43.54  40.15 \nGorontalo  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  23.66  45.56  39.97 \nSouth Kalimantan  8.53  10.41  16.16  14.37  6.46  9.01  8.12 \nSouth Sulawesi  16.71  18.26  18.35  18.32  10.25  16.87  14.95 \nSouth Sumatra  15.89  23.99  23.32  23.53  16.25  18.33  17.62 \nWest Nusa Tenggara  31.97  31.93  33.21  32.96  24.75  24.21  24.40 \n\u2013 = not available. \nSource: 2001. National Socioeconomic Survey. \n \n2.  Poor people are unable to meet their minimum nutritional requirements and tend to \nsuffer from low educational attainment and insufficient skills. Consequently, they may be able to \nfind only impermanent work that provides low and uncertain wages in the informal sector. Most \nof the poor do not have access to basic infrastructure and services like adequate shelter and \nsanitation and safe water. The poor have only very limited access to comprehensive health \ncare, use the services of health centers for maternal and child care infrequently, and bear a \ndisproportionate burden of health costs in relation to their spending capacity.   \n \n3.  Village  health  posts,  health  centers,  mobile  health  centers,  village  midwives,  and \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) generally cater to the needs of the poor. District hospitals \nare obliged by law to provide 25% of services free of costs for the poor who are in possession of \nhealth cards (surat miskin), issued by the administration to certify the poverty status. But in \nmany rural areas health service facilities are outside the reach of the poor and are often of low \nquality. Access remains an issue for poor people and their health expenditures consist of out-of-\npocket payments.  \n \n4.  As the poor cannot afford private health services, except from NGOs, low quality and \nlimited access to public health services affect their health. Child malnutrition rates in Indonesia \nare  high  (i.e.,  8.74%  are  mildly  malnourished  and  0.61%  of  the  population  are  severely \nmalnourished)1 and malnutrition remains a serious problem for vulnerable groups. Malnutrition \nrates among children from poorer households are still well above those of other segments of the \npopulation. The 2001 survey (footnote 1) showed that the prevalence of stunting under 5 years \nof age is 34.3%, wasting is 16.6%, and anemia is 47.8% for the same age group. \n                                                 \n1 Central Bureau of Statistics. 2001. National Socio-Economic Survey. Jakarta. ", "     Appendix 9    39\n \n5.  Use of health services in a timely and efficient way depends on the knowledge and \nawareness of households about available health services and determines their health seeking \nbehavior.  The  level  of  education  of  mothers  affects  the  demand  for  primary  health  care, \nincluding  maternal  and  childcare.  Although  literacy  and  years  of  schooling  have  generally \nincreased during the past 3 decades, access to health services is still difficult for many rural \npeople  due  to  transport  problems.  The  average  distance  to  a  health  care  facility  was  5 \nkilometers in 2002. The subdistrict level health center is the most accessible health service \nfacility for the population at large, followed by private physicians, other private health providers \nlike traditional birth attendants and healers, auxiliary subdistrict health centers, and village\u2013\nowned comprehensive health posts.  \n \nB.  Participation Strategies \n6.  Strategies to promote participation of communities and nongovernment organizations in \nthe Second Decentralized Health Services Project (DHS2) activities are focusing on regional \nhealth committees that will ensure participation (i) in the preparation of annual plans and in the \nimplementation  of  Project  activities;  (ii)  activities  related  to  supervision,  monitoring,  and \nevaluation of DHS2 activities; and (iii) in licensing and accreditation of services and personnel. \nTechnical assistance provided by the DHS2 will promote these participation strategies and \nadvocate institutionalization of participatory implementation mechanisms of the DHS2. \n \nC.

Women\u2019s access to health care is important to their direct health care needs and those \nof their family, as women tend to be responsible for the care of the young, the sick, and the \nelderly. Thus, women\u2019s access to health care extends beyond the welfare of the individual to \nthat of the family as a whole. Maternal mortality is a major issue in Indonesia, with a maternal \nmortality ratio estimated at 390 women\u2019s deaths per 100,000 live births. Maternal morbidity also \nis  significant,  with  an  estimated  55.5%  of  pregnant  women  suffering  from  anemia.  Family \nplanning gives women greater control over their destiny. While the crisis did not result in an \noverall decline of the contraceptive prevalence rate, reversals were experienced in the DHS2 \nprovinces.  \n  \n8.  The DHS2 is particularly targeting female infants, girls under 5 years of age, teen-age \ngirls and mothers, pregnant women, postmenopausal women that have special health needs \ncaused  by  the  menopausal  syndrome,  and  elderly  women  suffering  from  diseases  like \nosteoporosis, nutrition problems, and cancer. Women in rural areas will benefit from several \nDHS2 activities, in particular the upgrading of primary health services; the implementation of the \nsafe  motherhood  program;  expansion  of  the  \"making  pregnancy  safer\"  program;  the \nimprovement  of  training  institutions  for  nurses,  and  midwives;  the  development  of  health \nprevention and promotion programs; and information, education, and communication for health \nand family planning. Groups of poor women belonging to the Family Planning Association will \nreceive financial assistance from the DHS2 in the form of seed money for income-generating \nactivities.  Women  will  be  trained  as  facilitators  to  pass  on  messages  on  improved  health \npractices at the community level in poor areas. Traditional female birth attendants will be \ntargeted for training in health promotion and nutrition activities, facilitating their new role as \nassistants to village midwives. \n \nD.  Gender Strategy  ", "40 Appendix 10 \n9.  A gender strategy has been developed for DHS2 (Supplementary Appendix A presents \nthe  full  strategy).  The  basic  principles  applied  in  the  DHS2  regarding  gender  sensitive \nmechanisms are (i) equal project benefits and opportunity sharing between women and men; (ii) \nreduction of gender inequalities in the project areas by ensuring equal participation for women \nand men in project activities; (iii) a targeted approach for very poor women; (iv) collection of \ngender-disaggregated data included in the benefit monitoring and evaluation; (v) increase of the \nnumber of female trainers and health professionals and female participation of at least 50% in \nall categories of training funded by the DHS2; and (vi) promotion of representation of women in \ndecision-making bodies at all levels. \n \n10.  The DHS2 will introduce the concept of health planning needs being based on sex-\ndisaggregated data and on monitoring indicators that are gender sensitive. The DHS2 will \nreview data collection methodologies and revise them accordingly. Health personnel will be \ntrained in understanding the importance of gender for improved health services.  \n \n11.  DHS2 capacity-building activities at the district and city level will include the following: (i) \ndata collection and monitoring formats will be reviewed and revised to ensure data is sex-\ndisaggregated and monitoring indicators are gender sensitive; (ii) a 50% target will be set for \nwomen\u2019s participation in clinical and managerial skills training; (iii) regional governments will be \nencouraged to select women for managerial and administrative positions; (iv) women will be \nselected by the DHS2 as trainers and facilitators; (v) female cadres will be specifically trained to \ndisseminate family planning methods in poor neighborhoods; and (vi) traditional birth attendants \nwill be trained to actively support village midwives in identifying high-risk cases and promote \nbreast feeding and nutrition programs during pregnancy.  \n \n12.  Women will be involved in the identification of health needs, and women\u2019s groups will be \nrecruited to help in health promotion activities and data collection. Women's groups will also be \ninvolved  in  monitoring  implementation  of  the  DHS2  at  the  district  level.  Specific  targeted \ninterventions will be identified during implementation of the DHS2 by the gender consultant. The \ngender consultant will identify additional context-specific gender issues at the local level and \nfacilitate the implementation of the gender strategy. The gender consultant will also identify \nspecific gender sensitive indicators. \n \nE.  Indigenous Peoples \n \n13.  Indigenous peoples are not likely to be adversely or significantly affected by the DHS2. \nOn the contrary, specific mechanisms have been included in the project design to ensure that \nindigenous peoples will benefit from the DHS2. The DHS2 will ensure that (i) district health \nplans include an assessment of the needs of indigenous peoples, (ii) constraints for indigenous \npeoples\u2019 participation in benefiting from project activities will be addressed, (iii) community \nparticipation  in  implementation  of  project  activities  will  include  indigenous  peoples  where \nrelevant, and (iv) monitoring mechanism include impact of the DHS2 on indigenous peoples.  \n \nF.  Resettlement \n14.  The DHS2 may include rehabilitation and/or construction of health posts for village \nmidwives, health centers, and district hospitals in selected districts. It is highly unlikely that the \nrehabilitation of health posts and health centers will require any land acquisition. Nevertheless, \na resettlement framework has been prepared (Supplementary Appendix B), to regulate \ncompensation and procedures in accordance with Government regulations and the Involuntary \nResettlement Policy of Asian Development Bank.   ", "     Appendix 11    41\nSUMMARY POVERTY AND SOCIAL ASSESSMENT REPORT FORM \n \nA.  Identification of poor and vulnerable groups  \n \nNumber of poor and vulnerable groups (women/men) expected to benefit from the intervention:  \n \nNumber of poor:1 The total estimated number of poor females to benefit from the Second Decentralized Health \nServices Project (DHS2) will be 1.990 million and poor males 1.969, by the end of the fifth year of the DHS2. The \npoor are defined according to the National Bureau of Statistics poverty line. They will be identified for targeting \naccording to the National Family Planning Coordinating Board (BKKBN) criteria for identifying the pre-prosperous \nhouseholds, as applied for Social Safety Net Progam\u2013Health.  This process will be supported by advocacy activities \nat the district level to ensure improved participatory mechanisms for identifying the poor and providing improved \naccess to health care and family planning services.    \n \nNumber vulnerable to poverty: The population vulnerable to poverty in the eight project provinces that will benefit \nfrom the DHS2 will be approximately 2.4 million females and 2.2 million males by the fifth year of the DHS2, \nassuming that the maximum benefit flows and maximum district participation will occur by that time.  Vulnerability to \npoverty is defined as the proportion of the population that is expected to have high variance and low expected and \npresent consumption (SMERU 2001). \n \n \n \nB.  Poverty and Social Analysis    \n \nPoor women and men will benefit from the project by improved availability and quality of maternal and child health, \nante- and pre-natal programs, quality of delivery care, programs to assist better care-seeking behavior, and control \nof communicable and childhood illnesses.  \n \nStrategies to ensure that the needs of poor and vulnerable groups are addressed include participatory health \nplanning focusing on improved access for the poor to health facilities and on improved quality of services.   \n \nPoor and vulnerable groups will be involved in planning and priority setting regarding monitoring and evaluation and \nregarding customer satisfaction and quality assurance surveys.  \n  \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \n Participatory methods have been applied to identify needs of the poor and underserved through focus groups, rapid \nappraisals, and surveys. \n  \nPeriodic surveys will be conducted to determine the flow of benefits to the poor and vulnerable, awareness of \navailability of services among the poor and vulnerable, and assessments of changes in care seeking and health \nseeking behavior.                \n \nD.        Gender \n \nSummary of Gender Analysis: Females and males are expected to benefit and participate in equal proportion.  \nSpecial gender concerns relate to the health needs of would-be and recent mothers and the special issue of \nmaternal mortality.  Maternal mortality is high in Indonesia compared with other East Asian countries. The burden of \ndisease impacts females disproportionately, as seen in the total disability-adjusted life years lost due to morbidity \nand mortality.  Services in maternal and child health will be an important focus of the DHS2.  Training initiatives of \nthe DHS2 are designed for women to be 50% of the participants. Sex-disaggregated data will be developed to \nensure that health planning is gender responsive. Training in understanding gender aspects and the importance for \nimproved health services  will be introduced as  well.  A gender strategy  has been prepared for the DHS2 \n(Supplementary Appendix A).  \n1 The provincial poverty ratio (headcount poverty) for 2001 is estimated using National Socioeconomic Survey \n(Susenas) and Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) poverty line for 1999 inflated using price index supplied by BPS \nand applying it to the estimated provincial population. The Second Decentralized Health Services Project is \nassumed to reach a maximum of 75% of the poor in each province, a conservative estimate, when the full effect of \nthe project invests is obtained by years 5\u20136.

Introduction \n \n1.  The  Second  Decentralized  Health  Services  Project  (DHS2)  is  considered  to  be  in \nEnvironmental Category B, i.e. a limited number of specific environmental and social impacts \nmay result from project implementation but can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally \nrecognized  performance  standards,  guidelines,  or  design  criteria.  The  following  potential \nenvironmental, health, safety, and social impacts of the DHS2 were analyzed: \n \n(i)  The comprehensiveness of the waste management plans, including handling and \ndisposal of medical and biohazardous waste; \n(ii)  Liquid waste and sewage disposal; \n(iii)  Management of construction impacts over the planned building period (sediment \nand erosion control, emissions, noise, traffic, worker health and safety); \n(iv)  Hygiene and implementation of good hospital management practices; and \n(v)  Employee\u2019s health and safety training. \n \nB.  Brief Description of the Project \n2.  The  project  objective  is  to  improve  the  health  and  family  planning  status  of  the \npopulation, especially of poor and vulnerable groups in 8 provinces: Bangka-Belitung, Central \nKalimantan,  East  Nusa  Tenggara,  Gorontalo,  South  Kalimantan,  South  Sulawesi,  South \nSumatra, and West Nusa Tenggara. The DHS2 will contribute to (i) improving, supporting, and \nstrengthening the local capacity of health and family planning service delivery; (ii) planning, \nbudgeting, managing, financing, and ensuring of access to equitable services for the poor and \nvulnerable;  (iii)  improving  of  the  efficiency,  effectiveness  and  quality  of  health  and  family \nplanning services; (iv) improved knowledge, attitudes, practices, performance, and productivity \nof health professionals; and (v) improved participation of the community, including the poor and \nvulnerable groups, in voicing their needs and priorities to the relevant health professionals. \n \n3.  The health care system in Indonesia follows the administrative structure of the public \nsector. Primary health care (PHC) is provided through subdistrict level health centers. These \ncenters have in turn, several auxiliary health centers at the village level. Contracted village \nmidwives supervised by the local health center are working at the community level in village-\nowned  birthing  posts  (Pos  Persalinan  Desa\u2014POLINDES).  Health  referrals  are  handled  at \ndistrict hospitals, which have 50\u2013200 beds. Further referrals are handled at provincial or central-\nlevel general hospitals and national specialty hospital centers. \n \n4.  Civil work activities to be funded by the DHS2 include: \n \n(i)  Construction of new general hospitals; \n(ii)  Construction of new auxiliary health centers and birthing posts; \n(iii)  Renovation of general health facility buildings, family planning facilities, auxiliary \nhealth centers and birthing posts; \n(iv)  Renovation and new construction of health training centers; \n(v)  Renovation and construction of regional health offices buildings; and \n(vi)  Renovation and new construction of doctor's and paramedic's housing.  \n ", "44 Appendix 12 \n5.  During the first year of the DHS2, a survey will be undertaken to make a detailed \ninventory of existing facilities and their use and to develop flexible standard designs. The survey \nwill cover all issues related to environmental evaluation of hospitals, auxiliary health centers and \nhealth  training  centers.  Environmental  issues  related  to  the  construction  of  a  new  district \nhospital in Tanah Bumbu, South Kalimantan are similar to those of other new general hospitals \nincluded in the DHS2. Rehabilitation of Pangkalpinang City general hospital in Bangka Belitung \nis also an example of renovation work for hospitals financed under the DHS2. Renovation of \nPangkalan Balai district health centers in Banyuasin, South Sumatera and reconstruction of the \nKuin Raya district health centers, Banjarmasin, South Kalimantan are examples of the health \ncenter\u2019s renovation needed because of the bad condition of the facility and the increased \nnumber of functions of health centers in the framework of the DHS2. Environmental issues at \nthe health centers are similar to those for hospitals, albeit at a much smaller scale.  \n \nC.  Description of the Environment  \n \n1.  Climate \n6.  The tropical climate in the eight provinces has dry and wet seasons. The accumulative \nannual rainfall and the temperature levels vary widely. Temperatures usually range between \n26oC and 32oC, also depending on elevation from sea level. Wind direction always reverses \nevery 6 months. South of the equator, the wind direction during wet season from September to \nFebruary is from west to east, and from east to west during the dry season from March to \nAugust. The reverse is found north of the equator. \n \n2.  Physical Resources \n7.  The proposed new Tanah Bumbu district hospital in South Kalimantan is located on 8 \nhectares of land facing the existing Batulicin subdistrict health center provided by the Tanah \nBumbu district government. The site is on dry highlands of the small Batulicin City, and slopes \nto the east (rear), ideal for the drainage system. The hospital will be constructed in three \nphases, and will eventually have 200 beds. The hospital facilities consist of out-patient clinics, \nemergency  facility,  intensive  care  unit,  general  wards,  delivery  ward,  operating  theater, \nlaboratory,  radiology,  medical  records,  administration,  general  services,  kitchen,  laundry, \nmortuary, workshop, incinerator, solid waste temporary storage area, other required public \nfacilities, and housing for doctors and paramedics. \n \n8.  The  180-bed  Pangkalpinang  City  general  hospital  will  be  renovated.  Buildings  and \nfacilities are old and need rehabilitation. The hospital is in the south part of the city, near the \nairport. The area is free from floods. The soil consists of dry red podzolic, regosol, gleisol, and \norganosol layers. The site slopes to the east ideal for the drainage system. \n \n9.  Banyuasin is a new district, formerly part of Musi Banyuasin. Pangkalan Balai is the \ncapital, but does not have a hospital. Health services are provided by the Pangkalan Balai \nhealth center with six beds, but this is insufficient. Traffic accident victims or patients needing \nhospital care must be transferred to Palembang (more than 40 kilometers away). Pangkalan \nBalai health center needs improved facilities before being transformed into a general hospital. \n \n10.  The Kuin Raya subdistrict health center, in Banjarmasin, South Kalimantan provides \noutpatient health care services. Patient attendance is high, but the services are inadequate. \nInpatient  service  will  be  developed  because  the  center  is  located  in  a  poor  and  densely ", "     Appendix 12    45\npopulated area. The center is in an old building built of temporary material on swampy ground \nwhere high tides often inundate the surroundings. \n \n11.  There are no significant surface water problems in Batulicin, Pangkalan Balai or Pangkal \nPinang. Clean water is supplied from protected ground water sources or a municipal water \ncompany. The Kuin Raya center's location is a problem for accessing clean water and because \nmosquitoes breed in the area. \n \n12.  No observed environmentally sensitive areas are in the proposed DHS2 sites. \n \n13.  The outdoor and indoor air quality is satisfactory at almost all the proposed civil works \nlocations. However, long dry periods may be dusty, and airborne particulates can affect the air \nquality negatively, especially in health facilities near busy roads with active traffic movement. \nAdequate planting of trees around the health facilities can help reduce the problem.  \n \n14.  Groundwater may be used at most locations. Several locations need accurate geo-\nelectric sounding to determine the best location for wells. Adequate laboratory testing is needed \nto determine the extent of processing needed. Where groundwater is not suitable for use, clean \nwater needs to be transported if municipal water mains are not available. Clean and adequate \nwater supplies for the centers and housing need to be carefully ensured. \n \n3.  Ecological Resources \n15.  The vegetation at most health facilities is well maintained, except in Kuin Raya, where \ntides and dense population make vegetation care difficult. The proposed hospital location in \nBatulicin has no tall trees, and no flora that need to be conserved.  \n \n16.  No endangered species, wildlife, and wildlife habitat were identified on the premises or \nsurrounding area of the DHS2 health facilities. The wildlife identified were limited to common \nwild birds; mammals (cats, rats, and small rodents); and insects (ants, cockroaches, flies, and \nbees). \n \n4.  Human and Economic Development \n17.  Batu  Licin,  the  capital  of  Tanah  Bumbu  district,  has  not  yet  adequate  community \nsanitation facilities. The new hospital will have to develop its own wastewater treatment system \narea. Most hospitals need a diesel generator as electricity outages occur, due to the limited \nresources  of  the  state  electricity  company.  Many  health  centers  are  not  connected  to  an \nelectricity source. Vaccines are stored in kerosene-powered cold storage.  \n \nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures  \n18.  Present  environmental  laws  and  Ministry  of  Health  and  Ministry  of  Environment \nregulations and guidelines provide sufficient safeguards for the environmentally safe operation \nof health facilities. Enforcement of the regulations needs improvement. \n \n19.  Medical waste from hospitals and health centers should be burned in incinerators or \nother  high  temperature  furnaces.  This  needs  the  serious  attention  of  the  health  facility \nmanagement because careful handling is essential. \n ", "46 Appendix 12 \n20.  Hospital and health center wastewater should go a wastewater treatment plant before \ndraining to the open environment or public sewerage, or absorption into the ground. The size of \nthe plant needs to be carefully calculated by the architect or contractor, taking into consideration \nthe actual load posed by patients, relatives, visitors, and health personnel. A plant for a health \ncenter may be a simple septic tank, as long as local ground conditions are also taken into \nconsideration in the design of the effluent absorption area.  \n \n21.  Construction  Phase.  Adverse  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the \nimplementation of civil works will be minimal, short-term, and mitigated by appropriate design \nand project management of facilities construction and operation. Trees near health facilities will \nbe replanted, and other vegetation restored.  \n \n22.  Indoor Quality And Energy Efficiency. To ensure good indoor quality, the building \ndesign should incorporate a natural lighting and tropical climate ventilation system as much as \npossible.  Whenever  natural  ventilation  is  inadequate,  fans  and  air  conditioning  may  be \nemployed. In-patient facilities need to be designed to avoid the spread of contamination and \ninfections  among  patients.  Energy  efficiency  can  be  achieved  if  all  users  economize  on \nelectricity usage. This entails adequate socialization and enforcement by the management for \nall concerned (staff, patients, visitors, and other personnel). Other energy saving measures \ninclude the use of solar water heating and automatic switching for open public area lighting.  \n \n23.  Green Gas Emissions. Incinerators need to be carefully chosen to ensure that the \nrecommended working temperature can always be achieved. Incinerators and back-up diesel \ngenerators need to be kept in good condition to ensure complete combustion that helps keep \nthe environment clean. Their location and exhaust stacks need to be carefully designed to \nminimize  noise  and  smoke  pollution.  The  use  of  renewable  energy  sources  is  preferable \nwhenever technically and economically feasible. Solar energy is still prohibitively expensive as \nthe equipment is not readily available and there are no trained personnel able to maintain it. \n \n24.  Institutional  Requirements  and  Environmental  Monitoring  Program.  Existing \nenvironmental laws and regulations form the basis for collection and disposal of medical waste. \nEnvironment monitoring and evaluation activities of the health facility and its surrounding area \nwill follow the existing standards. Engineers will incorporate environmental impact mitigation \nmeasures into the technical design of DHS2 facilities. Construction and operation phases will \ninclude  mitigation  measures  as  needed.  Engineers  will  be  responsible  for  developing  an \nenvironmental  management  plan  for  each  subproject,  which  will  summarize  proposed \nenvironmental mitigation activities, including time-bound action plan, containing performance \nevaluation of specific environmental, health, and safety activities as reflected in the results of \nperiodic and quantitative sampling and measuring programs. The provincial and district health \noffice, the local environmental impact management agency (BAPEDAL) and the Ministry of \nHealth will provide technical guidance in preparing the plan following national guidelines.  \n \n25.  A committee to monitor the quality of civil works and environment will be set up at each \ndistrict and city in order to monitor and evaluate compliance according to the EMP milestones. \nThe committee will be composed of a DHS2 district coordinator, the local BAPEDAL, and the \ndistrict health office. Periodic site supervision visits will also be conducted. The committee\u2019s \nreport will be a part of the project progress report. ", "     Appendix 13    47\nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS \nA.  Economic Analysis \n \n1.  Economic Rationale \n \n1.  The Second Decentralized Health Services Project (DHS2) focuses on improving the \nrole  of  government  in  the  sector  in  a  decentralized  context.  Decentralization  offers  new \nopportunities to strengthen health and family planning services in the regions through locally \nadapted  reforms  giving  health  services  providers  more  appropriate  incentives,  skills, \nsupervision, material support, and discretionary authority needed to offer high quality services, \nand providing clients with information, financial means, and bargaining power required to elicit \nappropriate responses. Investments are needed to help the regions and the central Government \nplan, implement, manage, monitor, and evaluate a range of programs and activities. DHS2 will \nstrengthen capacity at district, provincial, and national levels for the delivery of health services.  \nIt will include planning and management to ensure universal access to good quality health and \nfamily planning services, and to improve quality, cost efficiency, and sustainability of health and \nfamily planning services in the DHS2 area. The initial advocacy, training, and technical support \nwill build up commitment and capacity of regional governments. The leading role of the public \nhealth sector in decentralization will require strong support and participation from a variety of \nstakeholders. The DHS2 will also address the increasingly important role of the private health \nsector, the professional associations, and the community in the organization and governance of \nthe health system. The primary focus of the DHS2 will be poor and vulnerable groups, and the \nunderserved.  DHS2\u2019s support to primary health care (PHC) will play a key role in the decrease \nof maternal and infant mortality, and general morbidity. \n \n2.  Economic Benefits \n2.  The DHS2 is expected to yield several benefits.  These include improved health status in \nthe  provinces  and  districts  through  increased  spending  for  health,  better  prioritization  and \ntargeting of health services, improved resource mobilization, enhanced service quality, and \nbetter access for vulnerable groups. Regional authorities informed of local concerns will devise \nmore cost-efficient health service delivery systems. The DHS2 increases the economic benefits \nof  decentralization  at  the  provincial  and  district  levels  through  capacity  building,  physical \ninvestment, and reforms. While there may be savings in the health reforms, such savings will be \ndirected to increasing subsidies to the poor. Health promotion activities will also be targeted \ntowards women and the poor to increase health status.  \n \n3.   The DHS2 is expected to contribute to the reduction in the burden disease measured by \nthe reduction in disability adjusted life years (DALYs) lost due to death and disability.  Project \nbenefits have been estimated in terms of reduction of the gap in DALY between the project \nprovinces and developed countries, multiplied by the 2002 per capita regional minimum wages.  \nData  derived  from  the  1993  World  Development  Report1  indicates  that  the  gap  in  DALY \nbetween non-Indian and Chinese Asian countries and established market economies was about \n143 per 1000 population.  The gap in DALY is estimated by disaggregating the major disease \ncategories, using relatively recent burden of disease data from previous health projects. The \nvalue of a DALY saved in each province is the monetary value of the minimum wage levels in \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 1993. World Development Report. Washington DC. ", "48 Appendix 13 \nthe province2.  For DHS2, the maximum benefit effect assumes a reduction of the gap by 7.4 \nDALYs per 1,000 population. This will be achieved through:  \n \n(i)  DHS2  activities  directed  towards  improved  clinical  quality  will  impact  the \ntreatment of communicable and noncommunicable diseases, improve the quality \nof family planning services, and injury related clinical services. This is estimated \nto reduce the DALY difference between Organization for Economic Cooperation \nand Development market economies and Indonesia by 1.9%. \n \n(ii)  Efficiency of the health system will be improved through better allocation of health \npersonnel.    This  will  free  resources  to  improve  clinical  and  family  planning \nservices  and  to  target  subsidies  to  the  poor,  women,  and  children,  thereby \nincreasing their access to health services. This is assumed to reduce the DALY \ngap by 1.6%. \n \n(iii)  Locally managed health services will result in more targeted and appropriate \nservice  provision.  Health  promotion  and  family  planning programs  will  be  an \nimportant part of the local health system. Nutritional and vehicle safety education \nprograms are two activities related to areas with large DALY differences between \nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development economies and \nIndonesia. This is estimated to reduce the DALY gap by 1.7%. \n \n4.  The cumulative maximum benefit of 7.4% DALY reduction proposed in DHS2 compares \nto the estimated 11.5 percent DALY reduction in the World Bank-supported Provincial Health \nProject I and the 4% DALY reduction estimated for the Decentralized Health Services Project.  \nEconomic benefits are based on the assumption that health services contribute 20% to health \nimprovement, while the generic impact of behavior change is 35%. These values have been \nderived from a wide range of projects and health impacts over time, by computing output \nrelationships for health system investments and behavior change investments.  \n \n3.  Economic Internal Rates of Return and Net Present Value \n \n5.  DHS2 expects to yield a composite economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 37%, with \nproject provinces economic rates of return ranging from 21.5% (East Nusa Tenggara) to 50.2% \n(South Sumatra).  \n \n(i)  The period of analysis covers a 20-year period (2004-2023), carried out in \nconstant 2002 prices, with domestic prices used as numeraire.   \n(ii)  Economic costs were calculated based on the annual project cost disbursements.  \nIncremental recurrent costs were estimated at about 5% of capital costs (civil \nworks and equipment).  Project funds are expended over a six-year period. \n \n6.  Tradable goods of capital and operation and maintenance costs were adjusted based on \na shadow exchange rate factor of 1.20.3 Tradable goods are estimated to be about 40% of \nproject costs. At a discount rate of 12%, the net present value (NPV) of the flow of costs and \nbenefits is $111,656,718. The analysis indicates that the economic benefits will result from \ninfluences  that  lead  to  reductions  in  disease  burden  and  related  DALYs.

Financial Sustainability and Fiscal Impact  \n \n7.  The DHS2 comprises investment and capacity building components.  Financial rate of \nreturn is not calculated since investment is on PHC, considered as core poverty reduction \nactivities,4 and user charges will not be applied in the investment project. Hence, cost recovery \nis not al factor in the project design. The financial analysis focuses on the fiscal impact of the \nDHS2 on regional government budgets. Sustainability analysis of funding for project activities \nbeyond the closing date is also presented. \n \n8.  Government health expenditure is low by international standards. Chronically low funding \nof public health services has affected service quality and effectiveness, which in turn have had \n                                                 \n4   54 of the 90 project districts have low fiscal capacity based on 2003 data. ", "50 Appendix 13 \nan impact on the use of public health services and the health status of the population.   In \nselected provinces in the country, district allocations for health are only about two to eight \npercent of the local health budget.5 Hence, it is essential that health service delivery achieve (i) \ngreater  cost-efficiency  in  resource  allocation,  and  (ii)  increased  resource  mobilization. \nInvestments in PHC and family planning services are a cost-effective means of providing quality \nPHC  services.  Rationalizing  personnel,  increasing  public-private  partnership,  and  resource \nmobilization are the proposed reform options for the districts and provinces. Better public-private \npartnership also will get the private sector more involved in health care financing, managed care \nand other reforms. \n \n9.  About 30% of the DHS2 will be financed by the national Government and the loan \nproceeds will be forwarded to the regions as a grant (ongranting mechanisms). From a total cost \nof $143 million, the Government will finance about $43.0 million. The Government\u2019s annual \nshare in project costs will average around $7.2 million during the project period. The recurrent \ncosts to be borne by the Government during the DHS2 are estimated to be about $1.6 million \nper year.  DHS2 is designed to minimize recurrent cost implications for the Government and the \ncommunity. The improvement of the quality and management support systems in DHS2 is \nintended  to  improve  the  internal  efficiency  of  the  health  system.  The  development  of  a \nappropriate and improved system will result in an efficient use of resources and an effective \ndelivery of health services. The costs associated with system development are one time costs to \nsupport  reforms,  and  therefore  the  incremental  costs  from  the  DHS2  are  negligible  and \nsustainable. \n \n10.  Based on project disbursements, projections were made to assess the annual district \nhealth expenditure as a result of the incremental project investment so that the Government is \npresented with a clear funding commitment. Currently, in the eight provinces supported by the \nproject, there is a wide variation both within and across provinces in health spending.  In most of \nthe project districts, the levels of health spending are about 1 to 2% of the local district budget \nexpenditures.  DHS2  will  provide  funds  to  districts  and  provinces  to  support  development \nspending to achieve increased health outcomes. With the DHS2, total district health expenditure \nwill comprise an average of about 2% of local expenditures during the project period. This is \nconsidered to have minimal impact on local budgetary resources.  In order to make substantial \nimpact on key health indicators, however, substantial increase in health spending would be \nrequired. To avoid a sharp drop in spending by 2011, public health spending would have to \nincrease during project implementation in order to sustain and deepen project benefits. Local \ngovernment commitment will have to be obtained to ensure sustainability of the health reforms \nand to maintain the improved public health facilities.  Increased levels of health spending at the \ndistrict level could be achieved through cross-subsidies between better-off and poor areas, and \nother  resource  mobilization  mechanisms  (community  mobilization  and  public-private-\npartnerships). \n \n \n                                                 \n5   World Bank. 2003.
