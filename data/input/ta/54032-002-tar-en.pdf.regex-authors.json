THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  Turkmenistan has experienced fast development over the last few decades, achieving \nupper-middle income status as of 2012.1 However, the country is facing an economic slowdown \nas result of low oil prices and decline in trade with significant impact on poverty and social \ndevelopment.2 This is aggravated by the recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic \ncausing further economic hardships.3 The Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates that gross \ndomestic product (GDP) growth will fall to 2.3% in 2020 compared to 6.3% in 2019.4 Turkmenistan \nhas committed to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including achieving good health \nand well-being for all, but faces serious capacity and institutional challenges in its health system. \n \n2.  In 2019, ADB conducted a health sector assessment in Turkmenistan and found the most \npressing challenge is the low quality of health services.  Access to high quality health care is \nlimited, even though the government has made significant investments in health infrastructure. \nFacilities in rural regions are poorly equipped and understaffed, and the country relies heavily on \nsecondary and tertiary care. In response to these health concerns and an increasing burden of \nnon-communicable diseases  the government has initiated the State Health Program (SHP), a \nmulti-sectoral plan that aims to improve the health of the population through provision of high \nquality and affordable services, sustainability of health financing, and reform of the health system \nbased  on  the  latest  medical  science.      The  central  pillars  for  the  SHP  are  upgrading  of \ninfrastructure, prevention and control of communicable diseases, awareness raising for disease \nprevention, expanding health insurance, and upgrading human resources for health (HRH).  \n \n3.  Insufficient HRH poses a critical bottleneck in the implementation of the SHP. Shortages \nof qualified staff make it difficult to implement government plans and respond to the increasing \ndemand for higher quality health services. Although international standards and protocols have \nbeen adopted, health workers lack understanding of basic medical principles and have little \nexposure  to  in-service  training  and  latest  evidence-based  practices  and  literature.    The \ngovernment has attempted to improve HRH in the last decade, but most reforms have focused \nonly on physicians, such as upgrading the State Medical University in 2010 and establishment of \npost-graduate  professional  development  faculty  for  physicians.  Nurses  have  received  less \ninvestment, despite being the first point of contact in primary health care (PHC), and primarily \nresponsible  for  patient  monitoring,  coordination  of  care,  patient  discharge,  and  infection \nprevention control in health facilities. There is abundant literature linking higher nurse staffing \nlevels to lower risks of mortality, shorter hospital stays and fewer occurrences of other adverse \npatient events,  but the country has not prioritized upgrading  the quantity and quality of nurses \nand other paramedical staff. While the country has not reported any cases of COVID-19 at the \ntime of writing, nurses are expected to play a critical role in patient triage, case detection, and \npatient management in intensive care units should cases appear in the country.  \n \n4.  In 2019, the government approved the National Action Plan (NAP) for the Development of \nHuman Resources for the Health in Turkmenistan prepared by the Ministry of Health and Medical \nIndustry (MOHMI). The NAP covers the five strategic areas of HRH planning and deployment, \neducation and training, personnel management and working conditions, monitoring, and research. \nThe  NAP  complements  the  SHP  and  its  emphasis  on  the  importance  of  developing  a \ncomprehensive nursing workforce to strengthen maternal and child health services and primary \n \n1  World Bank.

The NAP also supports the SHP\u2019s objectives of increasing nurse staffing levels \nand bolstering the role of family nurses by expanding their job descriptions and upgrading their \ntraining. In response to the lack of nurses and the need to support the implementation of the NAP \nand SHP, the MOHMI seeks ADB\u2019s support to upgrade the Ashgabat Medical School, and \nstrengthen HRH, management, and monitoring and research. \n \n5.  The project is expected to be financed with a $75 million loan from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources.  Co-financing  and  private  sector  opportunities  will  be  explored  during  project \npreparation.  \n \n6.  The proposed project will be aligned with the following impact: to provide effective health \ncare focused on the needs of the population and ensuring equitable access to health services, \nwhich is aligned with the National Action Plan for the Development of Human Resources for \nHealth in Turkmenistan for 2019\u20132025. The project will have three outputs: (i) modern nursing \neducation institution established; (ii) quality of nursing education and training improved; and (iii) \nmanagement of human resources for health strengthened. The outcome of the project is to \nimprove the quality and supply of the nurses. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n7.  The transaction technical assistance (TRTA) will help the government prepare the project. \nThe TRTA is justified given the specialized nature of skills required in areas such as modernizing \nthe Ashgabat Medical School, review of the medical education curricula and nursing program, \nand development of reforms to sector governance and management.5 This would be ADB\u2019s first \nproject in the health sector in Turkmenistan, and the TRTA will help the government to (i) review \nthe technical, economic and financial viability of the project and ascertain the project rationale, \nscope, cost, schedule, implementation arrangements, risks and mitigation measures; (ii) ensure \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s safeguard policy statement (2009) and identify mitigation measures and \ninstitutional strengthening; (iii) assist the project executing agency and implementing agency \nundertake advance actions for the ensuing project; and (iv) develop a strategy for engagement \nwith ADB in the health sector reform.  \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: Project design developed and partnership strategy prepared. This output \nwill develop the technical design parameters including (i) the preparation of technical assessment \nof nursing and/or medical education system and program, assessment of quality, supply and skills \ntraining of nurses, identify public-private partnership programs; and review of medical education \ncurricula; (ii) preparation of detailed project costings for the three outputs, including civil works, \nconsulting  services,  goods,  equipment,  capacity  building,  and  project  implementation;  (iii) \nidentification of capacity-building and professional development requirements (for faculty and \nstudents) including licensing and registration; (iv) preparation of the design and monitoring \nframework, including specification of performance indicators and project activities; (v) preparation \nof initial architectural designs for Ashgabat Medical School to be upgraded to a modern medical \ncollege; and (vi) development of strategic document for ADB\u2019s engagement in the health sector \nreform.  \n \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 November 2020.  \n \n ", "3 \n \n9.  Output 2: Due diligence undertaken. This output will support the project\u2019s due diligence, \nincluding the (i) environmental and social safeguards assessment; (ii) economic and financial \nanalyses; (iii) gender, poverty, and social analyses; (iv) procurement capacity and financial \nmanagement assessments of the executing agencies; (v) procurement risk assessment and \nstrategic procurement planning; (vi) risk assessment and management plan. The output will \nundertake  a  detailed  assessment  and  screening  to  confirm  the  level  of  risks,  identify  the \ninstitutional capacity requirements and prepare an action plan as measures to identify the \nconstraints and deficiencies. \n \n10.  Output 3: Project processing and start-up facilitated. This output will include assisting \nin the preparation of (i) project and all linked documents; (ii) list and specification of equipment; \n(iii) terms of reference of all project implementation consultants, project implementation unit (PIU) \nsupport staff, and other individual consultants; (iii) project start-up and implementation support, \nincluding assisting the executing agency in the establishment of PIU office, recruitment of PIU \nstaff, draft bid documents and request for proposals. The output will help the project achieve \nreadiness through completion of advance actions to ensure smooth project implementation.  \n \n11.  Output 4: Support for the establishment of personnel management information \nsystem. This output will support the review of existing systems and processes for managing \nhuman resources for health, and development of the initial design for the human resources for \nhealth registry. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TRTA is estimated to cost $0.75 million, of which $0.70 million will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Others). The key expenditure \nitems are listed in Appendix 1. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of \nexemptions on taxes and duties, counterpart staff, office accommodations and other in-kind \ncontributions. The government was informed that approval of the TRTA does not commit ADB to \nfinance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB will administer the TRTA. The Ministry of Health and Medical Industry (MOHMI) will \nbe the executing agency. The Social Sector Division of the Central and West Asia Department \nwill advertise, select, supervise and evaluate the consultants and will coordinate the project \npreparation with the MOHMI and other development partners. The TRTA will be implemented \nfrom December 2020 to December 2023 to ensure effective project preparation and start-up. The \nimplementation arrangements are summarized in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  December 2020\u2013December 2023 \nExecuting agency  Ministry of Health and Medical Industry \nImplementing agency  The Social Sector Division of the Central and West Asia Department \nwill coordinate project preparation with MOHMI and development \npartners. \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \n  Firm: Quality and cost- 43 person-monthsa \nbased selection    \n ", "4 \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndividual: Framework  25 person-months international and 18 \nagreement and  person-months national consultants \ntechnical \nconsultants/resource \npersons \nProcurement  To be procured by consultants \nRequest for quotations  Office equipment, furniture; 1\u20133 small\ncontracts approximately $2,500  \nDisbursement  Disbursement of TA resources will follow ADB's Technical Assistance\nDisbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from time to time). \nAsset turnover or disposal  Equipment, information and communication technology-related \narrangement upon TA completion  accessories, and any furniture purchased will be turned over to the \nexecuting agency upon completion of the technical assistance.  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, MOHMI = Ministry of Health and Medical Industry, TA= technical assistance. \na Terms of reference for consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n14.
