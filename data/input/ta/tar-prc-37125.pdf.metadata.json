During the 2003 Country Programming Mission of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested ADB to provide technical \nassistance (TA) to study the poverty reduction impact of area-wide road networks to improve the \nplanning,  implementation,  and  operations  of  road  networks.  The  TA  will  lead  to  a  more  \nequitable distribution of road investment benefits by linking local roads and the National Trunk \nHighway System (NTHS). The Fact-Finding Mission visited Beijing in July 2003 and reached an \nunderstanding with the Government on the TA objectives, scope, implementation arrangement, \ncost  estimates,  financing  plan,  and  terms  of  reference  for  consulting  services.  The  TA  is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s 2003 country assistance plan for the PRC.1 This report is based on the \nMission\u2019s findings. The TA framework is presented in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The PRC economy grew rapidly during the past decade, averaging around 10% per \nannum, and is expected to continue growing rapidly in the foreseeable future. Despite this good \nprogress, the Government\u2019s fight against poverty is far from over. Average gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) per capita is about $1,000. Living standards of millions of people in rural and \nurban areas, particularly in the western region, must be raised. \n \n3.  Economic growth has resulted in increasing traffic volume. The motor vehicle fleet is \ngrowing at 15\u201330% per annum, creating a huge demand for more road space. In 2002 the \nvehicle fleet totaled over 16 million trucks, cars, and buses; and 47 million other motorized \nvehicles. The privately owned fleet of motor vehicles increased more than 30 times in 1985\u2013\n2002, from 300,000 vehicles to 10 million. In 1990\u20132000 road traffic grew at 9.7% per annum for \npassenger traffic, and 5.9% per annum for freight.  Road traffic accounted for over 55% of the \ntotal passenger traffic. Given the PRC's rapid economic growth, low vehicle ownership rates, \nincreased automobile manufacturing capacity, lower car prices as tariff barriers fell after World \nTrade Organization accession, and increasing access to loans to finance automobile purchases, \nthe vehicle fleet is expected to continue to grow rapidly in the coming years. \n \n4.  Rural PRC needs a good road network to grow and prosper. The poor have limited \nmobility beyond their immediate communities because of geographic isolation and the high cost \nof motorized transport. As a result, the poor view roads as the key infrastructure needed to \naccelerate socioeconomic development, improve quality of life, create jobs, bring in stable \nincome, and provide access to social services. \n \n5.  The economy\u2019s changing structure and increasing diversification have altered transport \ndemand.  Demand  for  road  transport  has  risen  faster  than  that  for  other  transport  modes.  \nTo meet the growing demand for improved access to markets and services, the Government \nhas made major efforts to increase road capacity. Roads are classified into expressways, and \nlocal (classes I\u2013IV) and unclassified roads. The backbone of the network is the NTHS, a 35,000-\nkilometer (km) system of interprovincial expressways and high-class highways to be constructed \nby 2010. Village and farm roads, which are normally either class IV or unclassified, are the \nlowest level of the network. In 2000 the Government adopted the Western Region Development \nStrategy to enhance economic development where most of the poor reside, and gives high \npriority to the road sector to promote economic growth and reduce poverty. \n \n6.  To remove major transport bottlenecks, the Government implemented a large investment \nprogram of the road sector, totaling CNY924 billion during 1996\u20132000, compared with CNY242 \nbillion during 1991\u20131995. The road network grew from 1.16 million km in 1995 to 1.76 million km \nin 2002, and expressways increased from 2,141 km to 25,200 km. The second stage of the road \ndevelopment program (2003\u20132020) will increase the network to over 3 million km, or 68,000 km \nannually.  Expressways  will  increase  to  70,000  km,  or  2,650  km  annually.  In  2003  the \n                                                 \n1  The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 25 April 2003. ", "2 \nGovernment  launched  5,300  rural  road  projects,  covering  78,000  km  and  costing  CNY78 \nbillion.2 \n \n7.  Despite the huge amount of investment, the PRC\u2019s road transport network has many \nweaknesses, which are particularly evident in the poor rural western areas. Roads and traffic \nmanagement fall under the responsibility of various agencies.3 Information is not coordinated or \nexchanged. Expressways and class-I highways account for 3% of the total road network, and \nclass-2 highways for 11%. About 70% of the county and township roads are gravel or earth \nroads; 340 townships and 67,000 villages have no road connection. Public transport services \n(buses) are unavailable in 1,000 townships and 160,000 villages, most of which are in the \nwestern region (footnote 2). Expressways are built on the outskirts of key urban areas but \nconnections to the city center are insufficient. Roads without adequate traffic signals, signs, or \nmarkings constitute about 86% of the total network. Domestic market development has been \nhindered by the lack of transport integration and high logistics costs. For example, transporting \ngrapes from Sichuan Province to Beijing costs more than importing them from Chile.4 \n \n8.  Rapid traffic growth has increased road network congestion and the number of road \naccidents.  In  2002  773,137  road  accidents  caused  109,381  fatalities,  or  1  fatality  every  \n5 minutes\u2014the highest rate in the world. Without appropriate measures, fatalities could reach \n200,000 per annum by 2010. Economic losses from accidents are 1\u20133% of GDP per annum. \nA disproportionate number of fatalities are the poor, usually pedestrians, nonmotorized transport \nusers, and public bus users. \n \n9.  The road sector is the largest sector in ADB\u2019s PRC operations, accounting for about \n60%  of  the  portfolio.  Roads  also  dominate  ADB\u2019s  future  PRC  program. \nTo increase the probability that the poor will benefit from ADB-funded road projects, these have \nbeen shifted to the poor central and southwest regions. \n \n10.  The scope of ADB-financed road projects has been broadened to include improving local \nroads, thus providing better access to poor communities, as well as financing expressways. \nADB\u2019s operational approach revolves around two concerns: (i) developing the NTHS to connect \nthe key economic growth centers, and (ii) improving local roads to increase the likelihood that \nthe poor will benefit from the investment. Adopting an area-wide approach to road network \nplanning\u2014one that links NTHS and local roads\u2014can significantly help eliminate poverty and \noptimize transport system efficiency.5 \n \n11.  Obstacles that hinder deepening Government and ADB-financed road projects\u2019 poverty \nimpacts and impede understanding the linkage of better roads to poverty reduction include the \nfollowing: \n \n(i)  The  Government\u2019s  planning  approach  and  feasibility  study  methodology  are \nbased  on  a  single-project  approach.  Insufficient  attention  is  paid  to  linking \nexpressways with local roads to meet the needs of the poor.  \n(ii)  Different agencies are responsible for expressways and local roads, creating \nproblems in planning and coordination.  \n(iii)  Scarce resources are being diverted from local roads to expressways.  \n(iv)  Fiscal resources are lacking for local roads, which, unlike expressways, are not \ntolled.  \n(v)  Transport planning is lacking through which expressways and local roads can be \nintegrated with community transport systems.  \n                                                 \n2  Ministry of Communications (MOC). 2003.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n12.  The TA aims to improve planning of road network investments and operations in the \nPRC, which will benefit the poor and increase overall economic benefits from road network \ninvestments through better linkage between local roads and NTHS. In view of the tremendous \ngrowth expected (para. 6) and current obstacles (para. 11), the TA will help the Government \nprepare a road network strategy that promotes, in an integrated manner, expressways and local \nroads to meet communities\u2019 needs and support economic growth. The TA will provide road \nagencies with the cross-disciplinary skills and tools to incorporate poverty- and stakeholder-\nrelated issues6 in various stages of road project planning, implementation, and operation. \n \n13.  The TA will help do the following: \n \n(i)  Develop an integrated and sustainable road network development strategy to \nbetter link poor communities. It is expected to help the Government move away \nfrom the single-project approach, and prepare priorities for the Eleventh Five-\nYear Plan (11FYP, 2006\u20132010), and the 2020 program.  \n(ii)  Recommend a central government mechanism to fund local road investments, \nand enhance local financing capacity, to tackle institutional obstacles.  \n(iii)  Improve  the  Government\u2019s  feasibility  study  methodology7  and  guidelines  to \nfacilitate road network project planning and selection.  \n(iv)  Develop  a  computerized  information  system  (IS)  to  provide  uniform  social, \neconomic, engineering, transport, and area-specific data to fill the current gap; \nand  an  integrated  area-wide  road  network  model  (ARNM)  to  evaluate  road \nnetwork investments, using IS data.  \n(v)  Conduct a pilot project to test the strategy, feasibility study methodology, IS, and \nARNM.  \n(vi)  Create a transport planning unit (TPU) 8 to improve road investment programs \nand  strengthen  interagency  cooperation  and  coordination,  improve  human \nresources development, oversee implementation of the pilot project, and conduct \nmonitoring. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA will address sector strategy, project support, and monitoring. The sector strategy \nstudy will do the following: \n \n(i)  Build on the strength of the ADB-PRC partnership in the road sector; review \nrelevant studies, including ADB-financed TAs;9 and assess supply and demand, \n                                                 \n6  Zaman, M. 2002.

The project support study will improve the feasibility study methodology and guidelines \nto facilitate planning and selection of road network projects, to allow the poor to benefit from \nimproved  roads  and  fulfill  the  requirements  of  the  new  government  program  (para.  6).  \nThe guidelines will include (i) procedures to define and implement expressway projects based \non consideration of the overall road network services rather than just the traditional individual \nNTHS link; and (ii) procedures to define local roads based on (a) required local road standards; \n(b) means of transport; (c) integration with NTHS and local infrastructure; and (d) community-\nrelated factors such as community participation, location of local roads, social services, and \nproductive sectors (e.g., agriculture). The improved feasibility study (footnote 7) is anticipated to \ncontribute significantly to planning of community-oriented projects and to intensify their impact \non poverty. \n \n16.  The project support study will develop practitioner tools to facilitate strategic planning, \npreparation  of  feasibility  studies,  and  management  of  roads.  The  study  will  (i)  develop  a \ncomputerized IS that will provide uniform social, economic, engineering, transport, and area-\nspecific data; (ii) develop an integrated ARNM to evaluate road network investments, using IS \ndata; and (iii) conduct a pilot project to test the strategy, feasibility study methodology, IS, and \nARNM. The study\u2019s output will fill information and analysis gaps and provide road planners, \ndesigners, and decision makers with the skills and ability to deliver better transport services. \n \n17.  The monitoring study will (i) develop a monitoring system; and (ii) create a TPU to \nimprove  road  investment  programs,  strengthen  interagency  cooperation  and  coordination, \nimprove  human  resources  development,  oversee  implementation  of  the  pilot  project,  and \nconduct monitoring. \n \n18.  The relevant central government strategy, systems, and plan will be investigated, and \nthree  western  areas10  selected  for  field  study  to  develop  proposals:  Sichuan  Province, \nChongqing Municipality, and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, which include nine existing \nand planned ADB-financed road projects, representing an ideal case study to gather reliable \ninput  for  the  TA  and  implement  the  pilot  project.  The  proposed  Central  Sichuan  Roads \nDevelopment, Guangxi Roads Development II and Chongqing Roads Development projects will \nbe included in the TA study together with the exiting projects of the study areas.  \n \n19.  The final report will consolidate the findings of the TA studies and be complemented by \nguidelines, user manuals, and relevant documents. The TA will finance a national conference to \ndisseminate the knowledge gained under the TA and to provide guidance on priority issues. \nSenior government officials, ADB staff, stakeholders, and development partners will be invited. \nWorkshops will assess issues and outcome. Staff of the TPU and selected agencies will be \ntrained to fill gaps in their knowledge, facilitate planning and operations of future integrated road \nnetwork investments, run the pilot project, and enable staff to update the final TA outcome \nregularly and provide expert advice. An audiovisual package and promotional materials will be \nprepared to disseminate the knowledge developed under the TA. \n \n \n                                                 \n10 The areas include high poverty incidence and cultural minorities; heavy interprovincial traffic; regional trade  \n(e.g., Viet Nam); planned and ongoing projects; operational expressway and local road projects; and intermodal \ntransport (road, port, and rail). ", "    5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n20.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.4 million equivalent, comprising $631,700 of \nforeign  exchange  cost  and  $768,300  equivalent  of  local  currency  cost.  ADB  will  provide  \n$1 million equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and a portion of the local \ncurrency cost amounting to $368,300 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from \nthe Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund and administered by ADB. Government will finance \nthe remaining $400,000 equivalent to cover the costs of office accommodation and support \nservices,  communications,  local  transport,  office  supply,  and  other  facilities  and  services \nrequired to implement the TA. The detailed cost estimate is in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  A team of international consulting firms in association with domestic consulting firms will \nbe engaged using the simplified technical proposal procedures based on the quality- and cost-\nbased selection method and in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \nThe  TA  will  require  a  total  of  46  person-months  of  consulting  services  (15  international,  \n31  domestic)  to  carry  out  the  study  as  defined  in  the  outline  terms  of  reference.  \nThe international and domestic consultants will provide expertise in (i) highway and traffic \nengineering;  (ii)  transport  planning  and  economics;  (iii)  transport  policy  and  organization,  \n(iv)  poverty  and  social  analysis;  and  (v)  management  information  system.  The  terms  of \nreference are in Appendix 3. \n \n22.  MOC will be the TA executing agency, responsible for supervision and monitoring of TA \nactivities,  and  providing  ADB  and  consultants  with  what  they  need.  A  central  steering \ncommittee, chaired by the director general of the Comprehensive Planning Department, MOC, \nhas been established, comprising the National Development and Reform Commission and \nMinistry of  Finance. Project committees, chaired by directors of provincial communications \ndepartments, and including interagency staff, have been established in the relevant provinces. \nThe consultants will be fielded in May 2004 and work for 12 months. MOC will provide the \nconsultants  with  the  required  office  accommodation  and  services  in  Beijing  and  relevant \nprovinces.  All  equipment,  systems,  and  guidelines  will  be  procured  under  the  consultants\u2019 \ncontract in accordance with arrangements acceptable to ADB, and ownership will be transferred \nto  the  TPU  after  the  TA.  Tripartite  meetings  involving  the  Government,  ADB  staff,  and \nconsultants will be held in the PRC to advise and guide the consultants and review their reports. \nThe final report will be submitted 6 weeks after ADB and Government comments. After the TA \nstarts, MOC will establish the TPU as part of Sichuan Province Communications Department, \nwhich  has  a  good  implementation  reputation  and  large  number  of  projects.  The  TPU  will \nmanage the pilot project, which will also start during the TA, and provide an annual monitoring \nreport to ADB for 3 years after TA completion. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,000,000  to  the \nGovernment of the People\u2019s Republic of China to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty \nReduction Cooperation Fund for Poverty Impact of Area-Wide Road Networks, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.
