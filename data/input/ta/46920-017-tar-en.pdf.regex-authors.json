Since its launch in 2012, ADB\u2019s Supply Chain Finance Program (SCFP) has supported \n1,059 transactions valued at $722 million. Of the 1,059 transactions, 864 transactions involve \nSMEs. SCFP has also generated $361 million in co-financing as of 31 October 2018. The SCFP \ncontinues to expand in view of the additional financing and broader scope approved in 2018.1 As \nthe strategic direction of SCFP was widened from large global banks to include banks in DMCs, \npipeline development is ongoing with DMC-based partner financial institutions (PFIs), with initial \ncandidates  to  be  identified  through  ADB\u2019s  Trade  Finance  Program  (TFP)  partner  bank \nrelationships. Going forward, SCFP is also assessing the extension of debt financing directly to \ncorporate and SME obligors without the involvement of a PFI and working with third-party SCF \nplatforms. These are expected to further widen SCFP\u2019s reach both geographically, to focus on \nmore challenging markets, and with SMEs. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUBPROJECT \nA.  Overall Progress of the Technical Assistance Cluster \n2.  This is the first subproject under the Capacity Development for the Supply Chain Finance \nProgram (Phase 2). \n \nB.  Subproject Scope  \n3.  Subproject 1 will provide the SCFP with funding to conduct due diligence and monitoring \nassessments on DMC companies, DMC banks and PFIs, administer transactions and manage \noverall counterparty relationships. Subproject 1 will also include capacity building through in- \nhouse capacity development as well as seminars and trainings.  \n \nC.  Subproject Outputs and Activities  \n4.  Output 1: SCF availability expanded in DMCs. Under subproject 1, ADB will engage \nconsultants who will assist in the implementation of the SCFP by conducting in-depth due \ndiligence and risk analysis on DMC companies in which ADB would assume risk under the \nprogram, administering transactions, performing monitoring assessments on DMC companies, \nDMC banks and PFIs, and ensuring that two additional supply chain finance agreements with \nPFIs are executed by Q4 2018.  \n \n5.  Output  2:    SCF  knowledge  deepened  in  DMCs  through  in-house  capacity \ndevelopment as well as seminars and trainings. Subproject 1 will fund related knowledge-\nsharing and partnership activities including in-house capacity development training, seminars and \nregional trainings for DMC banks, SMEs and regulators to increase supply chain finance usage \nand broaden SME access to supply chain financing. The consultants will also help design and \nimplement a supply chain finance study in collaboration with the ADB Institute, ADB\u2019s Sustainable \nDevelopment and Climate Change Department, and the International Chamber of Commerce to \nestablish industry benchmarks. These activities will contribute to the development of supply chain \nfinance in countries where it is still at a nascent stage of development. \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2018.

Subproject 1 activities will include the following: \n \n(i)  work with DMC companies (i.e. corporate and SME obligors) and PFIs to acquire \nfinancial data; \n(ii)  conduct in-depth due diligence and risk analysis that will focus on credit and \nperformance risk and established relationships specific to a supply chain of DMC \ncompanies in which ADB would assume risk under the program, and ensure that \nbusiness  activities  of  such  DMC  companies  are  not  on  ADB\u2019s  prohibited \ninvestment activities list; \n(iii)  assess  the  SCF  operations  capacity  of  selected  banks  and  make \nrecommendations for improvement; \n(iv)  draft credit applications, risk ratings, and financial due diligence reports; \n(v)  conduct integrity due diligence and reputational risk reviews, including monitoring \nand following up on recommendations for improvement;  \n(vi)  conduct signing ceremonies with new PFIs;  \n(vii)  conduct  knowledge-building,  knowledge-sharing,  and  partnership-development \nactivities (including training seminars for DMC banks, SMEs and regional training \nand/or networking events);  \n(viii)  administer transactions and perform annual monitoring assessments on DMC \ncompanies and PFIs; and \n(ix)  engage consultants or possibly work with established financial technology or SCF \nplatforms to facilitate operations. \n \nD.
