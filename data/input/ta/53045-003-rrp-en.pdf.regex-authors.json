THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Kingdom of Tonga for the Nuku\u2019alofa Port Upgrade Project. \n \n2.  The project will upgrade cargo wharves located in the Queen Salote International Wharf \n(QSIW) of Nuku\u2019alofa Port. It will rehabilitate, renew, and expand the infrastructure; strengthen \nmanagement and operations; and improve the port's capacity. The project is aligned with the \nimpact of safer, more reliable, and more affordable transport infrastructure and services in Tonga. \nThe project will also benefit other Pacific countries in the region with connecting shipping routes \nwith the Nuku\u2019alofa Port, such as the Cook Islands, Samoa. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Tonga is an archipelago of more than 170 islands scattered across 700,000 square \nkilometers of the southern Pacific Ocean. About 70% of the nation\u2019s 108,000 inhabitants live on \nthe main island of Tongatapu, which is also home to the country\u2019s capital, Nuku\u2019alofa. The rest of \nthe population is spread across 36 surrounding islands. Being a small island nation, Tonga must \nimport most of the goods needed, and more than 98% of imports arrive by sea. Nuku\u2019alofa Port \nis the country\u2019s main international port and its lifeline, given its geographical isolation from \ninternational markets. \n \n4.  Deteriorating and insufficient port infrastructure. The cargo terminal of Nuku\u2019alofa \nPort is the QSIW with two international container wharves.1 The QSIW is deteriorating because \nof lack of maintenance and investment. A structural assessment undertaken in March 2019 found \nthat wharf no. 1 was in a very advanced state of deterioration requiring immediate upgrade. \nOperations at the wharf were suspended in April 2019 because of safety concerns, and remain \nsuspended to date. The other wharves are in serviceable condition and their structural integrity \nremains sound. However, related facilities such as the container yard and the port\u2019s access road \nare also deteriorating and pose safety risks. Rehabilitation is required within 5 years to extend the \nservice life of the infrastructure and avoid the higher costs of renewal. \n \n5.  The Ministry of Infrastructure (MOI) is responsible for overall infrastructure planning and \nimplementation, while Ports Authority Tonga (PAT), a government-owned enterprise reporting \nthrough the Ministry of Public Enterprises, is responsible for the operation and maintenance \n(O&M) of Nuku\u2019alofa Port. While PAT has successfully operated the port since its creation in 1999, \nit has insufficient technical capacity to undertake maintenance works and insufficient funds to \ncover maintenance costs. \n \n6.  Tonga is highly reliant on imports, so the cost of importing goods has a significant impact \non its economy and can undermine economic development. The water depth at the port is \n11 meters (m), enough to accommodate container vessels up to 220 m long. However, the length \nof wharf no. 2 is only 110 m, which limits the vessel size to 180 m and prevents the deployment \nof larger vessels to lower transport costs. The short wharf and the lack of mooring points also \npose the risk of mooring line failure and excessive vessel motions during the loading and \nunloading of container ships. In addition, cargo volumes (containers) have increased from an \n \n1  The QSIW has four wharves, two of which were previously used for domestic trade and transport. The international \ncargo wharves are wharf no. 1 built in 1967 and upgraded in 1997, and wharf no. 2 built in 1986. \n ", "2 \naverage of 12,071 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) per year between 2004 and 2010 to an \naverage of 25,205 TEU per year between 2016 and 2018.2 Port demand forecasts reflect a global \neconomic slowdown and trade disruptions due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. \n \n7.  Port safety and operational challenges. The QSIW is compliant with the International \nShip and Port Security Code (ISPS Code). 3 In addition, it is assessed yearly by the International \nPort Security liaison officers from the United States Coast Guard (USCG). However, the latest \nUSCG assessment found problems to be addressed in the QSIW, although did not affect the \ncompliance with the ISPS Code. These problems concern access control and the marking of \nrestricted areas, and other safety and security risks.4 Following a fatal accident at the QSIW in \n2018, a safety assessment conducted by the Pacific Community (SPC) revealed serious health \nand  safety hazards,  such  as the  poor  condition  of  the  container  yard;  unsafe  handling  of \ncontainers; poor lighting; and lack of fire hydrants, life buoys, and sufficient first aid kits.5 \n \n8.  Tonga is a member state of the International Maritime Organization and has ratified the \nInternational Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, which obliges it to comply with \nthe technical, environmental, and safety standards set forth in the convention. However, the \ncurrent  operating  practices  and  conditions at  the  QSIW  are  poor  and  also  harmful to the \nenvironment, such as uncontrolled dumping of rubbish and waste, with spillovers onto the \nforeshore; unbounded fuel storage areas; and pooling of water and other liquids. Moreover, \nenergy-efficient practices have not been fully integrated into port operations. In June 2018, as \npart of its Green Pacific Port initiative, the SPC undertook an energy audit that identified measures \nto cut energy consumption and emissions, such as control of vehicle movements or replacement \nof lighting.6 PAT only implemented some of the measures because of lack of capacity and funding. \n \n9.  Minimal use of technology and infrequent updates to tariff regime. An assessment \nsupported by Asian Development Bank (ADB) technical assistance found that the level of \ndigitalization in the port is minimal.7 Port processes are mainly paper-based, security personnel \ndo not employ proper systems to ensure controlled access and port security (such as cameras \nand remote gate control), and PAT does not have real-time data on wave conditions to inform \nvessel movements. In addition, port tariffs have not been revised or reviewed since 2014, \nalthough  tariff  adjustments  are  needed  to  optimize  revenue  and  ensure  alignment  with \nneighboring countries. These issues affect productivity and could have a future impact in the \ncompliance with the ISPS Code. \n \n10.  Port vulnerability to climate change and disasters. The port is in a region vulnerable \nto climate change impacts and disasters. Tonga as a whole is in a seismically active area, with \nlarge earthquakes regularly occurring every 10\u201320 years and resulting in significant damage. The \nport also suffers from the impacts of cyclones hitting Tonga regularly with strong waves, winds, \nrainfall, and floods. Tsunamis with waves of up to 1 m strike every 50\u2013100 years. Climate change \nis worsening the effects of cyclones, and the rising sea level creates additional risks. Climate \nchange impacts in the port are high, and it is therefore essential to enhance the resilience of the \n \n2  TEU (commonly used in the singular) is a standard unit of measurement in maritime transport, equal to a container \n20 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 8 feet tall. A 40-foot container is equivalent to two TEU. \n3  The ISPS Code is an essential international maritime regulation for the safety and security of ships, ports, cargo, and \ncrews. It is an amendment to the Safety of Life at Sea Convention (1974/1988) that came into force in 2004. The \nUSCG is one of the lead agencies implementing the ISPS Code and monitoring compliance with it. \n4  USCG. 2018. Nuku\u2019alofa Port Safety Review. Nuku\u2019alofa. \n5  The Pacific Community, founded in 1947 as the South Pacific Commission (hence the abbreviation SPC) but \nrenamed in 1997, is an international organization for the sustainable development of the Pacific. \n6  The Green Pacific Port initiative aims to make port operations more sustainable at all the Pacific ports. \n7  ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance for Trade and Facilitation in the Pacific. Manila. \n ", "3 \nport. Disaster management processes need to be put in place to minimize disruptions and resume \nservices promptly after a disaster. \n \n11.  Limited role of women. Tonga ranks 100th (out of 187) in the Gender Inequality Index of \nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).8 According to the Government of Tonga, \n40.5%  of  women  are  employed  in  relatively  low-paid  craft  and  related  trades;  16%  are \nprofessionals, 16% are service and sales workers, and 10.7% are clerical support workers. 9 All \nfive PAT board members are men and, of the eight individuals on the management team, only \none is a woman (the manager of corporate services) (12.5%). The low representation of women \nin the highest levels of decision-making reflects a strong gender bias in Tonga, which sees men \nas the key decision makers in society. Women represent 14% (22) of PAT staff overall, and are \nemployed largely in support roles in corporate services and QSIW operations (PAT Annual \nReport, 2019). In addition, PAT does not have a gender policy to achieve gender equality at the \nworkplace and in the organization. \n \n12.  Communicable diseases. Tonga is highly vulnerable to communicable diseases and \ntheir impacts because it relies heavily on imported goods and international tourism, and the \ncapacity of the health system is weak. The 2019 measles outbreak in the Pacific region was \nfollowed by COVID-19. While Tonga has no reported COVID-19 cases to date, the pandemic-\ninduced  global  border  closures  are  significantly  disrupting  the  country\u2019s  service  industry, \nespecially tourism, which is a major source of income. Ensuring that Nuku\u2019alofa Port remains \noperational while shielding the country from communicable diseases is vital. Tonga needs to \nstrengthen its procedures with a plan to mitigate the transmission risk of communicable diseases. \n \n13.  Alignment with strategic priorities. Tonga\u2019s development goals include safer, more \nreliable, and more affordable transport infrastructure and services, as defined in the Tonga \nStrategic Development Framework, 2015\u20132025.10 The National Infrastructure Investment Plan, \n2013\u20132023 prioritizes the improvement of maritime infrastructure to cope with increased demand \nand the impact of climate change and disasters.11 The project is aligned with the Pacific Approach, \n2016\u20132020 in reducing costs by improving regional connectivity through transport infrastructure, \nmanaging risks, and enabling value creation.12 The project is also associated with other regional \ninitiatives, such as the SPC\u2019s Green Pacific Port (para. 8). ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 expands the \nfocus on small island developing states to strengthen connectivity, access, and institutional \ncapacity, while tackling climate change impacts and disaster risks, fostering regional cooperation \nand integration and addressing poverty and reducing gender inequalities.13 The project is listed \nin ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for 11 Small Pacific Island Countries, 2020\u20132022.14 \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n14.  The project is aligned with the following impact: safer, more reliable, and more affordable \ntransport infrastructure and services provided in Tonga.15 The project will have the following \noutcome: capacity and operations of Nuku\u2019alofa Port improved.16 \n \n8  http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/gender-inequality-index (accessed 8 June 2020). \n9  Government of Tonga. 2018.

Output 1 includes (i) rehabilitating all cargo \nwharves and restoring the top surface (deck) of wharf no. 1, (ii) building a concrete seawall and \nstrengthening  the  rock  revetment,  (iii) reconstructing  and  reorganizing  the  container  yard; \n(iv) upgrading the port access road; and (v) repairing auxiliary port facilities. These interventions \nwill extend the life of the infrastructure, increase port capacity and safety, and lower O&M costs. \n \n16.  Output 2: International cargo wharves and supporting infrastructure extended. \nOutput 2 consists of (i) a 50 m extension of wharf no. 2; (ii) the construction of four mooring or \nberthing dolphins for the safer docking of vessels during loading and unloading; and (iii) the \nrelocation of a channel navigation marker. These interventions will allow the deployment of larger \nvessels, which will reduce shipping costs and ultimately the cost of importing and exporting goods. \nIt will also encourage regional trade to neighboring states with connecting shipping routes, such \nas the Cook Islands, Samoa, and the main trading partners (Australia, New Zealand, and the \nUnited States). \n \n17.  Output 3: Port operations and management improved. Output 3 consists of improving \nthe capacity of PAT to operate and manage the port. It covers (i) the formulation of a gender \nequality policy and related training\u2014such as raising awareness of sexual exploitation, abuse, and \nharassment at the workplace, and of sexually transmitted diseases\u2014as well as support for the \nrecruitment (and retention) of women into more responsible functions; (ii) implementation of an \nasset management plan (AMP) to ensure the financial sustainability of the port; (iii) a review of \nthe tariff regime and the development of reform options; (iv) business skills training for women to \ndevelop and manage their own microbusinesses; and (v) training programs on port operations, \nenvironmentally sustainable work practices, equipment handling, health and safety aspects, and \nport security, including a COVID-19 response plan for port operations. \n   \n18.  COVID-19. The project scope was broadened to include a COVID-19 response plan to \nmitigate the risk of virus transmission and ensure that the port remains operational during the \npandemic. The plan includes reviewing the port's operational procedures, creating an isolation \nfacility within the port boundaries, providing essential medical equipment, and implementing a \ntraining  program  for  employees  in  coordination  with  local  health  authorities.  Port  demand \nforecasts were revised in light of a global economic slowdown and trade disruptions. Despite the \nCOVID-19 situation, the project remains feasible and relevant because infrastructure needs still \nhave to be met and the investment will also aid the post-COVID-19 economic recovery. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n19.  ADB has extensive experience in helping meet the needs and reduce the challenges faced \nby Pacific developing member countries in maritime transport. It supported past and ongoing \nimprovements  to  maritime  infrastructure  and  services  in  Fiji,  Papua  New  Guinea,  Samoa, \nSolomon Islands, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. The proposed project will benefit from the lessons of this \nearlier assistance, such as the need to (i) allocate sufficient contingencies given the nature of civil \nworks in complex marine environments, (ii) ensure a high level of readiness, (iii) allow for third-\nparty reviews of the detailed engineering design, and (iv) schedule civil works wisely to avoid \ncyclone seasons. ADB also supported the preparation of an AMP, to be implemented as part of \noutput 3 (para. 17) and defined in the project administration manual (PAM), to ensure the \nsustainability of the investment for Tonga.17 The AMP, which includes various technical and \n \n17 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \nfinancial requirements to improve PAT\u2019s capacity to undertake maintenance, can be replicated \nacross different projects in Tonga and the wider Pacific region. \n \n20.  Green and smart ports promoting gender equality. The recent experience gained by \nADB in promoting green and smart ports in the port of Apia (Samoa) is a key value addition.18 The \nproject is designed with green and smart components that promote the port\u2019s environmental \nsustainability. These include new drainage systems and bounded container leaking areas to \ncontrol and eliminate spills into the sea, or new lighting towers with light emitting diode (LED) \nlamps and dimmable control. Supporting gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment, the project \nincludes gender aspects to promote the participation of women in port operations, which is critical \nto the equitable development of countries with low levels of women\u2019s participation. \n \n21.  Lessons from previous project. The most recent ADB transport project in Tonga prior \nto this one was the Transport Infrastructure Project, which upgraded wharf no. 1 in 1997, the \nsame wharf that will be rehabilitated under the project.19 The project closed in November 2000, \nand the completion report concluded that it had been implemented satisfactorily and that the \nderived benefits exceeded expectations.20 The key lessons are that (i) regular (semiannual) \nreview missions are imperative; (ii) construction supervision and project management should be \ncarried out by people full-time based in the country; (iii) local materials (aggregates) cannot be \nused in marine concrete structures, since wharf no. 1 was upgraded using local materials but \ndeteriorated prematurely; and (iv) monitoring and maintenance mechanisms need to be in place \nto prevent the premature degradation of the infrastructure. \n \n22.  Project  preparation  and  readiness.  ADB\u2019s  technical  assistance  for  Strengthening \nDomestic Transport Connectivity in the Pacific supported the preparation and due diligence of the \nproject.21 To ensure high project readiness, ADB in July 2019 also approved project readiness \nfinancing (PRF) to prepare the detailed designs and provide procurement support.22 The designs \nare due for completion within November 2020. Procurement (prequalification) started in July 2020. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n23.  The project is estimated to cost $50.0 million (Table 1). Detailed cost estimates by \nexpenditure category and by financier are included in the PAM (footnote 17). The civil works for \nthe port upgrade represent the major expenditure under the project. \n \nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.  Base Costb   \n  1.

The government will \nfinance taxes and duties, office space, and small expenditures for the operation of the PMU office. \n \nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank     \nSpecial Funds resources (Asian Development Fund grant)  15.0  30.0 \nSpecial Funds resources (Asian Development Fund grant \u2013 Concessional \nResources Regional Pool)  30.0  60.0 \nGovernment of Tonga  5.0  10.0 \nTotal  50.0  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n25.  Climate change mitigation is estimated to cost $6.1 million and climate change adaptation \nis estimated to cost $15.1 million. ADB will finance 100% of the mitigation and adaptation costs. \nMitigation activities include installing LED lighting in the port with dimmable control, building an \nelectrical substation and a fuel tank with a fuel monitoring system, and extending one wharf. \nAdaptation activities include raising the level of the container yard, building a seawall, and \ninstalling new drainage systems.23 The costs of disaster risk reduction measures to boost the \nport\u2019s disaster resilience total $4.8 million and include designing the structures to the latest \nearthquake codes and suitably elevating critical infrastructure (electrical substation). \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n26.  Project  management  arrangements.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  be  the \nexecuting agency and the Ministry of Infrastructure (MOI) will be the implementing agency for the \nproject. Both will be responsible for administering ADB financing, undertaking procurement, and \nimplementing the project. PAT as the current port operator will provide advisory support and \ntechnical inputs but will not administer funds, award or administer the contracts for consulting \nservices and works, or otherwise implement project activities. Following project completion, PAT \nwill  be  responsible  for  the  O&M  of  Nuku\u2019alofa  Port.  The  existing  Sector-Based  Steering \nCommittee will oversee project implementation and provide guidance on the alignment of project \noutcomes with the government\u2019s priorities and objectives. The government\u2019s Project, Aid and \nDevelopment Coordination Committee will guide coordination with other development partners. \nBoth committees are formed by Government agencies and ministries. The PMU was established \nunder the PRF (para. 22) and will continue throughout the project. \n \n27.  Consulting  recruitment  and  procurement.  The  procurement  of  goods,  works  and \nconsulting services will follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time), \nthe Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time), and \n \n23 Details are in Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nassociated staff instructions. Advance contracting will be used. The government requested ADB \nsupport in the recruitment of the construction supervision consultant. A delegation matrix outlining \nthe responsibilities of the government and ADB in selecting the consultant was agreed between \nthe two parties and set out in the PAM (footnote 17). ADB will support the recruitment process, \nincluding the tender and evaluation. The government will remain responsible for negotiating, \nsigning, and managing the consulting contract. \n \n28.  ADB used strategic procurement planning to choose the best possible procurement \narrangements. The project will achieve the best value for money by (i) using e-procurement \ntechnology to lower the transaction cost and enhance transparency; (ii) attracting well-qualified \ninternational contracting firms to deliver quality civil works using the prequalification process, \nfollowed by open competitive bidding with merit-point-based evaluation criteria; (iii) directly \ncontracting the construction supervision consulting firm (Royal HaskoningDHV) because of its \nsatisfactory performance in providing feasibility study and detailed design services\u2014this \u201cone \nproject\u2013one consultant\u201d strategy will ensure continuity and technical consistency. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  November 2020\u2013June 2026 \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2026 \nEstimated grant closing date  31 December 2026 \nManagement \n(i) Oversight bodies  Project, Aid, and Development Coordination Committee \nSector-Based Steering Committee \n(ii) Executing agency  Ministry of Finance \n(iii) Key implementing agency  Ministry of Infrastructure \n(iv) Implementation unit  Project management unit, 3 staff  \nProcurement  Open competitive bidding with  1 contract  $34.00 million \nprequalification (internationally \nadvertised) \nRequest for quotations (vehicle)  1 contract  $35,000 \nConsulting services  Direct contractinga (firm)  1 contract (60 PM)  $1.65 million \nDirect contracting (individual consultants)  3 contracts (90 PM)  $0.46 million \nAdvance contracting   Main civil works and consulting services packages \nDisbursement  The grant proceeds will be disbursed following ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements \nagreed between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PM = person-months. \na  The firm Royal HaskoningDHV will be contracted directly as construction supervision consultant because of its \nsatisfactory performance in providing feasibility study and detailed design services, which will ensure continuity and \ntechnical consistency. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n29.  The project feasibility study covered a full assessment of the operation and capacity of the \nport over the next 20 years up to 2040, covering demand analysis and forecast, benchmarking \nwith  other  ports  in  the  region,  condition  assessment  of  infrastructure  and  operations,  and \nvulnerability to climate change and disasters. The feasibility study also identified several options \nfor the upgrade of the port that were assessed and prioritized using a multicriteria analysis. The \ncriteria of the analysis were (i) safety of operation, (ii) infrastructure capacity, (iii) social and \nenvironmental impacts, (iv) O&M, (v) constructability, (vi) climate and disaster resilience, and  \n(vii) future proofing. The multicriteria analysis concluded with the proposed upgrade option. \n ", "8 \n \n30.  The selected option is the most cost-effective solution of the analyzed options and consists \nof extending wharf no. 2 and refurbishing wharf no. 1. Wharf no. 1 is to be used as a secondary \nwharf to minimize potential delays associated with several vessels arriving at once (10%\u201315% \noccurrence). This wharf is also key to maintaining the vital service provided by the port during \nconstruction works to extend wharf no. 2, which will be temporarily closed. The reorganization of \nthe  container  yard  ensures  optimal  efficiency  during  offloading  operations;  safer  road  and \npedestrian access; and new lighting, firefighting, and electrical substation facilities positioned at \nstrategic locations. The design of the port access road will ensure better access by removing the \nrisk of flooding under heavy rain events. \n \n31.  The estimation of sea level rise (SLR) was based on a 25-year dataset of water levels \nrecorded at the QSIW\u2019s tide gauge and on the very high emissions scenario RCP8.5 to define a \n0.57 m SLR by 2070. A storm surge level of 2.3 m mean sea level (MSL) was defined as design \ncriterion, which corresponds to 50-year annual recurrence intervals without SLR and 20-year \nannual recurrence intervals with SLR by 2050. The existing deck level of the wharves is adequate \nfor the 2070 SLR under normal port operations. The container yard will be raised to at least \n2.3 MSL, while the perimeter of the site will be raised to 2.6 MSL matching the current level of the \nwharves. \n \n32.  Given the high seismicity of the area, standards by the American Society of Civil Engineers \nand the Permanent International Association of Navigation Congresses were used to provide \nsuitable specifications for marine structures in high seismic locations. Australian standards were \nadopted for works without seismic considerations. The project also finances the implementation \nof  smart  port  components  such  as  LED  lighting  with  \u201csmart  features\u201d  to  reduce  energy \nconsumption, installation of closed-circuit television (CCTV) with motion detectors to increase \nsecurity, installation of a self-contained fuel system that captures fuel usage to implement eco-\ndriving and prevent oil spill risks, and installation of a wave-measuring device that aids in \noperations and vessel routing. \n \n33.  The  main  lessons  from  the  earlier  Transport  Infrastructure  Project  (para.  21)  are \nincorporated in this project: (i) allowance for a longer construction schedule so marine work can \nbe done outside the cyclone season, and (ii) use of imported precast concrete elements (avoiding \nhighly porous local aggregates) to prevent premature degradation and reduce maintenance costs. \nThe design life target for the exposed marine work was raised to 50 years in response to the \nobserved deterioration of such work in wharf no. 1. \n \n34.  The detailed design consultant prepared cost estimates with cost information from its own \ndatabank using specialized cost estimators from consultations with potential suppliers of major \ninputs and using as a reference similar marine works conducted in Tonga to build the cruise \nterminal, Vuna Wharf (completed in 2011), and the domestic passenger terminal (completed in \n2017). An independent consulting firm with international experience in similar maritime projects \nundertook a third-party review of the detailed engineering designs to ensure their quality. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n35.  The project will allow the safe and efficient operation of Nuku\u2019alofa Port, a lifeline asset for \nTonga, and will increase the resilience of the port to climate and disasters. The project has a \nbasic-needs aspect and one of basic public goods and services, since a without-project scenario \nwould have serious negative impacts on the country if the population were no longer able to import \nbasic goods. The feasibility study assessed several investment options and selected the most \n ", "9 \ncost-effective one. Notwithstanding the above, ADB carried out a cost\u2013benefit analysis of the \nproposed investment. 24 \n \n36.  The port rehabilitation and extension will allow maintaining the operational capacity of the \nQSIW; reduce the risk arising during loading and unloading of container ships because of the \ncurrent wharf length; and increase the vessel size that can be serviced by the port, which will \nlower the unit cost of shipping. Since Nuku\u2019alofa Port at present prevents the deployment of larger \nships serving this route in the Pacific region, the removal of this constraint will also benefit other \nislands in the region. A smaller number of larger vessels will also result in a substantial reduction \nin greenhouse gas emissions and cost savings for ship operators that could be transferred to the \nusers. Other improvements (container yard, smart port) will provide additional benefits thanks to \nan increase in yard storage capacity, stronger operational efficiency, less electricity consumption, \nreduced cargo loss and theft, and lower maintenance costs. \n \n37.  The economic analysis includes the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on global \ntrade, which are mainly lower growth projections, forecast by the International Monetary Fund in \nApril 2020, and the deferment of the deployment of larger container vessels in line with the \nexpected slack in demand growth in the South Pacific region. The analysis suggests that the \nproposed improvements are economically viable with an economic internal rate of return of 9.9%. \nA sensitivity analysis testing the effects of possible unfavorable changes in the key parameters \nthat  determine  the  project\u2019s  costs  and  benefits  indicates  that  economic  viability  remains \nsatisfactory with an economic internal rate of return of 8.5% or above. \n \n38.  The financial evaluation of the project indicates that the net incremental benefits are \npositive. The project is an essential public infrastructure investment, and primary considerations \nare its economic viability and financial sustainability, so a financial sustainability analysis was \ncarried out. Based on historic financial performance, the financial analysis of the Nuku\u2019alofa Port \noperations indicates that the financial standing of PAT is strong with consistent net profit. Financial \nprojections of PAT's operations with the project were made based on projected demand and \noperational needs over a 20-year period to assess whether PAT will be able to allocate sufficient \nfunds for the annual maintenance and periodical repairs. An analysis of net operating cash flow \nbefore maintenance and repair indicates a coverage ratio of more than 3 for the maintenance and \nrepair needs throughout the analysis period. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n39.  The project, along with the planned capital investment by the port, will rehabilitate and \nupgrade the port facility to serve the port traffic for the next 20 years up to 2040. ADB conducted \na review of PAT\u2019s asset management practices and concluded that the sustainability risk is \nsubstantial. While the financial analysis indicates that the port generates sufficient cash flow to \ncover the maintenance needs, PAT has no technical capacity to undertake routine and periodic \nmaintenance of its assets nor does it set aside adequate funds for maintenance. The project \nincludes the implementation of an AMP set out in the PAM (para. 19, footnote 17), to ensure \nsustainable maintenance of the port assets. To meet the maintenance needs of the port facilities \nduring the life of the project and ensure their sustainability, the AMP calls for the (i) creation of a \nmajor maintenance reserve account by PAT; (ii) establishment of an asset management unit; and \n(iii) forecast of costs associated with the maintenance of the project, as well as identification of \nthe sources of funding to meet those costs. \n \n \n24 Financial Analysis and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nD.  Governance \n \n40.  Financial  management.  The  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  in \nDecember 2018 for the PRF and updated in February 2020 for the project, in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects and the Financial Due \nDiligence: A Methodology Note. The financial management assessment considered the capacity \nof MOF and MOI, including funds-flow arrangements, staffing, accounting and financial reporting \nsystems, financial information systems, asset management, and internal and external auditing \narrangements. The financial management capacity of MOF as executing agency and of MOI as \nimplementing  agency  is  considered  adequate. The  agencies  also  have  proven capacity  to \nmanage the advance account. It is concluded that the overall pre-mitigation financial management \nrisk of MOF and MOI is moderate. Weaknesses were found in the internal audit function, which \nMOF needs to extend to its line agencies. Also, the PMU needs strengthening to deepen its \nknowledge of ADB\u2019s disbursement procedures and reporting requirements. Finally, the assets \nregister must be updated to correctly define the budgetary allocation for maintenance. \n \n41.  Procurement. The overall (post-mitigation) project procurement risk is rated medium. \nStrategic procurement planning (para. 28) led to the conclusion that MOF and MOI have limited \nprocurement experience when it comes to major projects financed by development partners, and \nlittle or no resources for the preparation of the technical aspects of bidding documents or the \nsupervision of contracts. The planning report recommends the following mitigation measures: \n(i) provision of a construction supervision consultant with international expertise to help the PMU \noversee the civil works and project implementation; (ii) ADB\u2019s prior review of draft prequalification \nand bidding documents, and of prequalification and bid evaluation reports; (iii) provision of a \ndetailed design consultant to support all procurement activities; and (iv) continued individual \nconsulting support to the PMU on contract management and project implementation. \n \n42.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, MOF, and MOI. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 17). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social and Gender \n \n43.  Poverty and social. The construction works to upgrade the port will create jobs for the \ncommunity, and a more effective international seaport will also enable more local economic \nactivity. The improved facilities will ensure better health and safety conditions for workers, reduce \ndelays in cargo operations, and increase the turnaround of ships. The benefits of an optimized \ncontainer terminal and port precinct will help reduce the cost of cargo, and may also translate into \na lower cost of goods in the domestic market. \n \n44.  Gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. The project is categorized effective \ngender mainstreaming, and the project includes a gender action plan. The project promotes \nemployment, training, and microbusiness opportunities for women, including technical work \npositions; and helps rectify the issue of women\u2019s low participation in the labor force. It aims to \nensure a gender-sensitive workplace environment through the provision of equal pay for equal \nwork; gender-sensitive infrastructure (e.g., women\u2019s facilities, night lighting, security features); the \nformulation of a gender policy; and training for staff on how to prevent or deal with sexual \nexploitation, abuse, and harassment at the workplace, and on gender transformative change in \ngeneral. The project will also have indirect benefits for women, who are often in charge of \nhousehold budgeting, such as lower-cost goods and better flow of goods from improved trade. \n \n ", "11 \nF.  Safeguards \n \n45.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.25 \n \n46.  Environment (category  B). The initial environmental examination (IEE) shows that \nimpacts on the physical, biological, and socioeconomic environment will be minor, few, and \nreversible, if any; and most can be managed during both construction and operation through good \npractice and the implementation of the project\u2019s environmental management plan (EMP). Short-\nterm impacts are anticipated during construction, such as dust, noise, and waste generated by \nlandside and marine civil works, as well as minor community and occupational health and safety \nrisks. A sediment plume analysis showed that any impacts from turbidity will be localized and \ninsignificant. ADB will ensure that its Safeguard Policy Statement and country safeguards are \ncomplied with. In line with ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, the IEE and subsequent monitoring \nreports will be disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. The contractors will prepare a construction EMP \nbased on an updated IEE and project EMP. The PMU, supplemented by the construction \nsupervision consultant, will include safeguard staff who will review and clear the construction \nEMP; MOI will monitor its effectiveness and compliance with it. \n \n47.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  C).  Due  diligence  activities  confirm  that  no \ninvoluntary resettlement impacts will result from the project. The project will be implemented within \nthe existing port area. The land is state-owned and leased to PAT. The improvements to the yard \nand access road take place within the existing leased area. There will be no impacts on non-land \nassets or improvements to land beyond that owned by PAT, and no impacts on land use that \nwould result in physical or economic displacement impacts. The wharf extension to the south-\nwest will require a permit and the submission of a lease application to the Crown, in line with \nTongan law. The permit and lease will be obtained before construction starts. Fishing and other \nnon-port activities are already prohibited within the jurisdiction of the port, and the project will not \nhave an adverse effect on fishing or tourism-related livelihoods. The due diligence found no \nlegacy issues concerning land that would require corrective actions. Key stakeholders were \nconsulted and will continue to be consulted during implementation. The Social Safeguards Due \nDiligence Report, as well as the IEE, provide details on the project-specific grievance redress \nmechanism. The PMU and the construction supervision consultant will monitor compliance with \nthe social safeguards. \n \n48.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project will not impact any distinct and vulnerable \ngroups of indigenous people. The project is limited to civil works within the existing port facilities, \nin Tonga's capital, and to some capacity-building activities for employees of PAT. The project \nbeneficiaries are part of the mainstream Tongan society. Nearly the entire population of Tonga is \nconsidered to be of Polynesian ancestry. \n \nG.
