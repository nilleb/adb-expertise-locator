INTRODUCTION \n1.  At the request of the Government of Indonesia, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nfielded a Fact-Finding Mission in July 2005 to formulate technical assistance (TA)1 for the \npreparation of the Second Community and Local Government Support (CLGS II) Sector Project \nin Indonesia, in particular, to foster investment in community-level infrastructure to support local \neconomic development and generate improved income opportunities. Mission members held \ndiscussions with officials of the National Development Planning Agency (Badan Perencanaan \nPembangunan  Nasional  or  BAPPENAS),  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  provincial  and  local \ngovernments.2  Understanding  was  reached  on  the  objectives,  scope,  cost  estimates, \nimplementation arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA. The design and monitoring \nframework is attached as Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Indonesia has achieved impressive poverty reduction in recent decades, despite the \nsetbacks that occurred as a result of the 1997 Asian financial crisis. In 2004, at 16.7% of the \npopulation, the incidence of poverty was once again below precrisis levels; however, more than \n36 million people were living below the poverty line. In addition, a large proportion of the \npopulation is highly vulnerable to falling into poverty.3 The average poverty incidence figures \nfurther mask significant regional disparities.4  \n \n3.  Indonesia still has one of the lowest levels of investment in infrastructure as a proportion \nof gross domestic product, especially by private entities.5 In 2003, Indonesia was ranked lowest \namong 30 countries, with populations in excess of 30 million, in relation to its physical and social \ninfrastructure.6  All  sectors  face  significant  infrastructure  deficiencies.  Only  39%  of  urban \npopulations are serviced by urban water supplies; road density levels are 1.6 kilometers per \n1,000 people; electricity consumption is just 319 kilowatt-hours per person per year, with 45% of \nhouseholds not connected to electricity; and only 3% of urban areas have fixed line telephones, \nwith only 27 lines per 1,000 people.7 Problems include not just the lack of services, but the \nquality of services is poor, the level of maintenance is minimal, cost recovery of services are \nlimited and nurture inequities, the regulatory framework is biased and inconsistent, and the \ncapacity for funding infrastructure is limited. \n \n4.  The Government and ADB have extensive experience with community infrastructure \ndevelopment, participatory planning, and project implementation, as well as with local capacity \ndevelopment.  This  experience  has  been  gained  during  the  implementation  of  the  First \nCommunity and Local Government Support Project (CLGS I). CLGS I has achieved its targets \nand objectives, and the executing agency, BAPPENAS, demonstrated its capacity to efficiently \nimplement  the  Project  by  supporting  the  construction  of  17,237  public  facilities  involving \ncommunity efforts (type A projects) and an additional 3,076 community facilities using block \ngrants. Infrastructure eligible for funding (type B projects) included (i) water supply, (ii) drainage, \n(iii) irrigation, (iv) local roads and bridges, (v) public toilets, (vi) markets, (vii) school buildings, \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 4 August 2005. \n2  Provinces of West Kalimantan and North Sumatra, district and city of Pontianak, and district of Tanah Karo. \n3  A different method of poverty measurement uses the international standard \u2018poverty line\u2019 defined by a consumption \nlevel of $1/day. The population identified as poor (1993 purchasing power parity) poverty line was only 7.5% in \n2002, but this headcount leaps dramatically to 52.4% when the $2 per day poverty line is applied.   \n4  The incidence of poverty was still high in such outlying provinces as Papua (39%) and Maluku (32%). By contrast, \nit was relatively low in Bali (7%) and the metropolitan region of Jakarta (3.2%).  \n5  Widely noted by participants at the Infrastructure Summit, Jakarta.

The use of loan funds, which were provided as seed money, has been effective and \nefficient, and these community-based development efforts are known for their high degree of \ntransparency. Communities have added substantially to the Project through additional noncash \ncontributions, which have occasionally amounted to two or three times the value of project \nfunding. Loan disbursement has been 97% and Government contributions have reached 96.6% \nof envisaged amounts.  \n \n5.  Local  governments  have  demonstrated  their  strong  appreciation  of  CLGS  I  and  its \ncontributions to village development. The 79 participating local governments have built new \ncapacities in handling bottom-up development and in dealing with a large number of community \ngroups. The communities, particularly local women\u2019s organizations, have been a driving force \nfor subproject identification, planning, and implementation. This confirms the availability of local \nknowledge and the capacity of communities and their organizations, which thereby reduces the \nneed for technical or consultant backup. The contribution of communities can reduce the need \nfor contractors, and supervision by communities reduces the costs of subprojects. Communities \nhave been willing to commit to operating and maintaining facilities built under the Project. Thus \nthe success of CLGS I on the one hand, and the continued poverty and need for infrastructure \ninvestment on the other hand, have prompted the Government\u2019s request for CLGS II, to be \nimplemented in other areas not covered by CLGS I, but within the main geographical focus of \nADB\u2019s country strategy and program (CSP).8  Lessons learnt under CLGS I will help in the \nformulation and implementation of CLGS II. \n \n6.  A strong linkage exists between poverty and lack of access to infrastructure. Improved \nlocal community infrastructure can result in better health and education, safe water supply and \nsanitation, and improved access to economic opportunities. All these are basic rights in the \nGovernment's  poverty  reduction  strategy  paper,  as  incorporated  into  the  Medium-Term \nDevelopment Plan for 2005\u20132009. The provision of infrastructure for poor communities will also \nhelp achieve the Millennium Development Goals, namely, targets 1, 3, and 10.  \n \n7.  Decentralization has led to significant changes in the Government\u2019s approach to regional \ndevelopment. As the central Government no longer has the power or resources to directly \nsupport regional development, regions are forced to fund more of their own investment needs. \nIn addition, the central Government has often directed investment toward regions that offer a \ncompetitive advantage to large corporations and investors to the exclusion of other regions. The \nproportion of private, especially foreign, investment in poorer regions is still low, and in most \nregions the capacity of institutions remains weak and inefficient. Hence CLGS II will not only \nface the challenge of providing investment for infrastructure development, but also of building \nthe capacity of local governments and local community organizations, which are the facilitators \nand drivers of participatory development.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The  TA  will  help  the  Government  identify  and  prepare  a  project  that  will  improve \ncommunity members\u2019 access to basic public infrastructure in poor urban, peri-urban, and rural \nareas and that will (i) increase employment and income opportunities, (ii) establish and/or \n                                                 \n8  The current geographical focus includes North Sumatra, South Sumatra, Lampung, Banten, West Java, Central \nJava, Special Area of Yogyakarta, East Java, West Nusa Tengara, and Southeast Sulawesi. However, the revised \nCSP may redefine geographical focus. \n ", "  3\nstrengthen community-based institutions, and (iii) improve local governments\u2019 capacity to handle \ncommunity-based development.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will help the Government prepare each project component and is structured to \nspecifically address each of the components.9 The TA will analyze the feasibility of the new \napproach to providing community infrastructure provision through on-lending instead of on-\ngranting. It will help about 25 to 30 selected local governments (see the map)10 to prepare \nsubproject appraisal reports (SPARs). Of these, three districts will be chosen as pilot areas \nbased on the districts\u2019 demonstrated commitment to pro-poor development and transparent and \naccountable governance, the participation of local stakeholders, and the demonstrated need. \nThe TA will build on experience gained during CLGS I and will align this new project with other \nADB-funded projects, including the Sustainable Capacity Building for Decentralization Project, \nthe  Local  Government  Finance  and  Government  Reform  Sector  Development  Project,  the \nCommunity Water and Health Project, and the Decentralized Pro-Poor Budgeting and Service \nDelivery Project. As much as possible, CLGS II will be aligned and harmonized with the World \nBank-funded Kecamatan Development Project and will avoid geographical overlap with it. The \nProject  supports  participatory,  decentralized  budgeting,  and  thereby  strengthens  the \nGovernment\u2019s decentralization agenda and the sustainability of the community infrastructure \ndevelopment.  \n \n10.  Part 1: Project Investment Design and Feasibility Analysis. These activities will lead \nto the design of a proposal for CLGS II. The project design will describe the policy of and \nstrategy for providing poor communities in urban, peri-urban, and rural locations with access to \ninfrastructure so as to improve local economic development and employment opportunities, \npromote the empowerment of local communities through inclusive participation in all stages of \ndevelopment planning and implementation, and build local government capacities to facilitate \nsuch  bottom-up  development  initiatives.  Due  consideration  will  be  given  to  technical, \nenvironmental,  social,  and  institutional  feasibility  and  the  economic  viability  and  financial \nsustainability of districts\u2019 investments, taking into account impacts on poverty reduction and \nlocal  economic  development,  cost-recovery,  inability  to  recover  costs,  leverage  further \ninvestment, and operation and maintenance.  \n \n11.  The format for local investment plans or SPARs will have six elements: (i) profile of \ncommunities,  recommended  service  standards,  and  priorities;  (ii)  preliminary  designs;  (iii) \nestimated  inputs  and  costs;  (iv)  plausible  subproject  financing,  including  central  and  local \ngovernment, private sector, and community financing; (v) implementation arrangements, and \n(vi) implementation schedules. The average investment package will amount to approximately \n$3 million per district. The project design shall assure that CLGS II funds are well integrated with \nthe decentralized mechanisms for budgeting and fund administration. Of particular importance for \nproject preparation will be the participatory framework for project formulation, implementation \nand monitoring, and maintenance and the direct involvement of beneficiary communities and \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) based on the participatory planning, monitoring, and \nevaluation  methodology  already  developed  during  CLGS  I.  However,  because  CLGS  II \nsubprojects are financed from the loan, detailed investment plans are required prior to CLGS II \napproval. This in turn affects the community participation process, which needs to be adapted \nand  converted  to  a  two-stage  process,  with  (i)  a  preliminary  planning  phase,  and  (ii)  a \n                                                 \n9  Eligible CLGS II investment component include drinking water; washing, bathing, and toilet facilities; drainage; \nirrigation; markets; village roads and footpaths; bridges; boat piers and harbors; schools; health posts; and \nelectricity connections. \n10 The selection of provinces will be aligned and consistent with the geographic focus of the CSP. \n ", "4   \nmechanism for detailed action planning once subprojects are starting implementation. As the \nnumber of participating districts is fairly large, the TA will concentrate on three pilot districts for \ndeveloping  a  comprehensive,  integrated,  and  participatory  SPAR  format  that  meets  ADB \nrequirements; will guide and support the other 22 to 27 participating local governments in \npreparing  their  investment  plans;  and  will  interact  with  local  communities,  NGOs,  and \ncommunity-based organizations during the formulation of SPARs. It is assumed that with the \nhelp of the TA consultants, participating local governments will be able to develop their own \nSPARs.11 The TA will also determine the requirements for implementing this part of the Project \nthrough a sector project. \n \n12.  Part  2:  Sector  Strengthening.  The  TA  will  review  the  existing  organizational  and \nfinancial framework for village-level or settlement-level infrastructure investments that will target \nthe poor. Because the pattern of on-granting used for CLGS I is probably no longer applicable, \nCLGS II will need to establish either full or partial cost recovery as a basic principle. The \ninterpretation and application of Ministry of Finance regulation KMK35/2003 will be critical for \nthe  Project.  In  the  context  of  regulations  governing  the  financing  of  projects  under \ndecentralization, the application this regulation is expected to lead to two types of funding \narrangements for CLGS II, namely: (i) on-lending for cost-recovery subsectors, and (ii) on-\ngranting for noncost-recovery subsectors.12 The sector review will also include the compilation \nof baseline data regarding the preproject status of community infrastructure in the proposed \ndistricts and provinces. A review and adjustment of the participatory planning, monitoring, and \nevaluation approach of CLGS I and its modification under CLGS II resulting from the shift from \nblock grants to the concept of SPAR preparation prior to project appraisal will necessitate \nadjustments of the CLGS community participation methodology. In addition, the sector review \nwill  identify  core  capacity-building  requirements  of  participating  local  governments  for  the \nimplementation of CLGS II.13 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $800,000 equivalent, comprising $200,000 in \nforeign exchange and $600,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested \nthat ADB finance $600,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign currency cost and $400,000 \nequivalent of local currency costs. The Government will finance the remaining local currency \ncosts,  amounting  to  $200,000  equivalent,  which  will  cover  office  and  support  facilities, \ncounterpart staff, administrative support, part of workshop expenses, report production and \ndissemination, and local transportation. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. Details of the cost estimates and a financing plan are shown in Appendix 2. \nThe Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance \nany ensuing project. \n \n                                                 \n11 The TA consultants will develop a system of workshops and technical support that will enable all candidate districts \nto formulate their draft SPARs in accordance with guidelines and formats developed in the three pilot districts. \n12 Cost recovery in certain subsectors where costs are recoverable will mean that community organizations will need \nto undertake additional tasks. The noncost-recovery subsectors may be funded by the national budget, by district \nor city budgets, or by other grant funding sources from bilateral donors. In accordance with the new directives of \nthe Ministry of Finance, TA for project implementation, that is, expenses for consultants, community facilitators, and \ncapacity-building activities, need to be downscaled and loan funding can only be used to a limited extent \n(tentatively 7\u201310% of a total investment package), which implies that other sources need to be mobilized.  \n13 Local government capacity will be assessed prior to the incorporation of districts into the Project. The capacity \nmapping tools of the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit-sponsored Support for Decentralization \nMeasures will be recommended. ADB\u2019s Regional Sustainable Development Department might be able to support the \nformulation and assessment of district capacities for CLGS II through a capacity-building project sponsored by the \nBritish Department for International Development, or an ADB-sponsored training program in Indonesia. \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  BAPPENAS (deputy for infrastructure) will be the Executing Agency for this TA. A project \nmanagement unit (PMU) to be established within BAPPENAS will organize the technical and \nadministrative aspects of the TA. Suitably qualified and experienced counterpart staff will work \nalongside the TA consultants under the direction of the head of the PMU. The TA consultants \nwill fully support the head of the PMU and will work in close collaboration with the counterpart \nteam. The consultants will procure equipment for the TA and will hand this equipment over to \nthe PMU when the final report is submitted. A steering committee, chaired by BAPPENAS and \nmade up of senior officials of the Ministry of Public Works, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry \nof Home Affairs, and the Regional Autonomy Advisory Council, will be established to guide and \noversee TA implementation. A working group chaired by Deputy Infrastructure of BAPPENAS, \nand consisting of representatives from BAPPENAS, the Ministry of Public Works, the Ministry of \nFinance, the Ministry of Home Affairs, and the Regional Autonomy Advisory Council and other \nnominated  representatives  of  regional  governments,  NGOs,  and  universities  will  provide \ncounterpart support for the consultants.  \n \n15.  The consultants for the Project will undertake a detailed feasibility assessment of the \noverall Project according to ADB policies and procedures. The TA report will provide a detailed \nexplanation regarding cost recovery of subprojects and project description, including rationale \nand expected outcomes, benefits, and poverty impact analysis (Appendix 3); a fully developed \nlogical  framework;  the  geographic  scope;  the  lending  modality  and  subsidiary  loan \narrangements, if needed; and an assessment of implementing agencies along with estimates of \ninputs and costs and implementation arrangements and schedule. All subcomponents will be \nanalyzed,  as  appropriate,  for  technical,  financial,  economic,  social,  environmental,  and \ninstitutional viability and sustainability. The TA will also undertake on-the-job and formal training \nof pertinent national agencies and local governments.  \n \n16.  The TA will require a minimum input of 8 person-months of international and 38 person-\nmonths of domestic consulting services with expertise in community development, management \ninformation systems, civil engineering, financial analysis, regional development planning, and \nprocurement. The consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants, using the quality- and cost-based selection method and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. All procurement under the TA will follow \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  The  consultants  will  be  based  in  Jakarta  and  will  be \nexpected to travel as necessary to the regions. The proposed outline terms of reference for the \nconsultants are in Appendix 4. \n \n17.  The TA is expected to begin in November 2005 and be implemented over 6 months, with \nthe final report produced in May 2006 and with intermittent inputs supporting project appraisal \nthereafter. Tripartite reviews will be held after inception, at the time of the first interim report, and \nat  the  draft  final  report  stage.  Corresponding  to  these  reviews,  stakeholder  consultation \nworkshops will be held to present progress to, and obtain input from, central Government \nagencies, local governments, civil society, and representatives of the communities involved. \n \nIV.
