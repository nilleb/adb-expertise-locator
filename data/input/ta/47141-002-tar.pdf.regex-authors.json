The Government  of Thailand  requested  support from the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  to  identify,  assess,  and  develop  capacity  regarding  health  sector  public\u2013private \npartnerships (PPPs). ADB has worked with the government on broader PPP issues, including \ndevelopment of a revised PPP legal framework. The Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) has \ndemonstrated particular interest in using PPPs to deliver public services. The proposal was \ndiscussed in detail with the government during ADB missions in February and October 2013. \nThe government concurred with the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, \ncost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference. The design and monitoring framework is \nin Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Thailand is an upper middle-income country, and is aspiring to achieve high-income \nstatus.  However,  Thailand\u2019s  unmet  demand  for  social  services  has  a  serious  impact  on \nproductivity and the achievement of sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction. The \ncountry\u2019s  social  indicators  have  improved  steadily,  but  significant  disparities  remain,  with \nunequal access to resources and social services. Available public sector funding is inadequate, \nand PPPs are seen as an important means of improving efficiency and the effectiveness of \nservice delivery to citizens.2 A new legal framework for PPPs was developed with ADB support, \nand is expected to help mobilize private investment in public economic and social infrastructure \nprojects.  Effective  implementation  of  the  new  PPP  framework  will  be  vital  to  building  the \nconfidence of the private sector and other stakeholders. \n \n3.  Thailand\u2019s  large, complex  public  and  private  health  sector  provides  services  to  the \npopulation of 68 million, and additionally seeks to become a  prominent regional center of \nexcellence for medical and health care. The Thai healthcare system  combines public and \nprivate sector financing and care provision. In 2008, total health expenditures represented some \n4% of gross domestic product, about three-quarters of which was covered by the public sector. \nGovernment health spending finances the provision of public health services performed by the \nMinistry of Public Health (MOPH) and other government agencies, including the planning and \nadministration of hospital and health service operations, the provision of healthcare information, \nand  research  and  development.  The  private  sector  in  Thailand  plays  a  significant  role  in \nproviding health care, particularly in Bangkok and provincial urban centers. The private sector \naccounts for about one-quarter of health care expenditure, about two-thirds of which is financed \nby out-of-pocket spending by patients.3 In 2009, less than one-third of Thailand\u2019s more than 320 \nprivate hospitals were in Bangkok.  \n \n4.  Remarkable progress has been made in basic health care, with significant declines in \ninfant  and  maternal  mortality  rates.  Nevertheless,  MOPH  faces  a  number  of  challenges, \nincluding demographic change, with a rapidly aging population that poses challenges for social \nsecurity  and  health  expenditure  management;  increasing  utilization  of  health  services; \nincreasing demand for high-cost technology and ageing facilities; inefficiencies in the large \npublic  hospital  infrastructure;  and  lack  of  regional  integration  in  health  services.  These \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 13 November 2013.  \n2  ADB has supported PPP development in several developing member countries, including India, the Philippines, \nThailand, and Viet Nam. \n3  ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance for Mainstreaming Public\u2013Private Partnerships in Thailand. Manila (TA7540-\nTHA).  \n ", "2   \nchallenges pressure the public sector to provide good quality health services with appropriately \nequipped health facilities of good standard.4 \n \n5.  MOPH has demonstrated considerable interest in developing services and supporting \nfacilities that use PPPs as a way to address these challenges. However, the current institutional \nsetup and capacity of MOPH cannot effectively promote and implement PPP health projects. \nADB provided MOPH with initial PPP-related technical assistance (TA) that reviewed PPP-\nrelated health policies and conducted a rapid sector diagnostics analysis and PPP project \nidentification program (footnote 3). This initial ADB assistance provided a useful foundation for \nfurther work, but was limited by the lack of an effective PPP legal and regulatory framework in \nThailand. The government developed, with ADB assistance, the Private Investments in State \nUndertakings  (PISU)  Act  to  help  mobilize  private  funding;  improve  efficiency,  access,  and \nquality of infrastructure and public services; and define an institutional framework for PPPs.  \n \n6.  The PISU Act was enacted in April 2013 and represents a fundamental change from the \nprior law (the Private Participation in State Undertaking Act of 1992). The key features of the \nPISU Act include (i) development of a PPP strategic plan to provide clear direction regarding the \nsectors and types of investments in which private participation is encouraged; (ii) establishment \nof a PPP policy committee, with the State Enterprise Policy Office (SEPO) acting as the policy \ncommittee\u2019s secretariat; (iii) streamlined procedures; (iv) standard contract terms and guidelines \non post-contract project management; and (v) a project development fund. Although SEPO has \na key oversight role under the PISU Act, MOPH has primary responsibility for identifying and \ntransacting  projects.  Importantly,  the  PISU  Act  foresees  both  revenue-generating  and \navailability-payment PPP projects. Efforts are underway to implement the framework set out \nunder the PISU Act. Effective implementation will be essential in building the confidence of the \nprivate sector and other stakeholders in the new PPP framework.  \n \n 7.  In  response to  the  opportunity created  by  the  enactment  of the  PISU  Act  and the \ninstitutional framework, and the continuing challenges faced in the health sector, MOPH has \nrequested further technical support from ADB to develop its capacity to use PPPs. The health-\nrelated PPP projects have yet to be selected, but the ADB PPP TA (footnote 3) identified a \nnumber  of  possible  health  PPPs  that  could  be  considered,  including  onsite  laboratory \nmanagement services, advanced imaging radiological services, development of new hospital \nfacilities  and  infrastructure,  cardiac  and  cancer  medical  center  provision,  geriatric  medical \nservices  provision  and  \u201chot  floor\u201d  (i.e.,  intensive  care  and  operating  theater)  infrastructure \nrefurbishment and provision, as well as noncore activities such as contracting out building \nservices and car parks.  \n \n8.  There is a strong rationale for the development and use of PPPs in the financing and \ndelivery  of  health  care  services  in  Thailand.  Importantly,  PPPs  provide  a  mechanism  for \nchanneling private sector resources towards the improving access to, and the quality of, the \npublic  health  care  system  in  Thailand.  While  the  private  health  sector  is  large,  its  main \nbeneficiaries are those who can afford to pay for services out-of-pocket or who benefit from \nhealth insurance coverage. In contrast, the bulk of the population is able to access only public \nhealth care services, where standards are generally lower because of excess demand for \nservices, shortages of professional clinicians and a lack of funding for services and facilities. \n                                                \n4  See for example M. Lindelow et al. 2012. Government Spending and Central\u2013Local Relations in Thailand\u2019s Health \nSector. HNP Discussion Paper. Washington, D.C.: World Bank; R. Dauskardt and O. Kovindha. 2012.

Manila: \nAsian Development Bank.  \n ", "  3 \nPPPs will allow the resources and expertise of the large and growing private health care sector \nto be extended to those who rely solely on the public sector for health care delivery in Thailand.   \n \n 9.  MOPH, in cooperation with SEPO, has conducted a bottom-up exercise and identified 14 \npotential  types  of  PPP  initiatives  across  four  priority  areas.  The  development  of  PPPs  in \nSoutheast Asia has been limited, particularly in the health sector. Private investment in health \ncare in the region has tended to focus on private tertiary (i.e., specialist) care. For a variety of \nreasons (e.g., perceived risk; planning, licensing, and construction timeframes; and the short \ninvestment horizons of investors), the appetite for greenfield development in the health sector in \nSoutheast Asia has been limited, with most of the focus given to enhancing or adding capacity \nto  existing  structures.  Some  PPPs  in  health  are  emerging  in  Southeast  Asia,  e.g.,  the \ndevelopment of a teaching hospital for the Islamic University Malaysia in Kuantan.5  \n \n10.  While the focus of the TA will be on the health sector, experience and lessons will also \nbe applied to the education sector by way of initial scoping work on the potential for PPPs in \neducation. Despite relatively good resource allocation and success in increasing enrolment, \nThailand\u2019s education outcomes need further improvement in order to maintain high economic \ngrowth. Issues include matching demand and supply, access to quality education, the efficient \nuse of resources, and accountability and performance-based delivery. The TA will assess the \npotential for PPPs in the education sector in Thailand, highlight potential education PPP models \nthat could be considered, and identify lessons from the health sector.  \n \n11.  ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2013\u20132016 for Thailand has a strong focus on \ndeveloping the private sector and catalyzing private investment and finance.6 Under the country \npartnership strategy, ADB is committed to helping to strengthen the enabling environment for \nPPPs and Thailand\u2019s capacity to identify, develop, and finance suitable PPP projects. ADB is \ncurrently providing assistance to the Ministry of Finance (through SEPO) to help mainstream the \nnew  PPP  framework.  Specifically,  the  ongoing  assistance  to  SEPO  includes  activities  to \nstrengthen PPP units and governance structures, prepare viable PPP project pipelines in priority \nsectors, structure and operate a project development fund, and design a government support \nand risk management framework.7  The proposed TA will complement the ongoing assistance \nwith a particular focus on the health sector, with an extension to the education sector. The TA \nwill be an integral part of the package to support the PPP agenda, and as such may lead to \nopportunities for ADB finance instruments, both sovereign and nonsovereign.8 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The TA\u2019s impact will be increased private sector engagement in the health sector for the \ndelivery of efficient and quality services. The target will be an increase from zero to three in the \nnumber of public health facilities providing services through PPPs. The TA outcome will be \nMOPH PPP project pipeline identified and PPP project development commenced. The targets \n                                                \n5  PwC. 2012.

Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA will develop PPP policy and institutional frameworks in the health sector under \nPISU, assist in the identification of potential PPP projects in the health sector, and build the \ncapacity of MOPH to identify and develop PPP projects in the health sector. Expected TA \noutputs are as follows: \n(i)  Output 1: Enabling environment for public\u2013private partnerships in health \nstrengthened. The TA will develop PPP policy and institutional frameworks in \nthe health sector under PISU, including (a) assessing policies, regulations, and \nsystems; (b) assisting in the development of the MOPH policy framework to feed \ninto  the  PPP  strategic  plan  being  developed  by  SEPO;  (c)  establishing  a \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  mechanism  for  PPP  implementation;  and                  \n(d)  developing  and  recommending  efficient  mechanisms  for  PPP  dispute \nresolution. A scoping study will also be carried out to examine the potential for \nPPPs in the education sector and the degree to which the lessons from health \nPPP arrangements can be applied to, and replicated in, the education sector.    \n(ii)  Output 2: Capacity of the Ministry of Public Health to identify and develop \npublic\u2013private  partnership  projects  enhanced.  The  TA  will  assist  in                     \n(a) establishing a PPP-TSU in MOPH, (b) developing a PPP strategic plan and a \nlist of potential PPP projects in the health sector that would form part of the \nnational PPP strategic plan of SEPO, and (c) conducting capacity building for the \nPPP-TSU to develop and support well-structured PPPs in the health sector. \n(iii)  Output  3:  Public\u2013private  partnership  project  prefeasibility  studies \nprepared. The TA will support the identification and development of one to two \nbankable PPP health projects by (a) establishing mechanisms to support the \nPPP project development cycle, (b) identifying potential pilot PPP health projects, \nand  (c)  developing  prefeasibility  studies  for  the  selected  PPP  pilot  health \nprojects.     \n   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,430,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of office accommodation, transport, utilities, seminar \nroom space, and remuneration of counterpart staff; as well as provision of data, reports, and \nother relevant documents and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  MOPH will be the executing agency. The TA will be implemented in close coordination \nwith the PPP unit in SEPO. The overall work of the TA will be overseen by an MOPH executive \ncommittee, with implementation led by an MOPH deputy permanent secretary. Responsibility for \nday-to-day implementation will be with the head of the Health Affairs Administrative Section of \nthe Bureau of Health Administration under the Office of the Permanent Secretary. The MOPH \nwill be provided with secretariat staff under the TA to support implementation. A PPP-TSU will \nbe  established  under  the  MOPH.  The  TA  will  closely  coordinate  with  and  build  on  ADB \nassistance being provided to the MOF to support implementation of PPP programs. The outputs \n ", "  5 \nof the two TA projects will be fully integrated to develop a coherent policy and institutional \nframework, including an implementation process for PPPs.  \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 24 months from January 2014 to December \n2015. ADB will recruit a team of international and national consultants to provide specialized \nservices totaling 41 person-months (22 person-months of international and 19 person-months of \nnational services) in the areas of PPPs, legal and regulatory issues, health economics, project \nfinance,  health  technical  advice,  PPPs  in  education,  and  communications  and  knowledge \nmanagement. Consultants will be recruited through a firm and will include (i) PPP specialist and \nteam leader (international, 8 person-months); (ii) legal and regulatory specialist (international \nand national, 3 person-months each); (iii) health economist (international, 3 person-months); (iv) \nproject  finance  specialist  (international,  3  person-months);  (v)  health  technical  specialist \n(international, 3 person-months); (vi) education PPP specialist (international and national, 2 \nperson-months  each);  (vii)  health  technical  specialist  and  deputy  team  leader  (national,  8 \nperson-months); and (viii) communications and knowledge management specialist (national, 6 \nperson-months). The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3.  \n \n17.  ADB  will  engage  the  consultants  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time), using quality- and cost-based selection (with \na quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20). The education consultants will work closely with the various \noffices of the Ministry of Education, which will oversee this work. The TA will be managed by the \nconsulting firm. Some ADB staff may be used as resource persons and some representation \ncosts may be charged to the TA. Proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n18.  Regular TA review missions will monitor TA progress and outputs, and provide an \nevaluation in the TA completion report. TA findings and outputs will be disseminated via existing \nADB  external  relations  communication  channels,  as  well  as  through  workshops  and \nconferences, case studies, and articles prepared by the TA consultant team and through the \nhealth PPP website that will be created and operated under the TA.   \n \nIV.
