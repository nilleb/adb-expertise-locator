THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on the proposed loans \nto the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the additional financing of the Jaffna and \nKilinochchi Water Supply Project.1 The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) \nfor Capacity Development of Institutions of Jaffna Water Sector, and if the Board approves the \nproposed loans, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The project will improve drinking water supply in the urban areas of the Jaffna Peninsula, \none of the less-developed regions of Sri Lanka. The additional financing is required to fund the \nchanges in project scope that includes design build and operation (DBO) of a desalination plant; \nand meet the cost overruns of the current project,2 whose performance is on track but requires \nrestructuring to deliver the project outcomes. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Asian Development Bank support for Jaffna. The Jaffna Peninsula, which lies in the \nnorthernmost part of Sri Lanka, was one of the worst-affected areas from years of conflict in the \ncountry, and is an economically lagging region.3 Since the civil war ended in 2009, Jaffna has \nbeen growing with the population expected to increase from 610,000 in 2016 to 900,000 by 2030.4 \nThe  demand  for  basic  urban  services,  including  drinking  water,  is  increasing.  The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) approved the Jaffna and Kilinochchi Water Supply and Sanitation \nProject in November 2010 (current project).5 It was the first initiative by a development partner \nto support Jaffna\u2019s post-conflict development and reconciliation efforts. The current project \naimed to treat, transport, and distribute 27,000 cubic meters (m3) of drinking water per day from \nIranamadu Tank (approximately 30 kilometers away from Jaffna town) to water-scarce Jaffna \nand nearby towns. It also aimed to improve sanitation infrastructure in Jaffna town and water \nresource management in the peninsula. \n \n4.  Performance of current project and its importance. The current project suffered \nsignificant start-up setbacks resulting in implementation delays and cost overruns. The current \nproject was hampered by local farmers\u2019 objection to using Iranamadu Tank\u2019s water for drinking \nwater purposes, despite the consensus reached on water sharing at the loan appraisal stage. The \nremote project location in a post-conflict area also aggravated the challenges due to weak \nimplementation  capacities.  By  2017,  the  ADB-financed  overhead  water  tanks  and  the  51-\nkilometer water pipes had been constructed under the current project. Considering the ongoing \n                                                \n1  The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: \nProposed Loan to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Jaffna and Kilinochchi Water Supply and \nSanitation Project. Manila (Loans 2710/2711-SRI). The project title was revised to Jaffna and Kilinochchi Water \nSupply Project in the project concept paper for additional financing, which ADB approved on 11 March 2016.  \n3  The region has high income poverty and income inequality. Poverty incidence in the Northern Province is estimated \nto be 10.9%, compared with 6.7% for the country as a whole. Government of Sri Lanka, Department of Census and \nStatistics. 2015.

Colombo. \n5  The current project is financed by an ADB loan of $90 million, including an Asian Development Fund loan of $70 \nmillion equivalent (Loan 2711-SRI, now concessional loan from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources as of 1 January \n2017), and ordinary capital resources of $20 million (Loan 2710 \u2013 SRI), along with \u20ac35 million (approximately $40 \nmillion) cofinancing from Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD), and was declared effective in May 2011. \n ", "2 \nand completed works under the current project, and the current project\u2019s critical importance to the \nrehabilitation and reconstruction program of the Northern Province, the benefits of restructuring \nthe current project outweigh those of canceling it. The government is committed to the current \nproject and has dedicated significant resources to improve project implementation, including \nidentifying a new water supply source and meeting the cost overruns.6 As of 15 October 2017, \nthe cumulative current project contract awards totaled $62 million (75% of the ADB loan amounts), \nand disbursements totaled $35.4 million (43% of ADB loan amounts). The project implementation \nincluding the capacity building is rated as on track, and safeguards compliance has been met.7 \n \n5.  Desalination  plant  and  other  sources  to  meet  Jaffna\u2019s  drinking  water  needs. \nAlthough the annual rainfall in Jaffna is around 1,200 millimeters, surface water sources are \nlimited. The peninsula depends heavily on groundwater for drinking water and agriculture, the \nprimary economic activity. However, the groundwater aquifer is at risk from over extraction, \nresulting in the intrusion of seawater.8 Neither groundwater nor local surface water can meet the \nimmediate drinking water demand in Jaffna. After extensive consultations and review of various \noptions, including environmental assessment, a feasibility study identified production of drinking \nwater from seawater through a reverse osmosis desalination process as a necessary interim \nsolution to meet the urgent drinking water needs of Jaffna.9 The project area is expected to \nexperience increase in temperature and rainfall variability due to climate change, leading to higher \nrisk of droughts and worsening of drinking water availability. The desalination plant will directly \naddress water scarcity challenges caused by the climate change. Nevertheless, further efforts to \nuse surface water are still needed to provide drinking water to the entire population of Jaffna, \nwhich will include reaching consensus on using Iranamadu Tank for both irrigation water and \ndrinking water, an integrated water resource management approach, among others.  \n \n6.  Restructuring of the current project. The current project needs restructuring primarily \nto accommodate the change of water source from Iranamadu Tank to a desalination plant and to \nstrengthen the water supply component. The following changes are proposed: (i) inclusion of a \ndesalination plant using a DBO contract; (ii) cancellation of a water treatment plant and bulk water \ntransportation  from  Iranamadu  Tank,  originally  cofinanced  by  the  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nD\u00e9veloppement  (AFD);  (iii)  exclusion  of  the  sewerage  component;10 (iv)  inclusion  of  the \nhousehold water connections; and (v) inclusion of water resource management and outreach \nactivities. Based on the revised cost estimates and the cancellation of the AFD cofinancing, the \ngovernment has requested additional financing of $120 million from ADB to meet the change in \nproject scope and cost overruns.11 The closing date of the current loan has been extended from \n14 August 2017 to 31 December 2020 to complete the revised project scope through the current \nproject and the proposed additional financing.12 \n \n                                                \n6  Cost overruns of $26.7 million were due to delay in the project implementation, and higher bid prices because of \nchallenging working conditions in post-conflict areas.   \n7  Summary of Project Performance and the piggyback TA (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n2). \n8  This had resulted in high salinity of up to 3,000 milligrams per liter in some places. \n9  ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance to Sri Lanka for Rapid Assessment of Sea Water Desalination and Other Alternative \nWater Sources for Jaffna Water Supply. Manila. \n10 The government is in discussions with AFD to fund the sewage management through a separate arrangement. The \nTA under the additional financing will support development of sanitation plans, including septage management. \n11  The additional financing was included in ADB. 2017. Country Operations Business Plan: Sri Lanka, 2017\u20132019. \nManila. \n12 The current project is financing the water supply networks and the additional financing will finance the desalination \nplant. Construction needs to be coordinated, especially pipe laying that needs to be done closer to desalination plant \ncompletion, to ensure integrity of the pipes. \n ", "3 \n7.  Additional  financing  and  eligibility  criteria.  Taking  into  account  the  proposed \nrestructuring, the project meets the eligibility criteria for additional financing.13 The overall project \n(i) remains technically feasible, economically viable, and financially sound; (ii) is accorded high \npriority by the government; (iii) is consistent with the current project\u2019s development objectives; \nand  (iv)  is  consistent with  the  country  partnership  strategy,  which  prioritizes  inclusive  and \nsustainable economic growth, including providing drinking water in the post-conflict area.14 \n \n8.  The project\u2019s value addition. Through the development and efficient management of a \ndesalination plant, the project will preserve groundwater and enhance drinking water quality, and \nprovide access to piped water supply for 300,000 people. It will benefit 12,000 households below \nthe poverty line, and empower women by eliminating drudgery associated with fetching water \nfrom distant sources. By increasing access to good-quality pressurized water, the project will help \nimprove local economic development and the environment in the post-conflict area. The project \nwill introduce and implement a DBO contract covering (i) the design and construction of a high-\nquality desalination plant, and (ii) efficient operation and maintenance (O&M) of the assets \nthrough a performance-based contract of 7 years. The DBO contract will give adequate time for \nthe National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) to build its capacity to operate assets \nbefore the end of the O&M contract period. The project will introduce high technology and climate \nresilience  through  the  desalination  plant,  which  will  employ  complex  reverse  osmosis  and \nadvanced computer control systems. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be improved health and human development in urban areas of the Jaffna \nPeninsula aligned with the government strategy.15 The outcome will be improved access to safe \ndrinking water in targeted urban areas of the Jaffna Peninsula. The original and aggregate targets \nare in the revised design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n \nC.  Outputs \n10.  The project supports the restructuring of the current project. It will (i) finance the cost \noverrun under the current project, and (ii) support the additional components of the desalination \nplant and related works under output 1 and water resource management plan under output 3. The \noverall project has the following three outputs (paras. 11\u201313).  \n \n11.  Output 1: Water supply infrastructure and service in the Jaffna Peninsula improved. \nThe overall project will (i) install a desalination plant of 24,000 m3 per day capacity, (ii) install 700 \nkilometers  of  water  mains  and  distribution  pipes,  (iii)  install  60,000  metered  new  water \nconnections, and (iv) operate and maintain the desalination plant for 5 years. The desalination \nplant will be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained by a single contractor using a \nperformance-based DBO contract. The O&M period under the DBO contract will be 7 years, of \nwhich 5 years will be covered by the project and the remaining 2 years will be financed by the \ngovernment. The overall project will support the monitoring and independent review of the \ndesalination plant services and the DBO contractor performance. The DBO contractor will ensure \n(i)  proper  bulk  water  metering,  (ii)  adequate  water  pressure  at  the  turning  point,  and  (iii) \ncompliance of supplied water with national quality standards for drinking water. The NWSDB will \nmanage the water transfer and distribution systems and ensure timely payments of fixed and \n                                                \n13 ADB. 2010.

The DBO contractor will train the \nNWSDB staff in operating the assets during the O&M period and will turn over the desalination \nplant to the NWSDB at the end of 7 years. The NWSDB has committed to the continuity of O&M \nof the desalination plant beyond the contract period. \n \n12.  Output 2: Headworks at Iranamadu Tank improved. The overall project will support \nenhancement and strengthening of headworks at Iranamadu Tank to increase its water storage \ncapacity from 131.4 million m3 to 148.0 million m3. Iranamadu Tank remains an important drinking \nwater resource for Jaffna, especially when the demand for drinking water is expected to increase \nsignificantly in the future. This output is expected to be completed by the end of 2017 under the \ncurrent project by the Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Council as the executing \nagency; it will not be covered by the additional financing.  \n \n13.  Output 3: Water resource management systems and capacity strengthened. The \noverall project will support long-term water resource management and capacity building of the \nNWSDB. This output will include (i) developing a detailed action plan for groundwater and surface \nwater monitoring and rehabilitation in Jaffna; (ii) conducting awareness campaigns on water \nconservation  and  water  sharing  from  Iranamadu  Tank;  (iii)  completing  a  water  resources \nmanagement  plan  for  Iranamadu  Tank;  and  (iv)  undertaking  community  development  in \nVadamarachchi village, where the desalination plant will be located. Capacity development will \nalso be carried out under the attached transaction TA as described in para. 18. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n14.

Based on \nthat, among several alternatives, the desalination plant\u2019s location in Thalayadi is based on the \nfollowing factors: (i) ideal seabed and seawater conditions; (ii) lower and consistent salinity level \nin the ocean for seawater intake; (iii) limited human activities; (iv) limited adverse environmental, \necological, and social impacts; and (v) the clean water transfer mains are aligned with the future \nwater supply route. The seawater intake will be piped to the sea due to the large plant capacity \nand to protect the groundwater aquifer. The reverse osmosis process was considered after a \nmarket survey revealed availability of the robust technology at a competitive price, which helps \nreduce the life cycle costs, achieve O&M cost savings, and maximize benefits. The bidding \ndocuments of the performance-based DBO contract were carefully developed to attract qualified \n                                                \n18 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \ninternational  bidders. 19  During  project  implementation,  the  NWSDB  will  recruit  project \nmanagement consultants to monitor the construction and services undertaken by the DBO \ncontractor. The NWSDB will recruit an independent performance monitoring and review entity to \nreview the contractor\u2019s performance and its employer obligations over the O&M period. With \ngovernment support, the NWSDB will recover O&M costs through tariffs to ensure sustainable \nservice delivery and optimal maintenance of the assets. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial  \n20.  Economic analysis. Economic analysis was conducted for the overall project.20 The \neconomic rationale for the government\u2019s intervention is sound, as the overall project aims to \nprovide stronger and more sustainable basic urban services in the Jaffna Peninsula, one of the \nareas worst affected by the civil war. The economic internal rate of return is estimated at 12.0%, \nindicating sufficient economic return compared to the economic opportunity cost of capital of \n9.0%. The results of the sensitivity analysis are satisfactory, except in cases where benefits are \ndecreased by 20% and all downside risks are combined, i.e., (i) a capital cost overrun of 20%, (ii) \nan overrun in O&M costs of 20%, and (iii) a 1-year delay in the start of operation. \n \n21.  Financial analysis. Financial analysis was undertaken to assess the financial viability of \nthe overall project.21 The financial internal rate of return is estimated at 2.9%, higher than the \nweighted average cost of capital of 2.7%. The results of the sensitivity analysis indicate that the \noverall project is sensitive to changes in parameters such as increase in capital costs, reduction \nin revenue, and a 1-year delay in implementation. The National Drinking Water Policy, 2002 states \nthat the water tariff should be adjusted regularly to cover the capital and O&M costs. 22 Financial \nanalysis indicated that the NWSDB would have sufficient income to cover its costs through \nimplementation of this policy. However, water tariff adjustment is a sensitive issue and may not \nalways be implemented in time, which could lead to a revenue deficit for the NWSDB. In such an \neventuality, the government would take actions to ensure that the NWSDB remains financially \nsustainable through a combination of partial tariff adjustments and budget support.23 ADB will \nprovide continued policy advice and capacity development support to facilitate the NSWDB\u2019s \nfinancial sustainability. \n \nC.  Governance \n22.  Governance and financial management. The NWSDB was established in 1975 as a \nstatutory entity and has been functioning under the supervision of the Ministry of City Planning \nand Water Supply. NWSDB\u2019s mandate is to develop, operate, and control an efficient, coordinated \nwater supply system and to distribute water for public, domestic, and industrial purposes. During \nthe project implementation, Jaffna Municipal Council and the Ministry of Local Government and \nProvincial Council will be consulted. An assessment concluded the financial management risk is \nmoderate with deficiencies in the fragmented accounting system and a need to strengthen the \n                                                \n19 Desalination Plant and DBO Package (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Government of Sri Lanka, NWSDB. 2002. National Drinking Water Policy. \nhttp://waterboard.lk/web/images/contents/organization/policies/national_drinking_water_policy.pdf. \n23 The NWSDB implements a progressive water tariff policy, which means uniform tariffs on a nationwide basis. This \nwill allow the project capital and O&M costs to be spread across all customers. To ensure the NWSDB\u2019s financial \nsustainability, the government has taken the following steps: (i) waived the NWSDB\u2019s loans from the government in \n2014; (ii) re-lent the additional financing loan to the NWSDB, with the loan portion being 15% and a grant covering \nthe remaining amount: (iii) will issue approval allowing the NWSDB to increase water tariff by 35% in 2017; and (iv) \nwill establish an independent regulator who will decide water tariffs. \n ", "8 \nnumber of auditing staff in the NWSDB. 24  NWSDB is familiarizing itself with ADB\u2019s disbursement \nprocedures and gaining knowledge through prior and ongoing experience in implementing ADB \nprojects. The risk mitigation measures include (i) strengthening the NWSDB\u2019s internal audit \ndivision to conduct timely audits by recruiting qualified staff to fill the existing vacancies; (ii) \ncontinuing policy dialogue with the government for approval of regular tariff adjustment and \nestablishment of an independent regulator for water tariffs; (iii) extending training and capacity \nbuilding support for the accounting staff of the NWSDB; and (iv) updating and improving the \naccounting system. The project will support the strengthening of the financial management \ncapacity of the NWSDB. \n \n23.  Procurement. The PMCIU has experience in procurement in accordance with ADB \nrequirements and has a satisfactory track record. Transparency in procurement will be ensured \nwith help of a website to disclose project information and thereby reduce corruption risk and \nimprove governance. ADB will continue to provide consultants for technical inputs to assist the \nNWSDB.  The  government  established  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  to  address  any \nprocurement issues. \n \n24.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the government. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 16). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n25.  The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. While Sri Lanka has a good \ntrack record in gender equality, many women suffer from poor water supply, sanitation, and other \nurban services, particularly in post-conflict areas. Limited access to safe drinking water requires \nfamily members, primarily women and girls, to spend considerable time and effort for fetching \nwater. The current project has made satisfactory progress on several indicators of the gender \naction plan.25 The additional financing will support the current project in providing safe drinking \nwater to 300,000 people (about 50% of whom are women). The gender action plan has been \nupdated to ensure that the inclusive and participatory approach will be followed to address the \nneeds of women and socially marginalized groups.26 The additional financing will cover costs for \nimplementation and monitoring of the strengthened gender action plan. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n26.  Social safeguards. The project is classified as category B for involuntary resettlement. It \ndoes not involve any land acquisition, physical or economic displacement, and/or loss of assets \nfor private individuals. All works will be undertaken on public lands or existing rights-of-way.27 The \nproject will not have any significant impacts on the fishing activities in this area. The PMCIU will \nundertake continuous monitoring and in case of any unanticipated livelihood impacts (particularly \non local fishers during the laying of the intake and outfall pipes in the sea for the desalination \nplant), the resettlement plan will provide remedial actions to be undertaken.28 The project-\n                                                \n24 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 These relate to women\u2019s involvement during the consultation on the water supply design, construction, and O&M; \ngender sensitization for project staff and stakeholders; an inclusive water management committee at the district level; \nand collection of sex-disaggregated data. \n26 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 The NWSDB signed a memorandum of understanding with the Thalayadi Fishermen\u2019s Cooperative Society and the \nThalayadi Rural Development Society agreeing on the project location. \n28 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nimpacted area in the sea (where intake and outfall pipes will be laid) is only used by fishers as a \ntransit passage with no fishing operations. The environmental management plan (EMP) contains \nprovisions to ensure the contractor provides requisite clear passage for fishing boats during the \npipe laying in the sea. The PMCIU conducted 31 public consultations with stakeholders, including \nfishing communities in the project area. More consultations are planned as per the community \naction and participation plan,29 which will be overseen by the PMCIU\u2019s sociologist. Resources \nhave been allocated from the current project to improve infrastructure and living conditions of the \nlocal fishers, including livelihood development, water supply, and toilets for the poor, as well as \nthe  construction  of  local  roads.  The  PMCIU  has  dedicated  staff for  monitoring  social  and \nresettlement issues, and will submit social safeguards monitoring reports to ADB for review and \ndisclosure on a semiannual basis.  \n \n27.  Environmental safeguards. The project is classified as category A for environment \nbecause it involves construction and operation of a large desalination plant at a coastal site. A full \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) including an EMP was prepared and disclosed on ADB\u2019s \nwebsite on 17 July 2017.30 Mitigation measures are proposed in the EMP to minimize habitat and \nspecies disturbance during construction and operation of the desalination plant and associated \nfacilities. Implementation of a biodiversity management plan in the EMP will ensure no net loss of \nbiodiversity. Public consultations were conducted with local communities, government authorities, \nand nongovernment organizations, and their feedback was considered in the project design. \nEnvironmental  clearance  from  the  Central  Environment  Authority  (CEA)  was  obtained  and \nprovisions in the clearance were incorporated in the EMP and environmental monitoring program. \nPublic concerns were identified in the EIA, and mitigation measures were incorporated into the \nEMP. A grievance redress mechanism was established, and the project will ensure that the \nmembers of the grievance redress committee, the PMCIU, and contractors are provided with \ntrainings to address project-related grievances. The PMCIU has dedicated staff for monitoring \nenvironmental issues and implementing the EMP. The PMCIU will retain independent advisory \nexperts to monitor the implementation of the project\u2019s EMP in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009) (SPS) and the CEA policy. \n \n28.  The NWSDB has implemented several ADB projects and has adequate institutional \ncapacity and experience to manage safeguard risks. The EMP will be incorporated into civil works \ncontracts, giving contractors the primary responsibility for implementation. The NWSDB will \nprovide  environmental  monitoring  reports  to  ADB  quarterly  during  construction  works  and \nsemiannually during operation. A corrective action plan will be prepared and implemented for any \nnoncompliance  issues.  The  contractors  and  NWSDB  will  adhere  to  the  SPS  and  national \nenvironmental regulations. In the event of any unanticipated environmental impacts during project \nimplementation, the NWSDB will address them by updating the EIA and revising the EMP, which \nwill be disclosed on the ADB website. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n29.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.31 Intended benefits are expected to outweigh \ncosts. \n \n \n                                                \n29 The community action and participation plan is included in the PAM (footnote 16). \n30 Environmental Impact Assessment Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLack of sustained support from fishing  Public consultations have been held.

The government and the NWSDB have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. The government and the NWSDB have agreed with ADB on \ncertain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n31.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve: \n(i)  the loan of $95,000,000 to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the \nadditional financing of the Jaffna and Kilinochchi Water Supply Project, from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with interest to be determined \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility; for a term of 30 years, including a grace period of 7 years; and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft loan and project agreements presented to the Board; and \n(ii)  the loan of $25,000,000 to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the \nadditional financing of the Jaffna and Kilinochchi Water Supply Project, from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in concessional terms, with an interest charge \nat the rate of 2% per year during the grace period and thereafter; for a term of 25 \nyears, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as \nare substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project \nagreements presented to the Board.   \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n7 November 2017 \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the Project is Aligned with \nCurrent project \nHealth and human development in urban areas of Jaffna Peninsula improved (Vision for a New Sri Lanka)a \nOverall project \nUnchanged \nResults Chain  Performance Indicators with  Data Sources and  Risks \nTargets and Baselines  Reporting \nOutcome  Current project     \nCurrent project   By 2017     \n       \nNational, provincial, \nImproved water supply  a.
