I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed equity \ninvestment of up to $40,000,000 in the Olympus Capital Asia V, L.P. Fund.1  \n \nII.  THE FUND \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n2.  Description. Olympus Capital Asia V, L.P. Fund, a Cayman Islands exempted limited \npartnership, is a close-ended private equity fund with a target capitalization of $750 million, which \nwill invest in middle-market companies across the agribusiness and food, financial and business \nservices, and environmental sectors in Asia.2 The general partner (GP) will be Olympus Capital \nAsia V GP, L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership. The Fund will have an \ninvestment management agreement with Olympus Capital Holdings Asia, a Cayman Islands \ncompany and a registered investment advisor with the United States Securities and Exchange \nCommission.3 \n \n3.  Investment identification. As part of its ongoing market mapping exercise of attractive \nprivate equity fund investment opportunities within ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs), \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) identified Olympus Capital as one of the leading private \nequity firms investing in middle-market companies in Asia. In October 2013, ADB initiated \ndialogue with Olympus Capital and over the subsequent months followed the firm\u2019s platform with \nincreasing interest since Olympus Capital operates in several verticals that align with ADB\u2019s \nmandate, and follows a specialized multi-sector investment strategy not commonly found among \nother middle-market private equity funds, which typically have a country-specific or generalist \napproach. ADB was also attracted to Olympus Capital\u2019s significant record of generating attractive \nco-investment opportunities for its limited partners, particularly in underserved sectors that ADB \nis keen to support, such as agribusiness and financial services. \n   \n4.  Based on the screening process of funds operating in the firm\u2019s three core verticals, ADB \nranked  Olympus  Capital  very  highly,  with  significant  competitive  advantage  over  its  direct \ncompetitors in terms of performance record, regional reach (including a sizeable regional platform \nwith local teams), sector experience, access to direct proprietary deal flow, and investor base. \nConsequently, ADB considers the fund to be a high-quality investment opportunity for ADB\u2019s \nprivate equity portfolio.4  \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n5.  The fund\u2019s three core sectors (agribusiness and food, financial and business services, and \nenvironmental sectors) represent attractive areas for middle-market private equity investment in \nAsia since they continue to benefit from the rise in domestic consumption, particularly the shift to \nhigher quality food and services; a growing middle class driving greater focus on food safety and \n \n1  Design and Monitoring Framework (included in Appendix 1). \n2  A middle market company is defined broadly as having between $100 million and $1 billion in annual revenues. While \nthe range is broad, the firm\u2019s legacy investments in the PRC, India, and Southeast Asia have been at the lower end \nof this range, with annual revenues between $100 million and $300 million. \n3  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n4  ADB will be investing in another Olympus Capital sponsored fund, Asia Environmental Partners II L.P. (AEP II), which \nis subject to board approval on 14 November 2014. AEP II is a separate environmental focused fund of Olympus \nCapital with a $300 million target commitment. \n \n \n ", "2    \n \naccess to clean air and water; structural imbalances in the supply chain and supply\u2013demand for \ncapital;  and  government  and  regulatory  policies  favorably  disposed  to  seeing  growth  and \nimprovement in these sectors.5 Olympus Capital will target Asian middle-market companies that \nbenefit from a combination of these macroeconomic trends, including agribusiness and food \ncompanies that improve the availability of and access to safe, quality food; financial intermediaries \nthat provide business services and capital for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and \nconsumers; and environmental services and clean energy companies that support environmental \nsustainability. \n \n6.  The fund intends to invest in a balanced portfolio of 10\u201315 established and growing \nmiddle-market  growth  companies,  with  a  focus  on  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC), \nSoutheast Asia, India, as well as Japan and the Republic of Korea.6 The average investment size \nwill generally be between $50 million and $75 million each. Specified target segments will include \nthe following: (i) for the agribusiness and food vertical, the upstream through midstream areas of \nthe agriculture value chain; (ii) for the financial and business services vertical, consumer finance, \nstructured credit, leasing and mortgages; and (iii) for the environmental vertical, renewable energy \nprojects, natural gas development and distribution, waste management, and energy efficiency \nprojects and services. The fund will generally focus on providing growth capital to established \nmiddle-market companies on the verge of entering the next phase of growth. Olympus Capital will \nseek to become the largest shareholder or the largest outside shareholder alongside the investee \ncompany founder(s). The firm targets these control-oriented investments so that it can take an \nactive management role in the portfolio company and implement value creating initiatives.  \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n1.  Ownership \n7.  The fund is a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership that will comprise strategic \ninvestors, foundations, family offices, and other institutional investors. The Cayman Islands has \nbeen categorized largely compliant with internationally agreed tax standards in the latest progress \nreport prepared by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s Global Forum \non Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes.7 ADB\u2019s review of the fund does \nnot give ADB cause to believe that it has been established, or is being used for cross-border tax \nevasion, money laundering, or terrorism financing in the jurisdictions involved in the investment \n(footnote 1). \n   \n2.  Management \n8.  The fund is sponsored by Olympus Capital, a leading independent private equity firm that \nhas been investing in middle-market companies across Asia for over 17 years. [This information \nhas been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n \n5  Sector Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6  Investments in ADB\u2019s non-DMCs will be capped at 20% of the fund\u2019s aggregate commitments and must demonstrate \nsubstantial economic linkage with ADB\u2019s DMCs. In case an investment does not qualify as having substantial \neconomic linkage, ADB will have the right to opt out of the investment. \n7  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. 2013. Tax Transparency 2013 Report on Progress. Paris. \nOther jurisdictions categorized largely compliant include Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the \nUnited States. ", "  3 \n \n \n \n9.  Olympus Capital is led by a stable, senior investment team of eight highly experienced \nmanaging directors (including the three founders), who have an average tenure of 14 years with \nthe firm.8 The investment teams of the firm are organized by industry vertical, with two managing \ndirectors responsible for co-leading the firm\u2019s efforts in each of the core sectors across Asia. The \ncore sector teams comprise managing directors, executive directors, and vice-presidents, while \nthe firm\u2019s analysts and associates generally work across sectors and markets. Olympus Capital\u2019s \nlocal teams throughout Asia allow it to execute deal sourcing and development, due diligence, \nand post-investment business plans on a local level. This provides significant benefits, particularly \nwithin the middle market, where local relationships and expertise are critical. \n \n3.  Governance Structure \n10.  The general partner will follow a typical three-stage investment process based on an \napproach developed and refined through its 17 years of investing in middle-market companies in \nAsia: (i) investment screening of each potential portfolio company\u2019s operations, products, market \nopportunity, and valuation against the fund\u2019s mandate and strategy; (ii) deal structuring and due \ndiligence; and (iii) preparation of investment proposals for presentation to the fund\u2019s investment \ncommittee.  \n \n11.

[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].9 \n  \n13.  As an investment advisor registered with the United States Securities and Exchange \nCommission, Olympus Capital is required to comply fully with its provisions for combatting money \nlaundering, the financing of terrorism, and anticorruption. After reviewing Olympus Capital\u2019s \npolicies to screen for integrity risks and combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism, \nADB is satisfied that sufficient checks and screening measures are in place (footnote 1). ADB will \nrequire auditing of the implementation of such policies.  \n \nD.  Financial Performance \n14.

The Assistance \n15.  ADB will provide an equity investment of up to $40,000,000 in the fund, not to exceed 25% \nof the fund\u2019s total capital commitments and not resulting in ADB being the single largest investor \nin the fund. \n \n \n8  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n9  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n ", "4    \n \nB.

Exit Strategy  \n17.  The fund has a 10-year term from final closing, with two options to extend for a maximum \nof 1 year each. Olympus Capital anticipates that the principal exit strategies for the fund\u2019s \ninvestments will include both trade sales to strategic buyers, which have accounted for over 75% \nof the firm\u2019s realizations, as well as public offerings. Olympus Capital has developed a strong \ndiscipline  around  proactive  exit  planning,  including  spending  a  significant  amount  of  time \nconfirming alignment with management on the approach and timing of potential liquidity events, \nas well as structuring the investment with well-defined exit rights, including buyout options with \ncounterparties, pre-agreed and seniority treatment in recapitalizations, post-initial public offering \nsales and dividend payouts, and drag-along or tag-along rights to deliver 100% or at least majority \ncontrol to trade buyers. \n \n2.  Reporting Arrangements \n18.  The general partner will provide ADB with (i) quarterly unaudited reports; and (ii) audited \nannual reports, including financial statements, a fund overview, and an overview of the portfolio \nwith brief information on each portfolio company\u2019s performance and valuation. ADB will review \nthis information and will follow up with the general partner when more information or clarification \nis needed. If the information received from the general partner raises issues that could impair the \nvalue of ADB\u2019s investment in the fund, ADB will decide whether to put the fund on a watch list for \nmore frequent review and closer attention. \n \n19.  The general partner will be required to submit its environmental and social management \nsystem (ESMS) to ADB prior to its first disbursement and to report annually on environmental and \nsocial safeguards issues and development effectiveness indicators. ADB will monitor the receipt \nand quality of the ESMS reports and offer guidance should the general partner require clarification \non ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements. \n \nD.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n20.  Capital mobilization. Given ADB\u2019s presence and reputation in Asia, ADB\u2019s participation \nas an anchor investor in the fund is expected to have a strong signaling effect\u2014validating the \nenvironmental and social governance framework and development impact against a backdrop of \nstrong financial returns\u2014and is a prime example of ADB\u2019s Finance ++ concept of leveraging the \ninstitution\u2019s reputation and capital to mobilize third-party investment activity in its DMCs. ADB\u2019s \ninvestment is expected to mobilize up to $75 million in additional commitments from Asian \ninstitutional investors, as well as a similar amount from co-investors in the fund\u2019s portfolio \ncompanies.  \n \n \n10  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. ", "  5 \n \n \n \n21.  Raising standards. ADB\u2019s presence as an anchor investor in the fund obligates the \ngeneral partner to ensure that its investee companies comply with environment and social \nsafeguard standards, and to report on development indicators. ADB\u2019s role, along with other \nmembers of the fund\u2019s advisory committee, will be to assist in providing oversight on important \ngovernance matters that are critical for companies to demonstrate as they seek additional sources \nof growth capital from institutional and/or individual investors. \n \nE.

DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome and Outputs \n1.  Impact \n26.  The impact is increased private equity funding in the Asian middle-market segment. The \nfund\u2019s success is expected to catalyze additional private equity funding, including for the middle-\nmarket segment, measured by the increase in private equity funding in Asia as a percentage of \nglobal private equity funding. \n \n2.  Outcome \n27.  The development outcome of the fund is to demonstrate positive social and financial \nreturns through the private equity modality. At the conclusion of this project, the fund is envisaged \nto exit 100% of its investment portfolio at a minimum net IRR of 8%, with at least 75% of the \ninvestee companies demonstrating some measurable improvement in the availability of and \naccess to safe and high-quality food; availability of capital to SMEs in urban and rural areas; or \nenvironmental sustainability (as a result of Olympus Capital\u2019s value addition). The fund also \nexpects to improve the corporate governance and transparency of its investee companies, \nwherever possible, and to contribute to overall (i.e., net) job creation and tax contributions. \n \n3.  Outputs \n28.  The primary output is the establishment of a private equity fund focused on the middle-\nincome  segment  within  the  food  and  agribusiness,  financial  and  business  services,  and \nenvironmental sectors in Asia that mobilizes capital from a diversified base of Asian and western \ninstitutional and strategic investors. The fund will be considered successful if it achieves an initial \nclosing by the first quarter of 2015, commences fund operations within 6 months of establishment, \n ", "6    \n \nand deploys its capital within the 5-year proposed investment period from the fund\u2019s final closing \ndate. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020  \n29.  In 2014, ADB completed the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, which aimed to help the \norganization prepare for the challenges of transforming the Asia and Pacific region. This fund is \nconsistent with the review\u2019s emphasis that ADB prioritize support for inclusive sectors and \nenvironmentally sustainable projects.11 Specifically, through investments in agriculture products \nthat improve food security in Asia, the fund increases the availability of and access to quality food. \nThe fund also supports financial sector development and the deepening of the financial sector by \nincreasing the capacity of financial intermediaries to expand lending to SMEs and consumers, \nwhich is essential to ensuring sustainable private sector-led growth. Finally, the fund supports \nADB\u2019s climate change mandate by participating in clean energy investments.   \n  \n2.  Consistency with Sector Strategy  \n30.  The fund\u2019s investment themes align well with ADB\u2019s agriculture, energy sector, and \nfinancial sector strategies. In particular, its investments in agriculture inputs and technologies \nsupport ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Sustainable Food Security, which recommends an expanded \npartnership with the private sector to attract more direct investments in productivity enhancement, \nagro-processing, agro-retailing, and other nonfarm rural business.12  In addition, the fund\u2019s clean \nenergy projects are consistent with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy,13 which seeks to facilitate a transition \nto a low-carbon economy and universal access to energy so as to help DMCs obtain reliable, \nadequate, and affordable energy for inclusive growth, and ADB\u2019s Urban Operational Plan, which \naims to promote more sustainable urban development through increased investments in water \nsupply, wastewater, solid waste, and energy efficiency.14 Further, the fund\u2019s investments in \nfinancial  intermediaries  are  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  financial  sector  operational  plan,  which \nhighlights the importance of support for SME access to finance as part of financial sector \ndevelopment, and the need to support the three key pillars of the real economy: households, \nSMEs, and infrastructure.15    \n \n3.  Consistency with Country Strategy \n31.  Interventions in ADB\u2019s DMCs will be aligned with the relevant country strategies, including \nthose of the PRC, India, Indonesia, Viet Nam, the Philippines, and Thailand, which consistently \nemphasize  private  sector  development,  sustainable  growth,  climate  change  mitigation  and \nadaptation, and clean energy as core themes. \n \n4.  Lessons from Previous Operations \n32.

POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions   \n33.  The fund will be required to comply with the applicable national laws and regulations, as \nwell as ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS, 2009). Under the SPS, an ESMS has to be \nestablished and implemented commensurate with the impacts and risks of its operations and \nthose of its portfolio companies. The fund and its investee companies will comply with the \napplicable laws and regulations on environment and health and safety, and it will not invest in any \nportfolio company that conducts or is involved in any activity on ADB\u2019s prohibited investment \nactivities list.16 Subprojects will be screened for risks and verified during due diligence. The fund\u2019s \nESMS will include provisions requiring the fund and its portfolio companies to comply with national \nlabor laws and to take measures in relation to internationally recognized core labor standards, in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s social protection strategy.17 The project is categorized as having no \ngender elements. \n \n34.  Already identified pipeline opportunities for the fund include potential investments in a beef \nprocessing company, coffee manufacturing, business process outsourcing service solutions, and \nequipment leasing services. Each of these investments has its own occupational health and safety \nhazards, which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to recognized international guidelines, \nbest practices, and design criteria. The majority of the fund\u2019s portfolio investments are likely to be \nclassified category B or C. However, some environmental investments may be classified category \nA (e.g., involving irreversible impact on the project\u2019s site biodiversity), for which SPS requirements \nfor category A projects will be followed. Additional requirements may be set for category B portfolio \ninvestments  in  case  significant  gaps  exist  between  SPS  requirements  and  host  country \nregulations.  \n \n35.  On  social  safeguards,  the  investment  in  the  fund  is  classified  FI  for  environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples under ADB\u2019s SPS. While the majority of the \nfund\u2019s investments are unlikely to involve involuntary resettlement or indigenous peoples impacts, \nsuch impacts are possible in some cases. These will be subject to the screening, due diligence, \nand remedial action processes set out in the ESMS and fund documentation, which include \ncompulsory referral of all investments categorized A for any impact to an environmental and social \nsubcommittee, on which ADB will have the right to participate. In addition, ADB will seek to \nnegotiate with the general partner the right to opt out of, on a case-by-case basis, proposed fund \ninvestments categorized A or B for involuntary resettlement or indigenous peoples impacts. \n \n36.  The fund will have an ESMS in place that complies with the SPS and details the policy, \nprocedures, and workflow that will be followed for investments made by the fund. The ESMS will \nbe an integral part of the fund\u2019s investment process and will provide guidelines at the portfolio, \ncompany, and fund level, while requiring the fund to submit to ADB an annual environmental and \nsocial performance report documenting the continued compliance of its investee companies with \nADB\u2019s  environmental  and  social  performance  standards.  The  fund  will  hire  a  dedicated \nenvironmental management specialist with specific responsibilities in this area. \n \n \n16  ADB\u2019s Prohibited Investment Activities List is in the Safeguard Policy Statement, Appendix 5. \n17  ADB. 2001.
