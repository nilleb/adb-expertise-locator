It will improve\ngovernance,  transparency,  and  accountability  in  the  corporate  and\nfinancial sector by (i) upgrading the legal and regulatory framework,\nstandards,  and  policies;  (ii)  strengthening  key  sector  institutions\ninvolved  in  corporate  and  financial  governance;  (iii)  strengthening\ninstitutions  for  improved  drafting  and  enforcement  of  laws  and\nregulations;  (iv)  creating  an  enabling  environment  for  upgrading\npayment  systems  and  information  and  communication  technology\n(ICT) infrastructure for financial service delivery; and (v) preparing for\nthe restructuring and development of selected financial intermediaries.\nClassification Economic growth\nEnvironmental Category C\nAssessment The environmental implications of the Project are minimal.\nRationale To  escape  the  poverty  trap,  Nepal  must  increase  its  average  per\ncapita  annual  growth  rate  in  a  sustainable  manner  to  at  least  5\npercent, with equitable distribution. This requires, among others, an\nefficient  financial  system  to  support  real  sector  growth  and\nemployment generation. Unfortunately, Nepal\u2019s financial system has\nnot  been  in  a  position  to  fulfill  its  supportive  role  because  of\ndeficiencies in the basic foundations in the system.\nThe fundamental requirements of an efficient financial system are a\nsound  policy,  legal,  and  regulatory  environment  with  adequate\ninstitutions and effective enforcement. An efficient financial system\nalso calls for access to reliable information that is disclosed in a timely\nand transparent manner, responsible market participants with proper\naccountability structures, and a technological infrastructure to reduce\ntransaction costs. In short, an efficient financial system requires good\ncorporate and financial governance with adequate ICT support. It must\nbe in place before more sophisticated markets and services can be\ndeveloped,  and  if  financial  institutions  are  to  be  successfully\nrestructured.\nObjectives and The long-term goal of the Project is to contribute to a higher and more\nScope equitably distributed economic growth through a robust and efficient\nfinancial  sector  characterized  by  transparency,  accountability,  and\nbasic  infrastructure.  The  results  will  be  increased  competition  and\nbetter services, coupled with reduced transaction costs in financial\nintermediation. The Project is part of a multidimensional and longer\nterm reform process to achieve that goal.", "ii\nMore specifically, the Project\u2019s objective is to improve transparency,\naccountability and basic financial sector infrastructure comprising (i) a\nlegal  and  regulatory  framework,  accounting  standards  and  sector\npolicies; (ii) key sector regulatory and supervisory institutions; (iii) a\nlegal and judicial system with capacity for proper enforcement and\ndispute  resolution;  and  (iv)  environment  for  ICT  infrastructure  for\npayments, disclosing information, and delivering financial services. In\naddition,  the  Project  will  initiate  work  to  restructure  and  develop\nselected market participants to enable them to play a better role in the\nfinancial system. In covering these assistance areas, the Project takes\na holistic approach by seamlessly blending a number of loan and\ntechnical assistance (TA) grant-funded components. From a subsector\nperspective, the Project will focus on  governance in the corporate\nsector and in nonbank financial institutions, including rural finance and\ncapital markets.\nAt the end of the Project, key policy impediments should be removed\nand  Nepal  should  possess  a  basic  but  sound  regulatory  and\ninstitutional framework with improved enforcement capacity, and be\nprepared  for  introduction  of  ICT  and  further  reforms  to  support\ncontinuous growth of the financial and real sectors.\nCost Estimates The total cost of the Project is estimated at $13.3 million equivalent,\nincluding contingencies and taxes. The foreign exchange cost is $7.9\nmillion  (59  percent)  and  the  local  currency  cost  is  $5.4  million\nequivalent (41 percent).\n( $ million)\nFinancing Plan Source   Foreign Local Total Percent\n        Exchange Currency Cost\nADB Loan 5.1 2.2  7.3 54.9\nADB TA Grant 2.8 0.5 3.3   24.8\nGovernment  0.0 2.7 2.7 20.3\nTotal   7.9 5.4 13.3 100.0\nA loan of SDR 5.706 million in various currencies equivalent to $7.3\nmillion will be provided from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with a\nterm of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an\ninterest charge of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and\n1.5 percent per annum thereafter.\nPeriod of Utilization Until 30 June 2005\nExecuting Agency Ministry of Finance (MOF)\nImplementation MOF will administer the loan proceeds and coordinate and monitor the\nArrangements implementation  of  the  Project.  To  implement  the  loan-funded\ncomponents, MOF will coordinate with the (i) Securities Board, Nepal\nStock  Exchange,  and  Ministry  of  Industry  in  improving  corporate\ngovernance and capital markets; and (ii) Ministry of Law and Justice\nand  Supreme  Court  in  improving  legal  and  judicial  enforcement", "iii\nmechanisms  and  capacities.  In  addition,  MOF  will  coordinate  with\nvarious line ministries and agencies in implementing of the TA grant-\nfunded  components.  To  oversee  effective  coordination,  MOF  has\nestablish a project coordination and monitoring unit which will report to\na steering committee comprising private sector representatives, and\nwhich was established during the project formulation phase.\nProcurement Goods  and  services  will  be  procured  according  to  the  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement.  Supply  contracts  for  equipment  and\nmaterials will be awarded on an international competitive bidding basis\nfor  packages  with  over  $500,000  aggregate  value,  international\nshopping for packages costing over $100,000, and local competitive\nbidding or local shopping, in accordance with procedures acceptable\nto ADB, for other items, except minor items for which off-the-shelf\npurchases will be permitted. Any civil works financed under the loan\nwill be on a local competitive basis, as costs are less than $5 million.\nConsulting The loan will finance the provision of consulting services for policy\nServices advice,  institutional  development  and  training,  preparation  of  ICT\nsolutions,  and  project  management.  About  87  person-months  of\ninternational and 152 person-months of domestic consulting services\nwill  be  required.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants.\nTechnical Assistance The  Government  has  requested  an  umbrella  TA  with  six  sub-TAs\nunder ADB\u2019s cluster modality for a total amount of $3.3 million on a\ngrant basis from the ADB-funded TA Program. This will complement\nthe  loan-funded  components,  help  in  preparing  further  sector\ninterventions, assist in addressing key sector issues on an urgent\nbasis, and support the establishment of a conducive framework in a\nmore  strategic  and  comprehensive  way  than  would  a  single-TA\napproach. Specifically, the proposed TA cluster will comprise (i) TA 1:\nStreamlining  Financial,  Corporate,  and  Commercial  Legislation\n($250,000); (ii) TA 2: Improved Accounting and Auditing Standards in\nthe Public Sector ($250,000); (iii) TA 3: Institutional Strengthening of\nthe  Nepal  Rastra  Bank  for  Regulation  and  Supervision  of  Rural\nFinance ($800,000);  (iv) TA 4: Developing Nepal\u2019s Payment System\n($400,000); (v) TA 5: Financial and Operational Review of Agricultural\nDevelopment  Bank  of  Nepal  and  Nepal  Industrial  Development\nCorporation  ($850,000);  and  (vi)  TA  6:  Developing  of  Insurance,\nPensions, and Contractual Savings ($750,000).\nEstimated Project 31 December 2004\nCompletion Date\nProject Benefits The Project will reinforce the basic fundamentals for a robust and\nefficient financial sector. It will increase transparency, accountability,\nand better governance standards as well as law enforcement. More\nreliable financial information to the public will reduce the scope for\nrent-seeking  opportunities  of  individuals  through  a  monopoly  of", "iv\ninformation at the expense of the larger society. Access to information\nand justice is often excessively priced for the poorest segment of the\npopulation.    Initial  work  for  upgrading  the  payments  systems  and\ncreating  the  enabling  environment  for  development  of  ICT\ninfrastructure will promote competition and further growth in service\ndelivery. It will also include measures to prevent money laundering\nthrough Nepal\u2019s payment system.\nA  better  regulatory  and  institutional  framework  will  also  increase\nstability of the financial system and make it more robust against any\nfinancial crisis. This will reduce the risk of a negative socioeconomic\nimpact associated with a financial crisis, which is most severe for the\npoorest segment of the population.\nThe Project is part of a longer term development process for private\nand financial sector development. A computable general equilibrium\nmodel as well as international comparison with other reform countries\nindicates that comprehensive financial sector reform will boost Nepal\u2019s\nannual gross domestic product growth by about 2 percent \u2013 or $100\nmillion \u2013 per annum. Importantly, growth will be even stronger in rural\nareas as any ensuing investment will raise the demand for rural labor,\nespecially in the most labor-intensive activities.\n \n ", "I. THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on (i) a proposed\nloan to the Kingdom of Nepal for the Corporate and Financial Governance Project; and (ii)\nproposed technical assistance (TA) cluster for Corporate and Financial Governance Institutional\nSupport.\nII. INTRODUCTION\n2. Development of the financial and private sector is high on the policy agenda of His\nMajesty\u2019s Government of Nepal (HMGN). In response to this, the Asian Development Bank\n(ADB) country assistance plan for Nepal in 2000 includes the Project to improve governance in\nthe  corporate  and  financial  sector.  This  represents  an  initial  phase  of  a  long-term  reform\nprocess for sustainable financial and private sector development in Nepal.\n3. Formulation of the Project and policy dialogue were based on extensive economic sector\nwork by ADB and extensive stakeholder consultation from an early stage. A Reconnaissance\nMission visited Nepal in November 1998 and identified weak financial infrastructure - including\nlegal and regulatory framework, enforcement capacity, institutions, and technological support -\nas a major impediment to sustained private sector development. Subsequently, ADB conducted\na number of studies and workshops to further analyze key policy and institutional issues related\nto  nonbank  financial  intermediation.1  The  findings  suggest  that  addressing  corporate  and\nfinancial governance issues is key to sustainable financial and private sector development, and\nthat improving accounting standards and corporate legislation were of immediate priority.\n4. In response, ADB approved a capacity building TA for the accounting and auditing\nprofession and a TA for reform of company, insolvency and secured transactions legislation.2 To\naugment the analytical capacity of HMGN and assist in coordinating the complex reforms in the\nfinancial sector, ADB also approved a TA3 for a focal point for financial sector reform. Under this\nTA, a web site (www.neat.net.np) was established for information on the reform process and\ndiscussion among stakeholders and aid agencies. In January 2000, HMGN formed a steering\ncommittee,  with  private  sector  representation,  to  closely  interface  with  ADB  in  formulating\nfurther  assistance  and  the  proposed  Project.  Project  implementation  arrangements  were\nfinalized during a Fact-Finding Mission in April 2000 and an Appraisal Mission in September\n2000. Throughout the project design phase, ADB\u2019s project team4 coordinated closely with the\nWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as well as with the bilateral sources\nactively involved in the sector, such as Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) and\nDepartment for International Development (DFID).\n                  \n1  ADB\u2019s findings are summarized in five reports: (i) Capital Market Development II, 1998; (ii) Private Sector\nDevelopment Issues, 1999; (iii) Financial Sector Regulation and Governance in Nepal, 1999; (iv) Transparency and\nEnforcement in the Corporate Sector in Nepal, 1999; and (v) Information Technology Applications in the Financial\nService Sector in Nepal, 2000. Some of the findings were presented and discussed with a wide range of\nstakeholders from the public and private sector at two workshops: Corporate Governance and Financial Sector\nDevelopment, in September 1999; and Corporate and Financial Governance, in November 1999. The latter was\norganized at the initiative of the Nepalese legal profession through the Supreme Court Bar Association.\n2 TA 3356-NEP: Capacity Building for the Accounting and Auditing Profession, for $665,000, approved on 22\nDecember 1999; TA 3461-NEP: Company and Insolvency Law Reform, for $250,000, approved on 27 July 2000.\n3  TA 3371-NEP: Establishing a Focal Point for Financial Sector Reform, for $150,000, approved on 27 December\n1999.\n4  The core project team comprised W.

BACKGROUND\nA. Sector Context\n \n1. Macroeconomic and Poverty\n5. Nepal\u2019s  growth  experience  has  been  uneven  throughout  the  1990s,  with  overall\nperformance dominated by the agriculture sector.  Growth performance has been disappointing,\naveraging less than 5 percent per annum over the last decade. In FY2000, agriculture, which\naccounts for 41 percent of output and 76 percent of employment, grew at 5.0 percent. Industry\ngrew by 8.3 percent, while services expanded by 5.9 percent. Inflation has been brought under\ncontrol, falling from 12.7 percent in FY1999 to about 4 percent. Monetary policy has been\npassive, supporting the exchange rate peg with the Indian rupee, and is largely influenced by\nIndia. While treasury bill and deposit rates of 6 to 7 percent mean little real returns to these\ninstruments,  prime  lending  rates  remain  at  more  than  12  percent.  The  current  account  is\nshowing a slight deficit compared with the slight surplus of the previous year. Foreign exchange\nreserves  are  at  a  comfortable  level  covering  6.7  months  of  imports.  Even  though  the\nmacroeconomic situation is currently stable, the decline in new business activities does not\nbode well for future performance. Company registrations, capital investment, and employment\ngeneration by new firms have been declining over the past few years in all main industrial\nsectors. The decline in new business activities in manufacturing in particular is worrisome, given\nthe fact that manufacturing has traditionally been the most important industry subsector in\ngenerating new employment, ahead of tourism and services. Foreign direct investment, which is\nnot particularly encouraged by public policies, was only 0.6 percent of gross domestic product\n(GDP) in FY1999.5\n6. Policies promoting nonagricultural activities in rural areas have so far shown little impact\non  the  ground.  Industrial  activity  remains  heavily  concentrated  around  Kathmandu  and  the\nCentral Region where 52 percent of industrial establishments are located, as well the Eastern\nRegion which accounts for another 30 percent. Industrial activity falls away dramatically once one\nmoves west of Kathmandu, with the Far Western Region accounting for less than 2 percent.\nIndustrial activity is concentrated in a small number of powerful Nepali families who own and\ncontrol about 27 percent of total private sector assets in the country. In addition, a number of\nenterprises  remain  in  public  sector  hands  and  operate  at  very  low  efficiency.  Nepal\u2019s\nincremental capital output ratio (ICOR) stands around 5,6 showing lower investment efficiency\nthan in its South Asian neighbors which have an average ICOR of around 4. For widespread\nreduction of poverty, a key challenge facing Nepal is to address the long-standing constraints to\nhigher growth, particularly the efficiency and outreach of the financial sector.\n7. In 1996, about 42 percent of Nepal\u2019s population lived below the national poverty line of\nNRs4,404 ($64) per capita per annum, which is based on a minimum calorie intake, housing,\nand  other  nonfood  expenses.  This  figure  varies  widely  across  the  country.  While  only  23\npercent of the urban population did not have sufficient incomes to meet basic consumption\nneeds, 44 percent of the rural population fell below the standard. Geographically, the incidence\nof poverty in the Mid-Western and Far Western development regions greatly exceeded the\nnational average, as did the rate in the mountain districts. Taking a broader view of human\ndeprivation than the simple income measure, Nepal ranked 144th out of 174 countries in the\nUnited Nation Development Programme\u2019s (UNDP\u2019s) 1999 Human Development Report. The\n                  \n5  For a more comprehensive assessment of economic performance, see CER:NEP98023, January 1999.\n6 This means investment of 5 percent of GDP is required to generate 1 percent of additional GDP growth.", "3\npeople in the poorest regions of the country have the lowest access to education and basic\nhealth services, highest rates of infant mortality, and highest rates of child malnutrition. Poverty\nis also associated with lower access to productive inputs, which inhibits the poor\u2019s ability to\nbreak the cycle of poverty. Rural households in the lowest income quartile own a smaller\npercentage of the land they farm, are less likely to benefit from year-round irrigation for their\nland, and use less fertilizer than their better-off neighbors. Poor households tend to be located\nfurther from roads. Borrowing from formal financial institutions, including microcredit, makes up\na lower share of the poor\u2019s outstanding loans.\n2. Key Financial Sector Issues in Nepal\n8. Ongoing  financial  sector  reforms  since  the  1980s  have  not  yielded  significant\nimprovements in resource mobilization and allocating efficiency. Traditionally, financial sector\npolicies and institutions in Nepal were premised on these assumptions: (i) access to cheap\ninstitutional credit could break the low equilibrium trap and induce investment, (ii) informal credit\nagencies were exploitative and credits obtained from these sources were seldom used for\nproductive purposes, (iii) the government was required to intervene in the sector to ensure\nsufficient flow of rural credit, and (iv) commercial banks had a social responsibility to serve the\nrural clientele even if in some cases it meant incurring losses. As a result, the policy and\ninstitutional  framework  was  deliberately  designed  to  allow  considerable  government\nparticipation and control with limited competition. Reform initiatives undertaken in the past\ninclude easing of licensing policies, statutory requirements, foreign exchange exposure, and\ncash reserve ratios; liberalization of the interest rates; and introduction of various prudential and\nregulatory reforms. However, the past piecemeal approach has not succeeded in substantially\nextending access to the formal financial sector to rural people, much less to the rural poor. The\nreform measures were not embedded in a wider policy reform framework and financial sector\ndevelopment strategy, and as such were improperly sequenced. Importantly, they took place\nwithin a fragmented and nontransparent legal, regulatory, and institutional environment. It is\nwidely recognized that the financial sector, and the state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) in\nparticular, face many problems.\n9. Ambiguous Vision, Policies, and Strategies for Financial Sector Development. The\nGovernment has issued a number of statements emphasizing the need for financial sector\nreforms and development on market-based principles, most notably in the Ninth Five-Year Plan\n(para. 25); however, a subset of policies with contradictory objectives exist, which aim to\nachieve socially desirable activities in the financial sector. The sector continues to operate in a\npolicy  environment  where  (i)  Government  targeted  and  subsidized  interventions  override\ncompetitive and efficient financial intermediation, (ii) interest rate spread does not reflect the\nhigher transaction cost associated with rural credit, (iii) institutions have no effective control over\ntheir corporate strategy, and (iv) the opening of new urban branches of commercial banks is\nlinked to the opening of additional rural branches. The absence of competition and of a profit\nmotive in Government-mandated credit programs does not encourage lenders to fund projects\nthat will produce high growth for the economy. Instead, they spawn adverse selection and moral\nhazard problems with negative economic and social consequences.\n10. Dominant Government Role and Poor Governance. One striking feature in Nepal\u2019s\nfinancial sector is the extent to which the Government plays an active role. The Government\nowns key financial institutions - Rastriya Banijya Bank (RBB), Agricultural Development Bank of\nNepal  (ADBN),  Nepal  Industrial  Development  Corporation  (NIDC),  five  regional  rural\ndevelopment banks (RRDBs), a large share of the insurance industry, and, until recently, the\nNepal Bank Limited (NBL). The central bank (Nepal Rastra Bank, NRB) itself is involved directly", "4\nin several directed lending (development fund) schemes to the microenterprise sector and to\nsupport rural finance activities. NRB is also a shareholder in a number of financial institutions\nthat it is supposed to regulate and supervise, thus creating considerable conflict of interest and\nregulatory  arbitrage.  The  Government\u2019s  extensive  involvement  in  the  ownership  and\nmanagement of the financial sector has resulted in strong political influence and interference in\nall aspects of banking operations, and led to lax enforcement of auditing, provisioning, and\nreporting requirements. Moreover, there is concern over the lack of banking knowledge of many\nGovernment  nominees  to  the  boards  of  the  financial  institutions.  Government-owned\ninstitutions, especially those established under their own separate acts, further benefit unduly -\ncompared with their private sector competitors - from direct or indirect subsidies in the form of\nexplicit or assumed Government guarantees, and less stringent enforcement of tax collection.\n11. Poor Quality of Financial Information and Disincentives to Information Disclosure.\nOne of the most serious impediments to sustained growth of the private sector in Nepal is the\nweak accounting and financial reporting systems. Nepal lacks sound accounting and reporting\nstandards,  which  are  among  the  most  fundamental  prerequisites  for  commercial  activities.\nThere  are  no  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  in  the  country,  and  disclosure\nrequirements for both listed and unlisted companies are inadequate. The fact that foreign\naccountants are not allowed to operate in Nepal has undermined opportunities for technology\nand skills transfer in the sector. It is believed that many companies submit the required financial\ninformation with a few years delay, but insufficient supervision has allowed them to continue\noperating without much penalty. As information available to lenders is often incomplete or\nexpensive to establish, lending is based primarily on collateral and personal guarantees instead\nof  a  credit  analysis  relying  on  financial  statements  and  business  plans.  The  information\ndeficiency  has  resulted  in  misallocation  of  capital.  Increased  nonperforming  assets  in  the\nbanking sector and lack of investor confidence in the stock market have, in turn, increased the\ncost of capital for industries. The information gap also causes prudent lenders to restrict the\nprovision of financial services to low-risk clients, or to demand excessive collateral. Enhancing\nthe  role  of  the  Credit  Information  Bureau  (CIB)  to  share  information  on  borrowers\u2019\ncreditworthiness is being considered, but that requires broad-based participation of market\nplayers. In addition, poor reporting by financial institutions complicates adequate supervision\nand assessment of the financial sector health. Lending records within the institutions are usually\nmaintained in manual files and often are missing or incomplete. To help address the information\nproblem,  ADB  approved  in  December  1999  a  TA  to  assist  the  Institute  of  Chartered\nAccountants of Nepal (ICAN) to raise accounting and audit standards (footnote 2).\n12. Issues in Tax Administration. It is generally felt that Nepal\u2019s tax policies, particularly\nincome tax and customs and property-related taxes, have many deficiencies. They allow tax\nofficers to exercise discretionary powers, resulting in arbitrary tax assessment. It is widely\nbelieved that many companies maintain different books and accounts for different purposes,\nsuch as tax assessment and credit applications. Such practice has exacerbated the mistrust\nbetween  tax  collector  and  payers.  The  GTZ  has  initiated  a  comprehensive  program  to\nstrengthen income tax administration and registration of taxpayers in the main cities. The\nDanish International Development Assistance (Danida) has provided assistance for introducing\nthe  value-added  tax.  A  uniform  tax  identification  number  will  be  used  for  tax  purposes.\nImprovement in tax administration is particularly important in corporate governance as it is\nindispensable for accurate financial disclosure of business entities, and information needs to be\nreconciled in a systematic and transparent way.\n13. Fragmented and Inconsistent Legal and Regulatory Framework. Nepal\u2019s legal and\nregulatory environment is highly fragmented, inconsistent, and institution based rather than", "5\nfunction based. This is particularly true of lending activities, which are regulated by at least eight\nacts.7 The result is a segmented financial system with special privileges for government-owned\ninstitutions and regulatory arbitrage for unevenly supervised financial intermediaries, particularly\nin rural finance.8 The various acts governing the financial sector are not necessarily consistent\nand often conflict with commercial and corporate legislation, in particular the Companies Act.\nThis  causes  a  high  degree  of  nontransparency.  Laws,  rules,  and  regulations  allow  for\ndiscretionary interpretation and lead to excessively high business transaction costs and lower\nprivate sector competitiveness. While there is a need to streamline legislation, some important\nareas \u2013 such as bankruptcy, debt recovery, and secured transactions \u2013 are not yet adequately\ncovered and require legislation that meet the needs of the market economy. To assist in\naddressing some of the most urgent needs, ADB approved a TA for law reform (footnote 2) and\nthe World Bank initiated assistance to streamline banking sector legislation.\n14. Ineffective Legal Enforcement Mechanism. Notwithstanding the proliferation of laws\nand its associated problems, the country\u2019s judicial system has not been fully equipped to\nimplement  legislation  in  a  consistent  manner.  In  the  absence  of  a  commercial  court  or\nspecialized bench to deal with commercial matters, dispute resolution through the existing court\nsystem is usually a lengthy process. Judgments often are not made public or are inconsistent.\nWith assistance from the United States of America, the Government recently developed and\npassed a new Arbitration Act 1998, which is expected to address this issue. Good progress in\nimplementing the Act, however, remains to be seen. Improving the quality of legal professionals\nis another crucial issue in private sector development. Law application and enforcement are\nconstrained by lack of competent lawyers and judges, especially in commercial law. Legal\neducation and training are poor. Courts lack modern court administration techniques, and case\nmanagement by the judiciary or the courts is largely unknown. A recent United States Agency\nfor  International  Development  (USAID)  project  with  the  Supreme  Court  is  examining  the\nproblem  of  delay  in  courts  and  will  recommend  adoption  of  modern  case  management\ntechniques. The judiciary also suffers from severe funding constraints. The budget allocation of\nless than 0.5 percent of total expenditures is low and insufficient for the judiciary to effectively\nfulfill its role.\n15. Weak Institutional Capacity for Regulation and Supervision. While the Government\nplays a key role as an owner and operator within the financial system, effective supervisory and\nregulatory oversight functions that one would expect from a government vis \u00e0 vis the financial\nsector are largely missing. The key agencies entrusted with regulation and supervision are the\nNRB for banking and selected nonbank lending institutions, and the Securities Board (SEBO)\nfor  capital  market  activities  and  institutions.  Both  lack  a  clear  mandate  and  adequate\nenforcement powers and tools, and are constrained by a weak human resource base and\ninadequate  information  technology  (IT)  support.  Specifically,  the  capacity  of  the  NRB  for\nregulation and supervision is weakened because of (i) dependence on policy directives from the\nMinistry of Finance (MOF), (ii) inherent conflicts of interest through direct shareholding in state-\nowned financial institutions, and (iii) inconsistent legal and regulatory framework. Moreover,\nresponsibilities for regulating of rural finance activities are diffused as a result of the fragmented\nlegal framework. To improve governance and give a clearer mandate to SEBO, ADB has\n                  \n7  Nepal Rastra Bank Act, 1955; ADBN Act, 1967; NIDC Act, 1990; Commercial Bank Act, 1974; Developing Banks\nAct, 1996; Financial Companies Act, 1985; Cooperatives Act, 1992; Financial Intermediation Act, 1998.\n8  For example, some rural cooperative societies, which are allowed to collect savings from the general public, fall\nunder the purview of the central bank (NRB) under the Cooperatives Act, while others which cater only to members\nare supervised by the Ministry of Agriculture. Rural financial intermediaries such as credit unions will fall under the\nnewly legislated Financial Intermediation Act, and therefore are regulated and supervised indirectly by NRB\nthrough the Rural Finance Development Board.", "6\nassisted in reviewing and modernizing of a new Securities Act. IMF is providing assistance for a\nreview of the NRB Act.\n16. Financial Difficulties of State-Owned Financial Institutions. All state-owned financial\nintermediaries face financial difficulties, although the extent of the problems is difficult to assess\nin the absence of reliable financial information. The poor performance can be attributed to\ndeficiencies in governance, lack of commercial orientation and managerial skills, as well as\ninadequate policies. Financial record keeping and auditing are not of international standards.\nInternal monitoring, evaluation, and supervision are weak, as is the system of appraisal and\nfollow-up on loans. The problems are most acute for the two government-controlled commercial\nbanks, RBB and NBL, which dominate the banking system with about 70 percent of total assets.\nA recent international audit indicates that both banks suffer serious, critical shortfalls in all key\nareas, and that both are technically insolvent, with negative worth estimated at up to 7 percent\nof GDP. Although deposits are presumed to be implicitly guaranteed by the Government, a\nsystemic banking or fiscal crisis could emerge if problems remain unaddressed. World Bank\nassistance in this area has been requested.\n17. The specialized development finance institutions (DFIs) - ADBN and NIDC - account for\nabout 8 percent of financial sector assets, but are widely believed to be in bad shape as well.\nPrudential regulations such as for loss provisioning are more relaxed than those for commercial\nbanks,  and  their  financial  statements  may  give  an  incorrect  picture  of  their  true  financial\nperformance and condition. Loan recovery rates for some programs are estimated at below 60\npercent.  While  the  DFIs  had  traditionally  emphasized  lending  based  on  credit  lines  by\ninternational aid agencies, recently they started mobilizing deposits, as their traditional funding\nsources have dried up. A major problem of the DFIs has been their diffused focus. ADBN\nincludes  promotion  of  biogas,  rural  electrification,  small  irrigation  development,  and  solar\nenergy. While these activities appear interesting from a development perspective, there exists\nlittle credit appraisal expertise to properly assess the corresponding risks and returns are\nbelieved to be poor. NIDC has diversified its services and established leasing and banking\ndepartments, and operates a closed-end mutual fund.\n18. Overemphasis on Credit, Neglect of Savings. Nepal has overstressed the lending\nfunctions of the banking system while neglecting the development of saving options.  This is\none reason why the nation\u2019s rate of savings mobilization is among the lowest in Asia. From the\nindividual household perspective, savings are an asset and borrowings are a liability, but the\ntwo can be used to finance investment and smooth consumption. As earned interest on savings\nadds to family income while interest paid on debt reduces it, adding to the household debt is\nmore likely to reduce people\u2019s welfare than raise it, in particular in a stagnant economy where\nfamilies have few good investment options. If the cost of capital, which is often high because of\nhigh transaction cost, cannot be matched by investment returns, credit may be contributing to\npoverty rather than reducing it. In such an environment, family savings are better suited to\nfinance small businesses or help offset a poor crop year, and make it unnecessary to visit the\nlocal moneylender who often charges rates as high as 5 percent per month. The main objective\nof reform in the rural finance sector should be to expand the range of both saving and borrowing\nopportunities for farmers on a competitive basis and to minimize transaction cost.\n19. Limited Outreach and Poor Quality of Rural Financial Services. Both formal and\nsemiformal  rural  financial  services  in  Nepal  have  inadequate  outreach.  Spatially,  they  are\nconcentrated in the Terai; operationally, they are biased in favor of agriculture; and in depth of\noutreach, the poor have limited access. By 1997, the entire system of formal sector credit\nprograms and institutions had reached a cumulative coverage of about 23 percent of the rural", "7\npopulation.9  The  diffused  institutional  and  policy  framework  for  micro  and  rural  finance\ninstitutions  is  partly  to  blame  for  this  low  figure.  The  combined  coverage  of  ADBN  and\ncommercial banks, whose loans were essentially collateral-based, was about 20 percent. The\nactual coverage of the rural poor, judging from the coverage of the group-based loans, was\nmuch  lower  at  3  percent.  By  implication,  the  remainder  is  borrowing  from  noninstitutional\nsources. That is not bad in itself, except that the credit review reported that only 13 percent of\nthese borrowings were for productive purposes. The causes of low institutional and productive\nborrowings may be many, but in the wake of an intensive agriculture and rural development\nplan in the country under the Agricultural Perspective Plan, it is important to ensure that all\nstrata of the rural population have easy access to a broad range of financial services.\n20. Underdeveloped Capital Markets. As in most countries in its income group, Nepal\u2019s\nfinancial system relies heavily on banking transactions. The origins of the Nepalese capital\nmarket can be traced back more than 20 years, but the capital market was given a proper\nstructure only in 1993. Though the creation of the capital market immediately attracted the\ninterests of the retail investors, in size and maturity it has not kept pace with the growth of the\nprivate sector. Up to now, about 110 companies are listed on the stock exchange with a market\ncapitalization of about NRs46 billion ($650 million equivalent). While registering some initial\nsuccesses, the Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) has little daily trading activity taking place,\nprimarily retail, in only a few select share issues (mainly financial institutions shares). The vast\nmajority of shares remain illiquid. Also, capital markets have so far not been playing a significant\nrole  for  long-term  financing,  e.g.,  of  infrastructure  or  capital  expansion.  Individuals  and\ninstitutions prefer to deposit savings in banks and fixed-interest government securities, even at\nvery low or even negative interest rates, than they would if the market was working properly.\nLong-term savings that should be invested in the capital market are going into short-term\ninstruments.  In  part,  this  stems  from  an  overall  weak  governance  structure  with  poor\naccountancy  standards  and  weak  disclosure  of  financial  information  -  which  offers  limited\ninvestor  protection  -  as  well  as  an  undeveloped  institutional  investor  base.  Institutional\nstrengthening of the regulator, SEBO, and the NEPSE will be required not only to avoid further\nconfidence  crisis  through  market  irregularities,  but  also  to  lay  the  foundation  for  a  more\ndiversified, resilient, and market-led financial sector. Although the current role of capital markets\nis small, their development is mutually reinforcing with improvements in corporate governance\nand information disclosure standards.\n21. Weak Information Technology Base. Nepal\u2019s financial system operates largely on a\nmanual basis. Therefore procedures are costly and cumbersome and poor service delivery.\nPayment and settlement systems are not fully computerized and no electronic funds transfers\nare possible. It may take up to 30 days to have a cheque cleared if it was issued outside\nKathmandu, and as a result, the economy is largely cash based. Moreover, the absence of IT in\nall areas of the financial sector makes information collection costly and unreliable, and hinders\neffective monitoring and supervision. It also increases the cost of branch operations and hinders\ncompetition.\n                  \n9 Sharma, S. R. et. al. 1997. Strengthening of Credit Institutions/Programs for Rural Poverty Alleviation in Nepal. A\nreport prepared for the United Nations/Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN/ESCAP).", "8\n3. Prospects and Priorities for Future Reforms and Development\n22. Financial reforms have been ongoing, on a piecemeal basis, for more than a decade,\nbut  have  not  yielded  significant  impacts  in  terms  of  improved  resource  mobilization  and\nintermediation efficiency. A more positive scenario in the future requires a clear vision and\ncredible commitment by the Government to address some of the policy inadequacies. This must\nbe anchored in demonstrated actions to shift the role of the Government away from being a\ndirect owner to being a prudential regulator and supervisor of financial sector activity. In doing\nso, the Government will need to ensure that it does not evolve into an overly bureaucratic\nregulatory structure but that it maintains constant dialogue with major market participants.\n23. The reform agenda is huge, and is more likely to be implemented over a 10-year horizon\nthan a short-term program period. However, urgent measures need to be adopted, particularly\nwith respect to the SOCBs to avert a larger crisis and to lay the foundation for sustainable\ndevelopment of the sector.  Policy reforms must be sequenced and coordinated properly and be\nin line with institutional development to effectively implement them. Thus, capacity building in a\nwider  range  of  areas  must  be  emphasized  during  the  early  program  period,  requiring\nconsiderable resources for TA. To gain and maintain momentum, some real and visible benefits\nwill need to be front-loaded to the extent possible. The planned use of IT is a very powerful tool\nin this respect. Significant benefits of policy and institutional reforms as well as better use of IT\nare expected in certain rural areas where transaction costs are highest and accessibility is\nlowest. The development of rural markets must be an integral part of a comprehensive reform\nprogram. Effective coordination with and feedback from stakeholders throughout the reform\nprocess are imperative for successful reforms and broad-based ownership.\n24. In pursuing further financial sector reforms, it is important to recognize the continuing\nrole  of  traditional  financial  conventions  and  informal  credit  sources  in  Nepal\u2019s  economy.\nCooperatives  have  not  supplanted  moneylenders,  and  branch  offices  of  ADBN  have  not\nreached a significant portion of the population.  In rural credit, at least one half of farm - family\nloans come from moneylenders, suppliers, or sales agents.  The formal and informal sectors are\nin  some  ways  competitive  and  in  other  ways  complementary.  Smoothing  rural  financial\nintermediation by providing improved access to information and greater choices for savings and\ninvestment will be crucial for growth, employment generation, and ultimately, poverty alleviation.\nB. Government Policies and Plans\n25. A key objective of the Ninth Five-Year Plan, FY1998-FY2002 (Ninth Plan) is to combat\npoverty  by  increasing  investment  and  reduce  dependence  on  foreign  borrowing  through\nimproved domestic resource mobilization. Policy measures for the financial sector that were\nspecified in the Ninth Plan include (i) lowering barriers to entry, (ii) allowing mergers and\ntakeovers to promote competition, (iii) privatization of Government-owned banks and nonbank\nfinancial institutions (NBFIs), (iv) recapitalization of major banks, (v) making the debt recovery\nsystem  effective,  (vi)  expanding  microfinance  services  for  poverty  reduction,  and  (vii)\nstrengthening NRB\u2019s supervisory and regulatory capacity. The finance minister reiterated the\nimportance  of  financial  sector  development  during  the  FY2000  budget  speech,  stating\n\u201cDevelopment of the financial sector and capital market is necessary to provide sustainable\nsupport to the economic growth of the country\u201d.10 Prioritization of corporate and financial sector\nreforms  has  continued  in  the  Government\u2019s  FY2001  programs  and  budget.  Moreover,  the\nAgriculture Perspective Plan, the Government\u2019s 20-year plan for rural development, which was\n                  \n10 Ministry of Finance.  1999.  Budget Speech for Fiscal Year 1999-2000", "9\ninitiated in 1995, identifies credit as one of the key inputs for boosting agricultural production. A\nrecent  review  of  the  plan  concludes  that  weaknesses  in  the  financial  sector  constrain  its\nimplementation. While the Ninth Plan highlights the critical link the financial sector plays in\nchanneling savings into productive investments, it also notes deficiencies in the current system\nthat impede this process. To address these deficiencies, the Ninth Plan stresses the need to\ncreate an environment that increases the efficiency of financial institutions so as to generate\ninternal resources for the country\u2019s development.\n26. Among the main complaints of investors is the high interest rates on loans. The Ninth\nPlan points to high operating costs of banks as the cause of large spreads between deposit and\nlending rates. These high operating costs in turn are caused by weak financial management\nsystems,  high  compulsory  cash  reserve  ratio,  growing  proportion  of  bad  debts,  and\nunnecessary expansion of organizations. However, while the FY2000 budget speech does call\nfor the formulation of laws on the repayment of loans and bankruptcy to address those costs,\nthe speech also calls for better enforcement of the mandated 5 percent interest spread to force\nlower  rates.  In  other  areas,  policy-related  operating  costs  may  actually  be  increased.  For\nexample, while the Ninth Plan admits that directed credit programs would need to be phased\nout in the future, the Government will in fact expand such programs during the current planning\nperiod. The expansion of directed credit programs is also reflected in the FY2000 budget\nspeech, in which the rural credit programs are nearly all aimed at a list of specific activities\nranging from milk processing to solar energy.\n27. One important aspect of enhancing the efficiency of financial institutions is raising the\nlevel of corporate governance standards in the country. The Ninth Plan proposes to increase\npublic confidence in and liquidity of the securities market by protecting investor rights and\npromoting  corporate  transparency.  Toward  this  end,  adopting  international  accounting\nstandards, establishing a secured transaction center and a central security depository system,\nand  upgrading  the  credit  rating  system  play  important  roles.  Improving  transparency  and\ndisclosure standards will support the Government\u2019s privatization plans by helping to assess a\nfair price and facilitating performance monitoring following privatization.\nC. External Assistance to the Sector\n28. ADB lending to develop Nepal\u2019s financial institutions has traditionally focused on rural\nfinance - mainly through ADBN - and microfinance.  Although ADBN was established under\nsome of ADB\u2019s first assistance to Nepal, experience in more recent projects suggests that\nestablishing  the  appropriate  regulatory  environment  must  take  precedence  over  continued\nfinancial  support  to  that  institution.    Recent  TA  work  in  financial  sector  development  and\ncorporate governance provides the groundwork for the reform agenda outlined in this Project\n(Appendix 1).  Ongoing TA in the sector supports the reform process by building up the\naccounting and auditing profession through the strengthening of ICAN, reform of the company\nlaw and development of legislation for insolvency and secured transactions, and creating a focal\npoint within MOF to sustain the momentum and augment capacity for financial sector reform\n(footnotes 2 and 3).\n29. The IMF has been a strong advocate of financial sector development in Nepal.  To\nsupport the reform efforts of HMGN after the establishment of multiparty democracy in 1990, the\nIMF  approved  a  three-year  Enhanced  Structural  Adjustment  Facility  (ESAF)  of  SDR33.57\nmillion  in  October  1992,  the  policy  framework  of  which  included  financial  sector  reforms.\nSpecific  reforms  covered  the  restructuring  of  RBB  and  NBL,  with  the  goal  of  eventually\nprivatizing the two state-owned banks, strengthening the supervision capacity of the NRB as", "10\nwell as its monetary control and management functions, and capital market development.  Due\nto the rise in political instability after the fall of the majority government, reform measures stalled\nand the ESAF arrangement expired in October 1995 after only SDR16.79 million was disbursed.\nHowever, IMF TA helped strengthen the monetary operations of NRB, including compilation and\nreporting  of  monetary  statistics,  and  establishing  a  secondary  window  for  the  government\nsecurities at the central bank. During the IMF's preliminary discussions with the Government on\na possible Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) program, financial sector reforms\nremain a high priority, with emphasis on improved banking supervision and commercial bank\nreforms. ADB staff also joined the IMF Article IV Consultation Mission to Nepal in 1999 and\n2000, providing feedback on the proposed policy matrix for a PRGF program and discussing the\ndivision of labor between ADB and IMF in reforming Nepal\u2019s financial sector.\n30. The World Bank supported the financial sector reforms under its Second Structural\nAdjustment Credit, a quick-disbursing credit amounting to $60 million, approved in 1989, with\nthree  tranche  releases  contingent  on  a  number  of  policy  conditions.  The  financial  sector\nadjustment program under this credit focused on the SOCBs and the central bank. While the\nestablishment of CIB was a condition for submitting the project to the Board, most of the first\nand second tranche conditions for strengthening financial sector reforms consisted of preparing\nstudies and action plans. For release of the third tranche, the conditions included Government\nfunding for provisioning and recapitalization of the SOCBs, and payments for the unpaid debt of\nnonfinancial  public  enterprises.  While  the  conditions  were  not  fully  met,  the  tranche  was\nnevertheless released in 1992. However, while NBL has been partially privatized, RBB is again\nin need of recapitalization due to continued poor management at the operation level.  The World\nBank\u2019s proposed Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project will continue to focus on the\ncommercial banking subsector and the NRB\u2019s supervisory capacity. Preparatory TA is ongoing,\nbeginning with an audit of RBB by international auditors and a resident consultant in NRB to\nstrengthen the central bank\u2019s supervision functions.\n31. UNDP financed the Government\u2019s Commercial Bank Problem Analysis and Strategy\nStudy, which provided background information for much of the financial sector reforms under\nthe World Bank\u2019s Second Structural Adjustment Credit.  DFID has ongoing TA to MOF in the\narea of corporate governance for state-owned enterprises under its Privatization Project as well\nas legal reforms under its Enabling State Project. Some initial work to assist ICAN in formulating\nits strategic plan has also been supported by DFID. In addition, Danida and GTZ are providing\nassistance  in  reforming  and  strengthening  tax  administration,  as  well  as  support  to  the\ncooperative and microfinance subsector, particularly small farmers development. The proposed\nProject aims at complementing and reinforcing some of these activities.\n32. In preparation for this Project, ADB and the World Bank held a joint financial sector\nreform stakeholder consultation workshop in Kathmandu in September 1999.  Representatives\nfrom  the  Government,  private  sector,  academe,  and  aid  agencies  participated  in  the\ndiscussions.  Nepal  Resident  Mission  (NRM)  staff  participated  in  the  regular  aid  agency\ncoordination meetings on governance chaired by UNDP as well as on financial sector reforms\nchaired by the World Bank.  Progress has been made in establishing an appropriate division of\nlabor in the financial sector between ADB and World Bank during regular review missions in\nNepal, as well as World Bank consultation missions to ADB in November 1999 and again in\nOctober 2000. Discussions with the World Bank and other aid agencies will continue during the\nProject to avoid duplication of efforts or conflicting advice to the Government.", "11\nD. Lessons Learned\n33. General lessons learned from ADB operations in Nepal, as outlined in the Country\nOperational Strategy,11 point to the need for broad-based support for policy and institutional\nreforms to achieve and sustain any meaningful change.  To this end, stakeholder participation is\ncritical  at  the  project  design  stage,  particularly  in  formulating  policy  reforms.    Institutional\nstrengthening  and  capacity  building  initiatives  should  be  consistent  with  a  plan  for  short-,\nmedium-, and long-term sector development. Project preparation should include an analysis of\nissues and strategies for improving governance and combating corruption.  A recent study of\npostevaluation  findings  for  ADB  projects  in  Nepal12  emphasizes  the  need  for  rigorous\nassessment of the capabilities of the executing agencies.  Moreover, for projects with multiple\nimplementing agencies, it is necessary to clarify their roles and functions from the start.\n34. Evaluation  of  ADB\u2019s  assistance  to  Nepal\u2019s  rural  financial  sector  through  ADBN13\nindicates that lending by ADBN has not achieved its intended impact, mainly as a result of\ndistorted  incentive  structures  for  staff  and  management  and  poor  operational  policies  and\nsystems,  leading  to  decapitalization  of  the  institution.  While  ADBN  experienced  a  rapid\nexpansion of operational scope and a modest degree of institutional strengthening, it did not\naddress endemic problems associated with information flow, contract monitoring, and enforcing\nrepayment from farmer borrowers. The persistence of high transaction costs also precluded\neffective competition with established informal lenders. Overall the project performance audit\nreport  (PPAR)  concludes  that  ADBN's  operations  were  not  sustainable,  financially  and\neconomically. The PPAR proposes a reframing of ADBN's structure and mission for the rural\nsectors. In the future, considerable practical attention needs to be devoted to anticipating and to\nreducing transaction costs, information deficiencies, and moral hazard in rural finance. These\nthree terms are central to the rationale and design of this Project and should be more fully\ndiscussed with reference to actual problems faced.\n35. PPARs for two recently completed financial sector reform projects in Sri Lanka and\nIndia14  also  emphasize  the  importance  of  Government  ownership  of  the  reform  agenda,\nincluding the pace and sequence of reforms. The World Bank\u2019s experience in financial sector\nreform in Nepal under its Second Structural Adjustment Credit demonstrated the need for\ninvolving the Government at the design stage. Furthermore, a project must (i) show a clear\nrelationship between its objectives and the policy measures; (ii) include consistent, monitorable\nperformance benchmarks; (iii) assess the sustainability and practicality of policy measures; and\n(iv) address the financial implications of the policy measures. Project design must address\ninstitutional  weaknesses  and  consider  the  extent  of  political  support  for  policy  measures,\nparticularly those that affect vested interests.  Finally, loan conditions should include well-\ndefined  actions  and  targets,  rather  than  studies  to  determine  future  measures  or  vaguely\nworded performance indicators.\nE.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n36. Toward the goal of sustainable reductions in poverty in Nepal, the strategic approach of\nADB\u2019s Country Operational Strategy (footnote 11) is to build effective institutions needed to\n                  \n11 STS: NEP 99006: Country Operational Strategy Study, Nepal, July 1999.\n12 Asian Development Bank Postevaluation Findings: Country Synthesis of Evaluation Findings in Nepal, October\n1999.\n13 PEO 502, Loan 831 NEP: Fifth Agricultural Credit Project, December 1997.\n14 Loan SRI 1051: Financial Sector Program, for $80 million, approved on 20 November 1990; and Loan IND 1208:\nFinancial Sector Program, for $300 million, approved on 15 December 1992.", "12\nimplement socioeconomic development in a market economy.  In this context, financial sector\ndevelopment  aims  at  (i)  increasing  the  stability  and  resilience  of  the  sector  by  improving\nsupervisory  standards  and  supporting  the  development  of  alternative  second-tier  financial\ninstitutions  to  foster  competition;  (ii)  improving  the  efficiency  of  financial  intermediation  by\nincreasing transparency and access to information while depoliticizing the process of allocating\nresources; (iii) improving access to and quality of financial services, particularly in rural areas;\nand  (iv)  supporting  regional  integration  within  the  South  Asian  Association  for  Regional\nCooperation. To achieve these strategic objectives, the operational priorities have to respond to\nNepal\u2019s generic financial sector needs for policy support, institution building, and transparent\nregulatory framework before direct assistance for specific market segments and intermediaries\ncan be contemplated.\n37. Starting from a very low base, a mixture of quite different activities is required, such as\ntraining of judges and linking financial service providers through IT. During the early phases,\nthese may appear somehow scattered, but they will flow together toward a coherent system\nover the medium to long term. Without addressing a range of areas simultaneously at an early\nstage, long-term sustainability cannot be achieved.\n38. Given the complexities and interlinkages of the sector a wholistic approach with various\nphases over about 10 years will be pursued to ensure a significant and sustainable impact.\nPhase I, to be implemented with the support of the Project over 3-4 years, will focus on the\ncreation of basic financial sector infrastructure and a sound enabling environment.  Specifically,\nphase I aims at (i) creating a policy and legal environment for effective competition, based on\nsound economic and sector work; (ii) capacity building for key institutions for financial sector\nregulation, supervision, and legal enforcement; (iii) improving information disclosure standards\nand corporate governance, including accounting and auditing standards as well as capital\nmarkets development; and (iv) introducing basic IT for improved transparency and financial\nservice delivery. ADB\u2019s focus will be NBFIs, including DFIs, rural finance, and capital markets,\nand the World Bank will look after the commercial banking sector.\n39. Phase II will continue capacity building measures initiated under phase I, but expand the\ninstitutional level to include restructuring of selected lending institutions such as ADBN and\nNIDC. The use of information and communications technology (ICT), for electronic (e)-banking\nand supporting e-commerce, will be pursued more vigorously. Some preparatory work toward\nthis effect will be undertaken in phase I. Some work on deposit insurance coverage will also be\nrequired to better deal with the political economy of bank restructuring. In addition, deepened\ncapital markets will be through development of contractual savings and further outreach in rural\nfinancial markets will be pursued. Privatization of state-owned enterprises and reforms in trade\nand industry will be undertaken to complement financial sector reforms. Phase III will follow up\non the restructuring of selected lending institutions, broaden and deepen the financial market\nfurther, and pursue regional integration more rigorously.  The full benefits of the overall reform\nprocess will only become available upon completion of the cycle, but phase I in particular is\nneeded to allow the growth of financial markets in a sustained manner.\n40. Special emphasis will be given to nonbank financial intermediation and the development\nof rural financial markets. Toward this end, ADB has developed a rural finance strategy, which\nwas discussed with a large number of stakeholders in Kathmandu in February 2000. The\nvarious strategic components that were proposed are supported by the Project and aim at\nimproving the environment for rural financial services, allowing new entrants, and strengthening\nthe existing ones. In addition, ADB will explore complementary activities to promote private\nsector development, particularly for small and medium-scale enterprises.", "13\nF. Policy Dialogue\n41. Policy  dialogue  has  focused  essentially  on  (i)  sector  governance  and  role  of  the\ngovernment;  (ii)  prevailing  sector  policies  for  rural  finance  and  NBFIs;  (iii)  improving  the\nlegislative  and  regulatory  environment,  including  measures  to  enhance  transparency  and\ninstitutional strengthening; (iv) legal enforcement mechanisms and measures to improve the\njudicial system; and (v) introducing selected legislation. At this stage, ADB\u2019s dialogue largely\navoided detailed discussion of restructuring the state-owned financial institutions, particularly\nthe DFIs, which will follow once progress is made on the policy, governance, and regulatory\nfront.\n42. To improve overall sector governance direct participation, ADB together with IMF and\nthe World Bank has stressed the need for HMGN to shift its role from one of regulation and\nprudential supervision. Further clarification is required as regards the institutional setup and\nmandate  of  the  key  regulators,  which  will  be  subject  to  ongoing  dialogue.  The  governing\nlegislation of NRB will be revised to provide a high degree of independence within a well-\ndefined policy framework and clear accountability. Legislation governing the financial institutions\nis also being reviewed to ensure equal opportunities for state-owned and private sector market\nparticipants. To facilitate this process, HMGN has agreed to establish a Corporate and Financial\nLaw Review Committee to ensure that a consistent and consultative process is applied. This\ncommittee  will  also  review  other  laws  related  to  the  sector  to  streamline  the  legislative\nframework. Also, official translation of key economic laws will be provided and a legal resource\ncenter for online access to all corporate and financial sector legislation will be established.\n43. To remove policy impediments to extension of rural financial services, the Government\nhas agreed to further rationalize interest rates, and to review the priority and directed credit\nsector lending requirements as well as branch licensing policies. In this regard, the urban\nbranch network of ADBN - and rural branch regulation for commercial banks - will be reviewed\nfurther. Subsidized credit schemes may be justifiable, but should be funded in a transparent\nmanner through the budget, not through the banking system. The Government agreed to spinoff\nADBN small farmers subproject offices into cooperatives, with possible assistance by GTZ.\n44. In the areas of corporate governance and capital market development, HMGN with\nassistance from ADB, has formulated a new Securities Act that provides for an autonomous and\naccountable SEBO including significant private sector representation on its Board. In addition,\nthe NEPSE will be privatized. To promote improved accounting standards and information\ndisclosure, HMGN has agreed to repeal the Auditors Act and give full effectivity to the ICAN Act,\nand to consider the controlled opening of the services sector to qualified foreign legal and\naccounting professionals to allow transfer of skills. Options to enhance the role of the SEBO or\nOffice  of  the  Companies  Registrar  in  information  disclosure  also  for  tax  purposes  will  be\ndiscussed further under the Project. An official English translation of key corporate legislation\nwill improve transparency for foreign investors. HMGN further agreed to the establishment of a\njudicial academy for training of judges and government and private sector lawyers under the\nJudicial  Council  chaired  by  the  Chief  Justice,  with  sufficient  commercial  orientation,  and\nimprovement in funding allocations to the judiciary. For developing the legal profession, the Bar\nAssociation of Nepal recently set up an examination to certify qualified lawyers. To improve\njudiciary transparency and accountability, there will be disclosure of assets by all judges and\npublication of an annual report to the public. HMGN also agreed to support the introduction of e-\nbanking and e-commerce, installed and operated by the private sector or on a public-private\npartnership basis, and allow electronic funds transfer within a well-regulated and supervised\nframework. It further agreed to protect the required frequencies for this network.", "14\n45. The Government incorporated many elements from the ongoing policy dialogue in its\nbackground paper on financial sector development, which was presented to the aid community\nat the Nepal Development Forum in Paris in April 2000, as well as its financial sector strategy\nstatement released in August 2000. However, given the complex and dynamic nature of the\nsector, policy dialogue will be continued throughout project implementation.\nIV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n46. To escape poverty, Nepal must achieve a per capita annual growth rate of 5 percent or\nmore on a sustained basis. This rate is much higher than the current 2 to 3 percent per year.\nThus,  to  reduce  widespread  poverty  encountered  in  Nepal,  growth  and  employment\nopportunities must be generated. This requires higher levels of investment - and saving to fund\ninvestment - as well as more efficient use of resources. Sustained private-sector-led growth and\nincreased productive activities by a greater portion of the population, in turn, must be supported\nby an effective financial system. Such a system comprises a complex set of laws, regulations,\npolicies, practices, institutions, and technology that link savers and investors in the economy to\nallow effective allocation of financial resources. An ADB study15 concludes that, with an effective\nfinancial system in place, Nepal\u2019s annual growth could be boosted by as much as 2 percent per\nannum, effectively bridging the gap to escape the trap of poverty.\n47. An  effective  financial  system  offers  a  positive  incentive  structure  for  financial\nintermediation. It provides positive returns to a wide range of savers, provides timely and\ncompetitively  priced  credit  to  a  wide  range  of  borrowers;  and,  through  a  wide  range  of\ninstruments and institutions, allocates society\u2019s scarce capital to its most efficient, growth-\npromoting uses. As more effective financial intermediation reduces the cost of capital, the return\nof investment that is required to break even is lowered, which in turn will result in more\nsuccessful  investment  and  employment  generation.  In  addition,  a  sound  financial  system\nmitigates vulnerability to financial crisis and the economic and social costs that follow financial\ndisruption.  Broader  and  deeper  financial  markets  are  important  because  of  the  stability,\nefficiency, and access they confer, all of which are key determinants of prosperity and poverty\nreduction.\n48. Unfortunately, Nepal\u2019s financial system has been ineffective in fulfilling its role and is\ninherently vulnerable. The system is marred by many shortcomings (paras. 8-21), which lead to\ndistorted incentive structures, high transaction costs, and misallocation of capital. It is therefore\nimportant to adjust Nepal\u2019s financial system to reduce the high costs and increase access to\ninformation, capital, and savings opportunities, particularly in rural areas where 90 percent of\nNepal\u2019s population live. A very basic element of this adjustment is improvement in corporate\nand financial governance structures.\n49. The importance of corporate governance is one of the important lessons of the Asian\ncrisis. Absence of basic governance provisions such as on the role of directors and managers,\ngenerally accepted accounting standards, and transparent information disclosure leads to moral\nhazard and adverse selection16 and puts at risk the sustainability of the corporate sector, which\n                  \n15 TA 3135-NEP: Financial Sector Regulation and Governance, for $150,000, approved on 22 December 1998.\n16 Moral hazard and adverse selection describe situations in which incentive structures or asymmetric information\nleads to perverse economic outcomes.", "15\nis  closely  interlinked  with  the  health  of  the  financial  sector.  Good  corporate  and  financial\ngovernance standards are essential for a conducive investment framework.\n50. In pursuing any reforms in the private and financial sector, it is important to keep in mind\nthat  Nepal\u2019s  economy  is  closely  linked  to  India\u2019s  economy,  which  underwent  significant\nstructural changes over the past years. If Nepal\u2019s investment environment cannot compete with\nits dominant immediate neighbor, resources and investment will dry up or even flow out of the\ncountry. As a small landlocked country, Nepal has to lead rather than follow the reform process\nto offer comparative advantages to investors. Thus, the challenge for Nepal is to create a\nfinancial system that is supportive of growth.\n51. The Project initiates a much-needed structured approach for long-term financial and\nprivate  sector  development.  This  requires  the  establishment  of  an  effective  regulatory,\ninstitutional and technological framework. The project framework is in Appendix 2.\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n52. The long-term goal of the Project is to contribute to higher and more equitably distributed\nof economic growth through a robust and efficient financial sector. This will be achieved through\nimproved  transparency,  accountability,  and  basic  financial  sector  infrastructure,  leading  to\nincreased competition and better services, coupled with reduced transaction costs in financial\nintermediation. In pursuing this goal, the Project is part of a multidimensional and long-term\nreform process.\n53. The  immediate  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  governance  and  efficiency  in\nNepal\u2019s corporate and financial sector. Specifically, this involves\n(i)  improving selected parts of the legal and regulatory framework, standards, and\npolicies, particularly those relating to accounting, auditing, companies, securities,\nand rural finance;\n(ii)  capacity building for essential regulatory, supervisory, or service institutions for\nthe Project, including sections of NRB, Auditor General, ICAN, SEBO,  NEPSE,\nCentral  Depository  System  (CDS),  Company  Registrar\u2019s  Office  (CRO),  and\nestablishment of a secured transactions registry;\n(iii)  capacity  building  for  improved  legal  drafting  and  enforcement  of  laws  by\nestablishing of the National Judicial Academy (NJA) to enhance the skills of\njudges,  court  officials,  officials  exercising  quasi-judicial  powers,  Government\nlawyers and private practitioners, particularly in keeping abreast with new and\nchanging legislation;\n(iv)  improving financial service delivery by strengthening the payment system and\nsupporting the institutional infrastructure for future investment in ICT through a\npublic-private partnership, the electronic Financial Information & Technology (e-\nFIT) company; and\n(v)  preparing to restructure and develop selected financial intermediaries, including\nADBN, NIDC, Employees Provident Fund, and the insurance industry.\n54. The  Project  will  contribute  to  a  consistent  and  transparent  legal  and  regulatory\nframework for corporate and financial governance, with effective implementation institutions.\nThe objective is to give the public more reliable financial information and reduce the scope for\nrent-seeking activities by few individuals at the expense of the larger society. The Project also", "16\nintends to foster competition and support expansion of financial services. As a result, economic\ntransaction costs should go down (through reduction in both information acquisition cost and\nbad lending/investment decisions). The improved environment will support the development of\nnew savings alternatives, and new avenues for funding of companies (including capital markets)\nhave a better chance of realization.\n55. The  Project  contains  a  mix  of  loan  and  TA  grant-funded  components  for  advisory\nservices,  with  TA  proposed  under  an  associated  TA  cluster.  The  loan  and  TA-funded\ncomponents blend and complement each other. Using a process approach, at a conceptual\nlevel ADB\u2019s overall assistance package for the Project also comprises the TAs approved in\n1999 and 2000 for strengthening accounting and auditing; review of company, insolvency, and\nsecured transaction law; and reform coordination (footnotes 2 and 3, and Table 1).\nTable 1: ADB Assistance (ongoing and proposed)a\nAssistance Area Loan Financed TA Grant Financed\n1.

From a subsector perspective, the proposed Project will focus on nonbank financial\nintermediation, including rural finance, DFIs, capital markets, and the corporate sector. Key", "17\nissues related to commercial banks will be addressed under proposed assistance by the World\nBank. Some components, such as adoption of international accounting standards, streamlining\nof legislation, or strengthening the capacity of NRB, will have wider sector implications and will\nbe appropriately coordinated with other aid agencies, particularly the IMF and World Bank.\n57. Specifically, the proposed Project includes the following:\n1. Improving Legal and Regulatory Framework, Standards, and Policies\n58. Improving  the  basic  legislative,  and  regulatory  framework  as  well  as  policies  and\nstandards is the fundamental step in a longer term reform process. In terms of sequencing, this\narea must be addressed first before assistance is provided on the institutional level. ADB has\nalready initiated steps in this regard under the ongoing TAs. Further assistance will be provided\nunder the proposed TA cluster.\na. Upgrading of Selected Legislation\n59. Past  and  ongoing  assistance  to  strengthen  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for\ncorporate governance has included support in drafting the Securities Act (TA 2834: Capital\nMarket Development), and support for reform of the company law, insolvency law, and secured\ntransactions law (footnote 2).\n60. The new Securities Act, currently in draft form, will establish the Nepal SEBO as an\nindependent statutory body and provide for a legal and regulatory framework for registration and\nissuance of securities, licensing, and regulation of stock exchanges and those engaged in\nsecurities business, and curbing of malpractices including insider trading.\n61. Reform of the company law, under TA 3461, will strengthen disclosure requirements for\ncompanies.  It  will  introduce  provisions  to  regulate  self-dealing  by  directors  and  controlling\nshareholders, and strengthen minority shareholders\u2019 rights, allowing representative actions by\nminority  shareholders  to  enforce  good  corporate  governance.  Presently  charges  over  a\ncompany\u2019s assets are not registered with the company registrar. Such registration will need to\nbe  compulsory  to  create  transparency  for  those  dealing  with  companies.  Reform  of  the\ncompany law will also include examining of the role of the various agencies and offices involved\nin implementing the company law, including the CRO, the Company Law Board (CLB), SEBO,\nand  the  courts,  so  as  to  rationalize  the  institutional  arrangements  for  administering  and\nenforcing of the company law.\n62. The support for drafting of insolvency and secured transaction legislation, also under TA\n3461, will ensure an orderly process for exit or restructuring of companies in financial difficulties,\nand strengthen the collateralization process for movable assets. This will contribute to good\ncorporate  governance  as  the  potential  use  of  efficient  insolvency  and  debt  enforcement\nprocedures will discipline firms to contract only debts that they can service.\n63. HMGN, with support from other aid agencies, has initiated a number of other legislative\nreform initiatives. Most important is the review of the NRB Act and development of an unified\nFinancial Institutions Act covering all institutions involved in lending and deposit taking activities.\nADB has been requested to provide inputs into the drafting process to ensure consistency\nparticularly with regard to the securities, companies, and insolvency laws.", "18\n64. Even  with  the  ongoing  activities,  numerous  inconsistencies  and  contradictions  in\ncommercial, corporate, and financial legislation remain. Under TA1 of the TA cluster, assistance\nwill be provided to further streamline commercial and financial laws as required, such as laws\nrelating  to  rural  and  microfinance,  IT  and  e-commerce-related  activities,  and  legislation  to\nmandate the boards and the standards they set. HMGN is considering reconstituting the Law\nReform Commission to institutionalize the reform process. Depending on the pace at which\nHMGN moves, assistance may be provided to the Law Reform Commission.\nb.  Development of Information Disclosure, and Accounting and\nAuditing Standards\n65. Assistance is included for improvements in the accounting and auditing standards. The\ncompany law reform provides for an information disclosure system that can serve the needs of\na modern financial system. It will include (i) recognition of an Accounting Standards Board and\nan Auditing Standards Board (ASB/AuSB) - collectively the boards; (ii) recognition of mandatory\ncompliance with the standards issued by these boards; (iii) appropriately severe penalties for\nnoncompliance with these standards; and (iv) recognizing of an office of the chief accountant\nwithin SEBO and empowering that Office to enforce proper information disclosure and reporting\nby investigating and penalizing any non-compliance.\n66. In developing the accounting and auditing profession, the role of ICAN will be crucial.\nFor ICAN to develop in a professional manner, repeal of the Auditors Act is imperative as the\nact currently provides official recognition to auditors of lower standards. ICAN has submitted to\nMOF an amendment to the ICAN Act that will be submitted to Parliament during the winter\nsession in February 2001. Importantly, ICAN agrees to accept all existing registered auditors\n(RAs) as ICAN members on a one-time exemption basis within six months of repealing the\nAuditors Act. This is to ensure a professional future for the existing RAs. Through TA 3356\n(footnote 2), ICAN is in the process of preparing training programs that will assist these RAs in\nupgrading their skills.\n67. The independent accounting and auditing standards boards are being established under\nTA 3356. The boards will at first develop standards based on international accounting standards\n(IAS) and international auditing standards (IAuS) for the private sector through a participatory\nmethod.\n68. For Nepal\u2019s Government departments, the current cash-based accounting standards\napplied are completely unsuited to the management of assets and liabilities, while auditing\npractices also need to be improved. Moreover, many unrealistic \u201cauditing\u201d duties are set down\nin  disparate  processes  and  legislation,  placing  inappropriate  and  unrealistic  demands  on\nauditors.\n69. Internationally,  convergence  of  public  and  private  sector  accounting  and  auditing\nstandards is occurring. For example, the International Public Sector Committee (IPSC) has just\nissued eight public sector accounting standards heavily based on IAS. The efforts made under\nTA 3356 will establish much of the infrastructure also needed for the public sector. Once the\nboards  are  established,  in  addition  to  their  roles  in  relation  to  private  sector  corporate\naccounting  and  auditing  standards,  they  will  be  able  to  develop  accounting  and  auditing\nstandards  for  the  public  sector.  In  carrying  out  this  responsibility,  it  is  presumed  that  the\nfinancial reporting and auditing requirements of the public and private sectors will be entirely\nconsistent with one another and identical in most instances.", "19\n70. Integration of the public and private sector efforts in accounting and auditing standards\nin the medium to long run will greatly facilitate introduction of a consistent accounting and\nauditing system in Nepal. This will ultimately require public sector entities to exhibit greater\ntransparency  and  accountability,  and  greatly  facilitate  state-owned  enterprise  reform  and\nprivatization,  including  flotation  on  the  stock  exchange.  The  public  sector  claim  that  their\nreporting should be fundamentally different from that of the private sector is difficult to justify,\nbut  transitional  strategies  can  move  the  public  sector  to  a  system  based  on  full  accrual\naccounting.\n71. Under TA2 of the cluster TA,  the Auditor General and the Comptroller General of\nFinance will be assisted in moving towards uniform standards. TA2 will assist the key public\nsector entities in adopting internationally accepted accounting standards issued by the Public\nSector  Committee  of  the  International  Federation  of  Accountants  (IFAC)  and  the  auditing\nstandards  issued  by  the  International  Auditing  Practices  Committee  (IAPC),  by  providing\nintensive training activities. Similarly, the accounting and auditing standards boards will be\nacquainted with strategies for broadening the applicability of standards, and, where necessary,\ntheir content, to allow application of the standards to all forms of public sector bodies. TA2 will\ngive an initial opportunity to public sector entities and auditors to commence development of\nexpertise and systems, with the objective of upgrading their knowledge and skills for carrying\nout  audits  based  on  a  system  of  full  accrual  accounting,  in  accordance  with  accounting\nstandards similar to those applicable in the private sector. TA2 will identify how this can occur.\n2. Capacity Building for Key Institutions\n72. To increase the capacity of key regulatory, supervisory, and service institutions for\ncorporate  and  financial  governance,  the  Project  will  support  the  development  of  SEBO,\nstrengthening  and  privatization  of  NEPSE,  establishment  of  CDS  for  securities,  and\nimprovements in the operations of CRO. Assistance in this regard will be financed under a loan\ncomponent (component A). In addition, technical support will be provided under the TA cluster\nto the boards and the Auditor General for moving toward improved accounting and auditing\nstandards in the public sector, as well as for upgrading the capacity of NRB to regulate and\nsupervise NBFIs and rural finance.17\na. Strengthening SEBO and CRO\n73. Capacity  building  for  SEBO  under  the  Project  is  required  not  only  for  the  orderly\ndevelopment of Nepal\u2019s still nascent capital market, but also to enforce corporate governance\nand information disclosure provisions. Disclosure will be crucial for increased transparency in\nthe financial and corporate sector, and will boost business confidence and predictability in\nbusiness dealings.\n74. In defining the scope of the assistance to SEBO, it is important to recognize that SEBO\u2019s\nactivities at present are confined to companies that have listed securities and companies that\nare  eligible  to  list  them.  SEBO  does  not  deal  with  statutory  corporations.  The  existing\ninstitutional arrangements are inefficient and fraught with potential for regulatory arbitrage as a\nnumber of organizations are involved in regulation of companies\u2019 affairs, including the CRO and\nCLB.  For  SEBO  to  be  effective,  it  must  have  adequate  financial  resources  and  statutory\nautonomy  that  insulate  it  from  political  interference.  The  ongoing  TA  3461  will  formulate\nrecommendations for rationalization of the institutional environment and examine the possibility\n                  \n17 The World Bank will assist in strengthening NRB\u2019s capacity to regulate and supervise commercial banks.", "20\nof SEBO regulating all companies. Any form of rationalization may need to be phased and will\nrequire recognition of SEBO\u2019s role in developing the corporate sector as a whole.\n75. To enable SEBO to effectively supervise capital market activities and enforce corporate\ngovernance and information disclosure provisions, proposed assistance under loan component\nA will review and strengthen SEBO\u2019s organizational structure. The establishment of a chief\naccountant\u2019s office for SEBO will be crucial to ensure that accounting and auditing standards\nare observed. Detailed outputs of the assistance will include a corporate and financial plan\nconsistent  with  the  operational  and  financial  independence  of  SEBO,  including  review  of\nresponsibilities, duties, and job descriptions; refinement of performance parameters; setting up\nof  a  management  information  system;  and  further  definition  of  SEBO\u2019s  regulatory  duties.\nAssistance will also develop various securities market regulations, allow skills transfer to key\nSEBO staff, and provide training programs and public awareness strategy. Operations of CRO\nwill be streamlined and automated, to link with the newly automated income tax office to ensure\nconsistency of records and data and to facilitate enforcement.\nb. Strengthening NEPSE and CDS\n76. NEPSE, which is majority owned by HMGN, lacks the rules, regulations, discipline by\nmarket participants, and systems to instill confidence in the capital market. Support is required\nfor establishing a proper system for registering shares to ensure transparency and efficiency in\nsettlement.\n77. Under loan component A, ADB will support the privatization of NEPSE and assist it to\nbecome  a  self-regulatory  organization  with  transparent  governance  and  professional\nmanagement, complemented by upgrading of its operational systems and procedures. The\nrelationship between SEBO and NEPSE will be rationalized. To support improved transparency\nin shareholdings and ensure safe custody and settlement of company ownership titles, CDS will\nbe established to operate on a commercial basis.\nc. Strengthening NRB for Regulation of Nonbank Financial Institutions\n78. Over the past decade, financial intermediation activities in Nepal\u2019s rural areas have\nevolved but with distorted policies in a poorly regulated and supervised environment. A great\nnumber of nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and cooperatives mobilize and lend resources\noutside the regulatory environment, or the applicable financial rules and regulations are not\nenforced. Poor enforcement by NRB is due to (i) insufficient institutional capacity; (ii) lack of\nautonomy; (iii) conflicting roles of ownership and supervision of rural financial institutions (RFIs)\nby NRB; (iv) lack of focus, including NRB\u2019s involvement in developmental programs; and (v)\nmultiplicity of financial laws and regulations. The ongoing comprehensive review of the NRB Act\nand Financial Institutions Act is expected to sharpen the focus of NRB and help clarify its role\nand responsibilities.\n79. Following the streamlining of the regulatory and policy environment for rural finance,\nthere is a need to upgrade NRB\u2019s capacity for prudential supervision and enforcement to ensure\nthe sustainable and orderly expansion of the rural finance system.\n80. Cluster TA3 will review the prevailing policy framework pertaining to RFIs and rural\nfinance  operations  of  commercial  banks,  especially  as  it  relates  to  institutional  autonomy,\ngovernance, ownership, competition, directed credit, subsidies, and human resources. The TA\nwill assist in further rationalizing the legal framework governing the operations of the array of", "21\ninstitutions involved in rural finance so as to eliminate gaps, ambiguities, and overlaps. It will\nfurther  assess  the  regulation  and  supervision  needs  of  RFIs;  assess  NRB\u2019s  capacity  for\nregulation, supervision, and enforcement and recommend improvements; develop prudential\nnorms, information and disclosure systems, accounting, auditing, and licensing procedures for\nRFIs; draft rules and regulations to regulate and supervise RFIs; and formulate guidelines,\noperational  procedures,  and  standards  for  off-site  and  on-site  inspection,  supervision,  and\nreporting for the rural finance sector.\n3. Improving Legal Enforcement Capacity and Infrastructure\n81. Enforcing Nepal\u2019s legal system is a key challenge. In a dynamic environment with\nchanging laws and rules, judges, attorneys, and other members of the legal profession need to\nkeep abreast of latest developments. There is also need for an institutional environment that\nsupports transparency as well as rapid and fair enforcement. Under loan component B, the\nproposed  Project  will  support  the  (i)  establishment  of  NJA,  (ii)  improvement  of  the  legal\ninformation system, (iii) establishment of a secured transactions registry, and (iv) establishment\nof a special commercial bench.\na. National Judicial Academy\n82. A  strong  consensus  has  emerged  from  three  major  stakeholders  (the  judiciary,\ngovernment lawyers, and the bar) in Nepal for establishing a single training academy that will\ncater to the needs of the whole legal community. Given the small size of each group of\nstakeholders, and the lack of financial and human resources, this was considered the optimal\nsolution  for  Nepal.  The  stakeholders  agree  that  the  NJA  should  be  an  independent  and\nautonomous body established by statute and the governing council chaired by the Chief Justice,\nand that the existing Judicial Training Center be merged with the NJA.\n83. The  mandate  of  the  NJA  will  be  to  conduct  programs  for  continuing  professional\neducation, training, and development for judges, court officers, officers exercising quasi-judicial\npowers, public sector legal officers, and members of the private legal profession. To consolidate\nthe independence and integrity of the judiciary, judges will be trained by judges. Lawyers will be\ntrained by lawyers, academics, or judges as required and practicable. The education program\nwill be designed to provide practical, rather than theoretical, training relevant to judicial and\nlegal officers in their day-to-day duties. The NJA may also offer theoretical courses in new areas\nof law, particularly in the commercial area. This training will focus on substantive law and\nprocedure, forensic skills, judicial management and administration, professional responsibility,\nand relevant interdisciplinary subjects. Training will be provided at the pre-service (orientation)\nand in-service (continuing) levels, mainly through programs of conferences, seminars, and\nworkshops; and programs of publishing bench books, practice manuals, digests, and bulletins.\n84. The NJA will strengthen the capacity of the judiciary to develop and improve judicial\npolicies and administration by giving it the role to review and propose developments to improve\ncase  management  and  judicial  administration  practices  and  procedures,  particularly  in\ncommercial law; and to provide training to support these improvements. Particular attention will\nbe given to strengthening judicial capacity to resolve commercial disputes expeditiously by\nestablishing a commercial bench in an existing court. The NJA may also incorporate and\ndevelop the collection of the Central Law Library, and will provide research and development\nservices to the legal community. A draft Policy and Mandate of the Academy, together with an\norganization chart, is presented in Appendix 3.", "22\n85. A draft National Judicial Academy Bill has been formulated. The NJA will regularly report\nto and coordinate with the Judicial Council, a constitutional body charged with appointment and\ndiscipline of judges, to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of its training activities in raising\nthe competence and professional performance of judges. It will similarly coordinate with the\nJudicial Services Commission, a body that appoints and disciplines government lawyers; and\nthe Bar Council, a statutory body for regulation of the legal profession, to link training to raising\ncompetence and performance of Government lawyers and private practitioners, respectively.\n86. Under  loan  component  B,  the  Project  will  support  the  establishment  and\noperationalization of the NJA by financing its building, equipment, development of its curriculum,\nteaching materials, and faculty development. The Project will also support development of\nbench books, practice manuals, and other relevant publications. The initial project phase will\ninclude finalization of a detailed needs assessment for the NJA, strategy plan and curriculum,\nestablishment plan, and operational budgets, as well as construction of the building. The Project\nwill also assist in selecting a cadre of trainers, and will design/conduct the faculty development\ninduction  program  including  an  overseas  study  tour  and  train-the-trainer  workshops,  and\ncollaborate with the Judicial Council in setting bench work performance standards.\n87. On  completion  of  construction  of  the  NJA  building,  the  Project  will  support  the\ncommencement of the operational phase, including an 18-month placement at the NJA of a\nconsultant  acting  as  counselor  to  senior  staff,  specifically  developing  and  launching  pilot\ncourses, and commissioning and producing new publications. On completion of this placement,\nthe consultant will support the NJA with two quarterly visits of two weeks each in the second\nyear of operations, and two half-yearly visits of two weeks each in the third year\nb. Legal Information\n88. Under loan component B, the capacity of the Nepal Law Books Management Board\n(NLBMB) within the Ministry of Law & Justice will be expanded to improve access to legal\ninformation and reduce information cost. In the initial Project phase, NLBMB\u2019s capacity to serve\nas a central repository of all laws will be enhanced. NLBMB will develop web-based publishing\nof the laws of Nepal, giving priority to the statutes, and in the later phases to important new\ncases  of  the  Supreme  Court  and  pre-existing  cases.  ADB  will  also  finance  web-based\npublishing of the statute laws and case laws of Nepal, equipment, and training to enable\nNLBMB to publish all the laws of Nepal in a timely fashion on the web, as well as in hard copy.\nc. Secured Transactions Registry\n89. Under  loan  component  B,  the  Project  will  support  the  establishment  of  a  secured\ntransactions registry (STR) to allow collateralization of movable assets and provide relevant\ninformation  to  the  financial  community,  including  recommendation  on  legal  status  and\nownership;  development  of  information  systems  infrastructure  as  well  as  business  and\noperational  plans:  organization,  financing,  administration,  and  staffing.  The  drafting  of  the\nsecured transactions law under TA 3461 will be a condition for establishment of the STR. The\nproposed loan will finance establishment of the registry procurement of hardware for a modern\nautomated registry and staff training.\nd. Special Commercial Bench\n90. Most stakeholders have expressed the need for a special court to deal with commercial\ncases. The Supreme Court has also recognized this need for special treatment of such cases in", "23\na recent report. Under loan component B, the Supreme Court will be given assistance in\nestablishing a special bench for commercial cases, delineating its jurisdiction, and drafting of its\nprocedural rules.\n4. Improving Infrastructure for Payments and Financial Service Delivery\n91. The development of Nepal\u2019s financial sector is hampered by its poor and unreliable\ncommunication infrastructure. The regulatory and technological infrastructure must be improved\nto support an efficient payment system as the backbone of financial service delivery. This is\nessential to increase competition in financial services, as the cost of information and transaction\ncosts, including those for operating bank branches, can be cut down significantly through\nadequate ICT. This is particularly important for a country such as Nepal, which has a generally\npoor transport system and mountain communities that have traditionally been cut off from each\nother. ICT will also support documentation of the economy.\na. Upgrading of Payments System\n92. To improve financial service delivery and competition under TA4 of the TA cluster, the\nProject will assist NRB to upgrade Nepal\u2019s payment system. The assistance will assess the\ncurrent financial service delivery system and identify gaps between the current capacity of the\npayment system and the requirements of the growing financial and real sectors. It will examine\nthe current legal and policy framework, operating systems, institutional capacity, information\ntechnology, and existing and required staff skills. It will formulate recommendations for an\nappropriate institutional environment, including the necessity of establishing a Nepal Payment\nAssociation, and draft regulations as required. It will further develop an implementation plan with\na practical timetable for a medium term upgrade of Nepal\u2019s payment system that will meet the\nneeds of businesses, consumers, and financial institutions to transfer funds. The project will\nalso assist in putting in place effective safeguards in line with international best practices in\npreventing money laundering.\nb. Support of Institutional Infrastructure for ICT Investments in\nFinancial Service Delivery\n93. A low technological base and poor communication facilities make financial transactions\ncostly and nontransparent. In particular, the absence of a reliable and secure ICT backbone for\ntransmission of financial information makes branch operations more costly, and thus hampers\ncompetition. The eventual investment in ICT technology and infrastructure will require extensive\npreparation and will be carried out under a separate stand-alone project preparatory technical\nassistance (PPTA).18 This will help define and improve the institutional and policy environment\nto support the investment, as well as in costing the investment requirements.\n94. To ensure the reliability and data security of the financial services network and to attract\nprivate sector investment to this area, it is important that the ICT backbone be operated and\nmanaged by a competent institution.  Under the Project, it is expected that future investment in\nICT  for  financial  sector  delivery  will  be  channeled  through  a  public-private  joint-venture\ncompany, which will provide a high-quality wireless data transmission backbone network for\nfinancial information and transactions on a commercial basis. A joint-venture company will help\nbundling resources to exploit economies of scale in providing a large bandwidth, and the cost-\nefficiencies of a common transmission channel for diverse banking services.\n                  \n18TA for ICT for Improved Financial Service Delivery, for $500,000, proposed for approval.", "24\n95. Private sector participation for this will be required as HMGN, with its limited resource, is\nunlikely to respond to the market needs in this respect. HGMN participation is required to\nensure policy consistency, as a number of government institutions are currently involved in ICT\naffairs.  In  this  regard,  HMGN  agreed  to  support  an  appropriate  institutional  coordination\nmechanism and to protect the frequency spectrum band for the electronic transmission of\ninformation. HMGN will also the support the establishment of the public-private joint-venture\ncompany to manage this. The domestic banking industry has been consulted on this matter and\nexpressed  very  strong  support  for  such  initiative.  To  operationalize  such  a  joint-venture\ncompany, which is expected as an outcome of the PPTA, funding will be required for the initial\nstart-up activities.\n96. Under loan component C, the Project will provide a portion of the loan proceeds ($1\nmillion)  to  assist  in  the  start-up  funding  of  a  public-private  ICT  company  (e-FIT),  to  be\nestablished as the outcome of the PPTA. The funds will cover immediate financing needs for\nsetting up the institution: key personnel, operational and organizational development, as well as\ntraining, marketing, and human resource development. The loan will only be provided if the\nviability of the project is confirmed, and sufficient private sector interest is forthcoming and a\nshareholder  agreement  concluded.  Future  investment  in  hardware  and  software  for  the\nestablishment of the ICT backbone will only be considered once the appropriate institutional\ninfrastructure, including setting up of e-FIT, has been established. The preparedness to provide\na start-up loan to e-FIT also signals a strong commitment by HMGN to this initiative and will be\nessential if the private sector is to come forward.\n5. Restructuring and Development of Selected Financial Intermediaries\na. Diagnostic Study of ADBN and NIDC\n97. Nepal\u2019s financial institutions such as ADBN and NIDC face a severe crisis that needs to\nbe resolved. Institutional strengthening measures at this stage will have little impact and will\nrequire further improvement in the operating environment. But given the importance of these\ninstitutions in the financial sector, some basic analytical work for reforming them will need to be\ninitiated. This will complement the work initiated by the World Bank on the reform of the public\nsector commercial banks.\n98. Under TA5 of the TA cluster, ADB will support a review of the role of these institutions\nwithin the economy and an assessment of their financial health, governance structures, and\nmanagement strengths and weaknesses. Specifically, assistance will be provided to conduct a\ndetailed audit of both institutions and present an option study for their future direction.\nb. Development of Insurance and Contractual Savings\n99. Deepening and broadening the financial sector require orderly growth and expansion of\ninsurance, pension, and other forms of contractual savings. This growth necessitates a sound\nregulatory environment under a legal framework, and strengthening the capacity of regulatory\norganizations  for  prudential  supervision  and  protection\u2019s  of  investors  and  policyholders  in\nrelation to sophisticated financial products.\n100. Under TA6 of the TA cluster, the Project will support the development of an appropriate\ninstitutional  and  policy  framework  for  regulating  insurance,  pension,  and  other  types  of\ncontractual  savings  including  investment  trust,  so  as  to  broaden  the  financial  sector  and", "25\nincrease the growth of insurance, pension, and provident funds. It will also assess the existing\ninstitutions operating in the subsector, e.g., the National Insurance Corporation and Employees\nProvident Fund, and formulate recommendations for their institutional development.\nC. Cost Estimates\n101.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at about $13.3 million equivalent, including\nphysical and price contingencies and taxes and duties. The total foreign exchange cost is about\n$7.9 million (59 percent of the project cost), primarily for services of international consultants\nand ICT equipment. The local currency cost is about $5.4 million equivalent (41 percent of the\nproject cost), primarily for domestic consultant inputs, minor civil works as well as taxes and\nduties. The Project cost estimates are summarized in Table 2, and details are in Appendix 4.\nTable 2: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nItem Foreign   Local   Total\nExchange Currency Cost\nA.

Financing Plan\n102. A loan in various currencies of about $7.3 million equivalent is proposed from ADB\u2019s\nSpecial Funds resources to finance the consultant and procurement packages under sub-\ncomponents 2(a) and 3, as well as onlending under subcomponent 4(b). The loan will carry a\nterm of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1 percent per\nannum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter. The Borrower will be the\nKingdom of Nepal. In addition, a grant of $3.3 million equivalent from the ADB-funded TA\nProgram is proposed to finance a cluster of various TA activities under assistance areas 1,\n2(b), 4(a), and 5 (Table 1). ADB will finance the entire foreign exchange cost of the Project, as\nwell as a portion of the local currency cost. Total financing by ADB is about 79.2 percent of the\ntotal Project cost. It is 78.1 percent for the loan-financed component and 84.5 percent for the\ngrant-financed component. A summary of the financing plan is in Table 3, with details in\nAppendix 5.\nTable 3: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nSource Foreign Local   Total Percent\nExchange Currency Cost\nAsian Development Bank Loan 5.1 2.2 7.3  54.9\nAsian Development Bank Grant\n(TA cluster)  2.8 0.5 3.3 24.8\nGovernment 0.0 2.7 2.7 20.3\nTotal 7.9 5.4 13.3 100.0\n103. The Government has requested partial financing of local currency expenditures as well\nas grant financing which is considered necessary in view of the Government\u2019s limited capacity\nto generate internal resources to meet all expenditure requirements, and the high consultant\ninputs required for capacity building. Nepal has one of the lowest ratios of tax collection to GDP\n(about 8 percent of GDP) among ADB\u2019s member countries, but it recently introduced a number\nof reforms and initiatives to improve this situation, which will further be reinforced by the\nProject. Moreover, grant financing through the ADB-funded TA Program does allow for greater\nflexibility in project implementation. The Government will finance about $2.7 million equivalent\nof the local currency cost, including provision of land for the National Judicial Academy.\nE. Implementation Arrangements\n104. Effective  implementation  arrangements  are  crucial  for  the  ultimate  success  and\ndevelopment impact of the Project. For maximum project impact, the implementation arrangements\nwill be structured along three guiding principles:\n(i)  minimize administrative burden for the Executing Agency (EA) and Implementing\nAgencies (IAs);\n(ii)  maximize sense of project ownership by skills transfer to IAs; and\n(iii)  maximize accountability and minimize scope for misuse of funds.", "27\n1. Project Organization\n105. MOF as EA will be responsible for overall coordination of the project activities. MOF will\nadminister the loan proceeds monitor their utilization, and interface with ADB and the IAs on\nproject administration matters. MOF will also follow up on reporting requirements to monitor\nimplementation  progress.  MOF  will  regularly  (and  at  least  on  a  quarterly  basis)  convene\nmeetings of the project steering committee which includes private sector representatives, to\nreview overall progress in implementation and to seek shareholder feedback.19 To ensure\ndissemination of information on the reform process and discussion among stakeholders and aid\nsources, a project web site was established (www.neat.net.np) and will be updated regularly to\nensure proper integration in HMGN\u2019s overall reform program for the financial sector.\n106. To perform its functions as EA, MOF will nominate a senior official as project director,\nwho  will  be  supported  by  administrative  staff  to  function  as  the  project  coordination  and\nmonitoring unit (PCMU). Given the modular structure of the Project, which has only limited\nprocurement  and  other  administrative  requirements,  while  operational  interaction  with  the\nconsultants will be performed by the IAs, it is expected that involvement of PCMU will be\nminimal, and more of a periodic nature. The role of EA is above all one of coordination,\noversight, and accountability. It is expected that staff resources for this can be allocated among\nexisting MOF staff, with operational support from the TA on financial sector reform (footnote 3).\n107. To ensure a strong sense of project ownership and skills transfer to the IAs who are the\ndirect beneficiaries of the assistance, close interaction between the consultants and key staff in\nthe IAs is important. This requires close involvement of the IAs in consultant selection, effective\noperational interaction, and provision of an adequate working environment.\n108. To formalize the working and reporting relationships between the IAs and PCMU, a\nproject implementation team will be formed for each project component related to corporate\ngovernance and capital markets (component A) and NJA and legal strengthening (component\nB). Each team will be headed by a senior official as the team leader who should be a member of\nthe  steering  committee,  as  well  as  senior  officials  from  the  other  IAs  involved  in  project\nimplementation. For component A, these will be SEBO, NEPSE, and CRO. For component B,\nthese will be the Supreme Court and Ministry of Law and Justice.\n109. Specifically, the project implementation teams will:\n(i)  lead the consultant selection process for the respective components, including\npreparation of a long list, shortlist, and selection criteria;\n(ii)  interact with the consulting teams to produce outputs as agreed;\n(iii)  monitor  resource  inputs,  including  verifying  consultant  timesheets  and\nwithdrawals from the imprest account for eligible project activities; and\n(iv)  prepare progress implementation reports to be submitted to PCMU for wider\ndistribution.\n110. As is the case for the PCMU, required staff resources will come from the existing staff of\nthe IAs. For handling administrative matters related to the activities outlined above and to\n                  \n19 The steering committee was established in January 2000 with private sector participation. Regular consultation\nbetween the Government and the private sector initiated during the design and processing phase of this Project will\nbe extended to the implementation phase of the Project. Subcommittees have been formed to provide guidance\nand stakeholder consultation on policy matters.", "28\nperform as secretary to the respective project implementation teams, SEBO and the Supreme\nCourt will each assign one of its staff. ADB will familiarize this staff with ADB\u2019s procurement,\ndisbursement, and reporting requirements.\n111. For the TA components, the respective line ministries will be the IAs and will report\nimplementation  progress  to  the  steering  committee.  An  organization  chart  outlining  project\nimplementation and coordination arrangements is in Appendix 6.\n2. Implementation Schedule\n112. The Project will be implemented over 48 months from loan effectiveness, starting in\nearly 2001 with completion by December 2004. Initial activities will focus on selection and\nrecruitment  of  loan  consultants  for  the  two  components  covered.  The  overall  project\nimplementation  schedule  is  summarized  in  Appendix  7.  The  implementation  schedule  and\narrangements will be reviewed and details provided after the consultants are fielded.\n3. Procurement of Goods and Services\n113. Procurement  of  goods  and  services  out  of  the  loan  proceeds  will  follow  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement. Supply contracts for equipment and materials will generally be\nawarded on international competitive bidding for packages with over $500,000 aggregate value,\ninternational shopping for packages costing over $100,000, and local competitive bidding or\nlocal shopping, in accordance with procedures acceptable to ADB, for other items, except minor\nitems for which off-the-shelf purchases will be permitted. Computer hardware and software,\nincluding  software  development,  will  be  procured  under  the  contract  with  the  consultants\nselected under loan components A and B, in accordance with ADB procedures. Any civil works\nfinanced under the loan for establishing NJA in loan component B will be for a turnkey contract\non a local competitive basis as the cost is less than $5 million. A procurement selection\ncommittee will choose the contractor.\n114. MOF and the IAs will ensure that goods and services procured are reasonably priced\nand suitable for the project activities, and that fair canvassing is done and normal commercial\npractices are followed in selecting suppliers in the case of international or local shopping.\nBefore procuring any goods and services, the EA will submit to ADB for its concurrence a list of\nequipment, quotations obtained from at least three suppliers (for international shopping from at\nleast two ADB member countries), and justification for selection.\n115. The loan will finance of consulting services for policy advice, institutional development\nand training, preparation of ICT solutions, and project management. It is estimated that about\n87 person-months of international and 152 person-months of domestic consulting services will\nbe required. Consultants will be recruited in two bidding packages for loan components A and\nB, in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB for engagement of domestic consultants. The required expertise and outline\nterms of reference are attached as Appendix 8.\n4. Disbursement Procedures\n116. Immediately after loan effectiveness, the EA will establish an imprest fund account for\ndisbursement of the loan proceeds. The IAs will use the account to pay suppliers of minor items\nas well as organizers of workshops and for attendance at training events under the Project. The\nimprest account will be operated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.", "29\nAdvances  to  the  imprest  account  will  be  based  on  MOF\u2019s  projected  expenditures.  ADB\u2019s\nstatement of expenditure procedures will be used to liquidate advances and replenish the\nimprest account. Payment for consulting services and computer equipment, including software\ndevelopment contracts, as well as civil works will follow ADB\u2019s direct payment procedures. This\nwill minimize the administrative burden on the EA and IAs. The Government contribution to the\nProject will be provided through the annual budget process and in a project account.\n5. Relending Arrangements\n117. Under a subsidiary loan agreement, the Borrower will relend up to $1 million of the loan\nrelating to the public-private sector joint-venture company to be established under the Project\nfor operating the ICT infrastructure (component C). The proceeds will finance start-up costs\nincluding key personnel, operational and organizational development, as well as training and\nsocial mobilization needs. The subsidiary loan agreement with the joint-venture company will be\ndenominated in Nepalese rupees with a maturity of up to seven years including a grace period\nof up to three years. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by HMGN as the Project is\nexpected to generate revenues in local currency only. The rate of interest for the re-lent portion\nwill not be less than that applicable to loans from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources.\n6. Reports and Reviews\n118. To ensure proper monitoring of fund utilization and effective progress in implementation,\nimplementation  teams  will  submit  regular  reports  to  PCMU  for  wider  distribution  among\nstakeholders. MOF will submit to ADB quarterly progress reports on overall progress in project\nimplementation in line with the project framework and in a form and level of detail satisfactory to\nADB. The quarterly progress report will be submitted to ADB within four weeks after the end of\nthe relevant quarter. Within three months of substantial project completion, MOF will prepare\nand submit to ADB a project completion report. ADB and HMGN will jointly conduct review\nmissions  at  least  twice  a  year.  A  project  inception  mission  will  take  place  after  loan\neffectiveness to ensure that delays during the start-up phase are avoided. A comprehensive\nmidterm  review  18  months  after  project  inception  will  examine  all  aspects  of  project\nimplementation.  The  review  will  focus  on  (i)  the  performance  of  the  EA  and  IAs,  and\ncoordination issues; (ii) the performance of the consultants; (iii) progress in disbursement and\nadequacy of implementation arrangements; (iv) policy constraints in project implementation; and\n(v)  initial  project  impact.  In  addition,  feedback  from  beneficiaries  will  be  sought  through\noccasional workshops and regular meetings of the project steering committee.\n7. Accounts and Audit\n119. MOF and the IAs will establish and maintain separate accounts for expenditures under\nthe  Project  in  accordance  with  accounting  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  All  financial\ntransactions will be recorded in the project account in a manner that allows identification of\nexpenditures on the project facilities provided under the loan.\n120. The financial statements by MOF and the IAs on the use of loan proceeds will be\naudited annually by an accounting firm acceptable to ADB. Certified copies of the audited\naccounts and financial statements will be submitted to ADB in the English language within six\nmonths after the end of each fiscal year.  Any delay in submission of such audited accounts and\nfinancial statements may result in suspension or cancellation of the loan.", "30\n8. Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n121. To ensure effective utilization of the funds and adequate development impact, including\nskills transfer, performance parameters will be established for the key agencies benefiting from\nthe  capacity  building  components.  They  will  be  monitored  annually.  A  set  of  detailed\nperformance criteria is in Appendix 9.\n122.  Throughout the life of the Project, civil society, as representatives of the consumers and\npotential consumers of judicial and legal services, will be consulted to assess public confidence\nin the quality of service provision, need for professional development, and effectiveness of\ntraining provided.\n123. Progress in implementing this program will be independently monitored and evaluated at\nthe completion of the first, second, and third years of operation, in addition to regular reporting\nto and liaising with the Judicial Council, the Judicial Services Commission, and the Nepal Bar\nCouncil,  to  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  education  services  in  improving  the  professional\ncompetence and performance of judges, government lawyers, and private practitioners.\n124. With specific reference to judges, a performance management system will be introduced\nin  liaison  with  the  Judicial  Council  to  implement  and  monitor  bench  work  performance\nstandards, as part of a related merit-based approach to judicial appointment being introduced\nby  the  Judicial  Council  under  powers  invested  by  the  Constitution.  Similar  performance\nmanagement systems will be introduced in the Judicial Services Commission and the Nepal Bar\nCouncil  to  monitor  improvements  in  the  performance  of  government  lawyers  and  private\npractitioners, respectively.\n125. Key performance parameters for other agencies benefiting from assistance under the TA\ncluster will be established at the beginning of each TA, depending on the scope of NRB\u2019s\nmandate in this area after revision of the NRB Act. For example, for ICAN, performance may be\nmonitored annually against key criteria such as (i) progress in implementing its business plan,\n(ii) increases in application for membership, (iii) number of accountants trained and training\ncourses offered, (iv) output of the proposed accounting and auditing standards boards, and (v)\nthe activity level of its disciplinary committee.\n126. Continued feedback and participation by the private sector and other beneficiaries will\nbe sought throughout implementation. For this purpose workshops and stakeholder forums will\nbe organized.\nF. The Executing Agency\n127. The EA will be MOF, through its Economic Affairs Division. MOF and NRB are the key\nagencies involved in the financial sector reform program in Nepal.  MOF has considerable\nexperience with administering ADB and other externally funded projects. Currently, it is EA for\nTA 3356 for strengthening the accounting and auditing profession (footnote 2). MOF will be\nsupported by NRB, SEBO, Ministry of Industry (MOI), Ministry of Law and Justice, Supreme\nCourt, and Ministry of Information and Communication (MOIC) as IAs. While NRB, MOI, and\nMOIC have reasonable experience in implementing externally funded projects, the experience\nof SEBO and the Supreme Court is limited. However, SEBO has performed well as the EA for\nTA 2834 for capital markets development. Due to MOF\u2019s many ongoing commitments and the\ncomplex nature of the Project, institutional support has been provided under TA 3371 (footnote\n3) to assist MOF with the wider scope and responsibilities under the Project.", "31\nG. Environmental and Social Measures\n128. The Project will have no direct environmental impact; therefore no mitigating measures\nare required. Longer term environmental and social impacts will result from a general increase\nin living standards, and more open communication and access to information. Expected social\nimpacts are discussed in paras. 131-134.\nH. Technical Assistance\n129. For assistance in implementing, on an urgent basis, the key measures related to policy\nreforms and transparency of the legal framework; improving accounting and auditing standards\nin the public sector; strengthening NRB to regulate and supervise rural finance; upgrading the\npayment system; and developing selected market participants, including ADBN and NIDC, the\nGovernment requested an umbrella TA for Corporate and Financial Governance Institutional\nSupport, with sub-TAs, under ADB\u2019s cluster modality for a total amount of $3.3 million on a\ngrant basis from the ADB-funded TA Program. Specifically, the proposed TA will comprise the\nfollowing:\n(i)  TA1:  Streamlining  of  Financial,  Corporate  and  Commercial  Legislation\n($250,000);\n(ii)  TA2:  Improved  Accounting  and  Auditing  Standards  in  the  Public  Sector\n($250,000)\n(iii)  TA3: Institutional Strengthening of NRB for Regulation and Supervision of Rural\nFinance ($800,000)\n(iv)  TA4: Development of Nepal\u2019s Payment System ($400,000)\n(v)  TA5: Financial and Operational Review of ADBN and NIDC ($850,000); and\n(vi)  TA6: Development of Insurance, Pensions, and Contractual Savings ($750,000).\n130. Detailed scope and implementation arrangements will be finalized before the start of\neach subproject, based on the outlined scope and indicative budget, and will be subject to close\nscrutiny prior to approval by ADB\u2019s Management. Upon the start of implementation of each sub-\nproject,  ADB\u2019s  Board  will  be  informed  of  overall  progress  of  the  cluster  through  a  brief\ninformation paper. The objectives, scope, and terms of reference for the six sub-TAs are\noutlined in Appendix 10.\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA. Poverty Reduction and Socioeconomic Impact\n131. The Project will reinforce the basic fundamentals for a robust and efficient financial\nsector. It will increase transparency, accountability, and better governance standards as well as\nlaw enforcement. More reliable financial information to the public will reduce the scope for rent-\nseeking opportunities of individuals through a monopoly of information at the expense of the\nlarger society. Access to information and justice is often excessively priced for the poorest\nsegment of the population. Initial work for upgrading the payments systems and creating the\nenabling environment for development of ICT infrastructure will promote competition and further\ngrowth in service delivery. It will also include measures to prevent money laundering.", "32\n132. A better regulatory and institutional framework will also increase stability of the financial\nsystem and make it more robust against any financial crisis. This will reduce the risk of a\nnegative socioeconomic impact associated with a financial crisis, which is most severe for the\npoorest segment of the population.\n133. The Project is part of a longer term development process for private and financial sector\ndevelopment. A computable general equilibrium model as well as international comparison with\nother reform countries indicates that comprehensive financial sector reform will boost Nepal\u2019s\nannual  gross  domestic  product  growth  by  about  2  percent  \u2013  or  $100  million  per  annum.\nImportantly, growth will be even stronger in rural areas as any ensuing investment will raise the\ndemand for rural labor, especially in the most labor-intensive activities.\n134. The Project supports primarily regulatory and institutional development and has limited\ndirect impact on individual beneficiaries. In a wider sense, changes in Nepal\u2019s social fabric are\nexpected over the longer term as economic growth and more transparency in information result\nfrom the Project. The shift toward more formal economic patterns and industrialization following\nimproved  financial  intermediation  are  often  accompanied  by  increasing  urbanization  and\nassociated  social  implications,  including  social  protection  patterns.  The  Project  includes\npreparatory  work  for  future  investments  in  ICT,  which  will,  in  the  longer  term,  support\nintroduction  of  e-banking  and  e-commerce.  The  longer  term  social  impacts  of  internet\ntechnology in particularly for remote societies are not yet well known. Additional work is needed\nto better understand how the benefits of new IT applications can best be put to use in SMEs\nand other low-income customers, and its social implications. Initial research findings suggest\nthat, in some cases, this can lead to disruption of long-standing power structures and traditional\npatterns, particularly for hierarchical societies. 20\nB. Risks\n135. Policy reversal and loss of momentum. The principal risk associated with the Project\nis that of policy reversal. To bring about sustained improvement, a long-term vision and strong\ncommitment to reform and development in a number of areas are required. Although the\nGovernment has expressed a clear commitment to comprehensive reform, the political situation\nis fragile and any measures that cut the existing privileges of selected groups are subject to\npolitical exploitation. Moreover, many benefits of the project initiatives may only occur in the\nmedium  to  longer  term  and  enthusiasm  for  the  reform  process  may  fade.  An  active\ncommunications strategy will be pursued, including a series of consultative workshops to muster\nwider stakeholder support. In addition, the inclusion of private sector representatives in the\nproject steering committee makes the Project less vulnerable to changes in Government.\n136. Limited  implementation  capacity.  The  Project  covers  a  wide  range  of  activities\ninvolving  a  number  of  IAs.  However,  given  the  multidimensional  aspect  of  financial  and\ncorporate governance, developing of a sustainable financial system needs a holistic approach\nwith proper sequencing and a realistic time frame over a longer term than in the project horizon.\nTo ensure proper coordination and implementation, TA 3371 (footnote 3) is assisting MOF in\neffectively  coordinating  and  monitoring  financial  sector  reforms,  as  well  as  organizing\nconsultative workshops for continued feedback. An internet web site has been created to keep\nall parties updated on progress and developments under the Project. Beneficiaries have been\ninvolved from an early stage in project design and a steering committee with adequately staffed\n                  \n20  See New York Times, When Villages Go Global \u2013 How a Byte of Knowledge Can Be Dangerous, too; 23 April\n2000.", "33\nspecialized subcommittees has been created. In addition, ADB will conduct at least two annual\nreview missions.\n137. Effective skills transfer by consultants. The institutional capacity in Nepal\u2019s financial\nsector is extremely weak and expertise available domestically is limited. Capacity building, one\nof the key project outputs, requires significant consultant inputs. The consulting expertise will be\nprimarily  for  hands-on  work  in  establishing  systems,  rules  and  procedures,  as  well  as\ntransferring knowledge to local counterparts, and only to a lesser extent for additional studies\nand  review.  Clear  performance  measurement  standards  have  been  established  to  ensure\nmeasurable progress.\n138. Delays in establishing the public/private partnership company (eFIT). The Project\nenvisages  onlending  to  a  public-private  joint-venture  company  with  majority  private  sector\nparticipation that is still to be established. The Government has assured its full support to this\nventure and a PPTA has detailed the investment parameters (footnote 18). The loan component\nfor this will be disbursed only if sufficient investor interest is mustered and due diligence carried\nout on the financial sustainability of the proposed company.\nVI.  ASSURANCES\nA. Specific Assurances\n139. HMGN has given the following assurances, in addition to the standard assurances,\nwhich have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i)  By 30 June 2001, submission to Parliament of the following proposed legislation,\nacceptable to ADB: (a) Securities Bill, (b) Companies Bill, (c) Insolvency Bill,  (d)\nSecured Transactions Bill, (e) a bill to amend the Nepal Chartered Accountants\nAct, and (f) NJA Bill. Old legislation covering these areas will be repealed, as\nnecessary.\n(ii)  By  31  December  2001,  submission  to  Parliament  of  the  following  proposed\nlegislation, acceptable to ADB: (a) NRB Bill, (b) Financial Institutions Bill (or a bill\nserving similar purpose), and (c) e-commerce Bill, each in a form acceptable to\nthe Bank. Old legislation covering these areas will be repealed, as necessary.\n(iii)  HMGN will issue a gazette notification to bring into force the Judicial Fund Act\n1986 so that the Fund can, among other things, be used for developing the\njudiciary, including training requirements, to ensure sustainability of the NJA.\n(iv)  Institutional and organizational arrangements for regulation of companies will be\nrationalized, including possible merger or reorganization of SEBO, CRO, and\nCompany Law Board, on the basis of the findings under TA 3461 (footnote 2).\n(v)  Interest rates and branch licensing policies will be rationalized, and priority and\ndirected credit sector lending requirements reviewed by 30 June 2001.\n(vi)  By 31 December 2002, finalize fair tax treatment based on certified accounts that\ngives minimal discretionary powers to income tax officials for companies that\nsubmit  themselves  to  higher  disclosure  requirements,  including  an  audit  of", "34\naccounts  through  chartered  accountants  who  are  members  of  ICAN,  and\nsupervision by SEBO.\n(vii)  Ownership of and control over NEPSE will be transferred to the private sector by\n31 December 2002.\n(viii)  The NJA will be established under the auspices of the Supreme Court and\nbudgetary allocation for the judiciary will gradually be increased.\n(ix)  The  Nepal  Payments  Association  will  be  created,  or  alternative  institutional\narrangements  as  recommended  under  the  TA  cluster  will  be  adopted,  to\ncoordinate development of the payments system, electronic funds transfer, and\nclearing and settlement under supervision of NRB, in coordination with the Nepal\nBankers\u2019 Association.\n(x)  The radio frequency spectrum band for electronic transmission of information\nthrough the financial very small aperture terminal communication network will be\nprotected.\n(xi)  The Government will support the establishment of a public-private joint-venture\ncompany - if found viable - to establish, operate, and maintain the ICT network\nand services.\nB. Conditions for Loan Effectiveness\n140. The Project will be declared effective when Cabinet:\n(i)  approves tabling of the Nepal Chartered Accountants Bill, acceptable to ADB,\nthat would, among others, lead to the repeal of the Auditors Act - thus allowing\nICAN to be the sole licensing body for accountants - and establishment of the\naccounting and auditing standards boards, and\n(ii)  approves  tabling  in  Parliament  a  Securities  Bill,  acceptable  to  ADB,  that\nestablishes an independent SEBO, thus granting security of tenure to members\nof SEBO and allows their removal only for just cause after due process. The draft\nwill also ensure the financial autonomy of SEBO by allowing registration and\nother fees levied by SEBO to accrue to the SEBO fund. The bill will provide for\ninvestigation and enforcement of the Securities Law including the establishment\nof the office of the chief accountant in SEBO, headed by a chartered accountant.\nC. Conditions for Disbursement\n141. The following will be conditions for disbursement of the loan for the Project:\n(i)  Funds under component B (National Judicial Academy) will be disbursed only\nwhen the Cabinet approves tabling in Parliament of a bill, acceptable to ADB, for\nestablishing the NJA, and after an adequate plot of land within Kathmandu valley\nhas been allocated for the NJA.", "35\n(ii)  Funds under component C (onlending to a private-public sector joint-venture [e-\nFIT]  to  provide  ICT  for  financial  services)  will  be  disbursed  only  when  a\nshareholding agreement with private sector participation for establishment of e-\nFIT has been concluded, based on a viable business plan developed under the\nPPTA for ICT for improved financial service delivery.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\n142. I am satisfied that the proposed loan and technical assistance would comply with the\nArticles of Agreement of ADB and recommend that the Board approve:\n(i)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 5,706,000 to\nthe Kingdom of Nepal for the Corporate and Financial Governance Project, with a\nterm of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an interest charge\nof 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum\nthereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in\naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the\nBoard; and\n(ii) the provision of technical assistance in an amount not exceeding the equivalent\nof  $3.3  million  to  His  Majesty\u2019s  Government  of  the  Kingdom  of  Nepal  for\nStrengthening Corporate and Financial Governance.\nTADAO CHINO\nPresident\n21 November 2000", "36\nAPPENDIXES\nNumber Title Page     Cited on\n(page, para.)\n1 External Assistance Supporting 37   9, 28\nFinancial and Corporate Governance\n2 Project Framework 38 15,  51\n3  Draft Policy, Mandate and Organization Chart\nof the proposed National Judicial Academy 47 21,  84\n4 Cost Estimates 52 25,  101\n5 Financing Plan 53 26,  102\n6 Organization Chart 54 28,  111\n \n7 Implementation Chart 55 28,  112\n8 Outline Terms of Reference for Consulting  56 28,  115\nServices\n9 Performance Parameters for Benefit Monitoring 62 30,  121\n10 Objectives, Scope, and Terms of Reference\nfor TA Cluster 64 31,  130\nSUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIXES\n(available on request)\nA Background Note on Nepal\u2019s Financial Sector and Institutions\nB CGE Model on Welfare and Distribution Impacts of Financial Liberalization in\nNepal", "37\nAppendix 1\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE SUPPORTING\nFINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nYear Commitment\nInstitution, Project Type Approved Amount ($ \u2018000)\nADB\nCapital Market Development TA Grant 1992 187\nCapital Market Development II TA Grant 1997 596\nFinancial Sector Regulation and Governance TA Grant 1998 150\nImprovement of Disclosures and Corporate TA Grant 1998 150\nGovernance\nCapacity Building for Accounting and Auditing TA Grant 1999 665\nProfession\nEstablishing a Focal Point for Financial Sector\nReform TA Grant 1999 150\nCompany and Insolvency Law Reform TA Grant 2000 250\nWorld Bank\nSecond Structural Adjustment Credit Loan 1989 60,000\nBanking Reform Project (RBB) Grant 1999 425\nReform of Banking Regulation and\nStrengthening Supervisory Function of NRB Grant 1999 92\nProject Preparation Facility for Financial Sector\nDevelopment Program Grant 1999 550\nUNDP\nStrengthening Accounting and Auditing\nCapabilities Grant 1987 1,010\nCommercial Bank Problem Analysis and\nStrategy Study Grant 1989 950\nCommercial Bank Problem Analysis and\nStrategy Study, Phase II Grant 1992 695\nDFID\nPrivatization Project Grant 1997 3,550\nADB = Asian Development Bank, DFID = Department for International Development, NRB = Nepal Rastra Bank,\nTA = technical assistance, UNDP = United Nations Development Programme.", "38\nAppendix 2, page 1\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Performance Indicators Monitoring Mechanisms Assumptions and Risks\nand Targets\nGoal\nDeepen and broaden (cid:1) Increase the domestic (cid:1) Nepal Rastra Bank (cid:1) Continued political\nfinancial sector and investment (credit volume) (NRB) statistics for commitment to reform\nincrease efficiency of and monetized savings monitoring domestic (cid:1) Adequate human\nfinancial intermediation for (deposits) rate investment, savings, credit resources and institutional\ngrowth and equity (cid:1) Increase in liquidity of creation and stock, capacity\nfinancial instruments, deposits, liquidity, spreads (cid:1) Timely and accurate\nincluding capital markets and interest rates in the\nstatistics\nformal finance system\n(cid:1) Improve domestic\ncredit/deposits ratio and (cid:1) Securities Board (SEBO)\nincremental capital output statistics on capital market\nratio (ICOR) activities\n(cid:1) nongovernment\norganization (NGO)/private\nsector feedback\nPurpose/Objectives\n1.

Mission\n1. The mission of the National Judicial Academy is to conduct programs of continuing\nprofessional education training and development for judges, court officers, officers exercising\nquasi-judicial powers, public sector legal officers, and members of the private legal profession\n(judicial and legal officers).\nB. Objectives\n2. The purpose of the programs of continuing professional development is to improve the\nrule of law by improving the competence and performance of judicial and legal officers in\nproviding judicial and legal services. Specifically, the objectives of the Academy are to\n(i)  assist  judicial  and  legal  officers  acquire  the  knowledge,  skills,  and  attitudes\nrequired to perform their professional responsibilities competently;\n(ii)  conduct legal research and publishing;\n(iii)  provide access to legal information;\n(iv)  develop judicial policies and administration;\n(v)  promote the highest standards of personal and professional conduct and practice;\n(vi)  consolidate the integrity, efficiency, and effectiveness of the judicial and legal\nprocess; and\n(vii)  enhance public confidence in the justice system.\nC. Guiding Principles\n3. The Academy will be established as an independent and autonomous statutory body. To\npreserve the independence, integrity, and authenticity of the judiciary, the training of judges will\nbe done by judges. Lawyers will be trained by lawyers, academics, or judges as required and\npracticable.\n4. The education program will be designed and conducted to provide practical, rather than\ntheoretical,  training  relevant  for  judicial  and  legal  officers  in  their  day-to-day  duties.  The\nAcademy may also offer theoretical courses in new areas of law, particularly in the commercial\narea, and enable stakeholders that need such training to further strengthen their grounding in\nlaw.\nD. Education Services\n5. The Academy will provide a program of educational services designed to meet the needs\nfor professional development of judicial and legal officers throughout their careers. This program\nwill comprise the following elements:\n6. Content.

The core trainers train\ntrainers working in the various divisions of the AG\u2019s office.\n5. AG received assistance from the World Bank on performance audit and this assistance\nwas completed in November last year. AG at the moment is receiving no further assistance from\nother aid agencies.\n6. In  Nepal,  the  current  cash-based  accounting  standards  for  the  public  sector  are\ncompletely unsuited to the management, while the auditing practices are not clearly articulated.\nMoreover, many unrealistic \u201cauditing\u201d duties are set down in separate pieces of legislation,\nplacing inappropriate demands on auditors. For audit of Government accounts, AG applies\nstandards approved by the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).\n7. Under  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  TA  3356:  Capacity  Building  for  the  Accounting  and  Auditing\nProfession in Nepal, independent accounting and auditing standards boards will be established\nrespectively. These boards will in the first instance develop standards based on international\naccounting  (IAS) and auditing standards (IAuS) for the private sector through a participatory\nmethod.\n8. In  relation  to  international  experience,  convergence  of  public  and  private  sector\naccounting and auditing standards is accepted as the way to go. The efforts made under TA\n3356 will also establish most of the infrastructure needed for the public sector, i.e., once the\naccounting and auditing standards boards are established. In addition to their roles in private\nsector corporate accounting and auditing standards, the boards will also develop and establish\naccounting and auditing standards for the public sector. In carrying out this responsibility,\npresumption is that the financial reporting and auditing requirements of the public and private\nsectors will be consistent with one another.\n9. For  Nepal,  integrated  public  and  private  sector  efforts  in  accounting  and  auditing\nstandards in the medium to long run will greatly facilitate introduction of a consistent accounting\nand auditing system. The public sector call that its reporting should be fundamentally different\nfrom that of the private sector is difficult to justify, but transitional strategies will be required to\nmove  the  public  sector  to  a  system  based  on  full  accrual  accounting.  The  Public  Sector\nCommittee  (PSC)  of  IFAC  (International  Federation  of  Accountants)  is  issuing  accounting\nstandards for the public sector based on International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC)\nstandards.1\n                  \n1 Under TA 3356, assistance to Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nepal for accreditation with IFAC\nhas been given high priority.", "66\nAppendix 10, page 3\n10. The objective of the TA is to assist Nepal to move toward improved accounting and\nauditing standards in the public sector based on the internationally accepted convergence of\npublic and private sector accounting and auditing standards.  The TA aims to familiarize the\nproposed accounting and auditing standards boards, AG, and key public sector entities with\ninternationally accepted standards issued by PSC of IFAC, the International Auditing Practices\nCommittee (IAPC), and IASC through provision of intensive training activities. The TA will be\nused as an opportunity to allow public sector entities and auditors to commence development of\nexpertise and systems so as to upgrade their knowledge and skills for carrying out audits based\non a system of full accrual accounting, in accordance with accounting standards similar to those\napplicable in the private sector. The TA also aims to convince the public sector of the need to be\ninvolved in the standard-setting processes from the beginning.\nB. Scope\n11. The TA will concentrate on designing specific training programs and giving intensive\ntraining to staff from AG and other key public entities in acquiring knowledge of international\nstandards on accounting and auditing. To be cost-effective and to ensure consistency, it is\nrecommended  that  the  training  materials  designed  under  TA  3356  be  used  as  reference\nwhenever appropriate. The TA will assist in\n(i)  developing a transitional plan for adopting accounting and auditing standards\nbased on international best practice;\n(ii)  developing  capacity  for  adopting  new  standards  at  various  stages  of  the\ntransitional plan;\n(iii)  designing a training program and materials for training of trainers and delivery of\ncertain courses by trainers who have been trained and the Comptroller General\nof Finance;\n(iv)  developing and delivering training programs for key staff from AG and other key\npublic entities on core principles of the IASs and IAuSs;\n(v)  training key AG staff to understand the standard-setting process;\n(vi)  assisting  the  independent  accounting  and  auditing  standards  boards  to  be\nestablished, to develop accounting and auditing standards for any significant\naspects of the public sector not covered by specific private sector standards; and\n(vii)  developing  a  manual  on  public  sector  accounting  and  auditing\npractices/standards, etc.\nC. Implementation Arrangements and Consulting Services\n12. The Executing Agency will be the AG, in coordination with other agencies involved in\npublic sector accounting issues. The consulting services will be carried out over 10 months. A\nteam  of  one  international  and  one  domestic  professional  accountants  will  be  engaged  to\nundertake TA implementation. The consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with", "67\nAppendix 10, page 4\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The TA will require about 6 person-months of\ninternational consulting services and experience in international accounting/auditing standards\nand delivery of training programs; and 10 person-months of domestic consulting services in the\nsame disciplines.\nSub-TA 3: Institutional Strengthening of NRB for Regulation and Supervision of\nRural Finance ($800,000)\nA. Rationale and Objectives\n13. Over the past few years, financial intermediation activities in Nepal\u2019s rural areas have\nevolved in a poorly regulated and supervised environment. A great number of nongovernment\noffices and cooperatives mobilize and lend resources outside the regulatory environment, or\nfinancial rules and regulations are not being enforced. Limited enforcement by Nepal Rastra\nBank (NRB), which is entrusted with overall responsibility, is due to (i) insufficient institutional\ncapacity; (ii) lack of autonomy; (iii) conflicting role between ownership of and supervision of rural\nfinancial institutions (RFIs) by NRB; (iv) lack of focus, including involvement in developmental\nprograms; and (v) multiplicity of financial laws and regulations. To ensure the sustainability of\nthe sector, there is an urgent need to streamline the regulatory environment and upgrade NRB\u2019s\nenforcement capacity. The objective is to improve the regulatory framework for micro and rural\nfinance, and strengthen NRB\u2019s capacities for regulation and prudential supervision, to allow the\norderly expansion of the rural finance system.\nB. Scope\n14. The TA will assist NRB in\n(i) reviewing the prevailing policy framework as it pertains to RFIs, and rural finance\noperations of other central banks, especially those that relate to institutional\nautonomy, governance, ownership, competition, directed credit, subsidies and\nhuman  resources;  and  then  rationalize  the  legal  framework  governing  the\noperations  of  the  array  of  institutions  with  rural  finance  operations  so  as  to\neliminate gaps, ambiguities, and overlaps;\n(ii) assessing the regulation and supervision needs of RFIs, and commonality and\ndifferences in the needs of the commercial banks;\n(iii) assessing NRB\u2019s capacity for regulation, supervision, and enforcement; and then\nrecommend improvements in organization, as well as regulation and supervision\nsystems;\n(iv) developing prudential norms, information and disclosure systems, accounting,\nauditing, and licensing procedures for RFIs;  drafting of rules and regulations to\nregulate and supervise RFIs;\n(v) conducting  seminars  for  wider  consultations  on  the  policy,  regulatory,  and\nsupervisory framework;", "68\nAppendix 10, page 5\n(vi) formulating guidelines, operational procedures, and standards for off-site and on-\nsite inspection, supervision, and reporting for the rural finance sector;\n(vii) assessing  necessary  staff,  skills  and  information  technology  requirements  in\nNRB to implement the recommended regulatory and supervisory system; and\n(viii) installing basic information technology infrastructure and providing training and\nskills development to NRB staff to institutionalize the new regulatory framework.\nThis will comprise the holding of seminars for wider consultations on the policy,\nregulatory, and supervisory framework.\nC. Implementation Arrangements and Consulting Services\n15. NRB will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will form a project management unit to\ncoordinate the TA and provide logistic support. NRB will constitute a corporate and financial\ngovernance (CFG) team headed by a deputy governor, and including heads of departments\ninvolved with components of the TA. The CFG team will include senior officers (joint secretary\nor above) from the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Law and Justice,\nMinistry of Rural Development, and a member of the National Planning Commission. NRB will\nalso constitute small counterpart working groups to assist the consultants and will assign two\nfull-time graduate-level computer programmers for data analysis.\n16. An international consulting firm will implement the TA. The consultants will be selected\nand engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The TA will\nrequire about 20 person-months of international consulting services in rural finance policy;\nfinancial, legal, central banking operations; rural credit; management information systems; IT\nsystems; and institutional development; and 20 person-months of domestic consulting services\nin the same disciplines. The consulting services will be carried out over 18 months.\nSub-TA 4: Developing Nepal\u2019s Payment System ($400,000)\nA. Rationale and Objectives\n17. Nepal\u2019s weak payment system fails to provide timely financial resource and information\ntransfer, thus contributing to high transaction costs. To cut the transaction costs, a major factor\nin promoting real and financial sectors\u2019 growth, it is imperative to upgrade the payment system.\nADB\u2019s TA aims at examining the current payment system, and forming a future development\ntimetable.\n18. To improve financial service delivery, ADB intends to assist in NRB\u2019s efforts to upgrade\nNepal\u2019s payment system. The TA will (i) assess the current financial service delivery system,\nand (ii) design an implementation plan in upgrading the system to meet the needs of businesses,\nconsumers, and financial institutions to transfer funds, and help NRB with macroeconomic\nmanagement.", "69\nAppendix 10, page 6\nB. Scope\n19. The  TA  will  examine  the  current  legal  and  policy  framework,  operating  systems,\ninstitutional capacity, IT, and staff skills in key institutions (NRB Clearing House, the National\nPayments Association [NPAN], etc.) in Nepal\u2019s financial delivery system. In addition, the TA will\nidentify gaps between the current capacity of the payment system and the requirements of the\ngrowing financial and real sectors, and assess the necessity and feasibility of establishing the\nNepal Payment Association (NPA). The TA will then propose a detailed and practical timetable\nfor Nepal\u2019s payment system upgrading. The timetable should cover at least five years, and\nshould consider the social and economic cost implications for all concerned parties including\nNRB,  all  financial  institutions  involved,  and  consumers  (individuals  and  corporate  entities).\nSpecifically, the TA will\n(i)  identify the gaps between the current capacity of the payment system and the\nrequirements of the growing financial and real sectors and propose a long-term\nvision and operational plans for improvement;\n(ii)  propose  policy,  operational  guidelines,  institutional  arrangements,  human\nresource, and technical infrastructure for the NRB Clearing House and other\npossible  new  institutions,  such  as  the  National  Payments  Council  or  related\nfinancial institutions (especially those which handle credit payments);\n(iii)  assess  the  necessity  for  NPA,  and  develop  an  institutional  and  operational\nstructure if needed;\n(iv)  make  recommendations  for  upgrading  the  payment  system,  and  design  an\nimplementation timetable for the upgrading. The timetable should cover at least\nfive years, and should consider the cost implications. It should also be practical in\nNepal, given all constraints;\n(v)  detail  potential  cost  implications  for  all  concerned  parties  including  NRB,  all\nfinancial institutions involved, and consumers (individuals and corporate entities)\nat different payment system upgrading stages; and\n(vi)  train NRB Clearing House other concerned staff to prepare for system upgrading.\n20. In addition, a study tour to one developing and one developed country will be considered\nfor selected NRB Clearing House and other concerned staff to expose them to best practice in\nthe world\u2019s payment systems.\nC. Implementation Arrangements and Consulting Services\n21. NRB will be the Executing Agency, and will provide counterpart staff and office space to\nassist consultants in their duties. An international consulting firm will be engaged to implement\nthe TA. The consultants will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants. The TA will be implemented over four months. It will require nine person-months of\ninternational experience with practical knowledge of legal, policy, and operational aspects of\npayment  systems in a developed  country, as well as design  of payment  systems in developing", "70\nAppendix 10, page 7\ncountries; and 11 person-months of domestic consulting services with similar expertise and\nknowledge of financial systems.\nSub-TA 5: Financial and Operational Review of ADBN and NIDC ($850,000)\nA. Rationale and Objectives\n22. ADBN  was  established  in  1968  under  a  special  act  to  finance  agriculture  and\nagroprocessing sectors. As the country's specialized rural and agricultural lending institution, it\noperates through an extensive rural branch and office network of 657 (230 regular branches, 3\ncommercial  banking  branches,  and  424  subproject  offices).2  In  addition,  it  has  23  urban\ncommercial branches, which are primarily for deposit collection. The total savings mobilized by\nthe commercial branches as of mid-July 1997 was NRs8.64 billion (around 10 percent of the\ntotal deposits mobilized by the formal system). The rural branches do not mobilize savings; they\nonly deliver credit.\n23. ADBN is owned and controlled by the Government. Its board has representatives from\nGovernment line ministries, NRB, cooperatives, and individuals nominated by the Government.\nThe Government also appoints the chief executive (general manager), who is often changed\nwith the change in Government. ADBN has little autonomy and NRB has little control over its\nfinancial operation.\n24. A major problem of ADBN is its diffused focus. As a Government-controlled bank, it has\nimplemented many community development and subsidy-laden programs, including promotion\nof biogas, rural electrification, small irrigation development, and solar energy.3 It recruits and\nmaintains technical staff for this purpose, but operating costs for these programs have not been\ncomputed.\n25. There have been serious concerns about the financial structure and performance of\nADBN. Return on total assets has averaged less than 0.27 percent against an acceptable level\nof 4 percent, and return on net worth has averaged 5.71 percent against the acceptable level of\n14 percent.3 Financial record keeping and auditing are not of international standards. Internal\nmonitoring, evaluation, and the supervision system are weak, as is the system of appraisal and\nfollow-up on loans. It has suffered from high overdues and low recovery rates. The Rural Credit\nReview Study identified inadequate follow-up on loans as one of the main reasons for poor loan\nrecovery and stated that ADBN had not paid any visit to 43 percent of its borrowers. Poor\nrecovery,  inefficient  management,  and  proliferation  of  unsound  loans  have  rendered  the\ninstitution nonviable.\n26. During 1996/97, the total rural credit disbursed by all central banks was NRs917 million,\nwhile that disbursed by ADBN was NRs4,023 million. About 78 percent of ADBN\u2019s credit went to\ncrop production (cereal and cash crops), livestock, agro-industry, and agrimarketing. In contrast,\nthe commercial banks\u2019 loans to agriculture constitute a small proportion of their total loan\nportfolio; this proportion declined from 2.5 percent in 1992 to 1.8 percent in 1997/98. In mid-July\n                  \n2 Including the subproject offices of its Small Farmer Development Program.\n3 About 37,000 biogas plants, 75,000 small irrigation schemes (both ground and surface), 975 solar\nsystems, and 517 rural electrification projects have been installed and financed to date by ADBN.", "71\nAppendix 10, page 8\n1997 ADBN accounted for nearly 56 percent of the total rural outstanding loans (NRs13.82\nbillion). Despite its dismal position, ADBN remains by far the single largest rural lending agency\nin the formal banking system. There is a need for a detailed assessment of ADBN\u2019s financial\nsituation, outlook, and options to transform it into an effective institution that can compete on\nmarket terms.\nB. Scope\n27. The TA will provide a detailed audit of ADBN\u2019s financial position and operations, and an\noptions study for its future direction. It will\n(i) make a detailed assessment of ADBN\u2019s accounting practices and assessment of\nits financial position and performance, including loan portfolio and reserves, in\nline with international standards;\n(ii) develop a loan classification system to comply with NRB\u2019s emerging regulations;\n(iii) review ADBN\u2019s existing and potential clientele and market environment;\n(iv) conduct  an  organizational  review  and  management  audit,  including  incentive\nstructures,  governance,  human  resources  and  skills,  treasury  functions,\nbudgeting, information systems; establish requirements and recommendations to\nmeet those;\n(v) review credit policies and procedures, and develop a basic credit scoring system\nfor credit appraisal; establish credit review committees; and\n(vi) develop a strategic plan including vision, objectives, target markets, products,\nand services in a competitive environment, and list steps required to implement\nthis plan.\nC. Implementation Arrangements and Consulting Services\n28. ADBN will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will form a project management unit\nto coordinate the TA with the activities for financial sector reform, and the steering committee for\nthe Corporate and Financial Governance Project. ADBN will also provide logistic support and\ncounterpart staff to assist the consultants in their duties. An international consulting firm will be\nengaged to implement the TA. The consulting services will be carried out over 12 months. The\nconsultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants. The TA will require about 26 person-months of international consulting services in\nrural finance policy, accounting and finance, banking, rural credit, auditing, law and institutional\ndevelopment; and 30 person-months of domestic consulting services in the same disciplines,\nwith focus on accounting.", "72\nAppendix 10, page 9\nSub-TA 6: Developing Insurance, Pensions, and Contractual Savings ($750,000)\nA. TA Rationale and Objectives\n29. Deepening and broadening the financial sector require expansion and orderly growth of\ninsurance, pension, and other forms of contractual savings. A sound regulatory environment\nand strong regulatory institutions are also needed. Development of insurance and contractual\nsavings can play an important role in enforcing corporate governance provisions and enforcing\nalternative savings instruments. The TA will lay the foundation for proper regulation and policy\ndirectives as well as institutional development.\nB. Scope\n30. The  TA  has  three  components:  (i)  development  of  the  regulatory  framework,  (ii)\ndevelopment of the insurance industry, and (iii) development of pension and provident funds\nand  other  forms  of  contractual  savings  including  investment  trusts.  The  consultants  will\nundertake specific tasks under each component.\n1. Regulation of Insurance and Contractual Savings\n(i) Conduct, in close collaboration with the consultants undertaking component 2\nand 3, an overview of the current status of various forms of contracting savings in\nNepal, identifying issues related to the effective and consistent regulation of\nthese financial products.\n(ii) Based on the results of the review, recommend an appropriate institutional and\nmacro policy framework for regulating insurance, pension, and other forms of\ncontractual savings.\n(iii) Review the existing legal framework for trusts, and recommend amendments to\nfacilitate the development of contractual savings on a trust basis. This includes\nreviewing the legal and institutional bases, as well as operational and financial\nconditions  of  the  existing  collective  investment  funds  established  under  the\nSecurities Investment Trust Act.\n(iv) Explore the need for legislation to govern the provision of financial advice, and\nprovide appropriate draft legislation if necessary.\n2. Development of the Insurance Industry\n(i) Examine the performance and business practices of the insurance companies;\nidentify  issues  prevailing  in  the  industry  and,  where  appropriate,  propose\namendments to the regulatory framework to address these issues.\n(ii) Review the 1992 Nepal Insurance Act, identifying constraints or weaknesses in\nthe act, which hinder the functioning and sustainability of an effective regulatory\nsystem or the effective operation of the insurance market, propose appropriate\namendments.", "73\nAppendix 10, page 10\n(iii) On the basis of (i) and (ii), and considering the findings of component 1, propose\na suitable governance structure and prepare the corporate plan for the insurance\nregulator.\n(iv) Building  the  capacity  of  the  insurance  regulator  by  defining  the  role  and\nresponsibility of its functional wings, preparing rules and regulations, operational\nmanual, and a management information system; and developing its capacity to\nenforce regulations, etc.\n(v) Design training programs and provide on-the-job training to staff of the insurance\nregulator.\n(vi) Review  the  operational  and  financial  performance  of  the  National  Insurance\nCompany (NIC/Rastriya Beema Sansthan), assessing the value of assets and\nliabilities including its policyholder liabilities, and assessing the quality of risk\nmanagement  in  terms  of  pricing  risk,  asset  liability  management,  risk,  and\nexposure to major losses. In addition, identify impediments to equal opportunities\nbetween the private and public sector insurance companies. On the basis of the\nresults,  develop  restructuring  and  divestment  plans  for  NIC  and  actions,  as\nappropriate, to remove any market distortions between the public and private\nsectors.\n3. Development of Pension and Provident Funds\n(i) Obtain and review the financial and operational information on private pension\nfunds  and  the  Employees  Provident  Fund  (EPF).    Examine  the  legal  and\nregulatory  framework  currently  applicable  to  pension  and  provident  funds,\nincluding the Employees\u2019 Provident Fund Act of 1992, and identify weaknesses\nrelating  to  solvency,  fund  administration,  investment  management,  fiduciary\nrequirements, and member protection.\n(ii) Based on the results of item i) and considering the findings of component 1,\nrecommend an appropriate regulatory structure and policies for pension schemes\nand provident funds in Nepal that cater to various segments of the population\nand industry.\n(iii) Recommend  and  draft  appropriate  amendments  to  existing  law,  including\namendments to the EPF Act and new legislation to govern private pension funds,\nas well as supportive rules and regulations to implement the recommendations\nmade.\n(iv) Analyze the existing and potential role of pension and provident funds in the\nNepalese capital markets in reducing old-age poverty.\n(v) Explore the feasibility of establishing a national (pillar 1) pension scheme.", "74\nAppendix 10, page 11\n(vi) Recommend  approaches  and  modalities  for  encouraging  professional\nmanagement of pension and provident funds and gratuity schemes in the public\nand private sectors.\n(vii) Review the operations of the EPF; propose revision of the investment policy of\nEPF and prepare a plan for decentralized fund management activities.\n(viii) Conduct  workshops  with  public  and  private  sector  representatives  and\nprofessional  firms  to  discuss  the  proposed  options,  with  the  objective  of\ndeveloping a feasible reform proposal.\n(ix) Prepare training programs and conduct training to upgrade the knowledge of staff\nin charge of pension and provident funds.\n(x) Recommend incentive schemes to promote pension and provident funds.\nC.
