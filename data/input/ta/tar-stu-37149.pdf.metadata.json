With the assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic (Lao PDR), Myanmar, Thailand, Viet Nam, and Yunnan Province in the \nPeople's Republic of China (PRC)\u2014comprising the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS)\u2014initiated \na program of subregional economic cooperation in 1992. The GMS program has contributed to \nthe establishment of infrastructure and services to develop the subregion\u2019s shared resource \nbase and promote the freer flow of goods and people. As one of the stakeholder organizations \ninvolved in GMS planning, the Mekong River Commission (MRC) has actively contributed to \nformulation of GMS strategies and programs. This cooperation resulted in the identification of \nimproved flood management and mitigation in the lower Mekong River basin as one of 11 GMS \nflagship projects. \n \n2.  In 2003 MRC requested ADB to provide technical assistance (TA) to support its flood \nmanagement and mitigation program (FMMP).1 An ADB Fact-Finding Mission visited MRC\u2019s \nheadquarters in Phnom Penh during 9\u201313 June 2003 to discuss with MRC the objectives, \nscope, costs, and implementation and financing arrangements for the TA.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The Flood Problem. Flooding of the vast floodplains in the lower Mekong River basin is \nan annual event that adversely impacts economic and human activities, often claiming lives and \ncausing  extensive  damage  to  important  infrastructure,  human  settlements,  and  essential \nservices. Nonetheless, persons living in the affected areas do not consider floods that last for as \nlong as 6 months a year as disasters unless they are deeper than normal, unexpectedly fast in \nonset,  or  unusually  prolonged.  Regular  floods  are  seen  as  a  source  of  livelihood  and \nsustenance. Their beneficial impacts include rejuvenation of wetlands as breeding grounds for \naquatic plants, fish, and animals (vital sources of income and food for the poor); enrichment of \nsoil  by  river-borne  sediments  and  nutrients  beneficial  to  agriculture;  and  replenishment  of \nreservoirs and groundwater as reserves against dry season water shortages.  \n \n4.  The Mekong River basin has experienced several major floods during the last 50 years. \nThose of 1961 and 1966 were particularly disastrous in the central part of the river basin. In \n1996 and 2000, floods were exceptionally severe in the lower part of the basin. Although less \ndamaging than the flood of 2000, the 2001 flood was at even higher levels at certain locations \nalong the river. \n \n5.  Severe floods counteract efforts to improve economic development and reduce poverty \nin the lower Mekong River basin. In 2000 more than 800 people died and economic damage \nwas assessed at more than $400 million. In 2001 more than 300 lives were lost and damage \nwas $100 million. The international community assisted the affected communities by providing \nemergency  relief  and  rehabilitation  assistance.  Following  the  2000  floods,  ADB  provided \nemergency assistance for flood damage rehabilitation in Cambodia and Viet Nam.3 \n                                                 \n1  MRC\u2019s FMMP was approved by the MRC Council in October 2002. The FMMP comprises six interrelated \ncomponents: (i) establishment of a regional flood management and mitigation center, (ii) structural measures, (iii) \ntransboundary mediation, (iv) flood emergency management, (v) flood-proofing measures, and (vi) land use \nmanagement. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 18 October 2003. \n3  ADB  provided  a  total  of  $135.3  million  in  loan  funds,  comprising  $76.5  million  for  the  Emergency  Flood \nRehabilitation  Project  in  Cambodia  and  $58.8  million  for  the  Emergency  Assistance  for  Flood  Damage \nRehabilitation in Viet Nam. ", "2 \n \n6.  The Flood Management and Mitigation Program. Rapidly increasing populations in \nthe region have necessitated intensification of land use throughout the Mekong River basin, and \nthe riparian countries have made large investments in infrastructure and services to meet the \nneeds of the growing population. Although the improvements have helped the region achieve \nstrong economic growth, there has been a corresponding increase in the adverse impacts of \nfloods.  The  activities  of  humans  (including  interventions  such  as  roads,  bridges,  flood \nembankments, in-filling of drainage channels and lowlands, river diversions, land clearing and \nintensification of agriculture, and building within flood-prone areas) have increased the risk \nposed by floods. In addition, in the absence of a strong coordinating mechanism, the riparian \ncountries have tended to adopt development programs that have potentially negative impacts \non other parts of the river basin.  \n \n7.  Given the urgent need for coordination among the riparian countries and the increasing \nloss and suffering caused by floods, MRC was charged in 2001 to develop a strategy and \nprogram to deal with the threat of future flood disasters in the Mekong River basin. The overall \ngoal of the Flood Management and Mitigation Program or the FMMP is to prevent, minimize, or \nmitigate  people\u2019s  suffering  and  economic  losses  due  to  floods  while  preserving  the \nenvironmental benefits of floods. The FMMP is based on priorities agreed upon by the four \nmember countries of MRC, and its components are closely interrelated.4 It has been designed to \nbe implemented over 6 years at an estimated cost of $23.79 million.5  \n \n8.  MRC member countries have thus committed to manage the natural resources of the \nbasin in a sustainable manner and for their mutual benefit. They recognize the need to conserve \nthe beneficial economic and environmental impacts of floods and, by adopting the principles \ndefined in the FMMP, have agreed to an integrated approach to management and mitigation of \nMekong River floods. \n \n9.  A detailed basinwide implementation plan is now needed to realize the FMMP. The TA \nwill assist MRC to develop the implementation plan and to build its own capacity for continued \nrefinement of the plan. Development of the plan will use a regional approach giving attention to \ntransboundary issues and taking account of the outputs of all ongoing MRC programs and other \nactivities under the FMMP.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The purpose of the TA is to reduce the vulnerability of people living in the Mekong River \nbasin to the negative impacts of floods. Its main deliverable will be an implementation plan for \ncomponents 2 and 5 of MRC\u2019s FMMP for the Mekong River basin and its subbasins. The plan \nwill bring a more concrete form to the strategic approach and program described in the FMMP, \nand will be used subsequently under the GMS program to prepare investment projects with \ncross-boundary implications and synergies. A project framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n                                                 \n4  The FMMP was developed through national consultations and regional workshops during 2001 and 2002. \n5  The program will be funded by grant funds provided by bilateral sources, multilateral aid agencies, and member \ncountry contributions. ", "    3 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The  TA  will  support  implementation  of  all  activities  grouped  under  MRC\u2019s  FMMP \ncomponents 2 (structural measures) and 5 (flood-proofing measures). The TA will realize the \nfollowing outputs: (i) implementation plan for the FMMP (output 1); and (ii) capacity built within \nMRC and its four National Mekong Committees (NMCs) for development and refinement of the \nplan  (output  2).  Key  activities  for  output  1  are  to  (i)  describe  Mekong  River  basin  flood \ncharacteristics; (ii) evaluate flood-proofing measures and derive guidelines and best practices; \n(iii) determine the potential for structural interventions and develop guidelines and procedures \nfor  incorporating  best  practices  in  the  design  of  structural  measures;  (iv)  develop  an \nimplementation plan for components 2 and 5 of the FMMP, including optimum sequencing; and \n(v) determine discrete programs of subbasin interventions and assign priorities. Key activities for \noutput 2 are to (i) build the capacity of MRC for stakeholder participation and consensus \nbuilding,  and  (ii)  prepare  and  implement  training  programs  on  various  aspects  of  the \nimplementation  plan.  A  summary  initial  poverty  and  social  analysis  is  in  Appendix  2. \nSupplementary Appendix A provides an indicative schedule of activities for components 2 and \n5. \n \n12.  In developing the plan, the TA consultants will evaluate transboundary issues and will \nensure that all relevant outputs from ongoing MRC programs and related activities under the \nFMMP are fully integrated into a comprehensive and phased implementation plan.6 The plan will \nprovide  a  regional  framework  for  high  priority  flood  management  interventions  to  reduce \nvulnerability to floods, especially among the poor and other vulnerable groups. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $3.7 million equivalent, comprising $2.14 million \nin foreign exchange and $1.56 million in local currency (Appendix 3). ADB will finance $1.0 \nmillion equivalent on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA program. The Government of the \nNetherlands (through its Royal Netherlands Embassy [RNE] in Hanoi) will provide a grant of \n$2.7 million equivalent as parallel cofinancing. The TA will support the provision of consulting \nservices, training, and national and regional consultation workshops.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB  will  enter  into  a  TA  agreement  with  MRC  to  implement  the  TA.7  MRC  is  an \ninternational  agency  charged  with  promoting  cooperation  in  all  fields  of  sustainable \ndevelopment, utilization,  management,  and  conservation of the water and related resources of  \n                                                 \n6  Components 1, 3, 4, and 6 of the FMMP are being supported by other agencies and will be undertaken \nsimultaneously with components 2 and 5. The work will require a high level of coordination by MRC, and it will be \nincumbent on the TA consultants to liaise closely with MRC and consultants engaged in parallel and related \nactivities (para. 0). \n7  The TA is a relatively small component of the FMMP, and its management by MRC will help ensure better \nintegration and coordination among the different components. ", "4 \nthe Mekong River basin.8 MRC conducts a wide range of technical services using its own staff \naugmented by consultants and specialists, and is the most qualified and competent agency to \nprovide the services required. It has implemented many externally financed programs of a \nsimilar  nature,  and  can  mobilize  well-qualified  personnel  quickly.  Accordingly,  MRC  is \nconsidered competent to manage the TA.  \n \n15.  The four NMCs, represented by their secretariats, will help coordinate the TA and other \nFMMP activities at the country level.9 The NMC secretariats will also interface with collaborating \ngovernment agencies. Consultants, local institutions, and civil society organizations (CSOs) will \nbe engaged under the TA to assist MRC and the NMC secretariats. Consultation with national \nand international agencies and with representatives of specific target groups will be achieved \nthrough a series of national and regional workshops.10 \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 22 months, beginning in early 2004. It will require \napproximately 284 person-months (110 international, and 174 domestic) of additional technical \nexpertise. Expertise will be required in the fields of project management, social surveys and \nrelated analyses, community participation, environmental studies, flood management, hydrology \nand river hydraulics, mapping and geographic information systems, economic and financial \nanalyses, and training. An indicative staffing schedule is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n17.  ADB  will  finance  32  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  90  of \ndomestic. The specialists will be recruited as individuals and will comprise (i) an international \nchief technical advisor (CTA) with responsibility for technical overview of the TA and its overall \nsupervision,11 (ii) international and domestic training and public participation specialists, and (iii) \nnational  program  specialists  representing  flood  management  agencies  of  the  four  member \ncountries of MRC. Their role will be twofold: capacity building within MRC and the NMCs for \nstakeholder participation, consensus building, and refinement of the implementation plan (output \n2); and technical oversight and day-to-day coordination of TA activities to ensure splicing of the \nvarious components of the FMMP into the implementation plan. The ADB-financed specialists \nwill  work  closely  with  those  financed  by  the  Netherlands\u2019  grant  and  will  be integrated,  as \nnecessary, into the team responsible for output 1 under the direction of the team leader. All \nspecialists will be selected by MRC following ADB's procedures or through other arrangements \nacceptable to ADB for selecting and engaging domestic experts.12 The terms of reference for \nthe technical expertise are in Appendix 4. \n \n                                                 \n8  MRC started in 1957 as the Mekong Committee under the umbrella of the United Nation\u2019s Economic Commission \nfor Asia and the Far East. It became an independent international organization in 1995 with the signing of an \nagreement on cooperation by Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam for the sustainable development of the \nMekong  River  basin.  The  agreement  has  the  status  of  an  international  treaty  and  gives  full  management \nresponsibility of MRC to a Council of Ministers of member countries. Its Articles provide the basis for the member \nstates to negotiate specific agreements on a comprehensive basin development planning process, rules of water \nutilization,  and  a  range  of  political,  social,  economic,  and  technical  matters  needed  to  ensure  sustainable \ndevelopment within the basin. MRC provides a continuous point of reference and source of knowledge relating to \nthe natural resources of the lower Mekong River Basin. \n9  The NMCs of Cambodia and Lao PDR are under the jurisdiction of the office of their respective prime ministers. \nThe NMC of Thailand is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, and the NMC \nof Viet Nam is under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.  \n10 The Annual Flood Forum\u2014one of the FMMP activities\u2014will provide a regular forum for broad-based, regional \nconsultation.  \n11 The CTA will ensure close coordination with all ongoing MRC programs and FMMP activities.  \n12 The personnel will be selected from among qualified nationals of ADB's member countries. ", "    5 \n18.  MRC will establish a special account for expenditures to be financed under the TA, to be \nused for the ADB and the Netherlands grants. MRC will maintain separate records (expressed \nin dollars) of the ADB and Netherlands funds. An advance payment facility will be used: the \ninitial advance from each organization will cover anticipated expenditures for the first 6 months \nof TA implementation. Subsequent payments to the account will be based on projected needs \nover the next 6 months and will be subject to liquidation of the initial advance. \n \n19.  MRC will prepare separate accounts for ADB and Netherlands grants, and arrange an \nannual audit of ADB\u2019s financing by an auditing firm acceptable to ADB. The annual audit report \nwill be submitted to ADB within 9 months of the close of each fiscal year. In reporting progress \n(see para. 20), MRC will provide details of expenses incurred during the reporting period, \ncumulative  expenditures,  and  expenditures  projected  during  the  next  6  months  for  each \naccount. \n \n20.  MRC will submit 6-monthly progress reports to ADB and RNE covering all activities \nfinanced under the TA. The reports will describe achievements in relation to the activities \nschedule and FMMP\u2019s time-bound targets and indicators, identified problems and steps being \ntaken to resolve such problems, and plans for the next reporting period. MRC will prepare and \nsubmit a TA midterm report, and a completion report to ADB and RNE within 6 months of TA \ncompletion. In addition, MRC will submit technical reports prepared under the TA and under \nother FMMP components to ADB and RNE for information and comments. MRC will make all \nTA outputs available to the public through its library services and on its web site.13 \n \n21.  MRC will facilitate joint aid agency reviews of the TA and other components of the \nFMMP. The reviews will be scheduled at least 2 months before the annual Council Meeting so \nthat their findings can be shared with the Council. The joint reviews will be undertaken at least \nannually. ADB may also undertake separate reviews of the TA. MRC will invite\u2014with sufficient \nadvance notice\u2014representatives of ADB and RNE to country and regional workshops organized \nunder the TA and other components of the FMMP. \n \n22.  MRC will adopt a program performance management system (PPMS) for monitoring and \nevaluating  overall  progress,  outputs,  and  outcomes  of  the  TA  at  various  stages  of \nimplementation. The PPMS will comprise (i) FMMP\u2019s program framework with its quantified and \ntime-bound  targets  and  indicators,  and  associated  key  risks  and  assumptions;  (ii)  regular \nprogram progress reports to track progress from the baseline situation against the targets \n(based  on  the  indicators  identified  in  the  program  framework);  (iii)  baseline  and  follow-up \nsurveys; and (iv) component completion reports and an overall FMMP completion report. The \nbaseline  and  follow-up  surveys  will  be  conducted  among  agencies,  local  authorities,  and \ncommunities,  including  the  specific  target  groups  that  are  key  beneficiaries  of  the  FMMP. \nSpecial attention will be given to discerning pro-poor effects of the FMMP. The PPMS will be \nfinanced by the Netherlands Government through separate grant financing. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis \nfor Support for the Mekong River Commission Flood Management and Mitigation Program, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n13 Final versions of the reports, approved by ADB and RNE, may be disseminated.

At the household level they cause loss of life due \nto drowning and illness; destruction of crops, houses, and other possessions; loss of livestock; and worsening poverty \nand indebtedness in rural areas. Floods can be particularly devastating for poor farmers/fishers for whom recovery \n(replanting of crops, purchase of inputs and livestock, repair of houses and fishing gear) entails borrowing. As part of \na broad program of improved natural resources management, the GMS Subregional Cooperation Strategy and \nProgram (SCSP) aims to reduce risks posed by natural disasters. Improved flood management, based on a \ncombination of flood proofing and structural flood protection measures, can contribute substantially to poverty \nreduction. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  Proposed Classification \n \nProposed Classification: Poverty Intervention  Thematic: Environment Protection \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?   \nPoverty in the lower Mekong River basin is related to lack of access to resources, limited opportunity for alternative \nlivelihoods, and heightened uncertainty due to wide-ranging variability in floods and related natural phenomena. The \npoverty analysis will aim to delineate priority areas for assistance and determine the most appropriate form of \nassistance for sustainable socioeconomic improvement. The vulnerability of poor rural communities to floods and \nother natural disasters in lowland areas will be assessed to design means of strengthening traditional coping \nmechanisms and self-reliance through such means as flood proofing of houses, creation of community-financed and \nmanaged funds for disaster relief and recovery, flood damage insurance, and alternative livelihood initiatives. \n \nC.

The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  participated  closely  with  the  Mekong  River \nCommission (MRC) in reviewing and finalizing its flood management and mitigation program \n(FMMP), which sets out a strategy for preparing an integrated flood management plan linking \nsix interrelated components. These terms of reference (TOR) describe the major outputs, key \nactivities, and general work plan for consultants implementing the technical assistance (TA) to \nsupport components 2 and 5 of MRC\u2019s FMMP.  \n \n2.  MRC will implement the TA, and will select and engage consultants following ADB's \nprocedures  or  through  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for  selecting  and  engaging \ndomestic  consultants  and  civil  society  organizations  (CSOs).  The  consultants\u2019  team  will \ncomprise specialists recruited through a firm as well as individually. All will work together under \nthe direction of the firm\u2019s team leader.  \n \n3.  Within MRC, the Operations Division will have primary responsibility for TA activities. \nThe  office  of  the  chief  executive  officer  (CEO)  and  the  regional  flood  management  and \nmitigation center (RFMMC)\u2014equivalent to a division\u2014will also be involved in implementation, \nas shown in the Table. Coordination of TA activities with other FMMP components and MRC \nprograms will be undertaken through MRC\u2019s current coordination framework. \n \nTable A4: Arrangements for Coordination with Other Programs \n \nComponent  Responsible Division  Collaborating Divisions/ \nPrograms \nStructural and flood-proofing  Operations Division   AIFP,  BDP,  EP,  FFEWS, \nmeasures (components 2 and 5)  Fisheries Program, WUP \nEstablishment of RFMMC  Initially  the  Technical  Support  TSD and OPD \n(component 1)  Division (TSD) and later RFMMC \n(once established) \nTransboundary mediation  Office of the CEO  RFMMC (once established) \n(component 3) \nEmergency management  Initially  OPD  and  later  RFMMC  TSD and OPD \nstrengthening (component 4)  (once established)  \nLand use management  OPD  AIFP, BDP, EP \n(component 6) \nAIFP  =  agriculture, irrigation and forestry program;  BDP =  basin development plan;  CEO =  chief executive officer;  \nEP = environmental program; FFEWS = flood forecasting and early warning system; RFMMC = regional flood \nmanagement and mitigation center; WUP = water utilization program. \nSource: MRC. \n \n4.  MRC will select a chief technical advisor (CTA) to supervise TA implementation. A \nFMMP coordinator, assisted by the CTA, will be placed in the Office of the CEO to ensure day-\nto-day coordination of TA activities. The FMMP coordinator will head the interdivisional FMMP \nworking group. The secretariats of the four National Mekong Committees (NMCs) will provide \nliaison between the TA and related activities at country level, and will interface with collaborating \ngovernment agencies, local authorities, and CSOs at the country level. In each country, a \n ", "14  Appendix 4 \nnational  FMMP  coordination  group  will  be  established  comprising  the  head  of  NMC  and \nrepresentatives of the collaborating agencies. In the case of Viet Nam, special arrangements \nwill be made to interact with the Cuu Long River Basin Organization.1  \n \n5.  On a day-to-day basis the TA consultants will work closely with relevant MRC staff. As \nmuch as possible, the consultants will be integrated into the existing working arrangements of \nMRC to permit the splicing of the particular activities under the TA into ongoing MRC programs.  \n \nB.  Terms of Reference \n6.  The objective of consulting services is to assist MRC to develop an implementation plan \nfor components 2 and 5 of MRC\u2019s FMMP for the Mekong River basin and its subbasins (output \n1). The TA consultants will also build management capacity within MRC for developing and \nrefining  the  implementation  plan,  including  the  capacity  for  stakeholder  participation  and \nconsensus building, and for developing and implementing structured on-the-job and formal in-\ncountry training (output 2). They will formulate programs for special subject matter training at \nregional education centers.  \n \n7.  The  basic  reference  documents  for  the  TA  are  (i)  MRC  Flood  Management  and \nMitigation Strategy (November 2001), (ii) Flood Management Programme document (November \n2002), (iii) Detailed Workplan for Implementation of the MRC Flood Management and Mitigation \nProgramme (April 2003), and (iv) minutes of an informal aid agencies meeting on 24 April 2003. \n \n1.  Implementation Plan for the Flood Management and Mitigation Program \n(Output 1) \n8.  Output 1 will entail five main activities. \n \na.  Describe Characteristics of Mekong River Basin Floods \n9.  The consultants\u2019 tasks are as follows: \n \n  (i)  Assist MRC draft a strategy for flood management as an input to the basin \ndevelopment plan (BDP), based on a review of data, maps, and reports held by \nMRC, and a study of the extent and nature of existing flood control measures, \ncurrent  status  of  national  plans  for  implementing  flood  control  works, \nrecommended  criteria  for  project  identification,  and  linkages  between  flood \nmanagement strategies and the different elements of BDP,2 \n  (ii)  Compile, review, and inventory available data on the nature, extent, timing, and \nduration of Mekong River floods, including any perceived changes in the cycle, \n  (iii)  Revise and update existing maps and create a geographic information system \n(GIS) for the Mekong River basin, cross-referenced to MRC\u2019s existing databases, \n  (iv)  Undertake frequency and deterministic statistical analyses of historic floods and \ntheir  impacts,  in  close  cooperation  with  MRC  staff  and  other  consultants \ndeveloping risk assessment tools under FMMP component 1 (establishment of \nthe RFMMC). \n \n                                                 \n1  The Cuu Long River Basin Organization is being strengthened under a program supported by Australian Agency \nfor International Development (AusAID).  \n2  The output of this task, to be undertaken by the individually recruited flood management specialist, will be a \nconcise report consistent with the overall reporting needs of BDP. ", "  Appendix 4  15 \nb.  Evaluate Flood-Proofing Measures \n10.  The consultants\u2019 tasks are as follows: \n \n  (i)  Compile data on the beneficial (environmental, social, and economic) impacts of \nfloods in the Mekong River basin. \n  (ii)  Evaluate  the  benefits  of  flood  proofing  and  other  \u201csoft\u201d  measures  (flood \nforecasting and early warning, evacuation roads, and financial instruments),3 \n  (iii)  Conduct  socioeconomic  surveys  and  poverty  analyses  of  flood-affected \ncommunities to determine the positive and negative impacts of floods on their \nlives,4 \n  (iv)  Evaluate the traditional coping mechanisms of communities faced with recurrent \nflood events, \n  (v)  Undertake flood damage vulnerability analyses (desegregating the impacts on \nwomen, children, and other vulnerable groups),  \n  (vi)  Develop guidelines for incorporating best practices in the design of flood-proofing \nmeasures (including recommendations covering traditional coping mechanisms). \n \nc.  Determine the Potential for Structural Interventions \n11.  The consultants\u2019 tasks are as follows: \n \n  (i)  Inventory  existing  and  planned  structures  that  have  or  could  have  hydraulic \nimpacts on Mekong River flows, \n  (ii)  Determine the nature and extent of the impacts of structural interventions on \nMekong River flows, \n  (iii)  Review and assess the operating rules for major hydraulic structures (dams, \nreservoirs, major flood control works, river diversions, and flood retention basins), \nincluding operation and maintenance (O&M) capabilities, \n  (iv)  Review and compare national design standards for dams, reservoirs, major flood \ncontrol works, etc., \n  (v)  Using the newly developed risk assessment tools from FMMP component 1, \nanalyze  failure  risk  of  structural  interventions;  and  examine  the  impacts  of \nproposed new structures,5 \n  (vi)  Develop guidelines and procedures for incorporating best practices in the design \nof structural measures. \n \n                                                 \n3  In these TOR, \u201csoft\u201d measures are those which do not increase water levels within the river channel and do not, \ntherefore, increase the risk of overbank flow or failure of flood control works. \u201cHard\u201d measures are those which \ncause increases in water levels in the river channel (either adjacent to the works or at other locations within the \nriver system as a direct result of the works). Hard measures include flood control embankments and other works \ndesigned to prevent floodwater from leaving the river and spreading over the floodplain. The classification based \non impact is seen to be more useful than the more arbitrary classification of measures as \u201cstructural\u201d or \n\u201cnonstructural.\u201d  \n4  Determine the different impacts of floods, both beneficial and negative, on different ethnic groups, their means of \ncoping with such events, and the need to develop different approaches in designing flood management and \nmitigating measures. An indigenous people\u2019s plan will be prepared if ADB considers such differences to be \nsignificant. \n5  Risks to be considered will include residual and newly created risks of flood inundation, risks associated with \ndesign and construction errors, risks of overtopping or structural failure, risks associated with extreme events (i.e., \nlarger-than-design standard), and other pertinent risks. The consultants should draw on whatever results are \navailable from FMMP component 4 (emergency management strengthening). \n ", "16  Appendix 4 \nd.  Develop an Implementation Plan for Components 2 and 5 of the Flood \nManagement and Mitigation Program \n12.  The consultants\u2019 tasks are as follows: \n \n  (i)  Review  and  compare  national  flood  management  strategies  to  discern \ninconsistencies,  and  formulate  recommendations  aimed  at  eliminating  such \ninconsistencies, \n  (ii)  Determine  interactively  the  flood  management  constraints  and  opportunities \nencapsulated in BDP, environment program, and water utilization program, \n  (iii)  Formulate subbasin flood management development programs to reduce the risk \nof loss and damage due to floods, \n  (iv)  Establish appropriate design standards for integrated structural and nonstructural \nflood management measures, including flood proofing and other soft measures \n(based on the outcomes of related activities), \n  (v)  Determine  transboundary  and  cumulative  impacts  of  various  measures,  in \nisolation and in combination, \n  (vi)  Prepare an overall implementation plan for realizing components 2 and 5 of the \nFMMP for Mekong River basin and its subbasins to maximize socioeconomic and \nenvironmental benefits (integrating to the extent possible the outputs of other \nFMMP components),6 \n  (vii)  Determine  optimum  sequencing  of  interventions  based  on  technical, \nenvironmental,  and  socioeconomic  aspects;  and  formulate  an  overall \nimplementation schedule.  \n \ne.  Desegregate the Implementation Plan into Subbasin Components \n13.  The consultants\u2019 tasks are as follows: \n \n  (i)  Determine discrete programs of interventions on the basis of subbbasins and \nassign priorities, \n  (ii)  propose  arrangements  for  sharing  costs  among  member  countries,  where \nappropriate. \n \n2.  Building  Management  Capacity  for  Developing  and  Refining  the \nImplementation Plan (Output 2) \n14.  Output 2 will entail two key activities. \n \na.  Enhance Capacity for Consultation and Consensus Building \n15.  The consultants\u2019 tasks are as follows: \n \n  (i)  Develop mechanisms for coordinating the TA activities with those of the core \nprograms, working groups, and other programs and activities as appropriate, \n  (ii)  Institute a process for stakeholder participation in developing and refining the \nFMMP implementation plan, \n                                                 \n6  In preparing the plan, the consultant will identify, to the extent possible, land acquisition and resettlement impacts \nand will be responsive to the need to minimize involuntary resettlement. In addition, areas of particular flood hazard \nwill be identified with a view to restricting development within them. ", "  Appendix 4  17 \n  (iii)  Organize and conduct national and regional consultation workshops, \n  (iv)  Prepare and implement public awareness campaigns. \n \nb.  Develop Training Programs \n16.  The consultants\u2019 tasks are as follows: \n \n  (i)  Prepare and implement structured on-the-job training programs, \n  (ii)  Formulate and implement staff training in technical, environmental, and social \naspects of developing and refining the FMMP implementation plan, \n  (iii)  Formulate programs for special training at regional education centers, \n  (iv)  Prepare and implement formal in-country training programs. \n \nC.  Surveys and Investigations \n17.  Surveys will be conducted to discern the impacts of floods on different ethnic minority \ngroups. From the results, the consultants will develop appropriate indigenous peoples planning \ndocuments, as necessary. Other surveys and investigations may also be required during the \nTA; their exact nature will be determined in consultation with MRC. For all such surveys and for \nany special studies and pilot initiatives to be undertaken by other firms, institutions, or CSOs, \nthe consultants will assist MRC to develop scope and TOR and to supervise implementation.  \n \nD.  Stakeholder Workshops and Meetings \n18.  The consultants will assist MRC to conduct stakeholder workshops and meetings at key \ndecision  points  in  the  work  program.  All  such  workshops  and  meetings  will  follow  MRC\u2019s \nstandard practice for stakeholder consultation and consensus building. Hence, adequate time \nwill be built into the work program for consultation, planning, and conducting all necessary \nworkshops  and  meetings.  Consultation  with  beneficiaries  and  with  people  who  may  be \nadversely affected by any works related to the FMMP will be fully incorporated as standard \noperating procedure during the TA. The TA will ensure that the four member countries approve \nthe implementation plan for components 2 and 5 of MRC\u2019s FMMP by end-2005. \n \nE.  Reporting \n19.  The consultants will prepare an inception report (to be submitted within 3 months of the \nstart of the main contract for consulting services); semiannual progress reports; midterm report \n(to be submitted within 9 months of the start of the main contract for consulting services); and a \ndraft final report (to be submitted 2 months before completion of the main contract for consulting \nservices). The final report will be prepared on the basis of comments on the draft final report \nreceived from the NMCs, MRC, Government of the Netherlands, and ADB. The consultants will \nprepare a series of technical reports, workshop reports, training manuals, and training modules, \nthe exact nature and timing of which are to be indicated in the inception report. \n \n20.  The consultants will also collaborate with MRC and the NMCs to prepare publications for \nregional and international professional journals of regional significance. The number of such \npublications will be decided at the time of contract negotiation. \n \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20040422154533+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20031222065909Z", "Title": "Microsoft Word - Draft TA Report _09.12.03_.doc", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "cbr", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 5.0.5 (Windows)"}}
