THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Jiangxi  Ganzhou  Rural  Vitalization  and \nComprehensive Environment Improvement Project. \n \n2.  The proposed project will advance rural vitalization and ecological protection in Ganzhou \nMunicipality (Ganzhou) in Jiangxi Province (Jiangxi)  by (i) enhancing the regional and local \necological and environmental management capacities; (ii) promoting rural transformation and the \nregion\u2019s transition to green development; (iii) developing the rural environmental infrastructure to \naddress degradation from economic development; and (iv) improving ecosystem protection of the \narea to improve livability. The project\u2019s experiences and best practices of relieving climate change \nand ecological pressures can be replicated in the rest of the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB), \nother parts of the PRC, and developing member countries of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \nThe project area includes Ganzhou\u2019s Nankang District and eight counties: Chongyi, Dayu, \nHuichang,  Ningdu,  Shangyou,  Shicheng,  Xingguo,  and  Yudu,  benefiting  578,138  residents \n(285,651 women). \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The YREB is one of the three key economic growth engines in the PRC. Its nine provinces \nand two directly administered municipalities account for more than 40% of the population, 40% of \nfreshwater resources, and about 45% of the country\u2019s economic output. While the YREB has \nbenefited from extensive development since the 1980s, economic growth in the middle and upper \nreaches of the Yangtze River basin lags that of the coastal areas. The basin faces significant \nchallenges because of (i) weak institutional coordination for strategic planning; (ii) increasing \npollution and pressure on natural resources; (iii) slow transition to green development; and \n(iv) limited integration of waterways, ports, and intermodal logistics. To manage these challenges, \nthe Government of the PRC formulated the YREB Development Plan, 2016\u20132030.1 ADB and the \ngovernment  also  agreed  to  adopt  a  systematic  approach  that  prioritizes  (i)  institutional \nstrengthening  and  policy  reforms;  (ii)  ecosystem  restoration,  environmental  protection,  and \nmanagement of water resources; (iii) inclusive green development; and (iv) construction of an \nintegrated multimodal transport corridor. The project is included in the YREB framework.2 \n \n4.  Rural transformation has lagged urban development in the YREB. As a result, income \ninequality persists in rural areas of the less-developed middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze \nRiver basin. Rural wastewater and solid waste in most rural areas are directly discharged into the \nwater bodies without treatment or safe disposal. In 2020, only 29% of villages had appropriate \nsanitation facilities and 75% had solid waste collection and disposal services, both contributing to \npoor environmental conditions.3 As the rural economy expands, proper regulatory, administrative, \nand environmental management will require stronger institutional capacity. To help respond, ADB \nsupports the PRC\u2019s rural vitalization strategy of promoting rural development, green and inclusive \ngrowth, wastewater and waste management, and ecosystem protection.4 \n \n \n1   Government of the PRC. 2016.

The watershed area that lies within Ganzhou covers 36,400 square \nkilometers, or 44.8% of the total watershed area.  Gan River, 766 kilometers, is running through \nthe province from south to north. Gan River is the largest tributary of Poyang Lake, through which \nit connects to Yangtze River. Poyang Lake is heavily affected by high levels of nutrient pollution \nloads from Gan River, which also accelerate the environmental and ecological degradation of the \nrural areas along the river. \n \n6.  Ganzhou is a large agricultural prefecture-level municipality in the south of Jiangxi. It lies \nin the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and on the upper Gan River, and is part of the YREB. \nIt had an estimated population of 9.8 million in 2020 and a land area of 39,380 square kilometers.5 \nGanzhou was selected for the project because it has high rural\u2013urban inequalities with urban \naverage  disposable  income  nearly  three  times  rural  and  weak  institutional  capacity  for \nenvironmental management. It lags other municipalities in Jiangxi in economic development.6 \nGanzhou also suffers from repeated heavy rains and floods. It has a pressing need to improve \nthe livability, health, and livelihood outcomes of its local communities. The State Council of the \nPRC chose Ganzhou as a demonstration area because it is relatively rural, has substantial \nagricultural and forestry potential, has a growing tourism industry, and lies in Jiangxi, a national \necological pilot zone with unique tourism resources and environmental advantages. \n \n7.  Weak institutional capacity for ecological and environmental management. The \nregulatory,  institutional,  and  technical  capacities  for  environmental  management  and  flood \nprotection are inadequate at all administrative levels of Ganzhou. The systems for environmental \nmonitoring,  environmental  information  management,  river  water  quality  monitoring,  and  air \npollution control are all weak or outdated and require urgent upgrades.7 Gan River has only a few \nautomated water quality monitoring stations, and the testing equipment is insufficient. Ganzhou \nalso  lacks  effective  environmental  management  information  system,  has  environmental \nenforcement system, and has weak financial management systems. Regulatory enforcement is \nweak, as is effective information sharing between districts and counties, or the advocacy of and \npublic participation in environmental problem-solving. \n \n8.  Absence of viable green development and financing mechanisms. As a lagging \nmunicipality, Ganzhou lacks sustainable green development and green financing mechanisms to \ninvest in water pollution control and rural livelihood improvements. Green agriculture technologies \nand practices to reduce nonpoint source pollution for green development are not widely applied.8 \nUnsustainable farming practices and poor farm waste management persist. Ganzhou offers no \nincentives for private sector investments to accelerate green development through village-based \neco-friendly  business  development  (e.g.,  ecotourism)  and  integrated  urban\u2013rural  economic \ndevelopment. SMEs and agriculture cooperatives have limited access to commercial funding \nsources, and sustainable green financing mechanisms are not fully established. \n \n9.  Inadequate  environmental  infrastructure  in  towns  and  villages.  The  ecological \nenvironment of Gan River faces many challenges. Point and nonpoint source pollution from urban \nand rural sewage and agricultural activities degrade the water quality, which is currently rated \n \n5  More than 70% of the land area is forested, and 80% is mountainous. Its altitude is 300\u2013500 meters above sea level. \n6  In 2019, Ganzhou was ranked 9th of 11 municipalities (gross domestic product per capita: CNY39,900). \n7  Ganzhou had an average concentration of particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometer in diameter of 39 milligram \nper cubic meter (mg/m3) in 2018; that of particulate matter less than 10 micrometer in diameter was 63 mg/m3. \n8  In 2015, the average consumption of agricultural chemicals was 641.30 kilograms of chemical fertilizers and \n41.10 kilograms of pesticides per hectare of farmland in Ganzhou, both well above national and provincial averages. \n \n ", "3 \nClass III.9 In 2019, 53,731 tons of chemical oxygen demand and 4,761 tons of ammonia nitrogen \nwere discharged into water bodies from point pollution sources in Ganzhou. While progress was \nmade in urban wastewater treatment, rural sanitation coverage is still limited, and 70% of rural \nsewage remains untreated. Public toilets in townships and rural areas are inadequate, and it is \ncommon practice to dump solid waste into rivers and water bodies. The sewage treatment \nfacilities and solid waste management systems that do exist are unable to meet the water quality \nand environmental requirements of the growing tourism industry. They are also poorly maintained \nbecause of a lack of government funding and limited community engagement. Rural access to \nwater supply does not meet national standards either.  \n \n10.  Water-related  disaster  risks  and  degraded ecosystems.  Flood  infrastructure  and \nmanagement systems are inadequate along Gan River, and flood control standards in rural areas \nneed upgrading. In 2019, a major flood event in Ganzhou inundated 128,600 hectares of \nfarmland, destroyed 472 houses, and caused damages totaling CNY3.38 billion. Continuous and \nintensive precipitation during the rainy season routinely triggers severe flooding in low-lying urban \nand rural areas. Flood control is hampered by insufficient river embankments and inadequate \nnonstructural protection measures. Weak forest management undermines the forests\u2019 capacity to \nattenuate soil erosion and water runoff, and thus impairs the resilience of the riverine ecosystem. \nGanzhou\u2019s soil erosion area was 7,142.3 square kilometers in 2018 (18.14% of total area), which \nis above the national average. Some wetland areas do not function effectively and have no \nproductive use.10 \n \n11.  COVID-19 pandemic. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has amplified the \nlinks between biodiversity, ecosystem degradation, public health, and livelihoods. COVID-19 has \nhad a widespread impact, resulting in social and economic disruption and threatening the PRC\u2019s \ncommunities. The pandemic remains a risk, particularly for the rural areas. With recognition of the \nneed to prevent the disease, rural vitalization is key to recovery from COVID-19. \n \n12.  Strategic fit. To improve the livelihood and living conditions in Ganzhou, the project will \n(i) tackle urban and rural ecological and environmental degradation issues, (ii) improve water \nquality in the Gan River basin, (iii) promote green financing mechanisms, and (iv) strengthen \nenvironmental management and pollution monitoring capacities. The project will support the \nPRC\u2019s  (i)  YREB  Development  Plan,  2016\u20132030,  which  emphasizes  green  development, \nenvironmental protection, rehabilitation, and management of water resources; (ii) Yangtze River \nProtection Law;11 and (iii) National Strategic Plan for Rural Vitalization, 2018\u20132022. The project \naligns with ADB policies, including (i) Strategy 2030 and its operational priorities;12 and (ii) the \ncountry partnership strategy, 2021\u20132025 for the PRC,13 which emphasizes the need to (a) reduce \ninequality  by  promoting  rural  vitalization,  (b)  restore  ecosystems  to  enable  more  inclusive \ndevelopment, (c) build climate and disaster resilience, and (d) encourage upper middle-income \ncountries to share knowledge. \n \n13.  Lessons. The project design incorporates lessons, best practices, and innovative  \n \n9  Based on the 2019 Ganzhou Municipal Environmental Quality Annual Report, 6.8% of the water quality at county \nboundaries was not in compliance with the Class III standard. The major pollutants are chemical oxygen demand, \nammonia nitrate, and mercury. \n10 Wetland productive uses include nutrient retention for better water quality, biodiversity enhancement, flood risk \nreduction, and irrigation reservoirs. \n11 Government of the PRC. 2020.

The government has requested a regular loan of \u20ac170.56 million ($200 million equivalent) \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the project. 21 The loan will have a 25-year \nterm, including a grace period of 6 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of \n0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project \nagreements. Based on the straight-line repayment method, the average maturity is 15.75 years, \nand the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.30% per year. The loan comprises a project loan \ncomponent and a financial intermediation loan (FIL) component (green financing mechanism \nunder output 2). The government, through the Jiangxi Provincial Government, will make the \nproceeds of the loan available to the GMG and GMG will make a portion of the proceeds of the \nloan to the implementing agencies on the same terms and conditions as apply to the loan. The \nGMG and project implementing agencies will bear the foreign exchange and interest rate variation \nrisks relating to the respective portion of the loan proceeds. ABC, as the financial intermediary, \nhas committed to (i) maintain the required prudential norms on (a) minimum capital ratios, (b) \nliquidity, and (c) total loss-absorbing capacity; and (ii) comply with the relevant requirements.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n25.  The  project  will  apply  innovative  and  sustainable  technologies,  strengthen  climate \nresilience, and demonstrate the importance of adaptation measures in Ganzhou. These were \nproposed by licensed domestic design institutes based on recommendation from the technical \nassistance  consultants  and  in  accordance  with  the  PRC\u2019s  guidelines  and  regulations;  the \nrecommendations also informed the project preparation.23 The technical feasibility was confirmed \nto be adequate after a detailed examination of the project\u2019s compatibility with local conditions and \nlocal  capacity  for  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M).  The  project  design  meets  the  PRC \nstandards and incorporates suitable technologies and materials for the assets and facilities \n \n23 ADB. 2019. Preparing Environmental and Rural Development Projects: Technical Assistance Report. Manila.  \n \n ", "8 \ncreated under the outputs and subcomponents. Alternative technical options identified suitable \nsites. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n26.  The economic analysis indicates that the project is economically viable, with an overall \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 11.7% and a net present value of CNY936.60 million. \nNet present values and EIRRs were calculated for outputs 2, 3, and 4. The analysis also confirms \nthe economic viability of these subprojects\u2014their EIRRs range from 8.6% to 21.6% and all exceed \nthe 9.0% hurdle rate.24 The economic benefits quantified include (i) increase in net farm income \nfrom investments in green agriculture; (ii) revenues from increased tourist traffic; (iii) benefits from \nimproved rural sanitation and water supply services, including avoided health care costs, and net \nwillingness to pay of the direct beneficiaries; (iv) value of ecological goods and services provided \nby afforestation, and forest and wetland improvements; and (v) downstream residents' willingness \nto pay for investments in better water quality. \n \n27.  The financial sustainability of the project\u2019s components was assessed based on the fiscal \nimpact of counterpart funds, O&M costs, and loan repayment obligation. At present, no tariff \napplies to wastewater and solid waste disposal in the project areas, so the related project \ncomponents are not generating revenue. In fact, only the FIL component of output 2 is generating \nrevenue. The financial analysis confirms the project\u2019s financial sustainability, since the project's \nfiscal impact on the GMG will be very limited.25 All components are deemed financially sustainable \ngiven that the executing and implementing agencies will have sufficient financial capacity to cover \nthe debt repayment and the recurring O&M costs of the components that do not generate revenue. \nABC has well-diversified operations across the PRC\u2019s urban and rural areas with a strong \nfranchise in county-level banking, agriculture-related industries, and rural communities. ABC is \nexpected to onlend an equivalent of $100 million (including $50 million in counterpart funding) to \neligible SMEs and agriculture cooperatives. Given ABC\u2019s well-established operations, and assets \ntotaling CNY27,205.0 billion as of 31 December 2020, it has the capacity to service its obligations \nunder the FIL component. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n28.  Assessments were carried out in the areas of (i) integrated planning, procurement, and \nfinancial management; (ii) institutional coordination and capacity development; (iii) water quality \nmanagement, air quality management, integrated flood risk management, climate adaptation and \nmitigation mainstreaming, and environmental planning and monitoring; (iv) design, construction, \nand  operation  of  wastewater  drainage  systems  and  solid  waste  treatment  facilities;  and \n(v) afforestation design and maintenance. The project will improve the water quality in the Gan \nRiver watershed, promote green agricultural practices, enhance soil and water conservation \ncapacity, and strengthen forest management in Ganzhou. The PMO will coordinate all key tasks \nwith the support of the project implementation consultant (PIC). Capacity building activities were \ndesigned to ensure that the PMO and operators use best practices and suitable technologies. As \nregards the financial sustainability of the FIL component, ABC is an established market leader \nand has a vast distribution network that enables it to take advantage of the growth opportunities, \nand favorable economic and policy developments, in rural areas. It has an important quasi-policy \nthat supports the national priorities of rural vitalization, lending for agriculture development, and \ngreen and inclusive finance. Under the FIL component, it is estimated that 100 loans will be \n \n24 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "9 \nprovided to qualified subborrowers for qualified subprojects. By introducing an environmental and \nsocial management system (ESMS) to its lending operations, ABC is well-positioned to become \na leading green finance bank and set an example that can be replicated and scaled up. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n29.  The  PRC  has  introduced  extensive  laws  and  regulations to  strengthen  government \nfunctions and combat corruption. Local governments at all levels have developed corresponding \nregulations and rules. Although strict laws against corruption are in place, the implementation \nteam will closely monitor the financial management practices of the project participants, which \npotentially pose a high risk. This risk will be mitigated during implementation as specified in the \nrisk assessment and risk management plan (RAMP).26 \n \n30.  Financial management. ADB assessed the financial management of the GMG as the \nexecuting  agency;  of  the  district  and  county  governments  that  implement  the  project  loan \ncomponent; and of ABC as the implementing agency for the FIL component. The assessed pre-\nmitigation  financial  management  risk  is  high,  mainly  because  these  agencies  have  little \nexperience in executing ADB-financed projects. The risk will be mitigated through the financial \nmanagement  action  plan  described  in  the  PAM  (footnote  19).  The  PMO  will  ensure  that \n(i) qualified finance staff are recruited, and clear and adequate organizational and coordination \nmechanisms are used to undertake financial management; (ii) training on ADB\u2019s disbursement \nprocedures, financial management, and monitoring requirements was provided during processing \nand  will  continue  during  implementation;  (iii)  a  uniform  financial  management  system  and \nguidelines are established with assistance from the PIC; and (iv) ADB and the PIC provide \nassistance and training in project management. Risk mitigation measures are in the RAMP.  \n \n31.  ABC, as a regulated and licensed joint stock commercial bank,27 has adequate financial \nmanagement capacity, well-established lending practices, and a leading market share in the \nprovision of services to sannong28 as promoted by the PRC leaders. As a major global and \ndomestic bank, ABC is required by national authorities to hold higher capital buffers to comply \nwith international standards, meet the total loss-absorbing capacity standard, and the regulatory \ncapital requirements set out in the Basel III framework; and is subject to higher supervisory \nexpectations in terms of risk management, risk data aggregation, and risk governance. ABC thus \nhas adequate capacity to manage the FIL component.29 \n \n32.  Procurement. The overall project procurement risk is moderate after mitigation measures \nare undertaken. Strategic procurement planning was carried out to analyze procurement risks, \ndevelop mitigating measures, review options, and agree on procurement arrangements. Project \nprocurement packages consist mainly of works, goods, and services and do not involve any \ntechnical complexity or high-level technology. Procurement arrangements include (i) assigning \nearly  startup  consultants  to  ensure  mobilization  and  procurement  readiness;  (ii)  hiring  a \nprofessional procurement agent to strengthen the capacity of the implementing agencies for ADB \nprocurement procedures; (iii) adopting design, supply, and installation (plant) contracts for the \nconstruction of rural water and wastewater facilities; and (iv) using the nationally advertised open \ncompetitive bidding method for all packages, except for the small and standard packages of goods \nand non-consulting services, which will use the request for quotations method.

Procurement opportunities and results will be \npublished through the national and local electronic procurement portals to ensure transparency. \n \n33.  Integrity and anticorruption policy. Integrity due diligence was conducted on ABC, and \nthe members of its board of directors and senior management.30 They do not appear to constitute \na significant or potentially significant integrity risk. ADB has obtained reasonable assurance that \nABC was not established and is not being used for money laundering or terrorism financing in the \nproject jurisdiction. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the central government and the GMG. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 19). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n34.  Poverty and social. The project is classified as general intervention for poverty reduction. \nA poverty and social analysis was done based on stakeholder consultations and socioeconomic \nsurveys.  It  indicates  that  the  project  will  provide  socioeconomic  development  and  poverty \nreduction opportunities for residents, including low-income households, by increasing their access \nto (i) jobs during project construction and operation, (ii) new jobs in green enterprises, and (iii) a \nbetter living environment. The project will directly benefit 578,138 residents, and other residents \nindirectly through the improved environment and economic opportunities. The project will create \n1,241 jobs during construction and 1,584 jobs during operation. The GMG prepared a social \ndevelopment action plan that includes targeted measures for low-income people. Consultations \nwere held with residents and other stakeholders during project preparation. Consultation and \nparticipation during implementation are mapped out in the PAM. The executing and implementing \nagencies will ensure the implementation, monitoring, and reporting of social measures. \n \n35.  Gender. The social survey shows that more than 70% of young and middle-aged men \nmigrate out of rural areas, so women are the project\u2019s main beneficiaries. The project is classified \nas  effective  gender  mainstreaming  according  to  the  Guidelines  of  Gender  Mainstreaming \nCategories of ADB Projects.31 A gender action plan (GAP) was prepared to ensure that women \nparticipate in and benefit equitably from each output. Women are expected to benefit from better \nemployment and income opportunities, improved living environments and working conditions, and \na better quality of life. The key GAP measures and targets specify that (i) at least 40% of \nparticipants in project consultations and training are women, (ii) at least 30% of project-generated \njobs are made available to women, and (iii) women account for more than 30% of participants in \nproject monitoring. The agencies will ensure GAP implementation, monitoring, and reporting. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n36.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows: \n \n37.  Environment (category B). The initial environmental examination led to an environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP), an ESMS (for the FIL component under output 2), and a project-specific \n \n30 ADB. 2003.

They were based on \napproved  domestic  feasibility  studies,  environmental  assessment  reports,  site  visits,  and \nstakeholder consultations. The consultations included affected people and local government \nagencies, and the outcomes were integrated in the project. The GMG, through the PMO, will be \nresponsible for the implementation of the EMP. ABC, guided by the PMO, will implement the \nESMS. The PMO and the implementing agencies will recruit qualified full-time environment \nofficers and provide training as described in the EMP. The project is expected to improve the \nenvironmental conditions because it (i) reduces wastewater discharge in rural areas; (ii) builds \ncapacity for solid waste management, flood resistance, and soil erosion control; (iii) strengthens \nforest management; (iv) minimizes the use of chemical fertilizers; (v) pilots a framework for green \ndevelopment through the ESMS; and (vi) contributes to better river water quality in the project \nareas. Environmental risks include temporary construction noise, dust, uncontrolled wastewater \nand solid waste disposal, impacts on aquatic habitats, and pollution from wastewater, solid waste, \nand use of agricultural chemicals. Mitigating measures are included in the EMP, while the ESMS \ndefines  the  environmental  management  requirements  for  the  FIL  component.32 The  FIL \ncomponent will only support subprojects categorized B and C for environment. \n \n38.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). The project will occupy 61,379.04 mu of land by \nusing state-owned land (54,656.50 mu) as well as collectively owned land (6,253.01 mu) through \nvoluntary agreements or land leases, and permanently acquiring collective land (469.53 mu). It \nwill temporarily occupy 369.38 mu of land during construction. The land acquisition will impact \n292 households (1,141 individuals) in 34 villages of 29 towns in one project district and five \ncounties. Of these, 51 households (191 individuals) will be significantly affected. No household \nwill be physically displaced. The due diligence for state-owned land and associated facilities \nconfirmed that no outstanding or legacy issues of land acquisition and resettlement exist. A \nresettlement plan was drawn up in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and the \nlaws and regulations of the PRC.33 It includes adequate measures of compensation, resettlement, \nand rehabilitation for affected people. Surveys and consultations with affected people took place \nin preparation of the plan. Affected people will be further consulted during implementation. A \ngrievance redress mechanism was incorporated into the resettlement plan. The plan also includes \ncapacity building for the executing and implementing agencies. The project will engage an \nexternal agency to monitor the implementation. The FIL component will only support subprojects \ncategorized C for involuntary resettlement. Measures to avoid impacts are in the ESMS. \n \n39.  Indigenous  peoples  (category  B).  The  project  will  involve  six  villages  with  a \nconcentration of ethnic minorities, mostly She people. These villages will benefit from the project \nthrough training  and  capacity  building,  jobs, sanitation  services,  ecotourism,  and  improved \nenvironmental and living conditions. The project preparation team carried out an assessment of \nthe potential project impacts on ethnic minorities and prepared an ethnic minority development \nplan.  The  executing  and  implementing  agencies  will  implement  this  plan  and  will  submit \nmonitoring reports to ADB. For the FIL component will only support subprojects categorized B \nand C for indigenous peoples. Measures to safeguard ethnic minorities are included in the ESMS. \n \nG.
