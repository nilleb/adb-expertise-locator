INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of Mongolia requested knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) \nfrom the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support the Mongolian National Audit Office (MNAO). \nThe TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2019\u20132021 for Mongolia.1 The TA \nwill support the MNAO, as Mongolia\u2019s supreme audit institution (SAI), to better monitor the use of \npublic funds. The TA will improve the capacity of the MNAO to conduct financial audits by \nimproving the timeliness  and quality  of  its  audits,  enhancing the  capacity  of  its  staff,  and \nencouraging its use of new technology.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The Mongolian Law on State Audit, 2003 established the MNAO as the country\u2019s supreme \naudit institution. The MNAO reports to the Budget Standing Committee and is mandated to audit \nstate entities. The auditor general, who heads up the MNAO, is appointed for a term of 6 years. \nEach aimag (province) has an audit office headed by a lead auditor who reports directly to the \nauditor general. As the government\u2019s external auditor, the MNAO conducts systems audits and \nreviews transactions. The MNAO covers financial, performance, and compliance audits. The \nnumber of MNAO staff is approved by Parliament and is 389.  The MNAO completes financial \naudits of more than 6,500 budget entities annually. The MNAO is a member of the International \nOrganization  of  Supreme  Audit  Institutions  and  the  Asian  Organization  of  Supreme  Audit \nInstitutions. \n \n3.  Financial audit in Mongolia faces three main challenges. First, statutory requirements \ndictate a broad mandate for the MNAO, which must be delivered with limited numbers of staff. \nThis results in MNAO staff being overworked\u2014In the first half of 2018 MNAO staff accumulated \nmore than 27,000 hours of overtime. To make up for its staff shortage, the MNAO outsources \nmore than one-third of its work to independent auditing firms. However, the government pays low \nfees for this outsourced work, resulting in financial audits of varying quality. \n \n4.  The second challenge is a lack of quality training and professional development. Although \nseveral universities and the Mongolian Institute of Certified Public Accountants (MONICPA) offer \nformal courses, practicing certified public accountants outside of the big four accounting firms \nhave limited access to up-to-date courses and applied training. Auditors outside of the capital, \nUlaanbaatar,  cannot  easily  access  training  because  of  weak  information  technology  (IT) \ninfrastructure and their physical distance from the capital. The audit industry struggles to adopt \ninternational auditing standards because of delays in translation of standards, poor English \nlanguage skills in the audit industry, and a failure to regularly update accounting standards.  \n \n5.  The third challenge is the weakness of MNAO\u2019s IT infrastructure. The accounting software \nused  by  the  MNAO  has  limited  functionality  and  is  not  accessible  to  contracted  private \norganizations. IT hardware is outdated and internet bandwidth is limited, wiping out functionality \nduring peak office hours due to high network traffic. \n \n6.  The strategic vision of the MNAO calls for strengthening its auditing practices, enhancing \nthe capacity of its staff, and building partnerships for a stronger supreme audit function. The \nstrategic vision is underpinned by a recognition of the role that digital technology plays in auditing. \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2018. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2019\u20132021. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 27 March 2019. \n ", "2 \nPrevious support for the MNAO provided by ADB, the World Bank, the National Audit Office of \nthe United Kingdom, and the China National Audit Office laid the foundation for additional projects. \n \n7.  ADB is well-placed to help the MNAO deliver its strategic vision, drawing on previous \nsupport  received  by  the  MNAO.  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  underlines  the  importance  of  using \ninnovative technology and partnerships to solve development problems.3 Auditing is well-suited \nto the application of blockchain, artificial intelligence, big data, and cloud technology. Developing \nproductive auditing partnerships will deliver rich dividends to Mongolia in terms of training and \nsoftware development. In addition, using technology to strengthen public financial management \nbuilds on ADB projects in Mongolia such as the recently approved loan on Strengthening \nInformation  and  Communication  Technology  Systems  for  Efficient  and  Transparent  Public \nInvestment and Tax Administration Project.4 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: more inclusive and sustainable development \nprocess promoted.5 The TA will have the following outcome: auditing of public sector in Mongolia \nmodernized and strengthened.6 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Institutional, organizational, and business processes arrangements in the \nMongolian National Audit Office modernized and improved. The TA will support a systematic \nreview  of  assessments  conducted  by  other  development  partners  of  the  audit  industry  in \nMongolia. The TA will draw on this systematic review to then conduct a review of the business \nprocesses of financial, performance, and compliance audit business processes in Mongolia. On \nthe basis of this review, ADB will consult with independent auditors, the Ministry of Finance, and \nthe Budget Standing Committee of Parliament to prepare a final report on public sector audit \nbusiness processes, identifying where improvements can be made in line with international good \npractices  such  as  the  Supreme  Audit  Institutions  Performance  Measurement  Framework \ndeveloped by the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions.7 The ADB report will \nbe integrated with the strategic plan of the MNAO, and will include a proposed results framework \nwith strategic goals and associated indicators. The final report will recommend institutional, policy, \nand process improvements to enhance the efficiency and quality of the public sector audit \nprocess. Also, under this output, ADB will support the use of an audit manual produced under a \nprevious ADB TA project for Mongolia to improve auditing on projects funded by international \nfinancial institutions.8 \n \n10.  Output 2: Digital master plan and action items for information and communication \ntechnology improvements in auditing and financial management prepared and piloted. \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2018.

Manila. \n ", "3 \nADB will prepare a detailed assessment of IT infrastructure and services in the MNAO, the \nMinistry of Finance\u2019s treasury department, and private audit firms that conduct audits of state \norganizations. Based on this assessment, a digital master plan for improving audit and financial \nmanagement functions for the MNAO will be prepared. The TA will promote automation of audits \nby implementing at least one digital technology application (e.g., blockchain, artificial intelligence, \nbig data, cloud technology) to the public sector audit process in Mongolia. This output, which will \ncommence after the completion of output 1, will fully reflect the findings from the systematic review \nof output 1. \n \n11.  Output 3: Sustainable capacity development of auditors established. Building on the \nMNAO\u2019s learning and development frameworks, the TA will support establishing a partnership \nbetween the MNAO and Mongolian universities and/or MONICPA to develop a core series of \nauditing modules. ADB resources will be used to develop the initial modules and the MNAO will \nmaintain and update these modules (by using their own budget or by entering into a partnership \nwith an organization such as MONICPA). These modules will be made available to auditors in the \npublic and private sectors, and support will be sought from major private sector auditors, peer \nsupreme audit institutions, and/or regional and international audit institutions to ensure quality in \nline with international standards. ADB will also support on-the-job training for MNAO staff to apply \nthe lessons of the audit modules. A training-of-trainer approach will be used and will be hardwired \ninto the MNAO learning and development frameworks to ensure that lessons and knowledge are \npassed on from trained staff. The TA will support the MNAO top management on change \nmanagement to prepare them to champion the partnerships, business process changes, and \ntechnological adaptations fostered under the TA. \n \n12.  Across these outputs, the TA project will emphasize sustainability so that that the skills \ndeveloped to produce the indicators remain within the Mongolian government. ADB will also \nexplore the use of partnerships with other institutions to ensure that the benefits of the TA enrich \nnot only the government but also Mongolia\u2019s entire auditing industry. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,250,000, of which (i) $650,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6); and (ii) $500,000 will be financed \non  a  grant  basis  by  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge  Partnership  Fund  and \nadministered by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \n14.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff \nremuneration, office accommodation, office supplies, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented from 20 May 2019 to 31 December 2021. The MNAO will be \nthe executing agency and the implementing agency. The Mongolia Resident Mission will lead the \nTA and will take a one-ADB approach in this TA by working closely with relevant ADB departments. \nThe MNAO will form a working group for each output. The group\u2019s proposed composition will be \nsent to ADB for no-objection approval prior to its formation. ADB will engage national consultants \nto act as secretaries for each group. The consultants will be responsible for organizing and \ndelivering training in relation to each output so that the MNAO and other government staff have \nthe capacity to implement the project outputs beyond the lifetime of the project. There will be at \nleast three workshops (inception, midterm, and final) in addition to the training. \n \n ", "4 \n16.  TA support for workshops may include costs related to the venue, equipment rental, \ntranslation, printing and copying, meals, transport, lodging, logistics and administrative support, \nand other expenditures with prior agreement from ADB. In line with standard ADB procedures, \nthe TA will not support the executing agency\u2019s management fees or related costs such as staff \nsalaries  and  allowances,  and  the  use  of  executing  agency  resources  such  as  office \naccommodation, which will be provided as part of the counterpart contribution. The TA will include \none study tour for six government staff for no more than 5 working days to demonstrate best \npractices in the application of digital technology to auditing.9 \n \n17.  The executing agency will provide office space and additional equipment. It will also \nprovide access to utilities and telecommunication, including a broadband internet connection, for \nindividual consultants. It will supply data and documents as required under the TA and will cover \nthe cost of office utilities for consultants. To maximize the effectiveness of TA activities, the \nexecuting agency will designate a TA focal point with strong English speaking and writing skills to \nfacilitate TA activities and links to local government representatives and other stakeholders. \n \n18.  The executing agency will establish a separate advance payment facility in United States \ndollars at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB in coordination with the Ministry of Finance in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). This will be used to pay for workshop and training costs, survey costs, report \npublication costs, a study tour, and equipment costs. The executing agency is assessed as having \nthe financial management capacity and internal controls to maintain records. \n \n19.
