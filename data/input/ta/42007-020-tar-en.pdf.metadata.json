The Government of Uzbekistan has requested policy-based programmatic lending totaling \n$200 million from Asian Development Bank (ADB) concessional ordinary capital resources to \nsupport reforms to improve the enabling environment for small and medium-sized enterprise \n(SME) development. The reforms under the Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Development \nProgram are sequenced across two subprograms.1 The program is aligned with the government\u2019s \nobjective  of  increasing employment  and  real  incomes  across regions  of  the  country.2 The \nexpected  outcome  of  the  program  is  an  improved  enabling  environment  for  SME  growth, \ndiversification, and high-value-added job creation. The reform areas underlying the outcome are: \n(i) diversification of formal bank and nonbank financing instruments, (ii) reducing the institutional \nand administrative costs of doing business, (iii) improving trade facilitation and digitalization, and \n(iv) aligning skills development with market needs. The effect of the reforms will be diversified \neconomic growth and high-value-added jobs. The program and the technical assistance (TA) are \nincluded in the country operations business plan for Uzbekistan, 2021\u20132023.3 \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Justification \n \n2.   ADB has supported SMEs and microenterprises in Uzbekistan since 1996, primarily \nthrough loans and TA. The focus has been on financing working capital and the acquisition of \nfixed assets and improving the financial and technical capacity of the participating financial \ninstitutions to serve SMEs better. Implementation lessons show that access to finance is only one \nof several key constraints to SME development in the country. Hence, ADB should complement \nits credit lines (financial intermediation loans) with policy-based operations to catalyze critical \nsectoral, policy, and institutional reforms. Cross-cutting reforms are critical for SMEs to join the \nformal economy and create high-value-added jobs across a range of sectors. \n \n3.  Uzbekistan\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) averaged 6.2% during 2010\u20132020, with GDP \n \ngrowth slowing to 1.6% in 2020 because of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.4 This \ngrowth has been accompanied by rising incomes of SMEs and microenterprises, regular minimum \nwage increases, and social safety nets to cushion the impacts of structural reforms underway \nsince  2017.  Supported  by  government  policy  to  develop  the  private  sector,  the  role  and \ncontribution of SMEs in the economy has been expanding.5 About 411,203 SMEs were registered \nand active at the end of 2020, up 4% from 2019. SMEs accounted for 54% of GDP during 2019\u2013\n2020, contributing  97% in agriculture, 82% in trade, 72% in construction, and 52% in services. \nSMEs accounted for 27% of exports and 62% of imports in 2020. They are the largest employers \nand provided 78% of formal and informal jobs combined in 2018, up from 50% in 2000.6 \n \n4.  SME development and state-owned enterprise reform, key pillars of the government\u2019s \nprivate sector development strategy, are being undertaken in parallel in Uzbekistan. Since 2017, \n \n1 The program will have two single-tranche policy-based loans of $100 million each. The indicative implementation \nperiods of the two subprograms are January\u2013September 2021 for subprogram 1 and October 2021\u2013December 2023 \nfor subprogram 2.  \n2  Presidential Decree No. 4947, On the Strategy of Actions for Further Development of Uzbekistan (2017). \n3  ADB. 2020.

In the Doing Business 2020 \nreport, the country ranked 69th globally, up from 76th place in 2018, with higher scores than the \nprevious year in nine of the 10 assessment criteria.7 Commencing in January 2019, tax system \ndistortions that unfairly burdened small businesses were removed. Trading across borders was \neased  using  risk-based  inspections,  simplifying  import  documentary  requirements,  and \nharmonizing  19,000  out  of  30,000  internal technical  regulation,  certification,  and  metrology \nstandards with international norms to improve product quality and enter world markets. Given the \nsevere impact of COVID-19 on SMEs in Uzbekistan, the government is keen to further reform the \nSME enabling environment to prevent the reversal of gains in SME development, which have \nfueled economic growth, and increase SMEs' resilience to future economic shocks.8   \n \n5.  The government requested TA to support government initiatives to implement critical \nreforms in selected areas of the Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Development Program.9 \nThe results framework, implementation arrangements, cost estimate, and scope of the TA, in \nrelation to the proposed program, were discussed with the government during consultation \nmeetings for the policy-based loan.  \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n6.  Output 1: Operation and governance of the guarantee scheme under the State Fund \nfor Support of Entrepreneurship strengthened. This output will support implementation of \nreforms in the institutional structure and the operational and governance framework in the existing \npartial credit guarantee scheme (PCG) to ensure financial sustainability, appropriate outreach, \nand increased access to credit. This will include developing, based on international good practices: \n(i) eligibility criteria for participating financial institutions and SMEs; (ii) a risk management \nframework including credit risk assessment of SMEs and exposure limits per sector, region, and \nparticipating financial institution; (iii) a governance framework; (iv) pricing and fee policy; (v) an \noperational framework; (vi) a guarantee procedure and claims management process; and (vii) a \nmonitoring and evaluation system including independent auditing. The required legal/regulatory \nframework will also be assessed. These changes will be based on recommendations from the \nqualitative and quantitative analysis undertaken by the State Fund, with support of ADB, in 2020. \n \n7.  Output  2:  Institutional  structure  and  operations  of  the  Entrepreneurship \nDevelopment Agency rationalized and improved. This output will help improve the operations \nand efficiency of the Entrepreneurship Development Agency (EDA). This will include support for \n(i) implementing the SME development strategy in line with the government\u2019s development \nstrategy (footnote 2); (ii) long-term financial planning to ensure that the agency would not be at \nrisk in the event of a change of government; (iii) operationalizing a system for collecting and \nanalyzing sex-disaggregated data to better target policy interventions for SMEs in a specific group, \nsector, size, or class; and (iv) enhancing the quality and legitimacy of its services by including on \n \n7  World Bank. 2020. Doing Business 2020: Comparing Business Regulation in 190 Economies. Washington, DC. \n8  SMEs experienced a sharp decline in sales and depletion of cash reserves because of the pandemic and associated \nlockdowns, especially from March to October 2020. More than half of SMEs (52.7%) experienced a decline in demand \nfor their products and 62.2% suffered a revenue decline. The number of permanent personnel of SMEs declined by \n6.3% from March to October 2020, and 34.7% of SMEs had to lay off staff. Most of the employment reduction was \nby SMEs in manufacturing, furniture, textiles, apparel, leather products and rendering, accommodation, catering, \nentertainment, transportation and storage, education and science, construction and building materials, plumbing, and \ntrade. The aggregate unemployment rate rose from 9.0% in 2019 to 10.5% in 2020. The decline in demand for SMEs\u2019 \nproducts, and related decline in revenues, in urban areas was more severe compared with rural areas. Nearly 60% \nof SME exporters either reduced or stopped their exports during the pandemic. Exports in services and construction \nwere hit hardest, followed by agriculture, trade, and industry. \n9  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 25 December 2021. \n \n ", "     3 \nits decision-making bodies representatives from financial institutions, universities, technology \ncenters, business associations, and other stakeholders. \n \n8.  Output 3. Uptake of digitalization and eco-Innovation in small and medium-sized \nenterprises increased. This output will strengthen the capacity of the Department of Nonfinancial \nSupport to Entrepreneurship under EDA to support (i) increased digitalization of SMEs, and (ii) \nadoption of green technologies through \"soft\" interventions (i.e., nonfinancial, such as advice, \ntraining, and networking) and \"hard\" interventions (i.e., financial).10 For (i), EDA will establish a \nformal coordination mechanism with IT-Park Uzbekistan to raise SMEs\u2019 awareness of the benefits \nof adopting digitalized solutions and applying a broad range of technologies for different purposes \n(e.g., to enable greater access to markets and end-users; to integrate business processes; to \nimprove customer service and relationship management; to improve supply chain management; \nto increase business visibility; to implement electronic invoicing; to implement incubation and \nacceleration programs for local information technology (IT) startups; and to access public and \nprivate venture funds, info-education, startup hackathons, and other events). EDA will also \ndevelop a platform for expertise and knowledge transfer by mapping companies that have \nsuccessfully digitalized their processes and services. For (ii), EDA will provide assistance to link \nSMEs to advice, training, and networking to improve their understanding of the links between \nbusiness and the environment and the costs, benefits, and resources available to help them \novercome barriers in adopting green technologies. EDA will also develop mechanisms to support \nthe State Fund to finance digitalization and SME investments in green technologies (such as \nthermal  insulation,  photovoltaic  solar  panels,  geothermal  heat  pumps,  and  water-efficient \nirrigation systems). \n \n9.  Output 4. Action plan for implementing International Financial Reporting Standards \nfor SMEs developed. This output will support the Ministry of Finance to develop a detailed action \nplan to implement International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for SMEs, as required \nunder Government Resolution No. 4611 (adopted in 2020).11 IFRS for SMEs will strengthen \nSMEs' financial management and reporting capacity and improve their access to finance. The TA \nwill undertake assessments to identify gaps between IFRS for SMEs and national accounting \nstandards for SMEs. Workshops and webinars will be undertaken to (i) train the trainers in using \nIFRS for SMEs training material, and (ii) train accountants and specialists to apply IFRS for SMEs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The TA is estimated to cost $265,000, of which $250,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 7). The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 1. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, \noffice  accommodation,  inter-agency  coordination,  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  The \ngovernment was informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing \nproject. \n \n10 In accordance with the Digital Uzbekistan\u20132030 strategy, passed in 2021, the government is prioritizing the \ndevelopment of information technology entrepreneurship, particularly youth entrepreneurship. The government has \nallocated financing for stable and high\u2010speed internet access, development of business infrastructure, and adequate \noffice premises. A network of coworking office spaces is also being established in every region of the country to \nprovide entrepreneurs with digital communication infrastructure.  \n11 IFRS for SMEs are a set of accounting standards developed by the International Accounting Standards Board \ndesigned for SMEs for general purpose financial statements and reporting to lenders and government authorities. \nJoint-stock companies, commercial banks, insurance organizations and legal entities classified as large taxpayers \nand business entities with a state share and state-owned enterprises approved by the State Assets Management \nAgency are required to prepare financial statements applying IFRS Standards. Other companies may voluntarily \nprepare financial statements applying IFRS Standards. For SMEs, reporting as per national standards is required. \n \n ", "4      \n \nD.
