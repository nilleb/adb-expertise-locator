I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Kingdom of Tonga for the additional financing of the \nOuter Island Renewable Energy Project.1 \n \n2.  The proposed additional financing will support the scaling up of the current project by \nupgrading the existing power distribution grid in the islands of Vava\u2019u and 'Eua, which will result \nin additional savings of about 0.12 million liters of diesel per year. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Tonga is a kingdom of 177 islands divided into five island groups: 'Eua, Ha'apai, Niuas, \nTongatapu, and Vava'u. Its 103,000 people inhabit about 36 of these islands. The peak demand \nof the four Tonga Power Limited (TPL) grids in 2016 was about 11.1 megawatts, and yearly \ndemand  totaled  about  55  gigawatt-hours.2 An  estimated  13  million  liters  of  diesel  were \nconsumed to generate this electricity at a cost that was equivalent to about 10% of the year\u2019s \ntotal gross domestic product and about 15% of the total value of imports. Peak demand is \nexpected to increase to 17.2 megawatts by 2020. Petroleum dependency makes Tonga highly \nvulnerable to oil price shocks, which affect the affordability of food, goods, electricity, and \ntransport. \n \n4.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the original Outer Island Renewable \nEnergy Project on 27 June 2013 to reduce Tonga\u2019s dependence on imported fossil fuel for \npower generation and give consumers greater access at a reduced cost to electricity generated \nby solar power. The original project became effective in June 2014. The original project planned \nto (i) construct and install solar power systems with a total capacity of 1.32 megawatt-peak; (ii) \nprovide  operation  and  maintenance  training  and  knowledge  transfer  to  the  implementing \nagencies for at least 5 years after commissioning of the solar systems, including development of \na program manual for operation and maintenance of solar generation and distribution systems; \nand (iii) assist the implementing agencies to implement the project in an efficient and effective \nmanner by recruiting project management consultants for at least 5 years after commissioning \nof the solar systems. \n \n5.  The original project encountered initial implementation delays for a variety of reasons, \nincluding significant damage caused by the most powerful storm ever recorded in Tonga.3 \nFollowing the devastation caused when Cyclone Ian passed directly over the northeast islands \nof Ha\u2019apai in January 2014, the government requested a temporary suspension of project \nactivities so that it could focus on emergency assistance needed to reconstruct and strengthen \nthe damaged electricity network and school facilities on the island group. After ADB approved \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. ADB. 2013. Report and Recommendation of the President \nto the Board of Directors: Proposed Grant and Administration of Grant to the Kingdom of Tonga for the Outer Island \nRenewable Energy Project. Manila. \n2  TPL is a vertically integrated government-owned public enterprise under the oversight of the Ministry of Public \nEnterprises and the government\u2019s cabinet.  \n3  Cyclone Ian was a category 5 system, with winds of more than 200 kilometers per hour and gusts of about 300 \nkilometers per hour. About 5,000 people were directly affected\u201466% of Ha\u2019apai\u2019s population. According to TPL, \nthe cyclone damaged 90% of the Ha\u2019apai power network\u2019s distribution lines, 40% of the high-voltage poles, 70% of \nthe low-voltage poles, 65% of the transformers, 90% of the transformer structures, one of the two generators, and \n95% of the streetlights. \n ", "2 \n \nthe Cyclone Ian Recovery Project in May 2014, activities on the original project resumed, and \nthe government requested ADB\u2019s support to rehabilitate TPL\u2019s power distribution system on \n\u2018Eua and Vava\u2019u. 4   \n \n6.  The power distribution system (grid) is part of the electricity supply chain and requires \nconsiderable  investment  and  operation  and  maintenance  efforts.  Power  distribution  assets \ntypically represent 20%\u201330% of the required power system investments in electricity industries \nworldwide, but this figure rises to about 42% for TPL. The standard losses in rural power \ndistribution networks are generally about 5%, yet the rate is more than twice as high in Tonga at \naround 13%. Greater losses mean that more fuel is consumed in power generation, which \nmakes improving the efficiency of the country\u2019s power system a matter of paramount importance \nfor the government. \n \n7.  To address dual challenges of reducing high technical losses and incorporating climate \nresilience features for the grids in the outer islands of Tonga, ADB approved the first additional \nfinancing on 20 October 2015, which became effective on 30 November 2015. Under the first \nadditional financing, 80% of the existing grid network on \u2018Eua and 20% of existing grid network \non Vava\u2019u are being rehabilitated and upgraded. 5 The current project, 6  especially the grid-\nrehabilitation  component,  will  allow  Tonga  to  reduce  power  distribution  losses  and  fuel \nconsumption while delivering the same amount of electricity to consumers; and improve the \nclimate  resilience  feature  of  TPL\u2019s  grids.  This  will  be  achieved  by  rehabilitating  old  and \ninefficient grid assets, i.e., cables, poles, distribution transformers, and switchgears.  \n \n8.  To expand the scale of the current project and deliver increased benefits by reducing \npower distribution losses, the government has asked ADB for a loan and a grant of $2.5 million \neach from ADB\u2019s Special Funds (Asian Development Fund) resources7 to expand the ongoing \ngrid network upgrading and rehabilitation works in (i) \u2018Eua from 80% to 100% of the existing grid \nnetwork; and (ii) Vava\u2019u from 20% to 50% of the existing grid network.8 \n \n9.  The current project meets all the eligibility criteria for additional financing. Despite the \ndelays, the progress made on project implementation since effectiveness has been satisfactory \noverall. The project currently faces no major risks to a successful delivery of its expected \noutputs  or  to  keeping  to  its  revised  implementation  schedule.  As  of  September  2016,  (i) \ncumulative contract awards for the current project is at $9.8 million, or 80.0% of ADB financing; \nand (ii) cumulative disbursements for the current project has reached $4.3 million, or 30% of \nADB financing. The current project has also conducted all necessary safeguards due diligence \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2014. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Grant and \nAdministration of Grant to the Kingdom of Tonga for the Cyclone Ian Recovery Project. Manila. Overall progress of \nrehabilitating the electricity network on Ha\u2019apai has been satisfactory. \n5 ADB. 2015. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Grant and \nAdministration of Grant for Additional Financing to the Kingdom of Tonga for the Outer Island Renewable Energy \nProject. Manila. ADB and the Second Danish Cooperation Fund for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency for \nRural Areas  provided $2.19 million and the European Union provided \u20ac3.00 million, all on a grant basis. TPL will \nprovide $0.67 million as an in-kind contribution. \n6  The current project includes the original project and the first additional financing. \n7  A country's eligibility for Asian Development Fund (Special Fund resources) grants under ADB\u2019s revised grant \nframework is determined by its risk of debt distress. The latest debt sustainability analysis in 2014 determined that \nTonga had a high risk of debt distress and was therefore eligible to receive 50:50 of its Asian Development Fund \nallocation as a loan and a grant. \n8  The first additional financing only covers 80% of existing grid networks on \u2018Eua and 20% of existing grid networks \non Vava\u2019u due to the limited Asian Development Fund allocation for Tonga in 2015. In early 2016, the government \nrequested to allocate some remaining 2016 Asian Development Fund allocation to expand the project scope on \nboth islands. ", "    3 \n \nand is noted to be in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). Since the third \nquarter of 2015, the current project has been rated on track in the project performance rating \nsystem and is, therefore, considered to be a well-performing project.9 Project performance and \nassociated issues are described in more detail in the summary of project performance.10 \n \n10.  The additional financing is in line with the objectives of ADB\u2019s 2009 Energy Policy to \npromote energy efficiency and renewable energy; provide access to energy for all; and support \nreform, capacity building, and improved governance in the energy sector.11 It is included in \nADB\u2019s Tonga draft Country Operations Business Plan, 2017\u20132019, which makes energy a \npriority area of support and sets a primary goal of reducing the country\u2019s dependence on \nimported fossil fuels through energy efficiency and conservation operations, including support \nfor power generation from renewable energy sources. 12 \n \n11.  The overall project will remain technically, financially, and economically viable with the \nadditional financing component. The safeguards categorization of the overall project will also \nremain  unchanged.  The  additional  financing  component  will  enhance  the  current  project\u2019s \noriginal design and add effective support for its development of the solar photovoltaic plants\u2014\none of the government\u2019s key priorities. The additional financing component will enhance the \nimpact and outcome of the project, as well as ADB\u2019s contribution to power sector development \nin Tonga. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact and outcome of the overall project will remain unchanged with the additional \nfinancing. The intended impact will remain the reduction of Tonga\u2019s dependence on imported \nfossil fuel for power generation. The outcome of the overall project will be the optimization of on-\ngrid  and  off-grid  generation  systems  to  provide  increased  consumer  access  to  electricity \ngenerated by solar power at a reduced cost. \n \nC.  Outputs \n13.  Output 1 under the current project is the construction and installation of solar power \nsystems with a total capacity of 1.32 megawatt-peak on nine outer islands and the rehabilitation \nby TPL of the existing grid network on the islands of Vava\u2019u and \u2018Eua by replacing cables, poles, \ndistribution transformers, switchgears, and other equipment. Under the proposed additional \nfinancing, the rehabilitation by TPL of the existing grid network will be expanded in (i) \u2018Eua from \n80% to 100% of the existing grid network and (ii) Vava\u2019u from 20% to 50% of the existing grid \nnetwork. The current output 2 and output 3 will remain unchanged with the additional financing. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n14.  The additional financing will be provided through a loan of SDR1.809 million ($2.5 million \nequivalent) and a grant of $2.5 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources as well as an \nadditional contribution from TPL of $0.60 million. This will raise investments by about 42% from \n                                                \n9 ADB. 2011. Additional Financing. Operations Manual. OM H5/OP. Manila.

The government has requested an additional (i) loan in various currencies equivalent to \nSDR1.809 million, ($2.5 million equivalent); and (ii) grant not exceeding $2.50 million equivalent, \nboth from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance the project.13 \nThe loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter (the interest during construction as \napplicable to be capitalized in the loan), and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nfinancing and project agreements.  \n \n16.  Tonga  is  an  Asian  Development  Fund  50:50  (loan:  grant)  eligible  country.  The  grid \nrehabilitation work in outer islands is largely driven by the government\u2019s priority to (i) reduce \nTonga\u2019s fuel consumption for power generation by reducing technical losses; (ii) improve the \noverall climate resilience features of Tonga\u2019s power distribution network; and (iii) extend the \nnetwork rehabilitation to remote parts of the country. TPL would be unlikely to undertake the \nproposed grid rehabilitation on a commercial basis as it offers only marginal commercial incentive. \nTherefore, the government has decided to provide the loan and grant proceeds to TPL as a grant \nand will make the proceeds of the loan and grant available to TPL under a subsidiary financing \nagreement upon terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB.14 The revised financing plan is in Table \n2. \n                                                \n13 Additional Financing will cover the cost of all works and associated services for upgrading the existing power \ndistribution networks.  \n14 A new subsidiary financing agreement is expected to be signed after approval of the proposed additional financing. \nIn addition to the proposed additional financing, the government also requested for ADB\u2019s funding support of $8.0 \nmillion in grant and loan for TPL\u2019s proposed 6-megawatt solar project development. However, since this will be a \ncommercially driven project, the government will on-lend the entire $8.0 million to TPL as 100% loan. This funding \nis expected to be processed in 2017.

The overall project has been assessed as technically viable based on extensive study of \nthe load and energy demand records provided by TPL and field investigations, as well as on \nexperience from the current project and ADB\u2019s Cyclone Ian Recovery Project. The selection of \nequipment has been carefully analyzed based on best engineering practices. The equipment is \nspecifically designed for hard marine environments and remote island conditions. ADB and the \nimplementing  agency  quantified  the  equipment  necessary  for  the  network  refurbishment, \nassessed the grid condition, and calculated the potential reduction in grid power losses. The \nequipment will incorporate adequate climate-proofing measures to increase resilience to climate \nand disaster risks throughout the project lifecycle. ", "    7 \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n20.  The proposed power distribution network to be funded by the additional financing is \nconsidered financially viable because the estimated financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of \n(4.69%) is greater than the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 4.13%. The overall \nproject is considered to be financially feasible since the FIRR is 4.30%, greater than the WACC \n(3.60%). The overall project was financially feasible under all the scenarios tested, with the \nFIRR remaining greater than WACC or very close to WACC.16  \n \n21.  The additional financing is also considered economically viable, since the estimated \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 10.39% is within the acceptable level between 10% \nand 12%, with unvalued benefits that are expected to exceed unvalued costs. The EIRR of \n12.25% for the overall project including the proposed additional financing is greater than the \neconomic discount rate of 12%. Under several adverse scenarios during sensitivity testing, the \noverall  project  has  maintained  an  acceptable  level  of  EIRR  between  10%  and  12%  with \nunvalued benefits that are expected to exceed unvalued costs. Thus, the project is considered \neconomically feasible.  \n \nC.  Governance \n22.  Financial  management.  To  facilitate  cash  flow  during  project  implementation,  the \nMFNP,  as  the  executing  agency,  will  approve  withdrawal  applications  from  the  project \nmanagement unit and submit them to ADB for direct payment for all project goods, works, and \nconsultancy  services.  A  public  financial  management  performance  assessment  under  the \noriginal project concluded that Tonga\u2019s public financial management system is based on a \nsound legal and regulatory framework and underpinned by a set of well-established expenditure \ncontrol procedures that cover wages and salaries, non-salary items, and procurement.17 \n \n23.

The  project  management  consultant  has  assisted  the  implementing \nagencies  in  procuring  all  project  goods,  works,  and  services  under  the  current  project. \nProcurement of goods, works, and related services under the additional financing project will be \ncarried out by TPL, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from \ntime to time). In addition to international competitive bidding, national competitive bidding, and \nshopping  methods,  direct  contracting  and  force  account  methods  will  be  used  for  some \npackages to be funded by the additional financing. Direct contracting with the existing contractor \nwill be used for procurement of electric equipment to ensure compatibility with the existing \nequipment, such as cables and transformers. Direct contracting will also minimize the time for \nthe supply and delivery of equipment and its subsequent installation by TPL. Completion of 20% \nof the remaining works will ensure the timely commissioning of the grid to supply power to the \npopulation  of  the  outer  islands.  The  proposed  additional  grant  and  loan  will  finance  the \nincremental labor costs of TPL to carry out construction and rehabilitation of high-voltage and \nlow-voltage  power  distribution  network  on  \u2018Eua  and  Vava\u2019u  islands.  The  force  account  is \nproposed because the number of works is small (about $0.40 million) and scattered across the \nislands. TPL has been successfully implementing similar works under previous projects and it is \ncapable of carrying out the construction without disrupting the grid's functioning. The use of \n                                                \n16 While the FIRRs are below the WACC under a couple sensitivity cases, the EIRRs of the overall project are on \nfeasible levels, and are considered justified on economic grounds. \n17 Government of Tonga. 2010. Public Financial Management Performance Report. Nuku\u2019alofa. ", "8 \n \ndirect  contracting  and  force  account  has  been  justified  based  on  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines.18 \n \n24.  Advance contracting for some packages using international competitive bidding, national \ncompetitive bidding, shopping, and direct contracting methods will be undertaken in conformity \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). The executing \nagency and implementing agencies have been advised that approval of advance contracting \ndoes not commit ADB to finance the project. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) was explained to and discussed with the government, MFNP, and TPL. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n25.  The primary beneficiaries of the overall project will be the people of the outer islands of \nTonga who will benefit from an alternative, cheap, and reliable means of power supply. They will \ninclude low-income households relying on existing lifeline electricity tariffs. Under the proposed \nadditional financing, the people of \u2018Eua and Vava\u2019u will particularly gain from reliable electricity \nsupply. It is expected to result in more efficient electricity consumption and provide incentives to \nhouseholds  and  local  businesses  to  maximize  power  supply  for  income-generating  and \nproductive  activities.  Provision  of  social  services,  such  as  health  and  education,  are  also \nexpected to improve through consistent power supply. \n \n26.  Rural  women  in  Tonga  perform  multiple  roles  often  with  limited  resources  and \nchallenging  work  environments,  such  as  lack  of  access  to  electricity.  The  provision  of  an \naffordable, reliable power supply to beneficiary households will enable women to perform their \nroles more efficiently. The women\u2019s lack of opportunities for paid employment (51% women \nemployment in \u2018Eua and 53% in Vava\u2019u) would also be potentially addressed by growth in \nenterprises dependent on reliable electricity supply and employment opportunities during project \nimplementation. The  activities  proposed  under the  additional financing  will  not  require  any \nchanges to the existing gender action plan of the overall project, which is categorized as \neffective gender mainstreaming. The project management consultant with the assistance from \nthe gender focal points from TPL and the Ministry of Meteorology, Energy, Information, Disaster \nManagement, Climate Change, and Communications will continue to satisfactorily implement \nthe  proposed  activities  and  targets  under  the  gender  action  plan.19 TPL  has  successfully \nbrought to the current project sites, 8 women out of 15 trained workers. Four of these women \npreviously completed the same tasks on Ha\u2019apai under the Cyclone Ian Recovery Project. TPL\u2019s \neffort  may  create  a  long-term  employment  opportunity  for  these  female  workers.  The \nimplementation progress of the gender action plan will continue to be reported quarterly to ADB \nand the government.  \n \n \n \n                                                \n18 The guidelines state, in paras. 3.6 to 3.8, that for direct contracting, (i) no better offer is likely to be received, and \nthat the price to be paid is not more than the original price; and (ii) standardization of equipment or spare parts, to \nbe compatible with existing equipment, may justify additional purchases from the original supplier. Under the \nguidelines, the use of force account can be justified when (i) quantities of work involved cannot be defined in \nadvance, (ii) works are small and scattered or in remote locations and qualified construction firms are unlikely to bid \non them at reasonable prices, (iii) work is required to be carried out without disrupting ongoing operations, and (iv) \nthe risks of unavoidable work interruption are better borne by the recipient or implementing agency than by a \ncontractor. \n19 It will actively promote the involvement of women in employment such as hiring at least 30% women in local \nconstruction contracts and 50% female participation in training rolled out during project implementation.  ", "    9 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n27.  Environment. The two areas to be affected by activities under the additional financing \nare  classified  as  category  B  for  the  environment.  Initial  environmental  examinations  were \nprepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  No  significant \nenvironmental impacts will result from the implementation of the overall project. \n \n28.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The proposed additional financing \nis category C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples per ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009). The increased rehabilitation of the grid in \u2018Eua and Vava\u2019u will be carried out \nthrough the replacement of existing power distribution assets located on public land. The due \ndiligence, including stakeholder consultations, confirmed that it will not require any additional \nland, displace people, and impact on any assets and livelihood. No distinct and vulnerable \nindigenous peoples will be affected. All the activities in the overall project will be implemented in \na culturally appropriate and participatory manner. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n29.  No significant issues are expected to arise in implementing the overall project. Key risks \nand mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management \nplan.20 \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES  \n30.  The government, the MFNP, and TPL have assured ADB that implementation of the \nproject shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual and the  loan and grant documents. \n \n31.  The government, the MFNP, and TPL have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for \nthe project, which are set forth in the financing agreement and project agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n32.
