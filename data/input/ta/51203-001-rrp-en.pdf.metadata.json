THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $50,000,000 (or in Sri Lanka rupee equivalent) to DFCC Bank PLC (DFCC) for Improving \nAccess to Finance for Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprises in Sri Lanka. \n \n2.  The project entails the Asian Development Bank (ADB) providing longer-term financing to \nDFCC, a leading bank in Sri Lanka, for onlending to micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises \n(MSMEs). ADB\u2019s financing will meet DFCC\u2019s funding requirements for medium-term funding, \nwhich is in short supply. This will enable the bank to provide longer-tenor MSME loans and help \nthe bank diversify its funding sources. \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n3.  Banking sector overview. The banking sector in Sri Lanka consists of seven licensed \nspecialized banks (LSBs) and 25 licensed commercial banks (LCBs),1 of which 13 are categorized \nas domestic banks and 12 are foreign banks.2 The banking sector has experienced rapid growth \nsince the end of the civil war in 2009. From 2009 to 2016, gross loans grew at an annual rate of \n19.5%. Total bank deposits grew at a slower pace of 16.0% per annum during the same period. \nThe  banking  sector\u2019s  asset  quality  has  improved  consistently  since  a  peaking  of  the \nnonperforming loan (NPL) ratio in 2013. The gross NPL ratio decreased from 3.2% at the end of \n2015 to 2.6% at the end of 2016 and then increased marginally to 2.7% in Q3 2017. The banking \nsector is sufficiently capitalized, with capital adequacy levels remaining largely stable since 2015. \nAt the end of Q3 2017, the total capital adequacy ratio (CAR) was 15.2%, compared with 15.6% \nat the end of 2016 and 15.4% at the end of 2015. In July 2017, Central Bank of Sri Lanka \nintroduced the Basel III regulatory regime. To comply with the new requirements, several banks \nare strengthening capital, primarily via a combination of rights issues, subordinated bonds, and \nmore  conservative  dividend  policies.  Sector  profitability  is  stable  and  has  been  growing \nconsistently since 2009. In 2016, the profit after tax for the sector increased by 19.9% over the \nprevious year, driven by lower operating costs and better asset quality and leading to lower \nprovisions. Net profits continued growing by 20.3% in the first 9 months of 2017 (compared to the \ncorresponding period in 2016) because of lower operating costs. \n \n4.  Access to finance by micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. MSMEs are an \nimportant part of the Sri Lankan economy. In 2013, they accounted for 35% of total employment, \n30% of gross domestic product, and 20% of total exports, and they accounted for 99.5% of all \nenterprises in the country.3 Although Sri Lanka has many banks and nonbank financial institutions \n(NBFIs), access to credit remains a major issue. A 2011 study by the International Finance \nCorporation listed difficulties in obtaining bank finance as one of the top five constraints to the \ndevelopment and expansion of MSMEs in Sri Lanka.4 Studies also revealed that the difficulties \nthat small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have in accessing credit in Sri Lanka are the \n                                                \n1  The Central Bank of Sri Lanka issues banking licenses for two categories of banks: LCBs and LSBs. LCBs are \npermitted to accept demand deposits from the public and can act as authorized dealers in foreign exchange. LSBs \ncannot do either activity. \n2  Sector Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n3  N. Yoshino and F. Taghizadeh-Hesary. 2017.

Tokyo: ADB Institute. \n4  International Finance Corporation. 2011. Enterprise Surveys: Sri Lanka Country Profile 2011. Washington, DC  \n \n ", "2 \n \nresult of (i) shortcomings within SMEs, including poor financial literacy, lack of market knowledge, \nand lack of transparency; (ii) shortcomings within financial institutions, including a risk-averse \nbanking culture, heavy reliance on collateral, and lack of understanding of genuine SME-oriented \nbanking  practices;  and  (iii)  shortcomings  within  market  infrastructure,  including  insufficient \nmechanisms to improve information asymmetries in SME banking.5 The Government of Sri Lanka \nidentified three major problems affecting MSMEs\u2019 access to finance: (i) unavailability of funds and \nother  credit  instruments;  (ii)  limited  access  to  equity  and  loan  capital;  and  (iii)  financial \nmismanagement.6 As a result, the government has introduced a number of SME finance initiatives \nto  address  these  problems.  Over  the  years,  the  country  has  also  improved  its  market \ninfrastructure for MSME finance, including the establishment of a credit bureau, the introduction \nof an electronic searchable collateral registry, increased reliability of property rights, and a \nfunctioning bankruptcy and insolvency system. Hence, despite challenges in lending to MSMEs, \nmore financial institutions have started to focus on MSME lending and have been expanding their \nnetwork and accessibility throughout the country. \n5.  Investment rationale. ADB has been active in Sri Lanka in the finance sector providing \ncritically needed medium- and long-tenor funding to a variety of financial institutions. Through its \nnonsovereign operations, ADB has funded financial institutions that have demonstrated the \ncommitment and ability to serve the needs of the financially excluded, as well as other segments. \nIn 2013, ADB provided a $15 million senior loan to Nations Trust Bank to support SME finance in \nSri Lanka.7 In 2015, ADB approved a project providing senior loans to two NBFIs for MSMEs in \nSri Lanka.8 Given the continued difficulty faced by MSMEs in accessing finance, DFCC has been \nidentified as a good partner to support continued financing of this critical sector. DFCC has been \nfunding MSMEs since it was established in 1955 with a mandate to spearhead development \nfinancing in a newly independent nation. It had a broad network of 102 branches and 36 service \noutlets located inside branches of Sri Lanka Post across the country as of 2017. Since 2016, \nDFCC has been actively targeting an emerging subsegment called small business enterprises \n(SBEs), which are formal microenterprises. SBE financing is considered part of the \u201cmissing \nmiddle,\u201d as the financial requirements of SBEs are more complex than loans provided by \nmicrofinance institutions and they are considered too risky or costly for commercial banks. DFCC \nhas good corporate governance, strong management, and satisfactory financial performance. \nThrough its nonsovereign operations, ADB has a relationship with DFCC and its former subsidiary \nDFCC Vardhana Bank (DVB). DVB joined ADB\u2019s Trade Finance Program in 2004, and ADB\u2019s \nBoard also approved a $15 million loan to DVB for housing finance in 2012.9  DFCC is also a \nparticipant in ADB\u2019s Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Line of Credit Project.10  \n \n \n                                                \n5  A.

The Government of Sri Lanka founded DFCC in 1955, with support from the \nWorld Bank; DFCC was listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange in 1956. Initially established as \nan LSB under Sri Lankan law, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) regulations required DFCC \nto focus on providing long-term finance with tenors of at least 5 years (referred to as development \nfinance, which also included project finance). In 2003, DFCC acquired over 94% of a local LCB, \nwhich was subsequently rebranded as DVB. DVB operated as an independent subsidiary of \nDFCC until it was absorbed by its parent on 1 October 2015. At the time of amalgamation, DVB \nrepresented just over half of the amalgamated entity\u2019s total assets. The amalgamated entity, \nDFCC, became an LCB. The integration of the two entities has since been completed, and DFCC \nshowed significant improvement in its performance in 2016. At the end of 2016, the total assets \nof the bank were SLRs291 billion, and it ranked sixth among all LCBs in Sri Lanka with a market \nshare of 3.7%. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n7.  Ownership. DFCC is publicly traded and is listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange. As of \n31 December 2017, the government indirectly controlled a 35.1% interest, held via Bank of \nCeylon\u2019s pension fund (14.4%), Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (10.0%), and the Employees\u2019 \nProvident Fund and the Employees\u2019 Trust Fund (combined 10.7%).11 Other shareholders include \nHatton National Bank (12.2%) and five funds of Aberdeen Asset Management PLC (United \nKingdom) (aggregate 9.5%). Muzaffar Ali Yaseen, a prominent businessman in the textile sector \nin Sri Lanka owns 9.9%. The other shareholders with over 5% stakes are Melstacorp (8.4%), \nRenuka Group (6.1%), and Seafeld International (5.8%). Melstacorp is ultimately controlled by \nHarry Jayawardena. ADB has conducted integrity due diligence.12 Further information is provided \nin the Integrity and Tax Due Diligence Disclosure.13 \n \n8.  Corporate  governance.  DFCC  is  a  board-driven  company  with  five  independent \ndirectors, one executive director, and two non-executive directors nominated by shareholders (as \nof 2017).14 C.R. Jansz, a non-executive director, has been the chairman since August 2014. \nJansz oversaw the merger between DFCC and DVB and has many years of experience in \nlogistics, insurance, banking, and finance relating to international trade. The board monitors and \napproves  DFCC\u2019s  major  financial  and  business  strategies  and  policies.  It  oversees  the \nmechanisms for financial control, internal control, and risk management, and it ensures that the \nprocesses are in place for strict compliance with applicable laws. The board has established \nmultiple committees, including an audit committee, credit approval committee, credit restructure \ncommittee,  human  resources  and  remuneration  committee,  nomination  and  governance \ncommittee, integrated risk management committee, and related party transactions committee. \n   \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \n                                                \n11  Ownership, Management, and Governance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n12  ADB. 2003.

In \nFebruary 2018, a director appointed by the government filled a vacant board position. \n ", "4 \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n9.  ADB will provide a senior loan of up to $50 million for up to 6 years to DFCC to improve \naccess to finance for MSMEs. At least 5% of the ADB loan will be used to support MSMEs owned \nor managed by women,15 and 20% of the proceeds of the ADB loan will be onlent to businesses \nlocated outside Colombo. \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n10.  Use of proceeds. DFCC will use the proceeds of ADB\u2019s debt financing to finance loans \nand leases to MSMEs in Sri Lanka. \n \n11.  Reporting arrangements. ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department will monitor the \nproject. DFCC will, at predetermined regular intervals and as requested, provide ADB with \nfinancial reports, including (i) quarterly unaudited financial statements; (ii) annual audited financial \nstatements; (iii) quarterly compliance certificates for financial covenants; (iv) annual reporting on \nthe MSME loan portfolios; and (v) annual reporting on environmental and social performance, \nincluding gender equality and selected development indicators agreed upon by ADB and the \nborrower. \n \n12.  Evaluation. DFCC will prepare monitoring reports and submit them to ADB regularly, and \nat least annually. The bank will submit the first report no later than 12 months after the first \ndisbursement. \n \nC.   Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n13.  Provide access to longer-tenor debt in support of micro, small and medium-sized \nenterprises. The ADB 6-year loan will provide critically needed longer-tenor funding to MSMEs \nin Sri Lanka, whose ability to access funds has been constrained by a variety of factors. Longer-\ntenor financing for financial institutions is needed given the country\u2019s low level of finance sector \ndevelopment\u2014including  the  absence  of  a  well-developed  capital  market\u2014which  limits  the \navailability of such funding. ADB\u2019s funding will also help support improved access to finance in \nrural areas, which had a poverty incidence of 82.2% in 2016, as compared with 8.0% in urban \nareas. While DFCC has been successful in gradually increasing its CASA deposits, it still relies \non wholesale borrowing to fund part of its lending operations. The ADB loan will be a long-term \nand stable funding source not readily available from other commercial banks. \n \n14.  Gender mainstreaming. Women lack access to finance in Sri Lanka. The International \nFinance Corporation estimated that women entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka face a credit gap of $350 \nmillion.16 ADB will help strengthen DFCC\u2019s outreach to women entrepreneurs and bolster internal \npolicies pertaining to women. The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming in \ndesign, as it aims to increase the number of SBE women borrowers by 3 times and SME women \n                                                \n15  At end 2017, 1.09% of the outstanding SME loans were to women; 0.68% of the SME loans disbursement in 2017 \nwere to women. \n16  Daily Mirror. 2018.

DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Output \n \n15.  Impacts. The impacts of the project will be (i) the development of mechanisms for easy \nand affordable access to finance by MSMEs; and (ii) the enhancement of access to finance, \nparticularly in the MSME sector. \n \n16.  Outcome. The project\u2019s outcome will be the sustainability of DFCC\u2019s increased lending \ncapacity to MSMEs. \n \n17.  Output. The output will be an increase in DFCC\u2019s lending capacity to MSMEs, including \nbusinesses owned or managed by women and those located outside Colombo. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n18.  Alignment with ADB strategy and country strategy. Under the Midterm Review of \nStrategy 2020, ADB aims to strengthen its support for the finance sector by (i) supporting the \ndevelopment of financial infrastructure, institutions, and products and services; and (ii) promoting \ninclusive growth.18 The proposed project supports the midterm review\u2019s strategic agenda of \npromoting  inclusive  economic  growth  by  facilitating  more  inclusive  access  to  economic \nopportunities, including jobs offered by MSMEs. It contributes to private sector development, a \nkey driver of change under the midterm review. The proposed project supports the government\u2019s \npriority of enhancing access to finance, particularly in the SME sector, as identified in Vision 2025, \nthe government\u2019s 8-year development plan.19 It is also aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy for Sri Lanka, 2018\u20132022 and is consistent with the government\u2019s policy framework for \neconomic development,20 which identifies MSMEs as a strategic sector and calls for support for \nprivate sector development projects that accelerate the pace of private sector participation and \npromote financial sector development.21  \n \n19.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The proposed project \nsupports institutional and finance sector development by deepening the finance sector and \nproviding funds for MSMEs onlending in urban and rural areas. It is aligned with ADB\u2019s Financial \nSector Operational Plan, indicating that ADB will support access to finance by MSMEs.22 The \nproject is also aligned with ADB\u2019s Gender Equality and Women\u2019s Empowerment and Operational \n                                                \n17  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18  ADB. 2012.

The \nproposed project will further build upon ADB\u2019s work and support finance sector development in \nSri Lanka. \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n20.  The project is classified category FI for impacts on the environment, and FI (treated as C) \nfor  impacts  on  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  ADB  has  assessed  the \ninvestment\u2019s potential environmental and social impacts, and its risks associated with DFCC\u2019s \nexisting and/or likely future portfolio and commitment and capacity for environmental and social \nmanagement. DFCC\u2019s transactions under the loan will have no, or minimal to limited, adverse \nenvironmental  impacts  and  are  unlikely  to  entail  impacts  on  involuntary  resettlement  and \nindigenous peoples. The proposed project will not finance any subprojects that are classified \ncategory A for environment or category A or B for involuntary resettlement and indigenous \npeoples. DFCC has established an environmental and social management system that generally \ncomplies with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) requirements. Enhancements to the \nenvironmental and social management system will be made prior to the first disbursement to \nensure investments using ADB funds are not on ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list, do not \nhave significant adverse environment and social safeguards impacts, abide by applicable national \nlaws and regulations, and comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement.25 DFCC will, in its \nannual report, monitor and provide information on its compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement and with relevant national laws, standards, and guidelines. \n \n21.  DFCC will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection \nStrategy, will take measures to comply with internationally recognized core labor standards.26 \nDFCC will report regularly to ADB on (i) its compliance with such laws and (ii) the measures taken. \nDFCC will conduct information disclosure in accordance with ADB requirements. Proactive \ngender features are included in the project design to support the project\u2019s effective gender \nmainstreaming category. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n22.  DFCC was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice related to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. DFCC\u2019s know-your-\ncustomer and anti-money laundering policy mitigates the risks of money laundering and terrorist \nfinancing. ADB will ensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate provisions \n                                                \n23  ADB. 2013.
