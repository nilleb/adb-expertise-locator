INTRODUCTION \n1.  This technical assistance (TA) is the outcome of wide-ranging stakeholder consultation \nprocess1 that led to the development of the Government of Bangladesh\u2019s Strategic Program for \nClimate Resilience (SPCR)2 under the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR). The PPCR is \npart of the Strategic Climate Fund3 within the Climate Investment Funds,4 and seeks to pilot and \ndemonstrate ways to mainstream climate resilience in development planning and management. \nBangladesh was the first country to have its SPCR approved by the PPCR subcommittee on 10 \nNovember 2010. The Bangladesh SPCR includes three investment projects and two TA projects to \n(i) improve coastal embankments, rural connectivity, and water supply and sanitation, and promote \npublic\u2013private  financing;  and  (ii)  institutionalize  climate  change  adaptation  information  and \nknowledge management (IKM) and raise government capacity (these are the aim of this TA). A TA \nfact-finding mission was fielded during 28 March\u20137 April 2011, during which the nature and scope \nof the TA were presented to the stakeholders and development partners, and the government \nconcurred with the TA impact, outcome, outputs, cost, implementation and financing arrangements, \nand terms of reference. The PPCR subcommittee approved the TA grant on 2 June 2011. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.5 \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Climate  change  is  a  pressing  development  concern  for  Bangladesh,  which  is  highly \nvulnerable to the impacts of climate change as a result of its geographic location, low deltaic \nfloodplain, and the hydro-meteorological influence of erratic monsoon rainfall and other extreme \nclimate events. Elements of climate change scenarios\u2014such as sea level rise, increased air and \nsea  surface  temperatures,  enhanced  monsoon  precipitation  and  runoff,  reduced  dry  season \nprecipitation, heat waves and increased intensity of tropical cyclones and storm surges, floods, and \nprolonged droughts\u2014have all been experienced in the recent past, and have significantly affected \nthe  country\u2019s  development  processes.  As  projected,  the  impacts  of climate  change  will  force \nmillions of people to migrate, squeeze settlements and resource-use patterns, and have serious \nimplications for the physical and natural environment. Given a business-as-usual scenario, climate \nchange will threaten the significant gains made in poverty reduction over the past two decades and \ndisproportionately impact the life and wellbeing of vulnerable groups\u2014including women, children, \nthe  elderly,  and  ethnic  minorities\u2014and  constrain  progress  toward  achieving  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. \n3.  Climate change information and knowledge management architecture. In Bangladesh \na significant amount of information has been generated and experience gained that are relevant to \nclimate  change  adaptation.  Coastal  communities  have  adopted  community-based  indigenous \ncoping techniques, such as raising the plinths of their homes, making structural adjustments and \ndeveloping  specific  forms  of  housing  for  long-term  adaptation,  and  developing  baira  (floating \ngardens) for growing vegetables. The dissemination of cyclone warnings using the community \nradio service and cellphone broadcasts has enhanced the ability of vulnerable communities to \n                                                \n1 The process included a multi-stakeholder consultation workshop; participants included representatives from ministries, \nline agencies, nongovernment organizations, civil society organizations, community-based organizations, research and \nacademic institutes, the private sector, and development partners. \n2 Government of Bangladesh. 2010. Bangladesh: Strategic Program for Climate Resilience. \nhttp://www.climateinvestmentfunds.org/cif/sites/climateinvestmentfunds.org/files/PPCR%205%20SPCR%20Banglades\nh%20nov2010.pdf \n3 The Strategic Climate Fund provides targeted programs with dedicated funding to pilot new approaches that have the \npotential to be scaled up. It includes the PPCR, the Forest Investment Program, and the Scaling Up Renewable Energy \nProgram in Low-Income Countries. \n4 The Climate Investment Funds are a unique pair of financing instruments designed to support low-carbon and climate-\nresilient development through scaled-up financing channeled through ADB, the African Development Bank, the \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Inter-American Development Bank, and the World Bank \nGroup. \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 6 May 2011.  \n ", "2   \nsurvive a cyclone strike. Indigenous knowledge of how to survive a cyclone\u2014though actions taken \nbefore, during, and after the cyclone\u2014has enhanced the resilience of communities. \n4.  While  generating  information  is  an  important  element  of  knowledge  management,  the \ninformation will not have an impact unless it is processed, analyzed, and disseminated to those in \nneed in a format that is easily understood. Moreover, climate change science is continuously being \nupdated,  and  new  information  and  knowledge  products  in  the  form  of  coping  strategies, \ntechnologies, and monitoring mechanisms are continuously being developed at national, regional, \nand  global  levels.  These  knowledge  products  do  not  necessarily  find  their  way  to  potential \nbeneficiaries, especially those at the forefront of climate change impacts\u2014farmers, fisherfolk, and \ncoastal communities. The 2010 assessment for the Asia Regional Center of Excellence on Climate \nChange and Development (funded by the United States Agency for International Development) has \nidentified several technical gaps that affect the region\u2019s ability to effectively address climate change. \nThese  include  (i)  disconnect  between  climate  science  and  policy  applications;  (ii)  data  and \nmodeling needed to answer fundamental questions, and specific tools needed to make more \ninformed decisions when developing climate action plans; and (iii) knowledge management. The \nlatter is constrained by the absence of an appropriate institutional architecture. These constraints \nmust be addressed as part of a climate change adaptation IKM network that encompasses the \ndevelopment and dissemination of easily understandable and implementable knowledge products \nfor the intended beneficiaries within an enabling policy environment and using an appropriate \ninstitutional architecture. \n5.  Inadequate  institutional  capacity.  The  effectiveness  of  institutions  and  agencies  in \naddressing the impacts of climate change across sectors, communities, and vulnerable groups \n(and especially women) is constrained by inadequate awareness; this is further exacerbated by \ninformation  gaps,  and  limited  capacity  for  information  generation,  analysis,  and  knowledge \nmanagement. These are manifested in the absence of processes and procedures needed for \ncapturing  and  sharing  information  and  knowledge  that  meets  the  needs  and  priorities  of \nstakeholders. Strengthening of key institutions through an appropriate capacity-building program \nand  establishment  of  appropriate  mechanisms  for  an  IKM  network  are  necessary  to  ensure \neffective delivery of climate change adaptation and related guidance and services. The climate \nchange adaptation IKM network would provide needed IKM products, which would in turn enhance \nthe government\u2019s position with respect to global climate change adaptation funding requirements, \nand effective participation in climate change negotiations and diplomacy at global forums. \n6.  Climate  change  adaptation  strategies  and  development  planning.  The  National \nAdaptation Program of Action and the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan \nprovide  an  adequate  basis  for  establishing  cross-sector  linkages  and  prompting  inter-sector \nplanning, thus facilitating climate change mainstreaming in development planning. Integration of \nclimate change funding in development planning reinforces mainstream thinking in climate change \nadaptation.  For  meaningful  transformational  change  to  occur,  IKM-specific  capacity-building \nprograms are needed that (i) recognize the need for enhanced awareness of climate change; (ii) \nprovide the requisite tools, guidance and knowledge products; and (iii) influence changes in the \nmindset of decision makers with regard to mainstreaming climate change in policies and practices. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The TA impact will be climate change adaptation effectively mainstreamed in development \nplanning  and  management.  The  TA  outcome  will  be  climate  change  adaptation  IKM  system \ninstitutionalized and linked to development planning and management. \n \n ", "  3 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The  TA  will  support  generation,  dissemination,  and  application  of  information  and \nknowledge products as the means to influence policies and address the potentially disastrous \nimpacts of climate change. The TA outputs include (i) a well-defined and operational climate change \nadaptation  IKM  network,  (ii)  enhanced  institutional  capacity  with  respect  to  climate  change \nadaptation IKM, and (iii) quality climate change adaptation information and knowledge products \ngenerated and disseminated. Consequently, the TA will contribute to development effectiveness on \nclimate change adaptation in Bangladesh. \n9.  Climate  change  adaptation  information  and  knowledge  management  network  and \ninstitutional architecture. The TA will establish an IKM network to collect, generate, and analyze \nclimate  change  adaptation-relevant  products,  and  disseminate  these  to  potential  beneficiaries, \nespecially women and other vulnerable groups. First, the TA will review and analyze the Bangladesh \nSPCR, the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan, the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) reports for the TA for Supporting Implementation of Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy \nand Action Plan,6 and available information on institutional responses to climate change adaptation, \nincluding coordination mechanisms and decision-making protocols, to determine how appropriate \nthese are to deal with current and future challenges. The analysis will also include (i) the current \nsystem  of  adaptation-specific  IKM,  (ii)  sources  and  availability  of  climate  change-adaptation \ninformation and its gender sensitivity, and (iii) information and knowledge gaps that constrain \nclimate-resilient  development  planning  and  compromise  appropriate  and  timely  delivery  of \nsolutions to address climate change impacts when they occur. Secondly, based on these analyses, \nan appropriate IKM network will be developed, with several nodes: a central node housed in the \nClimate Change Unit (CCU) of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF), satellite nodes in \nkey line ministries and agencies, and collaborative partnerships with national and regional climate \nchange adaptation institutions and networks. The institutional architecture will (i) clearly define the \nnetwork\u2019s functions, operational and administrative responsibilities, and protocols; (ii) clearly set \nforth the mission, organization, and implementation mechanisms to enable effective coordination, \nadministration, and management of the climate change adaptation program; and (iii) include cost \nestimates and a phased implementation plan. \n10.  Agreement by key stakeholders regarding the structuring of a climate change adaptation \nIKM network is needed, given its significance and the need for long-term sustainability. Several \nwide-ranging consultations (expert consultations, group discussions, workshops, and meetings) will \nbe undertaken on the proposed IKM network and its overall institutional architecture with key \nstakeholders,  including  selected  nongovernment  organizations  and  community-based \norganizations, research and academic institutes, and private sector and development partners. \nBased on this input, the IKM network, its institutional architecture, and the phased implementation \nplan will be refined and presented to the government for consideration, endorsement, and adoption. \n11.  Capacity building. A capacity-building and knowledge-management program (CBKMP) will \nbe developed and implemented to enhance the capacity of the IKM network-related institutions, \ntaking into account other climate change capacity-building programs and projects.7 The CBKMP \nwill also enhance the capacity of relevant government institutions to engage in international climate \nchange negotiations. \n12.  Once the overall institutional architecture is endorsed, the central node of the IKM network \nwill be established at the CCU, and the first satellite node established at the Local Government \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2009.

The unit is fairly well \nestablished with equipment, facilities, and professional staff and supports a databank with a wealth \nof information, some of which would be relevant to climate change adaptation. The unit will be \nfurther strengthened to become an effective climate change  adaptation-IKM satellite, with the \ncapacity to assist in the design of climate-resilient infrastructure. \n13.  Generation  and  dissemination  of  information  and  knowledge  products.  The  IKM \nnetwork will be the main online repository of information and knowledge products relevant to \nclimate  change  adaptation,  and  will  disseminate  this  information  and  knowledge\u2014including \ninformation on the differential impacts of climate change\u2014across genders, classes, ages, abilities, \nand  ethnic  groups.  Appropriate  linkages  will  be  established  with  the  multidonor  Asia  Pacific \nAdaptation Network9 and the ongoing TA for Regional Economics of Climate Change in South Asia \nPart II: Adaptation and Impact Assessment10 for information sharing and  modeling of  climate \nchange impacts. The IKM system will include communities as generators of knowledge, and promote \npeer-to-peer and lateral knowledge sharing. To promote both dissemination and interaction, mass \nmedia and social media will be used to facilitate broad knowledge sharing across significant \nportions of the communities that are (and will likely continue to be) affected by climate change. \n14.  Country-specific  analytical  studies  will  be  commissioned  on  priority  topics  to  address \ninformation  and  knowledge  gaps  and  identify  innovative  mechanisms  to  adapt  to  potentially \nadverse  climate  change  impacts  in  highly  vulnerable  sectors  and  locations,  and  on  highly \nvulnerable people (and especially women), using available and standard vulnerability assessments, \nmodeling, and projections. These may include (i) climate change adaptation and disaster risk-\nreduction strategies; (ii) the economic and financial implications of climate-resilient development; \n(iii) community-based adaptation measures, indigenous coping mechanisms, and implementation \nbottlenecks; (iv) information and communication systems; (v) market-based instruments to promote \nand enhance climate change adaptation; and (vi) other relevant topics. On the basis of these \nanalytical studies, appropriate climate change adaptation proposals will be drawn up and submitted \nfor financing under national, bilateral, and multilateral climate change funds. \n15.  Assumptions  and  risks.  Major  assumptions  are  (i)  the  government  sustains  its \ncommitment  to  mainstream  climate  change  in  development  planning;  (ii)  the  line  ministries, \nagencies,  and  institutions  are  willing  to  forge  and  maintain  multisector  and  inter-agency \ncollaborative partnerships; and (iii) there is an enabling policy for effective TA implementation. \nRisks include (i) the slow pace of necessary institutional, legal, and regulatory adjustments and \nprogramming to mainstream climate change; (ii) delays in assignment of qualified personnel to \nmanage  the  IKM  network;  and  (iii)  frequent  transfers  of  government  personnel  and  loss  of \ninstitutional memory. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $600,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed by a \n$500,000 grant from the Strategic Climate Fund.11 The government will provide in-kind support in \nthe form of office accommodation, administrative support including secretarial services to the \n                                                \n8  LGED is the executing agency for PPCR-funded investment projects administered by ADB. Similar satellite nodes will \nbe established in Bangladesh Water Development Board by the World Bank and the Ministry of Agriculture by the \nInternational  Finance  Corporation,  as  these  are  the  executing  agencies  for  their  administered  PPCR-funded \ninvestment projects respectively. \n9  The Asia Pacific Adaptation Network is a regional knowledge-sharing and capacity-building mechanism facilitated by \nADB, the United Nations Environment Programme, and others, and provides a web-portal for knowledge management \n(http://www.asiapacificadapt.net/). \n10 ADB. 2009.

The cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 18 months (January 2012\u2013June 2013). MOEF \nwill be the executing agency and appoint a project director not below the rank of deputy secretary \nto coordinate the TA activities. MOEF will assign two fulltime counterpart staff, working under the \ndirector of the CCU (one each for adaptation and knowledge management) to work with the \nconsultant team, help establish and maintain the IKM network, and ensure its continuity beyond the \nimplementation period. MOEF will also constitute a TA steering committee to guide and oversee \nimplementation.12 ADB  will  supervise  and  undertake  reviews  to  monitor  progress  and  ensure \neffective implementation. \n18.  The TA inception report, first quarterly progress report, midterm report, and final report will \nbe presented to the steering committee. To ensure outputs are of high quality, ADB and MOEF will \nset up a technical working group that includes at least three experts (in climate change adaptation; \neconomics and finance; and policy, legal, and institutional analysis). The experts will be selected \nfrom a panel of experts to be developed during implementation, and will follow clear terms of \nreference in reviewing the proposed IKM institutional architecture and the associated CBKMP and \nselected analytical studies. All reports, including proceedings of workshops, will be posted on the \nIKM network. \n19.   The  TA  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). ADB will be responsible for the \nprocurement of all goods and related services in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2010, as amended from time to time).13 The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time) and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging international and national consultants. A team of \nconsultants comprising one international (team leader for 10 person-months) and three national \nexperts  (12  person-months  each)  will  be  engaged  through  a  firm  using  simplified  technical \nproposals  and  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  with  quality-cost  ratio  of  90:10;14 terms  of \nreference are in Appendix 3. Commissioned studies and surveys will be outsourced to qualified \nindividuals or organizations in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved  ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to the Government of \nBangladesh to be financed on a grant basis by the Strategic Climate Fund for Climate Change \nCapacity Building and Knowledge Management, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n12 The steering committee will be chaired by the secretary of MOEF with representation from the Planning Commission, \nthe Finance Division, the Economic Relation Division, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Food and Disaster \nManagement, the Ministry of Local Government, the Rural Development and Cooperatives, the Ministry of Water \nResources,  the  Bangladesh  Water  Development  Board,  the  Department  of  Environment,  LGED,  the  Forest \nDepartment, and the Bangladesh Agriculture Research Institute. MOEF will provide secretarial support to the steering \ncommittee and coordinate with ministries and agencies concerned. \n13 The procured equipment and furniture will remain in the government agencies after completion of the technical \nassistance. \n14 A higher weight for the quality of the technical proposal is warranted because of the complex and highly technical \nnature of the consulting services. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nSummary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms   Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nClimate change  Climate change included as a key pillar  Bangladesh Seventh Five Year  The government \nadaptation effectively  in the government\u2019s 2016-2020 5-year  Plan: 2016-2020 (Planning  sustains its commitment \nmainstreamed in  development plan   Commission)  to mainstream climate \ndevelopment planning      change in development \nand management  Increased national and global financing  Government annual budgeting  planning. \nin support of climate change adaptation  documents (MOF) \n(proportional to BCCSAP estimates)  \nOutcome      Assumption \nClimate change  Climate change knowledge  Government annual planning  The line ministries, \nadaptation IKM  management protocols and monitoring  and budgeting documents  agencies, and \nsystem  mechanisms, including gender and  (Planning Commission, MOF,  institutions are willing to \ninstitutionalized and  socially sensitive indicators on  line ministries)   forge and maintain \nlinked to development  adaptation, adopted and applied by     multisector and inter-\nplanning and  MOEF on coordinating climate change  agency collaborative \nmanagement  budgeting and planning with line  partnerships. \nministries, MOF, and Planning \nRisk \nCommission (by June 2013) \nThe slow pace of \n \nnecessary institutional, \nlegal, and regulatory \nadjustments and \nprogramming to \nmainstream climate \nchange \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
