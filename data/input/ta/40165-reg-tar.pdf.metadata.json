INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Outlook (ADO) has been a flagship publication of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) since 1989. By regularly monitoring and providing comprehensive \nanalysis on the evolving developments in ADB's developing member countries (DMCs), the \npublication has become one of ADB\u2019s main vehicles for enhancing its reputation as a credible \nand authoritative source of knowledge about the region. The ADO also contributes to the \nintellectual  environment  in  which  policy  formulation  occurs.  Its  content  informs  ADB \nManagement opinion and guides institutional views about prospective developments and other \nimportant  issues.  The  production  of  the  ADO  has  been  regularly  supported  by  technical \nassistance (TA) funding. The objectives, scope, and activities to be covered by the regional TA1 \nare in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Efforts to improve the quality of the ADO have intensified in recent years in response to \nclients\u2019 feedback and the rapidly changing marketplace for economic information and analysis. \nThese  efforts  have  focused  on  providing  stronger  analytical  content  and  ensuring  better \ncohesion and balance among its parts. If the ADO is to remain competitive and relevant as an \nindependent and credible source of knowledge and information about the region, continuous \nwork must be done to further improve the quality of its analysis. Activities will include the \ncommissioning of relevant applied and policy research at a country and regional level, the \ndevelopment of new sources of information, and strengthened peer review. High-quality editing \nservices are crucial to ensure that the ADO\u2019s key messages are communicated clearly and \neffectively.  To  increase  the  ADO\u2019s  regional  and  international  reach,  the  Economics  and \nResearch  Department  (ERD)  will  continue  to  collaborate  with  the  Department  of  External \nRelations (DER) on further promoting the ADO. \n \n3.  The ADO is one of the most frequently downloaded publications from ADB\u2019s website.2 It \nis directly or indirectly the source of much international and national news commentary that \nfeatures analysis, views, and opinions from ADB. Thus, a concerted effort, not just to come up \nwith a high-quality publication, but also to disseminate ADO content, is essential to elevate the \npublication\u2019s profile.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n4.  The TA will support activities that will contribute to high-quality and comprehensive \neconomic analysis of the region and help ensure the usefulness and relevance of the ADO to \npolicy dialogue and formulation in DMCs. The improved content and structure of ADO 2010 and \nits update is expected to provide in-depth, relevant, and timely assessment of the region\u2019s \neconomy. Appendix 2 contains the draft contents pages of ADO 2010 and ADO 2010 Update. \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 26 February 2009. \n2  In the last 3 years, the ADO and its Update have consistently ranked among the top ADB downloads from the \nmonth of launch until the following year. For instance, ADO 2007 topped the chart at number one during its March \n2007 launch and remained in the top 5 for the remainder of the year; in 2008, it ranked between 5th and 22nd until \nthat year\u2019s ADO was launched. On average, the whole publication has been downloaded around 200,000 times per \nyear in the last three years. At the time of their launches, the ADO and its update have continued to generate \nsignificant coverage from both global and regional top-tier media, such as the Financial Times, Asian Wall Street \nJournal, and International Herald Tribune. \n ", "2   \nAs in the previous issues, the publication will be presenting original work on current and relevant \nthemes of interest within developing Asia and the Pacific. \n \n5.  The TA will further develop and refine analytical methods to support ADB\u2019s short- and \nmedium-term country economic monitoring and reporting. The methods will also strengthen the \neconomic underpinnings of country programs and strategies for the DMCs covered. \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n6.  The main outputs from the TA will be ADO 2010 and ADO 2010 Update. The TA will \nsupport  the  following  key  activities:  preparation  of  background  analytical  papers,  further \ndevelopment and refinement of analytical methods, drafting of ADO content, economic and copy \nediting, and preparation and layout of materials for publication. The objective of the papers will \nbe to provide a solid empirical and analytical foundation for ADO content. The papers will \nsupplement  the  research  work  of  ADB\u2019s  Macroeconomics  and  Finance  Research  Division \n(ERMF) on the selected topics, and will contain analysis of issues and policy implications for the \nDMCs covered using a review of existing literature, analyses of survey and macroeconomic \ndata, and modeling under different scenarios. Activities for the preparation of ADO 2011 will \nalso be supported under the TA.  \n  \n7.  To ensure accuracy, coherence, and consistency in approach across the different parts \nof the ADO, high-quality editing services are required. Economic and copy editing activities will \nbe  provided  by  international consultants  working  under  the  direction  of  the  assistant chief \neconomist, ERMF.  \n \n8.  Workshops and training directly relevant to the preparation and strengthening of ADO \ncontent will also be supported by the TA. The focus will be on macroeconomic analysis, growth \naccounting, economic projections, and effective writing skills, which will target economists in \nregional departments, national officers in resident missions, and, as appropriate, government \nofficials and other client groups. The objective of the training is to equip writers with the skills \nand the tools needed to craft high-quality country chapters. The training will also impart skills \nthat are of broader relevance for economic and sector work, which underpins country strategies.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n9.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 (Appendix 3). The TA will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2014other sources). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n10.  ADB will be the executing agency responsible for implementing and monitoring the TA. \nIn particular, ERMF will implement the TA in close coordination with regional departments and \nresident missions. The assistant chief economist of ERMF, reporting to the chief economist of \nERD, will be responsible for implementation. Given the high institutional profile of the ADO, ERD \nwill report to the vice-president for Knowledge Management and Sustainable Development, the \nmanaging director general, and the President at critical points in its preparation. \n \n11.  The development of analytical tools and approaches to support high-quality ADO content \nwill be a joint effort of ERMF economists, country economists of the regional departments and \nresident missions, national experts, international consultants, and economics editors. The TA \nwill finance the procurement of information and knowledge services as may be required to \n ", "  3\n \n12.  ADO  workshops  are  tentatively  scheduled  for  January\u2013February  2011  at  ADB \nheadquarters. The workshops will present and discuss issues and directions on several topics \nfor consideration and inclusion in the subsequent year\u2019s ADO. The TA will cover the travel \nexpenses of selected resident mission staff who will be participating in the workshops. Contents \nof country chapters and other issues will also be discussed during the workshops. \n \n13.  An estimated 15 person-months (about six consultants) of international consultants\u2019 time \nwill be required for economic and technical editing of ADO manuscripts before final publication \nof ADO 2010 and ADO 2010 Update. ADO will also require 3 person-months (about three \nconsultants) of international consultancy resources for preparing background papers. Another 5 \nperson-months (about two consultants) of national economic consultants\u2019 time will be required \nto assist in preparing country chapters and data sheets. The outline terms of reference for the \nconsultants  and  resource  persons  are  in  Appendix  4.  The  consultants  will  be  hired  as \nindividuals.3 Resource persons will also be engaged to conduct training workshops and prepare \nbackground papers on economic trends and prospects of selected DMCs. Consultants and \nresource  persons  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will be made in \naccordance with the ADB Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.4 \n \n14.  The major results of ADO 2010 and ADO 2010 Update will be disseminated to the media, \nDMC policy makers, and civil society. The media launch and subsequent roadshows will be \nundertaken by ERMF in coordination with DER, while separate launches will be undertaken by \nresident  missions  in  selected  DMCs.  Roundtable  discussions  and  workshops  in  different \nacademic and economic institutions will also be conducted to reach a wider audience. Both \nADO 2010 and ADO 2010 Update will be featured on the ADB website, and printed copies will \nbe distributed worldwide. In countries where there is limited broadband access, CD-ROMs will \nbe made available through the resident missions. The TA may support translation of ADO into \nother languages, as may be required, to extend its audience in selected DMCs. This will be \narranged by regional departments in consultation with the resident missions concerned and \nDER. ERMF will work with DER to attempt to capture broad and valuable client feedback.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis for \nthe Asian Development Outlook 2010, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n3 The TA will involve independent studies and require rapid mobilization of the editorial consultants to ensure that \nthere  are  no  delays  in  the  tight  production  schedule  of  the  publications.  In  addition,  the  experience  and \nqualifications of the individual consultants will be a primary consideration. Thus, the consultants will be hired on an \nindividual basis. \n4 ADB. 2008.
