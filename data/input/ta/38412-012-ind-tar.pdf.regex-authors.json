INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) country strategy and program update (CSPU) for \nIndia1 included a project to operationalize cost-effective and sustainable flood and river erosion \nmanagement  for  Assam.  Following  consultations  in  May  2004  and  June  2005,  and  the \nsubsequent request by the Government of India, the Fact-Finding Mission was undertaken during \n16 February\u20137 March 2006 to formulate the project preparatory technical assistance (TA) for the \nNorth  Eastern  Integrated  Flood  and  Riverbank  Erosion  Management  Project  (Assam).2 The \nMission discussed with representatives of the Government, Assam state government (ASG), and \nstakeholders to reach an understanding on the objectives, scope, costs, and implementation \narrangements for the TA. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Floods  and  Riverbank  Erosion  in  India.  India  is  one  of  the  most  disaster-prone \ncountries in the world. Floods and river erosion are major recurrent natural disasters, affecting on \naverage 7.6 million hectares (ha) and causing damage of an estimated $400 million annually \nbetween 1953 and 2003. The country has a flood-prone area of 46 million ha, which includes a \nquarter of its cultivable land. Vulnerability is high in the Ganges\u2013Brahmaputra\u2013Meghna river \nbasins in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, and other northeastern states, which have \nthe lowest per capita incomes in India. The National Common Minimum Programme of 2004 has \naccorded priority to protection and development of these vulnerable low-income areas. \n3.  A comprehensive policy framework for flood control that has been in place since 1954 has \npromoted short- to long-term programs for both structural and nonstructural measures. Over the \nyears, increasing emphasis has been placed on flood management recognizing that absolute \nphysical control of floods and riverbank erosion is not feasible. The revised National Water Policy \nof 2002 further emphasized nonstructural measures, and incorporated an integrated approach \nwith basinwide watershed management and stakeholder participation. Within this framework, 16 \nmillion ha of riverine land has been protected with flood embankments and other structures. A \nnationwide flood forecasting and warning system has also been set up.  \n4.  Assam State. Despite an abundance of natural resources, poverty remains widespread in \nAssam. In 2000, 36% of its 26 million people were living below the poverty line. While the growth \nof Assam\u2019s gross state domestic product accelerated to over 5% in recent years, it still falls well \nbelow national gross domestic product level. Many other development indicators also continue to \nlag far behind national averages due to several factors, including poor infrastructure, remoteness, \nand inability to minimize the impacts of damage from frequent floods. The state\u2019s strategy for \neconomic growth emphasizes rural development through strategic interventions, and rapid urban \nand  industrial  growth  with  private  sector  partnership  in  key  infrastructure,  including  power, \ncommunication,  and  transport.  Given  that  over  80%  of  Assam\u2019s  poor  live  in  rural  areas, \nenhancing agricultural and rural development will be key to reducing poverty and accelerating \nsocial development. \n5.  Assam  is  mostly  covered  by  the  alluvial  plains  and  adjacent  low-lying  hills  of  the \nBrahmaputra and the Barak river basins.3 The basins\u2019 most significant problems, and causes of \nsignificant  flooding  and  river  erosion,  are  the  runoff  from  extremely  heavy  rainfall  and  high \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004. India: Country Strategy and Update (2005\u20132007). Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 13 March 2006.  \n3  The Brahmaputra River is 2,880 kilometers (km) long and drains an area of 580,000 km2, of which 51%, 8%, 34%, \nand 8%, respectively, are in the People\u2019s Republic of China, Bhutan, India, and Bangladesh. About 640 km with \n70,600 km2 of drainage area is in Assam.  \n ", "2   \nsediment  loads  from  upper  watersheds,  which  are  geologically  young  and  unstable  and \nsusceptible to earthquakes and landslides. Watershed degradation due to deforestation and \nshifting cultivation is also widespread, particularly in India. Total runoff from the Brahmaputra river \nbasin is among the highest in the world, while its annual sediment transport of 500 million tons is \nsecond only to that of the Yellow River in the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n6.  Floods. Flooding is a perennial problem in Assam, causing significant economic damage \neach year. The state\u2019s flood-prone area amounts to 3.1 million ha, or some 40% of the total \ngeographical area. This includes over 90% of the agricultural land and urban population centers, \nas well as its most valuable economic assets such as tea estates, oil fields, roads, and airports. \nThus, effective flood management is crucial to the state\u2019s economic performance. On average, an \nestimated  $47  million  in  annual  crop  production  is  lost  due  to  floods,  while  damage  to \nhomesteads and livelihood affects some 3 million people. In 2004, a devastating flood affected \n12.3 million people and 2.9 million ha, with damage amounting to $1.5 billion.  \n7.  ASG has implemented a number of flood control schemes since the 1950s, covering 1.6 \nmillion ha of flood-prone areas with embankments and involving a flood forecasting and warning \nsystem  linked  to  the  central  system.4 However,  most  schemes  have  deteriorated  due  to \ninsufficient maintenance. After the 2004 flood, ASG is according high priority to rehabilitating and \nupgrading existing embankments that protect critical urban and rural centers with high growth \npotential.  This  should  be  accompanied  by  measures  to  ensure  secure  protection  (such  as \neffective supervision and secondary defense line of dikes), with sound maintenance systems. For \nother areas where land is unprotected and poverty incidence is high, more adaptive coping \nmeasures  are  called  for.5 Overall,  active  stakeholder  participation  and  agency  coordination, \nincluding local governments, are required to attain the highest flood resistance, with integrated \nplanning that explores a range of flexible options, and coordinated program implementation.  \n8.  Riverbank Erosion. Riverbank erosion is also a chronic problem caused by dynamic \nshifting of channels flowing through unconsolidated heavy sand or silt strata of the floodplain, with \nhigh sediment discharge. Since 1954, Assam\u2019s 17 riverine districts have lost 7% of their land area \nto erosion. Some 8,000 ha of land (valued at $20 million) is lost annually, which is accompanied \nby the appearance of low-lying unproductive sandbars. The social impact is huge. About 10,000 \nfamilies  are  displaced  each  year  and  those  who  become  landless  are  forced  to  move  to \nincreasingly congested nearby riverbank lines and dikes. More critically, progressive river erosion \nis threatening many flood embankments with possible devastating inundation and associated \ndamage once it reaches and undercuts the embankments during the monsoon.6  \n9.  The Water Resources Department (WRD) of ASG has provided protection structures\u2014 \nmostly spurs and a small number of revetments\u2014to protect some 50 km of bank lines along vital \nstate interests, while adopting an approach of retiring (setting back) embankments for other \nprotected areas. However, experience indicates that protection structures require high capital \ncost (at $1 million per km), often induce erosion and land loss between spurs, and require regular \nmaintenance to withstand flow attacks. Embankment retirement is a cheaper option in the short \nrun, but it may lead to much higher land loss and social displacement over the long run. There is \na  critical  need  to  develop  more  cost-effective,  and  socially  and  environmentally  desirable \nmitigation measures, which are within the fiscal capacity of ASG and local institutions and can be \n                                                 \n4  The system covers other northeastern states and also receives hydrometeorological data from Bhutan and the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China. However, further extension and modernization are needed to improve its accuracy.  \n5  Such as (i) flood proofing, (ii) small-scale flood protection with dwarf dikes (using existing and planned roads) in \ninland riverine areas, (iii) improved flood warning systems, and (iv) promotion of alternative cropping practices.  \n6  At present, about 130 locations face immediate threats. Among them are vital urban and state interests such as oil \nfields, tea gardens, and the Kaziranga National Park, habitat of one of the world\u2019s last single-horn rhino populations.  \n ", "  3\nsustained in the highly dynamic morphological environment. There is a need for exploration and \ncareful assessment of innovative and lower-cost options that have been applied within or outside \nIndia, 7  and  systematic  development  through  field-testing  and  implementation.  Significant \nopportunities also exist to lower program costs by setting up proactive management systems \nbased on short-term erosion prediction using historic satellite images, and to plan and provide \ntimely preventive measures before major erosion and channel shifting take place.  \n10.  Policy, Planning, and Institutional Basis. While WRD does not have its own policy or \nstrategy  documents  to  guide  its  operations,  it  generally  follows  existing  Government  policy \nframeworks (para. 3) and the Brahmaputra Master Plan (BMP) in flood and riverbank erosion \nmanagement (FREM). The BMP for the Brahmaputra and Barak rivers was updated by the \nBrahmaputra Board in 1996 and provides (i) a broad planning framework for FREM through better \ndata  and  knowledge  management;  and  (ii)  short-  to  long-term  measures,  comprising  flood \nforecasting and warning, floodplain zoning, flood proofing, and watershed management.8  \n11.  Nevertheless, wide gaps exist between these national frameworks and ASG\u2019s sector \noperations. Specifically, their FREM tends to be focused on structural approaches, stand-alone, \nand top-down in its decision making. It is prudent to develop an effective strategy and action plan \nto make operations comprehensive, participatory, and sustainable.9 In this connection, lack of \nfunding for operation and maintenance (O&M) is a major issue. There is a need for developing a \ndedicated revenue source (such as a flood cess) and a mechanism to earmark the collected \nfunds for O&M, along the lines of similar reforms pursued in the road sector. Mechanisms for \neffective community participation in FREM need to be explored and established. Likewise, the \ninstitutional  setup,  resources,  and  functions  of  WRD  and  related  organizations  should  be \nexamined and strengthened. Key agendas include (i) a framework for agency coordination for \nmore integrated planning and programming for FREM and related interventions; (ii) work on the \nsocial and environmental concerns in FREM; (iii) sound database and decision support systems; \nand (iv) realignment of staff resources, skills mix, and management to address these issues.10   \n12.  The ASG submitted an investment proposal to ADB for improving key FREM infrastructure \nincluding embankments, riverbank protection and flood proofing works along the Brahmaputra \nand Barak rivers to protect vital state economic interests. Building on the proposal, an investment \npackage  needs  to  be  prepared  that  is  ready  for  prompt  implementation,  and  can  provide \neconomic returns commensurate with ADB\u2019s lending terms, while strengthening the policy and \ninstitutional framework for integrated FREM. The TA will support this process by addressing the \naforementioned issues, in line with the priorities of ADB\u2019s Water Policy and CSPU for India \n(2005\u20132007)  that  emphasizes  upgrading  infrastructure  and  facilitating  rural  development  for \nbroad-based economic growth and employment creation.  \n                                                 \n7  In recent years, pro-siltation measures, i.e., inducing silt deposit on the riverbed by placing tetrahedron-shaped \nconcrete frames (or \u201cporcupines\u201d), have been introduced with good results in Assam. There are also opportunities for \nexploring alternative lower-cost designs for revetments and other works developed and applied in other countries.  \n8  The report of the Government\u2019s 2004 Task Force for Flood Management and Erosion Control, formed in response to \nthe major floods in India\u2019s eastern states in 2004, also provides guidance. \n9  In this context, an opportunity exists to start preparing a state water policy and investment plan to promote \ncomprehensive FREM linked with watershed and environment conservation from an integrated perspective. \n10  Given WRD\u2019s limited experience in externally funded investment projects, timely implementation to meet the \nprocedural guidelines of the financiers also remains an issue despite the department\u2019s high technical capacities.  \n ", "4   \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The  TA  impact  is  increased  effectiveness  in  protecting,  sustaining,  and  enhancing \nincomes while reducing poverty along the Brahmaputra and Barak rivers. The TA outcome is the \ndesign of a sector-type project\u2014with the possible use of a multitranche financing facility (MFF) \nagreed upon by ASG, the Government, and ADB\u2014that will (i) reduce flood and riverbank erosion \ndamage in vital state interests, and (ii) strengthen the policy and institutional bases to support \ncomprehensive FREM. The ensuing project will tentatively comprise (i) participatory scheme \nplanning; (ii) a range of FREM infrastructure (including flood embankments, riverbank protection, \nand flood proofing), and nonstructural measures (covering flood and other natural disaster risk \nzoning, preparedness and management); (iii) complementary support to enhance growth and \npoverty impacts; and (iv) institutional support and project management. Priority will be accorded \nto upgrading existing FREM systems protecting critical urban and rural areas.11  \n14.  To meet the MFF criteria, the TA outputs will comprise (i) a requisite road map toward \noperationalizing the relevant policy principles\u2014including comprehensive FREM with integrated \nwater resources management (IWRM) perspectives and sustainable O&M\u2014along with a sound \ninvestment  program;  (ii)  fully  appraised  sample  subprojects  to  provide  FREM  and  other \ninterventions for inclusion in the first financing tranche, based on thorough analyses of innovative, \ncost-effective, and sustainable FREM options; (iii) a list of other subprojects assessed as meeting \nthe set selection criteria and safeguard frameworks; (iv) institutional arrangements for proactive, \ntimely,  and  effective  planning  and  delivery  of  FREM  programs  responding  to  dynamic  river \nprocesses; and (v) support programs to implement the above strategy and action plan.12  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The TA will (i) use WRD\u2019s existing technical capacities; (ii) explore alternative options for \nFREM  infrastructure  and  nonstructural  programs;  and  (iii)  assist  comprehensive  subproject \nplanning  and  related  institutional  studies,  incorporating  innovative  international  technology, \nlessons, and experience. A consultative approach will be taken through stakeholder workshops, \nincluding the media. Activities are in two phases. \n16.  Phase 1: Strategy and Option Studies (3.5 months). This phase will provide a strategic \nframework and options for integrated FREM at state and selected subproject levels. The TA will \n(i) prepare a FREM strategy and action agenda by analyzing basin conditions and state-level \npolicy, planning, and institutional bases and gaps, with an IWRM perspective; and (ii) identify and \nassess options for the most effective approach to FREM in the sample subproject areas, by \ncollecting necessary data and analyzing hydrology and morphology. Innovative and cost-effective \nmeasures and lessons from India and elsewhere will be explored to strengthen flood resistance \nwhile reducing the costs and negative impacts of erosion mitigation works.  \n17.  Phase 2: Subproject Proposals and Institutional Actions (6.5 months). This phase will \nformulate  an  MFF  project  through  feasibility  studies,  institutional  analyses,  and  investment \nprogramming and project packaging. Specific activities are (i) finalizing participatory options and \n                                                 \n11  The ensuing project may also cover other states in the northeastern region, for which a separate TA will be prepared \nsubject to official requests submitted through the Government.  \n12  Up to four subprojects will be fully appraised and the remaining subprojects meeting the set selection criteria will be \nidentified under the TA. The latter will be appraised prior to the launching of the concerned tranche. A process-type \napproach will be justified based on a conducive policy framework, institutional strengthening plan, clear investment \npackaging, and, in general, exclusion of subprojects having major safeguard implications.  \n ", "  5\ndetailed feasibility studies of sample subprojects; (ii) assessing safeguards and preparing the  \nrequisite  action  plans;  (iii)  formulating  a  social  development  strategy  and  action  programs, \nincluding  participatory  mechanisms  for  the  project;  (iv)  following  a  consultative  process  in \npreparing a sector road map, including actions for strengthening WRD, sustaining O&M, and \nfostering integrated FREM and IWRM; and (v) formulating an investment program and a project \npackage ready for implementation. The initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2.  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.1 million equivalent. The TA will be cofinanced \non a grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom for $800,000 equivalent and by the \nCooperation Fund for the Water Sector for $50,000 equivalent. Both grants will be administered \nby ADB. ASG will finance the remaining $250,000 equivalent. The Government of India and ASG \nwill also provide relevant information and analytical work. Details of the cost estimates and \nfinancing are in Appendix 3. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not \ncommit ADB to finance any ensuing project.  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n19.  WRD will be the Executing Agency (EA) of the TA, and will appoint a TA director at the \nlevel of chief engineer, under the guidance of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern \nRegion and in coordination with other concerned central agencies. WRD will form a TA steering \ncommittee  chaired  by  the  secretary  of  WRD,  with  the  participation  of  the  department  staff \nconcerned.13 WRD will also mobilize a project preparatory core group (PPCG), including WRD \nstaff (in planning, survey, quality control, and monitoring) and nominees from other departments \nrepresenting the TA steering committee.14 ADB will provide intensive review and supervision by \nfielding missions at critical stages of TA implementation.  \n20.  The TA will be implemented from February to December 2007. Consulting services will be \nprovided in three teams. The phase 1 team will comprise 2 person-months (p-m) of international \nexperts and 12 p-m of national experts. The phase 2 team will comprise 8.5 p-m of international \nexperts and 34 p-m of national experts. The third team will comprise a panel of experts (3 p-m \ninternational and 2 p-m national). Outline terms of reference for each team are in Appendix 4. The \nphase  1  international  consultant  will  be  engaged  as  an  individual  by  ADB,  while  national \nconsultants will be engaged through a local firm using quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) \nbased on biodata technical proposals. Advance action will be taken on a noncommittal basis. All \nphase 2 consultants will be engaged through an international firm in association with national \nconsultants following QCBS based on full technical proposals. The panel of experts will be \nengaged on an individual basis by ADB. All recruitment will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (April 2006, as amended from time to time) and other arrangements satisfactory to \nADB for selecting and engaging national consultants. The phase 1 team will prepare inception \nand final reports within 2 weeks and 4 months of fielding, respectively. The phase 2 team will \nprepare inception, draft final, and final reports within 2 weeks, 5 months, and 6 months of \nmobilization,  respectively.  Stakeholder  workshops  involving  ASG,  the  Government,  the \nconsultants, and ADB will be organized to discuss these reports.  \n                                                 \n13  Including planning and development, disaster management, finance, revenue, resettlement and rehabilitation, public \nworks, rural development, irrigation, forestry, soil conservation, agriculture, and fisheries. \n14 Representatives of Government institutions, including the Brahmaputra Board, Central Water Commission, and North \nEast Hydraulic and Allied Research Institute will also participate in the PPCG,  \n ", "6   \nIV.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?      No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in India. \nAccording to the National Human Development Report (2002), incidence of poverty based on the head count ratio declined \nfrom 44.5% in 1983 to 26.1% in 1999\u20132000 in India. Significant strides have been made to reduce poverty in rural and urban \nareas; however, chronic and absolute poverty and entrenched poverty pockets persist in many states, despite an ongoing \nfood surplus. This raises questions about intervention strategies, distribution of resources, inclusive development efforts, and \nparticipatory development to sustain development efforts. The report highlighted the marked differences in poverty incidence \nwithin the country. The northeastern region in particular lags far behind the national averages of most development \nindicators. The region is marked by low agricultural productivity, poor infrastructure, and low levels of industrial activity. In \naddition, ongoing ethnic tensions have constrained development in agricultural infrastructure and other private sector \nactivities. \n \nThe proportion of Assam\u2019s population living below the poverty line is quite high at about 36.1%. This is the highest among the \nseven northeastern states and substantially above the national average. Over two thirds of Assam\u2019s population is rural. \nPoverty is largely rural, with 40% of the rural population below the poverty line. Poverty is more widespread in Assam\u2019s \nwestern and southern districts and the hill districts.  \n \nThe Brahmaputra and Barak rivers and their tributaries dominate the economic and social life of Assam. Most of Assam\u2019s \npopulation live in either of the two river valleys, and over 90% of urban and agriculture land is located in the flood prone area. \nThus, the regular occurrence of floods, waterlogging after floods, and loss of land due to river erosion constrain the state \neconomic activities as a whole. Along with the service sector in urban and rural areas\u2015that is affected by lack of employment \nopportunities associated with low level of investments\u2015agriculture remains the primary economic sector, with paddy, wheat, \nmustard, potatoes, and other vegetables as the major crops. Its productivity is well below the national average, and only \nabout half of the state\u2019s farmers cultivate their fields more than once a year. The uncertainties and vagaries of rainfall and \nassociated floods hamper agricultural productivity.  \n \nIn view of the intrinsic linkage between flooding and river erosion and the state\u2019s economic performance, effectively \nmanaging annual flooding is critical to propel economic growth and make more rapid inroads into poverty reduction. The risk \nof flooding is cited as the main factor hampering urban and industrial development, as the risk of investment losses is \nconsidered very high in most areas. Given the concentration of the poor in the rural areas, enhancing agriculture and rural \ndevelopment also needs to be pursued within the context of the project. Increased rice production will require developing \nirrigated agriculture (only 20% of the state\u2019s cropland is irrigated), for which flood embankment and river erosion control will \nprovide a conducive environment. The unpredictable nature of the annual floods has also made farmers risk averse, planting \nonly one rainfed paddy crop annually. People have been made homeless and landless by progressive riverbank erosion, and \nhave been forced into sharecropping arrangements to survive, with little incentive to invest in productivity-enhancing agro-\ntechnology. Promoting irrigation in protected areas would allow for much greater crop production during the relatively safe dry \nseason.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                    Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nParticipatory poverty analysis is required to analyze specific groups of the rural poor and disadvantaged sections, such as \nlandless people, sharecropping tenants, scheduled tribes, and scheduled castes in the project areas. Specific strategies will \nhave to be developed to meet their needs and priorities for enhancing their livelihood as well as their ability to cope with the \nimpacts of floods and riverbank erosion. \nPeople in the project area are vulnerable in many respects, including to the high risk of seasonal flooding and the possibility \n(but inherently unpredictable risk) of catastrophic flooding that may wipe out their farms and homesteads. The technical \nassistance (TA) will provide a comprehensive picture of poverty as it exists in the subproject areas, focusing on selected \nflood protection and riverbank erosion mitigation schemes. The TA will assess the impacts of annual flooding and riverbank \nerosion on poverty and the livelihood options that could arise from better protection and management. The TA will also \nanalyze the concept of \u201cliving with the floods,\u201d its validity, and lessons learned from previous river embankment and erosion \nmitigation efforts. Options for enhancing nonstructural measures of flood management at the community level will also be \nexplored.  \n \nDeveloping the asset base of the poor for income-generating activities through diversification of cropping patterns, fisheries \netc., although outside the scope of the present Project, will be explored and recommendations for linkages to ongoing rural \ndevelopment projects provided. Farmers have adapted their land use and cropping pattern to flooding circumstances. \n ", "  Appendix 2  11 \nBesides paddy, fish is a major food source for the poor of Assam. However, river embankments might reduce floodplain \nfisheries production with consequent negative effects on the poor, whose access to this common property gives them a main \nsource of animal protein in their diet. \u201cControlled flooding\u201d in this context suggests the use of regulators in the embankments \nto allow for a two-way movement of fish species between the river and the floodplain. The TA will obtain more information on \nfloodplain fisheries in embankment areas and feasible ways to maintain floodplain fisheries alongside fishponds. The level of \npoverty, livelihood options, and nonstructural measures for community-oriented flood management will be reflected in the \nproject synthesis, with sample subproject proposals developed with the active participation of stakeholders during phase 2 of \nthe TA. \n \nTo improve the impact on poverty reduction, poverty impact analysis will assess if flood protection and riverbank erosion \nmitigation will improve stakeholders\u2019 confidence in undertaking investments to enhance their livelihood and thus contribute to \nthe overall economic growth of the effectively protected area. During the feasibility studies, distribution analysis will assess \nthe equity of project impacts and determine how the costs and benefits of the project are shared among the poor and other \nstakeholders. It will identify the (i) costs to be incurred and benefits realized, (ii) impacts of the gains distributed to \nbeneficiaries, (iii) beneficiaries\u2019 capacity and willingness to pay the costs ,and (iv) impact of overall project performance and \nreturns on equity considerations. The analysis will also suggest project design options and activities to enhance the impact \non the targeted beneficiaries, which will culminate into action plans for poverty reduction. This will also provide a baseline \ndatabase to be used for quantitative monitoring of the poverty reduction impacts of the project.   \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nCommunity participation in flood management is a new approach in coping with floods better and in a timely manner. \nPrevious approaches are characterized by total dependence on government, which has its own limitations in response, \ninaccessibility, and outreach at the household level. Nongovernment organizations may not have a presence in many areas \nas well. Therefore, direct involvement of people in flood management is expected to be more effective and useful. This \nconcept was introduced in India when Panchayats or community-based organizations elected by the people became \nfunctional at district, block, and village levels, as part of the Assam Panchayat Raj Act 1992. \n \nThe establishment of a community-oriented institutional framework for implementing flood management (both structural and \nnonstructural) will be examined during the TA and an effective and practical participation strategy developed. The framework \nneeds to consider the interests of diverse population including mobile migrants of char land  and riverine  areas as \nappropriate. The constitution of flood management committees, complementary to already existing community structures, will \nalso be explored. Possible linkages and cooperation with the existing systems, including self-help groups and development \ncommittees will be analyzed to see whether self-help groups can take on the task of flood management. If the Panchajat Raj \nsystem can take on the recommended flood management committee (it has committees for agriculture, health, education, \netc.), the state may explore the possibility of according legal status to the flood management committees through appropriate \nlegislative measures. \n \nThe TA will seek ways to turn people\u2019s interest in and need for embankments (i.e., to build houses on high land) into an \nadvantage and obtain their assistance in providing regular operation and maintenance of embankments and other structures. \nThe Assam state government operates various poverty, rural development, and relief schemes, including programs for the \nadvancement of tribal people. The TA will explore ways to tap into such programs as the Employment Guarantee Scheme, \nwhich could be expanded in the near future, and provide employment vouchers to qualified people currently living on the \nembankments. The scheme could also be a focal point in restoring the livelihood of resettled people. \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nA strategy to maximize the impact of structural and nonstructural measures for flood control and erosion mitigation will be \nprepared  by  the  TA  through  gender  assessments.  Both  women  and  men  will  equally  benefit  from  a  more  secure \nenvironment, particularly river erosion mitigation. Women play a significant role in society and are active in matters of social \nconcern, such as farming and selling of surplus produce in local markets. Apart from specifically targeting women as \nbeneficiaries, women\u2019s participation will be ensured throughout the project cycle, and women will be provided with equal \nopportunities through gender mainstreaming in project implementation and administration positions. In particular, as women \nare paid less than men for equal work, the TA will also examine ways to include women (if interested) on an equal basis in \nthe labor opportunities arising from the project. \n \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes     No \n \n ", "12  Appendix 2 \nE.

At this \nstage, the magnitude of the impacts cannot be \ndetermined, but could be significant, in particular for \nsubprojects to protect urban, peri-urban, and populated \nrural areas.

Since the subprojects are \nstill to be identified, the Project is provisionally classified \nas category B, which will be refined following more \ndetailed investigations during the TA. The TA will prepare \nindigenous peoples action plans or development plans as \nrequired.  \n    Other risks and vulnerabilities will be determined by the   \n   Significant  TA.
