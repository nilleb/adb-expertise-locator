The \n ", "14  Appendix 4 \nconsultant  will  conduct a financial  management  assessment  of the  executing/implementing \nagencies  and  provide  recommendations  for  funds  flow,  disbursement  mechanisms,  and \ncapacity building needs.   \n \n9.

Other due diligence for development of an investment program \nwill be conducted by Public Financial Management and Costing Specialist (national, 4 \nperson-months),  Governance  Specialist  (national,  2  person-months),  Procurement \nSpecialist  (national,  2  person-months),  Environment  Specialist  (national,  1  person-\nmonth),  Gender  and  Social  Development  Specialist  (national,  2  person-months),  and \nResettlement and Social Development (IP) Specialist (national, 1 person-month).

The Procurement Specialist (national, 2 person-months), in particular, will (i) conduct \nthe EA Procurement Capacity Assessment and prepare the Report and (ii) prepare bidding \ndocuments and Requests for Proposal. To facilitate the preparation of an effective procurement \nplan for the ensuing program, in addition to undertaking capacity assessment of the EA, the \nconsultant will examine the national and/or international market capacity in the relevant sectors, \nsuggest technically and economically sound procurement packaging, and identify, whenever \npossible,  at  least  three  or  more  suitable  suppliers/manufacturers/contractors  for  each \nanticipated  International  or  National  Competitive  Bidding  procurement  package  under  the \nprogram.  \n \n13.   Such identification is purely for the purpose of a preliminary market capacity assessment \nand  does  not  represent  in  any  way  ADB's  endorsement  on  or  preference  to  any \nsuppliers/manufacturers mentioned in the consultant's report. The consultant is required to \ninclude a similar disclaimer in its report. The consultant is also required to include a relationship \ndisclosure  statement  if  the  consultant  is  affiliated  to  any  of  the  potential \nsuppliers/manufacturers/contractors identified in the report. If other procurement modes are \nrecommended for inclusion in the procurement plan such as, for example, Limited International \nBidding or direct procurement, the consultant should provide reasoned justification for such \nrecommendations.  This  approach  also  applies  to  the  framing  of  consultant  recruitment \npackages. \n \n14.   The consultant will share the conclusions of such market survey findings, the results of \nthe  EA  capacity  assessment,  the  proposed  cost  estimates  for  all  procurement  (including \nconsulting services) packages, and the indicative procurement plan (including proposed prior \nand post review thresholds for goods, works and consulting services), with ADB's procurement \ndivision  concerned.  Depending  on  comments  received  from  ADB,  the  consultant  may  be \nrequired to participate in tripartite discussions between ADB (both sector and procurement \n ", "Appendix 4  15 \n \ndivisions) and, as necessary, the EA and take comments received into account in finalization of \nthe indicative procurement plan and other deliverables. \n \n15.
