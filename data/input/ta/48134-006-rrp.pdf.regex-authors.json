I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \npolicy-based  loan  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  subprogram  2  of  the  Stepping  Up \nInvestments for Growth Acceleration Program. \n \n2.  The proposed subprogram 2 supports the government\u2019s main reform priorities in raising \ndomestic and foreign direct investment (FDI) in the economy, and represents a medium- to \nlong-term  partnership  between  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  government. \nSubprogram  2  continues  and  deepens  the  reforms  begun  under  subprogram  1  of  the \nprogrammatic approach approved in September 2014.1 The government\u2019s priority areas include \n(i) creating a more predictable and open business environment, including through (ii) faster and \nmore transparent public investment procurement which in turn will help create (iii) an efficient \nmarket for infrastructure through public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs).2  \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The  development  problem.  The  Indonesian  economy  is  at  a  major  crossroads. \nEconomic growth decelerated from its peak of 6.4% in 2010 to 4.8% in 2015. This is mainly \nbecause the commodity price boom ended and macro policies were tightened to lower inflation \nand the current account deficit. Reliance on commodities has exposed structural weaknesses in \nthe economy, including inefficient investment allocation and underinvestment in infrastructure. \nThese structural weaknesses are reflected in the adjustment to a lower economic growth path, \nwith the economy expected to grow by about 4.9%\u20135.3% in 2016, significantly below the bottom \nof  the  government\u2019s  target  range  of  7.0%\u20139.0%,  stated  in  the  National  Medium-Term \nDevelopment Plan (RPJMN), 2015\u20132019.3 The economic slowdown, combined with volatility in \nglobal financial and commodity markets, has strained fiscal management\u2014with tax revenue \ncollections declining by 2.1% in the first quarter of 2016 compared with the same period in 2015. \nGiven commitments to social and infrastructure spending in the 2016 budget, the fiscal deficit is \nexpected to be higher than the projected deficit of 2.1% of gross domestic product (GDP). \n \n4.  Against this backdrop of slower economic growth, structural adjustment, and increased \nfiscal  pressures,  the government  is  challenged  in  promoting  inclusive growth.  Since  2000, \nIndonesia has experienced one of the largest increases in inequality of all Southeast Asian \neconomies. The Gini index, used to measure household income inequality, increased from 0.30 \nin 2000 to 0.40 in 2015 and is explained in part by insufficient job creation. For example, the \nrate of job creation is insufficient to reduce Indonesia\u2019s 12.2 million youth not in employment, \neducation, or training\u2014the highest rate in Southeast Asia (Figure 1). Uneven economic growth \nacross provinces has also contributed to widening of regional income disparities, with several \nprovinces in eastern Indonesia significantly lagging Java and Bali in per capita income. For \nexample, Jakarta\u2019s 2014 nominal per capita income ($14,816) is 13 times higher than that of \nEast Nusa Tenggara ($1,154).  \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Programmatic \nApproach and Policy-Based Loan for Subprogram 1 to the Republic of Indonesia for Stepping Up Investments for \nGrowth Acceleration Program. Manila. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  The government\u2019s 2016 national budget projects 5.3% growth. ADB. 2016. Asian Development Outlook 2016. \nManila projects 5.2%. The World Bank\u2019s Indonesia quarterly report in March 2016 projects 5.1%, and the \nInternational Monetary Fund 2016 Article IV Staff report projects 4.9%. ", "2 \n5.  Therefore, increasing investment in job-creating industries is a vital government priority. \nThe share of investment to GDP rose slightly to 26.2% in 2014, up from 25.1% in 2010. There is \nalso a strong willingness to embrace FDI. Excluding financial services, Indonesia was ranked \nthe 14th largest recipient of FDI in the world in 2014. Yet investment is inefficient and expensive \ncompared with the income it generates, and too much of it is wasted. For example, a common \nmeasure of investment efficiency is the incremental capital output ratio. In 2014, this ratio was \nhigh, at 5.5, meaning that $5.5 spent on investment produces only $1.0 of income (Figure 2). \nThe incremental capital output ratio in neighboring countries is about 3.0\u20134.0.4 \n \n6.  Indonesia\u2019s  difficult  business  climate  is  one  of  the  reasons  for  this  high-cost  and \ninefficient allocation of investment. According to the World Bank\u2019s 2016 Doing Business Report,5 \nIndonesia is ranked 109th out of 189 countries in ease of doing business. While this is an \nimprovement of 11 places over the 2015 report, it compares unfavorably with many of its \nregional neighbors: Malaysia (18th), the Philippines (103th), Thailand (49th), and Viet Nam \n(90th). A cumbersome business licensing regime has contributed to this high-cost business \nenvironment. Indonesia still retains significant equity restrictions on FDI in the services sector. \nFigure 1: Rates of Youth Not in Employment,  Figure 2: Investment Rate (% of GDP)  \nEducation, or Training \u2013  International  and Incremental Capital Output Ratio \nComparison a   \n \nICOR = incremental capital output ratio; GDP = gross domestic product; OECD = Organisation for Economic Co-\noperation and Development. \na  As a percentage of youth population. Youth refers to 15\u201324 year olds. \nSources: Asian Development Bank estimates; World Bank Development Indicator database; and Eurostat. \n \n7.  The  adjustment  to  a  lower  economic  growth  path  is  also  the  result  of  years  of \nunderinvestment in the availability and quality of infrastructure in Indonesia compared with most \nof its neighbors. The World Economic Forum\u2019s  Global Competitiveness Report 2015\u20132016 \nranks Indonesia 62nd out of 140 countries on the quality of its overall infrastructure\u2014well below \nMalaysia (24th) and Thailand (44th).6 This is the result of low public infrastructure investment \nspending (average of 1.5% of GDP from 2008 to 2012); inadequate private participation in \ninfrastructure investment (average of 0.6% of GDP from 2008 to 2012); and an inefficient public \nprocurement system, where 45.0% of budget disbursements are made in the last 2 months of \nthe fiscal year, creating a drag on public infrastructure delivery. Indonesia\u2019s annual infrastructure \ninvestment needs are estimated at 6.2% of GDP (3.9% of GDP in transport, 1.0% of GDP in \nenergy, 1.0% of GDP in telecommunications, and 0.4% of GDP in water and sanitation).7 \n                                                \n4  Sector Assessment (Summary): Industry and Trade (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n5  World Bank. 2016.

The government has recognized the set of challenges it needs to \ndeal  with  to  increase  investment  in  job-creating  industries,  including  (i)  addressing  the \nproliferation  of  high-cost  business  regulations  that  deters  investors,  (ii)  accelerating \ninfrastructure delivery through increased participation of the private sector, and (iii) resolving \ninefficiencies in the public procurement system to speed up delivery of infrastructure projects. \n \n9.  High-cost business regulatory environment. A proliferation of regulations (both at \nnational and subnational levels), cumbersome licensing procedures, and remaining restrictions \non foreign investment, particularly in services, have created a high-cost business environment. \nThe  average  number  of  regulations  issued  by  both  national  and  subnational  governments \nincreased from 453 per year during 1999\u20132003 to 1,789 per year in 2010\u20132014. Starting a \nbusiness in Indonesia requires an investor to obtain 10 approvals, and the process takes 48 \ndays compared with three approvals and 6 days in Malaysia. Indonesia would benefit from \nadopting  international  good  regulatory  practice,  such  as  mandatory  regulatory  impact \nassessments for significant regulatory proposals. Tax administration also imposes significant \nbusiness compliance costs on investors, such as the predominance of manual tax return filing \nand tax payment procedures. Moreover, the negative investment list has placed binding ceilings \non direct foreign equity investment in the services sector, impeding growth prospects in these \nsectors and Indonesia\u2019s progress in meeting its ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) goals.8 \n \n10.  Inefficient  market  for  infrastructure  investment.  Increasing  public  infrastructure \nspending is critical to address the country\u2019s infrastructure deficit and for crowding-in private \nparticipation in infrastructure. A poor institutional, policy, and regulatory framework for promoting \nprivate participation in infrastructure investment projects, and the lack of long-term financing for \ninfrastructure investments have also contributed to an inefficient market for infrastructure in \nIndonesia.  Four  main  policy  impediments  affect  private  participation  in  infrastructure \ninvestments in Indonesia. First, until 2014 the government did not have a PPP unit and a project \ndevelopment facility for financing feasibility studies and transaction advisory services, which are \nboth important for facilitating private participation in public infrastructure projects. As a result of \nthis undeveloped institutional framework, the government does not have capacities to develop \nand implement a robust pipeline of PPP infrastructure projects. Second, financial and fiscal risks \narising from PPP infrastructure projects need to be managed and budgeted for, such as the \ngovernment providing grants\u2013known as viability gap funding (VGF)\u2013to the PPP entity to ensure \nthe  commercial  viability  of  the  PPP  project.  Performance-based  payments\u2013known  as \navailability-based PPP contracts\u2013are also necessary to ensure quality projects. Third, a major \nconstraint to private participation in infrastructure investments is the absence of a long-term \nasset class that can provide long-term financing for public infrastructure through the capital \nmarket. Fourth, the land acquisition process needs to be made more timely, transparent, and \nfair to allow for more private sector participation in public infrastructure projects. \n \n11.  Inefficient  public  procurement  system.  Inefficiencies  in  public  procurement  are \nreflected in the concentration of public infrastructure procurement (45%) toward the end of each \nfiscal year because of lengthy procurement approval processes.9 Improving transparency and \nthe  professionalism  of  procurement  officers,  as  well  as  promoting  competition  in  public \nprocurement,  are  necessary  to  accelerate  the  delivery  of  infrastructure  investments.  The \ngovernment will need to adopt international standards in public procurement practices, such as \ne-procurement systems, and introduce international competitive bidding documents to enable \nforeign firms to compete in the domestic market on a level playing field. \n                                                \n8  The AEC aims to create a single market in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.  \n9  Data are taken from the National Public Procurement Agency Monitoring and Evaluation system. \n ", "4 \n12.  Government reform agenda. To raise the economic growth rate above the 2016 range \nof 4.9%\u20135.3%, the government recognizes that it needs to pursue structural reforms to allocate \ninvestment more efficiently to job-creating industries. The new RPJMN, 2015\u20132019 cites income \ninequality reduction as one of its main priorities. Employment creation can help reduce income \ninequality. To achieve it, the RPJMN calls for an increased effort and resources for education, \nskills development, finance sector development, energy sector development, and investment in \ninfrastructure; and mandates continued reform of the investment and business climate. The \nRPJMN identifies initiatives to simplify investment procedures and regulatory reform, liberalize \nFDI,  increase  budget  spending  on  public  infrastructure,  increase  private  participation  in \ninfrastructure projects, resolve land acquisition impediments, and improve public procurement. \nConsistent with this focus, since September 2015 the government has announced 12 economic \nreform packages aimed at simplifying business and logistics regulations and procedures, and \nremoving nontariff barriers to trade. It also considers achieving its AEC goals a catalyst for \nfurther domestic investment climate reforms. \n  \n13.  ADB\u2019s  experience.  ADB  has  supported  reforms  in  the  investment  climate  through \nseveral loan programs, technical assistance (TA), and knowledge products (Figure 3). In 2001, \nthe  focus  was  on  state-owned  enterprises  reform  and  small  and  medium-sized  enterprise \ndevelopment, but this has shifted to improving public infrastructure policy and connectivity \nacross Indonesia. Since 2014, ADB has focused on sector reforms\u2014with the goal of improving \nthe investment climate using an integrated sector approach. ADB\u2019s Board of Directors approved \nthe Stepping Up Investments for Growth Acceleration programmatic approach and subprogram \n1 loan in September 2014, and established a structured medium- to long-term engagement on \ninvestment climate reforms with the new government (footnote 1). ADB has provided a series of \nTA projects to support the implementation of reforms under the program.10 Through subprogram \n2, ADB will continue to work with the government to create a predictable and open business \nclimate, build an efficient market for infrastructure  by strengthening the government\u2019s PPP \nprogram and diversified modalities of infrastructure financing, and improve public procurement \nfor faster delivery of infrastructure projects. The program supplements ADB\u2019s financial market \ndevelopment  and  inclusion  program,  approved  by  the  Board  in  September  2015,  which \naddresses  impediments  to  capital  market  development  and  long-term  financing  of \ninfrastructure.11 The inclusive energy program, also approved by ADB in 2015, supports a better \ninvestment  climate  by  addressing  Indonesia\u2019s  energy  deficit.12 In  2016,  together  with  the \ngovernment, ADB is preparing an education sector reform program that aims to improve the \nquality of education and address the youth skills mismatch in the labor market. ADB is also \npreparing an engineering project that aims to improve the quality and timely start-up of public \ninfrastructure projects, which could be a catalyst for lifting public infrastructure spending.13 \nADB\u2019s Office of PPP is discussing with the government the provision of advisory services to the \nNorth Sumatra provincial government to develop Rawasaring, a 100-kilometer brownfield road. \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2014.

Lessons from the experience. A \u201cOne ADB\u201d approach\u2014where all departments provide \nhighly  coordinated  support  to  the  government\u2019s  economic  reforms\u2014improves  program \neffectiveness and creates reform impact. This includes support for a medium-term policy reform \nframework, sustained capacity development TA, knowledge products, and an integrated sector \napproach to improving the investment climate with program- and project-specific support. A \nsecond lesson is the need to engage with local governments in a decentralized system and to \nprovide sustained capacity development TA to enable local governments to pilot test reforms. \nAs a result of progress in these two areas, ADB support is shifting to policy dialogue and \nreforms at both the national and subnational levels, and taking an integrated sector approach to \nimproving the investment climate. \n \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank \n \n15.  ADB\u2019s value added to the program design and implementation. Key policy reforms \nunder subprogram 1 included raising foreign equity ceilings in land transportation, shipping, and \nmanagement of ports; establishing KPPIP to screen, monitor, and evaluate 30 national strategic \nprojects for selection under the PPP program; establishing a dedicated office to formulate land \nacquisition policy; and initiating the development of e-procurement. Reforms proposed under \nsubprogram  2  focuses  on  operationalizing  reforms  and  securing  budget  allocations.  This \nincludes further liberalizing foreign ownership in the services sector; operationalizing the KPPIP \nand the National One Stop Service (OSS) Center for large investors; establishing the PPP Unit \nat the Ministry of Finance (MOF), and the Project Development Fund (PDF) under the PPP Unit; \nand  implementing  e-procurement  systems  in  the  national  government  and  pilot  testing  in \nselected local governments. \n \n16.  ADB  has  provided  direct  support  to  the  completion  of  reforms  proposed  under \nsubprogram  2.  The  project  preparatory  TA  (footnote  10)  provided  advisory  support  to  the \nCoordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs (the executing agency) and Indonesia Investment \nCoordinating Board (BKPM) on business climate reforms based on the TA-funded assessment \nof the ease of doing business in five local governments, including Jakarta and Surabaya. These \nefforts provided input to the government\u2019s most recent economic reform packages coordinated \n ", "6 \nthrough the executing agency. The TA on municipal bonds (footnote 10) provided capacity \ndevelopment  support  to  the  West  Java  provincial  government  on  debt  management  and \nissuance of municipal bonds. ADB\u2019s TA on tax administration (footnote 10), funded by the \nGovernment of Switzerland, provided policy and capacity development support to the Jakarta \nlocal  government  to  strengthen  its  tax  administration  systems.  Also  under  the  project \npreparatory TA (footnote 10), ADB assisted the Jakarta local government to establish an e-\nprocurement platform for competitive bidding on supplier contracts. \n \n17.  The results have been impressive. In November 2015, the OSS center issued almost \n9,600 licenses. Under the strengthened PPP program, three PPP projects have been prepared \nand one contract signed. Total public procurement delivery through e-procurement increased \nfrom Rp2.8 trillion ($212 million) in 2013 to Rp580.9 trillion ($4.4 billion) in 2015. Under the \npublic e-procurement system, close to 43,500 items are listed in the e-catalog.  \n \n18.  Development partner coordination. Development partner coordination is strong in the \ninvestment,  trade,  PPP,  and  public  procurement  reform  areas.  German  development \ncooperation through KfW provided parallel financing in the amount of a $245 million loan for \nsubprogram 1 and is considering parallel financing for subprogram 2 with an indicative amount \nof \u20ac200 million ($224.6 million equivalent). Both the ADB and KfW teams have worked closely \nwith the Government of Indonesia in formulating the program. The Government of Switzerland \nhas also provided cofinancing through a $5 million grant for ADB\u2019s local tax administration \nreform project (footnote 10). The Government of Australia, the Government of the United States, \nand the World Bank are providing separate and coordinated support to the government on \ninvestment climate and PPP reforms.14 \n \n19.  Policy-based loan, budget support, and changes to the programmatic approach\u2014\nadditional subprogram. ADB will continue its programmatic support to increase investment. \nThis  approach  uses  policy-based  lending  in  conjunction  with  extensive  policy  dialogue  in \nrecognition  of  the  long-term  horizon  required  for  investment  climate  reforms.  In  addition, \nsubprogram 2 contains significant additional reforms not originally contemplated in subprogram \n1, such as the national regulatory reform program. Demonstrating this long-term commitment to \ninvestment climate reforms, the government has requested an additional subprogram 3 for \nconsideration  in  2018,  with  increased  focus  on  its  national  regulatory  reform  program, \ninstitutional reforms for good regulatory practice, and its PPP program; and aligns the program \nwith the RPJMN, 2015\u20132019. \n \n20.  Economic impact of the program. The three outputs of the program combined are \nexpected to raise public and private investments. Potential economic gains are to be achieved \nthrough efficiency gains: (i) a lower regulatory burden on businesses and a more open FDI \nregime; (ii) project costs within budget and timely completion of PPP projects, and an increase \nin the overall level of infrastructure investments, which would not have occurred without the PPP \nprogram;  and  (iii)  improved  public  procurement  in  terms  of  lower  bid  prices  and  timely \nprocurement (para. 31). \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n21.  The impact will be increased investment as a share of GDP, in alignment with the \nRPJMN, 2015\u20132019. The outcome will be public and private sector investments increased. At \nthe inception of the programmatic approach in 2014, the government agreed to 22 indicative \n                                                \n14 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of the linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \npolicy actions as a basis for subprogram 2. At the government\u2019s request, ADB agreed to \nsharpen the focus of subprogram 2 and to rationalize some of the measures by concentrating \non key reforms. Through the process, eight completed indicative actions under subprogram 2 \nwere combined into four actions, six new policy actions were added, five completed actions \nwere dropped, and one ongoing action was dropped from the program as no follow-up actions \nwould be necessary.15 Subprogram 2 now contains 18 reform actions (10 expected prior actions \nrepresenting high-impact reforms and eight milestones), which the government completed from \nOctober 2014 to June 2016. The change in the policy matrix is reflected in the revised design \nand monitoring framework (Appendix 1). Subprogram 3 contains 18 policy actions of which 8 \nare expected prior actions. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n22.  Output 1: More predictable and open business environment. This output builds on \naccomplishments under subprogram 1 to ease restrictions on domestic and foreign investments \nin  three  important  ways.  First,  through  a  series  of  announcements  of  economic  reform \npackages, the government began a national regulatory reform program. Over 147 business, \nlogistics, and trade regulations were either simplified or eliminated. To assist with identifying and \nprioritizing regulations for review and reform, selected ministries and agencies including the \nMinistry of Trade established deregulation units with designated staff. Second, the government \nhas issued Presidential Regulation that sets out the revised negative investment list, further \nliberalizing foreign investment by allowing at least 67% foreign ownership in investments in the \nservices sector\u2014covering the creative industries (100% in film studios, movie production, and \ndistribution), tourism-related industries (100% in hotels and restaurants), and other recreation \nenterprises. This is a major reform to the services sector, which will promote new investments \nand jobs. It also accomplishes the government\u2019s AEC commitments to liberalize foreign equity \nrestrictions.  Third,  the  government  reformed  licensing  procedures.  A  major  reform  under \nsubprogram 2 was the 22 line ministries delegating licensing approval authority to BKPM\u2019s OSS \ncenter\u2014significantly reducing transaction costs for investors. By the end of 2015, the OSS \ncenter had issued over 9,000 licenses to large investors. Another related reform was BKPM \nreducing the administrative time to obtain the eight mandatory national licenses from 23 days to \n3 hours, and the Jakarta local government reducing the time it takes to obtain local trading \nlicenses and enterprise registration certificates to 3 hours. \n \n23.  For  subprogram  3,  the  government  will  implement  good  regulatory  practices  by \ninstitutionalizing  a  systematic  regulatory  review  program.  This  will  include  setting  up  an \ninterministerial steering committee to oversee the implementation of good regulatory practices \nand pilot testing regulatory impact assessment programs in selected ministries or agencies.  \n \n24.  Output 2: Creating an efficient market for infrastructure through public\u2013private \npartnerships.  Output 2 builds on efforts to develop a robust pipeline of PPP projects by \nstrengthening the institutional, policy, and regulatory framework for PPPs; and expanding the \nfinancing modalities for long-term financing of infrastructure. These accomplishments included \nthe following. First, building on subprogram 1, the government operationalized the KPPIP to \nscreen strategic projects for the PPP program. Second, the government strengthened its PPP \nstructure by establishing the PPP Unit in the MOF to complement the existing PPP directorate in \nthe  National  Development  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS),  which  is  responsible  for  PPP \nplanning. The new MOF PPP Unit has a PDF to facilitate and prepare PPP projects. Third, the \n                                                \n15 Reconciliation of the Original Subprogram 2 to the Revised Subprogram 2 (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \ngovernment has expanded PPPs to social infrastructure, such as in the health and education \nsectors. An availability based scheme for PPP projects was also introduced. These reforms \nhave resulted in the signing of the two availability-based PPP contracts for a telecommunication \nproject. The government has also completed the competitive bidding process for a water supply \nPPP project, with the support of the PPP Unit. In addition, the government has implemented \nmeasures to reduce the fiscal and financial risks of PPP projects. The budget allocation for VGF \nin the 2016 budget has been increased to Rp1.1 trillion ($86 million) from Rp814 billion ($62 \nmillion) in the 2015 budget. The MOF has also approved VGF for three main national water \nsupply PPP projects. The government has enhanced transparency, efficiency, and predictability \nin the land acquisition process for infrastructure projects by allowing the private sector to fund \nland acquisition on the government\u2019s behalf. It has also introduced time-bound procedures for \nthe  preparation  and  implementation  of  land  acquisition,  and  required  land  compensation \npayments to be made within 7 days after validation of claims. Finally, the government has \ncontinued to expand financing modalities for the public share of capital expenditure of PPP \nprojects,  including  increasing  issuances  of  sukuk  (Sharia  compliance  bond),  the  MOF \nconsolidating its infrastructure financing facilities, and capacity development of West Java local \ngovernment on debt management in preparation for issuing municipal bonds. \n \n25.  Under  subprogram  3,  the  government  will  continue  to  strengthen  the  PPP  policy \nframework by enabling local governments to use availability-based PPP schemes, enhancing \nthe PDF mechanism, and clarifying the treatment of unsolicited PPP proposal. MOF will also \nstreamline the approval process for VGF and ensure adequate budget allocation for VGF. \n \n26.  Output  3:  Faster  and  more  transparent  public  procurement.  Continuing  from \nsubprogram 1, the government mandated the use of an e-procurement system for all public \nprocurement of goods and services, which increased total public procurement delivery through \ne-procurement from Rp2.8 trillion ($213 million) in 2013 to Rp580.9 trillion ($4.4 billion) in 2015. \nThe National Public Procurement Agency (LKPP), with the Jakarta local government, introduced \nan electronic platform for transparent competitive bidding for procurement of local goods and \nservices. It also opened up foreign firms\u2019 direct participation in competitive bidding for large \npublic infrastructure projects by  introducing international competitive bidding documents for \nprocurement of goods and services. \n \n27.  For subprogram 3, the LKPP will continue to strengthen the public procurement legal \nframework to incorporate procurement audit, and will enhance the e-procurement system to \ninclude reverse auction of goods. LKPP will also assist the Jakarta local government in pilot \ntesting an electronic platform for a transparent bidding process. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n28.  The government has requested a policy-based loan of $500 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance subprogram 2. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a \ngrace period of 3 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on this, the \naverage loan maturity is 9.25 years, and no maturity premium is payable to ADB. The loan \nproceeds will be used to finance the full exchange cost (excluding local taxes and duties) of \nitems produced and procured in ADB members, excluding ineligible items and imports financed \nby  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  The  proceeds  of  the  policy-based  loan  will  be \ndisbursed  to  Indonesia  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  on  simplifying  disbursement \n ", "9 \nrequirements  for  program  loans.16 The  German  development  cooperation  through  KfW  is \nconsidering parallel financing of subprogram 2. \n \n29.  In the 2016 budget, the net development financing needs are $19.6 billion. With the \ncontinuing economic slowdown in 2016, which has negatively affected tax revenue collections, \nthe government has increased overseas development assistance loans from $3.9 billion to \n$5.4 billion in the revised 2016 budget. The size of the loan primarily reflects the government\u2019s \nfinancing needs, the strength of the reform program, and the implementation costs (para. 31). \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n30.  The  Coordinating  Ministry  for  Economic  Affairs,  the  executing  agency,  will  be \nresponsible for coordinating the government\u2019s economic reform packages. The MOF; BKPM; \nthe Ministry of Agrarian and Spatial Planning; PT Sarana Multi Infrastruktur (Persero), a state-\nowned infrastructure financing company; and LKPP will be the implementing agencies. The \nimplementation  of  program  policy  actions  will  be  monitored  through  a  steering  committee \nchaired by a deputy minister of the executing agency, and will consist of senior representatives \nfrom the implementing agencies. The implementation period is September 2014\u2013June 2016 for \nsubprogram 2, and July 2016\u2013June 2018 for subprogram 3.  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic \n \n31.  The program will have positive economy-wide effects. The program impact assessment \nestimates  the  potential  net  quantifiable  benefits  of  the  program  at  $6.9 billion,  under \nconservative discounting assumptions, which well exceed the program\u2019s estimated costs. 17 Of \nthis,  about  $2.5  billion  flows  to  the  economy  as  a  result  of  increased  trade  and  foreign \ninvestment  inflows  caused  by  better  regulation,  improved  ease  of  doing  business,  and \nstreamlined tax collection measures at national and subnational levels, particularly with respect \nto starting up a business. A further $1.3 billion is expected to come from better preparation of \nPPP projects, improved public debt management capacity at subnational level, and a better land \nacquisition process. A better public procurement process would also strengthen the governance \noutlook in Indonesia, and this is expected to have a net present benefit of $3.4 billion. The \nreforms will entail costs about $500 million. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n32.  The government has made considerable progress in improving the legal and regulatory \nframework for public financial management. Since the enactment of laws on state finance, state \ntreasury, and state audit in 2003\u20132004, most regulations underpinning these laws have been \npromulgated. In 2012, the number of government agencies that received an unqualified audit \nopinion from the external audit agency increased to 65%, from about 40% in 2009. ADB has \nreinforced this momentum with continuing support to improve technical capacity and controls. \nAs a result of the government\u2019s continuing commitment to reduce corruption, the capacity of the \nCorruption Eradication Commission has improved markedly. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, \nas amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \n                                                \n16 ADB. 1998.

Manila. \n17 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n33.  The reforms supported under the program will contribute to reduced income inequality \nand  poverty  reduction. A  more  conducive  investment  climate  will  lead  to more  and  better \ninvestment in job-creating industries. Better infrastructure will contribute to poverty reduction \nthrough higher growth and by improved connectivity of more remote areas to markets. Given the \nmacro nature of the program\u2019s reforms, no gender benefits are directly observed. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n34.  The program does not trigger ADB\u2019s safeguard policies and is classified category C for \nimpacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n35.  Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and \nrisk management plan.18 The expected net benefits and impacts of the program are expected to \noutweigh the risks. At the macroeconomic level, medium-level risks include the continuation of \nthe global economic slowdown, which affects budget allocations for infrastructure. Development \npartners are providing coordinated support to the government to safeguard budget revenues \nand  expenditures.  At  the  microeconomic  level,  there  are  medium-term  risks  that  local \ngovernments will resist regulatory reforms and vested interests may resist structural reforms. \nADB will continue to assist the government in improving the regulation making process and \nfacilitating stakeholder consultations. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n36.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of subprogram 2 shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan \ndocuments. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n37.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based loan would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n(i)  a change in the programmatic approach to include an additional subprogram, as \nfurther described in para. 19; and \n(ii)  the loan of $500,000,000 to the Republic of Indonesia for subprogram 2 of the \nStepping Up Investments for Growth Acceleration Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 15 \nyears, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n6 June 2016   \n                                                \n18 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Program is Aligned with \nInvestment increased as a share of GDP (National Medium-Term Development Plan, 2015\u20132019)a \n  Performance Indicators with Targets  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2019:     \nPublic and private  a.
