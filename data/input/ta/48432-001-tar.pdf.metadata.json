INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Bangladesh is working to eliminate acute power shortages and load \nshedding  within  the  country,  and  to  electrify  all  rural  villages  by  2020.  Following  the \ngovernment\u2019s request, on 4 January 2012 the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the \nPower  System  Efficiency  Improvement  Project,  which  aims  to  address  two  key  areas  in \nelectricity supply: improving thermal power plants and expanding the penetration of renewable \nenergy in the country.1 \n \n2.  As part of the government\u2019s commitment to integrate gender and social considerations in \nthe energy sector and identify entry points to address gender and social inclusion issues related \nto the power subsector, ADB was asked in September 2014 to assist in developing a strategy to \nexpand the integration of gender-related activities into the ongoing Power System Efficiency \nImprovement Project. The goal is to increase gender equality results by using new off-grid \nrenewable energy options to maximize the hybrid power system in Hatiya Island. \n \n3.  The scope of the technical assistance (TA) includes (i) increasing women\u2019s participation \nin  energy-related  employment  and  energy-based  livelihood  opportunities  resulting  from  the \nongoing  project;  (ii)  providing  technical  training  for  women  to  enable  them  to  maximize \nopportunities; and (iii) providing a gender-sensitive user education program module to improve \nhousehold energy efficiency, targeting poor households headed by women on the safe and \nefficient use of electricity; and (iv) elaborating a customized dissemination and user-friendly \neducational campaign on the efficient management of services provided by the new hybrid \npower technologies.2 The gender action plan will continue to be implemented using proceeds \nfrom the loan under the ongoing project (footnote 1).3 \n \n4.  The  TA  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan,  2015\u20132017  for \nBangladesh, which prioritizes energy as a key area of support, with a primary goal to reduce \ndependency  on  imported  fossil  fuels  by  implementing  energy  efficiency  and  conservation, \nincluding power generation from indigenous renewable energy sources.4 Gender equity is one \nof ADB\u2019s five drivers of change within its overarching goal of poverty reduction. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  Lack of access to modern energy services is an important indicator of poverty and the \nstate of social development. Regional demand for electricity in South Asia is steadily rising with \ncontinued economic development and is expected to increase, with households and industry as \nthe main consumers. According to ADB\u2019s Energy Outlook, South Asia will register the fastest \nannual growth rate in Asia and the Pacific for electricity demand at 5.3%, a more than threefold \nincrease  (from  2010)  to  2,761.6  terawatt-hours  by  2035.5 The  key  challenge  remains  the \nsector\u2019s sustainable development to provide secure and high-quality electricity services for all. \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2011. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Power System Efficiency Improvement Project. Manila (Loan 2769-BAN, \nPart B[ii]), Hatiya Solar Photovoltaic-Wind-Diesel Hybrid System (comprising 2.2-megawatt peak photovoltaic \npower, 2 megawatts diesel power, 0.8 megawatts wind power, and 5 megawatt-hours energy storage. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 8 December 2014.  \n3  The TA builds on activities included in the (original) gender action plan, and develops it by including support to \nwomen-friendly renewable energy technologies and user education programs. \n4  ADB. 2014. Country Operations Business Plan: Bangladesh, 2015\u20132017. Manila. \n5  ADB. 2013. Energy Outlook. Manila. \n ", "2 \n \n6.  In Bangladesh, energy shortage is considered the most critical constraint to economic \ndevelopment, livelihoods, and quality of life, especially in rural areas. A gender-oriented and \nproperly engineered, improved, and reliable power supply will enhance women\u2019s energy-related \nlivelihood opportunities and reduce their household drudgery, while supporting environmental \nsustainability. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact will be increased employment and livelihood opportunities in Hatiya Island \nfor women living below the poverty line (BPL) and vulnerable women. The outcome will be more \nefficient, gender- and socially-inclusive access to energy resources and services. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  Improving  coverage  by  expanding  and  strengthening  transmission  and  distribution \nsystems is essential. Thus, poor beneficiaries can benefit significantly from (i) access to quality \nenergy  services  for  domestic  consumption  and  increased  leisure;  (ii)  time-saving  through \nimproved  efficiency  of  work;  (iii)  use  of  labor-saving  appliances  for  homes,  industry,  and \nagricultural production; and (iv) related employment generation and livelihoods. Other benefits \ninclude  information  and  communication,  pumped  water,  improved  health,  and  other  basic \nservices obtained through improved power infrastructure.6 \n \n9.  The TA will specifically target BPL women and households headed by women for the \nsafe and efficient use of electricity, and make available a customized dissemination and user-\nfriendly educational campaign for the efficient management of electricity services provided by \npower technologies, such as photovoltaic, wind, battery storage, and diesel generation. The TA \nwill have four outputs. \n \n10.  Output 1. Local power infrastructure improved to maximize benefits for BPL women and \nhouseholds  headed  by  women.  This  includes  community-based  solar  irrigation  pumping \nsystems for effective agriculture, photovoltaic street lighting in selected areas, nano-grid cluster \ngrid  to  connect  households  located  far  from  the  main  grid,  community-based  photovoltaic \nrefrigerators for preserving fish catch, and internet access provided through one community e-\ncenter for increased information dissemination and learning.  \n \n11.  Output  2. Women\u2019s participation as entrepreneurs and service providers increased. \nSkills and technical training will be provided to enhance women\u2019s energy-based alternative \nlivelihood opportunities through local power infrastructure development, and implementation of \nelectrical connections and electricity billing within the output-based aid program (the grant-\nfinanced electrical connection from households to the distribution grid).   \n  \n                                                \n6  Safeguards related to infrastructure construction footprint (panels, batteries, pumps, reservoir, and irrigation \nchannels  of  community-based  solar  irrigation  pumping  systems;  street  lighting;  grid  poles  (nano-grid);  and \ncommunity e-center will have no indigenous peoples, resettlement, or land acquisition issues, or any loss of access \nissues. The Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) will provide public land. The infrastructure will create \nnew livelihoods. Minor environmental impacts originating from the construction and disposal of waste materials and \nbatteries will be addressed through the environmental management system implemented by BPDB for the ongoing \nPower  System  Efficiency  Improvement  Project.  Appropriate  assessments  are  being  conducted  to  assess \nenvironment impact \n ", "3 \n \n12.  Output  3.  Gender-sensitive  user  education  program  developed  and  implemented. \nAwareness-raising materials will be prepared and a user education program implemented on \nthe safe and efficient use of electricity targeting poor households headed by women.  \n \n13.  Output 4. BPDB capacity in gender- and socially-inclusive community outreach and \nengagement developed. This will increase BPDB sensitivity for gender- and socially-inclusive \ncommunity involvement in project activities. \n \n14.  The main assumptions are (i) macroeconomic and political stability exists in the country; \n(ii) project ownership by BPDB and key stakeholders is strong; (iii) local government supports \nlocal infrastructure development, despite changes in the national political landscape; (iv) project \nownership  by  the  government,  local  communities,  and  target  beneficiaries  is  strong;  and  \n(v)  BPDB  accepts  the  need  to  address  gender  issues  in  a  sustained  manner.  The  only \nforeseeable risk is the possibility of rapid staff turnover in BPDB. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $530,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund and administered by \nADB. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \nspace,  transportation  and  accommodation  (project  site  visits,  support  for  workshops  and \nconferences, office supplies, secretariat assistance, domestic transportation), and other in-kind \ncontributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The executing agency will be BPDB, within the Power Division of the Ministry of Power, \nEnergy and Mineral Resources. BPDB and ADB will monitor the TA outcome through consultant \nreports, periodic consultations, and review missions. BPDB will provide additional field-related \ntechnical expertise as needed. \n \n17.  The TA will require 9 person-months of international and 11 person-months of national \nconsulting inputs, and 4 person-months of non-key experts (community development support \nstaff and facilitators). ADB will hire a consulting firm in accordance with its Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Goods, including all equipment, will \nbe procured by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended \nfrom time to time).7 The team of experts will (i) support turnkey implementation of equipment; (ii) \nprovide technical knowledge transfer to beneficiaries; and (iii) prepare scaling up of the pilot \nequipment  in  other  projects  of  the  2015\u20132017  power  portfolio  (i.e.,  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  Power \nSystem Efficiency Improvement Project, part B; Photovoltaic Pumps for Agricultural Irrigation \nProject; and project preparatory TA project8 for Rural Hybrid Power Systems Project).  \n \n18.  At  the  end  of  TA  implementation,  through  capacity  building  and  training,  women \nbeneficiaries in Hatiya are expected to be organized into electricity committees, which together \nwith BPDB will support operation and maintenance of the pilot equipment and sale of electricity \n                                                \n7  Funding for equipment is administered by ADB and will not be included as part of the technical and financial \nproposal of the consulting services. After TA completion, the ownership of the equipment will be turned over to the \nBPDB. The disposal arrangements of the equipment upon TA completion will be done by BPDB.  \n8  ADB. 2015.
