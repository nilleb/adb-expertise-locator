Initial environmental examinations were carried out \nAssessment  for all subprojects, and summary is attached in Supplementary \nAppendix 10.  \n   \nProject Description  The  Project  consists  of  two  components:  one  for  physical \ninfrastructure  construction  and  rehabilitation,  and  the  other  for \ninstitutional  reform  and  capacity  building.  The  Project  will  be \nimplemented in three secondary towns: Agdash, Goychay, and \nNakhchivan. The Project will pilot test approaches for the WSS \nsector  as  a  basis  for  sector-wide  reforms  in  the  country\u2019s \nsecondary towns.  \n   \nRationale  The water supply and sanitation (WSS) sector in Azerbaijan is \ncharacterized by institutional weaknesses, inefficient operations, \noutdated  and  dilapidated  physical  infrastructure,  and  severe \nfinancial constraints. As a result, consumers receive poor quality \nand low levels of WSS services. The institutional capacity of town \nWSS agencies (\u201cSuKanals\u201d) is limited. They are predominantly \nengineering-focused,  with  insufficient  attention  given  to \nmaintenance  and  efficiency  in  operations,  planning,  financial \nmanagement,  and  commercial  performance.  The  Project  will \naddress  the  key  constraints  by  constructing  and  rehabilitating \nphysical  WSS  infrastructure  and  by  implementing  institutional, \nmanagerial, and financial reform and capacity building of the new \nutilities.  \n   \nObjectives  The  project  objective  is  to  improve  the  quality,  reliability,  and \nsustainability of WSS services in the towns of Agdash, Goychay, \nand Nakhchivan.  \n   \nCost Estimates  The total project cost is estimated at $39.9 million equivalent, \ncomprising  $20.7  million  equivalent  in  foreign  exchange  cost \n(52%) and $19.2 million equivalent  (48%) in local currency cost. \nTaxes and duties included in the total cost are estimated at $4.9 \nmillion equivalent.  \n ", "iv     \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \n  Foreign  Local     \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Total  % \n \nADF Loan  12.3  7.7  20.0  50\nOCR Loan  8.4  1.6  10.0  25\nGovernment  0.0  9.9  9.9  25\nTotal  20.7  19.2  39.9  100\n   \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide a blend of two \nloans: a loan of $20.0 million equivalent from its Special Funds \nresources (Asian Development Fund (ADF) loan), and a loan of \n$10.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR loan). \nThe Government will provide the remaining costs of $9.9 million \nequivalent. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  The ADF loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing \nRights 13.58 million will have a maturity of 32 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years, an interest charge of 1% per year during \nthe grace period, and 1.5% thereafter, and terms and conditions \nset forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements. The OCR loan \nof $10.0 million will have a 25-year term including a grace period \nof 6 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a \ncommitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  and  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement.  \n   \nAllocation and Relending  Part  of  the  ADF  loan  ($8.0  million)  will  be  re-lent  from  the \nTerms  Government to AzerSu Joint Stock Company (AzerSu), which in \nturn  will  on-lend  it  to  the  Agdash  and  Goychay  Joint  Stock \nCompanies (JSCs). A portion of the OCR loan equivalent to $9.3 \nmillion will be re-lent from the Government to the Nakhchivan \nJSC. All subsidiary loans and subloans will have identical terms, \nwill be in Azerbaijan manats, and their terms and conditions will \nbe defined in subsidiary and subloan agreements satisfactory to \nADB. The Government will bear the interest and foreign exchange \nrisks, which will be reflected in the relending and onlending terms. \nThe JSCs will repay these subloans through collection of user \ncharges. The grant portion in the amount of $11.6 million will be \ntransferred  through  budgetary  appropriations  to  the  Executing \nAgencies and further to the JSCs.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2011 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2010 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agencies  AzerSu for the Agdash and Goychay subprojects, and the State \nCommittee  for  Construction  and  Architecture  of  Nakhchivan \nAutonomous Republic for the Nakhchivan subproject. \n   \n ", "  v\nImplementation  An interagency project steering committee will be established to \nArrangements  provide policy guidance and steer the proposed reforms through \ngovernment  bureaucracy.  Both  Executing  Agencies  will  assign \nsenior officials as project directors; establish and operate project \nmanagement  units  (PMUs);  be  responsible  for  both  the \nestablishment  and  monitoring  of  the  JSCs,  and  closure  and \nliquidation of the existing WSS operators (SuKanals). The JSCs \nwill be formed to operate, manage, and maintain the new WSS \nfacilities in the three project towns. The JSCs will own the physical \nassets, will engage a performance-based management contractor \n(MC) to operate the system for an initial 4-year period, and will \ndevelop the capability and capacity of the new JSCs personnel \nthrough  on-the-job  training.  During  project  implementation  the \nJSCs  will  supervise  construction  and  form  the  local  project \nimplementation  units  (PIUs).  The  PIUs  will  operate  the  WSS \nservices during the construction stage, and old facilities will be \nprogressively  phased  out  as  the  new  WSS  facilities  come  on \nstream. Selected operational staff from the former SuKanals will \nbe retained for the purpose. Upon construction completion the \nPIUs will hand over the WSS facilities to JSCs\u2019 operational units.   \n   \nProcurement  Goods and services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. Civil works estimated to cost $1.0 \nmillion equivalent or more, and equipment and materials that will \ncost  $500,000  or  more,  will  be  procured  using  international \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures. Civil  works  valued  under  $1.0 \nmillion  equivalent  will  be  procured  through  local  competitive \nbidding in accordance with Government procedures acceptable to \nADB. Equipment and materials packages valued under $500,000 \nwill be procured through international shopping procedures.  \n   \nConsulting Services  The Project will provide about 68 person-months of international \nand  570  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  to \nsupport project implementation, including preparation of detailed \ndesign,  procurement  and  contracting,  construction  supervision, \nfinance and accounting, and social assessment. The Government \nwill  select  and  engage  an  international  consulting  firm  in \nassociation with domestic consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  Other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB may be used to engage domestic consultants. \nThe  international  consulting  firm  will  be  recruited  using  ADB's \nquality-and-cost-based selection (QCBS) method. A transaction \nadvisor engaged under the associated technical assistance (TA) \nwill help recruit the MC for the operation and management of the \nnew  WSS  utilities.  The  proposed  MC  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \nusing the QCBS method, adjusted appropriately. \n   \n ", "vi     \nProject Benefits and  Upon completion, the Project will benefit about 147,000 residential \nBeneficiaries  users, industries, and small businesses in the three towns. About \n50% of the towns\u2019 populations are poor families. Access to safe \nand reliable water supplies and properly operating sewerage and \nwastewater treatment will benefit the poor and non-poor alike, as \nthey are not geographically separated. The social survey found \nthat residents ranked improvements to the WSS systems as high \npriority  to  improve  their  quality  of  life.  Analyses  of  alternative \ntechnical and institutional options were undertaken, and the least-\ncost  development  options  were  identified.  The  overall  project \neconomic internal rate of return is 21.8%, and for each town is: \nAgdash, 25.5%; Goychay, 24.8%; and Nakhchivan, 18.7%. The \nquantitative analysis does not include external benefits related to \nimproved  hygiene  and  health  conditions,  and  environmental \nbenefits from improved sewerage collection and treatment. Under \nall sensitivity tests, the subprojects were economically viable. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  following  project  risks  have  been  identified:  (i)  delay  in \nestablishing the JSCs and liquidating the SuKanals; (ii) ineffective \nautonomy of JSCs; (iii) inability to attract a qualified MC and/or its \ninability to initiate change, train JSCs staff, and perform other \nobligations; (iv) inability to achieve proposed tariff levels; and (v) \nlack of, or inadequate coordination among, government agencies \nand departments. Risks will be mitigated by providing institutional \nand legal support under the associated TA to set up the JSCs, \ndevelop  their  management  structures  and  promote  greater \nautonomy, and through other measures.  \n \nTechnical Assistance  Advisory TA will be provided in association with the Project. The \nTA is estimated to cost $625,000 equivalent; $313,000 is foreign \nexchange cost and $312,000 equivalent is local currency cost. \nADB  will  fund  $500,000  equivalent  on  a  grant  basis  from  the \nJapan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan, \nincluding  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $187,000 \nequivalent  in  local  currency  costs.  The  estimated  13  person- \nmonths  of  international  and  26  person-months  of  domestic \nconsultants\u2019  inputs  will  require  expertise  in  areas  including \ninstitutional  and  corporate  development,  legal  and  regulatory \nframework, training, and management contract transaction. The \nquality-based  selection  (QBS)  method  will  be  used  to  recruit \nconsultants due to the multidisciplinary nature and complexity of \nthe required tasks, and alternative methods and mix of expert \nskills for carrying out the TA. An international consulting firm, in \nassociation  with  domestic  consultants,  will  be  engaged  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, and \nwith  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  selection  of \ndomestic consultants.  \n   \n \n \n \n \n ", " ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation for the proposed loans \nto the Republic of Azerbaijan for the Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Project. The report also \ndescribes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Institutional Strengthening of the Water Supply \nand Sanitation Sector, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  The water supply and sanitation (WSS) sector in Azerbaijan is characterized by institutional \nweaknesses, inefficient operations, outdated and dilapidated physical infrastructure, and severe \nfinancial constraints. As a result, consumers receive a low level and poor quality WSS services. \nUntil recently, the WSS sector consisted of the Greater Baku and the Apsheron peninsular area, \nwhich  was  served  by  the  Joint  Stock  Company  (JSC)  Apsheron  Regional  Water  Company \n(ARWC); and all urban and rural communities outside the Apsheron peninsula, which came under \nthe  overall  responsibility  of  the  Azersukanaltemir  Production  Union  (commonly  known  as \nAzerSuKanal), a department within the State Committee for Construction and Architecture (SCCA). \nThe focus of this Project is on the WSS sector in the secondary towns.1  \n \n3.  In June 2004, Presidential Decree (PD) 252 was issued, titled \u201cOn Improvement of the \nWater Supply Management in the Azerbaijan Republic.\u201d In the part that relates to the proposed \nProject, the PD indicated that (i) the JSC ARWC is to be renamed and reorganized into the JSC \nAzerSu (AzerSu); and (ii) the AzerSuKanal of SCCA is liquidated, and its functions and assets \ntransferred to the AzerSu.2  \n \n4.  Administrative Structure. AzerSuKanal had 51 local branches (water and wastewater \nenterprises, known as SuKanals), responsible for providing WSS services in provincial towns and \nother residential areas. AzerSuKanal\u2019s responsibilities included monitoring and supervision of all \nactivities  of  local  SuKanals,  personnel  management,  evaluation  and  approval  of  investment \ncontracts and budgets, and allocation of budget funds. Despite these extensive responsibilities, \nAzerSuKanal\u2019s capacity to undertake long-term and strategic planning was weak.  \n \n5.  In parallel to reporting to AzerSuKanal, the SuKanals were also responsible to the local \nexecutive authorities (LEA) of their rayons.3  LEA heads are appointed by the President. LEA can \npotentially play a significant role in the monitoring, supervision, and control of the SuKanals, \nbecause they are ultimately responsible for providing local services, including WSS. The tariffs \nwere approved by the Heads of LEA, but were subject to review by the AzerSuKanal and by the \nnational tariff council. Both LEA and AzerSuKanal also reviewed investment budgets. LEA could \nexecute their administrative powers in day-to-day operational decisions of the SuKanals. These \ndual lines of authority caused difficulties and confusion for SuKanal operations. \n \n6.  The rayon offices of other line ministries all interact with the local SuKanals, although this is \nfacilitated  through  the  LEA.  No  institutional  structures  represent  consumers\u2019  interests. \n                                                 \n1  In this report, secondary (or provincial) towns refer to urban settlements with populations of 20,000 to 100,000. \nAzerbaijan has 23 secondary towns, 3 large cities, and about 25 small towns (populations of 5,000 to 20,000). \n2  Other PD actions were to (i) liquidate the Azerkandsutachlizat (water supply in rural areas) of the SCCA and transfer \nall responsibilities and assets of these utilities to AzerSu, and (ii) liquidate the Baku Sewerage Department of the Baku \nExecutive Authority, and transfer all responsibilities and assets to AzerSu. \n3  The country\u2019s main administrative unit. \n ", "2    \nMunicipalities,4 the only elected local bodies in Azerbaijan, were instituted in 2000, and are still too \nweak to significantly impact SuKanals on behalf of the population. \n \n7.  Institutional  Capacity.  The  SuKanals\u2019  institutional  capacity  is  limited.  They  are \npredominantly engineering-focused, with insufficient attention given to maintenance and efficiency \nin operations, planning, financial management, and commercial performance. For SuKanals to \ntransform themselves along the lines of similar organizations in market economies, comprehensive \nreforms  in  the  institutional  structure,  management,  staff  composition  and  skill  mix  would  be \nnecessary.  \n \n8.  Technical State of WSS Assets. The physical WSS assets in many secondary towns are \nold, inappropriately sized, and dilapidated.5 Losses in pipelines and unaccounted-for-water (UFW) \nare difficult to estimate, because there have been no assessments in the past 15 years, and \nengineering drawings of the distribution systems are rare. In the course of the project preparatory \nTA6, estimates were made of total inflows to the Project towns and their actual consumption, which \nshow exceptionally high levels of UFW.7 Twenty two secondary towns have wastewater treatment \nplants, but most are in a deplorable state. Many wastewater treatment works were started during \nthe Soviet time, but were never finished, and provide no real treatment. Wastewater that passes \nthrough the works is discharged into ditches or joins the nearest watercourse. Even in the serviced \ntowns, sewer networks are limited.8 \n \n9.  Level and Quality of WSS Services. The water supply to consumers is intermittent and of \nlimited quantity. The water quality is poor, with high levels of silt. Many consumers buy water from \nprivate vendors to augment their supply. Similarly, sewerage systems are failing, and pipes are \nclogged and broken. During heavy rains raw sewage floods the streets and house compounds, and \nexisting  treatment  facilities  do  not  operate.  River  pollution  increases,  and  stagnant  sewage \nthreatens health conditions. \n  \n10.  Ninety-five percent of respondents indicated poor water quality, i.e., high silt content, as an \noverriding problem in household surveys in project towns carried out under the project preparatory \nTA. Twenty-seven percent of households receive water for only 1 or 2 days a week, and 20% \nreceive water only on alternate days. The surveys suggest that the actual amount used is supply-\nconstrained and ranges from 30 to 45 lpcd. Most private houses and apartments have elevated \ntanks for water storage and for initial settling of the sediment. Little public information is provided to \nconsumers. Many consumers do not know which agency is responsible for WSS services, and \nthere is little consumer involvement in delivery of WSS services. \n \n11.  Financial Aspects of WSS Services. The current financial performance of SuKanals is \npoor. Although SuKanals are self-financing agencies in principle, they are unable to raise finance \ndirectly. For nonroutine repairs, SuKanals relied on additional funds from LEA and AzerSuKanal; \nthose funds were not always forthcoming. It remains to be seen whether AzerSu, which has \nfinancial  difficulties,  can  provide  significant  finance  for  the  SuKanals\u2019  nonroutine  repairs  and \ninvestment,  without  direct  government  funding  support.  Thus,  revenues  are  inadequate  to \nundertake proper operation and maintenance (O&M), and there is no funding for major repairs and \nrehabilitation.  Available  cash  is insufficient  to  cover  O&M  costs  without  deferring  payment  of \n                                                 \n4  There are about 2,700 municipalities in the country.  \n5  In all 51 towns there are 570 pumped borehole sources, 550 surface water pumping stations, 15 water treatment \nworks, and the total length of pipe networks is about 2,300 km. \n6   ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to Azerbaijan for Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Project. Manila. \n7  Estimates range from 75% to 85%, and in some places, total production of water reaches 650 liters per capita per day \n(lpcd). \n8   Fourteen of the 23 secondary towns have networks of less than 10 kilometers (km), and 8 towns have less than 20 km. \n ", "  3\nelectricity bills. This situation has led to the progressive deterioration of WSS systems. Billing and \nrecording of outstanding amounts are outdated and ineffective. Tariffs are low and, because of \npoor service, customers resist paying water bills. \n \nB.  Analysis of Problems and Opportunities \n12.  The  proposed  Project  is  ADB\u2019s  first  intervention  in  Azerbaijan\u2019s  WSS  sector.  Project \npreparation started with an assessment of WSS sectors in secondary towns. The Government \nidentified 15 towns for initial screening and assessment of WSS conditions. Data were collected \nand analyzed, followed by field visits and interviews. The following criteria were used to rank the \ntowns: (i) maximum impact on poverty reduction, (ii) preliminary analysis of investment alternatives \nand their cost effectiveness, (iii) prospects of cost recovery and financial sustainability, (iv) local \ngovernments\u2019 commitment and availability of counterpart funds, and (v) coordination with other \ninternational lending organizations. Based on weighted scores, three towns\u2014Agdash, Goychay, \nand Nakhchivan (project towns)\u2014were selected for further feasibility studies.9  \n \n13.  The WSS sector analysis in the secondary towns, undertaken during the first phase of the \nproject preparatory TA, has benefited from the detailed feasibility studies in the three towns. The \ncompleted WSS sector analysis included recommendations for sector reform in the secondary \ntowns. The undertaken sector analysis highlighted the following key issues: \n  \n(i)  There is insufficient autonomy at the local level to operate, maintain, and manage the WSS \nsystems. The lack of autonomy and dependence on others for vital decisions impede the \nsenses of ownership, initiative, responsibility, and accountability, which are the foundations \nof good utility management. Water and sewerage tariffs are low, and collection of revenues \nis  hampered  by  unwillingness  of  SuKanals  to  discontinue  services  to  non-paying \ncustomers. \n \n(ii) The SuKanals lack appropriate managerial capacity, which is reflected in an overall focus \non production and insufficient attention to maintenance and efficiency. Reliance on planned \nrather than actual data, and on technical and financial norms, makes it difficult for SuKanals \nto  operate  realistically  and  plan  effectively  for  the  future.  All  information  is  manually \nrecorded. Up-to-date and reliable engineering drawings and maps are often not available. \nActual data on operations and network performance is virtually nonexistent.  \n \n(iii) A lack of funding to replace dilapidated WSS assets, rehabilitate the operational assets, \nand maintain routine O&M have led to low productivity of the SuKanals. Furthermore, \nmaintenance  and  rehabilitation  of  many  existing  WSS  systems  is  expensive  and \neconomically  unjustified,  as  they  are  inherited  from  the  Soviet  times  and  are  vastly \noversized.10  The  project  preparatory  TA  estimated  the  replacement  cost  of  the  WSS \ninfrastructure in the secondary towns as about $445 million.11  \n \n14.  Proposed Changes through the Project. The \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d scenario in the WSS \nsector  in  Azerbaijan\u2019s  secondary  towns  is  clearly  unsustainable.  During  project  processing, \n                                                 \n9  Supplementary Appendix 1 gives the towns\u2019 profiles. Agdash and Goychay (populations 26,000 and 36,000) are the \ncenters of the two neighboring rayons in the northern Shirvan region. The two towns are about 40 km apart. \nNakhchivan (population 76,400) is a capital of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic (NAR), an exclave southwest of \nmainland Azerbaijan, bordering with Armenia to the northeast and with Iran to the southwest. Since independence and \na conflict with Armenia, NAR has been under the blockade conditions. \n10  For example, the original installed capacity of the water supply systems in the 13 towns surveyed under the TA is 79 \nmillion cubic meters (m3) per year, but only 24 million m3 was utilized in 2002.  \n11  The WSS Sector Review and Strategy, funded by the World Bank in 2000, estimated that more than $1.5 billion may \nbe required to provide water and basic sanitation services for all of Azerbaijan. \n ", "4    \ndiscussions were carried out with the Government on the findings of the WSS sector analysis in \nsecondary towns, and policy responses. Policy dialogue was extensive on the following issues: (i) \neconomic considerations of investments, and the necessity of designing WSS infrastructure of \noptimal size and capacity; (ii) institutional options to ensure local participation and promotion of \nautonomy in operations; (iii) tariff levels and the importance of financial sustainability of the utilities; \n(iv)  risks  associated  with  immediate  privatization  of  SuKanals  in  the  secondary  towns,  and \nappropriate options for private sector involvement; and (v) viewing the WSS as one sector, and the \nimportance of environmental sustainability.   \n \n15.  The Project design reflects on these policy discussions. The Project will address the key \nsector constraints by focusing on institutional, managerial, and technical areas in the three project \ntowns. The institutional component aims at setting up new WSS utilities in the project towns and \ncreating in them operational and managerial capacity by engaging the services of an experienced \ninternational  operator  on  the  basis  of  a  performance-based  management  contract  (MC).  The \nphysical infrastructure component will provide new optimally sized WSS infrastructure in two towns \nand undertake strategic rehabilitation of the selected facilities in the third town. Detailed description \nof the Project\u2019s objectives and components follows below.  \n   \n16.  Government Policies. The Government recognizes the need for the WSS sector reforms \nand required investments. A National Water Supply and Wastewater Law, passed in 1999, enabled \nrestructuring  of  the  WSS  system.  SuKanals  were  established  under  the  supervision  of \nAzerSuKanal, which was itself set up as a department in the SCCA. In 2000 the Government \nadopted the Water Supply and Sanitation Strategy (footnote 11), which focused mainly on the \nGreater Baku area. It recommended a transformation of WSS utilities in secondary towns into \nfinancially self-sufficient institutions under the control of local governments, which could eventually \nattract the private sector into operation and management.    \n  \n17.  Most Government attention in WSS sector policies has focused on the Greater Baku-\nApsheron area, which benefits from a much bigger consumer base than secondary towns. There, \nprivate sector participation (PSP) is anticipated, and to enable it, a presidential decree was issued \nin March 2002.12 The decree also envisaged measures to improve performance of the sector, \nincluding decentralization of WSS services to local levels. But the decree\u2019s impact has been limited \nin secondary towns, which offer less attractive PSP investment opportunities because of their \nsmaller bases and potential problems of economies of scale. \n \n18.  In  the  recent  adoption  of  the  State  Program  for  Poverty  Reduction  and  Economic \nDevelopment, the Governments stated its intentions to improve the performance of municipal WSS \nsystems. The Government\u2019s recent focus on the development of regional infrastructure, including \nthe WSS, is in line with its general policy to support non-oil development, particularly the utilities \nsector.13 Also, a State Program on Socio-Economic Development of the Regions was recently \nadopted, which includes the proposed Project in the three towns.14  \n \n19.  The Government is establishing a utility regulator, covering electricity, gas, water supply \nand wastewater, and heating. The regulator will be responsible for (i) price, (ii) technical service, \nand (iii) customer service regulation. Adoption of legislation on the utility regulator is expected in \n2006.  \n                                                 \n12  On Strengthening Financial Discipline in the Water Sector, Presidential Decree No. 893, 25 March 2002. \n13  The World Bank\u2019s Second Structural Adjustment Credit to the Republic of Azerbaijan, 2002. \n14  The State Program on Socio-Economic Development of the Regions for 2004\u20132008.

PD 252 (para. 3) changed the management and administration of Azerbaijan\u2019s WSS sector, \nand vested AzerSu with responsibility for all aspects of service delivery in urban and rural areas.15 \nGovernment policies for WSS in secondary towns are evolving. Although the goal of establishing a \nsustainable foundation for a modern utility is widely shared, the institutional and organizational \nmodel for the new WSS utilities in the secondary towns is still developing. There is an opportunity \nto support the reform process through coordinated donor support. The three towns selected under \nthe Project, as well as two towns proposed for support by the Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW) \nand the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affrairs (SECO) (see below), are the first secondary \ntowns selected for improvements in WSS services involving capital investments and institutional \nreforms. The Project is of a pilot nature and will test new approaches for the WSS sector in the \nsecondary towns, and will set the stage for future development intervention in the sector.  \n \n21.  Other Donors. Other international donors involved in the WSS sector include the World \nBank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), KfW, and SECO. The \nWorld Bank, EBRD and SECO have provided assistance to the Greater Baku Water Supply \nRehabilitation  Project  to  support  immediate  improvements  and  institutional  strengthening  of \nARWC. Recent World Bank assistance is provided through a Public-Private Investment Advisory \nFacility  grant  to  support  transaction  advisory  services  for  evaluation  of  PSP  options  for  the \nARWC/AzerSu, and to establish the utility regulator. \n  \n22.  With KfW support, a joint venture between the SuKanal and BerlinWasser International was \nestablished in 2001 in the secondary town of Imishly. A KfW loan, supplemented by a SECO grant, \nis now being prepared for rehabilitation of WSS systems and establishment of new JSCs in the \nlarger secondary towns of Ganja and Sheki. Coordination was close with the KfW-SECO team \nduring project preparation, to ensure consistency in institutional approaches and a coordinated \npolicy approach with the Government. Appendix 1 details donors\u2019 involvement in the WSS sector.  \n \n23.  Lessons Learned. The first ADB loan to Azerbaijan was approved only in December 2003, \nso experience is insufficient to derive lessons from implementation of ADB-funded projects. The \nProject was formulated with careful consideration of experiences of other donors in Azerbaijan, and \nsimilar WSS projects in other countries (Supplementary Appendix 2). The following lessons were \nparticularly  relevant:  (i)  without  institutional  reforms,  the  likelihood  of  success  of  significant \ninvestments in delivering sustainable services to consumers is limited; (ii) when prices of WSS \nservices are raised to reflect their costs, the consumer demand for WSS services responds to the \nprice increases, and experiences of WSS projects in similar areas provided the estimates of such \nprice elasticity of demand; and (iii) to achieve maximum impact from investments, it is important to \nadopt  an  integrated  approach  to  the  rehabilitation  or  replacement  of  water  supply  systems, \nincluding the water source, water treatment if applicable, distribution, and wastewater collection \nand  treatment.  Projects  worldwide  with  MC  participation  suggest  that  for  the  existing  WSS \nconditions  in  small  towns,  PSP  with  equity  investments  by  foreign  private  operators  may  be \nunattractive because of high risk. \n \n24.  The ADB Strategy. The Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s interim operational strategy for \nAzerbaijan, and ADB\u2019s Water-for-All Policy. The current country strategy and program focus on \nfour strategic areas: assistance to internally displaced people; agriculture and rural development; \nsocial infrastructure (particularly water supply, sanitation, and child health); and roads. The Project \n                                                 \n15 The AzerSu charter and corporate structure were being revised during loan preparation. ADB is assisting through a \nstaff consultant to ensure that the new charter of AzerSu is consistent with principles of good corporate governance \nand the project design. \n ", "6    \nalso  supports  the  identified  thematic  priorities,  including  good  governance,  private  sector \ndevelopment, and environmental protection.16  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objective \n25.  The  project  goals  are  to  improve  living  conditions,  raise  public  health  standards,  and \npromote  economic  growth.  The  project  objective  is  to  improve  the  quality,  reliability,  and \nsustainability of WSS services in the towns of Agdash, Goychay, and Nakhchivan. This objective \nwill be achieved through (i) construction of new optimally sized WSS infrastructure and strategic \nrehabilitation of selected facilities; and (ii) establishment of new water utilities as open JSCs, and \ncreating in them operational and managerial capacity by engaging the services of an experienced \ninternational operator on the basis of a performance-based MC. The Project framework is in \nAppendix 2. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n26.  The Project consists of two components: one for physical infrastructure construction and \nrehabilitation, and the other for institutional reform and capacity building.  \n  \n27.  Physical Infrastructure Construction and Rehabilitation. In Agdash and Goychay, the \nProject will develop new well fields with 6 new boreholes, and rehabilitate 2 existing boreholes to \nreplace the current water sources; replace the existing water distribution system with new pipes \n(about 100 km total); and build 6 elevated reservoirs and chlorination facilities. In Nakhchivan, the \nProject will provide new and reliable gravity-fed trunk mains from the infiltration galleries; build 4 \nnew command reservoirs and refurbish 6 existing reservoirs, interconnecting them to create a \nchain at key locations for improved water delivery through gravity flow; and improve key sections of \nthe distribution system. For wastewater, the Project will build a system of waste stabilization ponds \n(WSPs) in all three towns to treat sewage to acceptable levels before discharge to rivers; construct \nabout 120 km of new main and branch sewers; and build 4 sewerage pumping stations. Appendix \n3 gives details of the proposed WSS investments in each town. \n \n28.  Alternative technical options were analyzed during Project preparation, and the proposed \noptions are least-cost in economic terms. For the water source, the development of new borehole \nfields in Agdash and Goychay was compared with a number of options, including reinstatement of \nthe presently destroyed infiltration galleries.17 Hydrogeological analyses of alluvial cones concluded \nthat the proposed well fields have adequate supply of good quality water over the project life. In \nNakhchivan, the existing infiltration galleries represent a good and reliable source compared with \nthe alternative of developing new sources. \n \n29.  The  feasibility  studies  have  shown  that  repair  and  rehabilitation  of  the  existing  WSS \nsystems is not practical in Agdash and Goychay for technical, financial, and economic reasons. \nThe Project will replace dilapidated and inefficient distribution systems in Agdash and Goychay, \nand  upgrade  the  system  in  Nakhchivan.  The  proposed  schemes  will  also  improve  pressure \nmanagement through proper zoning of the distribution system and connections to appropriately \nlocated storage reservoirs in all three towns.  \n                                                 \n16 ADB. 2003. Country Strategy and Program Update (2004-2006): Republic of Azerbaijan. Manila.  \n17 The capital and operating costs of the borehole fields were found to be least-cost when compared with the costs of \nhaving to reinstate and protect the infiltration gallery infrastructures. Important to make the latter option viable and \nsustainable, significant institutional arrangements would need to be put in place for better management of the river \ncatchment. \n ", "  7\n \n30.  The existing sewage treatment works in each town do not function, and raw sewage is \ndischarged into rivers. Alternatives for treating the sewage included (i) conventional biological \ntreatment, (ii) mechanical/physical treatment, and (iii) WSPs. The advantages and disadvantages \nof each system were considered. WSPs were chosen because of the low capital requirements, \nadequate  municipal land  availability,  and  low  operating costs  due  to  limited  requirements  for \nenergy and chemicals. \n \n31.  Institutional  Reform  and  Capacity  Building.  Alternative  institutional  options  were \nexamined to break from the adverse \u201cequilibrium trap\u201d of SuKanals\u2019 poor management, O&M of \nassets, inadequate provision of WSS services, and consumers\u2019 low willingness to pay. Options \nincluded strengthening of the existing SuKanals; corporatization and commercialization of the \nSuKanals;  and  establishment  of  new  JSCs  with  liquidation  of  the  SuKanals.18  Appendix  4 \nsummarizes the risks, advantages, and disadvantages of these alternatives. \n \n32.  The institutional reform and capacity building component will establish a JSC in each \nproject town to provide efficient and financially viable operations. The Agdash and Goychay JSCs \nwill  be  subsidiary  companies  of  AzerSu,  whose  shares  belong  to  the  Ministry  of  Economic \nDevelopment (MED).19 The new status and identity of the utilities will provide a foundation for \nindependence in ownership, operation, and management of the assets. In the future, it will also \nallow parties other than the central government to acquire an interest in, and responsibility for, the \nutility.  \n \n33.  The JSCs will (i) own assets constructed and rehabilitated under the Project, and be \nresponsible for the operation, management, and maintenance of the WSS systems; (ii) have \nappropriate autonomy in financial, managerial, operational, and staffing decisions; and (iii) report to \nAzerSu in Agdash and Goychay, and to SCCA of NAR in Nakhchivan, and be accountable for their \nperformances. To preserve the operational integrity and financial viability of the new JSCs in \nAgdash and Goychay, it is essential that neither old physical assets from the SuKanals, nor any of \ntheir outstanding debts and liabilities, be transferred to the new JSCs.  \n \n34.  Each  JSC  will  have  a  board  of  directors.  The  details  of  the  institutional  and  legal \narrangements for the JSCs, as well as the composition of their boards, will be developed under the \nadvisory TA associated with the Project. To ensure local participation in the WSS services, a \nmeaningful proportion of the board\u2019s voting rights will be assigned to the municipalities. The board \nwill determine policies on supply and delivery of WSS services, staff, capital investments, O&M \nbudgets, customer relations, and tariffs.  \n \n35.  The capacities of the JSCs will be developed through on-the-job training by the MC during \ninitial operational years of the new systems. Upon formation of the JSCs, the SuKanals will be \ndisbanded and liquidated. During the construction period, the JSCs will operate the existing assets, \nwhich will be phased out and decommissioned as the new assets become operational. \n \n36.  The  institutional  model  being  piloted  under  the  Project  and  the  KfW-SECO  project  is \nexpected to serve as a model for the eventual reform of WSS in secondary towns nationwide. The \nproposed model is in line with the government program of reforms in the WSS sector. It results \nfrom extensive discussions on institutional options with various stakeholders, including government \nagencies, local authorities, communities, and international agencies. Appendix 4 gives a detailed \ndescription of the institutional component. \n                                                 \n18 A variation of this option was also considered, with parallel existence/phasing out of the existing SuKanals. \n19 According to Azerbaijan legislation, MED represents the state with regard to state ownership. \n ", "8    \n \nC.  Special Features \n37.  The Project supports the Government\u2019s ongoing efforts  to reform the WSS sector, and will \nhelp shape and direct those reforms. The existing institutional framework in WSS for secondary \ntowns is unsustainable; it should be expected to result in low-quality construction of the proposed \nphysical infrastructure, continued ineffective operation, maintenance, and management of WSS \nassets,  and  thus,  no  significant  improvements  in  WSS  services.  The  Project  will  pilot-test \napproaches for the WSS sector, as a basis for sector-wide reforms in the country\u2019s secondary \ntowns.  \n \n38.  The MC will bring international expertise to the operation, maintenance, and management \nof the new WSS facilities, and train local staff to assume full responsibility for operating the \nsystems. Among several options considered,20 the MC option was chosen as the most appropriate \nway to build capacity of the new JSCs and transfer some initial operating risks to the MC. The \ntransaction adviser under the associated TA will advise and guide on the form, scope, conditions, \nprocurement procedures, duration, performance criteria, and fee structure of the MC.21 The JSCs \nwill appoint the MC, and the transaction adviser and the project management units (PMUs) will \nprovide technical support during recruitment, particularly for preparing terms of reference, short-\nlisting of potential firms, evaluation and ranking of proposals, and negotiating MC with selected \nfirm(s). The MC will provide two key personnel, a chief engineer-operations manager and a finance \nmanager. The MC will become effective about 1 year before the physical construction work is \ncompleted, to enable them to become familiar with the WSS systems as they are constructed; \nselect counterpart staff; and set up the operational, administrative, and financial management \nsystems for the JSCs. The JSCs, the Government, and ADB will review future arrangements during \nthe last year of the contract. \n  \n39.  The second innovative feature of the Project relates to promotion of local participation and \nconsumer interest in WSS services. The Project will have municipalities represented on the boards \nof the JSCs, and will establish town water users\u2019 associations (TWUAs). A fixed share of the \nboards\u2019 voting rights will be assigned to the representatives of municipalities, to ensure local \nparticipation in the WSS services. TWUAs will be formed in two project towns as advocacy groups \nto represent consumer interests. The JSCs will recognize the TWUAs as important partners in \nensuring that WSS services satisfy the consumers. ADB will provide grant support for this pilot and \ndemonstration activity (PDA), which will strengthen local partnership for managing WSS services \n(Supplementary Appendix 8).22  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n40.  The total project cost is estimated at $39.9 million equivalent, comprising $20.7 million \nequivalent in foreign exchange cost (52%) and $19.2 million equivalent (48%) in local currency \ncost. Taxes and duties, included in the cost, are estimated at $4.9 million equivalent. The cost \nestimates are summarized in Table 1, and detailed in Appendix 5. \n \n                                                 \n20 These are described in Supplementary Appendix 7.  \n21  The MC remuneration will comprise a fixed fee and a performance-based element. The loan will cover fixed fees \nduring the 4 years (a full 3 years of operation, and intermittent inputs during the year of construction of the WSS \nassets).

Financing Plan \n41.  ADB  will  provide  a  blend  of  two  loans.  A  loan  of  $20.0  million  equivalent  in  various \ncurrencies  expressed  in  Special  Drawing  Rights  from  the  Special  Fund  resources  (Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF loan)) will finance 50% of the total cost of the Project. It will have a \nmaturity of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest charge of 1% per year during \nthe grace period and 1.5% thereafter, and such terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan and \nProject Agreements. A loan of $10.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR loan) will \nfinance 25% of the project cost. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 6 \nyears,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. The Borrower for the two loans will be the \nRepublic of Azerbaijan. Both loans will finance the entire foreign exchange costs of the Project \n($20.7 million, or 52% of the total project cost), and about $9.3 million equivalent of the local \ncurrency costs (or 23% of the total project cost). Most of ADB\u2019s local cost financing is for project \nmanagement and capacity building to achieve the institutional strengthening objective, and for civil \nworks, including local labor and construction materials.  \n \n42.  Part of the ADF loan ($8.0 million equivalent) will be re-lent from the Government to \nAzerSu, which in turn will on-lend it to the Agdash and Goychay JSCs (in the amounts of $3.8 \nmillion and $4.2 million equivalent, respectively). A portion of the OCR loan equivalent to $9.3 \nmillion will be re-lent from the Government to the Nakhchivan JSC. All subsidiary loans and \nsubloans will have identical terms,23 will be in Azerbaijan manats, and their terms and conditions \nwill be defined in subsidiary and subloan agreements satisfactory to ADB. The Government will \nbear the interest and foreign exchange risks, which will be reflected in the relending and onlending \nterms. The JSCs will repay these subloans through collection of user charges. The grant portion in \n                                                 \n23 A 25-year amortization period, including a 6-year grace period, and interest rate of 2.5% per annum. \n ", "10    \nthe amount of $11.6 million equivalent will be transferred through budgetary appropriations to the \nEAs and further to the Agdash, Goychay, and Nakhchivan JSCs (in the amounts equivalent to $6.5 \nmillion, $2.8 million, and $2.3 million, respectively).  \n \n43.  The Government will finance the remaining local currency cost, estimated at $9.9 million \nequivalent,  for  incremental  project  staff,  taxes  and  duties,  and  partly  for  construction  costs. \nCounterpart funds will be channeled to the PMUs and PIUs through regular budgetary allocations, \nexemptions  from  taxes  and  duties,  and  small  contributions  in  kind.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n44.  An  interagency  project  steering  committee  (SC)  will  be  established  to  provide  policy \nguidance  and  direction  for  project  implementation.  This  will  include  recommendations  for \ninstitutional, legislative, and regulatory reforms for the secondary towns\u2019 WSS sectors, and steering \nthe proposed reforms through the government bureaucracy. The SC will facilitate interagency \ncooperation and coordination to ensure that the Project is implemented timely, efficiently, and in a \ncost-effective manner. The SC will be established when the loan becomes effective, and will be \nchaired by a high-level official from the Cabinet of Ministers. The SC will comprise representatives \nof MED, Ministry of Finance, AzerSu, and SCCA of NAR. The SC will convene at least twice a year \nduring project implementation. \n \n45.  There will be two executing agencies (EAs) for the Project. AzerSu will be the EA for the \nAgdash  and  Goychay  subprojects,  and  SCCA  for  NAR  will  be  the  EA  for  the  Nakhchivan \nsubproject. Both EAs will assign senior officials as project directors. The functions, duties, and \nresponsibilities of the EAs are to (i) serve as focal points for the project and coordinate among the \nimplementing  agencies  and  other  concerned  ministries  and  agencies;  and  (ii)  establish  and \noperate PMUs. The EAs will be responsible for establishment and supervision of the JSCs, and \nclosure and liquidation of the existing WSS operators (SuKanals). The EAs will phase out and \ndecommission the old facilities when new systems come into service.   \n \n46.  Qualified and experienced project managers, satisfactory to ADB, will head the two PMUs. \nThe PMUs will be staffed with a complement of professional and technical personnel. The PMUs\u2019 \nresponsibilities  will  include  (i)  general  project  management  and  the  supervision  of  detailed \nengineering  design,  procurement,  construction  supervision;  (ii)  assistance  to  the  JSCs  in  the \nselection and appointment of MC; and (iii) commissioning of the completed facilities and handover \nto the JSCs for operation. The PMUs will also be responsible for maintaining project accounts and \nrecords, preparation of quarterly progress reports, and a final project completion report.  \n \n ", " 11\n47.  During project implementation the JSCs will be implementing agencies, and will form the \nlocal project implementation units (PIUs). The PIUs will be staffed with construction supervision \npersonnel assigned from the design and supervision contract managed by the PMUs. In Agdash \nand Goychay, the PIUs will also be responsible for operating the existing WSS services during \nconstruction. Selected operational staff from the former SuKanals will be retained for that purpose. \nUpon completion of the construction of the new WSS systems, the PIUs will hand over the WSS \nfacilities to JSCs\u2019 operations units. The PIUs will be disbanded when construction is completed. \nAppendix 6 describes the proposed framework for project implementation and management, and \nthe subsequent operation of completed facilities. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n48.  The Project will be implemented over 6 years, covering the period of establishment of the \nJSCs, construction of the WSS systems, engagement of an MC, and operation of the systems \nunder the MC. Appendix 7 gives the detailed project implementation schedule. \n \n3.  Procurement \n49.  Goods and services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \nCivil works estimated to cost $1.0 million equivalent or more, and equipment and materials that \ncost $500,000 or more, will be procured using international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures. \nCivil works valued at less than $1.0 million equivalent will be procured using local competitive \nbidding  (LCB)  procedures  in  accordance  with  government  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB. \nEquipment and materials packages valued under $500,000 will be procured through international \nshopping (IS) procedures. General procurement notices for contracts to be awarded through ICB \nwill be submitted to ADB within 90 days before the issuance of the first prequalification invitation or \nthe first invitation to bid for the project. Appendix 8 provides an indicative list of major procurement \npackages. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n50.  The Government will select and engage an international consulting firm in association with \ndomestic consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The consulting firm \nwill assist the EAs and the PMUs in project implementation and management, preparation of \ndetailed design, procurement and contracting, construction supervision, finance and accounting, \nand social and poverty assessments. The international consulting firm will be recruited using ADB\u2019s \nQuality and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) method. A transaction adviser engaged under the \nassociated TA will assist with recruitment of the MC for the operation and management of the new \nWSS utilities. The proposed MC will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants, using the QCBS method with appropriate adjustments. \n \n51.  The Project will provide about 68 person-months of international and 570 person-months of \ndomestic consulting services to support project implementation, including detailed design and \nsupervision.  Consulting  services  will  cover  (i)  project  management,  (ii)  WSS  engineering, (iii) \ndetailed  engineering  design  and  construction  supervision,  (iv)  financial  management  and \naccounting, (v) a WSP specialist, (vi) a procurement specialist-contract engineer, and (vii) a social \nspecialist. Appendix 9 gives the outline terms of reference for consulting services.  \n \n ", "12    \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements  \n52.  The ADB loan funds will be disbursed in accordance with the procedures set out in ADB\u2019s \nLoan  Disbursement  Handbook  (January  2001).  The  PMUs  and  PIUs  will  be  responsible  for \npreparing disbursement projections, requesting budgetary allocations for the counterpart funds, \npreparing withdrawal applications and sending them to ADB. To expedite project implementation \nthrough timely release of loan proceeds, the EAs will establish imprest accounts promptly after \nloan effectiveness, with an initial deposit of $150,000 equivalent for each from the loan proceeds. \nThe imprest accounts will be established at commercial banks acceptable to ADB, and will be \nmanaged and liquidated according to detailed arrangements agreed upon by the Government and \nADB, and consistent with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The ceiling of any imprest account \nshould not exceed 6 months of estimated expenditures, or 10% of the loans\u2019 amount, whichever is \nlower. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedure will be used to reimburse expenditures and \nliquidate the imprest account for payments, not exceeding $50,000 equivalent per payment. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n53.  AzerSu and SCCA of  NAR  will submit quarterly and annual progress reports to ADB \nindicating progress made and problems encountered during the review period, steps taken or \nproposed to remedy the problems, the proposed program of activities, and the expected progress \nduring the following period. Within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, the EAs will \nsubmit to ADB a project completion report providing details about implementation, costs, benefits, \nand other information that ADB may request.  \n \n54.  AzerSu and SCCA of NAR will maintain separate accounts and financial statements for the \nProject, which independent auditors, acceptable to ADB, will audit annually. The annual audit \nreports will include an opinion on the use of the loan proceeds and compliance with the financial \ncovenants, included in the loan and project agreements, including the use of the imprest accounts \nand statement of expenditures procedures. The AzerSu and SCCA of NAR will provide ADB with \naudit reports in English, together with audited accounts and financial statements, no later than 6 \nmonths after the end of each fiscal year. \n \n55.  The Government was informed of ADB\u2019s policy on submission of audited accounts, which \ncovers failure to submit audited accounts and financial statements by due dates. If submission of a \nfinancial statement is delayed more than 6 months: (i) no commitment letter will be issued, if \napplicable, and (ii) ADB might not approve new contact awards. If the delay is more than 12 \nmonths, loan disbursements may be suspended or the loans may be canceled.   \n \n7.  Project Performance Management System \n56.  At the beginning of the Project, PMUs, PIUs, loan consultants, and the transaction adviser \nunder the associated TA will develop comprehensive project performance management system \n(PPMS) procedures, acceptable to ADB, to systematically generate relevant data and agreed \nsocioeconomic and environmental indicators to measure project impacts. This system of indicators \nwill also provide a basis for indicators to be prepared for the performance-based MC with the JSCs. \n \n8.  Project Review \n57.  The  Government  and  ADB  will  jointly  review  the  Project  twice  yearly  throughout \nimplementation. Initial reviews may be more frequent, to ensure the timely start of Project activities. \nThe reviews will cover institutional arrangements, design quality, construction standards, scope, \nMC recruitment and performance, overall implementation, and status of compliance with loan \n ", " 13\ncovenants. A comprehensive mid-term review will be carried out at the end of the third year. \nFeedback from PPMS activities will be analyzed and addressed during review missions. \n \n9.  Governance and Anti-Corruption  \n58.  During project processing, ADB\u2019s anti-corruption policy was explained to the Government \nofficials. Attention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n59.  To support the broader institutional reforms piloted under the Project, ADB will provide TA \nto help the Government create and build the capacity of new urban WSS service providers and \nmanagement institutions. The TA objective is to develop new WSS utility managers and operators \nwithin the context of an effective legal, regulatory, administrative, and institutional framework. The \nTA  scope  will  include  providing  advice,  guidance,  and  assistance  to  the  Government  on  (i) \nestablishment of JSCs, development of their corporate structures based on the principles of good \ncorporate governance, and training of JSC board members and staff; (ii) the legal and institutional \nframework, human resources management strategy, and financial and accounting measures for \nthe closure and liquidation of the existing SuKanals; (iii) transaction advisory services for the MC to \nbe engaged to run the JSCs in the early years, including measurable performance criteria and an \nincentives-based remuneration structure; and (iv) a public awareness and education campaign on \nWSS tariffs increases and water conservation. \n  \n60.  The  estimated  13  person-months  of  international  and  26  person-months  of  domestic \nconsultants\u2019 inputs will require expertise in areas including institutional and corporate development, \nlegal and regulatory framework, training, and MC transaction. The Quality Based Selection (QBS) \nmethod  will  be  used  for  recruitment  of  consultants,  due  to  the  multidisciplinary  nature  and \ncomplexity of the required tasks, and alternative methods and mix of expert skills for carrying out \nthe TA. An international consulting firm in association with domestic consultants will be engaged in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, and other arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB for selection of domestic consultants. AzerSu and SCCA of NAR will be the EAs for the TA, \nand will maintain close coordination with MED to ensure that the TA findings, recommendations, \nand outputs are applied effectively to the creation and development of the WSS institutions and \nimplementation of the project. The TA will be implemented over 18 months period. \n \n61.  The TA is estimated to cost $625,000 equivalent; $313,000 is the foreign exchange cost \nand $312,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. ADB will fund $500,000 equivalent on a grant \nbasis, including the entire foreign exchange cost and $187,000 equivalent of local currency cost. \nThe TA grant will be funded by the Japan Special Fund, financed by the Government of Japan. \nThe Government will finance the remaining $125,000 equivalent of local costs. Appendix 10 gives \nthe detailed TA description and outline terms of reference. The TA first appeared in ADB Business \nOpportunities on 27 May 2004.            \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n62.  Economic Aspects. Urban WSS services in the project towns are inadequate. Assets have \ndeteriorated and a lack of maintenance has severely affected service delivery. Without major \ninvestments in the near future the WSS systems will continue to deteriorate rapidly, with serious \nconsequences for economic activity, livelihood, hygiene, and health. The water supply systems in \nAgdash and Goychay are approaching total collapse. All three project towns ration water, with \nmany residents (ranging between 22% to 54%) having to use alternative water sources for their \n ", "14    \nmain water supply. The social survey found that residents ranked improvements in the WSS \nsystems as a high priority to improve quality of their lives. Upon completion, the Project will benefit \nabout 147,000 residential users, industries, and small businesses in the three towns. Access to a \nsafe  and  reliable  water  supply  and  properly  operating  sewerage  and  wastewater  treatment \nsystems will benefit the poor and non-poor alike, as they are not geographically separated, and all \nhouseholds will have access to the improved system.  \n \n63.  The WSS component will (i) provide safe and reliable drinking water, including to extended \nservice areas; (ii) generate major efficiency gains by providing systems that are more properly \nsized to demand requirements, will reduce system losses, and will reduce staff and maintenance \ncosts; (iii) improve cost recovery through better customer satisfaction; (iv) improve the health and \nwell-being of the people in three secondary towns through reduced water-related diseases and \nbetter hygiene; (v) reduce the cost of, and time spent on, water collection, storage, boiling, and \nother treatment, particularly for women; and (vi) support economic recovery and growth. UFW will \nbe reduced in Agdash and Goychay from the currently estimated 70% to 25% with the major \nreplacement of the water supply transmission and distribution systems, and in Nakhchivan to about \n50% through leak detection and improved management of the distribution system. \n \n64.  An  analysis  of  alternative  water  sources  was  undertaken  and  least-cost  development \noptions were identified. In Agdash and Goychay the development of new borehole fields for each \ntown  was  compared  with  other  options,  including  reinstatement  of  the  present  washed-out \ninfiltration galleries. The capital and operating costs of the borehole fields were found to be least \ncost when compared with capital costs of having to reinstate and protect the infiltration gallery \ninfrastructures. Also, to make this option viable, additional institutional arrangements would be \nnecessary to better manage the river catchment. For Nakhchivan, the existing infiltration galleries \nrepresent a good and reliable source compared with the alternative of developing new sources. \nThe sewage treatment works in each town do not function, and raw sewage is discharged into \nrivers. Advantages and disadvantages of alternative options for treating sewage were considered. \nWSPs were chosen because of the low capital requirements, available municipal land, and low \noperating costs with low energy and chemical requirements.  \n \n65.  A forecast of demand for WSS services was undertaken, based on least-cost options and \ncorresponding optimal tariffs. The demand estimates were used to determine the optimal design \ncapacity of the WSS systems and the justified scale of investment. The economic internal rate of \nreturn (EIRR) was calculated in constant 2004 prices using the domestic price numeraire, since \nproject outputs are non-tradables. Costs include capital costs in line with the implementation \nschedule, and operating and replacement costs. Financial costs, excluding taxes and duties, are \nconverted to economic costs by applying a shadow exchange rate factor and a shadow wage rate \nfactor for unskilled labor. Nonincremental economic benefits include considerations of (i) purchase \nof tankered water; (ii) use of boreholes; (iii) time savings for water collection; (iv) costs of water \nstorage, disinfecting, and pumping; and (v) water boiling and filtering costs.  \n \n66.  The overall project EIRR is 21.8%. The EIRR for Agdash is 25.5%; for Goychay, 24.8%; \nand for Nakhchivan, 18.7%. Thus the EIRR for the three towns exceeds the economic opportunity \ncost of capital, which is assumed to be 12%. The calculations do not include external benefits \nrelated  to  improved  hygiene  and  health,  and  environmental  benefits  from  improved  sewage \ncollection  and  treatment.  Accordingly,  the  assessment  of  benefits  should  be  treated  as \nconservative. Sensitivity tests were undertaken to consider the impact of risks, encompassed in \nadverse cost and benefit scenarios. Sensitivity indicators and switching values were calculated for \nthe standard sensitivity tests. Under all sensitivity tests, the subprojects were found economically \nviable. Appendix 11 summarizes the economic analyses. \n \n ", " 15\n67.  Tariffs  and  Affordability.  The  following  objectives  were  taken  into  account  when \nconsidering water and wastewater tariffs and their structures: (i) financial sustainability and full cost \nrecovery, (ii) economic efficiency and marginal costs, (iii) price equity, (iv) administrative efficiency \nand good governance, and (iv) affordability and universal access.24  \n \n68.  In developing tariffs and financial objectives for the new JSCs, special emphasis was given \nto ensuring long-term financial sustainability of services, while simultaneously ensuring that tariffs \nare affordable, especially for low-income and at-risk households. On the basis of discussions with \nthe local and central governments and project household surveys, the basic WSS needs in the \nsecondary towns were defined as 45 lpcd. Tariffs are regarded as affordable where the payments \nfor the WSS services do not exceed 5% of household income. Based on estimates of such tariffs, \nthe JSCs are able to meet the O&M costs and to repay a major portion of the ADB loans allocated \nfor the water supply component. \n  \n69.  Current water tariffs are low and customer resistance to paying water bills is high because \nof  poor  services.  After  project  commissioning  and  provision  of  24-hour  supply,  tariffs  will  be \nincreased by two or three times in 2008, and then raised another 50% in two steps by 2012. \nAfterward, tariffs will be maintained in real terms, adjusting for inflation. The analysis described in \nAppendix 12 shows the tariff levels proposed for each project town and demonstrates that they are \naffordable. The proposed average household charges were compared with average household \nincome in 2012. The results are 4.8% in Agdash, 4.6% in Goychay, and 3.5% in Nakhchivan. For \nlow-income residents, proposed charges for basic needs of 45 lpcd are 4.2% in Agdash, 3.0% in \nGoychay, and 2.3% in Nakhchivan. Furthermore, the combined monthly charges for water and \nwastewater are far less than the estimated coping costs of households required to obtain their \nmonthly water supplies (involving purchase of water, fetching, storing, pumping, and boiling and \nfiltering). To address the social implications of the increased WSS tariffs, a public awareness and \neducation campaign will be undertaken through the MC activities, associated TA, and the grant \nassistance to the TWUAs through PDA. \n \n70.  Financial Analysis. Financial projections were prepared for each new JSC, assuming  that \nthe  new  entities  will  take  over  operation  of  existing  systems  during  the  construction  phase. \nFinancial projections, including operating and financial ratios, have been prepared in nominal \nterms. Estimates of O&M costs consider improvements in efficiency from optimally sized systems \ncompared with the existing systems, which were oversized. Financial projections also assume \nimproved cash flow management, including higher collection rates, which should be achieved \nthrough MC activities. After 2008, the JSCs are expected to meet cash flow requirements and after \n2012, to meet full debt service obligations and maintain a minimum debt service ratio of 1.2. \nAppendix 13 summarizes financial analysis.  \n \n71.  A financial evaluation, in real terms using constant 2004 prices, was completed for each \nsubproject. The project cost estimates and financial projections in nominal terms were converted to \nreal  terms  by  adjusting  for  the  likely  effects  of  foreign  and  domestic  inflation  and  currency \nfluctuation. Incremental costs and benefits were derived by evaluating the financial positions of the \nJSCs under \u201cwith project\u201d and \u201cwithout project\u201d scenarios. The average financial internal rate of \nreturn (FIRR) is 4.4%. This compares favorably with the weighted average cost of capital of 1.3%. \nThe Project is considered both financially viable and sustainable. Sensitivity and risk analyses \nindicate that the FIRR for each subproject and the project overall are robust under most conditions. \n \n72.  Institutional  Aspects.  The  JSCs  in  the  project  towns  will  be  run  as  professionally \nmanaged,  technically  sound,  and  financially  viable  businesses.  Increased  local  ownership, \n                                                 \n24  ADB. 2003. Economics and Research Department Technical Note Series, Numbers 9 and 10. Manila. \n ", "16    \nrepresentation of customer interests, and best management practices to be brought by the MC, will \nimprove corporate governance of WSS utilities. The Project will pilot institutional reform and serve \nas a basis for possible replication of this institutional model in other secondary towns. \n \n73.  Social and Poverty Reduction Aspects. Despite some progress in recent years, about \n50% of Azerbaijan\u2019s population of 8 million lived below the national poverty line in 2001; 17%, or \n1.3 million, in extreme poverty.25 The 2001 household budget survey shows that poverty incidence \nis greatest in urban households. Within the urban category, poverty is highest in secondary towns, \nand regional variations in poverty rates are significant. The Project will provide better access to \nwater and sanitation to about 147,000 people by 2010. Currently, about 50% of the project towns\u2019 \npopulations are poor families. The Project is classified as a poverty intervention project, based on \nthe proportion of poor among the beneficiaries, the proportion of benefits accruing to the poor, and \nthe positive impact it will have on other poverty reduction projects in these areas. The poverty \nimpact ratio is estimated to be 0.64. The major project benefits are savings and incremental \nbenefits accruing to water consumers, and to the economy from improved WSS services. By late \n2010, the coverage of consumers in project areas for clean water will increase from 55% to 80%, \nand sewerage, from 43% to 77%. Appendix 14 gives the summary poverty reduction and social \nstrategy. \n \n74.  The Project will install trunk mains and distribution networks, and will require land for \nWSPs. All project activities will take place within the existing pipeline alignment or right-of-way, and \non land owned by municipal governments. The location and design of works associated with the \nProject have been carefully considered to avoid land acquisition and resettlement. No existing \nhousing,  structures,  shops,  or  productive  land  will  be  affected,  according  to  the  surveys, \ndiscussions with officials and communities in the project areas, and inventory location for WSPs, \nboreholes, and wastewater and water distribution systems. The Project, therefore, does not require \nland acquisition and resettlement. The Project will not adversely affect any indigenous people or \nethnic minority. \n \n75.  Environmental Measures. The Project will improve the quality, reliability, and sustainability \nof WSS in three secondary towns of Agdash, Goychay, and Nakhchivan. The Project will provide \nconservation of water resources and environmental benefits by reducing the areas of towns with \nstagnant water from overflowing sewers. The Project is categorized as \u201cB\u201d in accordance with the \nADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003).  All  subcomponents  aim  to  improve  the \nquality and security of water supply, sanitation, and wastewater disposal. Initial environmental \nexamination  (IEE)  was  carried  out  for  all  subprojects  and  shows  no  significant  adverse \nenvironmental impact. The IEE was approved by the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources of \nAzerbaijan. Supplementary Appendix 10 summarizes the IEE. \n \n76.  Sustainability. The Project\u2019s sustainability after implementation depends on the following \nfactors: (i) effective transfer of the operational and managerial know-how from the MC to the \noperational and management staff of the JSCs; (ii) adequate O&M of the WSS assets to ensure \nsustained quality and quantity levels of WSS services and thus adequate collection rates; and (iii) \neffective autonomy of the JSCs and their capacity to fully recover costs. Before project completion, \nthe  MC  arrangements  will  be  reviewed  and  a  specific  plan  will  be  prepared  for  further \narrangements, incorporating lessons learned during project implementation. \n  \n                                                 \n25 The poverty line is based on the cost of a food consumption basket, which guarantees a daily intake of 2,200 \nkilocalorie, or a per capita income AZM120,000 ($25.8) per month.  The extreme poverty line is set at 60% of the \nmedian per capita consumption expenditure level per month, which was AZM72,000 ($15.5) in 2001. \n ", " 17\n77.  Project  Risks.  The  following  risks  related  to  the  institutional  component  have  been \nidentified: (i) delay in establishing the JSCs and liquidating the SuKanals; (ii) ineffective autonomy \nof JSCs; and (iii) inability to attract a qualified MC and/or its inability to initiate change, train JSCs \nstaff, and perform other obligations. Assistance under the associated TA will provide institutional \nand legal support to set up the JSCs, and to develop their management structures in accordance \nwith the principles of good corporate governance and financial management. Operational JSCs is a \ncondition  for  loan  disbursement.  The  form  of  a  performance-based  MC  and  its  proposed \nremuneration structure will minimize risks for potential international operators. Clear performance \nindicators for the MC, and measures to ensure their effectiveness, will be developed, and future \narrangements  will  be  reviewed  prior  to  expiration  of  the  contract.  ADB  will  monitor  project \nimplementation, including activities of the JSCs and MC performance, and will maintain close \ndialogue with the Government on the institutional arrangements for the WSS sector. \n \n78.  During the construction phase, there is a potential risk related to phasing in of the new WSS \nfacilities and phasing out of the old assets, while minimizing disruption to the existing services in \nthe  project  towns.  A  detailed  engineering  design  will  include  plans  to  commission  new,  and \ndecommission old, assets. By the time the construction starts, the SuKanals will be liquidated, and \nthe transition period will be overseen by a single management structure (the PIUs in the JSCs). \n \n79.  Other  project  risks  relate  to  (i)  delayed  project  implementation  because  of  delays  in \nfinalizing  a  charter  of  AzerSu  acceptable  to  ADB;  (ii)  delayed  project  implementation  due  to \ninsufficient institutional capacity, knowledge, and experience in implementing ADB-funded projects; \n(iii) inability of the JSCs to achieve the proposed tariff levels; and (iv) lack of, or inadequate, \ncoordination between government agencies and departments. ADB has provided advisory support \nto help finalize AzerSu\u2019s charter acceptable to ADB, and will provide training of PMU/PIU staff on \nADB policies and procedures. Close monitoring of compliance with financial covenants and prompt \naction in case of noncompliance during project implementation will be important; so will be the \ncareful selection of PMU/PIU consultants and the training of government officials. The project SC \nwill provide a forum to discuss different views and to achieve consensus. ADB will liaise with senior \ngovernment officials during project implementation.  \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n80.  In addition to the standard assurances, the following assurances were discussed with the \nGovernment and AzerSu: \n  \n(i)  Establishment of JSCs. The Government will ensure the timely establishment of \nJSCs  and  liquidation  of  the  SuKanals  in  the  three  project  towns,  and  that  the \nassociated  TA  recommendations  regarding  details  of  the  institutional  and  legal \narrangements for the JSCs will be considered. No material organizational changes \n(financial,  operational,  or  structural)  in,  nor  material  asset  transfers  to  or  from, \nAzerSu or JSCs, including changes in ownership of JSCs and project facilities, will \nbe  formally  approved  or  implemented  without  ADB\u2019s  prior  concurrence,  if  such \nchanges would affect AzerSu\u2019s or JSCs\u2019 ability to perform obligations under the \nproject agreement, subsidiary loan agreements, or subloan agreements. \n  \n(ii)  Assets and debts of SuKanals. The Government and AzerSu will ensure that old \nphysical assets, and outstanding debts and liabilities of the SuKanals, will not be \ntransferred  to  the  new  JSCs  in  Agdash  and  Goychay.  No  payments  (including \ndividends) will be allowed from JSCs to AzerSu, except for services provided.  \n ", "18    \n \n(iii)  Corporate  development  plans.   AzerSu  will  develop,  and  cause  the  JSCs  to \ndevelop and provide to ADB, no later than 1 February of each year starting from the \nsecond  year  of  project  implementation,  annual  corporate  development  plans \nconsisting of revenue and expenditure budgets, tariff reviews, covenant compliance, \nand  detailed  O&M  plans.  The  Nakhchivan  JSC  will  submit  a  similar  corporate \ndevelopment plan to ADB no later than 1 February of each year starting from the \nsecond year of project implementation.  \n \n(iv)  Recruitment  and  performance  of  a  MC.  The  Government  will  ensure  timely \nrecruitment of an international MC. The MC will become effective not later than 1 \nyear before the construction works are completed. Adequate conditions shall be \nmaintained for effective performance of the MC throughout the life of the agreed \ncontract. \n \n(v)  JSCs' personnel. The Government will ensure that the MC can recruit suitable staff \nfor operation and management of the WSS facilities constructed and rehabilitated \nunder the Project. \n \n(vi)  Counterpart  funding.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  adequate  budgetary \nallocations of required counterpart funding will be made available for the Project on \na timely basis for each year during implementation. By 30 November of each year of \nproject implementation, the PMUs will prepare and submit to the Government an \noperational plan for the next year, indicating requirements for counterpart financing. \n \n(vii)  PMUs  and  PIUs  staff.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  PMUs  and  PIUs  are \nadequately  staffed  at  all  times  during  project  implementation  with  competent \nprofessional and support staff. \n \n(viii)  Tariff levels and financial objectives. The Government will review, annually, water \nand sewerage tariffs to ensure they are set according to project financing needs to \nachieve a debt service ratio of 1.0 in the project towns\u2019 JSCs from 2008, and 1.2 \nafter 2012, subject to compliance with applicable laws and regulations. No entity, \nwhether a government agency, institution, or enterprise, regardless of ownership, \nwill be exempted from the water and sewerage tariffs established pursuant to the \nabove, or granted a preferential rate other than within the approved tariff structure, \nor excused for delays in payments without penalties. The impact of increased WSS \ntariffs on the poor will be reviewed, and appropriate measures will be introduced to \nprotect the basic living standards of the urban poor. Summaries of these reviews will \nbe furnished to ADB. \n \n(ix)  Land acquisition. The Government will ensure and cause AzerSu to ensure that \nthe construction of WSS services will be on the existing right-of-way or on state-\nowned land. The Project will not entail land acquisition from private ownership, and \nno persons will be adversely affected in terms of ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement \nPolicy (1995). In the event of unforeseen land acquisition from private ownership \nand/or  resettlement,  the  Government  and/or  AzerSu  will  prepare  and  have \nnecessary  planning  documents  approved  by  ADB  before  award  of  civil  works \ncontracts,  and  implement  any  such  resettlement  measures  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). \n \n ", " 19\n(x)  Environment. The Government will ensure and cause to be ensured that (a) the \nProject is implemented in accordance with existing environmental laws, regulations, \nand  standards  of  Azerbaijan,  and  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Policy  (2002)  and \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003),  as  amended  periodically;  (b)  all \nmonitoring and mitigation measures indicated in the IEE/SIEE are undertaken; and \n(c)  project  implementation  will  include  consultations  with  local  communities  on \nenvironmental issues, and access to environmental information pertaining to the \nProject will be ensured. \n \n(xi)  Management of water resources. The Government and AzerSu will ensure proper \nmanagement  of  water  resources  near  the  project  towns,  to  maintain  adequate \nrecharge to the aquifers from which town water is drawn. The Government will \nensure effective implementation of legislation with respect to protection of water \nresources, river courses, and drainage systems. \n \n(xii)  Town water users\u2019 associations. The Government will facilitate the establishment \nof TWUAs in Agdash and Goychay.  \n \n(xiii)  Accounting standards. The Government will ensure that all necessary measures \nare  taken  to  maintain  the  books  of  accounts  in  accordance  with  Azerbaijan \naccounting standards, and to present annual project accounts and related financial \nstatements in accordance with international accounting standards. \n \n(xiv)  Audit. The Government will ensure that an independent auditor with qualifications, \nexpertise, and terms of reference acceptable to ADB, will audit the project accounts \nand financial statements of AzerSu and the three JSCs in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nHandbook on Financial Management and Governance, and sound audit standards \nthat are acceptable to ADB. The Government will ensure that the auditor is selected \nand hired in accordance with competitive selection procedures acceptable to ADB. \n \n(xv)  Project performance management system. The PMUs and the three PIUs will put \nin  place  PPMS  indicators,  including  baseline  data,  within  6  months  of  loan \neffectiveness, and will submit annual PPMS reports to ADB. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n81.  Prior to effectiveness of both loans, the Government will have a subsidiary loan agreement, \nin a form and substance satisfactory to ADB, concluded between the Ministry of Finance and \nAzerSu, and make it effective.  \n \nC.

This appendix \nsummarizes  the  proposed  water  supply  and  sanitation  (WSS)  investments  in  each  town. \nSupplementary Appendix 4 gives a detailed description of the physical infrastructure component.  \n \n2.  Agdash. The proposed project will benefit the population of about 28,000 residents by \n2010. Water connections will increase from the current level of 66% to 95%, and sewerage \ncoverage, from 66% to 90%. In particular, the Project will: \n(i)  Develop a new well field located on the Golgati road with 3 new boreholes to \nreplace the current water sources consisting of the nonfunctioning town boreholes \nand the infiltration galleries destroyed by frequent and severe river flooding. This \nsubcomponent will improve the quality of the drinking water source.  \n(ii)  Replace the existing water distribution system with 56 km of new pipes, and replace \n3 elevated reservoirs and a chlorination facility. New connections will be provided to \nhouseholds and industry, and metering of water will be introduced. \n(iii)  Construct 48 km of new main and branch sewers, 2 sewerage pumping stations, \nand a system of waste stabilization ponds (WSPs) to treat sewage. Two pumping \nstations are required because of Agdash\u2019s specific topographic conditions. \n \n3.  Goychay. The proposed project will benefit the population of about 39,000 residents by \n2010. The number of water connections will increase from the current 71% to 95%, and sewerage \ncoverage, from 31% to 90%. In particular, the Project will: \n(i)  Develop a new wellfield at Potu to replace the current infiltration galleries destroyed \nby frequent and severe river flooding. The project will construct and equip 3 new \nboreholes and complete/rehabilitate 2 existing ones, where construction was started \nbut connection into the town system was not completed because of a lack of funds. \nThis subcomponent will improve the quality of the drinking water source.  \n(ii)  Replace  the  existing  water  distribution  system  with  46  km  of  new  pipes,  and \nconstruct 3 elevated reservoirs and a chlorination facility. New connections will be \nprovided to households and industry, and metering of water will be introduced. \n(iii)  Construct 12 km of new main and branch sewers, 2 sewerage pumping stations and \na system of WSPs. \n \n4.  Nakhchivan. The proposed project will benefit the population of about 80,000 residents by \n2010. The number of water connections will increase from 45% to 70%, and sewerage coverage, \nfrom 41% to 67%. In particular, the Project will: \n(i)  Provide new and reliable gravity fed trunk mains from the Xaixal to Didivar infiltration \ngalleries,  including  flow  meters,  valves,  and  chambers.  Recently  constructed \ninfrastructure will be integrated into the system. \n(ii)  Construct  4  new  command  reservoirs  and  refurbish  6  existing  reservoirs,  \ninterconnecting them to create a chain at key locations for improved delivery of \nwater through gravity flow, to all consumers, eliminating the need for pumping within \nthe city.  \n(iii)  Improve key sections of the distribution system to reduce leakage and install a new \nring main to serve high-rise buildings by gravity (69 km). Metering of water will be \nintroduced, and new connections provided to expand main piped supplies. \n(iv)  Construct a series of WSPs to treat sewage to acceptable levels before discharging \nto the Arras River, and new main and branch sewers (61 km). \n ", "  Appendix 3   27\n5.  The water supply activities in all three projects will focus on providing an adequate quantity \nof potable quality water at the appropriate pressure and at the lowest cost to as many residents as \npossible.  Sanitation  activities  will  focus  on  upgrading  and  clearing  the  sewerage  systems, \nrehabilitation of selected sections that were poorly completed, collecting the sewage in relatively \nlow technology and low-maintenance biological WSPs to improve the quality of sewage before \ndischarging it safely to receiving streams. \n ", "28       Appendix 4 \nINSTITUTIONAL REFORM AND CAPACITY BUILDING COMPONENT \n \nA.  Background \n \n1. The project objective is to improve the quality, reliability, and sustainability of water supply \nand sanitation (WSS) services in the project towns. This objective will be achieved through \ninvestment  in  physical  infrastructure,  and  institutional  reforms  and  capacity  building.  This \nappendix describes the latter component. The principles involved are:  \n(i)  The \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d alternative is unsustainable and will result in the total collapse of \nthe  WSS  systems  and  services.  Several  institutional  options  were  considered  and \nanalyzed during the course of the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) (see \nTable A4). The third option in the table was chosen as optimal.  \n(ii) The objective of the institutional component is to find a sustainable model that will result \nin an autonomous utility with modern managerial skills, providing efficient and financially \nviable long-term operations. \n(iii) The adopted model should be in line with the government program of reforms in the \nsector, ongoing efforts by international donors, and ADB policy. Extensive discussions \non institutional options were held with stakeholders: various government agencies, local \nauthorities, communities, and international agencies. \n \nB.  Description of Institutional Component \n \n2.  The institutional component will involve (i) the establishment of new WSS utilities in the \nproject  towns  in  the  form  of  open-type  joint  stock  company  (JSC)  and  liquidation  of  the \nSuKanals, and (ii) creation of operational and managerial capacity of the JSCs by engaging the \nservices  of  an  experienced  international  operator  on  the  basis  of  the  performance-based \nmanagement contract (MC). The Project in the three towns should be considered as pilot in \nnature. It will provide much-needed experience for undertaking sector-wide reforms, test the \nreduced and optimized capital investments, and the new institutional model.  \n \nC.  Joint Stock Companies  \n \n3.  There  are  two  types  of  state-owned  enterprises  (SOE)  in  transition  economies: \ndepartments of state agencies/ministries that operate the state assets, and those that own, \noperate, and manage the state assets. The SuKanals in the project towns of Agdash and \nGoychay  were the WSS utility departments of the AzerSuKanal. They were transferred to \nAzerSu by presidential decree in June 2004. They operated, but did not own, assets, which \nbelong to the state. In Nakhchivan, there are two separate enterprises, for water supply and \nwastewater disposal, known as \u201coperating agencies.\u201d Transformation of these SOEs, including \nutilities, into JSCs that own the assets, with the state owning the shares in the company, is the \nfirst conventional step toward greater autonomy of the enterprise and corporatization.1 The new \nstatus  and  identity  of  the  utility  will  provide  a  foundation  for  autonomy  in  operation  and \nmanagement of the assets, and will allow parties other than the Government to acquire interest \nin, and responsibility for, the utility in the future. According to Azerbaijan legislation, only Ministry \nof Economic Development (MED) can represent state ownership. \n \n4.  The new JSCs will be run as professionally managed, socially responsible, technically \nsound and financially viable businesses. The JSCs will be formed for Agdash, Goychay, and \nNakhchivan. AzerSu will own shares in the JSCs in Agdash and Goychay, while MED will own \n                                                 \n1 For example, when the Apsheron Regional Water Company was established, it was organized as a JSC. \n ", "  Appendix 4  29 \nshares  of  the  JSC  in  Nakhchivan.  In  the  future,  JSCs\u2019  shares  may  be  sold  to  non-state \ninvestors. The JSCs will (i) own assets constructed and rehabilitated under the Project, and be \nresponsible for the operation, management, and maintenance of the new WSS systems; (ii) \nhave independence on financial, managerial, operational, and staffing decisions; and (iii) report \nto  AzerSu  in  Agdash  and  Goychay,  and  to  the  State  Committee  for  Construction  and \nArchitecture  (SCCA)  of  Nakhchivan  Autonomous  Republic  (NAR)  in  Nakhchivan,  and  be \naccountable for their performances. Decisions should not be imposed on the JSCs from outside. \nTo preserve the operational integrity and financial viability of the new JSCs, it is essential that \nneither old physical assets from the SuKanals, nor any of their outstanding debts and liabilities, \nbe transferred to them. \n \n5.  Each  JSC  should  have  a  board  of  directors.  Details  of  the  institutional  and  legal \narrangements for the JSCs, as well as the composition of their boards, will be developed under \nthe advisory TA associated with the Project. To ensure local participation in the WSS services, a \nmeaningful proportion of each board\u2019s voting rights will be assigned to the municipalities. The \nboards will determine policy on the supply and delivery of water and sewerage services, staff, \ncapital investments, operations and maintenance budgets, customer relations, tariffs and fees.  \n \n6.  The JSCs, with assistance of the project management units (PMUs), will engage the \nservices of an MC to operate the WSS services on their behalf for 3 to 5 years, and train local \nstaff to assume responsibility for the operation, management, and maintenance of the system. \nThe JSCs staff will comprise (i) a general manager for operations; (ii) a finance manager; and \n(iii) a compliment of technical, administrative, and operational support staff. The staff will be \nrecruited in close consultation with the MC, will receive on-the-job training during the life of the \nMC, and will eventually assume responsibility for operating and managing the WSS services. \n \n7.  During project implementation the JSCs will be implementing agencies, and will form the \nlocal project implementation units (PIUs). The PIUs will be staffed with construction supervision \npersonnel assigned from the design and supervision contract managed by the PMUs. In Agdash \nand Goychay, the PIUs will also be responsible for operating the existing WSS services during \nconstruction, and progressively phasing them out as new facilities become operational. Selected \noperational staff from the former SuKanals will be retained for the purpose. Upon completion, \nthe PIUs will hand over the WSS facilities to JSCs operations units. The PIUs will be disbanded \nwhen  construction  is  complete.  Appendix  6  describes  the  proposed  framework  for  project \nimplementation and the subsequent operation of completed facilities.    \n \nD.  Existing Water Supply and Sewerage Service Providers (SuKanals) \n \n8.  The SuKanals should cease as the JSCs are established and become operational. In \nAgdash and Goychay, the existing physical assets like the WSS systems and materials and \nequipment will be temporarily transferred to the PIUs for operation during construction of the \nnew facilities. A corresponding agreement will be signed between the PIUs (the new JSCs) and \nAzerSu. AzerSu will take the existing physical assets out of service and decommission them \nwhen the new WSS systems become operational. The existing staff of the old SuKanals will be \nretired and the PIUs will rehire, on a selective basis, sufficient staff to operate the interim \nservices during the construction phase. When the new WSS systems are constructed and put \ninto operation, the interim staff will resign and the JSCs, in consultation with the MC, will have \nthe option to selectively rehire them as permanent staff to operate the new facilities. The AzerSu \nand the SCCA of NAR should liquidate the SuKanals and make appropriate arrangements to \nsettle outstanding debts and liabilities. When the new systems are operating, the old assets \nhave no residual value and should be written off without charge to the JSCs. \n ", "30       Appendix 4 \nE.  Management Contractor \n \n9.  The MC will be appointed to bring international specialist expertise into the operation, \nmanagement, and maintenance of the new WSS facilities, and to train local staff to take full \nresponsibility for operating the services. The JSCs will appoint the MC. The PMUs will provide \ntechnical support during recruitment, particularly for preparing terms of reference, short-listing of \npotential firms, evaluation and ranking of proposals, and contract negotiation with selected \nfirms. The transaction adviser appointed under the TA will advise and guide on the form, scope,2 \nconditions, procurement procedures, and duration of the MC. The MC will be an international \nfirm or firms with experience in operating WSS utility companies for small- and medium-sized \nprovincial towns. The MC will be recruited through competitive bidding procedures acceptable to \nADB. \n  \n10.  The MC will provide two key personnel, (i) a chief engineer and operations manager, \nand (ii) a finance manager.  The MC will help recruit JSC staff to be trained to take over \nmanagement and operation of the services. The MC will become effective about one year \nbefore the physical construction work is completed. This will enable the MC to become familiar \nwith WSS systems as they are constructed, identify and select counterpart staff, and set up the \noperational, administrative, and financial management systems for the JSCs. During year 1, \nwhile construction is still underway, the MC will provide part-time, intermittent inputs. During \nyears 2 and 3, when the new WSS systems are fully operational, the MC will provide full-time \ninputs.  The  main  focus  during  this  time  will  be  to  refine  and  fine-tune  the  operational, \nadministrative, and financial management procedures, and to train the local staff. During year 4, \nthe MC will provide part-time, intermittent inputs to ensure that the utility is operating efficiently \nand cost effectively, and to hand over responsibility for operations and financial management to \nthe local JSC staffs. Before expiration of the MC, the JSCs, the Government, and ADB will \nreview future arrangements. \n     \n11.  The MC\u2019s remuneration will comprise a fixed fee and a performance-based element. The \ntransaction adviser will recommend and guide on the most appropriate form of MC and the \nspecific terms and conditions with respect to performance criteria and fee structure. The MC \nshould be relatively short-term with an important objective of training the JSCs\u2019 staff. The MC \nwill  not  require  the  contractor  to  make  financial  investments  in  either  the  expansion  or \nmaintenance of the systems. Supplementary Appendix 7 gives a detailed description of MC \nresponsibilities. \n \nF.  Regulator \n \n12.  It is understood that the Government is considering further restructuring of the WSS \nsector,  with  a  view  of  defining  and  assigning  its policy  setting,  regulatory,  and  operations \nfunctions. In the interim period, MED will continue to perform the policy setting and regulatory \nfunctions. \n  \n13.  The tariff council is currently under MED.

Methodology and Approach \n \n1.  The  economic  analysis  is  undertaken  in  accordance  with  Asian  Development  Bank's \n(ADB\u2019s) Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects, Handbook for the Economic Analysis of \nWater Supply Projects, Handbook for Integrating Poverty Impact Assessment in the Economic \nAnalysis of Projects and Guidelines for Integrating Risk Analysis in the Economic Analysis of \nProjects. This appendix summarizes the detailed economic analysis described in Supplementary \nAppendix 13. \n \n2.  The economic analysis is undertaken for the combined water supply and sanitation (WSS) \ncomponents in each of the project towns. The analysis describes the economic rationale, the \n\u201cwithout-project\u201d  situation,  project  benefits,  and  the  least-cost  analysis  of  alternatives  where \napplicable.  Based on the least-cost options, a tariff pricing policy was developed with emphasis on \nfinancial sustainability of the WSS services, and their affordability to the vulnerable groups to meet \ntheir basic needs. Further, water demand forecasts were developed on the basis of the proposed \nchanges in the WSS tariffs, taking into account price elasticity of demand of -0.35 and income \nelasticity of demand of 0.50. The analysis was based on the combined water and sewerage tariffs. \nThese demand estimates1 were then adjusted for budget and commercial/industrial consumption, \nplus seasonal and daily peaking factors, and were used to determine the optimal design capacity \nof the WSS systems and thus the justified scale of the investment. Capacity of the WSS systems \nwas designed for a 15-year planning horizon. \n \n3.  The  analysis  compared  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  to  the  economic \nopportunity  cost  of  capital  (EOCC),  which  is  assumed  to  be  12%.  Sensitivity  analyses  were \nundertaken for standard sensitivity tests and for project specific risks. A distribution analysis of \nproject benefits was prepared and the poverty impact ratio (PIR) calculated. The analysis adopted \nthe domestic price numeraire, since benefits are non-tradable in nature, and was undertaken in \nconstant 2004 prices. The analysis was undertaken over a 30-year period, with benefits held \nconstant from year 15 with no residual values assumed at the end of the period. \n \nB.  Economic Rationale and \u201cWithout-Project\u201d Situation \n \n4.  The urban WSS has suffered many years of neglect since independence. Assets have \ndeteriorated and lack of proper maintenance is such that service delivery in the three project towns \nis severely affected. Without major investment in the near future the WSS systems will continue to \ndeteriorate rapidly and approach a state of collapse, with serious consequences for economic \nactivity and livelihood. All of the project towns have suffered from the loss of economic activity and \nemployment  since  independence.  Although  the  outlook  is  now  more  positive  with  the  recent \nGovernment  emphasis  on  regional  development,  without  basic  infrastructure  improvements, \neconomic recovery and growth is likely to be hampered.  \n \n5.  Household surveys in the three project towns found that the actual level of service delivery \nis poor, with 95% respondents indicating that the overriding problem is a poor quality of water with \nit\u2019s high silt content. Some 27% of households receive water for only one or two days a week while \n20% receive it only on alternate days for 2-3 hours in all cases.  Estimates of water use indicated \nthat the actual consumption is constrained by lack of reliable supply, and is estimated at around 30 \nto 45 lpcd. In an unconstrained situation, the demand is estimated to be of the order of 80 to 100 \nlpcd. \n                                                 \n1  The estimated level of demand is considerably less than the Soviet norms used for water supply planning, which \nranged  from 150 liters per capita per day (lpcd) to 350 lpcd for secondary towns. \n ", "  Appendix 11  45 \n \n6.  The wastewater treatment plants in the project towns are in a deplorable state. Wastewater \nsimply passes through without any treatment, joins the nearest watercourse, or discharges to \nditches. The stagnant wastewater creates an environment for breeding of mosquitoes and is a \nthreat to health conditions. During periods of high rainfall, drains overflow with sewerage flowing \ninto the streets and houses, creating further health and environmental hazards. \n \n7.  In  the  \u201cwithout-project\u201d  scenario  the  per  capita  supply  is  expected  to  decline.  These \nconditions are likely to arise within three to five years from now in Agdash and Goychay. One might \nargue that these conditions have already arisen now \u2013 water supplied in most of the towns that \ndraw on the Kura river essentially provide \u2018mud\u2019 \u2013 with the population having a high additional cost \nburden to filter, add chemicals and boil the water. They also have to clean out the sediment that \naccumulates  in  their  storage  tanks.  In  the  future  as  service  levels  continue  to  decline,  the \npopulation will need to resort to alternative untreated water supplies and/or will purchase a greater \nproportion of water from tankered supplies from private vendors. Alternatively the Sukanals will \nneed to develop tankered supplies to service the urban population and those industries that are \ncurrently served by the public water supply. \n \n8.  The economic analysis assumes that further deterioration continues in the \u2018without-project\u2019 \nsituation, with the water supply systems in Agdash and Goychay nearing total collapse, while that \nfor Nakchivan is likely to continue for a number of years before it may collapse in case of no \nintervention. Thus capital expenditure is now critical to improve the operational performance of \nthese systems, in addition to the required institutional changes (see Appendix 4).  \n \nC.  Project Benefits \n \n9.  The project social surveys found that residents ranked improvements to the WSS systems \nas high priority to improve their quality of life. The Project has high priority for the Government. Due \nto the proposed new institutional model, the project is pilot in nature, with a view of addressing the \nWSS services eventually in all secondary towns. The Project will benefit about 147,000 residential \nusers, industries and small businesses in the three towns by the end of the project in 2010. Access \nto  safe  and  reliable  water  supply  systems  and  properly  operating  sewerage  and  wastewater \ntreatment  systems  will  benefit  the  poor  and  non-poor  alike,  as  they  are  not  geographically \nseparated, and all households have access to the improved system. \n \n10.  The WSS component will (i) provide safe and reliable drinking water, including extended \nservice areas; (ii) generate major efficiency gains by providing systems that are more properly \nsized to demand requirements, reduce system losses, reduce staff and maintenance costs; (iii) \nimprove cost recovery through better customer satisfaction with service delivery; (iv) improve the \nhealth  and well-being of  the  people  in  three secondary  towns  through  reduced  water-related \ndiseases and better hygiene practices; (v) reduce the financial burden, time spent on, and cost of, \nwater collection, storage, and boiling and other treatment of water, particularly for women; and (vi) \nsupport economic recovery and growth.  Unaccounted-for-water (UFW) will be reduced in Agdash \nand Goychay from the currently estimated 70% to 25% with the major replacement of the water \nsupply transmission and distribution systems, and in Nakhchivan to 50% through leak detection \nand improved management of the existing distribution system. The Project is timely, and was \ncoordinated  with  investment  activities  of  other  donor  organizations  such  as  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr \nWiederaufbau (KfW).  \n \nD.  Analysis of Alternatives \n \n11.  The scope of the physical infrastructure component was determined on the basis of the \nfeasibility  studies  carried  out  during  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  and \n ", "46  Appendix 11 \nfurther refinements during the Loan Fact-Finding mission. Analysis of alternative technical options \nwas undertaken, and the least-cost development options were identified. For the water source, the \ndevelopment of new borehole fields in Agdash and Goychay was compared with a number of \noptions, including reinstatement of the presently destroyed infiltration galleries.2 Hydrogeological \nanalyses of alluvial cones have been undertaken, and it is concluded that the proposed well fields \nhave adequate supply of good quality water over the life of the project.  The capital and operating \ncosts of the borehole fields were found to be least cost when compared with the costs of having to \nreinstate and protect the infiltration gallery infrastructures. Importantly, to make this latter option \nviable and sustainable, significant institutional arrangements would need to be put in place for \nbetter  management  of  the  river  catchments.  In  Nakhchivan,  the  existing  infiltration  galleries \nrepresent a good reliable source compared with the alternative of developing new sources. \n \n12.  The  feasibility  studies  have  shown  that  repair  and  rehabilitation  of  the  existing  WSS \nsystems is not practical in Agdash and Goychay for technical, financial, and economic reasons. \nThe Project will replace dilapidated and inefficient distribution systems in Agdash and Goychay, \nand  upgrade  the  system  in  Nakhchivan.  The  proposed  schemes  will  also  improve  pressure \nmanagement due to proper zoning of the distribution system and connections to appropriately \nlocated storage reservoirs in all three towns.  \n \n13.  The existing sewage treatment works in each town are not functioning, and raw sewerage \nis discharged to rivers. Alternatives for treating the sewage include (i) conventional biological \ntreatment, (ii) mechanical/physical treatment, and (iii) waste stabilization ponds. The advantages \nand  disadvantages  of each  system  were  considered. Waste  stabilization  ponds  were  chosen \nbecause  of  the  low  capital  requirements,  adequate  municipal  land  availability,  and  the  low \noperating costs with no requirement for energy and chemicals. \n \nC.  Economic Costs \n \n14.  The  economic  costs  have  been  calculated  by  converting  project  financial  capital  and \noperation and maintenance (O&M) costs to economic values. For capital and O&M costs this \ninvolves the following adjustments: (i) deducting value added tax (VAT) at 18%; (ii) adjusting the \ncost of imported (tradable) items by a shadow exchange rate factor (SERF) of 1.02; (iii) adjusting \nthe cost of the unskilled labor by the shadow wage rate factor (SWRF) of 0.8 to reflect local \nunemployment levels; (iv) for O&M costs unskilled labor has been assumed to make up 10% of \nengineering maintenance costs and 50% of the cost of staff for the water distribution and sewerage \nsystems; (v) increasing the cost of electricity by 50% (to $0.04/kWh) to reflect more closely the \neconomic cost of electricity generation. Capital replacement costs for electrical and mechanical \nequipment are assumed every 10 years at 5% of total project costs. \n \nD.  Economic Benefits \n \n15.  For water supply the non-incremental benefits were valued using the resource cost savings \napproach for: (i) private boreholes, (ii) water from tanker trucks/private vendors, (iii) time savings \nfor water collection,  (iii) ground level water storage tanks, (iv) pumping from ground to elevated \ntanks, and (v) boiling and filtering water. The valuation of benefits was based on the social surveys \nand discussions in the towns of the likely consequences of the \u201cwithout-project\u201d situation and the \ncollapse of the systems. In both Agdash and Goychay the existing infiltration gallery water sources \nhave been destroyed and only temporary structures exist in their place. These are also likely to be \n                                                 \n2  The high silt content of water in Agdash and Goychay is due to a severe destruction of infiltration galleries laid in beds \nof rivers. Typical torrential flows, following rainfall and snowmelt cause severe pebble and boulder transport. In the last \nfive years the floods have been reported to be more severe than usual, and as a result many infiltration galleries were \ncompletely destroyed. Strongly sediment-laden water has thus entered the water supply and the sewerage systems.  \n ", "  Appendix 11  47 \nwashed away during future floods and mudslides. In the case of Agdash this would lead to \nconsiderable costs involved with tankering water to supply basic needs as no alternative sources \nexist. In Goychay, while there would be some increase in tankering, boreholes within the town \ncould also be used to supply some water. In Nakhchivan the existing water source is adequate but \nthe distribution system is likely to collapse.  Incremental benefits result from the increase in supply \nof water multiplied by the future financial supply price of water plus half of the difference between \nthe future supply price and the cost of pre-project supply (contributing to consumer surplus). \n  \n16.  One of the significant benefits of the Project is improved environmental conditions due to \nthe  improved  wastewater  collection  and  treatment.  However,  it  has  not  been  possible  to \nadequately quantify these benefits in terms of the improved health, hygiene, and environmental \nconditions. Accordingly the valuation of benefits is regarded as conservative. \n \nE.  Results \n \n17.  The overall project EIRR is 21.8%, with Agdash 25.5%, Goychay, 24.8% and Nakhchivan \n18.7%. Thus the EIRR exceeds the EOCC at 12%. Switching values and sensitivity indicators \ndemonstrated that the subprojects are economically viable under adverse circumstances. The \nadditional  project  specific  sensitivities  were  undertaken  as  part  of  the  risk  assessment.  For \nexample, the sensitivity to the cost of tankered water was analyzed on the assumption that its \nsupply would become more competitive in the situation of the total collapse of the towns\u2019 water \nsystems. Reducing the price by 50% shows that the overall results are not sensitive to this change. \nAdditionally, the SWRF was reduced by 10% to 0.75 to test whether this was overstated. Again it \nhas  little  impact  on  the  results.  Finally,  to  analyze  the  institutional  risks  and  implementation \nchallenges, the impact of delays combined with an increase in capital costs was tested. The results \nshowed that the Project is sensitive to a two-year delay and a 20% increase in capital costs, but \nnevertheless the EIRR remains above 12%. In terms of switching values the Project is most \nsensitive to a reduction in benefits. However, in the worst case, benefits would need to fall by 36% \nbefore the EIRR reaches 12.0%.  \n \nTable A11.1:  Summary EIRR Results and Sensitivity (%) \n \nAgdash  Goychay  Nakhchivan  Project \nItem    (%)  (%)  (%)  (%) \nEOCC    12.0  12.0  12.0  12.0 \nEIRR    25.5  24.8  18.7  21.8 \nCapital Costs +10%    22.6  22.8  17.2  20.1 \nOperating Costs +10%    25.5  24.7  18.7  21.8 \nRevenues -10%    23.3  22.5  17.0  19.9 \nAll the above +/-10%    21.4  20.7  15.5  18.2 \nTankered water costs  -50%    21.8  23.4  18.5   \nReducing SWRF -10%    24.8  24.1  18.1   \nDelayed 2 yrs, capital costs +20%  16.5  16.0  12.8  14.3 \nCapital Costs - Switching Values  126  118  60   \nBenefit Decrease - Switching Values  43  48  36   \nSource: ADB staff estimates  \n \nF.

Existing Water and Sewerage Tariffs  \n \n1.  Tariffs for the three project towns are summarized in Table A12.1. Currently, there is a \nsimple volumetric tariff with up to four classes of customers: (i) residential, (ii) government \nbudget agencies, (iii) industrial, and (iv) commercial customers. However, in the absence of \nmetering, monthly billings are based on household numbers and consumption norms. In the \ncase of budget organizations, industry and commerce, specific contracts are entered into based \non estimated usage. Thus monthly billings for all customer classes are based on estimates of \nusage, rather than actual usage. \n \nTable A12.1: Current Water and Sewerage Tariffs in Project Towns (AZM per m3) \n \n  Residential  Budget  Industry  Commercial \nWater         \nAgdash  176  392  490  490 \nGoychay  315  610  609  609 \nNakhchivan  175  300  400  400 \n         \nSewerage         \nAgdash  -  239  266  266 \nGoychay  180  210  208  208 \nNakhchivan  67  110  140  140 \nSource: State Committee for Construction and Architecture, PPTA reports. \n \n2.  The current financial performance of SuKanals is poor. Tariffs are very low, and there is \nhigh customer resistance to paying water bills due to the poor level of services. Therefore, to \nimprove  financial  performance,  it  will  be  necessary  to  set  tariffs  to  achieve  levels  of  cost \nrecovery  that  will  ensure  sustainability  of  the  systems  provided  under  the  Project.  Project \nhousehold surveys indicate customers would be willing to pay for the systems that provide 24-\nhour good quality potable water, together with wastewater collection and treatment systems.  \n \nB.  Tariff Policies and Objectives \n \n3.  Tariff Objectives. The first step is to define the objectives that water and wastewater \ntariffs  would  ideally  meet.  The  objectives  are  those  commonly  accepted  for  water  and \nwastewater tariffs consistent with international best practice. Tariff structures may then be \ndeveloped with the overall aim of achieving these objectives. The following objectives are of \nparticular importance in the setting of water and wastewater tariff structures and tariffs: (i) \nfinancial sustainability and full cost recovery, (ii) economic efficiency and marginal costs, (iii) \nprice equity, (iv) administrative efficiency and good governance, (v) affordability and universal \naccess.  Where the charge for wastewater is to be levied as an addition to the water charge, \nconsumers will not be able to distinguish between them; therefore, it is necessary to consider \nobjectives for the combined water and wastewater charge.  \n \n4.  Financial Sustainability and Full Cost Recovery. In the first instance it is necessary \nfor the enterprise to meet its cash flow needs, defined as cash operating costs plus any debt \nservice costs (both interest and principal). This is regarded as the minimum cost recovery \nobjective.  \n \n5.  The enterprise should then move to meet full cost recovery (FCR). This will include \noperating cost cash outgoings plus the greater of depreciation or financing charges (interest and \n ", "50  Appendix 12 \nprincipal payments), and a return on net fixed assets, generally set in the range of 5% to 8% of \nnet fixed assets in service. The latter should be regarded as the medium to long-term goal. \n \n6.  The methodology used to calculate tariffs by the Azerbaijan Tariff Council and its Water \nand Sanitation Working Group is to allow a profit margin of 10% to 15% on operating costs. \nAllowable  operating  costs  are  defined  as  all  cash  operating  costs,  plus  interest  plus \ndepreciation. The assumption is that any debt repayment could be met out of depreciation \ncharges.  \n \n7.  Economic Efficiency and Marginal Costs. Economic efficiency promotes the efficient \nuse of national resources. At it\u2019s most basic level, economic efficiency occurs when no change \nin the tariff would benefit someone without making someone else worse off. Economic theory \nsuggests that this is done when the marginal tariff (volumetric or usage charge) is equal to the \nenterprise\u2019s marginal costs. Once the usage charge is set, at whatever level is required for \nefficiency purposes, the amount to be raised from fixed charges can be calculated as the \ndifference to achieve FCR.  \n \n8.  In the Azerbaijan secondary towns, the projects are designed with a 15 to 20 year time \nhorizon. Thus there could be some excess capacity in the system in the next five to ten years, \nwhich use could be encouraged through the tariff structure. It would be possible to set usage \ncharges based on variable costs with the balance of charges necessary to achieve the desired \nlevel of cost recovery incorporated into the monthly fixed charge. \n \n9.  In  discussions  with  the  Tariff  Council,  Water  and  Sanitation  Working  Group,  they \nindicated that they did not favor a two-part tariff for domestic tariff category, but that they could \npossibly introduce such a structure for non-domestic customers. They cited the examples of a \ncustomer using only a low amount of water or no water, and incurring the high fixed charge, \nwhich could lead to many complaints. \n \n10.  While two-part tariffs may promote economic efficiency for the utility, other prices in the \neconomy should be set with the same objective, in order to achieve the full economic benefits. \nIn practice this does not occur at the present time, so that the full benefits of such a structure \nwould not be realized.  \n \n11.  Price Equity. The aim of price equity is to base tariffs on \u201cfair\u201d criteria and this is best \ndone when the charge is based on costs traced to or caused by each customer. In water supply, \nthere  will  be  few  variations  in  costs  due  to  individual  entities  or  classes.  In  the  case  of \nwastewater charges, price equity involves introduction of the Polluter Pays Principle where \nindustry (and households) should pay the costs they cause at the wastewater treatment plant to \ntreat their effluent discharge.  \n \n12.  In the Project towns there are four classes of customers. These classes will face similar \ncosts  of  supply.  However,  during  discussions  with  the  Tariff  Council  it  was  indicated  that \nindustry and commercial charges could be higher relative to residential customers than those \nproposed by the Project, and that government budget organizations could be charged more \nthan domestic customers. It was indicated that such structuring was used to make charges to \ndomestic users affordable, by increasing charges to other customer groups and reducing those \nto domestic users, thus introducing cross subsidies into the pricing structure.  \n \n13.  Administrative  Efficiency  and  Good  Governance.  Tariffs  can  promote  good \ngovernance in many different ways.  The charges resulting from the tariff should be clear to \ncustomers, so that they can understand how they might modify their use of the service. The \n ", "    Appendix 12    51 \ntariff should be simple enough for the enterprise to calculate, in terms both of the total sum to be \nrecovered and of the charge to be levied on each customer. The tariff should be immune to \ninterference from employees of the enterprise, who might use the tariff to collect bribes, and \nfrom politicians, who might use the tariff to collect votes.  \n \n14.  Affordability and Universal Access. Affordability is also related to the concept of \nuniversal  access.  For  water  supply,  this  relates  to  some  socially  approved  minimum.  For \nwastewater, the presence of external benefits in disposing the wastewater hygienically suggests \ngreater societal incentives for universal coverage. \n \n15.  On the basis of discussions with the local and central Government and the Project \nhousehold surveys, the following is assumed for the project towns: \n(i)  for households with average incomes, payment of 3\u20135% of their incomes for \ngood  quality  piped  water  supply  and  sanitation  (WSS)  services  (consuming \naround 90\u2013100 lpcd) in the urban areas is considered reasonable; \n(ii)  the basic needs of poor urban households in Azerbaijan\u2019s secondary towns (the \naverage of the lowest quartile) is 45 lpcd; \n(iii)  a maximum level of payment of 5% of the poor households\u2019 income required to \nmeet the basic WSS requirements is regarded as acceptable. \n \n16.  Vulnerable groups in the secondary towns in Azerbaijan have higher poverty risk and \nless  capacity  to  overcome  poverty.  Vulnerable  groups  in  secondary  towns  include  the \nunemployed, internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees, elderly people, the disabled, war \nveterans,  pensioners,  and  widowed  women.  The  families  that  have  lost  their  heads  of \nhousehold, widows, and martyrs receive pensions to compensate for the loss of workforce in the \nfamily. Nonetheless, the IDPs and refugees are especially vulnerable groups in Azerbaijan. At \npresent they are supported by the state budget and by the State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan. The \nIDPs and refugees are exempt from paying utilities bills.  \n \nC.  Proposed Water and Wastewater Tariff Levels and Structures \n \n1.  Tariff Structures \n \n17.  The  Tariff  Council  indicated  that  it  could  not  see  two-part  fixed  and  variable  tariff \nstructures presently being introduced. Non-domestic charges are charged on the basis of an \nannual agreement, so effectively, they face a fixed monthly charge for water bills. However, with \nthe introduction of metering it would be relatively easy to separate out the usage or volumetric \ncharge (based on variable costs) and charge the balance as the monthly fixed charge, with this \nvarying on the basis of pipe or meter size. In the case of residential customers the first major \nstep in Azerbaijan is to introduce metering. The Tariff Council believe that a uniform volumetric \ncharge would at the moment satisfy the objectives set out above, namely achievement of \nfinancial sustainability, equity, administrative efficiency and good governance, and affordability. \n \n2.  Proposed Financial Tariffs For Project Towns \n \n18.  Water  and  wastewater  tariff  increases  for  domestic  and  budget  categories  are \nsummarized in the table below. A major increase to cover operating costs and loan interest \npayments is proposed in 2008, with further adjustments in 2010 and 2012 to reach the targeted \nlevel of debt servicing. Thereafter tariffs are increased in line with inflation. The initial increase in \ntariffs will be introduced at the time when the new quality WSS services will be introduced as a \n ", "52  Appendix 12 \nresult of the Project.1 Charges to commercial and industrial customers which are currently \nalmost  double  domestic  levels  will  remain  at  two  times  the  proposed  domestic  levels.  In \nparticular in the case of sewerage this reflects the higher biochemical oxygen demand  and \nsuspended  solids  concentrations  in  wastewater  from  agricultural  processing  industries  and \nrestaurants requiring greater treatment.  \n \n19.  In terms of tariff structures, the tariff for each customer class will be a uniform charge per \nm3 consumed. All customers will be metered and will pay on the basis of usage. However, in the \ncase  of  commercial  and  industrial  customers  they  are  still  likely  to  be  subject  to  annual \nagreements, which will result in fixed monthly charges with any additional consumption likely to \nbe  charged  at  the  proposed  tariff.  In  the  case  of  domestic  customers  no  lifeline  block  is \nproposed, as basic needs of the poor households can be met at less than 5% of household \nincome. \n \nTable A12.2 : Proposed Tariffs (AZM per m3) \n \nItem  2008  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013 \nAgdash             \nWater Tariffs  984  984  1,230  1,230  1,537  1,575 \nSewerage Tariffs  671  671  839    839  1,049  1,075 \nProposed Increase (%)  375  0  25  0  25  3 \nGoychay             \nWater Tariffs  945  945  1,134  1,134  1,361  1,395 \nSewerage Tariffs  540  540  648  648  778  797 \nProposed Increase (%)  200  0  20  0  20  3 \nNakhchivan             \nWater Tariffs  831  831  998  998  1,197  1,227 \nSewerage Tariffs  569  569  683  683  819  839 \nProposed Increase (%)  375  0  20  0  20  3 \nSource: ADB staff estimates. \n \n20.  The tariffs introduced by the Joint Venture Berlinwasser International Limited and Imishly \nSuKanal  in  2002  are  as  follows:  domestic  AZM1,000/m3;  budget  AZM3,000/m3; \ncommercial/industry AZM5,000/m3; and water trucks AZM7,000 to 12,000/m3, depending on the \ndistance  traveled  to  serve  the  towns\u2019  outskirts.  The  supply  of  water  is  increased  from  2 \nhours/day  in  the  past  to  10-15  hours/day  to  the  current  customers.  This  necessitates  the \ncontinuing  need  for  the  in-house  storage.  The  willingness  to  pay  is  demonstrated  by  the \nimproved collection rates, reaching about 80% in the second year. Apart from operating costs, \nthe company needs to repay a Euro 3 million loan at an interest rate of 0.75%. It is expected \nthat domestic tariffs would need to increase to AZM3,000/m3 over the next three years to meet \nloan repayments. \n \nD.  Affordability of Proposed Tariffs \n \n21.  Table  A12.3  sets  out  the  affordability  of  an  average  income  household  consuming \naround 100 lpcd and a low-income household (average of the lowest quartile) to meet the basic \nneeds defined at 45 lpcd. For the average income household, monthly water and wastewater \nbills as a percent of household income range from 3.5% to 4.8% in 2012. For a low-income \nhousehold, to meet the basic needs, the percent ranges from 2.3% to 4.2% in 2012. The \namount to be spent on water and wastewater bills under the Project is considerably less than \n                                                 \n1  The product to be provided under the Project, both in terms of water supply and wastewater services, is clearly \nsuperior to that available at the present time, to the extent that the two products cannot be compared for price \nelasticity purposes in the initial year. \n ", "    Appendix 12    53 \nthe current average coping costs in each town that range from 5.0% to 8.5% of household \nincome for the average, and 7.2% to 12.7% for the low income household as a proportion of \ntheir monthly income.

Background \n \n1.  The financial analysis of the Project was carried out in accordance with the Guidelines \nfor the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by the ADB \n(2001). The financial analysis calculates the required tariffs (see Appendix 12), undertakes \nfinancial appraisal of each subproject, including the financial internal rate of return (FIRR), and \nprovides financial projections for the three joint stock companies (JSCs). \n \n2.  The financial performance of the SuKanals in the project towns is poor. While revenues \nbased  on  water  sales  could  cover  operating  costs,  available  cash  is  insufficient  to  meet \noperation and maintenance (O&M) costs and depreciation. The bill collection rates are low \n(Agdash, 65%; Goychay, 68%; and Nakhchivan, 28%); and depreciation is grossly understated. \nThus, there is insufficient funding to pay for O&M costs, major repairs, and rehabilitation. This \nsituation has led to the progressive deterioration of the water supply and sanitation (WSS) \nsystems. Although tariffs are low, there is high customer resistance to paying water bills due to \nthe poor level and quality of WSS services. SuKanals continue to operate in a deficit situation by \nnot paying their electricity bills and government taxes. \n \nTable A13.1: Summary of Revenues and Expenses of SuKanals, 2002 \nItem  Agdash  Goychay  Nakhchivan \n(AZM million) \nRevenue  119  352  404 \nCosts  221  416  433 \nProfit /(Loss)  (102)  (64)  (29) \nSources: State Committee for Construction and Architecture, PPTA reports. \n \n3.  It is estimated that without the Project the situation will steadily deteriorate, and in \nAgdash and Goychay the systems will collapse in 3 to 5 years. In Agdash, without other water \nsources, the SuKanal will need to supply water by tankers. The Project will arrest the downward \nspiral of poor service delivery, aging assets, and low collection rates. Conditions will be created \nthat allow the JSCs to become fully self-financing and sustainable water utilities in the long run. \n \nB.  Water Demand Projections \n \n4.  Demand projections for the next 20 years take into account the future changes in water \nand wastewater tariffs, and increases in income. The estimates of the underlying demand are \nbased on the following assumptions:  \n(i)  Population growth of 1% per year in Agdash and Goychay, and 0.5% in Nakhchivan; \n(ii)  Household size: Agdash 5.03, Goychay 5.12, Nakhchivan 4.7; \n(iii)  Baseline (2007) per capita demand of 100 liters per capita day (lpcd); \n(iv)  Proportion of population connected to water supply by 2010 reaches 95% in Agdash \nand Goychay, and 70% in Nakhchivan; \n(v)  Proportion of population connected to sewerage by 2010 reaching 95% of those \nconnected to water; \n(vi)  Real growth in per capita income of 5% per year; \n(vii)  Income elasticity of demand of 0.5, and price elasticity of demand of \u20130.35; \n(viii)  Industrial/commercial demand increasing at the rate of economic growth, or 6% per \nannum in Agdash and Nakhchivan, and 7% in Goychay; \n(ix)  Three tariff categories are proposed based on the customer classes: (a) residential, \n(b) government budget organizations, and (c) industry and commerce. \n ", "  Appendix 13  55 \n(x)  Tariff increases for domestic and budget categories for water and sewerage as \nfollows: 2008, 375% for Agdash and Nakhchivan, and 200% for Goychay; 2010, 20% \nto 25%; 2012, 20% to 25%; and each year thereafter in line with inflation forecast at \n2.5% per annum. \n(xi)  Charges to industry and commerce, which are currently almost double the domestic \nlevels, will remain at twice the proposed domestic levels, particularly for sewerage to \nreflect the higher biochemical oxygen demand and suspended solids concentrations \nin  wastewater  from  agricultural  processing  industries  and  restaurants  requiring \ngreater treatment. \n(xii)  Upon construction of the new systems in Agdash and Goychay, and rehabilitation of \nassets in Nakhchivan by 2008, it is assumed that losses will reduce to 25% in \nAgdash and Goychay, and decline to 50% in Nakhchivan. When the new systems \nbecome  operational,  consumption  will  increase  with  improvement  in  service \nprovision, population, number of connections, and income, but will be constrained by \nincreases in tariffs.  \n \n5.  The initial real increases in tariffs in 2008 for all three towns will result in charges that are \nless than the coping costs now incurred by domestic users. The quality of the product to be \nprovided under the Project, both in terms of water supply and wastewater services, is clearly \nsuperior to that available at the present time to the extent that the two products cannot be \ncompared. For this reason the initial tariff adjustment has not been subject to elasticity of \ndemand impacts. \n \nC.  Financial Analysis of the Project  \n \n6.  Financial analysis was carried out for each subproject town, comparing the FIRR with \nthe weighted average cost of capital (WACC); and the average incremental financial cost with \nthe average incremental financial revenue. Sensitivity tests were undertaken to assess the \nimpact of project risks (described in the RRP text) on the financial viability of the Project. \nSwitching values and sensitivity indicators were also calculated. The analysis is in 2004 prices. \n \n7.  The  WACC  was  estimated  based  on  the  JSC  cost  of  borrowing  of  2.5%  and  the \nopportunity cost to the Government in providing equity to the Project. In the absence of any \nGovernment domestic bond market, the return on the Government's investments in the State Oil \nFund of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ) was taken as a proxy for the opportunity cost of capital. The \nSOFAZ is the main source of the Government development finance. The SOFAZ average return \non investments in 2003 is estimated at 5%. After adjusting for inflation and the mix of debt and \nequity in each town, the average WACC is 1.3%. \n \n8.  Project  capital  expenditures  include  physical  contingencies.  Replacement  costs  are \nincluded for meters, and electrical and mechanical equipment after 10 years. Revenues include \nall water sales as the systems are expected to collapse in the next three to five years in the \n\u201cwithout-the-project\u201d situation. In addition, reductions in operating costs as a result of the new \noptimized WSS systems are taken as benefits of the Project.  \n \n9.  The FIRR for the Project is 4.4%, with 5.5% in Goychay, 4.4% in Nakhchivan, and 3.6% \nin Agdash. Thus the FIRR exceeds the WACC. The switching values and sensitivity indicators \ndemonstrated that the subprojects remain financially viable under adverse circumstances. For \nexample, the FIRR in Agdash would fall to its WACC (1.6%), if revenues decline by 17% or \ncosts increase by 28%. Two project-specific sensitivities were undertaken to measure the risk of \nnot being able to achieve improved collection efficiencies, and a delay in the Project by 2 years, \n ", "56  Appendix 13 \naccompanied by project cost increases of 20%.

Financial Projections of the Project Towns\u2019 Joint Stock Companies \n \n10.  Detailed financial projections were prepared for the three project towns over the period \n2005 to 2016. It is assumed that JSCs will become operational in 2005 and operate the existing \nsystems (on behalf of AzerSu and State Committee for Construction and Architecture (SCCA) of \nNakhchivan Autonomous Republic (NAR). This means that they will continue to collect revenues \nto meet operating costs. From 2008, the JSCs will start operating the new (in Agdash and \nGoychay) and improved (in Nakhchivan) WSS systems and realizing the benefits of the reduced \nO&M costs. The JSCs will be assisted by a performance-based management contractor (MC) to \noperate the systems, and the JSCs staff will be provided intensive training from 2008 to 2010. \nThe projected financial statements are in current prices, and are adjusted for domestic inflation, \nassumed at 2.5% per annum. \n \n11.  Under the proposed project, the newly constructed assets will be transferred to the \nJSCs. A portion of the Asian Development Fund (ADF) loan ($8.0 million) will be re-lent from the \nGovernment to AzerSu, which in turn will re-lend to the Agdash and Goychay JSCs. A portion of \nthe ordinary capital resources (OCR) loan ($9.3 million) will be re-lent to the Nakhchivan JSC. \nThe subsidiary loans and subloans will be Manat-denominated, and their terms and conditions \nwill be defined in subsidiary and subloan agreements satisfactory to ADB. The Government will \nbear the interest and foreign exchange risks, which will be reflected in the relending and \nonlending terms. The JSCs will repay these subloans through collection of user charges. Grant \nportions of $6.5 million, $2.8 million, and $2.3 million will be transferred through budgetary \nappropriations to the Agdash, Goychay, and Nakhchivan JSCs, respectively. For each town, the \nproposed on-lending terms are: an interest rate of 2.5% per annum, with repayment over 25 \nyears, with a grace period of 6 years covering the construction period plus MC\u2019s initial term. \nInterest payments, however, will commence in year 4, after commissioning.  \n \n12.  Fixed assets held by the Sukanals and operated by the JSCs over the construction \nperiod will not necessarily be transferred to the JSCs on completion of the new project assets in \n2008. In the case of Agdash and Goychay, little of the existing system will continue to operate, \nbut in the case of Nakhchivan, some distribution and transmission assets will be transferred to \nthe JSC. No debts or liabilities of the Sukanals will be transferred to the new JSCs. \n \n ", "  Appendix 13  57 \n13.  Collection efficiency is assumed to increase to a 90% average by 2010. That will be \nmajor task of the MC when it commences activities in 2008. From 2005 to 2007 the project \nimplementation units (PIUs) established in the JSCs will operate and manage the existing \nassets, and collect revenues. As sections of the new system are completed, they will be handed \nover to the JSCs for operation. Following the supply of safe potable water at adequate pressure \nfor 24 hours per day, tariffs will be raised in 2008. \n \n 14.  The financial objectives that should be adopted for the JSCs are: (i) debt service ratio of \nat least 1.0 from 2008 and 1.2 from 2012 so as to ensure adequate cash flow to meet debt \nservice requirements each year; (ii) full cost recovery target incorporating a 5% return on \nhistoric net fixed assets in service as a future objective to attract private sector investment. This \nmay be practical from 2015 onwards. (iii) Accounts receivable not to exceed 90 days over the \nperiod 2005 to 2010, and 60 days thereafter. \n \n15.  Over the period 2008 to 2011 the JSCs may make accounting losses in some years, but \ngenerate sufficient cash to meet their operating costs and any loan interest payments. From \n2012 revenues should be sufficient to meet O&M costs and depreciation, plus debt servicing \nand achieve a debt service ratio of 1.2. On this basis the JSCs are expected to be sustainable \nover the long term.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis  \nSector identified as a national priority    Sector identified as a national priority   \nin country poverty analysis?     Yes  in country poverty partnership  N/A \nagreement?   \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Azerbaijan:  \n \nThe secondary towns in Azerbaijan are characterized by a nonfunctional system of water supply and \nsanitation (WSS). Having inherited an infrastructure dating back to the 1960s, the system in secondary \ntowns is characterized by low water quality, unreliable water availability, and overflowing ditches. The \nwater shortage particularly affects the poor. Many consumers augment supply by buying water from \nprivate vendors. Similarly, sewerage systems are failing, pipes are clogged and broken, raw sewage \nfloods the streets and house compounds during heavy rains, and treatment facilities do not work. The \nWSS service providers suffer from weak technical and financial management capability and capacity, and \nunder-investment in maintenance and capital works. \n \nAccess to clean water is a target of the United Nation\u2019s Millennium Goals. This point is further stressed in \nthe Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) \u201cWater for All\u201d strategy. Even though the sector has no direct \npoverty reduction impact, the Project influences the overall quality of life of the poor. The Project aims to \nimprove water service standards, thus improving people\u2019s access to potable water, giving communities \nsafe drinking water from their home taps. The Project also improves the existing sewerage systems, and \nconnects all households to centralized sewerage, creating a safe and healthy environment for each \ncommunity. This particularly benefits poorer households that have lacked access to centralized sewerage. \nThe Project helps alleviate water shortages in secondary towns on a sustainable and  long-term basis, and \nthus improves the health and well-being of its inhabitants. Enhanced WSS systems lead to healthier \ncommunities by providing reliable access to potable water, and good sewerage systems.    \n \nThe Project\u2019s primary target population is the 147,000 people living in three secondary towns of Agdash, \nGoychay, and Nakhchivan. Half are poor families. The Project will provide the population access to a safe, \nadequate, reliable, and sustainable supply of piped, potable water.  The Project will also provide access to \neffective and hygienic sanitation and wastewater disposal through individual property connections to a \nsewerage network and sewage treatment facilities. By the end of the Project, water coverage in the project \narea will increase from 55% to 80%, and sewerage coverage will increase from 43% to 77%. By 2010, an \nestimated 147,000 people will benefit from improved water supply and quality, increased quantity, \nextended service areas, more equitable water distribution, and better customer services.  These benefits \nwill go hand-in-hand with higher standards of public health, hygiene, and improved sanitation facilities and \nmaintenance.   \n \nThe survey showed that water quality is worsened by contamination from polluted shallow ground water \nand leaky distribution pipes. Poor water quality impacts sharply on public health.  Although details are not \navailable, the survey suggests that the impact of water-borne diseases on morbidity and mortality rates is \nhigh in the project area.  The Project will reduce the incidence of diarrhea, dysentery, and skin diseases; \nand will also reduce sick time caused by water-borne diseases.   \n \nThe water shortage particularly impacts the poor. WSS expenses do not differ between poorer and richer \nhouseholds, which may be a consequence of the use of normative pricing rather than meters.  The survey \nindicated that the WSS costs make up a considerably higher portion of total expenditures for the poor than \nfor the rich. Furthermore, people with no access to a central water supply must purchase water from \nmerchants at a higher price, or go to public water sources, spending additional time and money for \nqueuing, water storage, and boiling. Hardship in water management is more severe among poorer \nhouseholds, particularly among women, who are mostly responsible for water collection, storage, and \ntreatment.   \n \nThe Project will provide employment opportunities during project construction, with an estimated 50% \n \n ", "  Appendix 14  59 \nto be filled by the poor for skilled and semi-skilled works. Project-related services, such as procurement of \nconstruction materials and equipment, will probably generate more employment. Persons that are \ntemporarily employed in construction will benefit from additional training and experience. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                   Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n \nThe poverty impact ratio has been calculated to illustrate the poverty impact of the Project. The proportion \naccruing to the poor has been estimated for all benefits allocated by the distribution analysis. Benefits to \ndomestic consumers have been allocated according to the proportion of WSS consumers that are poor. \nDomestic consumers will mainly be residents of the project area, and benefits are allocated using the \npoverty incidence in the project area. The poverty impact ratio is estimated to be 0.64. The Project is \nclassified as a general intervention, based on the proportion of poor among the beneficiaries, the \nproportion of benefits for the poor, and its positive impact on other poverty reduction projects.  \n \nUsing an absolute poverty line of AZM120,000 ($25.8)/person per month, 50% of the population is \nestimated to live in poverty. This line is based on the cost of a minimum food consumption basket, which \nguarantees a daily calorie intake of 2,200 kilocalories. Using a relative poverty line set at 60% of the \nmedian per capita consumption expenditure, which was AZM72,000 ($15.5), 17% of the population is \nestimated to live in extreme poverty.1 The extreme poor are mostly the elderly, the unemployed, the \ndisabled, pensioners, women-headed households, and internally displaced persons (IDPs). Persons in \nurban households have a higher risk of being poor than in rural households. Urban poverty rates are 55% \nvs 42% in rural areas; 60% of the poor live in urban areas. Poverty in secondary towns is slightly worse \nthan in larger cities (58% and 54%, respectively).2 According to the project household survey, 50% of the \npopulation in the project area is categorized as poor, with an average per capita income of about \nAZM116,000 ($24)/month. The higher risk of poverty in towns can be attributed to the importance of land \nand home produce as a safety net in rural areas. The rural population is relatively better off because of the \nvalue of produce consumed from the household\u2019s own agricultural plot or livestock. The survey showed \nthat 72% of household expenditures are for food. An average of 9% of household income is spent for utility \nitems. Gas and electricity are the largest utility items, and water bills account for 1%. But when coping \ncosts of obtaining a household\u2019s monthly water supply are taken into account, these expenditure (in cash \nand in kind) of poor households range from 8% to 12% of household income/month. The Project will lower \nthe effective costs, and even with tariff increases, the cost of meeting basic needs of 45 lpcd will be about \n2% to 4% of household income in 2008. \nC.  Participation Process \nStakeholder Analysis: Yes \n \nA household survey of 800 households, conducted under the project preparation technical assistance \n(TA), showed strong support for the Project. In each town, five focus group meetings were arranged that \nconcentrated on different stakeholder groups: representatives of the public sector, industry, \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), community leaders, and women\u2019s groups. The aim of these \nmeetings was to (i) assess local water-related problems and concerns; (ii) map out a pattern based on \ndemand specifications, and  (iii) enhance the participation and communication within each focus group, \nand among the participants, that would lead to devising solutions to their problems. Options for the \npotential WSS systems were discussed, as well as the principles of cost-benefit analysis. \n \nParticipatory Strategy: Yes \n \nThe Project will address direct beneficiary participation through (i) participation of municipalities on the \nboards of the joint stock companies (JSCs), (ii) representation of beneficiaries in Town Water Users \nAssociation (TWUA), (iii) consumer participation in public awareness and education campaigns, and (iv) \ndissemination of public relations information.   \n \n                                                 \n1  State Statistical Committee of Azerbaijan. 2001.

The JSCs will recognize the advocacy groups as important partners in achieving customer \nsatisfaction and effective service delivery. TWUAs will be in the form of civil society organizations; \nmembership will be open to all water and sewerage customers. The TWUAs will undertake public \ninformation campaigns on effective use of water and sewerage services. The associations will also \nrepresent, to the JSCs, concerns of members about service standards, quality, and tariffs. The \nCooperation Fund for the water sector will support TWUA establishment. \n \nD.   Gender Development \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nWomen, as the main household caretakers, are affected more than men by WSS failures. Women spend \nmuch time collecting water, and cleaning water for cooking, cleaning, and other household activities. \nFurthermore, women take care of children that suffer from waterborne diseases. Thus, any improvement in \nthe WSS systems has direct impact on the well-being of women.  \n \nThe Project focused on women from the initial phase of social analysis. One finding was that women are \nmore aware than men of water-related problems, and they have concrete suggestions on how to improve \nthe system. Women\u2019s preferences and suggestions have shaped the project design. Women have \nemphasized the importance of clean and reliable water through meetings with women NGOs in \nparticipatory focus group meetings, and random interviews. To ensure that women\u2019s participation and \ngender concerns are fully addressed, the Project will encourage that at least 30% of TWUA members be \nfemale. Thus, the Project aims to fulfill women\u2019s demands on clean and reliable water as a top priority. \nFurthermore, the awareness and education campaign on women water conservation would target an equal \nnumber of men and women, who would be community leaders for reducing water waste. NGOs targeted to \nwomen and water use will conduct special training. \n \nHas an output been prepared? No.  \n \nE.  Social Safeguards and Other Social Risks \n  Significant/  Strategy to Address Issues  Plan \nNot    Required \nSignificant/ \nNone  \nResettlement  None   The Project will require 120 km of sewerage pipes, 18 km of  No \ntrunk main, 170 km of water distribution network, and about \n100 hectares of land for stabilization ponds. All project \nactivities will take place within the existing pipeline alignment \nor on land owned by the municipal government.  No existing \nhousing, structures, shops, productive land or other cropland \nwill be affected. \nThe location and design of infrastructure has been carefully \nconsidered to avoid land acquisition and resettlement. \nDiscussion with officials, an inventory of location of pipelines \nand water and waste collection treatment status, visits to \nsites, and review of maps and engineering drawings indicate \nthat no resettlement is expected. No temporary taking of \nproductive land or structures is anticipated. Supplementary \nAppendix 14 summarizes land acquisition status. \n \n ", "  Appendix 14  61 \nAffordability   Not  There is high willingness to pay for reliable WSS services.  No \n  Significant  Household income and expenditure surveys in the project \narea show that payment for WSS services is about 1% or \nAZM4,400/month of household expenditure. The affordability \nanalysis shows that with forecast increases in charges, \naverage water and wastewater bills to meet basic needs of \n45 lpcd will increase to AZM19,038 by 2012. For a low-\nincome household, this will represent 2.3% to 4.2% of its \n2012 income, which is within the acceptable 5% limit. The \namount to be spent on water and wastewater bills under the \nProject is considerably less than the current average coping \ncosts in each town, which range from an average of 5.0% to \n8.5% of household income, and 7.2% to 12.7% of monthly \nincome for low-income households. To address the social \nimplications of the increases in WSS tariffs, an intense public \nawareness and education campaign will be undertaken \nthrough the management contractor activities, advisory TA, \nand the pilot and demonstrating activity grant assistance to \nsupport the TWUAs. \nLabor  Not   Although institutional reform will be introduced to improve  No \n  Significant  the management performance of the water company, few job \n  losses are expected. The social assessment shows that the \ntotal number of SuKanal employees in three towns is 116, of \nwhich about 30% are in managerial positions; most of these \nemployees will retire in the next 18 months. The new JSCs \nmay absorb the remaining managerial and technical \nemployees.  \n \nProject construction and operation will generate employment \nfor local beneficiaries. \nIndigenous  None  Most of the population in the project areas are Azeris; the  No \nPeople/ethnic  Project will not affect any ethnic minority.   \nminorities   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20041210114129+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20041116174543+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R244-04.doc", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 6.0 for Word", "Author": "aj3", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)", "SourceModified": "D:20041116033356"}}
