The  Government  of  Kazakhstan  requested  assistance  from  the  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB) to support the development and financing of urban infrastructure.1 In consultation \nwith stakeholders from the public and private sectors, ADB developed a policy and advisory \ntechnical assistance (TA) concept from May 2012 to January 2013, and approved the concept \npaper on 11 February 2013.2 Discussions were held with the Ministry of Economy and Budget \nPlanning, Kazakhstan Public\u2013Private Partnership Center (PPP Center), the Ministry of Regional \nDevelopment, and development partners. The TA builds on ongoing work that supports the \nimprovement of policy, regulatory, and institutional frameworks for private sector participation in \ninfrastructure in urban and other sectors of the country.3  This TA paper reflects the agreements \nreached with the government on the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, \ncost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Kazakhstan is characterized by an uneven distribution and low density of population. \nWith 54% of its more than 16 million population living in urban areas, it has one of the highest \nurban ratios in Central Asia. The total population of the 21 largest cities is 7 million or 43% of \nthe total population. The average population density is 5.8 people per square kilometer and is \none  of  the  lowest  in  the  world.  These  characteristics  pose  a  challenge  for  infrastructure \ndevelopment in the country. Infrastructure is unable to take advantages of densification and the \neconomies of scale that come with it. This, in turn, has implications for the cost of infrastructure \nand the willingness of the private sector to participate in its development. \n \n3.  Despite  being  a  middle-income  country,  Kazakhstan  needs  investment  in  urban \ninfrastructure development. The country\u2019s aging and dilapidated urban transport, water supply \nand sanitation, solid waste management, and district heating infrastructure requires substantial \ninvestment, estimated at more than $25 billion through 2040.4 Since the breakup of the former \nSoviet Union, the government has focused mainly on Astana and Almaty, creating a significant \nimbalance in terms of urban development. The government has devolved service delivery to \nlocal government units without adequate funding, apart from subsidies for operations and urgent \ninterventions to fund breakdowns. These subsidies are not shared equally among regional \ngovernments. Local governments, except for in Astana and Almaty, are not allowed to incur \n                                                \n1  The TA is included in the country operations business plan, 2012\u20132014 (ADB. 2012. Country Operations Business \nPlan: Kazakhstan, 2012\u20132014. Manila). The TA was originally titled Kazakhstan: Urban Infrastructure Development \nwhen financing was approved in July 2012 on a grant basis by the Urban Environmental Infrastructure Fund.  \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 19 February 2013. \n3  On 16 January 2013 the government announced that the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade would be \nreorganized into the Ministry of Economy and Budget Planning with the transfer of the budget planning functions \nfrom the Ministry of Finance and the function of creation of a favorable investment climate from the Ministry of \nIndustry and New Technologies. This reorganization will also result in the Agency for Construction, Housing and \nUtilities being reorganized into the Committee of Construction, Housing and Utilities and the transfer of it and the \nSectorial Development Department to the newly established Ministry of Regional Development, hence it is included \nas an implementing agency. \n4  Core urban sector investment requirements (water supply and sanitation, district heating network and related \nenergy efficiency, solid waste management, and urban mobility) until 2040 are estimated at  $12.8 billion\u2013 \n$14.3 billion. In addition, energy sector investment requirements for combined heat and power generation and \nrelated heat distribution (primarily for district heating purposes of the urban sector and industrial activities utilizing \nheat) are projected at $8.5 billion\u2013$10.7 billion until 2040. Extrapolating these numbers, direct investment needs for \nthe urban sector are about $14.3 billion and indirect investment needs in the energy sector that are benefiting \nurban sector infrastructure are about $10.7 billion. \n ", "2   \ndebt and are dependent on central government transfers for capital investments.  \n \n4.  The result is rapidly deteriorating urban infrastructure and services delivery outside the \ntwo main cities, particularly for the poor and women. Most of the water collection, treatment, and \ndistribution infrastructure inherited from the Soviet period is in physical disrepair. This has \nresulted in poor technical performance and quality of drinking water\u2013\u2013key factors that impact \npublic health. At least 10% of households do not have running water and about 20% of the \npopulation has no access to a proper sewage system. Estimates of nonrevenue water supply \narising from system losses range from 25% to 60%, but actual losses may be greater due to the \nlack of metering. A preliminary assessment suggests that all major and key intermediary cities \nhave  inefficient  solid  waste  management  systems,  which  are  unable  to  cope  with  rapid \nurbanization.  Supply  of  heat  to  multi-apartment  buildings  (district  heating)  during  the  cold \nseason is a basic human need in Kazakhstan\u2019s cold climate, yet the distribution and piping \nnetwork is outdated and inefficient and the technology is obsolete. Much of the heat produced is \nlost  due  to  leakages,  lack  of  proper  thermal  insulation,  and  inadequate  energy  efficiency \ninfrastructure in the housing stock. Greenhouse gas emissions from the heating system are \nestimated at 42 million\u201346 million tons of carbon dioxide per year, or almost 20% of total \nemissions. Women in urban areas particularly note problems with heating distribution and water \nsupply, and increasing tariffs combined with poor service. Improved urban infrastructure would \nenhance living standards for the poor and women, and increase time for productive activities.5 \n \n5.  Alternative sources of capital are available from local pension funds, the National Oil \nFund and the Sovereign Wealth Fund (Samruk Kazyna), and potentially from local and foreign \ndebt and equity markets. However, Kazakhstan has not yet found a strategy or a structure to \neffectively  mobilize  this  capital  for  urban  infrastructure  development.  The  lack  of  a \ncomprehensive  sector  strategy  and  weak  policy  and  regulatory  frameworks  for  urban \ninfrastructure investment result in major unmitigated risks. Investment instruments and markets \nthat enable capital from the private sector to be channeled efficiently into urban infrastructure \nwith a more optimal risk structure are not yet available.  \n \n6.  The government is supportive of private sector participation in developing and financing \npublic infrastructure through public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) and other structures. This is \nhighlighted by the creation of the PPP Center under the Ministry of Economic Development and \nTrade in 2008. The PPP Center had the original mandate to develop recommendations on \nlegislative norms, give methodological guidance, and conduct round tables and workshops for \ngovernment units responsible for public infrastructure. The PPP Center now has a substantially \nexpanded role, which includes structuring PPP projects, engaging consultants and experts, \ndeveloping bidding documents and draft contracts, conducting road shows, negotiating with \npotential concessionaires alongside the relevant sector or local government unit, and analyzing \napplications for funding and other support for PPPs from the state budget.  \n \n7.  A number of potential PPP projects have been developed as a result of this central \ngovernment support and local government efforts, but most have not yet reached financial \nclosure.  Concession  agreement  details  for  awarded  projects  were  not  disclosed.  The \ngovernment and private sector developers and their financiers had different expectations about \nhow much public sector participation was needed in the form of initial funding, viability gap \nsupport,  and  explicit  government  guarantees.  The  few  projects  that  were  implemented \ndefaulted, and claims were made against ill-defined government guarantees. Kazakhstan has \nan  existing  law  on  concessions  to  support  private  sector  participation  for  infrastructure \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: Kazakhstan, 2012\u20132016. Manila.  \n ", "  3 \ndevelopment and service delivery. However, the law in its current form is not comprehensive \nand has gaps that deter private sector investment.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n8.  Using select priority projects in two or three intermediary cities as demonstration projects, \nthe  TA  will  help  develop  a  well-documented  and  structured  program  of  private  sector \nparticipation and financing options. The TA will suggest methods to more efficiently utilize the \ncountry\u2019s large pool of capital held by local pension funds, the National Oil Fund, and other \ninvestors for urban infrastructure development. The related policy, legal, and regulatory gaps \narising from the assessments of these projects, but with wider sector implications, will be \nidentified.  The  TA  will  have  two  parts:  suggested  policy  improvements  to  make  urban \ninfrastructure investments less risky and therefore more attractive to private sector participation, \nand initial assessments of alternative approaches and financing modalities for the selected \npriority projects. The objective is to change the government\u2019s perception and understanding of \nhow it can (i) strengthen investor confidence while tangibly minimizing risks in some of the main \ninvestment phases and components of the priority development projects, and (ii) create the \nconditions needed to effectively mobilize private sector participation through debt, equity, and \nother means for financially and economically sustainable urban and other public infrastructure \ndevelopment. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be an improved enabling environment for private sector participation in \nselected priority urban infrastructure projects in intermediary cities in Kazakhstan. The outcome \nwill be a range of alternative financing modalities developed to enhance the government\u2019s ability \nto reduce the risk of priority urban infrastructure projects. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will start with a review of lessons identified by sector stakeholders with respect \nto  private  sector  participation  in  priority  environmental,  pro-poor  urban  infrastructure  and \nservices in Kazakhstan. This will include evaluation of existing and proposed policy, regulatory, \nand  institutional  frameworks  and  the  capacity  of  capital  markets  to  support  private  sector \nparticipation in urban infrastructure. It will also  cover an assessment of existing subsector \nassessments of water supply and sanitation, district heating, and solid waste management and \nrelated  projects.  Together,  these  will  be  used  as  the  basis  for  a  draft  advisory  paper  to \nrecommend strategy to ease constraints and improve the enabling environment for mobilizing \nprivate sector participation.  \n \n11.  An  advisory  panel  comprising  representatives  of  the  central  government,  selected \nintermediary cities, private sector participants, and other key stakeholders will be constituted. \nThe panel will serve as a platform and feedback mechanism for dialogue and discussion to \nimprove the recommendations of the advisory paper and create buy-in for them. In parallel with \ndialogue on the draft advisory recommendations, the subsector assessments will be discussed \nwith  the  central  government  and  local  government  units  to  identify  6\u20138  priority  urban \ninfrastructure  projects.  A  complete  financial  and  technical  prefeasibility  assessment  of  the \nidentified project will be conducted and alternative and innovative ownership, management, and \nfinancing structures will be prepared for each project. \n  \n ", "4   \n12.  Prefeasibility assessments of the alternative and/or innovative ownership, management, \nand financing structures will be used to undertake consultations with commercial banks in \nKazakhstan,  pension  funds  and  other  institutional  investors,  export  credit  agencies,  and \nmultilateral and bilateral development partners. They will focus on new and alternative forms of \nfinance,  credit  enhancement,  and  technical  and  capacity  building  support  to  mobilize \ncommercial cofinancing with a clear exit strategy for the government\u2019s initial investment. The \nidentified ownership, management, and financing structures and forms of support for mobilizing \ncommercial cofinancing for each priority project will feed into the advisory paper for stakeholder \ndiscussion, government consideration and endorsement. \n \n13.  Specific TA outputs will be (i) updated diagnostic assessments and advice on improving \npolicy,  regulatory,  and  institutional  frameworks  for  private  sector  participation  in  urban \ninfrastructure; (ii) a dialogue mechanism with various stakeholders; (iii) priority projects identified, \nand government readiness established to test new and/or alternative modalities for developing \nand  financing  these  projects  through  a  long-term  action  plan;  (iv)  alternative  ownership, \nmanagement, and financing structures proposed as options for each of the priority projects \nidentified;  and  (v)  methods  for  effectively  mobilizing  commercial  and  official  cofinancing \nestablished. \n \n14.  Active participation by key government and sector stakeholders is important for effective \nTA implementation. Continued government leadership of urban infrastructure development, as \narticulated  in  the  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132016,  is  expected  along  with  the \nimplementation of relevant policy, regulatory, and institutional reforms. Private sector interest in \ndeveloping infrastructure in intermediary cities is assumed to increase; and local capital market \ninvestors are expected to engage in identified investment opportunities. Potential risks are  \n(i)  central,  regional,  local,  and  municipal  governments  are  unable  to  reach \nconsensus;  \n(ii)  changes in government priorities may weaken urban investment options; and  \n(iii)  unaddressed systemic and structural risks in Kazakhstan could impact financial \nmarket  and  institutional  investor  participation  in  infrastructure.  These  will  be \nmanaged through  dialogue  with government, sector  stakeholders,  and  policy \nmakers during TA implementation. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,175,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Urban Environmental Infrastructure Fund6 under the Urban Financing Partnership \nFacility.7 The cost estimates and financing plan is in Appendix 2. The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff time, office space, secretarial assistance, \narrangements to meet with suitable stakeholders in the public and private sectors, and other in-\nkind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The  executing  agency  for  the  TA  will  be  the  Investment  Policy  Department  of  the \nMinistry of Economy and Budget Planning. The implementing agencies will be the Ministry of \nFinance, Kazakhstan PPP Center, and the Ministry of Regional Development (footnote 3). The \nPublic Management, Financial Sector, and Trade Division (CWPF) and Urban Development and \n                                                \n6  Contributor: the Government of Sweden. \n7  Administered by the Asian Development Bank. \n ", "  5 \nWater Division (CWUW) will jointly act as the focal point and coordinator of consultant inputs \nand  activities.  The  Transaction  Advisory  Services  Team  of  the  Central  and  West  Asia \nDepartment and Private Sector Operations Department will be actively consulted on relevant \nissues during TA implementation. Staff of the Kazakhstan Resident Mission will be involved in \nmonitoring project implementation activities. The TA will be implemented from June 2013 to May \n2015. \n \n17.  The TA will engage five international consultants for 25 person-months and five national \nconsultants  for  18  person-months  to  provide  policy  advice  and  technical  and  capacity \ndevelopment  assistance  during  TA  implementation.  In  accordance  with  the  cross-cutting \napproach of the TA, the consultant team will include experts in municipal infrastructure and \nurban  development  planning,  project  finance  and  capital  markets,  PPPs,  institutional \ndevelopment,  economics,  and  law.  The  skills  mix  and  qualifications  required  from  the \nconsultants are diverse, and difficult to source from any one consulting firm. ADB will engage \nthe  consultants  on  an  individual  basis  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time), and make disbursements in accordance with \nthe Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The \nTA team and implementing agencies will coordinate and assure the quality of consultant outputs. \nOutline terms of reference for consultants are provided in Appendix 3. The consultant team will \nsubmit (i) an inception report 3 weeks after the start of their services; (ii) interim progress \nreports at appropriate stages of TA implementation; (iii) a draft final report before the conclusion \nof the contract; (iv) a final report; and (v) activity-specific reports consistent with the design and \nmonitoring activities and outputs. \n \n18.  The TA findings and related policy and technical advisory interventions will be discussed \nwith stakeholders during a series of workshops and advisory panel discussions to inform, build \nownership for, and ensure functional understanding of the TA recommendations. The executing \nand implementing agencies and ADB staff will monitor the timeliness and quality of TA outputs. \nMissions of the project team to Kazakhstan will be organized on a semi-annual basis. The final \nevaluation of the project will be based on performance indicators outlined in the design and \nmonitoring framework. A final knowledge-sharing workshop will develop a feedback process for \ngood practices that are identified. Lessons will be disseminated to country stakeholders and \nADB staff through a seminar and a knowledge product in the form of a policy advisory note.   \n \nIV.
