The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been working closely with the South Asian \nAssociation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) to promote regional cooperation in South Asia. \nThe  memorandum  of  understanding  between SAARC  and  ADB,  signed  on  12 April  2004, \nprovided a framework for collaboration between the two institutions on activities to accelerate \nbroad-based economic growth and social development; promote cross-border movement of \ngoods, services, and people through regional cooperation; and promote institutional links with \nother regional cooperation initiatives.  \n2.  A regional technical assistance (TA) for Promoting South Asian Regional Economic \nCooperation1  has  been  assisting  the  SAARC  Secretariat  to  (i)  implement  priority  regional \ncooperation activities; (ii) enhance the capacity of the SAARC Secretariat, select entities and \nregional centers,2 and member states for effective planning, processing, and implementation of \nthe  key  regional  cooperation  agenda;  and  (iii)  prepare  activities  to  strengthen  cooperation \nbetween SAARC and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Two other TAs also \nassisted SAARC in organizing a workshop on the proposed SAARC Development Fund,3 and in \npreparing the energy sector dialogue.4 \n3.  During the SAARC secretary general\u2019s visit to ADB headquarters on 17\u201318 December \n2007, the SAARC delegation requested ADB to provide a follow-on umbrella TA5 to move the \nkey decisions and outcomes of SAARC summits forward and support the activities of the \nSAARC Secretariat. The meeting also served as a fact-finding mission. Although the TA will \nfocus on important areas\u2014including agriculture, energy, transport, and trade\u2014it was agreed \nthat the TA should have enough flexibility to include areas of emerging importance, such as \nenvironment and climate change, as the need arises. The proposed activities of the TA are in \nline with the operational objectives of the Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program for South \nAsia (2006\u20132008). The TA is included in the South Asia Regional Cooperation Operations \nBusiness Plan for 2009\u20132010.6  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  ADB is mandated by its charter to foster regional cooperation. Recognizing the vital role \nof regional cooperation and integration (RCI) in Asia\u2019s future, and in realizing its overall vision\u2014\nan Asia and the Pacific region free of poverty\u2014ADB formulated the RCI Strategy7 in 2006.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance for Promoting South Asian Regional Economic Cooperation. Manila (TA 6187-\nREG). The TA is expected to be completed in June 2009. \n2  There are 10 SAARC regional centers: Agriculture Center (Dhaka), Meteorological Research Center (Dhaka), \nTuberculosis  and  HIV/AIDS  Center  (Kathmandu),  Documentation  Center  (New  Delhi),  Information  Center \n(Kathmandu), Human Resources Development Center (Islamabad), Coastal Zone Management Center (Male), \nEnergy Center (Islamabad), Disaster Management Center (New Delhi), and Forestry Center (Thimpu). \n3  ADB. 2006.

Manila (TA 6368-REG). \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 7 October 2008.  \n6  ADB. 2008. South Asia Regional Cooperation Operations Business Plan 2009-2010. Manila.  \n7  ADB.  2006.  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration  Strategy.  Manila.  Cross-border  infrastructure,  trade  and \ninvestment cooperation, monetary cooperation, and cooperation on regional public goods are the four pillars of the \nstrategy. \n ", "2   \nADB\u2019s  long-term  strategic  framework  2008\u20132020  (Strategy  2020)8   also  emphasizes  the \nimportance of RCI. \n5.  Although South Asia is one of the fastest growing regions in Asia, its share of world \ntrade and share of intraregional to total trade remains much low compared to other regions. The \nregion\u2019s contiguity holds immense potential not only in increasing intraregional trade, but also in \nimproving the regular movement of people across borders and boundaries, and accessing the \nregion\u2019s densely-populated markets. Increased connectivity in South Asia could help propel \ninclusive growth.  \n6.  The 15th SAARC Summit9 reaffirmed the SAARC leaders\u2019 commitment to regional \nefforts to accelerate growth, social progress, and cultural development; and develop regional \nand subregional projects. The leaders urged quick implementation of the cooperative agenda on \nconnectivity, energy, agriculture and food security, trade, and environment; and called for the \nimplementation of regional agreements such as the South Asia Free Trade Area.  \n7.  ADB assisted SAARC in conducting the SAARC Regional Multimodal Transport Study \n(SRMTS),10 a detailed road map to improve regional transport connectivity.11 SAARC member \nstates have identified a number of subregional projects based on SRMTS, on which further work \nthrough high-level inter-governmental meetings will address the matters further.  \n8.  SAARC leaders have also emphasized the need to expeditiously develop renewable \nsources  of  energy,  such  as  hydropower;  conserve  energy;  and  introduce  energy  reforms, \nefficiency, and trade. Following the completion of the ongoing ADB-supported SAARC Regional \nEnergy  Trade  Study  (SRETS),  the  feasibility  studies  for  a  regional  energy  grid  and  other \nidentified potential projects will need to be undertaken.  \n9.  Recognizing the importance to regional trade of mutual recognition of standards and the \nharmonization of customs procedures, the 15th SAARC Summit signed an agreement on the \nEstablishment of a South Asia Regional Standards Organization. The implementation of the \nagreement will be vital in facilitating trade in South Asia.  \n10.  Cooperation  in  agriculture  and  food  security  has  also  intensified  in  the  past  year \nfollowing concerns about rapidly-rising commodity prices, including world food prices; declining \nstocks of cereals; concerns over productivity and natural resource base; more erratic weather \npatterns that may be a harbinger of climate change; and the fast-growing interdependence of \nmarkets for food and energy. As highlighted during the 15th SAARC Summit, SAARC member \nstates are now cooperating more actively to promote food security and enhance agricultural \nproductivity and sustainability, including timely responses to the emerging trends in international \nand domestic food markets.12  \n                                                 \n8   ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank 2008\u20132020. \nManila. Strategy 2020 commits, by 2020, at least 30% of ADB operations in support of subregional and regional \ndevelopment.  The  three  complementary  strategic  agendas  are  inclusive  growth,  environmentally-sustainable \ngrowth, and regional integration. \n9  Held on 2\u20133 August 2008 in Colombo, Sri Lanka. \n10 Supported by the regional TA for Promoting South Asian Regional Economic Cooperation (TA 6187-REG).   \n11 The study was endorsed at the 14th SAARC Summit in New Delhi in 2007. Subsequently, the study has been \nextended to cover Afghanistan and a model agreement on transport and transit for SAARC has been prepared. \n12 The Colombo Statement on Food Security guided agriculture ministers of SAARC to establish a short- to medium-\nterm regional strategy and a set of projects that would promote: increased food production, investment in \nagriculture and agro-based industries, research on sustainable land use and agricultural technology, sharing of ", "  3\n11.  With a view to implement the region\u2019s cooperation agenda, SAARC member states are \nincreasingly focusing on acquisition and exchange of the necessary knowledge and skills to \neffectively implement regional priorities. SAARC also acknowledged the importance of sharing \nof successful experiences with other relevant regional cooperation initiatives.   \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The expected impact of the TA is enhanced regional cooperation and integration in \nSouth Asia. The TA\u2019s envisaged outcome is enhanced capacity of the SAARC Secretariat, \nSAARC  entities,  and  government  entities  of  SAARC  member  states,  as  approved  by  the \nSAARC mechanisms, to effectively plan and implement regional cooperation activities. The TA \nexpects to promote the effective sharing of information and experiences, and develop capacity \nin support of regional cooperation. \n13.  The  TA  will  focus  on  institutional  strengthening  and  have  the  following  main \ncomponents:  (i)  initiatives  for  regional  food  security;  (ii)  trade,  economic,  and  financial \ncooperation; (iii) capacity development programs for SAARC entities, including select regional \ncenters, as approved by the SAARC member states and training programs; (iv) programs to \nsupport  institutional  links  with  other  regional  organizations;  and  (v)  technical  and  logistics \nsupport.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA will focus on the following priority areas: agriculture, including food security; \nenergy; transport; and trade. The TA is designed to be flexible to allow for the inclusion of \nactivities of other emerging important sectors or thematic areas (e.g., environment), or those \nsupporting the resolutions of inter-ministerial meetings. The SAARC Secretariat and ADB will \nhold periodic consultation meetings to discuss and agree on priorities, milestones, and details of \nactivities to be implemented in an agreed timeframe. A joint SAARC\u2013ADB annual work program \nreflecting and outlining these agreements could also be formulated for the approval of SAARC \nhigher bodies.  \n15.  The TA will support SAARC initiatives for regional food security. With assistance from \nthe Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), senior policy makers and technical experts from \nagriculture and food ministries, and leading research entities have prepared initial proposals for \na program of regional cooperation to address the problems of (i) low and stagnating productivity \nin both marginal and productive areas of the region, (ii) high pre- and post-harvest crop losses \nand low value addition, (iii) degradation of soil and water resources, (iv) lack of biosecurity and \nfood safety measures, and (v) inadequate human resource capacity in the areas of food safety \nand  trade.  The  TA  will  prepare  a  set  of  detailed  project  proposals,  with  associated \nimplementation plans, cost estimates, and possible financing arrangements. \n16.  On trade, economic and financial cooperation, the TA will support: (i) a study on the \nregional economic integration in SAARC, its current extent and recommendations for further \ndeepening; (ii) development of institutional framework for data collection on trade in services, \nincluding capacity building; (iii) a study on codification of variations in the level of development \n                                                                                                                                                          \nbest practices in food procurement and distribution, and management of climate and disease risks in agriculture. \nThe summit directed that the SAARC Food Bank be urgently operationalized.  \n ", "4   \nof capital markets in SAARC member states. Through this support, the TA will assist in the \nformulation of policy agenda and preparation of regional investment projects.  \n17.  SAARC-approved  knowledge  management  activities\u2014such  as  workshops  and \nconferences involving representatives from the Governments and SAARC Secretariat on one \nhand, and other stakeholders, as appropriate\u2014could also be organized to facilitate discussions \non regional cooperation. These activities could be used to disseminate information on and \ngenerate support for regional cooperation projects, as agreed.  \n18.  The TA will support capacity development of select SAARC entities, including regional \ncenters,13 as requested by the member states. Capacity building and the training needs will be \nassessed by SAARC mechanisms. The specific programs will be developed in consultation with \nSAARC Secretariat and concerned entities and select regional centers to ensure that they are \nneed-based and value added. Training programs could be designed based on the successful \ntraining modules of other regional cooperation initiatives. A mix of case study, experience \nsharing, on-site visit, and lectures will be used for the training. Other stakeholders could be \ninvited to participate in selected training programs, as appropriate. \n19.  The  TA  will  help  build  the  institutional  links  between  SAARC  and  other  regional \norganizations, as approved by SAARC member states, through joint meetings, field visits, and \nother  knowledge  management  activities.  Such  links  would  not  only  enable  the  sharing  of \nexperiences and lessons from each other, but would also promote economic activities among \nregions. This would ultimately enhance economic gains for all partners.   \n20.  The  regional  cooperation  advisor  will  prepare  semi-annual  progress  reports  to  be \ndistributed to the SAARC Secretariat. Mutually agreed appropriate documents related to the TA, \ncould be disseminated or posted on the ADB website and the SAARC website, as appropriate.  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n21.  The TA cost is estimated at $1.5 million and will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTA funding program. The SAARC Secretariat and SAARC member states will provide in-kind \ncontributions.14 The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are shown in Appendix 2.  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  a  24-month  period  beginning  March  2009  until \nFebruary 2011. ADB will be the executing agency in consultation with the SAARC Secretariat. A \nsteering  committee  comprising  representatives  from  the  SAARC  Secretariat  and  ADB  will \noversee overall project implementation. Specific components will be jointly implemented by ADB \nand SAARC Secretariat, and where required, through SAARC entities including select regional \ncenters. Given the priority attached to food security, the initiatives for regional food security will \nbe implemented by the SAARC Agriculture Center (SAC) under the overall guidance of the \nSAARC Secretariat.15 The component on trade, economic, and financial cooperation will be \nimplemented through the SAARC Secretariat. The technical and logistics support component \n                                                 \n13 Selection of the SAARC entities and the regional centers will be agreed with SAARC Secretariat and approved by \nthe member states.  \n14Including  officials\u2019  time,  resource  persons,  and  office  space  as  agreed  with  SAARC  Secretariat  during \nimplementation. \n15 The Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Social Services Division of ADB\u2019s South Asia Department will coordinate \nthe implementation of the component on initiatives for regional food security.

A  certain  level  of  flexibility  will  be  required  to  allow  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to accommodate SAARC Secretariat\u2019s requests that may arise during \nthe finalization of the annual SAARC\u2013ADB work program and/or during the TA implementation. \n \nA.   Initiatives for Regional Food Security  \n2.  With support from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), SAARC has prepared \nproject concept notes (PCNs) to address five thematic problem areas in agriculture: (i) low and \nstagnating productivity; (ii) high pre- and post- harvest losses, and low value addition; (iii) over-\nexploitation and degradation of natural resources (e.g., land, water, biodiversity); (iv) lack of bio-\nsecurity and food safety measures; and (v) human resource capacity in the areas of food safety, \nquality and standards, and trade. With considerable ownership of this work by the participating \nSAARC specialists, the PCNs can be fully developed and detailed in order to become feasible \nproject proposals for submission to higher SAARC authorities. The objectives and scope of the \nprojects need to be sharply focused. Some activities proposed in the PCNs parallel existing \nprograms of agricultural research, training, and extension undertaken at the country level, so the \nfull proposals need to show how these activities will be integrated and what additional benefits a \nregionally-coordinated approach will bring as compared to the existing country-level programs. \nThe project cost estimates need to be refined. Institutional arrangements for implementation \nmust  be  determined  and  agreed  upon  by  the  collaborating  institutions  and  their  parent \nministries. Each PCN includes a logical framework, but the outcome and impact indicators, \ndeliverables, and monitoring systems must be updated based on the above refinements and in \nrelation to attributable project outputs.   \n \n3.  The TA will support the additional work that SAARC will undertake to prepare proposals \nfor consideration by SAARC leaders, and possibly by the development partners, for financing. \nThe key outputs will be a set of detailed proposals\u2014with associated implementation plans, cost \nestimates, social and environmental safeguards (if needed), and financing arrangements\u2014\nincluding the indicative contributions of ADB and other donors, if any. In addition, the TA will \nbuild capacity within the implementing agency, the SAARC Agriculture Center (SAC), which has \nrecently been given an enhanced mandate to facilitate and support knowledge dissemination \nand the implementation of collaborative agricultural research and development projects in the \nSAARC region. The outcome will be a stronger regional agricultural cooperation network and \nconsensus  on  a  detailed  and  well-coordinated  program  of  investment  and  capacity \ndevelopment. If successful, the ultimate impacts will be improved farm incomes, better farm \npractices, and more sustainable natural resource management, contributing to improved food \nsecurity in the SAARC region by way of enhanced subregional cooperation and trade. The \ninitiatives for regional food security are expected to commence in March 2009 and should be \ncompleted by October 2009. \n \n ", "10   Appendix 3         \n4.  Key activities of the food security initiatives will include: \n(i)  preparing 7\u201310 detailed project proposals on regional food security, with \nresource contributions committed by participating research institutions at country \nlevel; \n(ii)  organizing regional consultations, workshops, and other networking activities with \nparticipating research institutions for the purpose of project formulation; \n(iii)  organizing multi-stakeholder field visits for data collection and project formulation;  \n(iv)  preparing a medium-term capacity development action plan;  and \n(v)  organizing and participating in consultation visits to Asia-based regional and \ninternational agriculture institutions, among others, to support SAC capacity \ndevelopment planning. \n \n5.
