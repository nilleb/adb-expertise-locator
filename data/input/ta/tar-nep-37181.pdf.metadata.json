As agreed on with the Government of Nepal during the Country Program Mission in April \n2003,  a  nonlending  program  on  Strengthening  Performance-Based  Management  has  been \nincluded in the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country program for Nepal for 2003.1 This \nprogram will provide technical assistance (TA) support to implement a critical component of the \nADB-assisted Governance Reform Program (GRP).2  During the Nepal 2003 Country Program \nMission,  the  Government  and  ADB  agreed  that  progress  in  establishing  processes  for \nperformance-based management in key ministries would be used as a monitoring indicator to \nassess Nepal\u2019s lending scenario.  \n \n2.  A TA Fact-Finding Mission was fielded from 14 to 24 July 2003. The Mission reached an \nunderstanding with the Government on the objectives, scope, costs, financing, implementation \narrangements, and terms of reference for consulting services under the TA. The TA framework \nis in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The Government has prioritized governance reform as critical for economic development \nand poverty reduction. The Tenth Plan, which is also the Government\u2019s poverty reduction \nstrategy paper, has adopted a four-pillar poverty reduction strategy, including good governance. \nA number of government policies, including recent budget speeches, a report of the Public \nExpenditure  Review  Commission,  and  several  administrative  reform  commissions  have \nstressed  the  need  for  public  management  to  be  more  pro-public,  efficient,  transparent, \nresponsive, and accountable. ADB has supported the Government\u2019s governance reform effort \nsince 1998. A TA3 was approved in December 1998 to prepare an action plan on civil service \nreform. A subsequent TA4 helped the Government start its long-term reform program and further \nassess  options  and  priorities  to  implement  the  reform  program.  The  TA  also  helped  the \nGovernment implement the first stages of the policy-based GRP to meet the program loan\u2019s \nfirst-tranche conditions.  \n \n4.  GRP was approved on 27 November 2001. Its overall goal is to establish a civil service \nthat is result and people oriented and gender responsive, and will help achieve higher economic \ngrowth and reduce poverty. The objectives of GRP are to (i) develop the Government\u2019s capacity \nto lead and undertake the governance reform agenda, (ii) improve the efficiency of the civil \nservice,  (iii)  improve  governance  and  reduce  government  corruption,  (iv)  enhance  the \ncompetence  and  motivation  of  civil  servants,  and  (v)  establish  processes  to  improve \nperformance in key ministries. The Executing Agency for the program loan is the Ministry of \nGeneral Administration (MOGA), with the administrative reform committee5 (ARC) chaired by \nthe minister for general administration and with key government officials as members, to guide \nGRP implementation. The Government also established five reform units to lead and drive the \nreform program: governance reform coordination unit (GRCU) in MOGA; efficiency unit in the \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 28 July 2003.  \n2  ADB. 2001.

Formulating an Action Plan on Civil Service Reforms. Manila ($630,000).  \n4  ADB. 2001. Institutional Support for Governance Reforms. Manila. (TA was approved on 18 January 2001 and the \nconsultants [PDP Pty. Ltd. Australia] were fielded in May 2001. PDP Australia completed its service in December \n2002.) \n5  Chaired  by  the  minister  of  MOGA,  with  members  consisting  of  the  secretaries  of  the  National  Planning \nCommission, Prime Minister\u2019s Office, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Law and Justice, and concerned line \nministries, and with the MOGA secretary as member secretary.  ", "2 \nMinistry  of  Finance  (MOF);  and  a  change  unit  each  in  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and \nCooperatives (MOAC), Ministry of Education and Sports (MOES), and Ministry of Health (MOH).  \n \n5.  Three TA packages were proposed6 to implement GRP: (i) package 1: core program \nreform;  (ii)  package  2:  civil-society  support  for  the  reform  measures;  and  (iii)  package  3: \nprogram  monitoring  and  reporting.  During  GRP  loan  negotiation  in  November  2001,  ADB \nagreed that the Government would secure funding from other donor agencies to finance the \npackages,  given  ADB\u2019s  TA  resource  constraints.  ADB  has  since  continued  to  help  the \nGovernment  seek  cofinancing  from  bilateral  donor  agencies.  The  Swiss  Agency  for \nDevelopment and Cooperation (SDC) has confirmed funding support for packages 2 and 3, with \nPro-Public, a local nongovernment organization (NGO) contracted to implement the two TAs \nsince July 2003.  \n \n6.  Package 1 comprises five reform components that encompass the five GRP objectives. \nThe Government has been implementing a number of these reform components based on \nproposals developed by TA (footnote 4). The Government is also seeking donor support to \nimplement  other  reform  components  of  this  package.  For  example,  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) Mainstreaming Gender Equity Programme has supported \ngender-mainstreaming  programs.  The  United  Kingdom\u2019s  Department  for  International \nDevelopment (DFID) has indicated an interest in supporting programs on gender and exclusion. \nMOGA and DFID held several meetings recently to draw up terms of reference to prepare a \nproject document. However, the Government has not been able to secure TA support for the \nperformance improvement component of package 1 despite requests to DFID and United States \nAgency for International Development (USAID). Implementing policy measures and activities of \nthis reform component has been delayed and, as a result, GRP implementation is suffering. Any \nfurther delay could seriously undermine the program\u2019s intended benefits. Reform in performance \nmanagement is an integral part of GRP since it is concerned with delivery of improved services \nto citizens and, therefore, is directly related to making Nepal\u2019s civil service more result and \npeople oriented. Reform in performance management was sequenced toward the end of the \nfirst phase of GRP (early 2003), as other reform initiatives7 under the program were expected to \ncomplement the introduction of a performance management system. Since SDC\u2019s TA (para. 5) \nwill  mainly  focus  on  building  stakeholder  support  for  reform  initiatives  under  performance \nmanagement, the policy measures and activities under performance improvement component \nneed to be implemented immediately. Disbursement of GRP\u2019s second and third loan tranches is \nlinked  to  effective  implementation  of  a  number  of  policy  measures  and  actions  under  the \nperformance management component.  \n \n7.    GRP\u2019s design envisaged that a subsequent TA would complement the preliminary work \ninitiated by TA on performance management (footnote 4). The TA consultants organized a \nnumber of consultative workshops8 for members of the reform units, and helped MOGA, MOAC, \nand MOES develop performance improvement plans, including service delivery indicators. The \nconsultants developed a model9 for performance-based management in the civil service and an \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nKingdom of Nepal for the Governance Reform Program. Manila. \n7  MOGA  has  proposed  a  number  of  related  reforms  such  as  a  merit-based  promotion  system  centered  on \nperformance, transparency, and accountability; and reforms in transfers, grievance procedures, and issues of \ninequality. The ARC is expected to review these soon. \n8  Several  workshops have been organized on a number of themes: development of performance indicators, \nmanagement model, framework for improvement, improvement fund, and improvement plan.  \n9  Integrated performance-based planning and management model.  ", "    3 \noperations manual.10 The reform units considered the model to be conceptually complex and \ndifficult to understand and implement without further guidance. Training opportunities provided \nby the TA were considered insufficient given the complexity of the subject and limited capacity \nof staff. The impact of capacity-building efforts was largely lost since the members of reform \nunits  were  frequently  transferred.  Performance  plans  of  MOAC  and  MOES  could  not  be \nimplemented because GRCU and efficiency unit11 did not provide counterpart funds on time. \nTherefore, adequate capacity building and training are needed for the assistance program, and \nclose guidance/mentoring are required during development and implementation of performance \nplans, together with committed budget and reform unit staff who will not be transferred.  \n \n8.  During  the  semiannual  GRP  Loan  Review  Mission,  fielded  in  February  2003,  the \nGovernment stated that implementing performance management reforms was difficult given the \ninadequate understanding of performance management, service delivery standards, and funds. \nThe  Government  requested  further  consultancy  support  in  this  area,  while  the  Mission \nrecognized that further work would be difficult without additional expatriate consultancy support.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  The TA\u2019s objective is to help the Government implement GRP\u2019s reform component to \nimprove the quality, efficiency, and access of services provided by key ministries. The TA\u2019s \npurpose is to establish a system to develop, adopt, communicate, and monitor performance \ntargets in selected service and central ministries, with a first set of targets in place by the end of \nthe TA. It will deliver a performance management system, performance improvement plans, \nperformance improvement fund, and service standards. Emphasis will be placed on building \nskills, confidence, and change leadership in GRCU, efficiency unit, and the change units in the \nthree pilot ministries. The TA will also help the Government meet second- and third-tranche \nconditions under GRP\u2019s performance improvement component, as specified in its policy matrix. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA\u2019s central focus will be to establish and implement the culture and processes \nrelated  to  performance-based  management,  and  demonstrate  budget  incentives,  efficiency \ndividends, and benefits in terms of improved outcomes. The TA will support three service \ndelivery ministries (MOAC, MOES, and MOH) and two central ministries (MOF and MOGA), and \nreview the work initiated on performance management by TA (footnote 4). GRCU and efficiency \nunit will develop management performance plans and transfer new procedures and capacities to \nsupport the three pilot line ministries. The TA will provide GRCU, efficiency unit, and the change \nunits with customized training and mentoring to ensure that leadership and technical skills are \navailable to develop and implement management and performance plans. Management and in-\nservice training will be provided to develop the skills needed to analyze problems and design \nsolutions to help improve ministry performance as specified in the performance improvement \nplans.  \n \n11.  The TA will help MOAC, MOES, and MOH develop and implement annual performance \nimprovement plans, including client service standards. The Government will work in partnership \n                                                 \n10  The manual focused on developing performance measurements and indicators, and on producing a performance \nmanagement plan.  \n11  Although the Government allocated Rs6 million for GRP activities in last year\u2019s budget, the funds requested to \nimplement performance-based management were not made available on time to the two line ministries.  ", "4 \nwith Pro-Public (an NGO contracted under TA package 2) to make the public aware of, and to \nsolicit broad support and advocacy for, the performance plans. These will include performance \nindicators for programs under improvement to establish accountability and lead to efficiency \nsavings.  The  annual  plans  will  include  a  review  process  to  identify  further  performance \nimprovements and service quality standards. The possibility of retaining efficiency savings will \nbe a key feature of plans to facilitate reform and provide incentives for the ministries. To access \nthese savings, a performance improvement fund12 will be introduced in a phased manner and \nprovided  to  ministries  that  successfully  introduce  performance  improvement  plans.  The \nperformance fund will be used for skills development, improved business processes, engaging \nspecialist staff, and equipment purchase. The TA will help MOF and MOGA design institutional \narrangements, modalities, and procedures to implement such a fund.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $330,000 equivalent, of which the foreign exchange cost is \n$180,000  and  the  local  currency  is  $150,000  equivalent.  The  Government  has  requested \n$275,000, to be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program to cover the entire \nforeign exchange cost of $180,000 and $95,000 equivalent of the local currency costs. The \nGovernment has agreed to contribute the remaining local currency cost of $55,000 equivalent to \nprovide office accommodation and travel, counterpart staff support, facilities for seminars and \nmeetings, and other administrative expenses. Details of cost estimates and the financing plan \nare in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  MOGA will be the Executing Agency for the TA. GRCU will coordinate and monitor TA \nactivities, and report to the ARC through the MOGA secretary. GRCU, efficiency unit, and the \nchange units will direct and support reform in their respective ministries. The Government will \nprovide progress reports on TA implementation in line with reporting arrangements of GRP. Pro-\nPublic will independently assess the impact of service delivery efforts based on consumer \nsurveys (under TA package 2).  \n \n14.  The TA will be implemented over 15 months, from December 2003 to February 2005, \nand have a total of 21 person-months of consultancy: 6 international and 15 domestic, with \ninternational expertise input provided in two phases. The consultancy team, with expertise in \nperformance  management,  will  include  one  international  and  one  domestic  consultant;  the \ninternational consultant will lead the team. The international consultant will have extensive \nexperience in developing civil service performance improvement schemes. The consultants will \nbe recruited on an individual basis. The consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  by  ADB  and  its  Borrowers  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The outline \nterms of reference of the consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n15.  The consultants will submit five brief progress reports: an inception report no later than 4 \nweeks after fielding the consultants, a progress report in the fourth month, a midterm progress \nreport in the seventh month, a progress report in the eleventh month, a draft final report in the \n                                                 \n12  The Government informed the Mission that this fund will not be used to finance performance-related pay to \nindividual staff as incentives. The performance improvement fund will be used for various activities related to \nservice improvement, as envisaged in GRP (para. 86 of ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President \nto the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Kingdom of Nepal for the Governance Reform Program. \nManila). The Mission accepted the Government\u2019s position.  ", "    5 \nfourteenth month to be reviewed by all stakeholders, and a final report to be submitted in the \nfifteenth month. Three workshops will be organized to share and disseminate the consultants\u2019 \nquarterly progress reports.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of Nepal in an amount \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $275,000 for the purpose of Strengthening Performance-Based \nManagement, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nGoal       \nImproved quality,  Improved  Client satisfaction \nefficiency, and  government services  surveys by Pro-Public \naccess of  provided by well-  \ngovernment services  trained civil service  Annual Governance \nprovided by  Reform Program reports \nministries of \n \nagriculture and \ncooperatives \n(MOAC), education \nand sports (MOES), \nand health (MOH) \n \nPurpose       \nEstablish a system to  Improved quality,  To be identified by TA  The government is \ndevelop, adopt,  efficiency, and  consultants (e.g., client  committed to reform. \ncommunicate, and  access of services  satisfaction surveys, \nStaff are able and \nmonitor performance  provided by selected  annual reports of \nmotivated to provide \ntargets in selected  ministries;

Scope of Services \n1.  The scope of service of the consultants (6 person-months of international expertise and \n15 person-months of domestic expertise) requires expertise in performance management. An \ninternational consultant with expertise in introducing performance management schemes in the \ncivil service will lead the consultancy team since experience and capacity in implementing \nperformance management systems is limited in Nepal. The consultants will assess the skill \nlevels and needs of line ministry personnel and management in relation to preparation of \nperformance improvement plans (for the ministries of agriculture and cooperatives, health, and \neducation  and  sports),  and  will  provide  direction  on  covering  areas  directly  relevant  to \nproduction of the plan. The consultants will provide training, produce the plans, and facilitate \nimplementation.  The  consultants  will  also  help  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  Ministry  of \nGeneral Administration (MOGA), and three line ministries design institutional frameworks and \noperating procedures to establish and use the performance improvement fund. The consultants \nwill  help  the  staff  of  the  governance  reform  coordination  and  efficiency  units  develop \nmanagement improvement plans that cover the critical operations and business processes of \nMOGA and MOF, respectively, in addition to support to line ministries. The consultants will help \nthe Government meet the second- and third-tranche loan conditions under the performance \nimprovement component of the Governance Reform Program (GRP), as specified in its policy \nmatrix;  therefore,  the  consultants  will  need  to  comprehend  GRP\u2019s  principles  and  policy \nframework. The consultants will primarily facilitate adoption of a process consultancy approach, \nenabling reforms to be carried out by government personnel. The performance management \nconsultants will report to the secretary of MOGA.  \n \nB.  International Consultants  \n \n2.  The consultants will do the following: \n \n(i)  Jointly with the Government review the TA (footnote 4) consultants\u2019 work on \nperformance  management  and  identify  areas  of  work  that  can  be  further \ndeveloped and implemented. \n(ii)  Collaboratively assess competencies and strengths of line ministry management \nand staff to prepare and implement performance improvement plans oriented to \nimproved service delivery (including service delivery to remote ethnic minority \ncommunities) against set standards. \n(iii)  Based on the assessment, conduct training sessions to improve skill levels, and \nproduce performance improvement plans (to include service delivery to minor \ncommunities) based on the agreed-on formats. \n(iv)  Coach, mentor, and guide line ministry personnel in performance improvement \nplan  implementation,  including  development  and  introduction  of  service \nstandards. \n(v)  Help MOF and MOGA staff develop formal management improvement plans. \n(vi)  Advise and guide MOF, MOGA, and the line ministries in implementing plans, \nparticularly in overcoming obstacles, and using new management techniques, \nbusiness processes, and formal reporting. \n(vii)  Help MOF, MOGA, and the line ministries establish guidelines to create and use \nthe performance improvement fund.
