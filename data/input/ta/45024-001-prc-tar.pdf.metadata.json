INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  has  asked  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) to support the \ndevelopment of a multimodal passenger transport policy based on international best practice. \nDuring the fact-finding mission, ADB and the government reached an understanding on the \nimpact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, costs, financing arrangements, and \nterms of reference for consulting services for the TA.1 The design and monitoring framework is \nin Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The increasing size of cities and growth of intercity travel have led to increases in the \naverage length of passenger journeys in the PRC. Longer trips also mean that an increasing \nnumber of journeys will be multimodal, involving use of more than one mode to complete a \nsingle trip, and requiring transfers between modes. In passenger transportation, multimodal \njourneys are quite common and a multimodal transport hub (or transport interchange) is defined \nas a place where passengers change transport modes. This can be at train stations, rapid \ntransit stations, bus stops, tram stops, airports, or anywhere that two or more of these modes \ncome together. These transfer points play an important role in transportation, and can become a \nbottleneck if not adequately developed. Well-designed and integrated multimodal passenger \ntransport hubs are therefore needed to reduce inefficiencies, reduce travel times, and increase \ntraveler convenience.  \n \n3.  A good passenger transport system is often built around a high-capacity rail system. \nOther  modes  such  as  buses,  taxis,  and  nonmotorized  vehicles  are  typically  used  when \ntransporting passengers between a train station and their home or working place. Thus the \ninterchange between trains and other modes is often inevitable in a well-functioning public \ntransportation network. Short interchange times are consequently a very important factor in \nmaking public transportation a viable alternative for personal travel.  \n \n4.  In the PRC, the high-speed rail network has been rapidly expanded. However, railway \nstations for the new lines are often located far from city centers, and poorly integrated with the \ncity transport systems. Thus, while the high-speed rail network will facilitate faster intercity or \nsuburban travel, the stations and surrounding areas must be efficiently linked to the existing city \nwith  well-designed  multimodal  transport  infrastructure  and  high-quality  integrated  public \ntransport services. This will ensure a reduction in transport costs, increase travel opportunities \nand regional accessibility to jobs and services, and promote economic development and poverty \nreduction.   \n \n5.  A key challenge is how to assess the performance of multimodal passenger transport \nhubs. Presently the PRC has no technical standards or specifications to guide the development \nof high-quality multimodal hubs. The result has been urban transport systems with relatively \ninconvenient transfers, longer trip times, and higher transport costs than would be achieved with \nbetter coordinated planning and integrated multimodal transfer facilities. Simple, but important, \nvariables are needed to assess the performance of hubs. For instance, \u201ctime of transfer\u201d is a \nkey variable that indicates the time needed to transfer across modes. A traveling passenger will \nusually not accept an excessively long waiting time at a mode change point and considerable \ndelays during transfers may induce shifts to private vehicles. Hence terminal layouts can be \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 3 October 2011. \n ", "2   \nassessed using transfer times as a performance measure. This would ensure designs that \nfacilitate passenger convenience by focusing on short walking distances and easily accessible \nwaiting areas. Such performance measures are needed to guide the design and development of \nmultimodal hubs. \n \n6.  In  the  PRC,  lack  of  institutional  coordination  is  another  barrier  to  developing  good \nmultimodal  hubs.  The  planning,  implementation,  and  management  of  key  transport \ninfrastructure and systems is typically carried out by agencies operating independently. For \nexample, new railway stations are designed and built by the Ministry of Railways. Land is \nusually provided in a nearby but separate location for local or intercity bus companies to \nconstruct bus stations. The independent facilities are generally well designed and constructed, \nbut often lack efficient physical connections between modes, have limited information and fare \nsystem integration, and tend to cluster distinct mode-specific hubs rather than combine them in \nsingle multimodal facilities. This results in poor service for passengers, unsafe and congested \npedestrian  movements,  and  consumes  too  much  urban  land\u2014inhibiting  land  development \nopportunities. \n \n7.  The main goals of multimodal transport hub design can be summarized as follows: \n \n(i)  Provide an efficient point of transfer between transport modes to streamline and \noptimize overall transport network functionality. In the absence of transit hubs, \npublic transport tends to have less coverage and significant route overlaps and \nredundancy, leading to increasing road congestion and reducing the economic \nviability of public transport operations.  \n(ii)  Provide  quality  service  for  passengers  to  make  public  transportation  an \nappealing option. Given the choice, many people would prefer a nonstop journey \nfrom  door-to-door  by  a  private  vehicle.  A  high-quality  hub,  providing  a \ncomfortable and seamless transfer experience, is a vital ingredient for making \npublic transport an attractive alternative to using private vehicles. This will reduce \nenergy  consumption  and  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  and  provide  a  more \nsustainable economic basis for public transport operators.  \n(iii)  Maximize  the  commercial  opportunity  within  the  hub  to  provide  additional \nrevenue  sources  to  contribute  to  meeting  the  cost  of  hub  operation  and \nmaintenance. The high-traffic flow is attractive to many types of commercial \noperators and, if properly designed and managed, can generate income without \ncompromising operations or quality of service. \n(iv)  Integrate with the surrounding urban area to maximize the pedestrian catchment \narea and encourage transit-oriented development. \n \n8.  The TA focuses on enhancing the efficiency and appeal of public transport systems and \nmultimodal integration; this fits well with ADB\u2019s Sustainable Transport Initiative, which provides \nnew directions to promote more environmentally and socially sustainable transport systems in \nline with Strategy 2020.2 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n9.  The TA will assist the government with the planning and implementation of multimodal \npassenger  hubs  in  urban  areas.  It  will  support  development  of  a  multimodal  passenger \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2008.

The TA will \ndevelop  guidelines  and  recommendations  to  support  the  appraisal  and  development  of \nmultimodal passenger hubs with the aim of providing fast and efficient transfers as well as \ncomfortable and convenient facilities. It will examine issues of integrating land use in hub \ndesigns  and  the  potential  for  realizing  the  land  value  gains  and  commercial  spinoffs  for \nenhancing the financial viability of multimodal hub projects. The TA will focus on bringing \ntogether examples of best practice multimodal hubs from around the PRC and internationally, \nidentifying key features of best-practice hubs, and determining their impact on system and \nfinancial performance. It will publish detailed guidelines on best practices for different types of \nhubs; and prepare plans for a scheme to provide incentives for cooperation among all modes \nand stakeholders. \n \n10.  The TA will specifically focus on hubs being developed around railway stations since \nsuch hubs represent the major area of opportunity and expansion in the PRC. The TA will \nexplore the most efficient ways of achieving integration between modes such as bus, taxi, urban \nrail, intercity rail, and nonmotorized transport. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the TA will be improved efficiency and usability of multimodal hubs in the \nPRC.  The  outcome  is  that  policy  recommendations,  measures,  and  actions  for  integrated \nmultimodal passenger transport hubs development are implemented. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will have three main outputs intended to support the development of multimodal \nhubs  in  the  PRC:  (i)  illustrated  multimodal  hub  development  guide,  (ii)  recommendations \n(including  indicators)  for  performance  assessment  of  multimodal  hubs,  and  (iii)  policy \nrecommendations for improving interagency coordination. \n \n13.  Illustrated multimodal hub development guide. The TA will focus on bringing together \nexamples of best practice multimodal hubs from around the PRC and internationally, identify \nkey features and determine their impact on system performance, and publish detailed guidelines \non best practices for different types of hubs.  \n \n14.  The  illustrated  guide  will  be  published  as  a  knowledge  product  for  designing  and \ndeveloping multimodal passenger transport hubs. It will be created in a web format version, \nwhich will be uploaded for ready reference. The book will (i) discuss key principles of multimodal \nhub design; (ii) explain potential design features, particularly in the context of passenger and \nvehicular flow diagrams; (iii) discuss and illustrate examples of integrated land use planning for \nsuch  hubs  based  on  successful  experiences  in  other  countries;  (iv)  provide  pictures, \nphotographs,  design  concepts,  and  three-dimensional  views  to  explain  best  practice;  and  \n(v) include illustrated examples based on reviews of existing designs of hubs that have been \ncompleted or are under construction. \n \n15.  Recommendations  (including  indicators)  for  performance  assessment  of \nmultimodal  hubs. A key aspect of the study will be to conduct research on the financial \nmeasures, appraisal methodology, and performance specifications that can be used to assess \nthe  proposed  multimodal  hub  projects.  Examples  include  (i)  design  standards  reflected  in \nperformance  measures  of  multimodal  transfers  such  as  maximum  distances  or  maximum \ntransfer times between modes; (ii) financial standards based on minimum\u2013maximum ratios such \n ", "4   \nas investment\u2013time saved; (iii) service standards based on information system specifications, \nticketing systems, and standards for signage and other services; and (iv) model for realizing \nland value gains and commercial spinoffs to enhance overall financial viability. The findings and \nrecommendations will be published as a policy-oriented knowledge product. \n \n16.  The standards may be different depending on passenger demand projected for the hub, \nthe number of modes to be integrated, and the size and type of facility. The TA will conduct \nresearch on key financial and performance measures and establish benchmarks based on best \npractice multimodal hubs from around the world for multimodal accessibility, efficiency, and \nfinancial sustainability. \n \n17.   Policy  recommendations  for  improving  interagency  coordination.  The  TA  will \nprepare  a  detailed  scheme  to  provide  incentives  for  cooperation  among  all  modes  and \nstakeholders.  The  TA  outputs  will  include  stakeholder  workshops  to  disseminate  the  best \npractices in multimodal hub design, promote consensus in strategies for improving interagency \ncoordination, and formulate a proposed implementation strategy that identifies new projects that \ncould apply the recommendations. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The government has requested ADB to finance $500,000 equivalent. The TA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources).  \nThe  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  suitably  furnished  office \naccommodation with utilities; telecommunications access; materials, maps, data and documents \nrequired  by  the  TA;  counterpart  professional  staff,  and  support  staff;  and  other  in-kind \ncontributions. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The Ministry of Transport (MOT) will be the executing agency for the TA. It will be \nresponsible  for  guiding  and  supervising  the  TA  activities  and  coordinating  with  relevant \ngovernment agencies and organizations, including provincial and local governments. MOT is \nsupporting the implementation of pilot and demonstration multimodal hub projects in a number \nof  provinces.  Currently,  plans  are  in  place  to  build  more  than  100  passenger-transport \nmultimodal hubs in the PRC. MOT needs effective models of support, and technical guidelines \nand  standards  to  guide  the  implementation  of  multimodal  passenger  hubs  in  urban  areas \nnationwide. The support for multimodal hubs represents an opportunity to develop a new area \nfor ADB-financed investment in urban transport in the PRC in line with the direction of ADB\u2019s \nSustainable Transport Initiative. \n \n20.  The TA will require about 18 person-months of national and about 7 person-months of \ninternational consulting services to carry out the terms of reference (Appendix 3). ADB will \nengage a team of national consultants through a consulting firm, in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time) on the basis of the \nquality of the proposal (90%) and the cost of services to be provided (10%), using simplified \ntechnical proposal procedures. The 90:10 weighting is appropriate because (i) the TA is an \nadvanced assignment that requires a high degree of expertise in multimodal hub designs, and  \n(ii) the TA is likely to have a significant impact on future development of multimodal hubs in the \nPRC. \n \n ", "  5\n21.  ADB will engage individual international consultants in accordance with the Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants. Individual consultants are needed, as the TA is an advanced \nassignment that requires specialized expertise in integrated urban transport hub designs and \ninstitutional coordination. These are new themes, even within developed countries, and the \nrequired skill sets are unlikely to be readily available through firms. The individuals may be from \nacademia in order to have a suitable background to develop the best practice guide that collates \nvaried experiences in multiple countries. \n \n22.  Disbursement will be undertaken in line with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA will be implemented from 15 February \n2012 to 15 March 2013. \n \n23.  The consultants will submit inception, interim, draft final, and other reports as applicable. \nThey will hold regular workshops to present findings and recommendations and solicit feedback \nfrom key stakeholders. The Ministry of Railways and other relevant ministries and agencies will \nbe closely consulted and involved during TA implementation and in the review of the TA outputs. \nThey will be invited to participate in the review workshops and discussions pertaining to the TA. \nADB missions will monitor TA progress and performance. The consultants are expected to \nprepare  and  disseminate  working  papers  describing  key  findings,  recommendations,  and \nlessons from TA implementation. \n \nIV.
