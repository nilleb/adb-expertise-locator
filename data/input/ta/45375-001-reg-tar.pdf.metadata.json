INTRODUCTION \n1.  A key requirement for the achievement of inclusive growth is the generation of decent \nemployment opportunities for broad segments of the population. Decent jobs provide productive \nand satisfying work situations, livable wages, social security and protection, and a measure of \njob stability. These elements allow women and men to share in the fruits of national economic \ngrowth and to provide for the health, nutrition, and education of their children. Ensuring access \nto  employment  opportunities  is  a  key  element  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s) \ninclusive growth framework and supports Strategy 2020.1 \n \n2.  Providing  the  right  environment  for  decent  employment  is  a  chief  challenge  and \npreoccupation of governments in the region. Policies at a number of levels will impact on \nemployment  outcomes.  Macroeconomic  policy  sets  the  broad  framework  for  investment, \nproduction, and thus job creation. At the same time, labor market policies can facilitate hiring by \nreducing search costs or inhibit hiring by increasing the costs of engaging workers. Finally, \nquality education and skills training is critical to ensuring that individuals gain skills that meet the \nneeds of employers.    \n \n3.  The  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  study  the  functioning  of  labor  markets,  including \nmarket failures and government attempts to overcome those failures, in Cambodia, Viet Nam, \nand two other developing member countries (DMCs).2 The details of the TA, including the \nimpact, outcome, outputs, implementation, cost, and other aspects will be presented to each \ncountry\u2019s government and clearance will be secured before TA implementation is initiated.3 The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES     \n4.  The demand-side issues of generating decent employment opportunities are rooted in \nthe larger evolution of the economy, notably its structural transformation, the level of investment, \nand the employment intensity of that investment. A country\u2019s specific product mix and use of \ntechnology (capital intensity) will further shape the nature of job creation. While investment is \nfundamental to job creation, it is only one of the factors that determine employment outcomes. \nThe nature of labor market policies, laws, regulations, and institutions (PLRIs) and the education \nand skills mix of the population are also significant factors.  \n \n5.  PLRIs that govern the labor market may inhibit the hiring of prospective workers into \ndecent jobs in the formal sector. A fundamental asymmetry exists between jobseekers who are \nlooking for the right job, and employers who are seeking to fill vacancies with candidates that \npossess the right mix of skills, attitudes, and competencies. The public employment service is \ndesigned to overcome this asymmetry by providing a matching function but often provides that \nfunction inadequately. In many countries, the job matching role is shifting to electronic portals, \nbut they tend only to service more wealthy segments that are computer literate and have access \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n2  The DMCs will be selected based on country diagnostics studies for 2013.  \n3  The Southeast Asia Department (SERD) has endorsed the inclusion of Cambodia and Viet Nam under the TA. The \nRegional and Sustainable Development Department (RSDD) has two recently approved TA projects on related \nissues, one that includes Viet Nam and the other that includes Cambodia (footnote 12).  The objective of building \nsynergies between the three TA projects (the two in RSDD and this one) is noted in para. 12.  The country \nselection criteria for the current TA is provided in para. 14.  \n ", "2  \nto hardware and the internet.4 A national qualifications framework can also assist by providing \nan agreed set of standards against which employers can make hiring decisions.5   \n \n6.  Aside from the asymmetry problem, other labor market PLRIs can inhibit hiring. These \nregulations  can  make  it  costly  to  hire  workers  formally  (owing  to  wage  and  non-wage \nrequirements), in particular because they make it difficult for employers to alter their workforce \nas required by changing business conditions. Chief among these barriers are restrictions on \nretrenching workers, limits on the ability to alter the scope or hours of a worker\u2019s work, the cost \nof  retrenchment  in  terms  of  severance  and  related  payments,  and  other  regulations  on \nentitlements. For example, in Viet Nam an employer must pay 43 weeks of salary to a laid-off \nworker who has been employed for 10 years or more. If the worker has been employed for \n20 years or more, the payout is 83 weeks (about 1.5 years of salary). In Cambodia, employer \nobligations are less onerous\u201421 weeks of pay for 10 years of service and 26 weeks of pay for \n20 years of service.6 Some countries are moving to a more balanced system of \u201cflexicurity\u201d that \ncombines flexibility for employers with state-supported security (social protection) for workers. \nSuch newer systems rely less on older systems of rigid retrenchment provisions and onerous \nemployer-based severance obligations.7     \n \n7.  To achieve positive employment outcomes, a system of general as well as technical \nvocational  education  and  training  is  needed  that  is  highly  developed  at  three  key  stages. \nStage 1 is access to education and skills training opportunities; stage 2 is the provision of high \nquality and market-relevant education and skills to students, trainees, and workers; and stage 3 \nis the transition of educated and skilled people into employment (or in the case of in-service \nupgrading, their continued employment). Stages 2 and 3 are highly interrelated; without relevant \nskills, it is difficult to place trainees and graduates in decent work situations. Women, youth, \nethnic minorities, lower caste members, remote residents, people living with disabilities, and the \npoor and lower-middle class face particular challenges in accessing decent education and \ntraining and, by extension, employment opportunities. \n \n8.  To ensure that jobseekers have the attributes demanded by employers, a sound labor \nmarket information system is needed. Such a system allows information about the needs of \nemployers to be communicated back to young people embarking on education and to education \ninstitutes. Viet Nam, with assistance from the International Labour Organization (ILO), has \nrecently set up a labor market information system. Education and training curricula need to \nsynchronize with the needs of the job market for the effective matching of the supply of skilled \nworkers  with  the  demand  by  enterprises.8 Without  such  synchronization,  people  will  have \ndifficulty finding work and economies will have difficulty producing quality goods and services \nefficiently. This is important for all countries and may be especially critical for those seeking to \navoid the middle-income trap. Furthermore, not only might graduates and existing workers \npossess the wrong skills, but a large portion of the labor force, including new entrants, may be \nunskilled.     \n                                                 \n4  A review of six Asian countries found that the employment service included an internet portal format in some cases, \nwith Sri Lanka adopting a public\u2013private partnership arrangement to do so.

An \u201cinadequately educated \nworkforce\u201d is listed as the 4th most important business constraint in Viet Nam and the 8th most \nimportant in Cambodia. Furthermore, the percentage of production workers in enterprises that \nare considered \u201cunskilled\u201d remains relatively high in many Asian countries\u201426% in Cambodia \nand 21% in Viet Nam.9  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be the use of improved labor market analysis for better economic policy \nand sector planning decisions by four DMCs and ADB. The outcome will be improved analysis \nand  understanding  of  labor  markets  that  feed  into  ADB\u2019s  country  diagnostic  studies,  the \ngovernment\u2019s medium-term planning, and ADB\u2019s operations. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.   The TA will assess the nature of the labor market and labor market policies in four DMCs. \nThe methodology will be based on, but also expand and develop, the approach used in ADB\u2019s \ncountry  diagnostic  studies  (CDSs).  The  CDS  approach  combines  the  well-known  growth \ndiagnostics framework developed by Hausmann, Rodrik, and Velasco10 with the diagnostic \nframework for inclusiveness that has been added by ADB to ensure sufficient focus on poverty, \ninequality, employment, and other aspects of socioeconomic inclusion.11 The TA will develop \nthe labor market aspects of the CDS approach and then apply it in the four DMCs.   \n \n12.  Considerable analysis of the labor market and the education and training sector has \nbeen undertaken by various organizations in the two countries specified under this TA. ADB and \nother agencies, such as the ILO, have recently completed or have ongoing projects in the areas \nof education, including technical vocational education and training, and labor market information. \nFurthermore, two recently approved TA projects in the Regional and Sustainable Development \nDepartment focus on various aspects of green jobs, gender, skills, and labor markets.12 The TA \nwill build on and complement the research, analysis, and activities that have been undertaken to \ndate, and generate synergies with the two recently approved TA projects.   \n \n13.  A  specific  focus  of  the  TA  will  be  on  the  flow  of  information  between  and  among \nemployers, jobseekers, youth entering post-basic education, labor market policy planners in \ngovernment,  and  the  education  system,  including  education  and  training  institutes.  The \ninformation flows will be mapped and key stakeholders surveyed to determine bottlenecks that \ninhibit private and public planning for employment and skills. In conducting the analysis, the \nresearch will take into account structural change, patterns of investment that shape employment \ndemand, the flow of individuals between rural and urban areas, and the nature of formal versus \n                                                 \n9  World Bank.

As appropriate, the analysis may draw on data from existing household \nand labor market surveys conducted by national statistics offices or other agencies, where such \ndata is relevant and timely. In conducting the analysis and data gathering, distinctions will be \nmade based on gender and socioeconomic status (poor and non-poor, etc.) and other relevant \ncriteria where possible and as appropriate to the analysis.    \n \n14.    The TA will have two main components: (i) in-depth country assessments, as outlined \nabove;  and  (ii)  broad  dissemination  of  the  key  findings  and  recommendations,  principally \nthrough discussion at a national forum with policy makers and other stakeholders. The criteria \nfor country selection under the TA include: the labor market being at a critical stage in the \nprocess  of  industrialization  and  economic  transformation;  the  opportunity  to  inform  the \ngovernments\u2019  medium-term  development  planning  in  these  areas;  and,  the  opportunity  to \nprovide inputs to the country partnership strategy and country diagnostic study.13  Such phased \napproach will allow insights from the two initial studies under this TA to improve the detailed \ndesign and scope of the other two studies that will be carried out under this TA in 2013, \nensuring that learning takes place over the course of the TA. \n \n15.    Expanding access to good employment opportunities is fundamental to ensuring that the \nbenefits of growth in Asia are widely distributed among the population, including women, youth, \nthe poor and lower-middle class, and other disadvantaged groups. The TA strongly supports \ninclusive growth, which is one of the three pillars of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020. Inclusive growth is a \nkey component of the Economics and Research Department Priorities for 2010\u20132012,14 and its \nStrategic Initiatives for 2012\u20132014 (draft), which emphasizes the importance of \u201coperations \nsupport through rigorous research,\u201d which this TA will seek to achieve through its targeting of \nthe country partnership strategy process. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $800,000 equivalent and will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund ($400,000 from TASF-IV and $400,000 from TASF-\nother sources). The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 29 months from December 2011 to April 2014.15 ADB \nwill be the executing agency and the Economic Analysis and Operations Support Division of \nERD will lead TA implementation and administration. ADB will provide funding and staff time for \nthe implementation, management, and successful completion of the TA. While management will \nbe based in ERD, which is a knowledge department, collaboration with regional department(s) \nand resident mission(s) will ensure that cross-fertilization between departments and that the \nresults of the TA will benefit ADB\u2019s operations. In addition, collaboration is envisioned with the \nRegional and Sustainable Development Department (RSDD), given the two related TA projects \n                                                 \n13 In addition to supporting government development planning, the outputs for Cambodia will assist in the formulation \nof the next country partnership strategy whereas for Viet Nam they will support the joint multi-donor contribution to \nthe formulation of the government\u2019s next Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy.  These two \ncountries were also chosen so that the outputs can provide inputs to country diagnostic studies which are \nscheduled for preparation for these countries by the ADB in 2012 in close consultation with the respective \ngovernments. The same criteria mix (critical development issues, government planning, CPS and CDS) will be \nused in the selection of the two additional countries for study in 2013. \n14 ADB. 2010.
