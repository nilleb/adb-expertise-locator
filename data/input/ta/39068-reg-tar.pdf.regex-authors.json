The recent outbreaks of severe emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), particularly severe \nacute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and more recently H5N1 avian influenza, have focused \nattention on the weakness of epidemiological surveillance and response (ESR) systems in \ndeveloping  countries  and  the  heightened  vulnerability  of  people  living  in  Asia.  The  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  plays  a  crucial  role  in  responding  to  regional  needs,  in  close \ncoordination with its development partners, by using its financial and technical resources to help \naddress immediate needs and strengthen preparedness. Communicable disease prevention is a \nregional  public  good  and  forms  one  pillar  of  the  draft  Regional  Cooperation  Strategy  and \nProgram (RCSP) for Southeast Asia. In the context of the potential impact of EIDs in Indonesia, \nMalaysia,  and  Philippines,  the  proposed  regional  technical  assistance  (TA)  is  intended  to \nsupport interventions to reduce vulnerability through improvements to ESR systems in each \ncountry and to evaluate the benefits of possible collective measures in the three countries. \nAlthough the Project will cover only the three countries, it will support activities, dialogue, and \npilot  initiatives  that  will  contribute  to  broader  interaction  with  regional  bodies  such  as  the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and ASEAN+3.1   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Avian influenza caused by the influenza A type H5N1 virus is now endemic among birds \nin several Asian countries, including Indonesia, and the number of human infections is growing.  \nThe World Health Organization (WHO) warns that the avian influenza virus could evolve into a \nhuman influenza virus leading to a global pandemic. The SARS virus could make a return to \nAsia in the northern hemisphere winter of 2005. All three countries are vulnerable to outbreaks \nof avian influenza and SARS and any one of them could form the epicenter of a pandemic. \n \n3.  HIV/AIDS is spreading in the three countries. Indonesia has reached a concentrated \nepidemic  stage2 in  certain  geographic  areas,  while  in  Malaysia  there  are  concentrated \nepidemics among intravenous drug users and commercial sex workers.  High-risk groups, \nwomen,  and  adolescents  remain  highly  vulnerable  in  all  three  countries.  Most  HIV/AIDS \nprevention and control activities are undertaken at national and community levels, but there is a \nneed for selected regional initiatives as well. More inter-country trade and mobility of people \nmake preventing and controlling HIV/AIDS more difficult. Commercial sex workers, trafficked \nwomen and children, construction workers, seafarers, truck drivers, and other mobile groups \nmove across different parts of the three countries. Members of these groups are often beyond \nthe reach of health service providers for detection and treatment. The Philippines, despite its \nrelatively low HIV/AIDS prevalence, is vulnerable in the medium term. With increasing mobility \nof the population, regional cooperation is necessary to halt these potential transmission sources. \n \n4.  Because  of  their  potential  for  pandemic,  EIDs  are  receiving  increased  international \nattention  and  substantial  international  support  has  been  mobilized  to  address  HIV/AIDS. \nHowever, measles, poliomyelitis, tuberculosis, malaria, infectious diarrhea, typhoid, cholera, \nwater- and food-borne diseases, dengue, and parasitic diseases also cause significant morbidity \nand  mortality.  The  incidence  of  hepatitis  C  and  dengue hemorrhagic  fever  is  approaching \nepidemic proportions in the three countries, while poliomyelitis recently re-emerged in Indonesia. \nThese neglected endemic diseases are often concentrated in impoverished populations living in \nmarginalized areas or urban slums. They disproportionately affect children and affect school \n                                                 \n1  Includes the People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and Republic of Korea. \n2  Above 5% prevalence among any high-risk group. \n ", "2     \nattendance,  cognitive  development,  physical  growth,  and  productivity.  Included  in  these \nneglected  endemic  diseases  are  worm  infestations  such  as  helminthiasis,  filariasis,  and \nschistosomiasis, the control of which would result in major health and education benefits to \nchildren. Cost-effective interventions are available to manage most common infections, but \nbudget shortfalls and structural problems have not allowed them to be used to their maximum \npotential.  \n \n5.  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  and  Philippines  are  all  committed  to  achieving  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) by 2015. Four out of the eight MDGs relate directly to health and \nnutrition: reducing child and maternal mortality and malnutrition, and containing and beginning \nto reverse the trend of HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases. If communicable diseases \nare  not  controlled,  progress  towards  reducing  child  and  maternal  mortality  is  unlikely.  \nCommunicable diseases also have a profound effect on learning and productivity. Thus, if the \nMDGs are to be achieved, a major reduction in the high levels of communicable diseases in the \nthree  countries  is  required.  An  effective  ESR  system  must  produce  accurate  and  timely \nreporting, verification, assessment, and response, including strategic forecasting and preventive \nmeasures. Each country has had various degrees of success, often isolated to specific disease \nprograms. However, the ESR systems need strengthening in both technical capability and in \ncoverage to achieve any major impact on the levels of communicable diseases. \n \n6.  Avian  influenza  is  already  endemic  in  poultry  in  Indonesia.  Malaysia  successfully \ncontained and eradicated an avian influenza outbreak in poultry in 2004, but, like the Philippines, \nremains at risk from migratory birds and outbreaks in neighboring countries. Current ESR \nsystems in the three countries, including hospital preparedness, are not sufficient to cope with a \nmajor  EID  outbreak.  High-risk  groups  in  all  three  countries  are  increasingly  vulnerable  to \nHIV/AIDS because of social changes and greater mobility. ESR systems are already under \nstrain because of population growth, changing demographics,3 increased commerce, and more \nsocial  interaction.  Their  weaknesses  have  been  demonstrated  by  (i)  the  reemergence  of \npoliomyelitis in Indonesia, despite its reported eradication; (ii) a measles outbreak that reached \nepidemic levels in the Philippines; and (iii) the fact that filariasis is endemic in Indonesia and \nPhilippines, despite being easily preventable. Although there have been significant government \nefforts and support from development partners, health surveillance and preventive care cannot \naddress the existing burden of disease, let alone new more complex EIDs.    \n \n7.  So far, outbreaks of SARS and avian influenza have had little impact on population \nhealth in the three countries,4 but they have the potential to cause catastrophic damage. The \noutbreaks have already had major economic consequences amounting to millions of dollars in \ndirect losses and billions in indirect losses through declining tourism, reduced flows of foreign \ninvestment, and export restrictions on livestock and animal products. HIV/AIDS, SARS, and \navian influenza have reinforced the need for regional cooperation for communicable disease \ncontrol and Indonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines are already working together closely and \nthrough regional organizations. Rapid identification of disease outbreaks and a coordinated \nregional response will help to limit the impacts of outbreaks by containing them, monitoring the \nspread  and  genotype  of  the  virus,  identifying  potential  hosts,  preparing  for  subsequent \noutbreaks  with  vaccinations  or  other  preventive  measures,  and  treating  cases.  Early  and \naccurate detection is vital to prevent the spread of other re-emerging diseases such as measles, \n                                                 \n3   For example, rapid urbanization and urban sprawl. Recent outbreaks of dengue and malaria have occurred mainly \nin  densely-packed urban slums. \n4  The case fatality rate for SARS is around 10% and human avian influenza, despite its high fatality rate of about \n50%, is not easily transmitted from human to human.  \n ", "  3\nJapanese  encephalitis,  poliomyelitis,  dengue,  typhoid,  and  cholera.  To  enhance  national \neconomic and health security, epidemics must be contained at their source.  \n \n8.  Programs for prevention and control of communicable disease are regional public goods: \nthere are greater benefits to be obtained through regional cooperation than would be possible \nthrough the independent actions of each country. First, communicable diseases are transmitted \nby  people,  pests,  parasites,  livestock,  food,  and  other  common  vectors  and  environments \nthroughout a particular geographic region, regardless of national borders. Avian influenza has \ndemonstrated how a virus may be transmitted across borders by air through migratory birds, to \nswine and humans following contact with infected birds, and by consumption of infected raw \npoultry products. Second, regional cooperation will enable participating countries to exchange \nbest practices on health policies, system design, specific disease interventions, and other key \nlessons. This will facilitate greater frequency, consistency, and clarity in information exchange. It \nwill also engender trust and transparency surveillance, response, and reporting, an essential \ncomponent of communicable disease control in the three countries.  \n \n9.  Coordination with other stakeholders will be essential to optimize the impact of the TA. \nThe World Health Organization (WHO) is the lead development partner in the health sector, \nparticularly for ESR. ADB will partner with the WHO regional and country offices in the three \ncountries to help implement the TA by providing specialist advice and technical inputs.  A wide \nrange of development partners and donors support communicable disease control programs in \nall three countries.5 Most externally financed programs have tended to be disease-specific. This \nis often quite a successful and valid approach, given that diseases often have different causes \nand treatments. However, countries cannot afford to set up new ESR systems in response to \neach outbreak or health emergency. An ESR system is not a unified set of procedures, but \nrather an aggregate of heterogeneous but similar subsystems. It is important to optimize the \nsynergies in these subsystems. The TA is intended to provide an assessment of the ESR \nsystem as a whole for each country. From this, potential subregional operations will be derived \nthat  would  help  mitigate  disease  vulnerabilities  and  add  value  to  national  systems.  \nAssessments, tests, pilots, and protocols will further be developed for the three countries. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The goal of the proposed TA is to help support the three countries to reduce mortality \nand morbidity due to communicable diseases6 and to achieve the related MDGs. The impact of \nthe  Project  will  include  an  improved  and  integrated  national  disease  surveillance  and \npreparedness system in each of the three countries; a comprehensive system for investigation, \ncase  management,  and  mitigation  at  local,  national  and  subregional  levels;  an  improved \ninformation and communication mechanism; and supportive national policies for communicable \ndisease control. The TA\u2019s purposes are to (i) strengthen disease surveillance systems for early \ndiseases detection and response, (ii) help develop national capacity to respond to an outbreak, \nand  (iii)  harmonize  national  efforts  to  promote  a  subregional  collaboration  mechanism  for \ncommunicable disease control and the monitoring, containment, and prevention of outbreaks. \nADB will work closely with the three governments, WHO, and other stakeholders, in particular \nother  development  partners  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  to  identify  where \n                                                 \n5  Includes other United Nations agencies, multilateral banks, bilateral aid agencies, as well as international and local \nNGOs, charitable organizations, and corporate foundations. \n6  The TA is targeted on ESR for communicable and infectious diseases, not on all health surveillance systems (for \nexample, chronic, lifestyle, and hereditary diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and cancers.) \n ", "4     \nresources are deployed, where there are gaps in coverage, and to take action to mobilize \nappropriate resources.  \n \nB.  Methodology, Approach, and Key Activities \n \n11.  The  TA  is  divided  into  three  main  components.  The  first  two  will  be  conducted  in \nsequence and will provide the overall structure for activities under component C. \n  \n(i)  Component A: Country and Subregional Epidemiological Profiles. National \nepidemiological profiles for Indonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines will be drawn up \nusing  a  standard  data  and  mapping  template  that  can  accommodate  data \ngenerated by the existing health information systems of each country and that \ndescribes  each  major  disease,  including  EIDs.  These  findings  will  be \nconsolidated  to  create  a  web-enabled  subregional  epidemiological  profile, \nincluding potential cross-border transmission vectors and vulnerable areas.  \n \n(ii)  Component B: Outbreak Simulation and Testing to Assess ESR Systems. \nDrawing on information and assessments generated by component A, the ESR \nsystem in each country and selected subsystems will be tested through real time \nsimulated field exercises or analysis of process documentation and data from \ncurrent  cases.7   An  integral  part  of  the  exercise  will  be  an  inter-country \nsecondment  program.  Subregional  collaboration,  networking  and  information \nsharing will be promoted through joint research and workshops.  \n \n(iii)  Component  C:  Innovative  Measures  to  Enhance  ESR  Systems.  This \ncomponent  will  consist  of  specific  activities  to  address  weaknesses  in  the \nsurveillance  system  (or  subsystem)  or  elsewhere  in  the  health  system  that \nemerge from activities under components A and B. These will be relatively small-\nscale interventions, such as research and case studies, local pilot operations, \ntraining to strengthen reporting from decentralized units, or NGO-led community \nHIV/AIDS initiatives, among others. Support could also be provided to prepare \npreliminary designs for longer-term or large-scale projects beyond the financing \nenvelope or time horizon of the TA.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.7 million equivalent. ADB will finance $1.2 \nmillion on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The balance of $0.5 million equivalent \nwill be provided in-kind by the participating countries.8 The cost estimates and financing plan are \nin Appendix 2. ADB and its partners will also actively seek additional external grant cofinancing.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  ADB (Southeast Asia Department [SERD]) will be the executing agency for the TA. \nSERD will work in close cooperation with the Regional Sustainable Development Department to \nensure  the  TA  complements  other  ongoing  ADB-wide  activities,  particularly  operations  to \n                                                 \n7  The testing method will vary depending upon the structure of the surveillance subsystem and typology of the \ndisease, e.g., serological testing for poliomyelitis vaccination as opposed to \u2018outbreak\u2019 scenarios for dengue or \navian influenza.  \n8  In the form of office space, local travel, remuneration of counterpart and supporting staff, office facilities and utilities, \nand in-country workshop support as well as in the conduct of monitoring and evaluation activities. \n ", "  5\naddress avian influenza in the region. A memorandum of understanding will be entered into \nbetween ADB and WHO outlining a cooperation framework for TA implementation. Local WHO \noffices will collaborate and provide technical support at the national level, while activities will be \ncoordinated through the two WHO regional offices.9 Each participating country will designate an \ninstitutional focal point, and a project coordinator to interact with other government agencies, \nand with the consultants engaged under the TA. Counterpart personnel will provide direction \nand technical inputs and will participate in the facilitation and conduct of field simulations and \nevaluation.  ADB  will  provide  international  travel,  accommodation,  and  per  diem  for  staff \nseconded  under  the  exchange  program  and  for  official  participants,  including  experts,  at \nsubregional workshops and the international conference.  \n \n14.  A  project  management  consulting  firm  will  be  engaged  by  ADB.  Approximately  12 \nperson-months of international and 60 person-months of domestic consultant services will be \nrequired in (i) project management and implementation, (ii) ESR system, (iii) health systems \nmanagement, and (iv) systems integration and geographic information system database and \nwebsite development. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. The firm will procure \nthrough competitive bidding the services of an information technology (IT) firm to develop a \nportal for the subregional epidemiological profile. In addition to the provision of consultants, the \nfirm will undertake arrangements for training, testing and simulation exercises, and a conference. \nWith ADB approval, the firm will procure or subcontract services, equipment, and activities \nproposed under component C that are within cost ceiling parameters. The consulting firm will be \nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants  using  the \nsimplified technical proposal procedure.  \n \n15.  Outcomes from components A and B will help identify concrete activities for component \nC. Proposals are expected to be developed by the implementing agencies with the assistance of \nthe consultant team and WHO. Activities under component C costing less than $100,000 will be \ncontracted or procured through the consulting firm. Activities estimated to exceed this ceiling will \nbe  procured  by  ADB.  Implementation  arrangements,  particularly  for  component  C,  will  be \nflexible  and  will  allow  adjustment  in  the  terms  of  reference  of  consultants,  duration,  and \nschedule  of  expert  inputs.  Procurement  of  other  consulting  services,  if  required  under \ncomponent C, will follow ADB\u2019s procedures with reasonable flexibility. Procurement of most \nsmall equipment, facilities, services, and supplies will be outsourced through the consultants \nusing international shopping, direct purchase, or other arrangements acceptable to ADB.  \n \n16.  The project will begin in March 2006 and be implemented over 18 months (August 2007). \nWithin 2 months from start-up, an inception report will be submitted outlining the detailed \nactivities  and  implementation  schedule  for  components  A  and  B  of  the  Project.  National \nepidemiological profiles are expected to be completed by June 2006 and the web-enabled \nsubregional epidemiological profile operational by August 2006. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n17.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $1,200,000 on a grant basis for Strengthening Epidemiological \nSurveillance and Response for Communicable Diseases in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines.  \n                                                 \n9 Within the WHO organization, Philippines and Malaysia are under the Western Pacific Regional Office and \nIndonesia is under the Southeast Asia Regional Office. \n ", "6    Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets/Indicators  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nMechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nReduced burden of  All countries  \u2022  Annual health statistics  \u2022  No major social or \nendemic communicable  \u2022  Decrease burden of  reports  economic disruptions to \ndiseases, and reduced  communicable diseases         \u2022  Statistical surveys and  allow time to set up and \nrisk of emerging diseases  [1-2 disease(s) to be selected  qualitative surveys  test the system  \nin Indonesia, Malaysia,  as indicator after incidence  \u2022  National demographic  \u2022  Disease control \nand Philippines leading to  baseline established in  and health surveys  interventions are \nattainment of the  components A and B]   \u2022  Communicable  effective  \ncountries\u2019 health-related    diseases surveillance   \nMDGs     systems  Risk \n  \u2022  MDG update reports  \u2022  Sudden emergence of \n  \u2022  UNAIDS surveys  avian influenza as a \n  pandemic overwhelms \nhealth systems \nOutcomes      Assumptions \n      \u2022  Surveillance system is \nTimely and adequate  \u2022  Proportion of targeted districts  \u2022  ESR systems,  capable of identifying \nidentification and  that provided timely reporting  including WHO  diseases in a timely \ncontainment of epidemics  and appropriate response to  monitoring reports,  manner. \n  disease outbreaks  disease outbreak  \u2022  Funding for surveillance \n    reports, and informal  and response system is \nImproved capacity for  \u2022  Spread of communicable  sources  adequate. \ncommunicable disease  diseases, slowed or controlled    \u2022  Necessary work can be \ncontrol  by reduction in delay between  carried out in border and \n  incidence-reporting-response  isolated areas \n  times   \nRisk \n\u2022  Lack of commitment and \ncapacity of government \nagencies prevents \neffective use of \nresources \n \nImproved prevention and  \u2022  Proportion of targeted groups,  \u2022  Community health  Assumptions \ncare of communicable  particularly in border areas,  surveys  \u2022  Current funding for \ndiseases  in vulnerable  that  received proper  \u2022  Hospital and clinic  communicable disease \npopulations, particularly  prevention and care  records  control and health \nalong borders    services is sustained \n  \u2022  Staff are available to \n  expand services \n   \n  Risk \n  \u2022  Resistance of local \n  authorities prevents \n  effective capacity \n  development \nImproved expertise, policy  \u2022  Policy reforms carried out to  \u2022  Reports on cross- Assumptions \ninitiatives, and  improve communicable  border ESR functioning  \u2022  Policies are appropriate \ncoordination of countries  disease control, including  and cross-border  and effectively \nto improve ESR  improved ESR, cross-border  vectors  implemented. \nand bilateral coordination, and  \u2022  Reports on health  \u2022  Access of migrants and \nother health system  services for migrants  mobile people is \nimprovements  and mobile people   measured \n\u2022  Access of migrants and mobile   \npeople to health services   Risk \n  \u2022  Resistance by local \nauthorities to effective \ntrans-border \ncooperation reduces \nimpact \n ", "                      Appendix 1  7\n                         \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets/Indicators  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nMechanisms   and Risks  \nOutputs  \u2022  Preparedness plans formulated  \u2022  Project reports  Assumptions \n1.
