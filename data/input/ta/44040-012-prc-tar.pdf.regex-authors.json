INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  technical \nassistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to conduct a study on nonpoint \nsource  (NPS)  pollution  monitoring  and  measurement,  and  to  develop  an  NPS  pollution \nmanagement framework.1 The TA is in the PRC\u2019s country operations business plan, 2011\u20132013 \nand was in the standby category in ADB\u2019s TA pipeline for 2011, but was upgraded to firm \ncategory based on government\u2019s request. ADB fielded a reconnaissance mission to Beijing in \nApril 2011 and held discussions with the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) to clarify \nand agree on the scope, impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, and \nfinancing arrangements for the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The \nTA provides timely support to the PRC\u2019s transition towards more sustainable development and a \nharmonious society. It is also in line with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020,2 which aims to promote inclusive \ngrowth and environmentally sustainable growth.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Water resource scarcity is a serious constraint on the PRC\u2019s sustainable development. \nThe country\u2019s annual per capita water availability of 1,800\u20132,200 cubic meters is about one-\nquarter of the world average; the northern part of the PRC is below the water scarcity threshold \nof 1,000 cubic meters per capita. Severe water pollution exacerbates water scarcity in the PRC. \nA report by MEP on the state of the environment in 2009 found that more than 40% of the 408 \nsections along the major PRC rivers where water quality is monitored had unsafe water for \nhuman consumption and about 18% had unsafe water for any use. Water quality has not \nimproved significantly with rapid economic growth.4 \n \n3.  Sources of water pollution can be divided into two broad categories: point sources and \nnonpoint sources. Point sources of water pollution, such as large industrial facilities or sewage \ntreatment plants, emit pollutants into a water body from a fixed, readily identifiable point. In \ncontrast, emissions from nonpoint sources are geographically diffused and temporally stochastic. \nMajor nonpoint sources of water pollution include agrochemical (fertilizer, pesticide, herbicide) \nrunoff, discharges from animal or aquatic production activities, and soil erosion. These are \nmostly concentrated in rural areas. \n \n4.    While the government has made advances in controlling industrial and domestic point \nsources of water pollution, NPS pollution has become a growing challenge nationwide. The first \nnational survey of pollution sources carried out by the MEP between 2007 and 2010 concluded \nthat NPS pollution accounted for about 44% of chemical oxygen demand, 55% of nitrogen, and \n67% of phosphorous discharges.5 Runoff from farms was the second-largest source of nitrogen \ndischarges after domestic wastewater. Intensive animal husbandry was found to be the largest \nsource  of  phosphorous  discharges.  Both  nitrogen  and  phosphorous discharges  contributed \ndirectly to the pervasive eutrophication of the water in the PRC. Therefore, NPS pollution will \nhave to be dealt with effectively to bring water pollution under control. \n \n                                                \n1 The original title was Nonpoint Source Pollution Prevention and Rural Environment Protection. \n2 ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila.  \n3 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 14 November 2011. \n4 Government of the PRC, MEP. 2010. Annual Environmental Report. Beijing. \n5 Government of the PRC, MEP. 2010. Census of the Pollution Sources in the PRC. Beijing. \n ", "2   \n5.   The  nature  of  nonpoint  sources  determines  the  difficulties  and  challenges  in  NPS \npollution control. First, it is extremely difficult to monitor and measure emissions from nonpoint \nsources, although monitoring and measuring NPS discharges are the bases for pollution control \ninstruments such as the emissions trading program. In developed countries, emission proxies \nthrough  measuring  inputs  (e.g.,  fertilizer  use),  agricultural  practices,  and  land  use  and \nperformance  (e.g.,  annual  soil  loss)  were  often  developed  and  used  to  estimate  pollutant \ndischarges through sophisticated models. To obtain accurate estimates of NPS emissions, \nthese monitoring and measurement methods, and the associated models, must be localized. \nThis requires a tremendous amount of inputs from research and field work, as well as an \nenormous amount of data. Data availability, and implementation costs and capacity, have to be \ntaken into account in developing countries. Therefore, developing countries such as the PRC \nmust  develop  feasible  and  cost-effective  methods  to  monitor  and  measure  NPS  pollution \nemissions.  \n \n6.   Second, agricultural runoff is the major component of NPS pollution largely because of \nthe choices and behavior of many small farmers. The main goal of the farmers is to increase \nagricultural production in the most cost-effective way, which suggests increasing dependence \non fertilizer and choosing low-priced, single-ingredient fertilizers over high-priced, compound \nfertilizers. With income growth, domestic demand for livestock products has been increasing \nquickly, which has led to a dramatic rise in livestock production in rural PRC. While this has \nincreased rural incomes, the PRC\u2019s livestock industry is characterized by numerous small and \nmedium-sized producers with few incentives to preserve the environment. Therefore, unlike \npoint-source regulations, NPS pollution control must address many small polluters with limited \nincome-earning  potential.  It  is  essential  to  understand  their  incentives  and  choices  before \ndesigning and implementing sound policy interventions. Moreover, NPS pollution management \nneeds to interact and be coordinated with policies in other sectors, such as agriculture and \nwater resources, which significantly affect the polluters\u2019 decision making.    \n \n7.   Third, while a range of policy instruments are available for NPS pollution control, it is \nunclear which ones\u2014individually or in combination\u2014will work effectively and efficiently in a \ndeveloping country. The potential instruments include direct regulations (e.g., mandatory use of \ncertain practices), economic incentives (e.g., taxes and subsidies, eco-compensation), liability \nrules,  and  education  campaigns.  Based  on  the  experiences  and  evidence  accumulated  in \ndeveloped countries, critical analysis is needed to demonstrate the feasibility, constraints, and \neffectiveness of different instruments for NPS pollution management in the PRC. Since the \npolluters  are  numerous  small  farmers  with  low  incomes,  an  NPS  pollution  management \nframework also needs to achieve a balance between environmental preservation and economic \ndevelopment. Attention should be paid to those policies and arrangements that will benefit the \nfarmers in the long term, directly or indirectly, while improving the quality of the environment. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n8.  The TA will address the technical and policy challenges of NPS pollution control in the \nPRC. Advances in NPS pollution monitoring and measurement will provide a solid technical \nbasis for NPS pollution management. An NPS pollution management framework that fits the \nPRC\u2019s situation and balances the benefits of environmental improvement and development \nneeds will contribute to NPS pollution control and sustainable development in rural areas. The \nTA will build on the findings and achievements of a previous ADB TA for the Study of Control \nand Management of Rural Nonpoint Source Pollution, which produced a draft regulation on \npollution prevention and control on livestock production and a medium-term action plan for rural \n ", "  3 \nNSP pollution control.6 Further, the previous TA recognizes an integrated approach that aims to \nchange farmers\u2019 behavior as the best way to control and reduce NSP pollution. The proposed \nTA  will  follow  up  these  policy  recommendations  and  develop  an  evidence-based  and \nimplementable NPS pollution management framework. \n \n9.  With the available resources, a case study of one of the key watersheds is advisable. \nThe  findings  can  then  be  scaled  up  to  the  national  level.  Chao  Lake  is  the  fifth-largest \nfreshwater lake in the PRC with a surface area of 776 square kilometers and lake basin area of \n13,350 square kilometers. The lake is the major source of drinking water for 6.3 million residents \nin  the  surrounding  cities  and  towns,  and  a  source  of  water  for  irrigation  and  industrial \nproduction.  Chao  Lake  basin  has  been  severely  polluted  since  the  1990s.  NPS  pollution \ndischarge resulting from the intensification of agricultural practices and the dramatic increase in \nlivestock  production  is one  of the major  challenges.  Chao  Lake  is  one  of the  operational \npriorities of ADB in the PRC. A loan project that is under processing, the proposed Anhui Chao \nLake  Environmental  Rehabilitation  Project,  aims  to  introduce  an  integrated  approach  to \naddressing Chao Lake pollution, including NPS pollution. Another reason for choosing Chao \nLake for the TA is to enable resource sharing and promote efficiencies. Using Chao Lake as the \nTA  project\u2019s  case  study  may  contribute to  the  loan  project  by  developing  and testing  the \nmethodology  for  NPS  pollution  monitoring  and  measurement  through  data  and  knowledge \nsharing. The loan project may also help the TA project by providing efficient administrative \nsupport from the project management office. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The TA will contribute to a reduced NPS pollution in key lakes and reservoirs with \nemissions of ammonia nitrogen decreased by 15% from 2010 levels by 2018. The outcome of \nthe  TA  will  be  improved  NPS  pollution  management  and  control,  with  the  draft  NPS \nmanagement framework adopted in one MEP management notice on NPS pollution by 2014. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA\u2019s main outputs are: (i) a comprehensive review of international practices and \nexperiences in NPS pollution control is conducted; (ii) an in-depth technical study on NPS \npollution monitoring and measurement is conducted; (iii) a draft NPS pollution management \nframework for key lakes and reservoirs is prepared; and (iv) a knowledge product identifying the \ncauses of NPS pollution and discussing challenges in and policy recommendations for NPS \npollution control is prepared. \n \n12.   Key  activities  to  achieve  the  outputs  are  the  following:  (i)  review  literature  on \ninternational practices and experiences in NPS pollution control, focusing on the institutional, \neconomic, and environmental contexts for applying the experiences, costs, and benefits of \ndifferent  approaches;  (ii)  analyze  existing  NPS  pollution  monitoring  and  measurement \ntechniques and schemes with respect to their application contexts and costs and benefits, \ndeveloping a methodology to model NPS pollution discharge that would be feasible and cost-\neffective in the PRC, and test the methodology by calibrating a model to the Chao Lake basin \n(or sub-basin); (iii) collect detailed data on existing policies and institutions for NPS pollution \nmanagement,  agricultural  practices  by  farm  households,  and  waste  treatment  of  livestock \nproducers through access to databases, site visits, focus group discussions, and household \n                                                \n6 ADB. 2002.

Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $480,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources).  The  government  will  provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff time, access to data sources, assistance to \nfield trips, office space, use of facilities, and logistical support. The cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.   The Department of Pollution Control of the MEP will be the executing agency for the TA. \nA project management office will be set up within the MEP and will be responsible for day-to-\nday TA activities, including overseeing the TA consultants\u2019 work plans, reviewing their outputs, \nand coordinating with the consultants on the preparation of the workshops. TA implementation \nwill be closely coordinated with other government agencies such as the Ministry of Agriculture \nand the Ministry of Water Resources, as well as local governments in Anhui province. \n \n15.  The  TA  project  will  be  implemented  over  24  months,  tentatively  scheduled  from  1 \nJanuary 2012 to 31 December 2013. The TA requires an estimated 49 person-months of \nconsulting services, comprising 9 person-months of international consultants and 40 person-\nmonths of national consultants. The consultants will include an international NPS  pollution \nspecialist and team leader, an international water pollution management specialist, a national \nenvironmental policy specialist and deputy team leader, a national NPS pollution specialist, a \nnational  water  pollution management  specialist,  a  national  agriculture  specialist,  a  national \nagricultural policy specialist, and a national environmental economist. The outline terms of \nreference for consulting services is in Appendix 3.  \n \n16.  ADB  will engage the consultants through a consulting firm,  in accordance with the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time), using the quality- \nand cost-based selection method with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10. The simplified technical \nproposal approach will be used to assess the qualifications of the bidding firms because the \nstudy  involves  complicated  methodology  and  needs  to  be  well  planned  and  coordinated. \nEquipment for research and field investigation, including computers, cameras, and recorders, \nwill be procured following ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time), \nand will be turned over to the Department of Pollution Control upon completion of the TA \nactivities.  The  proceeds  of  the  TA  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010 as amended from time to time). \n \n \nIV.
