INTRODUCTION  \n \n1.  In response to requests by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)+31 \nfinance ministers to support the development of early warning systems (EWSs) for detecting \neconomic and financial vulnerabilities, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved small-\nscale  regional  technical  assistance  (TA)  in  June  2001.2  Under  this  TA,  a  regional  EWS \nprototype was developed. The preliminary results of the prototype were presented to officials \nfrom the ministries of finance and the central banks/monetary authorities of the ASEAN+3 \ncountries at the Workshop on Regional Early Warning Systems organized jointly by ADB, the \nBank of Thailand, and the ASEAN Secretariat on 13-14 December 2001 in Bangkok, Thailand. \nUsing the EWS prototype, ADB has started to prepare a vulnerability assessment report (VAR) \nthat analyzes emerging economic and financial sector vulnerabilities in the region.  The first \nVAR entitled \u201cAn Assessment of Current Economic and Financial Vulnerability in East Asia\u201d was \npresented at the ASEAN+3 Finance Deputies Meeting in Myanmar in April 2002. Based on the \nfeedback  received  from  the  workshop  participants  and  the  ASEAN+3  Finance  Deputies \nMeeting,  ADB  has  further  improved  the  prototype.  The  improved  EWS  prototype  will  be \ndiscussed and finalized at the joint ADB/People\u2019s Bank of China/ASEAN Secretariat Workshop \non Regional Early Warning Systems scheduled for 13 December 2002 in Beijing, People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC).   \n2.  In the joint ministerial statement issued at their meeting in May 2002 in Shanghai, PRC, \nthe ASEAN+3 finance ministers indicated their desire to see the early implementation of the \nEWS prototype in their countries. This TA is proposed in response to this joint ministerial \nstatement and further discussion with the ASEAN Secretariat, with a view to facilitating the \nimplementation of the regional EWS prototype developed under the small-scale regional TA, \nthereby  continuing  ADB\u2019s  support  for  the  ASEAN+3  group\u2019s  efforts  to  strengthen  regional \neconomic monitoring and its broader objective to promote regional monetary and financial \ncooperation. The key objectives, scope, financing plan, and implementation arrangements of the \nTA are reflected in this paper.3 The TA framework is attached as Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The 1997 Asian financial crisis underscored the role of effective economic and financial \nsurveillance,  not  only  at  the  national  and  global  levels  but  also  at  the  regional  level,  in \nmaintaining  stability  and  sustaining  growth  in  a  highly  globalized  economic  environment.  \nRecognizing this, several initiatives have been taken after the crisis both within and among \ncountries in Asia to strengthen economic and financial risk management mechanisms and \nmonetary and financial cooperation. The Manila Framework Group involving 14 countries in the \nAsia and Pacific region was formed in November 1997 for the overriding purpose of regional \nsurveillance. The ASEAN Surveillance Process (ASP) was established in October 1998 by the \nASEAN member countries to strengthen policymaking capacity within the ASEAN group, based \non  the  principles  of  peer  review  and  mutual  interest.  ASP  provides  for  the  monitoring  of \nexchange rates, macroeconomic aggregates, and social and sector policies. Under the Process, \nthe ASEAN finance ministers meet twice a year for policy coordination. A further important \n                                                 \n1  Includes the 10 ASEAN members (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, \nMalaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam) plus People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and \nRepublic of Korea. \n2  ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance for an ASEAN+3 Framework for the Development of Early Warning Systems. \nManila.  \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 4 April 2002. ", "2 \ninitiative  was  the  ASEAN+3  Surveillance  Process,  formalized  in  November  1999  and  now \nrenamed the ASEAN+3 Economic Review and Policy Dialogue, under which the ASEAN+3 \nfinance ministers meet twice a year to exchange information and discuss policy issues.  \n \n4.  At their May 2000 meeting held in Chiang Mai, Thailand, the ASEAN+3 finance ministers \ndeveloped the Chiang Mai Initiative, which calls for, among others, an expanded ASEAN swap \narrangement  that  would  include  all  ASEAN  countries;  a  network  of  bilateral  swap  and \nrepurchase agreement facilities among ASEAN countries, PRC, Japan, and Republic of Korea; \nand the establishment of an appropriate mechanism (EWS) that could enhance the ability to \nprovide financial stability in the East Asian region. The ASEAN+3 finance ministers further \nhighlighted their determination to carry forward the process of establishing EWS in the joint \nministerial  statement  issued  when  they  met  in  Honolulu  in  May  2001.  Subsequently,  they \nrequested ADB\u2019s assistance in developing a regional EWS prototype.    \n \n5.  ADB has been supporting these regional initiatives ever since they were started. In early \n1999, ADB established the Regional Economic Monitoring Unit (REMU) as a focal point for \nsupporting  the  efforts  of  its  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  to  strengthen  regional \neconomic  monitoring  and  to  promote  monetary  and  financial  cooperation.  Since  its \nestablishment, REMU has been supporting the Manila Framework Group, ASP, and ASEAN+3 \nEconomic Review and Policy Dialogue through the preparation of high frequency reports and \nspecial studies, capacity building, and promotion of policy dialogue. In response to the requests \nfrom the ASEAN+3 finance ministers to develop a regional EWS prototype, ADB approved the \nsmall-scale regional TA in June 2001. The purpose of the TA was to support collaborative \nefforts among the ASEAN+3 countries leading to the development of a regional EWS that would \nhelp  detect  emerging  macroeconomic,  financial,  and  corporate  sector  vulnerabilities,  in  an \nattempt to prevent financial crises in the future. The TA financed (i) the development of a \nregional EWS prototype, and (ii) two workshops participated in by ministry of finance and central \nbank officials from the ASEAN+3 countries to discuss and finalize the prototype model. \n \n6.  The  regional  EWS  prototype  developed  under  the  previous  TA  consists  of  (i)  a \nnonparametric EWS model, and (ii) a parametric EWS model. The two EWS models, which \nfollow the latest developments in the field, were developed based on data for East Asian \ncountries, making them more suited for use by the regional economies. The preliminary results \nshow that their performance is reasonably good. A natural extension of ADB assistance in this \narea is to help DMCs in the ASEAN+3 group to implement the EWS prototype and make it \noperational. This would involve making necessary modifications to the regional EWS prototype \nto suit individual countries\u2019 circumstances, developing special computer software, and training \nconcerned government officials to operate EWS models. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n7.  The main objective of the present TA is to continue ADB\u2019s support for collaborative \nefforts among the ASEAN+3 countries to develop EWS models against potential economic and \nfinancial sector vulnerability, as part of a broader set of self-help arrangements involving the \nexchange of information, economic monitoring, and policy dialogue. Specifically, the TA will \nassist  DMCs  in  the  ASEAN+3  group  to  implement  and  operationalize  the  regional  EWS \nprototype developed under the earlier TA.   \n ", "    3 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The  present  TA  will  cover  DMCs  in  the  ASEAN+3  group,  i.e.,  Cambodia,  PRC, \nIndonesia,  Republic  of  Korea,  Lao  People's  Democratic  Republic,  Malaysia,  Myanmar, \nPhilippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n9.  The TA will finance (i) the modification of the regional EWS prototype developed under \nthe earlier TA to suit individual countries\u2019 circumstances, leading to the development of country-\nspecific  EWS  models;  (ii)  the  development  of  special  computer  software  and  operational \nmanuals; and (iii) training of concerned government officials of participating countries to operate \nthe EWS models. Possible modifications of the prototype include exploring alternative data \nsources (e.g., use of national data vs. international sources of data and access to confidential \ncountry data), fine-tuning model variables (e.g., the relevance or irrelevance of certain variables \nto a country-specific model), and accommodating specific requests from governments.   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.  The total estimated cost of the TA is $300,000, of which $250,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The governments of participating countries will \nprovide  counterpart  contributions  in  the  form  of  salaries  of  local  staff  to  be  trained  to \noperationalize the EWS, office accommodation, equipment, and other overhead expenses in \nkind, estimated at $50,000 equivalent. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n11.  ADB has supported the establishment of national surveillance units in the ministries of \nfinance, so far, of six ASEAN member countries, namely, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam.4  In countries where they exist, \nnational  surveillance  units  will  be  the  implementing  agencies  for  the  TA.  In  others, \nimplementation will be the responsibility of designated agencies. REMU will be the executing \nagency for the TA.    \n \n12.  The  TA  will  be  carried  out  over  18  months  by  REMU  staff  with  the  assistance  of \ninternational and domestic consultants, who will help to develop country-specific EWS on the \nbasis of the regional prototype, develop special computer software, conduct training workshops, \nand provide on-site training to concerned government officials. The terms of reference for \nconsultants  are  in  Appendix  3.  The  TA  will  require  approximately  5.5  person-months  of \ninternational consulting services and 5.5 person-months of domestic consulting services spread \nover the period of the TA. One of the international consultants will be a computer programmer \nwho will help to develop special computer programs for the EWS models and operational \nmanuals.  Other  international  consultants  will  be  economists  with  specialist  knowledge  of \neconomic surveillance and with experience in the East Asian region. One of the domestic \nconsultants  will  be  a  computer  programmer  who  will  assist  the  international  consultant  to \ndevelop special computer software for EWS models and operational manuals. Other domestic \nconsultants will be economists/statisticians with extensive experience in economic and financial \n                                                 \n4 The national surveillance units are responsible for providing data and analytical inputs to the ASEAN Surveillance \nCoordination Unit located at the ASEAN Secretariat. Under Technical Assistance for Capacity Building of Ministries \nof Finance in Selected DMCs for the ASEAN Surveillance Process; Technical Assistance for Capacity Building of \nMinistries of Finance in Selected DMCs for the ASEAN Surveillance Process (Phase II); and Technical Assistance \nfor Capacity Building of Ministries of Finance in Selected DMCs for the ASEAN Surveillance Process (Part II), ADB \nprovides capacity building support to these units in the form of training workshops, establishment of databases, \nand provision of equipment.
