INTRODUCTION \n1.  Since 1997, the Independent Evaluation Department (IED) and its predecessors, the \nOperations Evaluation Department and the Operations Evaluation Office, have administered \numbrella  or  facility-type  technical  assistance  (TA)  projects  to  support  a  yearly  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  program  of  high-level  evaluations  involving  multiple  countries, \nsectors, and themes.1 The first of the two research and development TA projects of this kind \nplanned for 2012 was approved in August 2012.2 It covered select evaluations from IED\u2019s \nderived program from operations (for example, country and regional evaluations and sector \nassessments) and the knowledge program from its Board-approved 2012\u20132014 work program.3 \nThe TA for Selected Evaluation Studies for 2012, Phase 2 is the second IED research and \ndevelopment TA project for 2012. 4 It will support a further round of evaluation studies from the \nsame program cycle comprising three special evaluation studies in IED's 2013 work program \nthat  will  assess  ADB\u2019s  performance  in  climate  change  management,  enhancing  good \ngovernance, and promoting inclusive growth.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  For Asia and the Pacific to sustain recent achievements in economic growth and poverty \nreduction,  the  region  must  continue  to  address  (i)  development  gaps  within  and  between \ncountries in the region, including growing disparities between rural and urban areas and coastal \nand inland regions; (ii) inequitable access to new technology, education, infrastructure, and \ninvestment; and (iii) the impacts of climate change, such as drought, floods, and threats to food \nsecurity. Growth must be inclusive and environmentally sustainable if it is to remain viable over \nthe long term. Under Strategy 2020 adopted in 2008, ADB supports three complementary \ndevelopment agendas: inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and \nregional  integration.6  ADB  has  designated  governance  as  a  key  driver  of  change  in \nimplementing Strategy 2020.  \n \n3.  The  Strategy  2020 results  framework  and  ADB\u2019s  annual  review  of  its  performance \n \nagainst it have put development effectiveness at the core of ADB operations.7 This TA will help \nthe IED provide assessments and feedback on the effectiveness of ADB operations in pursuing \nthe priorities and targets of Strategy 2020 in three important areas. \n \n4.  Promoting inclusive economic growth. By promoting inclusive growth, ADB aims to \nstem rising inequality and reduce poverty in the region by ensuring that opportunities and \nbenefits of sustained economic growth are accessed equitably by all segments of the population \nin its developing member countries (DMCs). Strategy 2020 shifted ADB to the inclusive growth \ndevelopment approach from a pro-poor growth strategy that had guided its operations since \n                                                 \n1 High-level evaluations include major evaluations such as special, real-time, and impact evaluations; evaluation \nknowledge studies; and country and regional evaluations. \n2 ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance for Selected Evaluation Studies for 2012, Phase 1. Manila (TA 8134-REG, \n$750,000, approved on 10 August). \n3 The 2012\u22122014 work program was discussed and endorsed by the ADB Board\u2019s Development Effectiveness \nCommittee  on  29  September  2011  and  approved  by  the  ADB  Board  of  Directors  on  7  December  2011. \nhttp://www.adb.org/site/evaluation/ied/work-program \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 15 August 2012. \n5   All three special evaluations are 2013 deliverables in the Board-approved 2012\u20132014 work program. Their priority \nas firm 2013 deliverables has been reaffirmed in the 2013\u22122015 work program exercise that was endorsed by the \nDevelopment Effectiveness Committee on 10 October 2012, for Board approval in December 2012.  \n6  ADB. 2008.

Manila.  http://www.adb.org/documents/ \ndevelopment-effectiveness-review-2011-report \n ", "2 \n \n1999.8 The shift was intended to increase the size and improve the distribution of economic \nbenefits through sustained growth, human capital development, and the provision of safety nets. \nThe evaluation under this TA will assess the relevance and effectiveness of the preliminary \noutcomes of Strategy 2020's inclusive growth agenda. It will also examine how the transition of \nthe strategic focus from pro-poor to inclusive economic growth has influenced ADB\u2019s operations \nas it continues to pursue its mission of poverty reduction. \n \n5.  Enhancing good governance. ADB has emphasized good governance as a key driver \nof change in pursuit of its priorities under Strategy 2020. The strategic framework for ADB's \ngovernance and anticorruption work is provided by its governance and anticorruption policies \nand the Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan (GACAP II) adopted in 2005.9 \nWhile ADB\u2019s R-paper on Governance: Sound Development Management sets a broad agenda, \nGACAP II takes a risk-based approach and seeks to enable ADB and its DMCs to design and \ndeliver better quality projects through improvements in (i) country partnership strategies for \nsocial  and  economic  development;  (ii)  program  and  project-level  design;  (iii)  program  and \nproject-level administration and management; and (iv) institutional level skills, capacities, and \noperational  practices.10  The  study  will  assess  the  relevance  and  effectiveness  of  ADB's \ngovernance policy and operations over time. This will include an evaluation of GACAP II areas \nof  emphasis  (improving  public  financial  management  and  procurement  and  combating \ncorruption). \n \n6.  Climate  proofing  the  development  process.  Based  on  a  wide  consensus  in  the \ninternational  scientific  community,  it  has  become  increasingly  clear  that  climate  change \nmitigation actions need to be intensified several-fold to preempt disastrous climate change and \nthat mitigation activities will need to be augmented by adaptation.11 In response, ADB has \nsought to mainstream climate change management in its operations. In addition to activities to \nmitigate climate change it initiated in 2005\u20132006 (with the launch of the Energy Efficiency \nInitiative  and  Carbon Market  Initiative),  ADB  has intensified  its  adaptation  interventions by \ninstituting  region-wide  climate  change  implementation  plans  in  each  of  its  five  regions  of \noperation. The study will evaluate ADB\u2019s completed and ongoing climate change mitigation and \nadaptation programs. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact of the TA will be improved development effectiveness of ADB operations, \npolicies, strategies, and business processes. Its expected outcome will be increased use of \nevaluation findings, lessons, and recommendations by the ADB Board of Directors and the \nBoard\u2019s Development Effectiveness Committee in particular, and by ADB Management. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2001.

Manila. http://www2.adb.org/documents/policies/ltsf/ \ndefault.asp \n9 GACAP II outlines a comprehensive risk-based approach to managing governance and fighting corruption. It  \nrefocused efforts to achieve results in three priority areas in the sectors where ADB operates: improving public \nfinancial  management,  strengthening  procurement  systems,  and  combating  corruption. \n(http://www.adb.org/themes/governance/action-plan) \n10 ADB. 1995.

Climate Change 2007, the Fourth Assessment Report of the \nUnited Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Geneva \n ", "3 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will support three special evaluation studies (SESs) that will assess ADB\u2019s \noperations  in  (i)  climate  change  management,  (ii)  enhancing  good  governance,  and  (iii) \npromoting  inclusive  growth.  It  will  also  support  the  dissemination  of  evaluation  knowledge \nproducts. The evaluation process will begin with the preparation by an evaluation study team of \na concept paper, including consultant terms of reference.12 After approval of the concept by the \ndirector general of the IED, an evaluation approach paper (EAP) will be drafted to describe each \nstudy and its coverage, including the countries selected for case studies and the proposed \ndissemination plan for each study.13 All major IED evaluations are intended to provide inputs for \nmajor policy and operational decisions by ADB\u2019s Board and Management. IED will schedule the \nstudies to meet the timeline of these decisions.14 In this particular case, the three SES will serve \nas key inputs for Management review of Strategy 2020 planned for 2015 and IED\u2019s validation of \nManagement\u2019s review (also planned for 2015). Once completed, major evaluation reports will be \ncirculated and discussed by the Development Effectiveness Committee.  \n \n9.  Inclusive growth: What is it? Why does it matter? This SES will seek to (i) present a \ngeneral understanding of inclusive growth and evidence of where and how it has been achieved \nacross DMCs, (ii) assess ADB's support for inclusive growth in its DMCs, (iii) identify lessons \nlearned from ADB's support to promote inclusive growth in various contexts; and (iv) provide \nguidance  for  ADB's  future  work  in  inclusive  growth.15  The  study  will  comprise  background \npapers on inclusive growth and relevant interventions; a portfolio review of completed and \nongoing projects; a review of relevant sector work; and around four in-depth country case \nstudies, with Bangladesh, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka now tentative candidates for \nthese undertakings. The SES findings will inform future ADB work and be used to assess the \nrelevance and effectiveness of the preliminary outcomes of Strategy 2020's inclusive growth \nagenda. \n \n10.  Enhancing good governance in ADB\u2019s public sector operations. The study will \ncover four areas.16 First, it will review ADB\u2019s portfolio and performance.17 Secondly, desk studies \nsupported by country case studies will be used to assess ADB support to sector reforms. \nThirdly, an institutional phase will (i) study ADB\u2019s governance policy and subsequent action \nplans, with a focus on the current GACAP II period; and (ii) assess the relevance of ADB\u2019s \ngovernance policy and approach going forward. Finally, the SES will include a literature review \nand preparation of background papers on new approaches to governance and on public sector \nmanagement, as well as the nexus between public and private sector involvement, particularly \nin utility sector management. \n \n                                                 \n12 Consultant recruitment may begin after the concept note is reviewed and endorsed by the IED leadership team, \nwhich includes the IED director general. \n13 The draft EAP is being reviewed by peers and discussed in an IED-wide meeting chaired by the IED director \ngeneral.  The final version will take into account comments on all aspects of the evaluation approach. \n14 IED has introduced formal interdepartmental consultation before final approval of an EAP by the IED director \ngeneral. The IED will consider comments from ADB to the extent possible and, if necessary, make changes to the \nEAP and publish this in its website (http://www.adb.org/site/evaluation/ongoing-evaluations). \n15 The proposed study will cover the period from 2000 to 2011. \n16 This SES is a requirement under the Asian Development Fund XI implementation plan. \n17 This will include a review of trends in the structure and performance of ADB\u2019s governance and public sector \nmanagement  portfolio  since  the  Board  approved  governance  policy  in  1995  (http://www.adb.org/documents/ \npromoting-good-governance-adbs-medium-term-agenda-and-action-plan).  The  study  will  also  examine  ADB \nsupport to sector governance reform, including reform in the energy, water, telecommunications, and transport \nsectors. Special attention will be given to reform support, such as capacity building and institutional support, and \nperformance of the portfolio. The SES will assess the relevance and effectiveness of GACAP II, including its risk \nassessment approach and the relevance to ADB of the new governance agenda, particularly in the areas of \ndomestic accountability and transparency (http://www.adb.org/themes/governance/overview). \n ", "4 \n \n11.  ADB\u2019s support for climate change management. The SES will focus on the following: \n(i) policy dialogue and TA to integrate mitigation and adaptation considerations and low-carbon \ndevelopment strategies; (ii) estimates of greenhouse gas emission reduction from energy sector \nprojects  supported  by  ADB;  (iii)  the  establishment  of  priorities  for  expansion  of  energy \ninfrastructure, and clean energy investments on the supply and demand sides; (iv) analysis of \nclimate change vulnerabilities to adjust sector strategies and increase sector resilience; (v) \nclimate proofing of infrastructure development projects; and (vi) attention to the needs of such \nvulnerable groups as the poor, women, and minorities. The SES will draw on the findings of \nother work on mitigation and attempt to evaluate adaptation interventions that address long-term \nclimate change by transforming existing systems and practices. \n \n12.  Dissemination  of  knowledge  products.  To  make  its  evaluation  products  more \naccessible and influential, the IED will continue to disclose, disseminate, and share evaluation \nfeedback on performance and lessons. Using the SES results, it will prepare and publish \nsyntheses, briefs, and occasional papers tailored to widen readership and provide continuous \nfeedback on ADB\u2019s operations, strategies, and policies. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013IV). The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. The IED will implement it and supervise all \nplanned studies. The studies will require the services of 16 international consultants for about \n24 person-months and 16 national consultants for about 25 person-months.18 The outline terms \nof reference for consulting requirements are in Appendix 3. More detailed terms of reference for \neach  study  will  be  developed  for  the  EAP.  ADB  will  engage  consultants  primarily  on  an \nindividual basis in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). The specific services required from consulting firms (e.g., surveys) will be \nconsidered during preparation of the EAP. \n \n15.  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Tracking of study \nprogress will be recorded through internal monitoring sheets on key milestone events, mission \nback-to-office reports, and ad hoc presentations or consultations on evaluation study findings. \nThe TA outputs will be disseminated in accordance with IED\u2019s evaluation policy, particularly with \nregard to public disclosure, dissemination, and lessons. The TA is scheduled to start 31 October \n2012 and expected to end by 31 October 2014. Implementation arrangements will be flexible to \naccommodate alterations in IED\u2019s work program or changes in response to priorities under \nStrategy 2020 and assistance provided from Asian Development Fund X and XI. ADB will obtain \na no-objection from the DMC government before starting any activity financed under this TA in \nthe territory of that country. \n \n                                                 \n18 The number of consultants and their inputs are indicative. Consultant requirements will be reviewed during the \nconcept paper stage and finalized in the EAP. \n ", "5 \nIV.  DECISION \n16.

The SES evaluation team will require the services of two \ninternational consultants (total of 5 person-months) to undertake background papers as part of \nthe literature review phase of the study. The literature review will include desk studies of sectors \nto identify the types of sector reforms supported by ADB and the type of support provided in \nDMCs,  which  will  then  be  followed  up  for  assessment  by  the  country  case  studies.4  One \nliterature review will look at new approaches to supporting governance, including that being \ntaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on transparency and \naccountability. A second desk study will look at public sector management and issues in public \nutility reform (i.e., the nexus between public and private participation, particularly in utility sector \nmanagement.) A third international consultant (2 person-months) will assess the relevance and \neffectiveness of ADB\u2019s Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan, including its risk \nassessment approach generally and in its main areas of emphasis (e.g., improving project \nfinancial management and procurement and combating corruption). This consultant will also \nprepare  an  overview  of  all  recent  reviews  conducted  by  ADB's  Regional  Sustainable \nDevelopment Department. The consultant team will be expected to contribute useful lessons \nand recommendations from findings for the SES report, including pointers and guidance for \nimproving daily routine operations (from design through business processing to approval) and \npolicy making.  \n \n9.  National  consultants.  National  evaluation  consultants  based  at  ADB  headquarters \n(total of 6 person-months) will undertake a portfolio review of ADB support for governance since \n1995. The consultants will collect, collate, and analyze ADB project data in governance from \n1995 to 2012. They will also carry out a desk review of performance. The evaluation study will \nalso require in-country national consultants in each country (total of 4 person-months) to (i) \npresent an overview of the relevance and implementation of ADB\u2019s strategy and interventions; \n(ii) assess and rate the achievement of project and program objectives and the delivery of the \nprogram in the context of enhancing good governance in sovereign operations; (iii) comment on \n                                                 \n3 The SES is one of four IED evaluations for action under the Asian Development Fund XI implementation plan and is \nto be delivered in 2013. \n4 The desk studies will identify the type of reforms that ADB supports and the objectives these reforms are meant to \nachieve. The studies will consider the significance of these reforms to fundamental change in the way sectors are \nmanaged. The desk studies will be  supported by country case studies, particularly in considering the beneficial or \nnegative effects of these reforms on people. One desk study will focus on public utilities (i.e., the nexus between \npublic and private sector involvement or participation in public utilities, especially in managing these). \n ", "Appendix 3  11 \nADB\u2019s institutional positioning and performance in promoting good governance in its operations; \n(iv) organize and facilitate focus group discussions, workshops, and meetings; and (v) identify \nimportant issues and lessons in promoting good governance in ADB\u2019s sector operations. \n \nC.  Special Evaluation Study on ADB\u2019s Support for Climate Change Management (8 \nperson-months international and 8 person-months national). \n10.  The  SES  will  require  the  services  of  four  international  consultants:  a  development \neconomist; two climate change specialists, including a clean energy specialist; and a peer \nreviewer. The team of international experts will be supported by an ADB headquarters-based \nnational evaluation consultant and four in-country national consultants from each of the selected \nstudy countries. \n \n11.  International consultants. The four international consultants (total of 8 person-months) \nwill help evaluate ongoing ADB\u2019s adaptation programs, including interventions that address \nlong- term climate change impacts by transforming existing systems and practices and those \nthat seek to address existing adaptation deficits or manage only incremental changes to climate \nvulnerability.  The  consultants  will  assess  the  relevance,  responsiveness,  effectiveness, \nsustainability, and impact of ADB support to climate change management, focusing on (i) policy \ndialogue  and  technical  assistance  to  integrate  mitigation  considerations  and  low-carbon \ndevelopment strategies, (ii) greenhouse gas emission reduction from energy sector projects, \nand (iii) priorities for expanding energy infrastructure and clean energy investments.  \n \n12.  During field visits to the selected study countries, the consultants will undertake key \ninformant interviews and conduct stakeholder surveys on the outcome and impact of ADB \nsupport and discuss climate change-related issues and concerns with executing agencies and \nother government and nongovernment entities, as appropriate. The consultants will also help \nassess the validity of four dimensions of ADB\u2019s climate change-related development strategies \nin  each  study  country:  (i)  policy  dialogue  to  integrate  adaptation  considerations  into \ndevelopment strategies; (ii) analysis of climate change vulnerabilities to adjust sector strategies \nand increase sector resilience; (iii) climate proofing of infrastructure development projects; and \n(iv) attention to the needs of such vulnerable groups as the poor, women, and minorities. The \nstudy will draw on applicable findings of other IED work on mitigation. The consultant team will \ncontribute useful lessons and recommendations, including pointers and guidance for improving \ndaily  routine  operations  (from  design  through  business processing to  approval)  and  policy \nmaking.  \n \n13.  National  consultants.  An  ADB  headquarters-based  national  consultant  (3  person-\nmonths) will be recruited in Manila to help the SES evaluation team carry out desk studies, \nincluding data collection analyses and a review of project documents. The in-country national \nconsultants (total of 5 person-months) will preferably have previous exposure to climate change-\nrelated  development  issues  in  the  study  country.  They  will  be  recruited  to  (i)  present  an \noverview  of  the  relevance  and  implementation  of  ADB\u2019s  climate  change  strategy  and \ninterventions; (ii) assess and rate the achievement of project and program objectives and the \ndelivery of the program in support of climate change management; (iii) comment on ADB\u2019s \ninstitutional  positioning  and  performance  in  climate  change  management  in  a  sector;  (iv) \norganize and facilitate focus group discussions, workshops, and meetings; and (v) identify \nimportant climate change-related issues and lessons in a sector\u2019s operations. \n \n "], "metadata": {"Author": "Asian Development Bank", "CreationDate": "D:20121023091609+08'00'", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2", "Keywords": "rdta, 46210, research, development, adb, technical assistance, evaluation, evaluation studies, ied, independent evaluation, adb projects, gacap ii, governance, development gaps, development effectiveness", "ModDate": "D:20121109172401+08'00'", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 9.5.2 (Windows)", "Subject": "The technical assistance report (TAR) is a decision document for the technical assistance project, Selected Evaluation Studies for 2012 Phase 2, containing issues, impacts, outcomes, methodology and key activities as well as cost and financing and implementation arrangements presented to ADB\u2019s Board of Directors or Management for approval.", "Title": "Selected Evaluation Studies for 2012, Phase 2: Technical Assistance Report"}}
