THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  The proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) grant is designed to complement the \nensuing loan of up to $20 million loan to New Hope Singapore Pte. Ltd. (NHS), for the New Hope \nCOVID-19 Working Capital Support Project (Regional).1 The loan will support NHS\u2019 emergency \nresponse operating expenses and increased working capital needs in nine countries of South and \nSoutheast Asia during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak2.  \n \n2.  The proposed TA will complement the loan by providing capacity building support to 7,200 \nwomen poultry and fish farmers in Bangladesh and the Philippines on (i) climate resilient farming \nbest practices in either poultry or aquaculture, adapted to the needs of women and the local \ncontext; and (ii) functional financial literacy, including a focus on access to credit facilities. The \ntopics are highly aligned with assisting climate resilient recovery from COVID-19 related impacts \nin the poultry and aquaculture industries, as identified in the FAST report.  The capacity building \nwill also help boost women's participation in the poultry and aquaculture industries and accelerate \ngender equality by improving their financial and technical capabilities.   \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  Climate change in South and Southeast Asia. Modelling by the Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that countries in South and Southeast Asia will \nexperience and increase in average temperatures and precipitation by the mid-21st century.3  The \nIPPC classifies Bangladesh as one of the countries which will be most affected by climate change, \nwith changing rainfall and water flow patterns being particularly impactful in a country located in \na river delta with low-lying floodplains.  Those living in poverty will be the most impacted, of which \n85% reside in rural areas.4 \n \n4.  Innovative  techniques  to  strengthen  climate  resilience  of  poultry  farming  and \naquaculture. Poultry farmers in South and Southeast Asia are experiencing higher temperatures \nfor longer period as well as more extreme precipitation patterns, both associated with climate \nchange, leading to higher animal mortality and lower farm productivity.  These effects can be \nmitigated through innovative techniques, including real-time temperature and hygrometry sensors \nand monitoring systems, insulation, passive and active poultry shed ventilation and energy-\nefficient  evaporating  cooling  systems.  These  techniques  are  increasingly  implemented  in \ndeveloped countries with warm climates (e.g. Southern US States, Australia), but their usage \nremains very limited in South and Southeast Asia. The TA will therefore train women to these \ntechniques, to ensure innovation adoption in the poultry sector.  \n \n5.  Aquaculture  is  also  experiencing  the  effects  of  climate  change,  including  ocean \nacidification in coastal zones, extreme events (more frequent and intense precipitation events, \n \n1  ADB. 2020.

Manila \n ", "2 \nfloods, droughts), climate variability, sea level rises, and surface water temperature rises5.  \nClimate change presents a large variety of risks to aquaculture depending on the local conditions, \nand  context-specific  solutions  are  critical  to  providing  farmers  with  effective  adaptation \nmeasures.6 Additionally, access to financial services and credit facilities is often a barrier to \nadoption of climate change adaptation measures by small holder fish farmers.7 The TA will focus \non adaptive measures at the farm and community level, with a primary focus on farm management \npractices  and  financial  literacy.  Farm  management  trainings  will  include  diet  and  nutrition, \nmanagement and engineering solutions, and breed selection as primary methods of improving \nclimate resilience.  The selection of thermal tolerant breeds and management of diet and nutrition \nhelps reduce the impact of climate change on farm productivity.   Management and engineering \nsolutions can reduce climate-related risk.  Financial literacy trainings will focus on farm budgets, \naccess to financial services and credit facilities, which are particularly important for those farmers \nthat may want to implement more costly adaptive. The TA will train women to these techniques \nto ensure innovation adoption in the aquaculture sector.  \n \n6.  COVID-19  recovery.  The  effects  of  the  COVID-19  crisis  and  related  containment \nmeasures have led to bottlenecks in food supply chains and the poultry and fish industries have \nbeen impacted. In Bangladesh, disruptions to supply chain disruptions and false accusations of \nchickens as a source of COVID-19 caused an unprecedented reduction in demand and farmgate \nprices plunged.8 Approximately 50% of broiler farmers were estimated to be out of business by \nMay 2020. While not impacted as dramatically as poultry, fisheries in Bangladesh experienced a \nsignificant reduction in prices especially for exports.  The largest impact on fisheries may still be \nto come, with dramatic reductions in sales of fish spawn and fingerlings. 9  The Philippines \ninstigated an early and strict community quarantine system that initially impacted supply chains, \nand lead to price fluctuations for both fish and poultry.  The government later established \u201cfood \nlanes\u201d and \u201cfood passes\u201d that allowed food and agricultural products to move unabetted.  Despite \nthese efforts, poultry prices fell dramatically by over $1 per kilogram in some areas, leading poultry \nfarmers to lobby the government for a ban on imported poultry.10 Fish prices, conversely, \nincreased above and despite price ceilings set by the government.11 \n \n7.  The TA will support economic recovery from the COVID-19 crisis for female fish and \npoultry farmers, by providing them with training to increase their productivity and profitability. \nIntegrating climate resilience considerations in the recovery process will be critical to ensure the \ncommunities build resilience to all types of future crises.  \n \n8.  South-South cooperation. The TA will build capacity in farm financial and business \nmanagement as well as climate-resilient farm management, notably by drawing upon the client\u2019s \nexperience in the PRC. Strengthening such enabling factors is critical to ensure women are able \nto successfully apply resilience building measures in their day-to-day lives. \n \n \n5  Reid GK, Gurney-Smith HJ, Flahery M, Garber AF, Forster I, Brewer-Dalton K, Knowler D, Marcogliese DJ, Chopin \nT, Moccia RD, Smith CT, De Silva S. 2019.

By focusing on women in rural environments in low-income countries, \nthe TA will target populations particularly vulnerable to the impact of climate change and in the \npost COVID-19 context. The TA will result in improved capacity to take part in farm management, \ncontributing to strengthening women\u2019s positions within farms and improving their position to \naccess financing to expand the businesses in which they are involved. Such empowerment of \nwomen in decision-making positions is critical to achieve transformational changes.  The TA will \nalso improve women\u2019s meaningful participation, including within household\u2013enterprise units. \n \n10.  Scalability of impact beyond TA scope. NHS develops extension services alongside \nmany of their subsidiaries to support their contract and customer farmers.12 As NHS is expanding \nrapidly in South and Southeast Asia, many of these extension programs are newly established \nand focus solely on basic farm management with no climate-resilient farming methods or financial \nliteracy training focus. The company anticipates the incorporation of TA products into their future \ntraining programs which would extend beyond the temporal and spatial13 scope of the TA.   \n \n11.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is aligned with \nStrategy 2030 which calls for ADB \u201cto scale up its financing for agribusiness\u201d and \u201cto promote \ngender equality in at least 75% of the number of ADB\u2019s committed operations by 2030\u201d.14 The \nproject is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategies of the three DMCs which: (i) \nsupport increasing the productivity of agriculture; (ii) support managing climate change-related \nvulnerabilities; and (iii) promote gender equality.15 \n \n12.  Consistency with sector strategy and ADB sovereign operations. The project is \nconsistent with Strategy 2030\u2019s Operational Plan for Priority 1 to addressing poverty and reducing \ninequality, Operational Plan for Priority 2 by accelerating progress in gender equality, Operational \nPlan for Priority 3 for support of climate-smart agriculture and sustainable land-use management, \nincluding supporting community-based adaptation, and Operational Plan for Priority 5 to promote \nrural  development  and  food  security.16 The  project  will  complement  sovereign  COVID-19 \nresponse projects in South and Southeast Asia17 to provide emergency response to support the \npoor and vulnerable households who have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n13.  Impacts and outcome of the TA are in line with the financing project and also focus on \naccelerating gender equality in fish and poultry farming. Impacts are: (i) tackling climate change, \n \n12 In total, NHS serves over 200,000 farmers in South and Southeast Asia, including 28,000 in Bangladesh and 23,000 \nin the Philippines. \n13 NHS has additional subsidiaries in Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Lao, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam. \n14 ADB. 2019.

Because of NHS\u2019s contract farming model, the company has a direct \nrelationship with farmers and will ensure that they fully benefit from the TA. The interests of NHS \nand the farmers are completely aligned in relation to the TA outcome, since NHS needs a \nsustainable demand for feed and, in Bangladesh, for hatchlings and chicks. NHS is committed to \npromote green and sustainable agriculture to improve standards of living for people across Asia \nin countries where they operate.  \n \n17.  NHS and ADB have agreed on the principal terms of a draft TA implementation agreement. \nThe draft agreement sets out the outcome and outputs of the TA, the amount of financing to be \nprovided by ADB, the terms of reference of the consulting firm to be appointed, the proposed \nbudget,  and  a  realistic  implementation  timetable.

The sustainable operations \nof NHS\u2019 feed mills, livestock farms, and contract farmers will ensure the stable local supply of \naffordable animal proteins, which will contribute to food security in the nine developing member \ncountries (DMCs) included in the project scope. The project will also help to preserve the \nlivelihoods of workers and smallholder farmers and will promote South-South investment and \ntrade.  \n \nThe proposed TA costs around $400,000 as follows: (i) $120,000 to train at least 3,600 female \nfarmers in climate-resilient poultry farming best practices adapted to the needs of women and the \nlocal context; (ii) $120,000 to train at least 3,600 female farmers in climate-resilient fish farming \nbest practices adapted to the needs of women and the local context; (ii) $160,000 to provide the \nsame 7,200 female farmers with financial literacy training.  \n \nThis TA seeks to increase the capacity and empowerment of women and incentivize their \ninvolvement  in the poultry  and  aquaculture  sector  across  Bangladesh  and  the  Philippines. \nDelivery of the training would be a combination of classroom-based teaching as well as hands-on \ntraining, including on-farm for women farmers. ADB strongly encourages a design that promotes \nfarmer to farmer training and knowledge sharing. Also, delivery of the trainings should be suited \nfor  participants  with  basic  level  of  literacy.  The  bidding  entities  should  demonstrate  their \nexperience in working with similar target groups and their approaches in working with all female \ngroups. \n \nInternational civil society organizations (CSOs), or coalitions/consortia of CSOs are specifically \nencouraged to apply. \n \nFor Output 1, the training will be for three full days (including preparation) and focused on \nteaching female farmers climate-resilient poultry farming best practices including:   \n(i)  work requirements for a poultry farm; \n(ii) brood management (including animal welfare); \n(iii) health management ; \n(iv) climate change and poultry farming; \n(v) preventing climate-related stress in poultry farms; and \n(vi) maintenance of farm equipment, building, and environment (including waste \nmanagement). \n \nFor Output 2, the training will be for three full days (including preparation) and focused on \nteaching female farmers climate-resilient fish farming best practices including:   \n(i)  work requirements for a fish farm; \n(ii) health management; \n(iii) climate change and fish farming; \n(iv) preventing climate-related stress in fish farms; \n(v) methods for mitigating the effects of climate change-related extreme weather events; \nand \n(vi) maintenance of farm equipment, building, and environment. \n \n ", "2 \nFor Output 3, the training will be for one full day (including preparation) and focused on teaching \nfemale farmers financial literacy covering farm finance and household finance including:  \n(i)  utilizing savings and credit; \n(ii)  simple budgeting and calculating profit; \n(iii) understanding contracts; and \n(iv) banking electronically. \n \nParticipants will be farmer-members (or spouses of farmer-members1) to which NHS sells feed or \nchicks. Women will be selected based on their experience with agricultural work, basic level of \nliteracy, basic level of physical abilities, be over the age of 18 years, and be involved in poultry or \nfish farming.
