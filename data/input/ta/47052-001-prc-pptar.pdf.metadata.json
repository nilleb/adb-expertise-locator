The  Government  of  Inner  Mongolia  Autonomous  Region  (GIMAR)  envisions  the \ndevelopment of a low-carbon and clean energy-based district heating systems, contributing to \nmore inclusive and sustainable livelihood in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (IMAR). As an \nimportant initiative, the Hohhot City Development Investment and Operation Company will test a \nwind and coal hybrid system in one of the three project sites. However, the scale of wind and \ncoal hybrid district heating is marginal in the current project design. A comprehensive study is \nneeded to clearly assess the potentials of expanding wind, and other renewable and/or clean \nenergy-based district heating. To address this important requirement, the project preparatory \ntechnical assistance (PPTA) will be implemented in two parts. The first part of the PPTA will \nrespond  to  this  need  by  conducting  a  thorough  analysis  on  the  potentials  of  clean  and \nrenewable energy-based heating systems. It will examine technical and economic feasibility of \nthe expansion of wind power and other renewable energy sources in district heating systems. It \nwill also assess the impact of low-carbon district heating with and without renewable energy \nsubsidies. The first part of the PPTA will propose and confirm possible expansion of renewable \nheating sources in the project. Since the project is classified as complex due to safeguards \nissues, part of the PPTA will pay attention on safeguards due diligence works.  \n \n2.  The second part of PPTA will (i) conduct the due diligence on confirmed scope of the \nproject;  (ii)  familiarize  the  implementing  agency  with  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s) \nprocurement  and  disbursement  procedures,  and  environment  and  social  safeguards \nrequirements; and (iii) identify project risks and support the establishment and operation of a \ncomprehensive risk management plan. \n \nB.

Interest  Rate  (ADB  Loan):  As \nindicated in the ADB Guidelines for estimate of interest during construction (IDC), the 5-year LIBOR \nswap rate should be used, while for the financial projections, the 10-year LIBOR swap rate should be \napplied. ADB's lending spread of 0.30% per annum should be added for loans negotiated from 1 July \n2010 to 30 June 2011, and 0.40% per annum for those negotiated on or after 1 July 2011. Updates on \nindicative  LIBOR  can  be  obtained  from  the  ADB's  website  at \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/Brochures/Libor/indicative_rates.pdf.  Interest  Rate  (Domestic  Loan): \nThis should be obtained by the national consultant from the subproject enterprises. In other ADB \nprojects, the prevailing rate for long-term loans issued by the People's Bank of China is used for \nprojection purposes. Commitment Fees: Commitment fees are computed at 0.15% p.a. of the total \nundisbursed balance of the loan. There are no front-end fees. Cost Escalation Factors: For price \ncontingency  estimates,  ADB  suggested  cost  escalation  factors  should  be  used.
