Most  of  the  policy  actions  will  lead  to \nsubstantial  positive  environmental  impacts.  Any  potential  negative \nenvironmental impacts that may have resulted from increased expenditure \nin the water supply and sanitation (WSS) and health sectors have been \nadequately addressed. \n   \nProgram  The  proposed  BDSSP  comprises  two  program  loans,  an  Asian \nDescription  Development Fund (ADF) grant for the control of human immunodeficiency \n  virus/acquired  immunodeficiency  syndrome  (HIV/AIDS)  and  infectious \ndiseases, and a technical assistance (TA) loan. The Program will support \npolicy  reforms  to  improve  education,  health,  and  WSS;  finance  social \nsector performance grants to the districts; support capacity building and \ninstitutional strengthening for social service delivery in both provinces and \ndistricts; empower citizens to play a greater role in social service delivery; \nand enable the private sector to participate in public and private social \nservice delivery.  \n   \nRationale  Balochistan\u2019s social sector indicators are among the most challenging in \n  South Asia: female primary school enrollment, for example, is just above \n20%.  Balochistan  province  remains  largely  untouched  by  the  buoyant \neconomic growth witnessed in the past few years in Pakistan. Balochistan \nis the country\u2019s largest province, with nearly 44% of its surface area and a \nthinly  dispersed  population  of  around  6.5  million.  The  rugged  and \ninaccessible terrain, limited water resources for irrigation, large illiterate \npopulation,  ethnic  diversity,  and  traditional  women\u2019s  status  are  added \nchallenges to economic growth and human development in Balochistan. \nMany of these factors increase the cost of providing social services in \nBalochistan.  The  predominantly  agro-pastoral  economy  and  severe \ndroughts in the last decade have led to internal migration and increased the \nvulnerability of the poor and the women. Overexploitation of groundwater, \nthe  rapid  disappearance  of  traditional  surface  water  sources,  and  the \nlimited harvesting of surface water have further aggravated water scarcity.  \n \nHuman capital must rapidly improve for Balochistan to tap internal and \nexternal  markets,  and  capitalize  on  market-driven  economic  growth. ", "iv         \n \nBalochistan  has  made  some  progress  in  its  education  and  health \nindicators;  but  the  interplay  of  geographic,  cultural,  ethnic,  historical, \npolitical, and other factors poses governance and institutional challenges \nwith major implications for the quality of social service delivery. Balochistan \nneeds to implement governance reforms and strengthen institutions in the \nsocial  sector  to  improve  the  effectiveness  of  public  and  private  social \nservice delivery.  \n \nThe government of Balochistan is determined to pursue a robust economic \nand  human  development  path,  as  stated  in  the  Balochistan  Poverty \nReduction Strategy Paper (BPRSP). However, it has limited resources and \nflexibility to support its development needs. Large stocks of high-interest \ndebt and constrained fiscal space have limited the scope for financing \nhuman development in Balochistan. \n \nThe  challenging  social  sector  indicators,  challenges  in  social  service \nprovision, and low current investments in the social sectors justify need for \nhigher  investments  and  more  efficiency  in  the  social  sectors.  The \nBalochistan  Local  Government  Ordinance  (BLGO)  2001  has  created \ninstitutional opportunities to improve social service delivery by involving \nlocal governments and communities. However, policy reforms, institutional \nstrengthening,  and  capacity  building  of  both  managers  and  service \nproviders are needed to improve devolved social services. \n   \nImpact and  BDSSP  will  help  Balochistan  province  accelerate  progress  toward  the \nOutcomes  Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and BPRSP goals in education, \n  health, and WSS. The objectives of BDSSP are to (i) improve access to \naffordable, efficient, effective, and good-quality education, health, and WSS \nin the public and private sectors; (ii) decrease inequities in social services \nbased on income, gender, ethnicity, and geography; and (iii) strengthen \nlocal governments, the private sector, and communities to improve social \nservice delivery. \n \nThe  program  has  four  principal  policy  areas:  (i)  provincial  efficiency \nincentives, to strengthen and clarify relationships between provincial and \nlocal governments; (ii) managerial power, to strengthen the relationship \nbetween  the  local  governments  and  the  providers  of  social  services; \n(iii) citizen voice and empowerment, to strengthen the relationship between \ncitizens and policy makers, and between citizens and service providers; \nand (iv) private sector engagement in service delivery. \n \nBDSSP will provide policy reform support for province-wide devolved social \nservices (education, health, and WSS) through performance grants and \nTA.  The  Balochistan  Performance  Grant  Rules  2005  define  the \nimplementation arrangements, procedures, and monitoring and reporting \nchannels for the performance grants to be supported by BDSSP. \n   \nCost Estimates  The additional costs associated with policy and institutional reforms, and \n  measures to expedite progress toward education, health, and WSS\u2013related \nMDGs, are estimated to be at least $261 million equivalent. \n   \n ", "  v\nFinancing Plan  The  government  of  Balochistan  has  requested  financial  assistance  of \n$205  million  equivalent  comprising  $195  million  in  two  program  loans \n($130 million from ordinary capital resources [OCR] and $65 million from \nADF),  a  TA  loan  of  $5  million,  and  an  ADF  grant  of \n$5 million for the control of HIV/AIDS and infectious diseases. \n \nFinancing Plan \n($ million) \n  Source  Amount \nA.

The ADF program loan of $65 million equivalent \nwill have a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest \nrate of 1% per year during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter; and other \nterms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Financing  and  Program \nAgreements. \n \nThe Government of Pakistan will on-lend the proceeds of the loans in local \ncurrency to the government of Balochistan on terms equivalent to those \ngiven by ADB. However, the foreign currency risk will be borne by the \nGovernment of Pakistan. \n   \nADF Grant for  Balochistan\u2019s public health challenges include combating high morbidity \nHIV/AIDS and  and  mortality  from  malaria  and  tuberculosis;  preventing  the  spread  of \nInfectious  HIV/AIDS in high-risk groups, and raising general awareness of HIV/AIDS \nDiseases Control  in  a  largely  illiterate  population;  and  reducing  vaccine-preventable \nchildhood infectious diseases. A $5 million ADF grant for the control of \nHIV/AIDS  and  infectious  diseases  will  be  used  to  finance  specific \ncomponents  of  health  sector  performance  grants  that  will  have  a  high \nimpact on the prevention of HIV/AIDS, the prevention and treatment of \nmalaria  and  tuberculosis,  and  the  reduction  of  vaccine-preventable \nchildhood  illnesses.  The  grant  outputs  and  outcomes  will  be  carefully \nmonitored through the reporting mechanisms of the program loan, and \nthrough  public  expenditure  tracking  surveys  and  quantitative  service \ndelivery surveys.  \n ", "vi         \n \n \nProgram Period  The program period is from 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2009.

The PSC will be chaired by the additional \nchief secretary (development) and  will have the secretary of finance as \nalternate chair and the following as members: chief economist, secretary of \neducation,  secretary  of  health,  secretary  of  public  health  engineering, \nsecretary  of  services  and  general  administration,  secretary  of  local \ngovernment, BDSSP coordinator (PSC secretary). The representatives of \nthe ADB-supported DSP and BRMP will act as observers.  \n \nThe PPO will comprise provincial government staff (counterparts) posted \nfor the duration of the program and contracted staff recruited under the TA \nloan. A district (zila) program committee in each of the district governments \nwill oversee (i) the implementation of the policy reforms under BDSSP \ninsofar as they relate to the district governments, (ii) the TA support, and \n(iii) the performance grants under BDSSP. The district program committee \n ", "  vii\nwill be headed by the zila nazim (Chairperson of district government), with \nthe district coordination officer as the alternate chair, and will have as its \nmembers the executive district officers (EDOs) of the social sector group of \noffices (education, health, and public health engineering) and the EDO of \nfinance  and  planning  as  the  committee  secretary.  The  TMA  Program \nCommittee will be headed by the tehsil nazim with tehsil municipal officer \nas  the  alternate  chair  and  the  tehsil  (infrastructure  and  services)  as \nmember-secretary.  \n \nPUs will be set up in relevant provincial departments and in each of the 28 \ndistricts and selected TMAs that receive BDSSP performance grants. At \nthe provincial level, PUs will be set up in the finance department and the \nbureau of statistics. In the districts, a PU will be set up in the planning and \nfinance office of the district government. Consultants recruited under the \nTA loan will assist in developing and implementing policy reforms under \nBDSSP,  including  studies  and  surveys.  Nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs) or firms will be contracted by BDSSP to (i) support the bureau of \nstatistics in carrying out quantitative service delivery surveys (QSDSs), (ii) \nsupport the finance department in carrying out public expenditure tracking \nsurveys (PETSs), and (iii) conduct third-party validation of the process and \nresults of the surveys.  \n   \nProcurement,  The loan proceeds will finance the foreign exchange cost of items procured \nDisbursement,  from ADB member countries, which also produced the items, excluding \nand Counterpart  listed  ineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  multilateral  and \nFunds  bilateral sources. The program loans will be disbursed according to ADB\u2019s \n  simplified disbursement procedures and audit requirements. \n \nThe counterpart funds generated from the ADF program loan and grant will \nsupport performance grants to finance local government expenditures in \neducation, health, and WSS until 30 June 2010. The counterpart funds \ngenerated from the entire OCR loan will refinance the high-interest debt of \nthe government of Balochistan, and the fiscal space thus created will be \ndedicated to providing current budget support in devolved social sectors \nand  transferred  to  the  local  governments  under  the  provincial  finance \ncommission (PFC) award. \n   \nTechnical  The TA will (i) support sector work on specific policy reforms and improve \nAssistance Loan  sector  performance;  (ii)  strengthen  sector  planning,  management,  and \n  monitoring; (iii) develop the capacity of local governments and communities \nfor the governance of social services; and (iv) support the implementation \nof  policy  reforms,  performance  grants,  and  capacity-building  activities \nunder BDSSP. \n   \nCost Estimates  The TA project is estimated to cost $6.25 million equivalent, comprising \nand Financing  $0.18 million in foreign exchange costs and $6.07 million in local currency \nPlan of the TA  costs.  The  TA  loan  of  $5  million  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Fund \nLoan  resources will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; \nan interest rate of 1% per year during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter; \nand other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan and Project \nAgreement. The government of Balochistan will contribute $1.25 million, \n ", "viii        \n \nwhich is 20% of the total cost of the TA project. The contribution will be in \nthe form of office accommodation, counterpart staff, travel allowances and \nper diems for government counterparts, vehicle provision, and operational \nexpenses for the PPOs and PUs in the provinces and district governments. \n   \n \nPeriod of  1 July 2006 to 30 December 2010 \nUtilization under \nthe TA Loan \n   \nExecuting  P&DD, Balochistan \nAgency of the \nTA Loan \n   \nImplementation  The PSC set up for the program loan will also provide guidance for the TA.  \nArrangements \nfor the TA Loan \n   \nProcurement  All procurement under the TA will be made according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nUnder the TA  for Procurement. Contract packages valued at $500,000 equivalent or less \nLoan  will follow local competitive bidding (LCB) or, as applicable, international \n  shopping. Minor packages costing $100,000 equivalent or less may be \nprocured through LCB or direct purchase. \n   \nConsulting  Consultants  and  consulting  firms  will  be  recruited  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nServices Under  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory \nthe TA Loan  to ADB. Consultants will be hired individually or through consulting firms. \n  The  TA  Loan  will  provide  for,  among  others,  8.3  person-months  of \ninternational consultants and 104 person-months of domestic consultants. \nIn addition, 4,242 months of contract staff will be hired in the provinces and \ndistricts during the program period to help with program implementation. \n   \nProgram  The BDSSP interventions will further Balochistan\u2019s progress toward the \nBenefits and  MDGs and the social sector targets set in the BPRSP.  \nBeneficiaries   \n  BDSSP will increase funding for social services through performance grant \ntransfers and additional support for current expenditures. The performance \ngrants are designed to enable local governments to provide a flexible, \nneeds-based  response  to  local  conditions,  adopt  an  effective  demand-\ndriven  and  participatory  planning  process  to  identify  service  gaps,  and \nrationalize and develop services with full ownership of the interventions \ndecided by them. At the same time, the grants target priority investments in \nthe social sectors according to the provincial policy frameworks to ensure \nbalanced progress in an accelerated manner toward the MDGs and the \nBDSSP policy reforms. The additional support for current expenditures will \nhelp bridge critical gaps in non-salary expenditures in the social sectors. \n \nPerformance grant funding to local governments for basic social services \nand  the  introduction  of  a  package  of  minimum  essential  services  will \nparticularly  benefit  the  poor  and  vulnerable.  The  TA  will  assist  the \ngovernment of Balochistan in developing a strategy and action plan to \n ", "  ix\npromote  public-private  partnership  (PPP)  in  social  service  delivery; \ninnovating  improvements  in  the  quality,  access,  and  delivery  of  social \nservices; and evolving and implementing a self-regulatory mechanism for \nthe private sector. While programs such as BDSSP cannot directly address \nthe  issue  of  retrogressive  societal  norms  and  practices,  which  cause \nwomen  to  be  marginalized  in  Balochistan  society,  they  can  certainly \nimprove the quality of women\u2019s lives and lay the groundwork for greater \nautonomy for women in both public and private spheres. \n \nBDSSP will strengthen the local government system. Its policy reforms will \nassist the government of Balochistan in defining the role of the provincial \nsocial sector departments according to BLGO 2001. The program will help \nbuild the capacity of local councilors, including women councilors, to plan, \nimplement, and manage improvements in service delivery, and will provide \nlinkages with related activities that are ongoing. In addition, the program \nwill  further  institutionalize  the  involvement  of  the  community  and  civil \nsociety in local government affairs. \n \nPoverty in Balochistan is also marked by a general sense of powerlessness \nand a perceived lack of dignity. While BDSSP cannot directly address the \ngovernance issues that give rise to and perpetuate such feelings, program \ninitiatives aimed at removing inequities and ensuring that public services \nare managed by, and in consultation with, elected representatives and \ncommunity members can help reduce apathy and insecurity among the \nvulnerable in Balochistan. \n   \nRisks and  The  success  of  the  program  is  subject  to  a  number  of  risks  and \nAssumptions  assumptions. Appropriate risk mitigation measures have been integrated \n  into the program design, and are discussed below. \n \nThe  government  has  a  wide  constituency  to  satisfy  and  is  therefore \nvulnerable  to  different  pressures.  The  porous  borders  with  neighboring \ncountries allow rampant smuggling. Law enforcement is handicapped by \nseparate but coexisting rules and enforcement systems in some parts of \nthe province. The vast size and rugged terrain of the province and the \nsparse,  poorly  connected  population  make  administration  all  the  more \ndifficult. BDSSP cannot mitigate all these risks, particularly those related to \ngeopolitics. But it will help mitigate some risks and would link with ongoing \nefforts in this regard under BRMP, DSP, Access to Justice Program, and \nother programs. \n \nThere  is  a  risk  that  vested  interests  might  be  resistant  to  the  new \ntransparent and accountable processes and reluctant to change systems. \nTo  mitigate  such  risks,  high-level  support  and  a  high-level  steering \ncommittee will be important. Risks are expected to be further mitigated \nthrough such BDSSP policy actions as special audits, public availability of \naccounts and expenditures, and public grievance mechanisms. A major \nfocus of BDSSP is improving social sector governance, and establishing \ntransparent and objective decision-making to minimize rent seeking. The \nimplementation of reforms might therefore be delayed or undermined by \nvested interests. BDSSP will counter such risks by building stakeholder \n ", "x         \n \nownership  during  program  design  and  implementation,  establishing \nprogram  oversight  mechanisms  including  the  participation  of  local \ngovernment council committees, and ensuring synergy with other reform \nprograms. \n \nFast-track devolution has brought with it a substantial agenda of political, \nadministrative, and fiscal restructuring; new systems, rules, and guidelines; \nand the need to train administrators and councilors. Local government \nsystems  must  be  fully  operational  and  government  departments  and \nagencies geared to fully support the process. A major concern is the limited \nactual devolution of financial, managerial, and technical responsibilities and \nthe inadequate capacity of local government functionaries. These risks will \nbe mitigated by rationalizing the roles and responsibilities of the provincial \ndepartments  in  the  light  of  their  changed  relationship  with  the  local \ngovernments under BLGO 2001, and building local government capacity \nunder the TA Loan. \n \nPakistan\u2019s  macroeconomic  parameters  have  been  strong  in  the  past \nfew  years  and  policy  reforms  are  beginning  to  show  positive  results. \nHowever, poverty remains unacceptably high and cannot be allowed to \nstay that way. The country is highly vulnerable to external shocks. To \nmitigate  such  risks  as  far  as  possible,  Pakistan  has  put  in  place  a \nconsistent economic management strategy to reduce debt and help ensure \nfiscal  stability.  The  government  of  Balochistan,  with  BRMP  support,  is \ndeveloping its own debt management strategy. \n \n \n \n ",

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) two proposed \nprogram  loans,  (ii)  a  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  loan,  and  (iii)  a  proposed  Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) grant\u2014all to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Balochistan \nDevolved Social Services Program (BDSSP).1 \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n2.  Pakistan\u2019s macroeconomic situation has improved significantly in the last few years. \nBefore the 1990s, external capital flows drove gross domestic product (GDP) growth rates of \n6%, causing major structural imbalances in public finance. The rapid accumulation of debt led to \nserious  fiscal  constraints  in  the  1990s:  average  GDP  growth  declined  to  4.4%  and \nunemployment rose from 4.7% in fiscal year (FY) 1993 to 7.8% in FY2000.2 Since FY2000, \nhowever, the overall economy and fiscal balance have improved, and economic performance \ncontinues to show strength\u2014macroeconomic fundamentals are better than at any time in the \npast decade. In FY2005, GDP growth was 8.4% (compared with 6.4% in FY2004), the highest \nin the last two decades. But the fiscal deficit has also grown to 3.2% of GDP in FY2005 from \n2.3% of GDP the previous year. \n \n3.  In FY2006, GDP growth is likely to be broad-based and is expected to be more than \n7%, while the fiscal deficit will remain below 4%. The medium-term prospects for the Pakistan \neconomy continue to improve, but sustained economic recovery is subject to certain risks. \nThere are early signs of overheating\u2014inflation rose to 9.3% in FY2005. Imports are expanding \nrapidly, from 15.6% in FY2004 to more than 18% in FY2005. The current account went from a \nsurplus of 1.9% of GDP in FY2004 to a deficit of 1.4% of GDP in FY2005. \n \n4.  The  Government  has  embarked  on  a  major  decentralization  effort,  together  with \nnationwide reforms in public financing and management and a poverty reduction strategy. \nStrong economic growth in the last few years and a substantial increase in poverty-related \npublic expenditure over the past 5 years have had a positive impact on poverty. There are \nencouraging trends in the achievement of the expenditure targets set in the Poverty Reduction \nStrategy Paper (PRSP)\u2014expenditures increased to 4.6% of GDP in FY2004 from 3.8% in \nFY2002.  \n \n5.  Between 2001 and 2003, unemployment decreased from 8.3% to 7.7% in Pakistan but \nincreased from 7.8% to 8.2% in Balochistan.3 According to the Labor Force Survey (LFS) \n2003\u20132004, urban unemployment is 9.7% in Pakistan, and 12.5% in Balochistan. The increase \nin unemployment in Balochistan at a time when Pakistan\u2019s economy and employment were \nimproving indicates that Balochistan has not benefited much from the economic growth in other \nparts of Pakistan (Supplementary Appendix A).  \n \n6.  Of the budgeted revenue receipts for FY2005, close to 95% are expected to come from \nfederal government transfers. The provincial tax base is narrow and limited. The government of \nBalochistan has a large stock of high-interest debt, and in FY2004, PRs2.6 billion, or 10.7% of \nits total current expenditure, went to debt servicing.

There is significant opportunity to create additional \nfiscal space by refinancing the CDLs (Appendix 2 and Supplementary Appendix B).4 \nIII.  THE SOCIAL SERVICES SECTORS \n A.  Sector Description and Performance \n1.  Overview \n7.  In Pakistan, Balochistan has the highest percentage of the highly deprived, in both \nincome and human poverty terms: 88% of its people live in highly deprived districts (see \nSupplementary Appendix C).5 Human development indicators in Balochistan are the weakest \namong the four provinces of Pakistan and improvements will need concerted efforts over the \nlong term (Appendix 3). To expedite human development and reduce income poverty, the \ngovernment of Balochistan has formulated the Balochistan Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper \n(BPRSP) (2003),6 whose key pillars are engendering growth, managing scarce water resources, \nreforming governance, improving human development, and addressing vulnerability to shocks.  \n2.  Poverty and Social Development \n8.  Balochistan has a predominantly poor rural population, which is thinly distributed over \nvast and difficult terrain. The province has 44.0% (350,000 square kilometers) of Pakistan\u2019s land \nmass but only 5.0% of the population. Poverty in Balochistan is a consequence of several \nfactors, including geography and low human capital. Inequality, though pervasive (Gini index: \n20), is less than in Pakistan as a whole (Gini index: 27) in 2001. Though poverty in Balochistan \nis more \u201cshared\u201d poverty, income-based inequities in human development must be addressed. \nThe poor are recovering from the devastating drought that plagued the province for the last 5 \nyears.  The  groundwater  is  rapidly  being  depleted.  Only  6%  of  the  land  is  cultivable  and \nproductivity  is  low  because  of  the  arid  conditions.  The  ethnic  diversity  and  predominantly \npatriarchal social structures are a traditional challenge to human development and gender \nequity.  \n \n9.  Addressing human development needs in Balochistan is made more costly and difficult \nby the spatial distribution of household poverty, the basic infrastructure, ethnic diversity, gender \nimbalances, generational distribution of poverty, fiscal framework and fiscal traps (including the \npublic investment needed to reduce poverty, and  the debt overhang), physical geography \n(including  transport  conditions  and  population  densities),  agronomic  conditions,  disease \necology, governance patterns and failure, cultural barriers, and geopolitics. These factors,7 \nwhich are absent in traditional economic analysis,  must be carefully considered when planning \ndevelopment assistance for Balochistan.  \n \n10.  Gender and Development. Balochistan\u2019s social sector indicators underscore the high \ndegree of gender inequality: in primary school, for example, the net primary enrollment rate is \n28% for boys but only 20% for girls. Women\u2019s inferior status is perpetuated by their curtailed \nmobility, discriminatory tribal and cultural practices, women\u2019s limited voice in critical household \ndecisions,  and  political  marginalization.  The  gender  reform  agenda  of  the  government  is \n                                                 \n4  Based on estimates from studies for the Balochistan Resource Management Program. \n5  Jamal, H., A.

Initiatives like the GRAP, Decentralization Support Program (DSP), BRMP, \nand BDSSP aim to give women more access to public sector services and greater participation \nin public sector management and in political and economic activities. \n3.  Devolution to Local Governments \n11.  Centralized  planning  and  management  of  social  services  has  created  indisciplined, \nunionized,  and  absentee  government  providers;  a  lack  of  focus  on  clients\u2019  needs;  central \nbureaucracies overwhelmed by transfers and service litigations; and communities indifferent to \nsocial service delivery. As a result, public social services have become less effective and \nefficient and their quality has declined, even as they have become more inaccessible, especially \nto the poor and people living in remote areas. The Balochistan Local Government Ordinance \n(BLGO)  2001,  as  amended  from  time  to  time,  most  recently  in  June  2005,  provides  an \ninstitutional framework that empowers district governments, tehsil (sub-district administrative \nunit) municipal administrations (TMAs), and union administrations to manage and administer the \neducation,  health,  and  water  supply  and  sanitation  (WSS)  sectors  with  the  help  of  local \ncommunities. The devolution of social service management to local governments presents an \nopportunity  to  improve  service  delivery.  The  transition  from  provincial  to  local  government \ndelivery involves many institutional, capacity, legal, and financial challenges, which must be \naddressed though policy reforms and TA to prepare the provincial line departments and local \ngovernments for their changed roles and responsibilities. The government of Balochistan has \nbeen addressing these transition issues with Asian Development Bank (ADB) support through \nthe DSP and BRMP. Further policy reforms and assistance are needed to consolidate ongoing \nreforms and implement the next phase of reforms, improve the capacity of managers and \nproviders, and encourage the private sector and ordinary citizens to participate in social service \ndelivery (Supplementary Appendix D).  \n4.  Social Sector Financing \n12.  Balochistan has limited room to increase its social sector expenditures partly because of \nits high debt-service burden. Currently, social sector expenditures mostly go to salaries, while \nnon-salary  expenditures  are  well  below  the  global  norms  for  the  efficient  and  effective \nfunctioning  of  the  social  sectors.  BLGO  2001  made  the  district  governments  primarily \nresponsible  for  education,  health,  and  WSS,  among  others.  However,  only  salary-related \nbudgets have been devolved to the local governments; the province has retained most of the \nnon-salary and development expenditures for the devolved social services. Understandably, the \ndevelopment effectiveness of the local governments has therefore been reduced (Appendix 2). \n5.  Millennium Development Goals \n13.  Net primary enrollment rates (goal 2) for both boys (28%) and girls (20%) are very low \nand improving slowly. Gender disparity in school education (goal 3) is decreasing, but is still a \nlong way from the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Substantial investments will have to \nbe made to achieve the MDG related to child health (goal 4). Maternal health indicators (goal 5) \nare low: only 26% of pregnant women have prenatal care, and only 21% are delivered by skilled \nbirth  attendants.  Malaria  and  tuberculosis  are  major  problems,  and  the  human \nimmunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) requires determined \nefforts  to  contain  (goal  6).  Goal  7,  relating  to  access  to  drinking  water  and  sanitation,  is \nachievable but will need significant investments to improve access and infrastructure (Appendix \n4). \n \n ", "4       \n \n6.  Education \n14.  Though  the  government  of  Balochistan  has  assigned  priority  to  female  and  rural \neducation, gender and regional disparities remain, and much more needs to be done to meet \nthe Education for All (EFA) and Education Sector Reform (ESR) targets and the MDGs. The \nliteracy rate for those 10 years and above is 28%, compared with the national average of \n48%.The rural literacy rate (23%) is significantly lower than the urban rate (54%), and literacy \namong rural females (10%) is only one-third of rural males (37%) (Supplementary Appendix E).  \n \n15.  Long walking distances, lack of basic amenities, and teacher absenteeism are some of \nthe main factors, together with poor-quality teaching and learning materials, that are responsible \nfor  low  enrollment.  Income-based  inequities  are  a  leading  cause  of  low  access  to  school \neducation. While the enrollment ratio between boys and girls in Pakistan is 1.5:1, in the lowest \nincome quartile it is 1.9:1, and in the lowest quartile in Balochistan it is 6.3:1. As income falls, \nparents\u2019 willingness and resolve to educate daughters falls faster, more so in Balochistan.8 The \ncontinuation rate from primary to middle school is about 23%, and from middle to high school \nabout 39%. A significant discrepancy in number between primary and middle schools forces \nhigh dropout rates after primary school. \n \n16.  The government school network comprises 11,417 schools, with a reported enrollment \nof  813,763,  including  590  \u201cmosque\u201d  schools  with  20,611  students.  There  are  numerous \nshelterless schools, and even where buildings are available, these are in disrepair and lack \nbasic amenities like drinking water, latrines, and electricity. The shortage of female teachers is \nreflected in the student-teacher ratios: 1:10 in boys\u2019 schools and 1:17 in girls\u2019 schools at the \nprimary level, and 1:16 in boys\u2019 schools and 1:25 in girls\u2019 schools in high school. During a \nsurvey in rural Balochistan, 25% of the schools surveyed were not holding classes because of \nteacher absenteeism. The same survey showed that even in those schools that were holding \nclasses only 85% of the teachers were present.9 The disruption of teaching is acute, as most of \nthe schools are either single- or two-teacher schools.  \n \n17.  In  the  urban  areas,  the  private  sector\u2014both  for-profit  and  not-for-profit  educational \ninstitutions\u2014is supporting the public sector in improving access to education. The Balochistan \nEducation Foundation was established to promote and finance the development of education in \nthe province, but the participation of the private sector in education is generally more limited \nthan in other parts of Pakistan.10 Given the sparse distribution of private institutions in most \ndeprived  parts  of  Balochistan,  and  the  limited  interest  of  the  private  sector  in  providing \neducation to the poor, the public school infrastructure must be strengthened to give better \naccess to the rural poor and girls.11 \n7.  Health \n18.  The National Health Policy 2001 gives priority to primary and secondary health care. The \nInterim  Population  Sector  Perspective  Plan  2012  (2004)  looked  forward  to  reducing  the \npopulation growth rate to 1.9% by 2004. The Balochistan Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper \n(BPRSP) 2003 highlights strategies in line with national population policies. Since the passage \nof BLGO 2001, major public health functions have been devolved to district governments. \n                                                 \n8  World Bank. 1996.

The percentage of \nprovincial expenditures allocated to health increased from 7.6% to 8.7% from 1991 to 1998. \nThere is an acute shortage of female staff at all levels outside Quetta. Mean bed occupancy \nrates have been low: basic health units (19%), tehsil headquarters hospitals (35%), and district \nheadquarters hospitals (34%). However, around 38% of patients use government facilities for \ntheir first consultation in Balochistan, compared with 16% in Punjab.12 \n \n19.  Balochistan province must overcome major challenges to achieve the MDGs related to \ninfant and maternal health. Around 158 out of every 1,000 children born do not reach their fifth \nbirthday (Supplementary Appendix F). Under-5 mortality in rural areas (164 per 1,000 live births) \nis much higher than in urban areas (130 per 1,000 live births). About 4 out of every 10 children \nare underweight for their age, although the National Nutrition Survey of 2001/02 projected a \nslightly  lower  figure  of  35.3%  among  children  6\u201359  months  in  the  province.  Only  26%  of \npregnant women (53% urban and 21% rural) availed themselves of prenatal care services from \ntrained birth attendants. Skilled birth attendants assisted 21% of women (47% urban and 16% \nrural) during delivery. The use of postnatal care by women in the first 40 days after delivery was \nalso found to be very low (20% overall, with urban-rural variation of 44% and 15%, respectively). \nOnly  14%  of  married  women  use  modern  contraceptives  (15%,  if  all  other  contraceptive \nmethods are considered). The fertility rate for the province in 1998, according to the census that \nyear, was 5.4. \n \n20.  HIV/AIDS and Infectious Diseases. Malaria and tuberculosis pose serious threats to \nthe health of the poor in Balochistan. Tuberculosis incidence is 177 per 100,000 population. \nThere is a need to expand and strengthen directly observed therapy (DOTS) to deal effectively \nwith the tuberculosis problem in the province. The annual parasite incidence of 6.56 for malaria \nin  Balochistan  is  almost  30  times  the  parasite  incidence  for  the  whole  country.  Effective \nmeasures to control the malaria vector and treat malaria cases are important to improve health \nand reduce anemia and other morbidities in women and children. The HIV/AIDS epidemic is \nmainly concentrated among injecting drug users in the province. A quick and concerted effort is \nrequired to control the spread of HIV/AIDS. HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis are discussed \nin detail in Appendix 5. \n \n21.  The private health sector comprises mostly private clinics run by a general duty doctor \nand a paramedic/nurse or a less qualified person. Private practice after office hours is common \namong public sector doctors. There are more than 3,500 registered pharmacies, mostly in urban \nareas,  which  sell  drugs  over  the  counter  with  limited  prescribing.  The  Balochistan  Health \nFoundation has, until September 2004, provided financial assistance to 17 projects. \n8.  Water Supply and Sanitation \n22.  Nearly one half of the population of Balochistan relies on unprotected wells, ponds, \ncanals, or streams for their drinking water needs. In rural areas, where the burden of fetching \nwater largely falls on women and girls, only 39% of households have access to improved water \nsources within a 2-kilometer distance or a half-hour walk from their homes.13 Over-extraction of \ngroundwater resulting from both population pressures and electricity subsidies for agricultural \ntube wells (refer to Supplementary Appendix G for details) has led to rapid depletion of the \nwater table. Drinking water is often polluted and distributed without treatment. Furthermore, \n                                                 \n12 World Bank. 1998. Pakistan Towards a Health Sector Strategy. Washington, DC. \n13  Government of Balochistan. 2003. Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey. Quetta, Bureau of Statistics, Government of \nBalochistan.  \n ", "6       \n \ncontamination also occurs in the water distribution network through corrosion and, due to low \nwater  pressure,  cross-contamination  from  nearby  sewers.  Water  quality  is  not  monitored \nregularly at the source or at the consumer end in the province.  \n \n23.  Access to adequate sanitation varies considerably among the districts in the province:  \nin only five districts is sanitation accessible to more than 51% of the population; in nine districts \nadequate sanitation is available to 26\u201350% of the population, and in 13 districts household \nsanitation coverage is only 4\u201325%. Access to sewage disposal infrastructure is largely absent.  \nIn most districts, less than 3% of the population has access to wastewater disposal facilities.  \nBalochistan  has  no  wastewater  treatment  facilities.  In  urban  areas,  household  sewage  is \ndischarged into natural drains (nullahs) and ultimately into low-lying areas of the town. Garbage \nlitters the landscape, particularly in urban areas and along main roads. Apart from Quetta, \nGwadar, and Kila Abdullah towns, solid waste collection, transportation, and disposal coverage \nis less than 3%. Waste material is burned, dumped in open spaces, used for uncontrolled landfill \nand land reclamation, or thrown into drains and watercourses. \n \n24.  BLGO 2001 also turned over responsibility for water supply, sanitation, and solid waste \ncollection to local governments. The public health engineering (PHE) department has been \ndevolved to the district governments, while solid waste management (in both rural and urban \nareas of the tehsil) is now the responsibility of TMAs. The district governments, with funds from \nthe provincial department, are responsible for the operation and maintenance (O&M) of all water \nsupply schemes built before 1992.  \n \n25.  After 1992, the 962 schemes developed by the PHE department were handed over to \nthe  communities  for  O&M.  The  communities  report  difficulties  in  meeting  operation  costs, \nbecause of very high electricity bills and bills with varying tariff structures. In Quetta, WSS is the \nresponsibility  of  the  Quetta  Water  and  Sanitation  Authority,  while  solid  waste  collection, \ntransportation, and disposal are undertaken by the municipal administrations of Chiltan and \nZarghoon towns. No TMA has proper facilities for the collection and sanitary disposal of hospital \nwaste. The water agencies and municipal bodies traditionally charged with managing water \nsupply, wastewater, and solid waste suffer from financial weaknesses that prevent them from \ngenerating  capital  to  rehabilitate,  improve,  and  expand  infrastructure  and  facilities.  Private \nsector operators have developed tube wells on private land, particularly in Quetta, for the \npurpose of selling water to water vendors. The private sector participates in the transportation of \nsolid waste and in recycling schemes, which involve the purchase of materials such as paper, \nglass, and iron produced and segregated by households. Several nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs)  in  Balochistan  are  supporting  the  development  of  small  community-driven  WSS \nschemes. NGOs are also active in promoting hygiene and sanitation and the construction of \nhousehold toilets, both in urban and rural areas. \nB.  Issues, Opportunities, and Lessons \n1.  Issues and Opportunities \n26.  The  government  of  Balochistan  is  committed  to  alleviating  poverty  and  gender \nimbalance in a holistic manner, through such means as public service delivery. The local \ngovernment system put in place by BLGO 2001 offers major opportunities for reforms and a \nlevel of political representation that is closer to and more dependent on public interests. The \nbasis for the devolution of social service delivery is a clearer definition of intergovernmental \nfunctions. Actual delivery responsibility is devolved to local governments with revenue-matching \nexpenditure assignments and associated control over establishment and service delivery outfits. \nThe  province  will  have  key  policy,  financing,  standard-setting,  mentoring/technical,  legality \ncontrol, and evaluation functions. \n ", "  7\n \n27.  It is evident that to make public service delivery more efficient, equitable, effective, and \nsustainable,  serious  problems  in  the  economic,  social,  legal,  and  political  aspects  of \ngovernance,  participation,  and  financing  must  be  addressed.  ADB  and  other  development \npartners support both BPRSP and the strengthening of the financial framework through better \nbudget planning and execution and smoother intergovernmental flows, to make decentralization \nwork. The BRMP provides major policy reforms to strengthen devolution and improve public \nservice  delivery.  The  recently  notified  Balochistan  Performance  Grant  Rules  (BPGR)  2005 \nprovide a flexible mechanism for providing conditional transfers to local governments to make \npro-poor service delivery more responsive to local needs, within the policy priorities of the \nprovince. \n \n28.  In  Balochistan,  the  following  opportunities  can  be  tapped  to  improve  social  service \ndelivery: (i) giving provincial line departments an effective role in policy making and standard \nsetting while leaving the management and control of devolved subjects to local governments; \n(ii) assigning responsibilities to local governments by passing supporting rules to transfer power \nof appointing and transferring staff; approve and sanction development schemes; and enforce \nefficiency and discipline rules; and (iii) restructuring vertical programs and the public sector \ndevelopment program to bring them in line with the mandate of BLGO 2001. ADB\u2019s support for \nBalochistan  is  growing  (Supplementary  Appendix  H)  and  is  significant  given  the  immense \nhuman development challenges in Balochistan and the limited donor presence (Appendix 6). \n \n29.  Through appropriate policy reforms and capacity building, the following issues can be \naddressed more effectively by provincial and local governments: accountability of providers; \ncorruption  and  misconduct;  use  of  staff  resources;  staff  absenteeism;  performance-based \nincentives; female staff deployment; sector strategic frameworks and action plans and sector \nplanning capacity in the local governments; constraints posed by the dispersed population; the \nfailure of the \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d formula in the provision and location of facilities; and the absence \nof priorities or thresholds for various types and levels of service. \n \n30.  Predictable  financing  for  devolved  social  sectors,  including  development  budgets \nconsistent with BLGO 2001 and expenditure assignments from the provincial budget, is critical. \nOther issues related to financial management are: (i) absence of reliable, timely, and complete \ninformation on provincial and district government transactions; (ii) poor financial controls at all \nlevels; (iii) inadequate budgetary and financial discipline; (iv) delays in audits; (v) lack of public \naccess to financial statements; (vi) inadequate expenditure prioritization; and (vii) absence of \nexpenditure yardsticks for the allocation of non-salary expenditures. \n \n31.  The  centralization  of  decision  making  in  the  province  leaves  little  room  for  citizen \nparticipation in government functioning at the local level. There is limited transparency, little \npublic participation at the local level, and no direct accountability to stakeholders since (i) very \nfew documents are available to the public; (ii) there are no reports on the performance of the \nprovincial or local governments; (iii) there are no mechanisms for the redressal of grievances; \nand (iv) the partnerships between government and civil society or the private sector remain \nlimited. \n \n32.  To increase accountability, the BLGO emphasizes the role of the community, citizen \ncommunity boards (CCBs), public-private partnerships, and the private sector in expanding \nsocial services, and provides for citizen oversight in the social sectors. This links well with the \nrealities on the ground, where communities and the private sector (including NGOs) have been \nassisting in the expansion of social sector service delivery. However, it does require a change of \nmind-set. Devolution provides a unique opportunity to make this happen.  \n ", "8       \n \n2.  Lessons Identified \n33.  Important  lessons  learned  from  past  donor  support  and  ADB\u2019s  own  experiences  in \ngeneral and devolved social services programs in Sindh and Punjab have been incorporated in \nthe program design. The experiences of the Social Action Program (SAP) and the lessons \nlearned are given in Supplementary Appendix I. The decade-long SAP did not lead to tangible \nimprovements in the delivery of basic social services. The breakdown of governance, where the \npoor were marginalized by limited or no access to public facilities, characterized the SAP period. \nGovernment facilities remained weak, with many facilities cited not functioning because of lack \nof staff, especially teachers and health workers, despite SAP investments.  \n \n34.  The  DSSPs  of  Sindh,  Punjab,  and  Balochistan  are  compared  in  Supplementary \nAppendix J. Integration with other ADB programs, including DSP and BRMP, is expected to \ngenerate  synergy  for  the  success  of  BDSSP  by  ensuring  better  risk  mitigation  measures, \nbuilding on the enabling environment created by these programs, and prioritizing issues for \npolicy  dialogue.  BRMP  supported  the  notification  of  BPGR  2005,  which  will  facilitate  the \nimplementation of performance grants in BDSSP. Advance actions to ensure timely TA have \nemerged as critical to program success. For policy dialogue and sustained reforms, a robust \nframework  for  devolved  social  services  was  deemed  necessary.  Clear  policies  arrived  at \nthrough rigorous policy dialogue were considered essential, as were clear agreements with \nspecific, achievable, measurable, realistic, and timely policy action indicators. It was also felt \nthat the strong incentives for the province had to be part of the program design.  \n \n35.  There is an urgent need to fix social service delivery by also addressing the underlying \ngovernance issues. The traditional project emphasis on specific project components has limited \nimpact on governance and institutional issues. Ongoing investments in public social services \nmust  be  improved  through  governance  and  institutional  reforms\u2014mainly  through  policy \nreforms\u2014while increasing the scope for effective and well-targeted investments in public social \nsectors. The BDSSP design will include both policy reforms and additional investments in \ndevolved social services through performance grants; the investments must be targeted and \ncapable of being tracked and measured. However, reform is a long-term endeavor, and will \nrequire long-term support from external donor partners, including ADB. The policy and program \nresponses must build on past successful approaches, adapted to a devolved setting. Targeting \nsocial sector investments to reach the poor, in areas of maximum impact on poverty reduction, \nis critical. BDSSP proposes social sector investments through performance grants in areas with \nthe  highest  impact  on  poverty  reduction,  and  includes  public  expenditure  tracking  and \nquantitative service delivery surveys to assess the quality of targeting and the development \nimpact of the program. The problem-tree analysis and options are discussed in Supplementary \nAppendix K. \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \nA.  Objectives and Scope \n36.  The goal of BDSSP is to expedite Balochistan\u2019s progress toward the MDGs and the \nBPRSP goals14 in education, health, and WSS. The objectives of BDSSP are to (i) improve \naccess to affordable, efficient, effective, and good-quality education, health, and WSS in the \n                                                 \n14 The human development goals set in Balochistan Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper are: (i) better access to \neducation, with emphasis on technical and vocational education and training, especially of girls; (ii) provision of \nsafe drinking water; (iii) better health and nutrition, particularly for vulnerable groups (women and children); (iv) \nhousing, sanitation, and solid waste management; and (v) use of information technology to disseminate the \nimprovements in health, nutrition, sanitation, and education. \n ", "  9\npublic and private sectors; (ii) decrease inequities based on income, gender, ethnicity, and \ngeography in the education, health, and WSS sectors; and (iii) strengthen local governments, \nthe  private  sector,  and  communities  to  improve  social  service  delivery.  These  goals  and \nobjectives will be achieved by enhancing the capacity of the provincial and local governments to \nfulfill their realigned roles and responsibilities in social service delivery. The policy reforms and \nTA would lead to improved governance and social service management. The performance \ngrants to local governments would improve access to social services, particularly for the female \nand poor, reducing gender- and income-based disparities and promoting social service equity, \naffordability, efficiency, and sustainability. The program design and monitoring framework is \ngiven in Appendix 1. \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions \n1.  Policy Framework \n37.  The  conceptual  framework  for  the  policy  reforms  is  adapted  from  the  framework \nproposed in ADB, World Bank, and Department for International Development (DFID) report on \ndevolution in Pakistan.15 The role of the private sector in the delivery of social services\u2014both \npublicly and privately financed\u2014has been increasing in importance (Supplementary Appendix \nL); hence, strengthening the role of the private sector in a devolved setting is included in the \nframework as a policy reform outcome. Figure 1 summarizes the conceptual framework and the \nfour major policy reform areas and outcomes. The government of Balochistan has expressed its \ncommitment to the reforms and to increased social sector spending (Appendix 7). The policy \nreform  outcomes,  policy  reform  areas,  and  agreed  actions  are  given  in  the  policy  matrix \n(Appendix 8). The four major policy reform areas are described below. \n2.  Policy Reform Outcomes \n38.  The  program  has  four  principal  policy  areas:  (i)  provincial  efficiency  incentives; \n(ii) managerial power; (iii) citizens\u2019 voice and empowerment; and (iv) private sector engagement. \n \n39.  Provincial Efficiency Incentives. These incentives strengthen the relationship between \nprovincial and local governments so that social service delivery is improved through efficiency \ngains including budgetary certainties, greater autonomy in budget preparation, and incentives \nfor improved fiscal management by local governments.  \n \n40.  Managerial  Power.  This  aims  to  strengthen  the  relationship  between  the  district \ngovernments and the providers of social services. The local governments engage with service \ndelivery  providers  through  managerial  power,  which  reflects  their  ability  to  require  service \nproviders to follow particular standards of behavior and service. The reforms in this area would \ndeal, among others, with posting and transfers, authority of district governments over senior \nstaff, external oversight, and adequate deployment of staff.  \n \n41.  Citizens\u2019 Voice and Empowerment. The reforms under this heading will strengthen the \nrelationship between citizens and the provincial and district policy makers, and will offer citizens \na channel through which their demands for better social services can be heard. The reforms will \n                                                 \n15 The framework to make social services reach the poor was first proposed in the World Bank. 2004.

The empowerment of citizens, \nwhich strengthens the relationship between the clients and the providers of the services, will \nprovide  potential  service  recipients  with  direct  means  to  influence  how  the  services  are \nprovided. The reforms in this area will include citizen dispute resolution and grievance redressal \nmechanisms, and community management of facilities. \n \n42.  Private Sector Engagement. Sector NGOs and voluntary groups are making valuable \ncontributions in education and health services, including women\u2019s literacy and sensitive areas \nlike sexual and reproductive health and the control of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and \nHIV/AIDS, but their overall contribution is small because of capacity constraints. The private \nsector is growing rapidly in the urban areas and is the leading provider in the health sector. The \ngovernment has been exploring the possibility of public-private partnerships (PPPs) sponsoring \nNGOs proposed by local governments to support communities and improve social service \ndelivery.  At  the  same  time,  the  private  sector  also  needs  support  to  provide  good-quality \nservices more effectively (Supplementary Appendix L). The policy reforms related to PPP and \nprivate sector participation (PSP) are closely linked to the achievement of the social sector \ntargets set in the BPRSP and strengthened implementation of local government legislation.  \n \n ", " 11\n3.  Policy Reform Areas \na.  Provincial Efficiency Incentives \n43.  Policy Reform Area (PRA) 1.1: Budget Certainty for Social Sectors. One of the \nobjectives of BDSSP is to improve the availability and certainty of funding to local governments \nfor  their  social  sectors.  The  performance  grant  mechanism  under  BPGR  2005  is  to  be \noperationalized.  A  TA  loan  will  support  a  study  on  the  integration  of  the  present  vertical \nprograms in social sectors that are funded or supported by the federal Government, to allow the \ntransfer of funds to local governments. The study is expected to lead to agreed actions and, if \nnecessary, those will be taken up with the Government of Pakistan. Further, the scope of \nperformance grants to local governments would be enlarged to include special programs, block \ngrants, and umbrella projects/programs in the devolved social sectors. \n \n44.  PRA  1.2:  Autonomy  in  Budget  Preparation  and  Administrative  Actions.  \nThe mandate of the local governments to govern and to plan, prioritize, implement, manage, \nand deliver devolved social services requires them to be thus empowered under the rules and \nprocedures.  Local  governments  must  have  powers  to  approve  and  sanction  schemes.  In \naddition, the responsibilities of provincial departments for the devolved social sectors would \nneed to be redesigned to conform to their new role under the provincial-local relationships \nnecessitated by BLGO 2001. BDSSP, through a TA loan, will support a study on the role and \nresponsibilities of the provincial departments (education, health, public health engineering), \nconsidering the need to strengthen their policy formulation, standard setting, and technical \nsupport  and  capacity  building  of  local  governments,  and  will  assist  in  implementing  its \nrecommendations. \n \n45.  PRA 1.3: Improved Quality of Social Services. This is an area of central concern, and \nBDSSP  would  support  measures  taken  by  the  government  of  Balochistan  to  provide  and \nstrengthen the framework for quality improvements at the local level. These measures would \ninclude (i) sector strategy and action plans, (ii) expenditure allocation yardsticks, (iii) sector-\nspecific actions such as introducing a package of essential services in the health sector, and \n(iv) institutional support to build the capacity of sector managers and service providers by \nstrengthening the planning cell in the provincial health department, creating a provincial corps of \ntrainers  to  prepare  master  trainers  at  the  district  level  for  in-service  teacher  training, \nstrengthening the Institute of Public Health in Quetta and the paramedical and nursing training \nschools outside Quetta, and other means. \nb.  Managerial Power \n46.  PRA  2.1:  Authority  to  District  Governments  to  Appoint  and  Transfer  Staff. \nPersonnel management is controlled by the government of Balochistan, which continues to \nexercise  administrative  powers  over  appointments  and  transfers.  District  government  staff \ncontinues to have direct links with their administrative departments at the cost of horizontal \nlinkages, coordination, harmony, discipline, and accountability. This situation seriously hampers \nthe ability and performance of local governments. BDSSP policy reform therefore involves \ngiving local governments authority to appoint and transfer staff and to enforce efficiency and \ndiscipline rules in the education, health, and public health engineering departments. \n \n47.  PRA 2.2: Adequate Deployment of Staff. To ensure adequately staffed facilities and to \nprovide greater accountability at the community level, BDSSP would support the development of \na system of contract appointments for specific facilities in the education and health sectors. The \nappointments, which may involve hiring retired government servants on contract, cannot be \nregularized. \n ", "12      \n \n \n48.  PRA  2.3:  Improved  Capacities  of  District  Managers  and  Service  Providers.  \nManagement support systems, such as database and management information systems (MIS), \nwill be strengthened in the education and health sectors, particularly at the local government \nlevel, and will be developed for the WSS sector. An ongoing health MIS initiative will be \nassessed to identify gaps and areas for further support. BDSSP will provide TA for the required \nsystems strengthening. Further, the BDSSP TA will support the development of a system of \nperformance-linked incentives for sector managers and service delivery staff, and performance \ngrants will fund pilot implementation.  \n \n49.  Along with the strengthening of management support through the timely availability of \nimproved data, sector managers at the district level will become better able to prepare medium-\nterm and annual work programs and budgets, and undertake financial management monitoring, \nreporting, and audit. BDSSP will provide TA to develop training courses and to conduct training \nat the district level. The quality of social services depends on the capacity of the front-end \nservice  providers,  especially  in  the  case  of  schoolteachers  and  primary  health  care  staff. \nBDSSP will support the training of master trainers at district headquarters by the provincial \ncorps of trainers developed under the TA. These master trainers will provide in-service training \nat various locations within the district to schoolteachers, high-school head teachers in school \nmanagement, and school supervisors. In the health sector, in-service training according to the \ntraining plan developed under the TA will be supported at the district level. \nc.  Citizens\u2019 Voice and Empowerment \n50.  PRA  3.1:  Grievance  Redressal  Mechanisms.  BDSSP  will  provide  TA  support  to \ndevelop and institute grievance redressal mechanisms in the provincial and local governments, \nparticularly  at  the  service  delivery  level.  Support  will  be  provided  to  operationalize  the \nmechanisms  envisaged  under  BLGO  2001,  including  complaint  cells.  The  TA  will  help \nstrengthen local government monitoring committees. \n \n51.  PRA  3.2:  Community  Management  of  Facilities.  The  creation  of  CCBs  to  foster \ncommunity participation in local government and service delivery are envisaged in BLGO 2001, \nand local governments are obliged to provide 25% of their development funds to support the \nCCBs.  BDSSP  will  establish  linkages  with  programs  supporting  the  promotion  and \nstrengthening of CCBs. It will provide a TA loan for the drafting of a communication strategy to \npromote  and  strengthen  community  involvement  in  the  management  of  facilities,  and  will \nsupport the implementation of the strategy. In the education sector, parent-teacher school \nmanagement committees (PTSMCs) have been formed in many schools, and their formation \nand  strengthening  is  being  promoted  under  the  ongoing  Environmental  Sector  Reform \nAssistance (ESRA) program funded by the United States Agency for International Development \n(USAID).  BDSSP  will  develop  linkages  in  the  districts  where  the  ESRA  program  is  being \nimplemented, and support the process in all other districts where the program is not being \nimplemented. BDSSP will develop and introduce hospital management boards in district and 50-\nbed hospitals on a pilot basis and will later expand this support to include all district and 50-bed \nhospitals. \n \n52.  PRA  3.3:  Civil  Society  Monitoring  of  Social  Service  Delivery,  and  Citizen \nOversight. Citizens\u2019 voice and community empowerment are important features of the local \ngovernment system under BLGO 2001, particularly in the delivery of social services. However, \ncitizens\u2019 monitoring of elected public representatives, as provided under BLGO 2001, is not yet \nwell established. BDSSP will therefore facilitate and support the operationalization of citizen \noversight and monitoring programs. First, the BDSSP TA will prepare a program of civil society \n ", " 13\nmonitoring,  look  at  the  various  mechanisms  for  local  government  monitoring  and  citizen \noversight, and implement a system of citizen report cards on a pilot basis in the city district of \nQuetta. The TA will, in addition, support the provincial finance department in introducing public \nexpenditure tracking surveys, and the provincial bureau of statistics in introducing quantitative \nservice delivery surveys and validating the results. The provincial and district governments will \nbe required to make available to the public all reports on the surveys and the third-party \nassessment and validation. \nd.  Private Sector Engagement \n53.  PRA 4.1: Private Sector Participation. BDSSP will provide support under the TA loan \nfor a comprehensive review of policy options for PPP and PSP, and prepare a strategy and plan \nfor the consideration and approval of the government of Balochistan. The TA will examine \nalternative options for the delivery of health services in sparsely populated areas and implement \nselected options on a pilot basis. In the education sector, the TA will support the development of \nan  action  plan  for  engaging  the  private  sector  in  the  development  of  innovative  teaching \nmaterials.  \n \n54.  PRA 4.2: Self-Regulation by the Private Sector. To address the issue of the quality of \nprivate sector services, TA support will be made available for the development of a strategy for \nself-regulation by the private sector in education and health, and it\u2019s the implementation of the \nstrategy  after  it  is  approved.  BDSSP,  through  performance  grants,  will  support  the \nimplementation by the local governments of the approved strategy and plan for PSP and PPP \nprepared  under  the  TA.  Performance  grants  will  also  be  provided  to  support  the  wider \nimplementation of successful initiatives implemented on a pilot basis under the TA. \n4.  Performance Grants \n55.  Performance  grants  to  eligible  district  governments  and  TMAs  will  be  allocated \naccording to the agreed formula under the provincial finance commission (PFC) award for the \ndistribution  of  resources  between  districts  and  eligible  TMAs.  The  administration  of  the \nperformance grants will follow the implementation arrangements under BPGR 2005, as already \nagreed under BRMP. The performance grants will support district governments and eligible \nTMAs in accelerating progress toward the MDGs in education, health, and WSS, within the \nbroad policy reform framework agreed with the government of Balochistan. The performance \ngrants will be funded from two sources: a $65 million ADF loan and a $5 million ADF grant. \nThese grants will be restricted to the education, health, and water supply and sanitation sectors. \nThe district governments and the TMAs will have flexibility to allocate funds from the $65 million \nADF loan among these three sectors according to local needs as long as each sector receives \nat least 20% of the allocations. This will enable the local governments to adopt more effective, \ndemand-driven, and participatory planning to identify gaps and rationalize and develop services \nwith full ownership of the interventions decided by them. However, to ensure balanced progress \nin an accelerated manner toward the MDGs and to enable implementation of the policy reforms, \ncomponents targeting priority investments in education, health, and WSS within the policy \nreform framework have been defined (Appendix 9). A $5 million ADF grant for HIV/AIDS and \ninfectious diseases will support a specific sub-component of the health sector (sub-component \n07B in Appendix 9) to prevent HIV/AIDS and to prevent and treat malaria, tuberculosis, and \nother infectious diseases.  \nC.  Important Features \n56.  BDSSP is the first ADB-supported program loan for the social sectors in Balochistan. \nGiven past experiences, the importance of supporting governance reforms in the social sectors \ncannot  be  underestimated.  This  aspect  assumes  greater  significance  in  the  context  of \n ", "14      \n \ndevolution and the local government structures introduced under BLGO 2001. BDSSP can \ntherefore be seen as primarily a governance program for the devolved social sectors that aims \nto build local government responsibility, accountability, and capacity while at the same time \nimproving  intergovernmental  frameworks  to  enable  local  governments  to  exercise  their \nmandates under BLGO 2001. Thus, local governments would be able to effectively plan and \nefficiently implement and manage social services according to their own needs and priorities. \n \n57.  BDSSP  can  be  seen  as  phase  three  of  ongoing  support  to  the  government  of \nBalochistan.  The  DSP,  in  the  first  phase,  provided  support  for  the  strengthening  of  local \ngovernments, and laid out the institutional context. BRMP, in the second phase, supported and \nstrengthened resource management, and initiated the strengthening of social sector delivery. \nBDSSP will continue the reforms of DSP and BRMP, and create synergistic linkages with the \nearlier  reforms.  BDSSP  policy  reforms  have  been  designed  through  an  iterative  process \ninvolving the provincial government, local governments, civil society, service providers, and \nclients.  The  performance  grants  were  designed  with  the  full  participation  of  the  local \ngovernments at all levels: district, tehsil, and unions. Participatory meetings at the district and \nTMA levels were attended by elected representatives, sector managers of the education, health, \nand WSS sectors, and front-end service providers. Further dialogues were held at the provincial \nlevel  with  the  participation  of  provincial  officials,  civil  society,  sector  NGOs,  and  local \ngovernment functionaries.  \n \n58.  BDSSP has special provisions for promoting gender equity and the participation of the \npoor,  the  vulnerable  and  marginalized  groups.  Particular  attention  has  been  focused  on \nimproving access to education for girls and to providing and expanding reproductive health \nfacilities. The expansion of the pool of female teachers, female health service providers (LHVs, \ncommunity midwives, paramedics) supported by the program is an integral part of the design \nstrategy. Further, the improvement of water supply and the focus on sanitation at the household \nand community level will be of benefit to women by reducing the drudgery associated with water \ncollection and maintaining hygiene. BDSSP has built-in synergies in its TA component and also \nprovides for linkages with ongoing initiatives aimed at supporting devolution and the local \ngovernment system.  \n \nD.  ADF IX Grant for HIV/AIDS and Infectious Diseases Control \n59.  Combating high morbidity and mortality due to malaria and tuberculosis, preventing the \nspread of HIV/AIDS in high-risk groups, and raising general awareness of HIV/AIDS among the \nlargely  illiterate  population  of  Balochistan  will  be  challenging  and  resource-intensive.  The \nvarious aspects of the challenge are described in Appendix 5, while the serious resource \nconstraints that hamper the measures against HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases are given \nin  Appendix  2.  The  $5  million  HIV/AIDS  and  infectious  diseases  grant  from  ADB\u2019s  ADF \nresources will finance specific components of health sector performance grants that will have a \nhigh impact on the prevention of HIV/AIDS, and on the prevention and treatment of malaria and \ntuberculosis.  As  described  in  Appendix  9,  this  grant  will  finance  specific  components  to \n(i) increase awareness  of  HIV/AIDS  and  measures  to  control  its  spread;  (ii)  improve  case \ndetection of tuberculosis and increase access to treatment, mainly through directly observed \ntherapy;  (iii)  control  malaria  vectors,  and  detect  and  treat  malaria  cases;  and  (iv)  control \nchildhood infectious diseases by increasing access to the expanded program on immunization. \nThe  grant  outputs  and  outcomes  will  be  carefully  monitored  through  the  routine  reporting \nmechanisms  of  the  program  loan  and  through  public  expenditure  tracking  surveys  and \nquantitative service delivery surveys. \n ", " 15\nE.  Financing Plan \n60.  In support of the program, the Government of Pakistan has requested a program loan of \n$65 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s special fund resources (ADF), an ADF grant of $5 million, and \na  program  loan  of  $130  million  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR) \n(Table 1). The loans will support the policy reforms described in the development policy letter \nand policy matrix. The cost of adjustment is estimated at $261 million equivalent to include \nsupport for provincial efficiency incentives, the strengthening of managerial powers in the district \ngovernments,  the  promotion  of  citizens\u2019  voice  and  empowerment,  and  private  sector \nparticipation and public-private partnership  (Appendix 2). The high-interest debt refinancing \nfrom ADB\u2019s OCR will create fiscal space, and make available additional sustainable social \nsector financing.  \n \nTable 1: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n  Source  Purpose  Amount \nA.  OCR Loan  To meet program adjustments  130.0 \nB.  ADF Program Loan  To finance performance grants    65.0 \nC.  ADF TA Loan  To support program implementation and others      5.0 \nD.  ADF Grant  To finance the control of HIV/AIDS and other      5.0 \ninfectious diseases  \nTotal          205.0 \nADF = Asian Development Fund, HIV/AIDS = human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency \nsyndrome, OCR = ordinary capital resources, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n61.  The ADF program loan of $65 million will have a term of 24 years, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years; an interest rate of 1% per year during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter; \nand other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Financing and Program Agreements. The \nOCR program loan of $130 million will have a term of 15 years, including a grace period of  \n3 years; an interest rate to be determined according to ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)\u2013based lending facility (LBL), including a commitment charge of 0.75% per year; and \nother  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Program  Agreements.  The \nGovernment of Pakistan has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under \nADB\u2019s LBL facility on these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that it made these \nchoices independently and without relying on any communication or advice from ADB. The \nGovernment of Pakistan will transfer the loan to the government of Balochistan on the same \nterms and conditions, but will bear the foreign currency risk.  \n \n62.  The loans are in support of policy reforms that address long-standing issues in the social \nsector  and  propose  major  sustainable  adjustments  in  the  organization  of  devolved  social \nservices to improve the impact of the services and the participation of the poor. The reforms are \ncritically  linked  to  and  complement  the  agreed  reforms  that  are  being  implemented  under \nBRMP. The policy loans are justified by the content and expected impact of the policy reforms \nand the associated adjustment costs.  \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Program Management \n63.  The planning and development department (P&DD) of Balochistan will be the Executing \nAgency (EA) of the program. The organization structure for program implementation is given in \nAppendix 10 and will consist of: (i) program specific mechanisms, (ii) provincial arrangements, \n ", "16      \n \nand (iii) arrangements at the district, TMA, and community levels. A key challenge will be to \nintegrate the performance reviews and management decisions of the steering and management \nbodies for DSP, BRMP, and other ADB-supported programs/projects in Balochistan, whose \nmandates and memberships overlap with those of the BDSSP, and thus gain efficiencies in \nimplementation. \na.  Program-Specific Mechanisms \n64.  Program Steering Committee (PSC). The PSC will (i) give policy guidance to the \nprogram;  (ii)  supervise  program  activities;  (iii)  approve  the  annual  work  plan  for  the  TA \ncomponent and its budget; (iv) monitor the performance of the provincial program office (PPO), \nthe program units (PUs), and the international and domestic consultants; and (v) ensure BDSSP \ncoordination with DSP, BRMP, and other programs and projects. The PSC will be chaired by the \nadditional chief secretary (development), with the secretary of finance as alternate chair, and \nwill have the following as members: the chief economist, the secretaries of education, health, \npublic health engineering, services and general administration, and local government, and the \nBDSSP coordinator (PSC secretary). Program managers from DSP and BRMP will join the PSC \nas observers.  \n \n65.  Provincial Program Office (PPO). The PPO will (i) plan, coordinate, facilitate, and \nmonitor BDSSP implementation; (ii) coordinate activities, particularly capacity building, with \nDSP, BRMP, and other programs; (iii) interact, communicate, and coordinate policy reforms with \nprovincial departments, and the implementation of BDSSP performance grants with the finance \ndepartment (and, where required, the PFC); (iv) institute appropriate monitoring mechanisms \nthrough the bureau of statistics, finance department (public expenditure tracking surveys and \nreporting from local governments), and third-party validation; (v) prepare and publish as public \ndocuments  reports  documenting,  analyzing,  and  reviewing  BDSSP  progress  and  results; \n(vi) manage contracts awarded at the provincial level; and (vii) liaise with district governments, \nselected TMAs, and provincial departments through their PUs in the capacity-building activities \nunder BDSSP.  \n \n66.  The provincial program office will comprise provincial government (counterpart) staff \nposted for the duration of the program and BDSSP-contracted staff recruited under the TA loan. \nThe government (counterpart) staff will comprise a full-time program coordinator (basic pay \nscale [BPS] 19 or 20), who will be assisted by a program officer (BPS 17 or 18), two full-time \nprogram assistants (at least BPS 15), and other supporting staff as required. The BDSSP-\ncontracted  staff  will  comprise:  (i)  a  senior  program  officer,  (ii)  a  reporting  officer,  (iii)  a \ncoordination assistant, (iv) two database operators, (v) a finance officer, and (vi) an accounts \nassistant.  Appendix  10  shows  the  coordination  and  linkages  with  PSC,  PUs,  and  district \ncommittees.  \n \n67.  The government (counterpart) staff will be part of the government contribution for the TA \nloan  as  approved  in  the  government  project  document  (PC  II),  which  provides  for  their \nallowances, travel, and per diem. The government will also provide office accommodation and \nprocure a vehicle for the program. BDSSP contract staff will be financed under the TA loan. In \naddition, the capital cost of equipment and furniture, and operating costs (supplies, utilities, \ncommunication, and occasional vehicle rental, where necessary), will be financed under the TA \nloan. International and domestic consultants will be recruited to support the PPO.  \n \n68.  District and TMA Program Committee. A district program committee (DPC) to be \nformed in each district government will oversee the implementation of (i) the policy reforms \n ", " 17\nunder BDSSP insofar as they relate to the district governments, (ii) the TA support, and (iii) the \nperformance grants under BDSSP. The committee will meet at least once a month (or more \noften if needed) to ensure full compliance with (i) the grant procedures specified in BPGR 2005, \n(ii) the instructions of the provincial finance department under the rules issued from time to time, \n(iii) the specific conditions for the grants, and (iv) the terms of the partnership agreement with \nthe provincial government. The DPC will be headed by the district nazim, with the district \ncoordination officer as the alternate chair, and will have as members the executive district \nofficers  (EDOs)  of  the  social  sector  group  of  offices  (education,  health,  public  health \nengineering) and the EDO for finance and planning as secretary. It will fulfill its mandate through \nthe PU setup in the office of the EDO for finance and planning. TMA Program Committee will be \nestablished within 2 weeks of the date a TMA has been declared eligible for the performance \ngrant. The TMA program committee will be headed by the tehsil nazim with the tehsil municipal \nofficer as the alternate chair and the tehsil (infrastructure and services) as member-secretary. \nThe committee will oversee all matters in connection with the implementation of (i) the policy \nreform under the Program in as far as related to the TMA, and (ii) the performance grants.  \n \n69.  Program Units (PUs) will be set up in (i) the finance department, (ii) the bureau of \nstatistics, (iii) the planning and finance office in each of the 28 districts16 and (iv) TMAs selected \nto receive BDSSP grants. The PUs will comprise government (counterpart) staff posted for the \nduration of the program and BDSSP contracted staff recruited under the TA loan. The PU in the \nfinance department will be headed by the additional secretary of the department, who will be \nassisted by a program officer, a program assistant, and supporting staff as required. In the \nbureau of statistics the PU will be headed by the bureau director, who will be assisted by a \nprogram officer and an accounts assistant. In both the finance department and bureau of \nstatistics PUs, the program officer and assistants will be financed under the TA loan.  \n \n70.  In each district government the PU will be headed by the EDO for finance and planning, \nwho will be assisted by a program assistant, an office support worker, and a driver. Under the \ndirection and with the approval of the district program committee, the district PU head will \nmaintain  contacts  and  links  with  the  provincial  program  office  as  necessary  for  the \nimplementation of the policy reforms (insofar as they relate to the district government) and the \nimplementation of the TA. The provincial finance department will prescribe the procedures to be \nfollowed by the TMAs selected for BDSSP performance grants. The TMA PU will be headed by \ntehsil municipal officer and assisted by a program officer. The TMA PU will implement the \neligible activities under the performance grants in their respective tehsils.  \n \n71.  Funding and logistical support from the TA loan will be provided to the program units. TA \nand capacity building will be provided by international and domestic consultants, and contract \nstaff recruited under the TA loan. The functions of PUs are described in Appendix 10 (Table \nA10.1). \n2.  Implementation Period \n72.  The program support and policy reforms will be implemented over 3 years, and will be \ncompleted by 30 June 2009. The performance grant support from counterpart funds generated \nout of the program loan and the grant will be implemented over a period of 4 years, until June \n2010. \n                                                 \n16 The 28th district was announced in 2005. All previous references prior to 2005 refer to only 27 districts. \n ", "18      \n \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement  \n73.  The  program  loans  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  standard  procedures  for  procurement  and \ndisbursement. The loan proceeds will finance the full foreign exchange cost, excluding local \nduties and taxes, of eligible items procured from ADB member countries, which must have \nproduced the items, excluding listed ineligible items (Appendix 11) and imports financed by \nother  multilateral  and  bilateral  sources.  All  procurements  under  the  program  loan  will  be \nundertaken  through  normal  commercial  practices  for  the  private  sector  or  the  federal \nGovernment\u2019s prescribed procurement procedures acceptable to ADB, while taking economy \nand efficiency into account. Program loan and grant disbursements will be made in line with \nADB\u2019s simplified disbursement procedures and audit requirements.17 To withdraw the loan and \ngrant proceeds, the Government of Pakistan must certify that the value of eligible imports \nexceeds the amount of ADB\u2019s projected disbursements under the program loans in a given \nperiod. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy \nof the certification from the government.  \n \n4.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n74.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998) was explained to and discussed with the Government \nof Pakistan, government of Balochistan and the Planning and Development Department (the \nexecuting agency). Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations \nand the bidding documents for the Program. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n5.  Counterpart Funds and Tranches \n75.  The counterpart funds generated from the ADF program loan and grant will be used to \nfinance  local  government  expenditures  in  education,  health  care,  and  WSS  through \nperformance grants until June 2010. The performance grants will be implemented according to \nBPGR 2005. The $65 million ADF program loan and the $5 million ADF grant will each be \nreleased in two tranches. The first tranche ($22.5 million of the ADF program loan and $2.5 \nmillion of the ADF grant) is expected to be released by July 2006 upon fulfillment of the first-\ntranche policy actions. The second tranche ($42.5 million of the ADF program loan and $2.5 \nmillion of the ADF grant) is expected to be released by July 2008 upon fulfillment of the second-\ntranche policy actions. The counterpart funds generated from the entire OCR loan will be used \nto restructure the high-interest debt of the government of Balochistan, and the fiscal space thus \ncreated will provide current budget support in devolved social sectors and will be transferred to \nthe local governments under the PFC award. Like the ADF program loan and ADF grant, the \nOCR loan will be released in two tranches, contingent on the fulfillment of policy actions: $110 \nmillion once the first-tranche policy actions are fulfilled, and $20 million upon fulfillment of the \nsecond-tranche policy actions. \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n76.  The government of Balochistan must open an account with the State Bank of Pakistan to \nreceive all loan proceeds. The account must be established, operated, and managed to ADB\u2019s \n                                                 \n17 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements of Program Loans. Manila. \n ", " 19\nsatisfaction.  The  local  governments  receiving  BDSSP  performance  grants  will  maintain \naccounting,  reporting,  and  auditing  procedures  as  prescribed  in  BPGR  2005.  Among  the \nreporting requirements will be an annual report from PFC on the performance grants.  \n7.  Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n77.  To  measure  progress  and  assess  compliance  with  targets,  the  government  of \nBalochistan and ADB have agreed to certain specific actions indicated in the policy matrix, loan \nagreements,  and  the  program  administration  memorandum.  ADB  and  the  government  will \nmaintain  a  continuing  dialogue  throughout  program  implementation.  To  monitor  BDSSP \nimplementation, the government will prepare quarterly progress reports and an annual report on \nprogram implementation and submit these reports to ADB. The quarterly and annual progress \nreports will track the implementation of policy reforms, progress on the grant for the control of \nHIV/AIDS and infectious diseases, the TA under the program, performance grant utilization by \nthe local governments, and general improvements in administrative and financial parameters \nincluding social sector budget allocations and utilization, and staff recruitment, vacancies, and \nfrequency  of  transfers.  Attached  to  the  annual  report  will  be  the  PFC\u2019s  annual  report  on \nperformance grants.  \n \n78.  The  monitoring  and  reporting  on  the  performance  grants  will  follow  the  procedures \nprescribed in BPGR 2005. The government of Balochistan will implement, with TA loan support, \nprovincial expenditure tracking surveys and quantitative service delivery surveys. Third-party \nassessment and validation of the surveys will be made by contracted NGOs. The surveys and \nthird-party assessments will assist in monitoring and evaluating the program outcomes and \nimpact. \n8.  Program Review \n79.  The government of Balochistan, acting through the PPO, will prepare necessary reports \nto  document,  analyze,  and  review  BDSSP  progress  and  results.  The  reports  will  include \nquarterly progress reports and annual reports. The quarterly reports will be submitted within 6 \nweeks of the end of each quarter. The annual report will be submitted within 3 months of the \nend of each year. The government will also submit an inception report within 2 months of loan \neffectiveness,  and  a  program  completion  report  within  3  months  of  the  completion  of  the \nProgram.  \n \n80.  ADB  will  conduct  at  least  on  a  semi-annual  basis  review  missions  jointly  with  the \ngovernment of Balochistan to evaluate compliance with the conditions and advise on actions \nrequired to keep program implementation on course. Among others, the joint review missions \nwill review BDSSP coordination and collaboration with other ongoing reform programs including \nDSP  and  BRMP.  To  encourage  a  policy  dialogue  approach  to  the  review  process,  the \ngovernment of Balochistan, local governments, and ADB will also conduct a joint annual review \nof the program. The government of Balochistan and ADB will also conduct a comprehensive \nmidterm review mission in the second year of program implementation to evaluate progress on \npolicy reforms and the investments under BDSSP performance grants. \n \nV.  PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT \n81.  Objectives. The TA aims to (i) support sector work on specific policy reforms and \nimprove  sector  performance;  (ii)  strengthen  sector  planning,  management,  and  monitoring;  \n(iii)  develop  the  governance  capacity  of  local  governments  and  communities  in  the  social \nservices;  and  (iv)  support  the  implementation  of  policy  reforms,  the  performance  grants \nmechanism, and capacity-building activities under BDSSP. \n ", "20      \n \n \nA.  Components and Outputs \n82.  Sector Policy Reform. The TA project will support the PPO in undertaking studies to \nimplement the policy reforms envisaged in the agreed policy matrix. The PPO will process the \nstudies, and coordinate review and approval by the relevant departments and the necessary \nfollow-up  actions.  The  relevant  sector  departments  of  the  government  of  Balochistan  will \nmaintain close contact with the consultants working on the studies and provide them with \naccess to required information and data, as well as timely review of and comments on their \nwork. \n \n83.  Sector Planning, Management, and Monitoring. The TA project will support sector \nplanning and the development and improvement of management and monitoring systems. This \nwill include the development of sector strategies in education and health and a policy and \nstrategy  to  promote  sanitation  and  hygiene;  the  preparation  and  approval  of  expenditure \nyardsticks; the strengthening of MIS in the education and health sectors and the development of \na database for the WSS sector; and other support in sector planning and management. \n \n84.  Nongovernment organizations (NGOs) or firms will be contracted by BDSSP to support \nand assist the provincial and district governments and selected TMAs. At the provincial level, \nNGOs will be contracted to (i) support the bureau of statistics in carrying out service delivery \nsurveys (QSDS); (ii) support the finance department in public expenditure tracking surveys \n(PETS); and (iii) conduct third-party validation of the process and results of the surveys. The \ncontract at the district level will be between the district government, the provincial program \noffice, and the NGO.  \n \n85.  Local  Government  and  Community-Based  Governance.  The  TA  will  support  the \nbuilding  of  governance  capacity  through  the  PPO  activities  implemented  by  consultants, \ncontracted NGOs, and provincial training institutions, and also through linkages to other reform \nprograms like DSP and the USAID-funded ESRA programs. Capacity-building support will be \nprovided to sector managers in the districts in the preparation of medium-term and annual plans \nand  budgets,  financial  management,  monitoring,  and  reporting.  Supervisors  and  front-end \nservice delivery staff will be provided with in-service training. Support will be provided either \ndirectly or through linkages with other ongoing initiatives to relevant stakeholders to promote \ncommunity management of social service facilities. A program of civil society monitoring of \nsocial services will be prepared, and selected initiatives will be implemented on a pilot basis \nunder the TA loan. \n \n86.  BDSSP Implementation Support. This includes (i) implementation support to PPO; \n(ii) implementation support to PUs in the provincial finance department, the bureau of statistics, \nand all district governments and TMAs participating in the DSSP; and (iii) ad hoc recruitment \nsupport to PUs and local governments, to fill their need for experts for various aspects of \nprogram implementation and capacity building.  \n \nB.  Cost Estimates, Implementation Arrangements, and Other Aspects \n87.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan. The TA project is estimated to cost $6.25 million \nequivalent,  comprising  $0.18  million  in  foreign  exchange  costs  and  $6.07  million  in  local \ncurrency costs. The Government of Pakistan has requested a loan of $5 million from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources (ADF) to help finance the TA project. The loan will have a term of 32 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1% per year during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% thereafter; and other terms and conditions set forth in the draft TA Loan and \n ", " 21\nProject Agreements. The government of Balochistan will contribute $1.25 million, which is 20% \nof the total TA project cost. The contribution will be in the form of office accommodation, \ncounterpart staff, travel allowances and per diems for government counterparts, and vehicle \nprovision and operation for the PPO and PUs at the provincial and district government levels. \nThe detailed cost estimates and financing plan are given in Appendix 12 and Supplementary \nAppendix M on the TA. The Government of Pakistan will transfer the loan to the government of \nBalochistan on the same terms and conditions, except for foreign currency risk, which will be \nborne by the Government of Pakistan. \n \n88.  Executing  Agency  and  Implementation  Period.  The  provincial  P&DD  will  be  the \nExecuting  Agency.  The  organization  structure  for  implementation  is  similar  to  that  for  the \nprogram loan. The TA loan is intended to facilitate program reforms and would therefore be \nintegrated with the program loan implementation. The government of Balochistan will strive to \nintegrate common activities and processes among ADB-supported programs/projects including \nDSP and BRMP, and thereby gain efficiencies in the implementation, especially in procurement \nand consultant selection. The TA will be implemented over a period of slightly more than 4 years \nand will be completed by June 2010, a year later than the program loan completion date \n(June 2009). The training programs will be supervised by the PPO and the training materials will \nbe prepared by PPO with the help of consultants. The logistics for the training program at the \nprovincial and district levels will be managed by local institutes, which have organized similar \ntrainings in the past and have large physical and human infrastructure that can be efficiently \ndeployed for program training.  \n \n89.  Procurement and Consultant Selection. All ADB-financed procurement for the TA will \nbe in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Contact packages for $500,000 \nequivalent or less will follow local competitive bidding or, as acceptable, international shopping \nas described in Chapter III of the Guidelines for Procurement. Minor packages costing $100,000 \nequivalent or less may be procured through local competitive bidding or direct purchase in \naccordance with standard procedures of the government of Balochistan, acceptable to ADB.  \nThe training programs at the provincial and district-level would be managed by local training \ninstitutes to be selected following procedures acceptable to ADB.  \n \n90.  Consultants and consulting firms will be recruited under ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the recruitment of local consultants. \nConsultants will be hired both individually and through consulting firms. The consulting services \nrequired will include (i) 8.3 person-months of international consultants for specific tasks; and (ii) \n104 person-months of domestic consultants to support (a) the development of a training plan, \nmodules, and materials, and to train trainers, PTSMCs, water user committees, head teachers, \nschool supervisors, health service providers, and the provincial health department planning cell; \n(b) capacity building of social sector managers and service providers, women members of local \ncouncils, and district staff in MIS and monitoring; (c)  the training in planning and modern \nfinancial management systems for finance and planning office staff and social sector managers \nof the district government; and (d) the conduct of surveys and studies for the policy reforms. In \naddition, contract staff will be hired for a total of 4,242 person-months at the provincial and \ndistrict  levels  to  help  in  program  implementation  at  the  provincial  program  office  and  the \nprovincial and district PUs. \n \n91.  Disbursement, Auditing, and Reporting. The government of Balochistan will open a \ndollar imprest account with the National Bank of Pakistan within 15 days of loan effectiveness. \nThe imprest account will be established, managed, replenished, and liquidated according to \nADB\u2019s Handbook on Loan Disbursements, as amended from time to time. ADB will advance 6 \n ", "22      \n \nmonths of estimated expenditures or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower, into the \nimprest account. The ADB statement of expenditure procedure will be used when reimbursing \neligible expenditures or liquidating and replenishing the imprest account for individual payments \nof not more than $50,000. The government of Balochistan will maintain separate accounts and \nrecords for the imprest fund and TA loan expenditures in accordance with sound accounting \nprinciples. The government will have those accounts and records audited by external auditors \naccording to standards acceptable to ADB. The annual audit report will comprise the audit \nfindings  on  the  imprest  accounts  and  statement  of  expenditure  (SOE)  procedures,  and  a \nseparate audit opinion on the use of the imprest accounts and SOE procedure. Certified copies \nof the audit report will be submitted to ADB within 6 months after the close of the fiscal year. \nThe reporting and review of the TA loan will be combined with that of the program loan and will \nfollow the procedures laid down for the program loan. The quarterly, annual and TA loan \ncompletion reports, included with the reports on the program loan, will include a summary \nfinancial report on the TA loan. \n \nVI.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Program Benefits \n92.  Institutionalized Planning. Social sector planning has so far been largely ad hoc, \nnonparticipatory, and non-transparent. The social sector functionaries assigned to the districts \nhave no planning and budgeting capacity in the past. Among the BDSSP policy reforms are \nempowering local government functionaries and providing TA support in developing strategic \nplans, promoting public-private partnerships, developing self-regulation by the private sector at \nthe provincial level, and building the capacity of social sector managers in local governments to \ninstitutionalize district planning and programming and develop management capacity. BDSSP \nwill work closely with BRMP and establish synergy with other ongoing reform programs like DSP \nand the USAID-funded ESRA program. \n \n93.  Performance  Grants.  BDSSP  will  increase  funding  for  the  social  services  through \nperformance grant transfers under the BPGR 2005 promulgated by government of Balochistan. \nThe performance grants are designed to enable local governments to provide a flexible, needs-\nbased response to local conditions, adopt an effective demand-driven and participatory planning \nprocess to identify service gaps, and rationalize and develop services with full ownership of the \ninterventions decided by them. At the same time, the grants and sub-grants target priority \ninvestments in the social sectors in accordance with the provincial policy frameworks to ensure \nbalanced progress in an accelerated manner toward the MDGs and the BDSSP policy reforms. \nThe TA will assist in developing the capacity of local governments to effectively plan, implement, \nand manage their development activities. \n \n94.  Pro-poor  Services.  BDSSP  interventions  especially  target  the  needs  of  the  most \nvulnerable,  including  women  and  the  poor.  The  provision  of  merit  scholarships  and  basic \namenities in girls\u2019 schools will improve access to education for girls. Similarly, trained lady \nhealth volunteers and female doctors in health-care facilities would provide poor women with \nbetter maternal health care. Performance grant funding to local governments for basic social \nservices and the introduction of a package of minimum essential services will especially benefit \nthe poor and vulnerable.  \n \n95.  Public-Private Partnerships and Community Involvement. The BDSSP TA will help \nthe government of Balochistan develop a strategy and action plan to promote public-private \n ", " 23\npartnerships  in  social  service  delivery;  innovate  improvements  in  the  quality,  access,  and \ndelivery of social services; and develop and implement a self-regulatory mechanism for the \nprivate sector. Performance grants to local governments will support the implementation of the \nstrategy developed under the TA and promote community and private sector initiatives in the \ndelivery of services to hard-to-reach, sparsely populated areas.  \nB.  Impacts \n96.  Social Impact. BDSSP will further Balochistan\u2019s progress toward the MDGs and the \nsocial sector targets defined in the BPRSP. Initiatives aimed at improving access to education \nwould, in the long run, help increase net enrollment in and encourage completion of primary \nschool, and help reduce the gender gap in enrollment and completion rates. Similarly, better \naccess to health services would help reduce the number of underweight children, and lower \nchild mortality and maternal mortality rates. The availability of basic sanitation facilities and the \nprovision  of  safe  drinking  water  would  improve  living  conditions,  reduce  the  incidence  of \ndisease, and ultimately assist in raising the productivity of the population (Appendix 13).  \n \n97.  Gender  Impact.  BDSSP  can  improve  the  quality  of  women\u2019s  lives  and  lay  the \ngroundwork  for  greater  autonomy  for  women  in  both  the  public  and  private  spheres. \nInterventions targeting girls will accelerate progress toward increased enrollment and continued \neducation for girls at all levels of schooling. An increase in the number of women with secondary \neducation  would  also  advance  their  economic  independence  and  empowerment,  and  also \nreduce infant mortality. Increasing the capacity of female elected representatives would enable \nthem to be actively involved and have their voice heard in the management and monitoring of \npublic service facilities. In general, women\u2019s participation in public affairs would be strengthened \n(Supplementary Appendix N).  \n \n98.  Institutional Impact. BDSSP will strengthen the local government system. Its policy \nreforms will assist the government of Balochistan in defining the new role of provincial social \nsector departments under the changed relationships prescribed in BLGO 2001. BDSSP will \nassist in and provide linkages with ongoing activities to support the capacity building of local \ncouncilors, especially women councilors, to make them better able to effectively plan, manage, \nand implement initiatives to improve service delivery. It will further institutionalize community \nand  civil  society  involvement  in  local  government  affairs,  particularly  through  strengthened \nmonitoring by elected representatives and civil society, and, community involvement in the \nmanagement of social services through CCBs, PTSMCs, hospital management boards, and \nother innovative mechanisms to institutionalize citizens\u2019 voice and empowerment.  \n \n99.  Poverty  and  Economic  Impact.  By  enabling  the  local  governments,  through \nperformance grants, to spend more than they have been doing on education, health, and water \nsupply and sanitation, BDSSP will help gain greater access for the poor and vulnerable to basic \nsocial services. BDSSP, even in a small way, will help open up employment and income \nopportunities and create human and physical assets particularly in the remote and sparsely \npopulated areas, through local recruitment support to local private service providers in setting \nup  service  delivery  outlets.  Public-private  partnerships  will  also  facilitate  the  creation  of \nproductive opportunities (Supplementary Appendix O). \n \n100.  Environmental Impact. The program loan is classified as environmental category B on \nthe basis of the environmental assessment of the proposed BDSSP carried out to identify \npotential environmental outcomes and measures to prevent or mitigate adverse environmental \nimpacts. The environmental assessment of the four policy interventions has shown that most of \nthe  policy  actions  will  have  substantial  positive  impact  on  the  environment.  Any  potential \n ", "24      \n \nnegative environmental impacts of increased expenditure in the water supply, sanitation, and \nhealth sectors are adequately addressed through the eligibility criteria for the performance \ngrants and the increased capacity building for environmental management, to be supported \nunder  the  associated  TA  loan.  The  environmental  assessment  summary,  including  an \nassessment  of  the  policy  actions  and  an  environmental  management  plan,  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix P. \n \n101.  Sustainability Impact. Program sustainability is a key issue. Various factors including \nprogram  design  strengthen  sustainability.  BDSSP  is  designed  to  support  the  provincial \ngovernment\u2019s own initiative mainly emanating from BLGO 2001, which devolved social services. \nBDSSP is closely integrated and builds on the enabling environment created by DSP and \nBRMP. The performance grants will be administered through the institutional framework of the \ngovernment (BPGR 2005). The refinancing of high-interest debt with OCR funds will create \nsustainable fiscal space. The TA support to build evaluation capacities and processes will also \nhelp  make  the  program  interventions  more  sustainable.  Moreover,  empowered  local \ngovernments  and  citizens  are  expected  to  play  key  roles  in  sustaining  the  program \ninterventions.  By  supporting  public  expenditure  tracking  and  quantitative  service  delivery \nsurveys,  the  program  will  institutionalize  strong  monitoring  systems,  and  thus  improve \nefficiencies and sustainability in the long run. If, as anticipated, there will be less human and \nincome poverty, with the help of the program, there will ultimately also be less demand for social \nsector expenditures.  \nC.  Risks  \n102.  Political Risks. The political situation in Balochistan tends to be difficult. The coalition \ngovernment  has  a  wide  constituency  to  satisfy  and  therefore  faces  contending  pressures. \nDevolution is seen in some political quarters as giving up too much provincial power, so much \nso that there could be attempts to recentralize. Recent local government elections (August\u2013\nSeptember 2005), while ushering in local government representatives with a fresh mandate, had \na large number of uncontested seats, providing a grim reminder that the process is evolving and \nfar from perfect. The issue is more a matter of perspective and appreciation of the realigned \nroles and responsibilities of provincial and local governments under BLGO 2001. The policy \ndialogue during the program design must continue during program implementation to mitigate \nthe risks. BDSSP is better positioned to be involved in serious policy dialogue and mitigate \nsome of the political risks. ADB has sustained policy dialogue and interaction with senior civil \nservices and civil society in Balochistan over the past half-decade, starting with DSP and \ncontinuing with Access to Justice Program and more recently with BRMP. This medium-term \ninvolvement in Balochistan and well-orchestrated support at the program level will substantially \nreduce the perceived political risks. \n \n103.  Governance and Bureaucratic Risks. There is a risk that some people will resist the \nnew  transparent  and  accountable  processes  and  will  be  reluctant  to  change  systems.  \nTo mitigate that risk, high-level support and a high-level steering committee will be important. \nFurther  risk  mitigation  is  expected  through  BDSSP  policy  actions  including  special  audits, \npublicly available accounts and expenditures, and public grievance mechanisms. A major focus \nof BDSSP is improving social sector governance such that decisions become more transparent \nand objective and rent seeking is minimized. Vested interests might therefore be expected to \ndelay  or  undermine  the  implementation  of  reforms.  BDSSP  includes  such  risk  mitigation \nmeasures  as  building  stakeholder  ownership  during  program  design  and  implementation, \nestablishing  program  oversight  mechanisms  including  the  participation  of  local  government \ncouncil  committees,  and  ensuring  synergy  with  other  reform  programs.  Strengthening \n ", " 25\nmonitoring  systems  and  emphasizing  transparency  and  public  disclosure  would  also  help \nmitigate this risk. \n \n104.  Capacity Constraints. Fast-track devolution has brought with it a substantial agenda of \npolitical, administrative, and fiscal restructuring, new systems, rules, and guidelines, and the \nneed to train administrators and councilors. However, the local government systems must be \nfully operationalized and the provincial departments and agencies must be geared to fully \nsupport  the  process.  A  major  concern  is  the  limited  financial,  managerial,  and  technical \nresponsibilities that have been devolved in practice as well as the narrow capacity of local \ngovernment functionaries. These risks will be mitigated by policy reforms to rationalize the roles \nand responsibilities of the provincial departments in the light of their changed relationship with \nthe  local  governments  under  BLGO  2001,  and  by  the  local  government  capacity-building \nactivities financed under the TA. \n \n105.  Fiduciary Risk. During the preparation of the BRMP, the fiduciary risk to public funds \narising from the lack of accountability and transparency in financial management was identified \nas  a  concern.  BRMP  policy  reforms  are  helping  to  establish  reliable,  transparent,  and \naccountable financial management systems to address this fiduciary risk. In addition, specific \nfinancial management arrangements for the performance grants that will be funded through the \nADF loan and grant have been agreed, including the regular audit of the performance grant \nprogram. The ongoing efforts to strengthen public financial management, the project-specific \nfinancial management arrangements, and other measures and assurances will mitigate this risk. \nVII.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n106.  In addition to the standard assurances, the government of Balochistan has given the \nfollowing  specific  assurances,  which  will  be  incorporated  in  the  legal  documents.  The \ngovernment of Balochistan \n \n(i)  will ensure (a) that the objectives achieved, policies adopted, and actions taken \nprior to the date of the Loan Agreements, as set forth in the development policy \nletter and accompanying policy matrix, will continue to be in full force and effect \nfor the duration of the program period and subsequently; (b) proper and timely \nachievement,  adoption,  compliance,  and  implementation  of  the  objectives, \npolicies, and actions to be achieved, adopted, complied with, and implemented \nas set forth in the development policy letter and accompanying policy matrix; and \n(c)  that  once  achieved,  adopted,  complied  with,  and  implemented,  such \nobjectives, policies, and actions will continue to be in full force and effect during \nand subsequent to the program period. \n(ii)  will improve social sector performance through a long-term commitment. \n(iii)  will take all steps and actions, including provision of staff resources, to ensure \nsatisfactory  completion  in  a  timely  manner  of  all  program  outputs.  The \ngovernment  will  also  implement  the  program  and  monitor  and  evaluate  its \nperformance in line with the program administration memorandum as agreed with \nADB. \n(iv)  will use the entire counterpart funds generated out of the proceeds of ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds (ADF) program loan as performance grants in the social sectors. \nThe performance grant will be transferred as additionality to the regular PFC \n ", "26      \n \naward transfers to local governments, and each eligible local government will \nallocate a minimum of 20% of this performance grant to each of the social \nsectors.  \n(v)  will use the entire counterpart funds generated out of the proceeds of ADB\u2019s ADF \ngrant as performance grants to be utilized exclusively for any of the following \nactivities:  (i) increase  awareness  of  HIV/AIDS  and  measures  to  control  its \nspread;  (ii)  improve  case  detection  of  tuberculosis  and  increase  access  to \ntreatment, mainly through directly observed therapy; (iii) control malaria vectors, \nand detect and treat malaria cases; and (iv) control childhood infectious diseases \nby increasing access to the expanded program on immunization.  \n(vi)  will use the entire counterpart funds generated out of the proceeds of ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources to restructure the provincial debt through retirement of \nhigh-interest  cash  development  loans.  The  fiscal  space  created  by  such \nretirement will be utilized to provide budgetary support to the local governments \nfor the social sectors under the PFC award. \n(vii)  will  provide  the  devolved  social  services  with  appropriate  administrative, \nfinancial, and operational autonomy and, for areas where powers have not yet \nbeen devolved, will formulate a transition arrangement indicating when and how \nsuch powers will be devolved. \n(viii)  will ensure that none of the functions and responsibilities devolved to the local \ngovernment will be recentralized. \n(ix)  will undertake appropriate actions to achieve clarity on the roles, responsibilities, \nand accountabilities of the provincial social sector departments in the context of \nBLGO  2001  to  ensure  clear  distinctions  in  the  mandates  of  social  sector \ndepartments in the district governments. \n(x)  will  ensure  continuous  support  and  assistance  to  the  local  governments  to \nimprove their (a) budgeting and financial management capacity; (b) planning, \nprogramming,  and  design  of  development  schemes  and  projects;  \n(c) supervision and implementation of development works; (d) operation and \nmaintenance; and (e) monitoring and evaluation.  \n(xi)  will ensure that the performance grant mechanisms and procedures including \nthose for the eligibility of local governments, award of grant, and timely transfer of \ngrant, monitoring, reporting, audit, and other aspects, will be consistent with the \nBalochistan Performance Grants Rules 2005. \n(xii)  will ensure that the implementation of works under performance grants will not \nentail  any  land  acquisition  or  resettlement.  In  the  event  of  unforeseen  land \nacquisition or resettlement, the government will ensure that (a) all land acquired \nfor  the  program  will  be  state  land,  free  from  any  encumbrances,  structures, \nhuman settlements, or cultivation; (b) no person will be adversely affected, as \nprovided  in  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement;  and  (c)  the  requisite \nresettlement plan(s) are prepared, in consultation with ADB and in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. In that case, any award of civil \nworks  contracts  will  be  conditional  on  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  such  resettlement \nplan(s). \n(xiii)  will  ensure  that  the  program  and  the  TA  project  loan  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance with the environmental rules and regulations applicable in Pakistan \n ", " 27\nand  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Policy  (2002).  The  government  will  ensure  that \nadequate  environmental  protection  and  safety  measures  are  included  in  the \ndesign of the program facilities and that the program facilities are constructed, \noperated, and maintained in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Policy. The \ngovernment  will  ensure  the  implementation  of  environmental  monitoring  and \nmitigation  measures  and  the  environmental  plan  set  out  in  Supplementary \nAppendix P, and will also ensure that the environmental criteria for performance \ngrants components adhere to overall selection requirements and sector-specific \nrequirements laid out in Supplementary Appendix P.  \n(xiv)  will allocate and make available, in a timely manner, the necessary counterpart \nfunds from its budget for each fiscal year to ensure the smooth implementation of \nthe TA Project. \n(xv)  will ensure that in carrying out the policy measures and activities included under \nthe program loan and the policy matrix, due consideration is given to the findings \nand recommendations of the TA Project. The Government will allow ADB to \nprovide comments on the findings and recommendations of the TA project loan, \nfor  consideration  in  policy  measures  for  this  and  upcoming  programs  in \nBalochistan or other programs of similar nature in Pakistan. \n(xvi)  acknowledges, with the Government of Pakistan that ADB, consistent with its \ncommitment to good governance, accountability and transparency, reserves the \nright  to  undertake,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  investigation  of  any  public \nimpropriety in the conduct of the program. The Government will cooperate fully \nand ensure that all agencies of the provincial government cooperate with any \nsuch  investigation  and  extend  all  necessary  assistance,  including  access  to \nrelevant books, files, and records.  \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n107.  The following conditions for loan effectiveness of the program loan and the TA project \nloan will be incorporated into the loan agreements: (i) the Planning Commission Proforma II for \nthe TA project loan will have been duly approved by the competent authority; and (ii) the \nprovincial steering committee under BDSSP will have been established.  \n \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n108.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans and grant would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve: \n \n(i)  the loan of $130 million to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Balochistan \nDevolved Social Services Program from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with \ninterest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)\u2013based lending facility; a term of 15 years, including a grace period \nof  3  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan and Program Agreements \npresented to the Board; \n \n(ii)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 45,066,000 to \nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Balochistan Devolved Social Services \nProgram from ADB\u2019s Special Fund resources with an interest charge at the rate \nof 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter;  \n ", "28      \n \na term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \nFinancing and Program Agreements presented to the Board;  \n \n(iii)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 3,466,000 to \nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan for technical assistance for the Balochistan \nDevolved Social Services Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an \ninterest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% \nper annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft Technical Assistance Loan and Project Agreements \npresented to the Board; and \n \n(iv)  the grant not exceeding the equivalent of $5 million to the Islamic Republic of \nPakistan, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, for the Balochistan Devolved \nSocial Services Program substantially in accordance with terms and conditions \nset forth in the draft Financing and Program Agreements presented to the Board.  \n \n \n \n \n   \n  Haruhiko Kuroda \n  President \n   \n   \n4  November 2005 \n ", "                                                                                                                              Appendix 1  29\nPROGRAM DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets/Indicators  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary    Mechanisms   and Risks  \nA.

Overview. The government of Balochistan requires additional financial resources to \nachieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and targets set in the Balochistan Poverty \nReduction Strategy Paper (BPRSP). The government has expressed its commitment to improve \nthe provision of social services in the BPRSP, which is based on the MDGs. The estimated \nfinancial implications of the BPRSP were included in the medium-term budgetary framework \n(MTBF) for FY2004\u2013FY2006, and updated in the medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF) for \nFY2006\u2013FY2008. \n \n2.  Unfortunately, budget growth has been less than the worst-case scenario in the MTBF. It \nis  also  necessary  to  accelerate  improvement  in  the  social  sectors,  to  improve  the  social \nindicators to the levels achieved in other provinces in Pakistan, and to achieve the MDGs on \ntime. The government of Balochistan therefore needs a large amount of additional financial \nresources for the social sectors for the next several years. The Balochistan Devolved Social \nServices Program (BDSSP) will provide the provincial government with the additional financial \nresources  to  meet  the  resource  gap  and  finance  eligible  district  governments  through \nperformance grants. \n \n3.  Resources of the Government of Balochistan. The revenue receipts of the provincial \ngovernment are heavily dependent on transfers from the federal Government, but the recent \nincrease in revenue receipts was primarily due to a gradual increase in the revenues of the \nprovince itself. Revenue receipts grew at an average annual rate of 10.5% between FY2002 \nand FY2005, and totaled PRs30.9 billion in FY2005 (Table A2.1). The revenue receipts consist \nlargely of federal transfers and grants (about 95%); provincial revenues make up about 5%. The \nfederal  transfers  grew  by  an  average  1.8%  yearly  between  FY2002  and  FY2005,  while \nprovincial revenues increased yearly by an average of 13.1%. The resources for development, \non the other hand, come from four major sources: net surplus from revenue, capital, and public \naccounts, and development receipts. Development resources were PRs12.8 billion in FY2005. \n \n4.  Expenditure of the Government of Balochistan. The major revenue expenditure items \nof the government have been provincial allocable, general administration, and debt servicing. \nThe revenue expenditure increased at an annual average rate of 12.9% between FY2002 and \nFY2005, and totaled PRs28.5 billion in FY2005. As a result of the administrative and financial \ndevolution following the passage of Balochistan Local Government Ordinance (BLGO) 2001, \nmore than two thirds of the revenue expenditure has been allocated to provincial allocable. \nGeneral administration has been allocated 9.5\u201314.3%, and debt servicing 10.8\u201315.2%. The \ndevelopment expenditure, on the other hand, has been equal to development resources; the \ngovernment of Balochistan has used all development resources each year. \n \n5.  Provincial  Allocable.  Since  the  passage  of  BLGO  2001,  several  functions  of  the \nprovincial departments have been devolved to the local governments. As a result, a large \nportion of the revenue expenditure was allocated to provincial allocable, most of which went to \nlocal governments as grants. In the budget for FY2002, out of the total current expenditure of \nPRs19.8 billion, PRs6.7 billion (33.8%) was allocated to provincial allocable. This portion has \nincreased at an average annual rate of 15.2%, and reached PRs10.4 billion in FY2005. \n \n6.  The provincial allocable in Balochistan is shared among the local governments by the \nprovincial  finance  commission  (PFC)  according  to  the  governments\u2019  historical  expenditure \npatterns. Such an allocation mechanism is possible because the grants primarily support the \n ", "34       Appendix 2 \n \nsalaries of local government staff, whose number does not substantially change from one year \nto the next, and charged expenditures, such as utility payments. \n \nTable A2.1: Summary of Fiscal Accounts of the Provincial Government of Balochistan \n(PRs million) \nItem  FY2002  FY2003  FY2004  FY2005 \n  RE  RE  RE  BE \nA.

Debt Servicing. The total debt liability of the government of Balochistan at the end of \nFY2003 was PRs38.1 billion. This entails a large debt service. Foreign and local loans in \nFY2003 were PRs22.7 billion and PRs15.4 billion, respectively. Local loans are predominantly  \ncash development loans (CDLs) (PRs12 billion in FY2003) from the federal Government. Of \nthese loans, PRs10.1 billion carries interest of more than 14.5% yearly, PRs6.3 billion bears \ninterest  ranging  from  15.1%  to  17%,  and  PRs0.76  billion  bears  interest  above  17%.  The \nservicing cost of all loans in FY2004 was PRs2.6 billion (of which PRs2.3 billion was for CDLs), \nabsorbing 10.7% of total revenue expenditure. The debt service increased to 3.5 billion in \nFY2005,  or  12.5%  of  total  revenue  expenditure.  The  Balochistan  Resource  Management \n ", "                                                                                                                         Appendix 2  35\nProgram (BRMP) is providing $110 million, which will be used to restructure PRs6 billion of \nCDLs, leaving, the province, by its own estimates, with around PRs8.5 billion in high-interest \ndebt. \n \n8.  Social Sector Expenditure. The revenue expenditure for the social sectors appears to \nbe comparatively small at first glance, but in fact took up more than a third of the total revenue \nexpenditure in FY2004. After the passage of BLGO 2001, the provision of education, health, \nand water supply and sanitation (WSS) services, among others, became the responsibility of \nboth the provincial government and the 27 district governments. Since FY2003, the provincial \ngovernment budget has been prepared and approved by the provincial government, and the \ndistrict government budget by the respective district councils. To capture the whole social sector \nbudget of Balochistan, therefore, the social sector expenditure of each district government has \nto be taken into consideration, in addition to the social sector budget of the province. Because of \nthe limited availability of budget data in district governments,1 Table A2.2 uses FY2004 figures. \nThe revenue expenditure of the provincial government for the social sectors was only 8.4%. In \naddition to this, 25.1% of the total revenue expenditure was allocated to the social sectors of the \n27 district governments. Overall, 33.5% of the revenue expenditure was spent on the social \nsector in FY2004. \n \nTable A2.2: Social Sector Budget of the Government of Balochistan, FY2004 \n(PRs million) \nProvincial  27 District  Salary /  Revenue / \nItem  Government  Governments  Total  Non-salary  Development \nA.

The prominent characteristic of the social sector expenditure is that there is a large \nproportion of salary payment and thin non-salary and development expenditures. The total of \n                                                 \n1  The provincial finance department did not have complete sets of FY2002/3 budgets for 26 district governments and \nhad not yet received the FY2004/5 budgets from the districts. \n ", "36       Appendix 2 \n \nthe revenue expenditure and public sector development program expenditure in FY2004 was \nPRs41.2 billion, of which 26.9% (PRs11.1 billion) was allocated to the social sector. The total \nrevenue expenditure of the provincial and district governments for the social sectors in FY2004 \nwas PRs8.2 billion; most of this was used for salary payment and a small proportion was left for \nnon-salary  expenditure.  Salary  payments  took  up  90.1%  of  the  revenue  expenditure  for \neducation, 66.2% for health, and 40.4% for WSS. Overall, salary payments made up 73.9% of \nthe revenue expenditure for the social sectors. \n \n10.  The development expenditure, on the other hand, was PRs2.8 billion in FY2004, all for \nthe provincial government; no allocation was made to the district governments. The provincial \ndevelopment programs included schemes that fall within the mandate of the local governments \nas defined by BLGO 2001, such as construction of boundary walls around schools, addition of \nclassrooms, or provision of drinking water, toilets, or electricity connection. \n \n11.  Among three social sectors, education was the priority sector in both provincial and \ndistrict governments. Of the social sector expenditure of PRs11.1 billion, education had the \nlargest share at 61.2%, health 22.7%, and WSS 16.2%. \n \n12.  Medium-Term Budget Framework (MTBF). The MTBF provided rudimentary revenue \nprojections and estimates of the additional amounts needed for poverty reduction between \nFY2003 and FY2005, but the actual budgets of the province for the same period were less than \nthe worst-case MTBF projection. Two different scenarios were presented in the MTBF on the \nbasis of different assumptions for the revenue projections. The best-case scenario estimated \nthe  3-year  revenue  at  PRs102.0  billion;  the  worst-case  scenario  at  PRs82.8  billion.  The \nassumptions for the expenditure projections were the same for both best-case and worst-case \nscenarios\u2014an  annual  increase  of  9%  for  revenue  expenditure  and  12%  for  development \nexpenditure. \n \n13.  MTBF  envisaged  the  allocation  of  the  revenue  surplus  during  the  3-year  period\u2014 \nestimated at PRs13.2 billion under the worst-case scenario and PRs18.0 billion under the best-\ncase scenario\u2014to poverty reduction. Assuming that allocation to social sector expenditure in \nFY2003\u2013FY2005  would  be  the  same  as  in  FY2004  (26.9%  of  the  revenue  surplus),  \nPRs3.6 billion would have been allocated under the worst-case scenario, and PRs4.8 billion \nunder the best-case scenario, just to balance revenue and expenditure. Unfortunately, however, \nthe  actual  revenues  in  FY2003\u2013FY2005  were  15%  lower  than  foreseen  in  the  worst-case \nscenario. Accordingly, the level of the expenditure was also downsized to match the actual \nrevenue. Insufficient social sector expenditure in comparison with the MTBF base-case scenario \nsuggests that less progress was made in achieving the BPRSP goals between FY2003 and \nFY2005. \n \n14.  Medium-Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF). The MTFF included in the white paper for \nFY2005 budget projected a financial gap between FY2005 and FY2008. The MTFF assumed \nthat  the  transfers  from  the  federal  Government  would  increase  by  13.2%  and  provincial \nrevenues  by  12.0%.  On  the  expenditure  side,  the  salary  expenditure  and  pensions  were \nexpected to increase by 5.0%, and non-salary expenditure was seen to grow by 15.0%. As a \nresult of a budgetary simulation, a financial gap of PRs91.2 billion was identified between \nFY2006 to FY2010. It was expected to be financed through regular foreign project and program \nassistance, and grants from the federal Government. If 26.9% of the total expenditure were to \nbe allocated to the social sectors, the financing gap in social sectors between FY2006 and \nFY2010 would be about PRs24.8 billion ($415 million). \n \n ", "                                                                                                                         Appendix 2  37\n15.  BDSSP  and  MTFF.  The  program  is  in  line  with  MTFF  and  the  poverty  reduction \nstrategy, and will provide budget support to fill part of the financing gap in the social sectors. \nThe funding required for achieving the program outcomes would be less than the financing gap, \nsince the MTFF incorporates a wider scope of activities in the social sectors. An attempt was \nmade to estimate the funding requirement, by calculating the approximate cost of achieving the \nmajor target indicators in the program outcomes between 2006 and 2010. \n \n16.  Education Sector. It is assumed that female net enrollment rates in primary school and \ngross enrollment in middle schools will improve from 24% to 40% and from 18% to 30%, \nrespectively, between 2006 and 2010. This will result in an increase of about 493,000 pupils. \nFinancing will be required for 2,100 new schools. If the per capita annual recurrent cost is \nassumed to be PRs4,700 for primary education and PRs5,300 for middle education, and the \nconstruction cost of a building is PRs500,000 for primary education and PRs750,000 for middle \neducation, the total cost between 2006 and 2010 would be about PRs5.0 billion. \n \n17.  Health Sector. It is assumed that full child immunization will increase from 24% to 70%, \nand child delivery by skilled attendants from 24% to 35% between 2006 and 2010. As a result, \nan additional 1.6 million under-5 children will have to be fully immunized and more than 2 million \nwill have to be provided other child-care needs to reduce child mortality. In addition, 132,000 \nmore  children  will  be  delivered  by  skilled  attendants.  The  additional  cost  of  combating \nHIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria is expected to be more than PRs1 billion, while the cost of \nreducing child mortality and morbidity is expected to be PRs2.5 billion. The expected cost of \nreducing  maternal  mortality  and  morbidity  is  PRs1.3  billion.  The  total  additional  cost  for \naccelerating progress toward health MDGs between 2006 and 2010 would be about PRs4.8 \nbillion. \n \n18.  WSS Sector. It is assumed that access to excreta disposal will increase from 40% to \n55%, access to solid waste collection/disposal from 5% to 10%, and access to water supply \ncoverage from 5% to 10% between 2006 and 2010. This will mean that 1.5 million more people \nwill  have  access  to  excreta  disposal,  426,000  more  will  have  access  to  solid  waste \ncollection/disposal, and 1.4 million more will have access to water supply. Since the unit costs of \nexcreta disposal, solid waste collection/disposal, and water supply are PRs1,500, PRs25, and \nPRs2,500, respectively, the total cost between 2006 and 2010 would be PRs5.8 billion.  \n \n19.  The total cost of implementing policies and facilitation is estimated at PRs15.7 billion \n($261 million) and is summarized in Table A2.3. It must be noted, however, that the real funding \nrequirement is higher than the estimate, as the costs of some inputs required to achieve the \nprogram outcomes have not been captured because of the limited availability of information. \n \nTable A2.3: Funding Requirement to Achieve BDSSP Outcomes, 2006\u20132110 \n(PRs million) \nItem  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010  Total \nEducation Sector  650  800  950  1,100  1,540  5,040 \nHealth Sector  600  700  900  1,100  1,500  4,800 \nWSS Sector  990  1,070  1,157  1,251  1,353  5,821 \n  Total  2,240  2,570  3,007  3,451  4,393  15,661 \nBDSSP = Balochistan Devolved Social Services Program, WSS = water supply and sanitation. \nSource: ADB. 2005.

The education sector in Balochistan faces numerous challenges: vast distances, lack of \ninfrastructure,  poor  communications,  cultural  diversity,  and  limited  human  resources. \nBalochistan\u2019s overall literacy rate (10 years and above) is 28% (16% for females and 39% for \nmales)\u2014the  lowest  among  the  four  provinces  of  Pakistan  (Pakistan\u2019s  literacy  rate  is  45% \noverall,  32%  for  females  and  58%  for  males).  Table  A3.1  shows  the  relative  position  of \nBalochistan in Pakistan in literacy and education.  \n \nTable A3.1: Literacy and Education in Pakistan and Balochistan \n  Pakistan  Balochistan \nIndicator  1995/96  2001/02  1995/96  2003  \nPIHS  PIHS  PIHS  MICS \n  Total  Urban  Rural \nA.

Quetta. \n \n2.  School Enrollment. Balochistan\u2019s gross primary school enrollment rates (government \nschools, excluding classes functioning in temporary buildings) shows a significant disparity \nbetween male and female enrollment (Table A3.2). At the middle school level, there is an \nincreased disparity between male and female enrollment in urban areas, and this disparity is \nparticularly  significant  in  the  rural  areas,  where,  apart  from  Sindh  with  its  female  gross \nenrollment rate of 8%, the enrollment rate of 11% in Balochistan is much lower than in other \nprovinces. Similar gender disparities appear at the matriculation level. At 29%, the overall \nmatriculation enrollment rate for Balochistan is the lowest in the province (Punjab 44%, Sindh \n42%, and North West Frontier Province 41%). \n \n3.  Continuation.  Table  A3.3  shows  that  in  2003,  the  government  school  system  in \nBalochistan had a total enrollment of 566,242 students. The continuation rate from primary to \nmiddle school was about 23%, and from middle into high school about 39%. The enrollment at \nthe middle level urban schools was about 40% of the primary level enrollment, but in the rural \nareas this was only about 14%, highlighting the significantly reduced continuation rates from \nprimary schooling for rural populations. The continuation rate from middle to high school was \nabout 44% for urban enrollment, and about 30% for rural enrollment. This indicates that for rural \nstudents completion of primary school significantly improves the likelihood of continuation into \nhigh school. The continuation rates for rural females are particularly low, at 10% from primary \ninto middle school, and 22% from middle into high school, again showing that completion of \nprimary school significantly increases continuation into high school. \n ", "                 Appendix 3    39\nTable A3.2: Balochistan Gross Enrollment Rates, Primary Level, 2001/02 \nArea   (Government Schools,  Middle Level  Matriculation Level \nexcluding Katchi Classes) \n  Male  Female  Both  Male  Female  Both  Male  Female  Both \nUrban   72  61  67  70  50  61  61  30  45 \nRural  71  37  56  41  11  28  39  9  26 \nOverall   71  41  57  45  18  33  42  13  29 \nSource: Government of Pakistan. 2002.

Pakistan is a signatory to the Dakar \nGoals and the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) to eliminate gender disparities in primary \nand secondary education by 2005, and achieve gender equality in education by 2015. Part of \nthe National Education for All (EFA) National Action Plan (2000\u20132015) is the Education Sector \nReform (ESR) Action Plan 2001\u20132004, with a range of medium-term targets. The targets for \n2001\u20132004 included improvement in the literacy rate from 49% to 60%; the primary enrollment \nrate from 66% to 76%; middle school enrollment from 47.5% to 55%; and secondary school \nenrollment from 29.5% to 40%. Given the data provided above for ESR literacy and the primary, \nmiddle  school,  and  secondary  targets,  the  education  system  in  Balochistan  requires \nimprovements of 24%, 19%, 22%, and 11%, respectively, in these areas just to reach the 2004 \nESR targets. In Balochistan, therefore, a serious weakness exists in achieving two dimensions \nof the universalization of primary education, i.e., universal access/enrollment, and universal \nretention. Despite the fact that the provincial government has assigned priority and given focus \nto female and rural education, gender and regional disparities remain, and these are well behind \nESR targets. \n \n5.  Building  on  Past  Successful  Approaches  in  Education.  A  number  of  innovative \napproaches have been widely recognized as successful in increasing girls\u2019 access, enrolment, \nand retention; increasing community participation in school management; and involving the \nprivate  sector  in  school  education.  The  policy  and  program  responses  to  the  challenging \neducation scenario must build on past successful approaches, adapted to a devolved setting.1  \n                                                 \n1 The Community Support Process, launched in 1992, as part of a mobile female teacher training program, has led to \na partnership between government and girls\u2019 parents in the communities that was facilitated by village education \ncommittees. The mobile female teacher training program, with its cluster-based approach, was successful. The \nrequisite qualification for teaching appointments was relaxed in difficult areas. The Fellow School Program was an \nimportant and innovative component of the Balochistan Primary Education Project. The schools were given a \nsubsidy for facility maintenance, an enrollment subsidy, and an attendance bonus. In 1995\u20131998, more than \n10,000 parent-teacher school management committees (PTSMCs) were formed.

Child Mortality. The infant mortality rate (IMR) in Balochistan is 104, with an urban-rural \nvariation of 88 and 106 per 1,000 live births, respectively, and a male-female sex variation of \n101 and 108, respectively (Table A3.4). Around 158 out of 1,000 children do not reach their fifth \nbirthday. Under-5 mortality in rural areas, at 164, is much higher than in urban children, at  \n130 per 1,000 live births. On the pattern of IMR, children of literate mothers have a much lower \nmortality of 97 per 1,000 live births, compared with children of illiterate mothers, at 168 per \n1,000 live births. About 4 out of every 10 children (43.3%) are underweight for their age, while \nthe  National  Nutrition  Survey  of  2001/02  projected  a  figure  of  35.3%  among  children  \n6\u201359 months in Balochistan province. The bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) scar was noted in \n32% of children under 2 years, with reporting as low as 5% in certain districts (Killa Abdullah, \nBarkhan,  and  Kohlu).  According  to  the  EPI  coverage  survey  of  2001,  35%  children  \n12\u201323 months old were fully immunized. \nTable A3.4: Maternal and Child Health in Balochistan and Pakistan Compared  \n   Pakistan   Balochistan \nIndicator  1995/96  2001/02    2003 MICS \nPIHS  PIHS \n         Total  Urban  Rural \nInfant mortality rate, per 1,000  101  82    104  88  106 \nFull immunization rate (%), 2\u201323 months  45  53    24  24  24 \nTotal fertility rate  4.58  3.48     7  7  7 \nDelivery by skilled attendant (%)   61  62     21  47  16 \nContraceptive prevalence rate (%)  13  19     15  35  10 \nMICS = multiple indicator cluster survey, PIHS = Pakistan Integrated Household Survey. \nSources:  Government of Pakistan. 1996.

Child mortality varies widely by region, and is lowest in Kech region (IMR 44 and under \nfive year mortality rate (U5MR) 58), and highest in Loralai region (IMR 121 and U5MR 190). \nChild mortality among poor families is much higher than among families that are economically \nbetter off. Sibi region is cited to show rich-poor differences (taking Dera Bugti and Kohlu districts \nas poor), with IMR and U5MR among the poor of 119 and 187 per 1,000 live births, respectively, \ncompared with 67 and 94, respectively, in better-off families.  \n8.  Maternal Health. According to the multiple indicator cluster survey (MICS), 2003 20% of \npregnant women\u201442% urban and 16% rural\u2014availed themselves of prenatal care services \nfrom trained birth attendants. Skilled birth attendants assisted 21% of women during delivery\u2014\n44% urban women and 16% rural women. The use of postnatal care by women in the first 40 \ndays after delivery was also found to be very low, at 19% overall, with an urban-rural variation of \n41% and 17%, respectively. Overall, one of every five pregnant woman in Balochistan used the \nservices of a trained birth attendant during pregnancy and delivery, and in the postpartum \nperiod. The use of modern contraceptives was as low as 14% (21% for all methods); in 12 \n                                                                                                                                                          \nWashington, DC; Government of Pakistan. 2002; World Bank. 1998.

Pakistan\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) 2003 sees \nthe revival of growth and the reduction of poverty as twin challenges for Pakistan, and considers \nthe Government\u2019s commitment to improving public service delivery as central to achieving these \ngoals. The human development strategies focus especially on women and children, the most \nvulnerable sections of society. The National Health Policy (NHP) of 2001 focuses on health \nsector  investments  as  part  of  poverty  reduction,  and  also  accords  priority  to  primary  and \nsecondary  care  delivery  systems.  Both  the  federal  PRSP  and  the  NHP  refer  to  tackling \nmalnutrition  and  other  nutritional  deficiencies,  which  afflict  mostly  women  and  children.  \nA national nutrition program is also part of this strategy. The Perspective Development Plan \n2001\u20132011 contains strategies for addressing nutrition issues. The Interim Population Sector \nPerspective Plan mentions population stabilization as a means of achieving the goals of the \nfederal  PRSP,  and  proposes  reducing  the  population  growth  rate  to  1.9%  by  2004  (not \nachieved). The related targets include: (i) increasing contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) to \n57% by 2012; (ii) sustaining the increase in the marriageable age for girls; and (iii) decreasing \nthe population growth rate to 1.6% by 2012. In health, innovative methods of recruiting lady \nhealth volunteers, including identifying high school girls and supporting them with stipends as \nfuture paramedical trainees, have been appreciated.2 \n \n10.  The Balochistan PRSP 2003, in line with the federal PRSP and national population \npolicies, has highlighted the following strategies to improve the health status of the population \nand address the poverty of opportunities: (i) significantly improve the health indicators for the \npoor; (ii) improve the health management structure; (iii) reorganize health facilities and fill \nservice  gaps;  (iv)  control  population  growth;  (v)  improve  health  service  delivery  through \nincreased resources, efficiency, and responsiveness particularly for communicable diseases \nand  services  for  women  and  children  (MDGs  4,  5,  and  6);  (vi)  promote  public-private \npartnerships; and (vii) increase reliance on the private sector with adequate regulation. \n11.  Private  Health  Sector.  The  private  health  sector  comprises  mostly  private  clinics \nmanned by a general duty doctor and a paramedic/nurse or a less qualified person. Inpatient \nand outpatient specialized services are also available but only in Quetta city. The 22 private \nhospitals manage low-risk patients while charging high rates. State-of-the art private tertiary \ncare hospitals do not exist in the province. Moonlighting (practice after office hours) is common \namong by public sector doctors. The more than 3,500 registered pharmacies, mostly in urban \nareas, sell drugs over the counter with limited prescribing. \nC.  Water Supply and Sanitation \n \n12.  Overview. The water supply and sanitation indicators for Balochistan are far lower than \nfor the country as a whole, and the disparity is even greater in the rural areas (Table A3.5).  \n13.  Nearly one half of the population of the province relies on unprotected wells, ponds, \nrivers, canals, or streams for their drinking water needs. In the urban areas, nearly 80% of the \npopulation has access to piped water inside (74%) or outside (5%) the house and another 10% \nto other improved sources. In rural areas, these figures are 15%, 3%, and 26%, respectively, \nwith only 38% of the rural population having access to improved sources of water within a 2 km \nor half-hour distance from their homes. The burden of fetching water largely falls on the women \nand  girls.  Where  groundwater  is  available,  there  is  the  problem  of  overdrawing  due  to \n                                                 \n2  World Bank. 1998.

Adequate excreta disposal facilities are not \navailable to 71% of the rural population, wastewater disposal is available to barely 1%, and \nthere is no solid waste collection and disposal system. Most schools lack proper latrines, posing \nproblems especially for girls. Garbage litters the landscape, particularly in urban areas and \nalong main roads. Urban solid waste coverage outside Quetta is mainly in Gwadar district (13%) \nand Kila Abdullah district (10%); in other districts it is less than 3%. There is no sanitary landfill \nsite and wastewater treatment plant in any urban or rural settlement in Balochistan.   \n14.  Water Supply. As shown in Table A3.6, there are wide variations in access to improved \nsources of water inside the house among the various districts of the province. There are 6,554 \nrural settlements (of which 540 are uninhabited) with a population of 4,997,105.

Less than 50% of the solid waste generated in Chiltan \ntown is collected by the tehsil municipal administration (TMA). The remaining solid waste is left \nlying in the streets or in open plots. The solid waste is transported to the dumping site outside \nthe city. Similarly no TMA has proper facilities for the collection and sanitary disposal of hospital \nwaste. In other towns, overall, only 26% of the population has solid waste disposal facilities. \nHouseholds dump their solid waste in adjacent open plots or in the lanes. In the absence of \ndisposal systems, solid waste piles up in every village. Dumping the waste in plastic bags \nprevents it from being used as manure in the fields. The private sector is participating in the \nrecycling of materials, like paper, glass, and iron, produced as waste from the houses.  \nTable A3.7: Access to Adequate Sanitation \nin the Districts of Balochistan \nLow (4\u201325%)  Medium (26\u201350%)  High (51\u201385%) \nAwaran, Barkhan, Dera Bugti, Jhal Magsi,  Bolan, Chagai, Gawadur, Jafarabad,  Kalat, Kech, Mastung, \nKharan, Killa Abdullah, Killa Saifullah, Kohlu,  Khuzdar, Lasbela, Nasirabad, Nushki,  Panjgur, Quetta,  \nLoralai, Musakhel, Pishin, Zhob, Ziarat  Sibi \nSource:  Government of Balochistan. 2003.

The  progress  achieved  and  the  remaining  challenges  for  the  attainment  of  the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) related to education, health, and water supply and \nsanitation (WSS) in Balochistan are shown in the Table A4 below: \n \nTable A4: Status of Education, Health, and WSS MDGs in Balochistan \nGoal/Target  Status \nGoal 2: Achieve  The levels of achievement in net enrollment rates indicate that without concerted effort in the \nuniversal primary  right direction, universal primary education may not be achieved by 2015. \neducation \nGoal 3, Target 4:  The primary schools gross enrollment ratio of girls to boys has increased from 0.34 in 1991 to \nEliminate gender  0.58 by 2003, but the increase falls short of MDG of achieving gender parity by 2005. The \ndisparity in  ratio of girls to boys in net enrollment increased from 0.45 in 1991 to 0.61 in 2001, which again \neducation  falls short of the goal. \nGoal 4: Child  The under-5 mortality at the national level fell from an estimated 138 in 1990 to 110 per 1,000 \nHealth. Reduce  live births in 2000. Balochistan has a higher U5MR; substantial investments would therefore \nthe under-5  be needed to expand and implement internationally accepted strategies to lower U5MR in the \nmortality rate  by  province. \ntwo thirds   \nGoal 4: Maternal  Indicator 17: Prenatal care.  Prenatal care services improved by 0.5 percentage point per \nHealth. Reduce  year over the previous 15 years, from 14% in 1986/91 to 21% in 1999/2001. \nmaternal mortality  Assistance during delivery. Only 21% of deliveries were attended by trained birth attendants \nby three fourths  in 2003, compared with 10.4% in 1990.  \nGoal 6, Target 8:  HIV/AIDS: From a status of low prevalence but high risk, HIV/AIDS in Pakistan became a \nHalt by 2015 and  concentrated epidemic in 2004 reportedly because of injecting drug users in Larkana and \nbegin to reverse  Karachi cities, and in Quetta city. Current users of any method of family planning among non-\nthe spread of  pregnant women 15\u201349 years increased from 2% in 1990/91 to 21% in 2003/04. \nHIV/AIDS, malaria,  Malaria: The malaria control program is being implemented in line with the World Health \nand other  Organization\u2019s \u201cRollback Malaria\u201d strategy. It is likely that Balochistan province can meet goal \ndiseases  6 provided additional resources are made available to address the challenges. \nTuberculosis. The overall incidence of tuberculosis is 177 cases per 100,000, and that of \nsputum-positive pulmonary tuberculosis is 80 cases per 100,000 population, according to a \n1987/88 survey. \nGoal 7, Target 10:  The MDG for water supply would therefore be to reduce the percentage of the population \nWater Supply.  without access to water supply from 54% in MICS 2003/04 to 27% by 2015. In 1998\u20132001 the \nHalve, by 2015,  population without access to water decreased by about 2% per year, whereas between 2001 \nthe proportion of  to 2003 the decrease was 8%, for an average of 4.4% per year during the 1998\u20132003 period. \npeople without  If the population without access continues to decline according to this trend with the present \nsustainable  levels of investment in the sector in real terms, the population without access in the year 2015 \naccess to safe  would be 32%. This leaves an unmet gap of 5% when compared with the MDG target of 27%. \ndrinking water   The additional investment under BDSSP would help bridge this gap. \nGoal 7:  MDG targets for sanitation for 2015 are not defined; therefore, targets similar to those for \nSanitation  water supply have been adopted. Taking MICS (2003) as the basis, the MDG targets for 2015 \nwould be to halve the population without access to sanitation\u2014from the 90% reported in MICS \nto 45% by 2015. In 1998\u20132001 the decrease in population without access to sanitation was \n2.3% per year. This trend has been assumed to continue till 2015, resulting in 63% of the \npopulation without access to sanitation by 2015, compared with the MDG of 45%, leaving a \nvery large unfilled gap at the present low levels of investment in sanitation. If a significant \nproportion of the sector investment under BDSSP were to go to sanitation, a part of this gap \nwould be filled. \nBDSSP = Balochistan Devolved Social Services Program, HIV/AIDS = human immunodeficiency virus/ acquired \nimmunodeficiency syndrome, MDG = millennium development goals, MICS = multiple indicator cluster survey, U5MR \n= under five mortality rate.  \nSource: ADB. 2005.

Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) \n \n1.  Balochistan can no longer be classified as a low-prevalence province, as a concentrated \nepidemic has already occurred among injecting drug users (IDUs) in the provincial capital, \nQuetta. There are about 500\u20131,000 people living with AIDS (PLWAs) in the 10\u201324 age group in \nthe  province.  The  slow  pace  in  expanding  the  response  to  human  immunodeficiency \nvirus/acquired  immunodeficiency  syndrome  (HIV/AIDS)  epidemic  under  the  Balochistan \nEnhanced HIV/AIDS Control Program1 is cause for concern, as the window of opportunity in \nresponding to the epidemic is fast closing and further delays could lead to a generalized \nepidemic.  \n  \n2.  Among  the  potential  gaps  in  effectively  serving  known  high-risk  groups  are:  \n(i) the absence of a package of preventive services, including sexually transmitted infection \n(STI) and voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) services and condom availability, to protect \nthe laborers who have flocked to Gawadar because of its port development project; and (ii) the \nabsence  of  a  comprehensive  response  to  the  IDU  population,  e.g.,  detoxification  and \nrehabilitation preparatory to reintegration into society, in addition to harm reduction, the only \nservices planned.  \n \n3.  The STI control services through approved programs are restricted to the training of 50 \ndoctors from public sector teaching and district hospitals and 30 private sector doctors from the \ncapital city, the development of guidelines for syndromic management of STI cases, and limited \nsupply of STI drugs to public sector hospitals. Potential gaps include: (i) lack of skills among the \nmedical staff in general in the syndromic approach to STI services and counseling of STI \npatients on condom use and other matters, and the scanty allocation in the ongoing project for \ntraining in STI service management in the public sector; (ii) limited access of patients to good-\nquality STI services including counseling, in both public and private health sectors; (iii) limited \nawareness, especially among high-risk groups, of STI services in the province; and (iv) irregular \nconduct of drug sensitivity tests to monitor the efficacy of drugs included under the syndromic \nmanagement protocols. \n \n4.  Reducing  the  vulnerability  of  youth  to  HIV/AIDS  through  increased  awareness  and \npractice of HIV/AIDS preventive measures is an important area not addressed in the ongoing \nproject. The province has a young population. Adolescents (10\u201319 years) make up about 20%. \nThere  is  little  awareness  among  this  group  of  what  causes  HIV/AIDS  and  how  it  can  be \nprevented.  \n \n5.  There are no plans to involve sectors other than health (e.g., police, corporate sector, \nsocial welfare) in combating the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The health department must work through \nthe Provincial AIDS Control Program with other departments, the corporate sector, labor unions, \nand  the  chamber  of  commerce  to  conceptualize  the  agenda,  develop  interventions  in  the \nworkplace, prepare a plan of action, and then train staff to carry it out. There is also no plan to \nteach a life skills\u2013based curriculum to students in private schools, universities and colleges, and \nreligious institutions and to street children. \n \n6.  An anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment and continuum care center is in the conceptual stage. \nAn  international  expert  should  be  hired  to  help  the  designated  hospital  conceptualize  the \n                                                 \n1 The 5-year, PRs234 million HIV/AIDS control program for Balochistan province is financed mainly by the World \nBank. \n ", "46  Appendix 5   \n \nprinciples of ARV treatment and continuum care and support for people infected or otherwise \naffected  by  HIV/AIDS.  According  to  the  estimates  of  the  department  of  health,  there  are  \n114 private sector blood banks in the province but only three are state-of-the art. A provincial \nblood transfusion authority (BTA) has been established; now the rule of business must be \neffectively enforced.  \n \nB.  Tuberculosis \n \n7.  Pakistan has the sixth-highest tuberculosis burden among all countries. The incidence of \ntuberculosis  is  determined  through  periodic  tuberculin  and  disease  surveys.  The  overall \nincidence of tuberculosis is 177 cases per 100,000 population, and that of sputum-positive \npulmonary tuberculosis is 80 cases per 100,000 population, according to a 1987/88 survey.  \n \n8.  As  of  2004,  the  Balochistan  department  of  health  had  extended  directly  observed \ntherapy  for  tuberculosis  (TB-DOTS)  services  to  23  out  of  27  districts  by  establishing  46 \nfunctional diagnostic and 189 treatment centers. Each functional diagnostic center is to provide \nTB-DOTS services to about 150,000 persons, on average. Its total case load would be about \n270 tuberculosis cases, including 120 sputum-positive cases. Each district has one to three \ndiagnostic centers, except Quetta district, which has five centers for its population of 879,000. \nThe  population  of  eight  districts  has  been  declared  covered  under  DOTS  with  only  one \nfunctioning diagnostic center. Case detection for all forms of tuberculosis increased from 1.15% \nin 1998 to 28% in 2004. For sputum-positive cases, the case detection rate for 2004 was 31% \nagainst a target of 70% for 2005. The case detection rate for new smear-positive cases was \nbelow 10% in seven districts in 2004. Five of these seven districts have only one functional \ndiagnostic center. The sputum conversation rate in 2004 was 88%, the treatment success rate \n81%, and the default rate 12%. The quality assurance system for sputum microscopy is not fully \nestablished to detect false-positive and false-negative sputum slides.  \n \n9.  The tuberculosis control program objectives, in line with national objectives and targets \nset by the World Health Organization (WHO), are to (i) provide DOTS coverage to the entire \npopulation of the province by 2005; (ii) successfully treat 85% of tuberculosis cases using the \nDOTS strategy and detect 70% of tuberculosis cases by 2005; and (iii) reduce prevalence and \ndeaths from tuberculosis by 50% by 2010. The target under Millennium Development Goal \n(MDG) 6 is to halt and begin to reverse the spread of TB by 2015. Two indicators for monitoring \nMDG 6 are: (i) incidence of tuberculosis per 100,000 people; and (ii) proportion of tuberculosis \ncases detected and cured under DOTS. \n \n10.  The  public  sector  health  infrastructure  comprises  40  hospitals  at  various  levels \n(teaching, district and tehsil hospitals), 71 rural health centers, 511 basic health units, 21 \ntuberculosis  centers,  and  700  other  lower-level  primary  health  care  (PHC)  facilities \n(dispensaries  and  maternal  and  child  health  centers).  Although  131  health  facilities  (39 \nhospitals, 71 rural health centers, and 21 tuberculosis centers) are potentially eligible to become \ndiagnostic  centers  for  TB-DOTS,  only  46  functional  diagnostic  centers  provide  so-called \ncoverage to the population of 23 districts. The department of health has not been able to make \neven all the tuberculosis centers function as diagnostic centers.  \n \n11.  The tuberculosis control program is fully integrated with the health-care system in the \ndistrict governments (DGs), as the health offices of the DGs are responsible for TB-DOTS \nplanning  and  implementation.  The  DGs  finance  staff  salaries  and  utility  costs  from  their \nrespective district budgets through Account IV but hardly finance any non-salary items, which \nare generally funded by the Balochistan health department from its development budget.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 5  47 \n12.  In 2003, the National Tuberculosis Control Program (NTP) received a onetime grant \nfrom the Global Drug Facility for the procurement of anti-tuberculosis drugs for a period of 2 \nyears. The drugs are shared with those DG health services where the DOTS strategy is being \nimplemented. The stocks are expected to be consumed by 2005 and the provincial government \nor the DGs will have to procure anti-tuberculosis drugs from their own budgets. The NTP has \nalso secured grant funds from Global Fund, WHO, and United States Agency for International \nDevelopment (USAID). These funds, invested at the DG level, are intended to support technical \nassistance and public-private partnerships on a limited scale, but are provided outside national, \nprovincial, and district accounts. The for-profit private sector does not take part in implementing \nthe TB-DOTS strategy; instead it uses its own protocols in treating tuberculosis cases. Two \nnongovernment organizations\u2014the Balochistan chapter of the Anti-tuberculosis Association and \nMercy Corps\u2014are implementing the TB-DOTS strategy in partnership with the public sector \nTuberculosis Control Program.  \n \n13.  The NTP has expanded over time and achieved satisfactory progress. Acceleration \nbeyond this level to maintain its 85% treatment success rate and detection rate of up to 70% of \ntuberculosis cases is a daunting task, but it must be done to reverse the spread of tuberculosis \nby 2015. The main challenges faced by the district and provincial program units are: (i) lack of \ndoctors and technicians at peripheral facilities, preventing the establishment of diagnostic and \ntreatment centers; (ii) absence of linkages between the public sector and the for-profit sector, \nand the limited involvement of the not-for-profit private sector; (iii) lack of resources to establish \nperipheral diagnostic laboratories; (iv) absence of resources to establish referral laboratories for \nquality control; (v) meager non-salary budget at the district level, both for implementation and for \nmonitoring; and (vi) geographically dispersed population, separated by long distances. \n \n14.  Options  for  expanding  the  NTP  must  be  found.  DGs  and  the  Balochistan  health \ndepartment  should  explore  the  following  interventions  by  investing  more  resources,  either \nthrough donor grants or out of their own development budgets: (i) establishing new diagnostic \ncenters in the public sector; (ii) establishing new diagnostic and treatment centers in the private \nsector; (iii) training new staff in the DOTS diagnostic and treatment protocols; (iv) establishing \nregional quality control laboratories; (v) expanding TB-DOTS in the remaining four districts; and \n(vi) establishing referral services to deal with complicated cases. \n \nC.  Malaria \n15.  Malaria has been a major public health problem in Balochistan and threatens the health \nof millions of people, especially pregnant women and children under 5 years. Rapid population \ngrowth, the influx of Afghan refugees, and haphazard urbanization, together with deteriorating \nsanitation has increased malaria incidence in Balochistan. Both Plasmodium falciparum (P.f) \nand  Plasmodium  vivax  (P.v)  types  are  widely  distributed.  The  major  vector  species  are \nAnopheles culicificies and A. stephensi. The major transmission period is from July through \nNovember, but there is also a short spring transmission during April and May. More recently \nmalaria cases have been observed throughout the year in coastal areas, and this is cause for \nconcern. \n \n16.  Balochistan province has a high incidence of malaria compared with the rest of the \ncountry.  The  annual  parasite  incidence  (API)  measures  the  number  of  cases  per  1,000 \npopulation occurring in a year. The overall API for the country was 0.73 per 1,000 in 2001 and \n0.21 per 1,000 in 2004. In Balochistan, API was 9.93, 8.79, 6.69, 7.95, and 6.56 per 1,000 \nbetween 2000 and 2004. A total of 40,730 confirmed cases (32% of all malaria cases in \nPakistan) were detected in the province by the public sector in 2004. Since about 25% of the \npopulation uses public sector health facilities, the total number of malaria cases should be at \n ", "48  Appendix 5   \n \nleast four times higher. Therefore, by conservative estimates, about 163,000 cases may occur \nevery year at an API of 6.56 per 1,000\u2500a very high morbidity level. In 2004, 35% in Balochistan \nand 26% nationwide had P.f malaria. P.f malaria is generally prevalent in coastal areas, causes \nmany deaths in children and results in low-birth-weight babies. In the following 11 high-risk \ndistricts in the province API has remained quite high in 2002-2003: Kech, Panjgur, Kharan, \nLoralai, Chagai, Ziarat, Zhob, Gawadar, Sibbi, and Jaffarabad. \n \n17.  P.f malaria has become resistant to chloroquine throughout the country. Resistance  \nlevel I (RI) is common (30\u201384%), RII resistance is rare (2\u201336%), while resistance level III (RIII) \nhas not yet been detected. The upsurge of P. falciparum in Balochistan could be partly due to \nthe increase in resistance to chloroquine. Vector resistance to insecticides has been one of the \nmajor  technical  problems.  Both  malaria  vectors,  i.e.,  A.  culicifacies  and  A.  stephensi,  are \nresistant to organochlorines (DDT, Dieldrin, and BHC). Recently A. stephensi has also become \nresistant to Malathion (organophosphate). The Malaria Control Program now uses Deltamethrin \n(a synthetic pyrethroid) for selective residual indoor spraying to contain focal epidemics. \n \n18.  The objective of the Malaria Control Program, in line with the national objective and \ntargets set by WHO for its Rollback Malaria (RBM) program, is to reduce malaria morbidity by \n50% by 2010. The target under MDG 6 is to halt and begin to reverse the spread of malaria by \n2015. Two indicators for monitoring MDG 6 are: (i) prevalence and death rates associated with \nmalaria; and (ii) proportion of the population in malaria risk areas that uses effective malaria \nprevention and treatment measures. Three strategies used by the Pakistan Ministry of Health \nand the department of health of Balochistan to reduce malaria morbidity by 50% by 2010 are: \n(i) strengthening preventive, diagnostic, curative, and surveillance services under the devolved \nsystem; (ii) implementing integrated vector control with the participation of the public and private \nsectors  and  communities;  and  (iii)  increasing  community  awareness  through  appropriate \nmeasures.  \n \n19.  The challenges and gaps in the Balochistan Malaria Control Program are as follows: \n(i) outdated monitoring tools, which were developed in the 1960s and are no longer relevant to \nthe RBM strategy; (ii) poorly defined roles and responsibilities at the provincial and district levels \nin the implementation of the RBM strategy in a devolved setting; (iii) high vacancy rate for many \nyears among sanctioned posts for field workers; (iv) major funding gaps in community advocacy \nand  mobilization  for  early  diagnosis  and  prevention,  public-private  partnerships  in  early \ndiagnosis and prompt treatment, urban malaria prevention and treatment, in-service training of \nhealth staff (including lady health volunteers) in RBM concepts, provincial and district monitoring \nand supervision, development of peripheral diagnostic facilities in eight districts, preventive \ninterventions (like insecticide-treated bed nets) for high-risk malaria districts, periodic preventive \ntreatment, and community treatment of children under 5 years; and (v) low awareness among \nthe district governments of their financial obligations following devolution, including the funding \nof RBM interventions. \n ", "  Appendix 6  49 \nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION MATRIX \n \nAsian Development Bank  Other Multilateral Agencies  Bilateral Agencies \nProvide assistance to  United Nations Development  Royal Netherlands Embassy: \ngovernment in its reform agenda  Program (UNDP): Fund area  Provide funding for the World \nto improve governance across  development programs in eight  Conservation Union Balochistan \nthe board, including management  districts of Balochistan:  for 4 years; its main focus is on \nof development process, public  Laralai/Musa Khel, Kalat, Killa  environment protection and water. \nresources, and expenditure;  Saifullah, Khuzdar, Mustung,  Provide support and fund projects \ntransparency and accountability  Pishin, Quetta, and Ziarat.

Introduction.  Within  the  framework  of  the  Balochistan  Performance  Grant  Rules \n(BPGR) 2005, performance grants under the Balochistan Devolved Social Services Program \n(BDSSP) will be allocated to district governments (DGs) as non-matching grants to achieve \nprogress toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in education, health, and water \nsupply and sanitation (WSS) and the goals stated in the Balochistan Poverty Reduction Strategy \nPaper (BPRSP).1 \n \n2.  Administration Process. The performance grants will be administered according to the \nprocedure defined in BPGR 2005; salient features are as follows: (i) public announcement and \nnotification by the government of Balochistan; (ii) circulation of the eligibility criteria and contract \nconditions to DGs by the provincial finance commission (PFC) secretariat; (iii) transmission of \neligibility  certificates  and  documents  from  DGs  to  the  PFC  secretariat;  (iv)  review  of  DG \ndocuments by the PFC secretariat to check for eligibility and completeness of requirements;  \n(v) submission by DGs of any information needed to complete the requirements; (vi) preparation \nof list of eligible DGs, and issuance of invitation to DGs to complete contractual formalities;  \n(vii) completion of contractual formalities; (viii) DG submission of monthly expenditure reports \nand quarterly progress reports to PFC; and (ix) monitoring by provincial governments through \nsector line departments. \n \n3.  Distribution  Formula.  The  counterpart  program  funds  generated  from  Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) loan ($65 million) and the ADF grant for the control of HIV/AIDS and \ninfectious diseases ($5 million) will be allocated among all eligible DGs as performance grants \naccording to a formula established by the PFC.2 \n \n4.  Sector Allocations. The performance grants allocated to the DGs will be used for three \nsectors: education, health, and WSS. To conform to national and provincial priorities and ensure \naccurate monitoring, the use of the performance grants will be restricted to the funding areas \nindicated in Table A9, which may be further expanded by the program steering committee. To \nprovide flexibility for local needs and ensure sectoral balance, each of the three sectors must be \nallocated at least 20%. The remaining 40% of the DG allocation may be used at their discretion \nin the three social sectors. This would enable them to adopt more effective, demand-driven, and \nparticipatory planning processes to identify service gaps and rationalize and develop services \nwith full ownership.  \n \n5.  ADF  Grant  for  Human  Immunodeficiency  Virus/Acquired  Immunodeficiency \nSyndrome (HIV/AIDS) and Infectious Diseases Control. The counterpart funds generated \nfrom  the  $5  million  ADF  grant  for  HIV/AIDS  and  infectious  diseases  control  will  be  used \nexclusively  to  support  components  in  health  sector  that  relate  to  HIV/AIDS,  malaria, \ntuberculosis, and childhood infectious diseases control (component 07B of health sector).The \nspecific components that would be financed by this grant are as follows: \n \n(i)  Increase awareness of HIV/AIDS and measures to control its spread, including \ninterventions to increase knowledge and measures to prevent HIV/AIDS among \ngeneral  public,  especially  illiterates;  identification  and  counseling  of  high-risk \ngroups  to  change  high-risk  behavior;  measures  to  prevent  spread,  including \ndistribution of condoms; and treatment support for sexually transmitted infections. \n                                                 \n1  See Supplementary Appendix Q for the Balochistan Performance Grant Rules 2005. \n2 The current allocation formula is based on the fiscal needs of DGs: 50% of the funds are allocated on the basis of \npopulation, and the remaining 50% on the basis of area.  \n \n ", "          Appendix 9  59 \n  Table A9: Performance Grant Funding Areas \n Category  Funding Areas \nA.

Fund Disbursements, Monitoring, Reporting, and Audit. The performance grants \nunder BDSSP will be disbursed from the government of Balochistan to DGs at one time as an \nadvance or in quarterly instalments according to BPGR. All funds will be transferred to the \nrelevant DGs though Account IV. The performance grants will be monitored principally through \nthe  mechanisms  and  systems  specified  in  the  BPGR,  as  follows:  (i)  annual  monitoring  of \nallocations/program/work by the relevant provincial sector department; (ii) monitoring by the \nrelevant offices and monitoring committees of DGs; and (iii) special monitoring by the finance \ndepartment when progress in the quarterly progress reports is unsatisfactory (Figure A9). The \nADF grant\u2013financed HIV/AIDS and infectious diseases control component will be monitored as \na separate component to track grant effectiveness. The grant outputs and outcomes will be \ncarefully monitored through the routine reporting mechanisms of the program loan and through \npublic expenditure tracking surveys and quantitative service delivery surveys. \n \n7.  BDSSP shall: (i) through the program units (PUs) in the DGs, review the reports of the \nmonitoring committees of the union level; and (ii) through the PU in the finance department, \nreview the reports of the monitoring committees of the district councils with regard to schemes \nand initiatives receiving performance grants. In addition, the government of Balochistan plans to \nintroduce the following: (i) a public expenditure tracking survey (PETS); (ii) a quantitative service \ndelivery survey (QSDS); and (iii) a citizen report card, which will be implemented on a pilot basis \nto obtain public perceptions of the quality of service delivery. BDSSP will provide technical \nassistance in developing and implementing these mechanisms (see Supplementary Appendix \nR). DGs are required to facilitate these surveys under the terms of their partnership agreement \nwith the provincial government. The BDSSP provincial program office will be responsible for \noperationalizing BDSSP assistance and support through contracted assignments including third-\nparty assessments/validation through contracted NGOs. The survey reports and third-party \nassessments/validation will be used by the provincial PU and provincial program office, along \nwith financial and implementation progress reports, to evaluate outputs and impacts. \n \n8.  Reports include those: (i) To be submitted by DGs: a monthly financial report along with \ndetailed  expenditure  statements  for  each  category  of  grant,  to  be  submitted  to  the  PFC \nsecretariat and the finance department; a quarterly progress report on the financial position, \nprogress on implementation, and detailed expenditure statement for each category of grant, to \nbe submitted to the PFC secretariat; and an annual progress report to be submitted to the PFC \nsecretariat  and  the  provincial  finance  department;  and  (ii)  To  be  submitted  by  the  PFC \nsecretariat: all reports submitted by DGs, consolidated into a database and as an annual report \non PGs, and published for each financial year.

Tehsil Municipal Administration. Tehsil municipal administrations have the statutory \nmandate for land-use planning and management, enforcement of municipal regulations, delivery \nof municipal services (water supply, sanitation, roads and streets, street lighting). Selected tehsil \nmunicipal administrations will, subject to rules: qualify for BDSSP performance grants; use the \ngrants according to specific criteria and conditions defined for BDSSP and follow the procedures \nlaid down in the monitoring, accounting, and reporting rules and the specific terms of the \npartnership;  ensure  transparency,  equity,  and  accountability  in  the  participatory  planning, \nallocation,  and  use  of  the  grants;  and  encourage  and  facilitate  citizen  participation  and \ninvolvement and public-private partnership in planning, monitoring, and implementing service \ndelivery. \n \n5.  Council  and  Committee  Level.  Table  A10.2  provides  details  of  the  roles  and \nresponsibilities of various existing committees and new arrangements proposed at council and \ncommunity level in the Program.  \n \nTable A10.2: Roles and Responsibilities of Different Committees/Boards at Council and \nCommunity Level \n \nLevel  Roles and Responsibilities \nA. Council  The councils are required to endorse the applications for performance grants and approve the \nand  expenditure reports submitted to the provincial finance department. The councils have the statutory \nCommittees  mandate to approve district government/ tehsil municipal administration budgets and monitor their \nperformance. Under the rules, BDSSP will, through the provincial program office, liase and establish \nlinkages  with initiatives for the strengthening and capacity building of elected institutions and \nfunctionaries, particularly women and labor/ peasant representatives.  \nThe monitoring committees of the councils have the mandate to monitor and submit quarterly reports \nto the councils to contain an evaluation of performance in relation to achievement of targets; \nresponsiveness to citizen difficulties; efficiency in delivery of services; and transparent functioning \nand may require the respective nazim to take action. Further, the committees may recommend \nbonus or performance pay to government functionaries in recognition of their efficient performance \n(subject to availability of funds for this purpose), and identify inefficiency or corruption and require \nthe nazim concerned to take appropriate action and remedial measures, regarding which the nazim\nhas to report the action taken to the council within 30 days. BDSSP shall, through the provincial \nprogram office, liase and establish linkages with initiatives to make monitoring committees more \neffective. \nBDSSP shall, through the program unit in the finance department, review the reports of the \nmonitoring committees of the zila and tehsil council with regard to matters relating to the schemes \nand initiatives receiving BDSSP performance grants. \nBDSSP shall, through the program units in the district government, review the reports of the \nmonitoring committee at the union level. In addition, the union administration and elected union \nfunctionaries shall be consulted during the QSDS, PETS, and third-party validation. \nThe accounts committees of the councils are required under the rules to ensure that public funds are \nused as planned and after public hearings submit their reports to the council. BDSSP shall utilize the \nreports of the accounts committee of the zilacouncil to review transparency and accountability in the \nuse of performance grant funds. \nB. School  SMCs or parent-teacher school management committees (PTSMCs) are being revived under the \nManagement  education sector reform program and being provided funds and capacity-building support. BDSSP \nCommittee  will expand support to SMCs in two ways. First, BDSSP will assist the provincial government in \n(SMCs)  announcing an agreed policy framework (i) increasing the participation of communities to improve \nschool operation and maintenance, including purchase of textbooks and school supplies, repairs and \n ", "              Appendix 10    65\nLevel  Roles and Responsibilities \nmaintenance, provision of basic facilities and furniture, and contracting of female teachers on school-\nspecific contracts; and (ii) allocation formula (PRs/pupil) and limits for procurement (PRs/contract), \nprocess of transferring funds to SMCs, and instruction and guidelines for SMCs including accounting \nand auditing. Second, district governments will be assisted in implementing the framework through \nBDSSP performance grants to fund SMCs and to provide capacity-building support (other than to \nthose supported under ESRA). Further, BDSSP may, at a later stage, consider expanding SMC \nsupport coverage to all schools/intermediate colleges (up to class 12). \nC. District/  Hospital boards and patient welfare associations can play an important role in improving efficiency, \nTehsil  quality, governance, and accountability. BDSSP will assist (i) in defining the framework for the \nHospital  functioning of hospital boards in district/tehsil hospitals, and (ii) provide performance grants to district \nBoards  governments to operationalize the boards to improve hospital services, maintenance and repairs, \nprocurement of equipment and supplies, and provide incentives and facilities for female staff. \nBDSSP will assist the provincial government in developing the framework and pilot a model of \nautonomy for the four provincial government health institutions, considering possible legislation and \nrules of business defining the role, functions, and modalities of the board and its committees. (In \nPunjab, hospital boards for teaching hospitals were established under provincial legislation. A third-\nparty evaluation showed visible improvement in outpatient, emergency, and laboratory services, \nutilization of hospital beds (by 90% in one case) and equipment.) \nD. Citizen  The Balochistan Local Government Ordinance 2001 envisages that the CCBs will work with local \nCommunity  governments (LGs) to mobilize the community and stakeholders to improve existing facilities and \nBoards  services, develop new public facilities, increase access of vulnerable groups to income opportunities, \n(CCBs)  public services, and welfare programs; and for this purpose LGs are required under the law to set\naside 25% of their development budget for CCB activities. A number of government and foreign-\nassisted programs, national and international organizations are providing support in the formation \nand capacity building of CCBs. BDSSP will, through the provincial program office, work in close \ncollaboration with ongoing initiatives, in particular the Decentralization Support Program  and the \nUnited Nations Development Program\u2013supported Devolution Trust for Community Empowerment. \nBDSSP performance grants will be provided for CCB activities to the district government in the \neducation and health sectors and to selected tehsil municipal administrations for water supply and \nsanitation sectors. \nE. Local  BDSSP performance grants to district governments and tehsil municipal administrations to promote \nNGOs/ CBOs   grassroots (community) participation and public-private partnership in service delivery may be used \nto fund involvement of local NGOs/CBOs in these activities and, where the local NGO/CBO demands\nit, to facilitate their registration and functioning as CCBs. \nF. Existing  Water user committees for rural water supply schemes were established under various foreign-\nVillage/Water  assisted projects and by the public health engineering department under the Social Action Program \nCommittees  framework in the 1990s. Some committees are still active but others have been inactive and many \nschemes  are  non-functional:  schemes  can  be  sustained  and  maintained  by  the \ncommittees/communities only if they are demand-based, the community contributes to the project \ncost and participates in its implementation. BDSSP will assist district governments/tehsil municipal \nadministrations in sustaining such water committees as are still functioning. \nG. Water and  BDSSP performance grants will facilitate the formation of village and mohalla-based citizens\u2019groups \nSanitation  for sustainable community management, operation and maintenance of water supply and sanitation,\nCommittees  particularly for solid waste in urban areas at the local level in partnership with the LGs concerned \neither as water and sanitation committees or as CCBs. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, BDSSP = Balochistan Devolved Social Services Program, CBO = community\u2013\nbased organization, CCB = citizen community board, ESRA = education sector reform assistance, LG = local \ngovernment, PETS = public expenditure tracking survey, PRs = Pakistan rupees, PTSMCs = parent teacher school \nmanagement committee, QSDS = quantitative service delivery survey, SMC = school management committee. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n ", "66  Appendix 11   \n \nINELIGIBLE ITEMS \n \n1.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?        No  priority in country poverty partnership    No \n  agreement?   \nContribution of the sectors\u2014education, health, water supply sanitation (WSS)\u2014to the reduction of poverty in \nBalochistan, Pakistan: Geographically, Balochistan is Pakistan\u2019s largest province. Two thirds of its population of 6.5 \nmillion resides in rural areas comprising scattered settlements of sparse populations. The population is ethnically \ndiverse, consisting, among others, of Balochi and Pushto speakers. Agriculture is the main source of income for the rural \npopulation, employing 65% of the total labor force and yielding 60% of the gross provincial domestic product. However, \nonly a third of the land area is productive for agricultural or grazing purposes. Half the productive land area is owned by \n10% of large farmers while most tenants work on small farms with incomes below the poverty line. Agricultural \nproduction and livestock rearing have been seriously damaged by the drought that has prevailed in the province in the \nlast 5 years. Poverty in Balochistan increased from an estimated 28.6% in 1993 to 38.4% in 1997. In 2003, the provincial \ngovernment estimated poverty levels at between 41.3% and 47%. Rural poverty is much greater than urban poverty. The \nsocial  sector  indicators  for  Balochistan  (health,  education,  and  WSS)  also  show  that  the  province  faces  acute \ndeprivation. \n \nThe Balochistan Provincial Poverty Strategy (BPRS) 2003 and the local government system (implemented in 2001) are \naimed at facilitating poverty reduction, addressing local needs, and improving public service delivery systems. BPRS is \ngeared toward: (i) engendering growth, (ii) managing the scarce water resources, (iii) introducing governance reforms, \n(iv) improving human development, and (v) addressing vulnerability to shocks. The local government system has placed \nlocal administration under an elected nazim and aims to prioritize in accordance with local needs and to facilitate better \nservice delivery. However, while public service delivery systems have improved in some districts, in general the \nfunctioning of local governments continues to be hampered by incomplete transfer of power and resources, overlapping \nof functions and friction between provincial and local governments as well as between different tiers of local government, \nand  institutional  capacity  gaps.  The  poverty  partnership  between  the  Government  of  Pakistan  and  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) reflects the Government\u2019s vision for poverty reduction, including the need to improve access \nto and quality of social services for the poor. The Government has agreed that poverty reduction requires good \ngovernance, increased allocation of funds for social sectors, and improved basic social services to enhance human \ndevelopment. ADB supports the Government\u2019s governance reforms through the Decentralization Support Program \n(DSP) and other projects. The Balochistan Devolved Social Services Program (BDSSP) has strong linkages with the \nBalochistan Resource Management Program (BRMP), and supports the aims of the BPRS and the implementation of \nthe local government system. \nB.        Poverty Analysis                                 Targeting Classification: Targeted interventions \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nThe \u201cperceptions of poverty\u201d among the poor in Balochistan also go beyond the economic aspect to include political, \ncultural, and institutional dimensions. Poverty in Balochistan also has a distinct spatial dimension, with 24 of its 27 \ndistricts, consisting of 92% of its population, falling under the category of regions of \u201chigh\u201d deprivation. Poor households \nin Balochistan are characterized by low levels of education, poor health, and absence of safe drinking water and \nsanitation facilities. Overall, more than half of the total population, of which 78% is female, has never attended school \nbecause of poverty, social constraints, inaccessibility of schools, lack of basic amenities in educational institutions, and \npoor  quality  of  education  (poor  teaching  methods,  teacher  absenteeism,  etc.).  The  health  indicators  show  that \nmalnutrition is rampant among children. Infant and child mortality rates are high, especially among poor households in \nrural areas, and nearly one tenth of infants die before the age of 1 year mainly because of diarrhoeal diseases, perinatal \ndiseases, and pneumonia. Immunization coverage is also low.  \n \nA very small minority of rural households have access to piped water inside or outside the house. Sixty-three percent of \nthe total population, and 72% of the rural population is dependent on unprotected sources for their drinking water. Only \nabout a third of the rural population has access to excreta disposal facilities while a negligible proportion has access to a \nsewerage system. Solid waste collection and disposal service is not available to the rural population while only less than \na third of the urban population has access to this facility. Poverty in Balochistan is also exacerbated by governance \nissues such as strained federal-provincial relations, leading to a general perception of discrimination, neglect, and denial \nof rights; prevalence of a strengthened tribal system that perpetuates the denial of political and fundamental democratic \nrights (especially for women and the poor) and the subjugation of the populace through inordinate influence on the \nsystem of justice and law enforcement agents; lack of adequate public resources and weak governmental management \nsystems; low level of public safety and deteriorating law and order situation, leading to an increased sense of insecurity; \nand the existence of multiple systems of justice, which diminishes the quality of justice available and creates problems \nfor those seeking redressal. \n \n ", "                   Appendix 13    69\nDuring the 1990s, the government implemented the Social Action Program to improve the management and delivery of \nsocial services. However, this program had very limited success because of lack of political commitment to reforms and \npolicies, poor governance, and lack of community involvement.  \n \nThe goal of BDSSP is to aid Balochistan\u2019s progress toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in health, \neducation, and WSS. Its objectives are to increase access to affordable, effective, and quality social services  in both \npublic and private sectors; reduce disparities in access to services on the basis of gender, ethnicity, income group, and \nregional affiliation; and ensure that strengthened local governments, private sector, and communities improve social \nservice delivery. To this end, BDSSP will implement policy reforms and fund local governments to improve service \ndelivery and build institutional capacity. The areas of policy reforms include: (i) provincial efficiency incentives\u2014to clarify \nthe relationship between provincial and local governments, (ii) managerial power\u2014to strengthen relationship between \nlocal governments and social service providers, (iii) citizens\u2019 voice and empowerment\u2014to involve citizens in policy \nmaking and management of social sector facilities, and (iv) private sector engagement. BDSSP will employ the systems \nof \u201cefficient resource management\u201d and allocation of performance grants (developed under BRMP) to local governments \nto ensure the financial sustainability of reforms and to secure the delivery of social services (focusing on the needs of the \nmost vulnerable) on a sustainable basis.  \n \nBDSSP interventions will be low cost and high impact and will strengthen progress toward the poverty reduction and \nhuman development targets laid out in the BPRS. Sector strategies will be implemented for health and education (within \nthe national and provincial policy framework) and for improvements in sanitation (with the civil society and NGOs). \nInterventions to improve education sector targets and quality of and access to education include refurbishing school \nbuildings; upgrading schools (from primary to middle and from middle to high school); providing scholarships for \ndeserving  students;  providing  free  textbooks  in  primary  schools;  improving  teaching  methods/learning  materials; \nproviding financial support for maintenance and consumables; and forming and strengthening parent teacher school \nmanagement committees (PTSMCs). Improvements in health sector targets and in quality of and access to health \nservices will be achieved by implementing interventions for the uplift of district hospitals; addressing the residential \naccommodation needs of hospital and rural health staff; providing grants for the training of local residents and the \nestablishment of private practice for private paramedics, dispensers etc.; developing and implementing a hospital \nemergency services plan; and sustaining district hospital boards. The problem of inadequate staff, in both health and \neducation facilities, will be addressed by instituting a system of facility-specific non-regularizable contract appointments. \nBDSSP will also involve the private sector and promote public-private partnerships to enhance public service delivery. \nInterventions include developing alternative options for health service delivery in sparsely populated areas; developing \ninnovative teaching materials and mother-tongue-based teaching learning materials; and launching a strategy for self-\nregulation of the private sector in health and education. Measures to ensure implementation and staff capacity building \ninclude strengthening of monitoring systems; civil society and third-party monitoring; performance awards for staff and \nservice delivery facilities; training of trainers to form a core group of master trainers at the district level for teacher \ntraining; training of school supervisors; training of head teachers in school management; strengthening of paramedical \nand nursing training schools outside Quetta; and in-service training for health providers.  \n \nC.        Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nA cross-section of stakeholders, including elected representatives of local governments, officials of provincial and local \ngovernment departments, service providers and, representatives of civil society organizations participated in 13 district, \n4 regional, and 1 province-level workshops. Discussions focused on areas of policy reforms and concerns and priorities \nrelated to delivery of social services, with special focus on the needs of women and the poor. The grassroots perspective \nwas also gathered through a series of focus group discussions with communities and frontline service providers, \nparticularly women. \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nBDSSP  provides  TA  support  to  develop  and  institute  grievance  redressal  mechanisms  in  provincial  and  local \ngovernments  at  the  service  delivery  level.  Additionally,  local  governments  are  obliged  to  provide  25%  of  their \ndevelopment funds to support citizen community boards to facilitate participation of communities in local government \nplanning and service delivery activities. BDSSP will develop a communication strategy to promote and strengthen \ncommunity involvement in the management of service facilities and to support implementation of BDSSP in general. \nBDSSP will prepare a program of civil society monitoring to look at the various local government monitoring mechanisms \nfor citizen oversight including piloting a system of citizen reports cards in the city district of Quetta. The TA under BDSSP \nwill provide capacity development, among others, to local NGOs, CBOs, and community groups to promote community \nmanagement of facilities. \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: Balochistan\u2019s social sector indicators highlight the high level of gender \ninequality: the net primary school enrollment rate is 20% for girls and 28% for boys; the literacy rate is 16% for females \nand 39% for males; maternal mortality figures are high; and, a very small number of deliveries, especially in rural areas, \n ", "70  Appendix 13   \n \nare handled by skilled birth attendants. Women\u2019s inferior status continues to be perpetuated because of curtailed \nmobility; prevalence of discriminatory tribal and cultural practices, limited voice in critical household decision making; and \nmarginalization along the political dimension. The government of Balochistan is committed to reforming its policies, \nsystems, procedures, and administrative structures to promote gender equality in accordance with its national and \ninternational commitments. The gender reform agenda of the government is articulated in a Gender Reform Action Plan \n(GRAP), which was approved by the Balochistan cabinet in July 2004. The goal of Balochistan GRAP is to bring about \nchanges in the structure and process of government to promote gender equity, and deliver on the rights and entitlements \nof women. Gender mainstreaming is the key strategy for realizing this goal. Initiatives such as the Gender Reform Action \nPlan (GRAP), DSP, BRMP, and BDSSP aim to enhance women\u2019s access to public sector services and to strengthen \ntheir active participation in public sector management, and political and economic activities. BDSSP aims to reduce \ngender disparities in the quality of and access to public services by paying special attention to the needs of girls and \nwomen while implementing and monitoring interventions. While most interventions will also benefit women, some will \nspecifically aim to reduce gender disparities. \n Has an output been prepared?      Yes     No \nGender Action Plan: Each of the provincial education, health, and public health engineering departments will develop, \nin consultation with district governments, a sector strategy in their respective sectors, which will address increased \naccess to basic social services for the poor and for women in particular. Expenditure allocation norms will be established \nin line with minimum standards for social sectors that will have direct benefit for women. To enhance the effectiveness \nand efficient of service provision, incentive systems will be developed for sector managers and service delivery staff, \nincluding residential benefits for female staff.  \n (i)  Education. Interventions to improve girls' access to education will include equipping girl schools with basic facilities, \nsuch as boundary walls, drinking water, and toilet/latrines, and providing merit scholarships for girls with primary \neducation to do their matriculation and for matriculate girls to continue intermediate level education.  \n(ii)  Health. Women\u2019s access to health care will be improved by interventions to provide residential accommodation for \nfemale service providers (nurses and lady health volunteers (LHVs)) in district and tehsil hospitals to ensure their \npresence in health facilities, and provide financial support for the training of midwives and LHVs and for the setting \nup of private practice for those working privately so that the reproductive health-care needs of women are \nadequately addressed. Such capacity building initiatives will also improve the quality of health care available to \nfemales. \n(iii)  Capacity Building. Grants will also be given for the capacity building of female elected representatives to \nstrengthen their participation in PTSMCs and monitoring committees of union councils. This will ensure their active \ninvolvement in the management and monitoring of public service facilities. \n(iv)  Program Implementation and Monitoring. Preference will be given to qualified female for all program-specific \nstaff positions. Consistent with all of the policy reform and project activities aimed at promoting gender equality and \nthe empowerment of women in Balochistan, adequate representation of women would be ensured in: program \nsteering Committee, provincial program office, program committee, and program units. Gender-disaggregated data \nwould be collected through public expenditure tracking surveys and quantitative service delivery surveys to monitor \nand evaluate the effectiveness of the gender action plan, among other things.  \nE.
