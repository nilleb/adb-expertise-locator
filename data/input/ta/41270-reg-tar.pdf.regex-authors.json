INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This research and development technical assistance (TA)1 will study the rationale for the \ndevelopment  of  a  sustainable  fuel  partnership  (the  Partnership)  in  Asia.  The  proposed \npartnership will be implemented as part of the new Sustainable Transport Initiative of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB),2 which aims to develop a pipeline of sustainable transport projects \nacross Asia and the Pacific. The partnership will seek to bring together a number of different \nstakeholders, including intergovernmental organizations, national and local governments, civil \nsociety, think tanks, and funding organizations, with the goal of helping developing member \ncountries (DMCs) better manage their future demand for oil. This, in turn, can help contribute to \nenergy security and stability in the region. \n \n2.  A common understanding of the term \"energy security\" is maintaining necessary access \nto energy resources without risking a state\u2019s current and future survival. The world has entered \ninto a vicious cycle in which the need to secure energy supplies to fuel economic growth is \nmotivating  countries  to  more  aggressively  secure  their  interests  in  energy  resources  and \nsupplies, thereby elevating political tensions.  \n \n3.  To help improve energy security in the region, this TA will explore an innovative idea\u2014to \ntreat energy security as a public good that can be valued and translated into cash flow, thereby \nhelping  to  correct  market  deficiencies.  More  specifically,  it  will  explore  the  feasibility  of \nestablishing  a  market-based  mechanism  to  monetize  the  contribution  of  oil  consumption \nmanagement measures to energy security.  \n \n4.  Although all fossil fuels are highly relevant from the perspective of energy security and \neconomic growth, the initial focus will be on oil, for two reasons. First, unlike natural gas and \ncoal\u2014which are largely traded regionally\u2014oil is traded globally, and with high liquidity. This \nmeans that if one country avoids consuming a barrel of oil, the impact on global supply-demand \nfundamentals is roughly equivalent to an equal reduction elsewhere in the world. Second, the \nestimated reserves of oil are far smaller than are reserves of natural gas or coal,3 and therefore \nsecuring oil is the primary energy security concern of most nations at present.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \nA.  Oil Consumption Trends and Risks  \n \n5.  In response to expected high rates of economic growth, oil demand in Asia and the \nPacific is projected to increase significantly. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), \ndeveloping Asian economies are expected to account for over 70% of the total world increase in \noil use between 2007 and 2030,5 significantly impacting global oil demand. The United States \nEnergy Information Administration (EIA) projects that the Asia and Pacific region6 will overtake \nNorth America as the largest liquids-consuming region by as early as 2010.7 \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 19 March 2008. \n2  A white paper is currently being prepared for this initiative. \n3  Not including recoverable oil from unconventional sources, such as oil sands and oil shale, which involve more \ncostly and energy-intensive procedures for extraction than traditional reserves. \n4  The proposed partnership could eventually be extended to include options that manage natural gas and coal once \nglobal supply-demand balance becomes tight for these resources.  \n5  IEA. 2008.

Washington, DC: US Department of Energy.  \n ", "2   \n6.  Contributing to this situation, the majority of cities in Asia and the Pacific are following \nthe past trend in many developed countries by becoming increasingly dependent on resource-\nintensive private transportation. Around three-quarters of the world\u2019s incremental oil demand is \nprojected to come from the transportation sector (footnote 5), with a large proportion of this due \nto the rapid increase in vehicle ownership in Asia. Given a \"business-as-usual\" (BAU) scenario, \nthe total number of personal vehicles in the People's Republic of China and India combined \ncould rise from 19 million in 2005 to 215 million by 2030.8 EIA projects that developing Asian \neconomies will consume approximately 34.5% of the world\u2019s transportation liquids in 2030, up \nfrom 12.6% in 2005 (footnote 7). \n \n7.  Such a heavy dependence on fossil fuels, and especially oil, exposes countries to price \nand  supply  fluctuations  that  can  undermine  their  economic  stability.  The  lack  of  a  readily \navailable substitute for oil at the scale required results in very low price elasticity. Small supply \ndisruptions can consequently lead to large changes in price. Oil prices have already proven to \nbe highly volatile. The price of crude oil climbed from $25 per barrel in 2002 to above $60 per \nbarrel in early 2007 and peaked at over $140 in July 2008. Although prices have now declined \nto around $60\u2013$70 per barrel, primarily due to the global economic downturn, the long-term rise \nin demand dictates that there will be sustained upward pressure on oil prices, as well as short-\nterm price volatility.  \n \nB.  Vulnerabilities of the Asia and Pacific Region \n \n8.  The Asia and Pacific region is particularly vulnerable to price shocks, as the majority of \nits countries are net oil importers with high oil intensity (i.e., oil consumed per unit of gross \ndomestic product). The region produces a mere 9% of the world\u2019s crude oil supply, while \nconsuming about 26%.9 The rise in oil prices has affected the fiscal standing of countries that \nimport substantial quantities of oil and offer subsidies to consumers. Such countries are less \nable to weather the financial turmoil wrought by higher oil-import costs.  \n \n9.  Oil price spikes also have far-reaching effects on livelihoods. By increasing the costs of \nfertilizers,  food  processing,  and  transport  of  goods,  rising  oil  prices  in  2007\u20132008  caused \nvarious commodity prices to increase. In turn, surging staple crop prices across Asia sparked \nfears of a global food crisis and posed the risk of social unrest. The poor, who already spend a \nsignificant portion of their revenue on food and fuel, are the most affected by such events.  \n \n10.  Oil-exporting countries are also exposed to risk. According to a recent report published \nby Chatham House, if the economies of oil-exporting countries \"are to continue to grow and \navoid long-term decline, oil tax revenues and foreign exchange earnings from hydrocarbon \nexports will need to be replaced by developing the non-hydrocarbon economy.\"10 Thus, it is of \ngreat concern to see oil-producing countries pressured into boosting supply when their reserves \nare known and finite. More stable and predictable oil prices associated with more balanced \ndemand (and greater price elasticity) would help facilitate a gradual transition. The price spikes \nof the kind experienced in 2008 only serve to raise geopolitical tensions. \n \n                                                 \n8  ADB and the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom, in collaboration with the Clean Air \nInitiative for Asian Cities. 2006.

Market  incentives,  appropriate  public  policies,  and  new  technologies,  along  with \ninternational efforts to manage fossil fuel demand on an equitable and sensible basis, will \nenable the world to experience a more gradual\u2014and peaceful\u2014transition.  These efforts would \nin  turn  contribute  to  more  sustainable  global  economic  growth,  regional  stability,  and \nenvironmental integrity.    \n \nC.  Proposed Mechanism \n \n12.  This TA will explore a new market scheme to address the challenges discussed above. \nBy focusing on Asia, where the largest growth in oil consumption is expected, the market could \ncontribute to a significant diversion from BAU consumption growth patterns and enhance oil \nprice elasticity. More specifically, the TA will explore the creation of a new commodity\u2014fuel \nsecurity credits (FSCs)\u2014that would monetize the contribution of oil consumption management \nmeasures to energy security. Through trading of this new commodity, DMCs could access \nadditional funds to implement alternative policies, technologies, systems, and fuels that would \notherwise not be financially attractive. Large oil consumers will reap savings from more stable \noil prices if the market mechanism is effective, and will thus be willing to purchase FSCs.  \n \n13.  In exploring how to create a market for FSCs, the TA will look closely at past successful \ninitiatives. The market concept itself is not a new one. It builds on the fundamentals and \nexperience of trading public goods, such as the reduction of local air pollutants and greenhouse \ngases (GHGs), \"green certificates\" for renewable electricity, and \"white certificates\" for energy \nefficiency improvements. One unique feature of the proposed fuel security market is that it will \nfocus on governments as agents of change. This is in contrast to the carbon market, which \napplies a project-based approach, or green certificates (in the United States and Australia), \nwhich  are  centered  on  utilities.  To  develop  a  proposed  structure  for  the  market,  multiple \ndialogues  will  be  held  under  this  TA  with  (i)  national  governments,  which  set  regulatory \nframeworks such as building codes and national fuel policies; and (ii) local governments, which \nmake key decisions on energy-transport infrastructure development and management. \n \n14.  The partnership will also consider the adoption of voluntary \"smart targets,\" which will \ninvolve setting quantitative goals to reduce oil intensity. However, FSCs may initially be traded \nover the counter in the absence of any voluntary or mandatory framework. For example, the first \ncarbon offset trade was in 1989, well before the Kyoto Protocol defined the Clean Development \nMechanism as a supplementary compliance mechanism in 1997.  \n \n15.  The initiative will also have significant additional benefits (or so-called \"co-benefits\"), \nsuch  as  GHG  reduction  and  improved  local  air  quality.  These  will  be  secondary  benefits, \nhowever.  The  proposed  market  does  not  seek  to  replicate  or  replace  the  carbon  market. \nInstead,  by  creating  a  different  public  good\u2014energy  security\u2014this  market  could  provide \nadditional income to projects.11  \n    \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n16.  The eventual impact of the TA will be to contribute to energy security, regional stability, \nand environmental integrity by better managing the future demand for oil in DMCs. The outcome \n                                                 \n11 For instance, a clean energy project could earn both FSCs for its contribution to enhance energy security as well \nas carbon credits for helping to address climate change by cutting GHG emissions.  \n ", "4   \nwill be an assessment of the rationale and a detailed concept for the formation of a sustainable \nfuel partnership in Asia. The partnership will bring together a number of different stakeholders \nfor  the  purpose  of  establishing  a  new  market  mechanism  to  monetize  the  value  of  oil \nconsumption management. This mechanism will help create an incentive for national and local \ngovernments (among others) to promote alternative policies, technologies, systems, and fuels. \nThe TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 2 years and will involve developing a major study and \ntwo proposals. The main output will be a study that assesses the importance and rationale for \ncreating  a  new  market  mechanism  that  will  provide  an  incentive  for  national  and  local \ngovernments to pursue sustainable energy-transport infrastructure that is less dependent on oil. \nThe  study  will  assess  the  potential  savings  in  oil  consumption  that  could  result  from \nimplementing various policy and technology options across DMCs. It will then model the impact \non national government budgets and the macroeconomic impacts for ADB\u2019s developed and \ndeveloping member countries that are major oil importers. It will also analyze the potential \nglobal oil price impacts of implementing different measures compared to projections based on a \nBAU scenario. This study is proposed to be jointly implemented through a partnership between \nkey institutions with expertise on energy (IEA) and transport (Oxford University\u2019s Environmental \nChange Institute), as well as finance and regional cooperation (ADB and the ADB Institute). \nAppendix 4 shows the proposed outline of the study. \n \n18.  In addition, the TA will develop a proposal for a pilot scheme that will demonstrate the \neffect of this new market mechanism in stimulating new project development. The pilot will take \nthe form of a trust fund that will provide financing to assist selected governments (national or \nlocal)  to  implement  various  energy  saving  measures.  Among  other  elements  outlined  in \nAppendix  1,  the  proposal  will  include  principles  to  prevent  the  adoption  of  policies  and \ntechnologies that increase local air pollutants and GHG emissions, as well as to safeguard \nagainst promoting fuels from feedstock that directly compete with food crops. Development of \nthe proposal will involve conducting a series of workshops to consult with various government \nagencies and expert institutions on the optimum approach to implementing a pilot scheme.  \n \n19.  Finally, the TA will develop a proposal that will describe how to establish and administer \na market scheme for FSCs. It will incorporate lessons from similar market-based initiatives, \nincluding the existing renewable energy regulatory infrastructure that is well established in the \nUnited States for power markets, and the global GHG emission trading scheme functioning in \nEurope, Japan, DMCs, and other markets. The proposal will also explore the possibility of \nvoluntary \"smart targets\" being adopted by participating countries and cities. It will likely be \njointly  developed  with  intergovernmental  bodies,  such  as  the  Asia-Pacific  Economic \nCooperation  and  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations,  and/or  existing  multilateral \npartnerships such as the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate.12   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n20.  The total amount of the TA is estimated at $1,250,000. ADB will finance the equivalent of \n$950,000 on a grant basis by its TA funding program (Technical Assistance Special Fund-other \n                                                 \n12 The Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate is an effort launched in 2006 that seeks to \naccelerate the development and deployment of clean energy technologies by major developed and developing \nnations. \n ", "  5\nsources). The equivalent of $300,000 will be financed as a grant from the Government of \nAustria, to be administered by ADB.13 The funds will support equipment;14 trainings, seminars, \nand workshops; publications and information services; fees and remuneration for international \nand national consultants and technical experts; miscellaneous administration and support costs; \nand consultants and ADB resource staff members who participate in country programming and \nproject missions. The detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  ADB, as the Executing Agency, is expected to implement the TA through its Sustainable \nInfrastructure Division of the Regional and Sustainable Development Department. It will be \nimplemented in close collaboration with relevant internal departments and external partners. \nWithin ADB, the TA under the Sustainable Transport Initiative will maximize synergies with other \nongoing  initiatives  and  programs  that  promote  clean  energy  projects,  such  as  the  Energy \nEfficiency Initiative, Carbon Market Initiative, and the Cities Development Initiative for Asia.15 It \nwill also work closely with other donor-led initiatives.   \n \n22.  To date, no specific DMC has been identified in whose territory any specific activity of \nthe TA will be undertaken; however, any activity funded by this TA will only commence in a \nparticular DMC after ADB has received a no-objection in writing from the government of the \nDMC.  \n \n23.  The TA will begin in September 2009 and will be carried out over a 24-month period, \nconcluding in August 2011. Individual international experts (28 person-months) and national \nconsultants (28 person-months) will be engaged intermittently over the implementation period \nunder the direct supervision of the Sustainable Infrastructure Division. In addition, $414,000 has \nbeen budgeted to recruit international firms (for 21 person-months) on a fixed-budget-selection \nbasis.  These  firms  will  be  selected  after  submission  of  biodata  technical  proposals.  It  is \nenvisaged that the firms\u2019 expertise will include energy economics, urban and transport planning, \nand  market  mechanisms.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  are  provided  in  Appendix  3.  All \nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time).   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of Austria; and (ii) ADB providing the balance not \nexceeding the equivalent of $950,000 on a grant basis, for the Sustainable Fuel Partnership \nStudy: Exploring an Innovative Market Scheme to Advance Sustainable Transport and Fuel \nSecurity, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n13 Additional details are provided in Appendix 2, footnote a. \n14 The equipment will be procured and disposed of in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time). \n15 The Cities Development Initiative for Asia establishes partnerships with city governments across Asia to provide \nsupport for pre-feasibility studies on a range of major infrastructure projects and identify financing agencies. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions \nSummary  and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact       Assumptions \n       \nEnhance energy security,  Oil consumption and  Official statistics on oil  Demand for liquid fuel \nregional stability, and  associated emissions in pilot  use  continues to increase after the \nenvironmental integrity by  countries and cities reduced    global economy recovers \nbetter managing the future  from business-as-usual     \ndemand for oil in ADB  trends    NGOs, institutions, think \nDMCs through the      tanks, and/or government \nestablishment of a  Partner cities adopt  Press releases,  agencies in the region are \npartnership focusing on a  voluntary \"smart targets\" for  government reports  capable of implementing \nnew market mechanism  fuel consumption    certification scheme for fuel \nmanagement    security credits \n     \nCertification and trading of  Reports on over-the- Countries in the region are \nfuel security credits, a new  counter trade of fuel  willing to adopt voluntary \ncommodity that would  security credits  \"smart targets\" for fuel \nmonetize the contribution of  consumption management \noil consumption   \nmanagement measures to   Risks \nenergy security   \n  Increased political tensions \n  over oil prices makes the \ninitiative politically untenable \n \nDifferences between countries \nmake development of regional \nscheme problematic \nOutcome       Assumptions \n       \nAn established rationale  Joining of several  Press releases,  The results of the assessment \nand procedures for the  progressive local and/or  government reports  study show benefits for both \nformation of a sustainable  national governments into    DMCs and donor countries  \nfuel partnership that will  the sustainable fuel  Progress report on the   \nexplore a market-based  partnership to pursue  sustainable fuel  Interest from national and/or \nmechanism to promote oil  alternative policies and  partnership  local DMC governments in \nconsumption management  technologies    addressing fuel demand \n    Confirmed funding from  management \nA pilot scheme to test how  An established funding  founding donor countries   \na market mechanism may  scheme to demonstrate the    Some countries, especially \nwork in practice  mechanism and potential    large importers, are willing to \ncost-benefit of fuel security    fund a pilot scheme \ncredits   \n   Risks \n   \nStudy does not show sufficient \neconomic merit \n \nPlanning and dialogue get \nbogged down by details, thus \nprolonging, or even derailing, \ndevelopment of the \nsustainable fuel partnership \nOutputs       Assumptions \n        \n1.
