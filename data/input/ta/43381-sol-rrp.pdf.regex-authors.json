An environmental assessment and review procedure \nAssessment  has been prepared for the project (Supplementary Appendix A), \nand the sample subprojects have undergone initial environmental \nexamination  (IEE)  (Supplementary  Appendixes  B  and  C).  The \nproject  includes  climate  change  adaptation  measures \n(Supplementary Appendix D). \n  \nProject Description  To make the national network of provincial and secondary roads \nmore efficient and effective the Solomon Islands Second Road \nImprovement (Sector) Project will (i) replace or upgrade about \n30 water crossings (bridges, culverts, and wet crossings), build \nabout  20  kilometers  (km)  of  roads  and  associated  bridge \napproaches,  and  selectively  relocate  roads  for  climate  change \nadaptation;  (ii)  maintain  roads  using  labor-based, \nequipment-supported  (LBES)  techniques  under  national  private \nsector  contracts  involving  local  communities;  and  (iii) carry  out \nproject  management,  implementation  supervision,  and  capacity \ndevelopment  including  a  community  education  and  awareness \ncampaign.  Climate  change  adaptation  measures  will  be \nincorporated into the subproject designs. \n  \nRationale  The project is aimed at (i) making social services more accessible \nto poor and rural households, (ii) giving such households more \nopportunities  for  employment  and  income  generation, \n(iii) increasing private sector participation in economic activities, \n(iv) reducing rural poverty by bringing about the development of \nremote  areas,  and  (v) giving  preference  to  areas  of  previous \nunderinvestment.  \n  \nImpact and Outcome  The project will lead to economic and social development, and to \nreduced hardship and poverty. It will improve access to services \nand markets, thereby providing better opportunities for economic \ngrowth. The project will generate employment opportunities for \nrural communities, increase the number of national contractors, \nand increase female participation in road maintenance contracts.  \n   ", "ii   \n Project Investment Plan   The cost of the project is estimated at $24.0 million, excluding \ntaxes and duties.  \n   \n Financing Plan    Amount  Share \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank   15.00  62.5 \nGovernment of Australiaa  4.50  18.8 \nEuropean Commission  3.34b  13.9 \nGovernment of Solomon Islands  1.16  4.8 \na  Through the Memorandum of Understanding on Channel Financing (Technical \nAssistance  Program)  between  the  Government  of  the  Commonwealth  of \nAustralia and the Asian Development Bank (ADB).

The \nArrangements  pre-construction activities are already at an advanced stage under \nthe ongoing Solomon Islands Road Improvement (Sector) Project \n(SIRIP). The permanent secretary for MID will be responsible for \nproject  implementation.  A  project  management  unit  (PMU) \ncomprising  technical,  administrative,  and  accounting  staff  and \nheaded by a professionally qualified civil engineer will manage \nand  administer  the  project  under  the  guidance  of  the  project \nsteering committee established under SIRIP.  \n   ", "  iii\nProcurement  Procurement  under  the  project  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Expanded \nprocurement  eligibility  for  ADB  to  administer  European \nCommission cofinancing will require Board approval. International \ncompetitive bidding (ICB) procurement will primarily apply to major \nstructural  works  (bridges,  river  training,  road  approaches  and \nprotection  works,  sealed  road).  Road  pavement  and  drainage \nimprovements on the existing carriageway of gravel and feeder \nroads  will  be  procured  through  national  competitive  bidding, \nshopping, or small-scale private sector contracting for the use of \nLBES techniques with community participation. The evaluation of \nICB  contracts  will  include  a  margin  of  preference  for  national \ncontractors, as specified in ADB\u2019s procurement guidelines. \n   \nConsulting Services  The project will require consulting support\u201453 person-months of \ninternational  and  158  person-months  of  national  consulting \nservices\u2014in  addition  to  the  assistance  in  feasibility  studies, \ndetailed  engineering  design,  project  management,  and \nimplementation supervision that are now being provided to the \nproject  management  and  capacity  building  unit  created  under \nSIRIP.  All  consulting  recruitment,  with  one  exception,  will  use \nADB\u2019s  quality- and  cost-based  selection  method  based  on \nsimplified technical proposals and conforms to ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \nConsulting  support  for  the  HIV  education  and  awareness \ncampaign, however, will be recruited through ADB\u2019s single-source \nselection method. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The benefits of the project will accrue from (i) savings in travel \nBeneficiaries  time, vehicle operating cost, and freight cost on existing modes of \ntravel, and a shift to lower-cost modes; (ii) a reduction in periodic \nroute severance by floods, and in the associated safety risks and \neconomic  and  social  disruption;  and  (iii) better  connectivity  in \npreviously hard-to-reach areas, stimulating agricultural production \nthrough  easier  access  to  markets,  and  improving  health  and \neducation through reliable access to schools and health facilities. \n  \nRisks and Assumptions  The  completion  of  the  remaining  subprojects  is  subject  to \ntechnical risks that are largely within the control of MID. These \nrisks  can  be  satisfactorily  mitigated  through  sound  project \nmanagement and supervision. The main financial risks lie in the \nuncertainty  of  the  construction  market\u2019s  response  to  the \nsubprojects. That matter will be settled by the time the financing \nfor the second-phase project is approved, as tenders have been \nadvertised.  The  institutional  risks  will  be  mitigated  by  ongoing \nsupport for MID management from the PMU. \n  \n ", "156 o 00'E 150 o 00'E 170 o 00'W\nN o r t h     P a c i f i c     O c e a n\nP2h0io Sl i0ep0ap'Nine MARSHALL  ISLANDS International  D PACIFIC  REGION 20o  00'N\nREPUBLIC ateline\nOF PALAU FEDERATED STATES OF\nMICRONESIA\nONTONG JAVA 0o 0o\n(Lord Howe Atoll) NAURU\nKe Loma K     I     R     I     B     A     T     I\nLuaniua INDONESIA PAPUA\nNEW GUINEA SOLOMON\nISLANDS TUVALU\n6 o 00'S 6 o 00'S SAMOA\nRoncador Reef C o r a l   S e a VANUATU ISCLOAONKDS\nREPUBLIC\nTaro CHOISEUL 20o  00'S OFF ITJHIE TONGA 20o  00'S\nISLANDS\nPROVINCE\nA U S T R A L I A\nS o u t h     P a c i f i c     O c e a n\nPapara\nShortlandVella KoloVmagbhaenMngaaanrnaing Straits Kia PRISOAVBINELCE 150 o 00'E 1661 o7 00 o0 0'0E'W\nMaravar\nRanongga Noro Buala\nGizo\nSimbo Munda Susubona Sepi Malu'u Sikaiana SOLOMON ISLANDS\nPWREOSVTIENRCNE RendovaBlanche ChannelVanguRnuuYsasPenCldRlEinONaVTIRNACSLEavoFlorTiduaIlnadegpehnAdieuncke iStraits PMROAOteLVoAtIeNITaCAE SECO(NSDE CRTOOARD)  IPMRPORJOEVCETMENT\nHONIARA Aola Liwe\nUlawa\nAvu Avu\nGUADALCANAL Duff\nHauratarata\nPROVINCE\nKira Kira\nReef \nN S  o  l  o  m  o  n         S  e  a Lata\nTEMOTU\nMAKIRA Nendo PROVINCE\nPROVINCE\nSANTA CRUZ ISLANDS\n0 20 40 60 80 100 Tinggoa Utupua\nRENBEL Anuta\nPeou\n12 o 00'S Kilometers PROVINCE Vanikolo 12 o 00'S\nFataka\nTikopia\nNational Capital S  O  U  T  H      P  A  C  I  F  I  C      O  C  E  A  N\nProvincial Capital\nTown\nInternational Boundary\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n0\n9\n-3\n2\n9\n0 H 156 o 00'E 166 o 00'E\nR", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \ngrant, and (ii) the proposed administration of grants to be provided by the Government of \nAustralia1  and  the  European  Commission,  both  to  Solomon  Islands  for  the  Second  Road \nImprovement (Sector) Project.  \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Six large islands, dozens of smaller islands, and hundreds of islets and atolls make up \nthe 28,000 square kilometers in land area of Solomon Islands. More than 80% of the population \nis rural, living in widely dispersed villages of a few hundred persons. Infrastructure and services, \nespecially in the rural areas, are inadequate. Improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness \nof the national road network under the project will make the rural areas more accessible and \npromote development. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n3.  The economy is based on primary commodities from agriculture, forestry, and fishing. \nJobs are limited: only about a quarter of the population is formally employed. Income-generating \nopportunities in the rural areas are scarce. Infrastructure investments are needed for economic \ngrowth, employment, poverty reduction, and social development. \n \n4.  The road network reaches only about a quarter of the rural villages. About 60% of the \nnetwork is on Guadalcanal and Malaita, which serve about 90% of the traffic in the country. \nSealed or graveled roads are confined to Guadalcanal and Malaita, which also have the only \nsignificant inland roads, and a segment of secondary road in the Western Province. The other \nsix provinces have relatively short coastal segments of gravel or earth roads near the provincial \ncenters. Widespread deferment of maintenance has left provincial and secondary roads in the \nrural provinces so badly deteriorated that they can no longer be maintained and urgently need \nrehabilitation. At the Government\u2019s request, the Solomon Islands Road Improvement (Sector) \nProject  (SIRIP)  was  prepared  and  is  now  being  implemented  with  a  preferential  focus on \naddressing the urgent need in the underserved parts of the country. 2 A chronology of events \nunder SIRIP is in Appendix 2 and an analysis of the road subsector is in Appendix 3.   \n \n5.  The proposed project will implement the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) strategy for \nSolomon  Islands  by  (i) upgrading  and  preserving  transport  infrastructure,  (ii) facilitating  the \nexpansion of transport services, (iii) strengthening the enabling environment for private sector \ndevelopment, and (iv) providing opportunities for the private sector and local communities to \nparticipate  directly  in  the  project  activities.  Further,  the  project  will  guide  future  external \nassistance in the road subsector through better aid coordination and consistent development \nplanning, while serving as a basis for the Government\u2019s investments in the subsector. \n                                                 \n1  Through the Memorandum of Understanding on Channel Financing (Technical Assistance Program) between the \nGovernment of the Commonwealth of Australia and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n2  ADB. 2006. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Asian \nDevelopment Fund Grant to the Solomon Islands for the Road Improvement (Sector) Project. Manila (Grants \n0048/0049/0050-SOL, approved on 8 August, cofinanced by ADB [$0.35 million], the Government of Australia \n[$6.10 million], and the Government of New Zealand [$9.75 million]). \n ", "2 \n1.  The Government\u2019s Sector Strategy \n6.  The Government\u2019s development vision, priorities, and strategies are expressed in the \nMedium-Term  Development  Strategy  (MTDS)  2008\u20132010. 3   There  are  six  priorities:  (i) \nreconciliation and rehabilitation, (ii) national security and foreign relations, (iii) infrastructure \ndevelopment, (iv) social services, (v) the economic and productive sectors, and (vi) civic affairs. \nInfrastructure  development  and  private  sector\u2013led  growth  also  have  high  priority.  The \nGovernment has announced its intention to align budget formulation and implementation with \nthese  priorities,  especially  in  the  delivery  of  essential  services  and  policy  reform.  The \nsecond-largest  slice  of  program  funds  under  MTDS  2008\u20132010,  after  the  economic  and \nproductive sectors, goes to infrastructure programs. The transport policies in MTDS 2008\u20132010 \nemphasize the need to rehabilitate and maintain infrastructure to reverse past neglect and \nprovide better market access and service delivery, for rural development.  \n \n7.  With ADB assistance, the Government has prepared its National Transport Plan (NTP) \nand created the transport policy and planning unit (TPPU) under the Ministry of Infrastructure \nDevelopment (MID).4 The NTP provides the strategic framework and a 3-year action plan for \ndeveloping and maintaining physical infrastructure, facilitating transport services, improving the \ncapacity of government agencies, and increasing private sector participation. It is centered on \n(i) rehabilitating high-priority roads and bridges on Guadalcanal and Malaita; (ii) extending such \nrehabilitation to other provinces; (iii) strengthening the capacity to manage projects, contracts, \nand road assets; and (iv) promoting the participation of the private sector, communities, women, \nand youth groups in road maintenance. \n \n8.  To  implement  the  NTP,  Parliament  passed  the  National  Transport  Fund  (NTF)  Act \ncreating the NTF in 2008. Government funds for transport infrastructure improvement are now \nchanneled through the NTF and managed by TPPU, but regulations for the full operation of the \nNTF under a board of directors are being prepared. The Government\u2019s transport task force, \ncomprising representatives from key government agencies, advises MID and the TPPU on key \nissues, development options, and priorities. The Government has also embarked on institutional \nreforms, with ADB assistance, to reinforce its capacity to implement a sector project effectively. \nThe comprehensive implementation assistance and capacity building under SIRIP has also \nresulted in greater community involvement, sector plans that are more responsive to community \nneeds, and rural economic development through increased productivity and opportunities for \noccasional labor. \n2.  ADB\u2019s Interim Country Partnership Strategy \n9.  ADB\u2019s interim country partnership strategy 2009\u201320115 for Solomon Islands seeks to \npromote equitable private sector\u2013led economic growth by improving transportation infrastructure \nand services and strengthening the enabling environment for business, and thereby reduce \npoverty. Capacity development and good governance are guiding priorities in this regard, and \nthe fullest use will be made of links between these priority areas. \n \n10.  ADB is implementing SIRIP (footnote 2) to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of \nthe national network of provincial and secondary roads by (i) rehabilitating about 100 kilometers \n                                                 \n3  Government of Solomon Islands. 2008.

Physical  works,  which  began  in  March  2007  and  are  about  42% \ncomplete,  are  scheduled  for  completion  in  December  2011.  SIRIP  is  cofinanced  by  the \ngovernments of Australia and New Zealand, with ADB administering all the cofinancing. A \ndetailed description of SIRIP\u2019s status is in Appendix 4.  \n \n11.  Under SIRIP, ADB has also helped MID to move away from the direct implementation of \nworks  and  toward  a  greater  emphasis  on  sector  planning  and  governance.  The  project \nmanagement and capacity building unit formed under SIRIP is developing capacity within MID \nand TPPU to concentrate on policy development, planning and programming, regulation, asset \nmanagement, administration, supervision, and quality assurance, and to promote private sector \nparticipation. ADB continues to provide technical assistance (TA) to support the transition, \nupdate the NTP, and establish an asset management system.7  \n \n12.  In recognition of ADB\u2019s long experience in implementing projects and TA in the road \nsubsector of Solomon Islands, as well as its expertise in designing and monitoring safeguards, \nthe Government has requested ADB to take the lead in coordinating aid in the road subsector, \nand  other  partners  have  agreed.  ADB\u2019s  country  program  in  transportation  complements \nassistance under way or being considered by other development partners\u2014including project \npreparatory  TA  in  2009  for  potential  investment  in  transport  infrastructure  development  in \n2010\u2014by  creating  a  transportation  system  that  will  link  rural  areas  to  markets  and  social \nservices in urban centers. The NTP and the institutional reforms within MID are key factors in \ncoordination. \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities  \n13.  As a fragile country emerging from several years of conflict and, more recently, natural \ndisasters,  Solomon  Islands  is  confronting  many  challenges  and  opportunities.  The  most \npressing needs are (i) sustained economic growth, (ii) more employment and income-generating \nopportunities,  (iii)  a  stronger  institutional  framework  for  managing  and  administering  public \nsector responsibilities, and (iv) improved human and institutional capacity. Progress in these \nareas is expected to contribute directly to reducing poverty.  \n1.  Problems and Constraints \n14.  Employment and Income Generation. Falling commodity prices, deteriorating rural \ninfrastructure, lack of rural services and access to markets, and low-productivity traditional \ncultivation practices hamper rural agricultural development. Poor and expensive infrastructure \nfacilities and services, a weak legal and institutional business environment, inadequate business \nand banking services, and a limited market constrain the development of the private sector and \nemployment growth. \n \n                                                 \n6  The LBES technique uses labor and equipment (usually medium or intermediate sized) for the cost-effective \nprovision or maintenance of infrastructure to a specified standard. \n7  ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to Solomon Islands for Preparing the Domestic Maritime Support Project and \nTechnical Support Program. Manila (TA 4980-SOL). \n ", "4 \n15.  Sector Investments, Operations, and Sustainability. Road sustainability is a major \nchallenge. Financial constraints, poor equipment maintenance, and geographic conditions have \ncontributed  to  poor  road  maintenance  for  many  years.  As  a  result,  many  roads  need \nrehabilitation so that they can be maintained once again and support traffic. However, the \ngovernment budget provides only for maintenance and not for new investments, and the high \ndebt burden rules out further borrowing. Therefore, projects must be prioritized and sequenced \nto maximize the benefits. Past efforts, directed mostly at basic maintenance and emergency \nworks, were inadequate and costly. A shift to sustainable rehabilitation and preventive asset \nmanagement is needed to keep the network fit for use.  \n \n16.  Road Network Development. Because of poor asset management, about 70% of the \nroad network can no longer be maintained, and requires reconstruction or rehabilitation. The \nGovernment has invested about $11 million from domestic sources and $96 million in external \nfunding in the road subsector over the past 2 decades (Appendix 5). Improvements on about \n140 km  of  national  roads  under  ongoing  projects  will  guarantee  all-weather  access.8  The \nrehabilitation of about 200 km is being carried out under the Community Sector Program of the \nAustralian Agency for International Development (AusAID). These interventions have achieved \nall-weather access on almost all national roads. However, on provincial and secondary roads, \nbridges must be repaired or replaced, pavement reshaped and strengthened, and drainage \nimproved. Village and farm roads also need improvement to allow poor rural communities to \nshare in the benefits.  \n \n17.  Road Maintenance Funds and Budgeting. Roads are being maintained as they are \ngradually being rehabilitated. Road maintenance funding has increased by an average of 20% \nyearly since the start of SIRIP. The maintenance funds have increased but are still not enough. \nRoad inventories and condition surveys are being undertaken as part of the NTP update. The \nresults  will  feed  into  the  road  asset  management  system,  which  will  generate  annual \nmaintenance funds for the network. Maintaining the rehabilitated lengths of road to all-weather \naccess conditions will continue to require investment support. \n \n18.  Lessons. Historically, most projects in the road subsector have used force-account \nprocedures, and only a few have been done under contract. Projects lacked quality at entry and \nwere built to poor standards, and were therefore unsustainable. Key institutional and policy \nissues  were  not  resolved;  these  included  (i) inaction  on  the  overloading  of  logging  trucks, \n(ii) shortfall in maintenance funding in favor of capital expenditure, (iii) failure to institutionalize \nan effective asset management system, and (iv) limited national contracting capacity for road \nmaintenance  and  rehabilitation.  SIRIP  has  made  significant  advances  in  (i) addressing  the \nfunding issue through the legal establishment of the NTF, (ii) setting up asset management \nsystems within MID, and (iii) encouraging the formation of small and medium-sized enterprises \nto undertake road maintenance with LBES techniques under simple contract procedures. The \nnew  LBES  techniques  have  proven  successful  but  require  close  attention  to  training, \nsupervision, and performance standards, as well as commitment to routine maintenance once \nthe roads have been rehabilitated. \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2006.

Although  the  road  transport  subsector  can  contribute  significantly  to  national \ndevelopment,  it  has  underperformed  because  of  neglect  and  poor  implementation.  Recent \nproject interventions, including SIRIP, have improved sector performance through integrated \nand  sustained  attention  to  asset  management,  institutional  reform,  project  planning  and \nselection, outsourcing, and increased institutional capacity; these improvements, in turn, have \ncreated  clear  opportunities  for  road  infrastructure  investment  to  produce  more-significant \neconomic and social benefits to the country.  \n \n20.  Labor-Based,  Equipment-Supported  Maintenance  Techniques.  SIRIP  has \nintroduced LBES techniques in small-scale maintenance contracts to develop the capacity of \nthe  country\u2019s  small  to  medium-sized  contractors.  LBES  methods  of  rehabilitating  and \nmaintaining roads and bridges are widely supported and contribute to community engagement, \nrural employment, and private sector development as cost-effective means of maintaining rural \nroads. The techniques are being implemented in other externally assisted projects and MID\u2019s \nown recurrent maintenance programs. The proposed project presents opportunities to adopt the \nLBES maintenance program and build on this record of success.  \n \n21.  Infrastructure Improvements for Economic Development and Rural Employment. \nAn  improved  and  sustainable  rural  road  network  can  significantly  boost  rural  economic \ndevelopment. As access improves and transport costs go down, rural incomes will increase and \nso will production and employment. Rehabilitating provincial and secondary roads can aid \nconnectivity  and  lower  the  costs  of  access  to  markets,  towns,  and  social  facilities.  Road \nmaintenance contracts where LBES techniques are used have generated income for the rural \npopulation. Rural incomes could improve further with the opportunities to expand these activities \nunder the proposed project. \n \n22.  Community and Gender Participation. SIRIP has succeeded in involving communities \nin road rehabilitation and maintenance. As the road network expands, the LBES approach is \ngaining more interest and acceptability in the local communities. Women have more opportunity \nto participate actively, in road maintenance contracts that follow this approach. They are twice \nas likely to be employed as men, because contractors are required to encourage women to \nparticipate  in  road  maintenance.  Moreover,  because  LBES  techniques  do  not  use  heavy \nmachinery, they are better suited to women. Through community consultation, expressions of \ninterest are received from potential female contractors among individual women and women\u2019s \ngroups. These female contractors are identified and trained under the capacity development \ncomponent of SIRIP. The project offers opportunities to build and expand community and \ngender participation. \n3.  Rationale for the Project \n23.  Pro-poor economic growth and improvement in social and health indicators call for a \nrevitalized and decentralized rural economy. Poor roads constrain the movement of people and \ngoods  and  discourage  productive  rural  activity.  Transport  infrastructure  and  services  must \nimprove to provide reliable access to domestic and international markets for rural produce and \ncommodities, and thereby (i) restart and build rural economies, (ii) reduce the migration of \npeople in search of employment, (iii) decrease conflict between groups competing for limited \nopportunities, and (iv) restore basic social services in rural areas. Improved rural accessibility \nwill help reduce poverty. \n ", "6 \n \n24.  Most  previous  projects,  representing  more  than  90%  of  investment  in  the  road \nsubsector, have been concentrated in Guadalcanal and Malaita. The other seven provinces \nhave received less attention. 9 The Government has requested that the road connectivity needs \nof these seven provinces be given preferential focus in the preparation of the project, with \nsubprojects selected on the basis of the NTP priorities, as well as the urgency of restoring the \nroad links damaged by floods in February 2009. The project will deliver external assistance for \ninfrastructure development to restore or provide connectivity that requires the technical and \nfinancial  capacity  of  larger  international  and  national  construction  firms,  in  particular  the \nreplacement of bridges, other water crossings, and approach roads, and the realignment of new \nroads  for  climate  change  adaptation.  Existing  gravel  roads  can  then  undergo  restorative \nmaintenance under small-scale LBES maintenance contracts, using systems established under \nSIRIP.  \n \n25.  The project will (i) expand the scope of rehabilitation beyond Guadalcanal and Malaita, \n(ii) make  permanent  repairs  in  the  water  crossings  on  Guadalcanal  West  Road  that  were \ndamaged  by  the  50-year  flood  of  February  2009,10  and  (iii)  provide  for  climate  change \nadaptation. The feasibility studies and detail engineering designs for two subprojects are in \nadvance stages of completion. The Makira subproject, the bigger subproject with 72.5 km of \nroads and 25 water crossings, is at the contract award stage, while the Guadalcanal subproject \nis at the detailed engineering design stage. A third subproject, this one in Malaita, is being \nidentified for inclusion under the project. Other subprojects will also be included, depending on \nthe availability of funds. The project will be implemented as a sector project and will finance \nthree subprojects. The above proposal is consistent with the original objectives of SIRIP and \nsupports the Government\u2019s desire for ADB to take the lead in the road subsector and establish a \nprocess  of  coordinating  aid  to  the  subsector  and  making  such  aid  more  predictable.  The \nsubprojects will be selected from the NTP list of priority roads. \n \n26.  Advances in building the capacity of MID for road planning, road asset management, \ncontract  management,  and  construction  supervision  through  the  project  management  and \ncapacity building unit established under SIRIP must be formalized for long-term sustainability. \nThe NTF should be made the operative funding mechanism for road maintenance and funding \napplication, disbursement, and oversight, so that the roads subsector becomes less reliant on \nexternal  financial  assistance  over  the  medium  term,  as  part  of  the  implementation  of  the \ntransport sector strategy and NTP. A sector-wide approach to external development assistance \nbased on domestic processes will promote effective planning and implementation of works in \nthe long term. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n27.  The project will remove transport accessibility constraints on economic growth and social \ndevelopment in the subproject areas by restoring or providing road connectivity and improving \nreliability of access in the face of natural hazards. The impact will be economic growth, social \ndevelopment, and reduction of hardship and poverty in the areas served by the subprojects.  \n \n                                                 \n9  The seven other provinces are Central, Choiseul, Isabel, Makira, Renbel, Temotu, and Western. \n10 A 50-year flood is a destructive flood of a magnitude that occurs once in 50 years or has a 2% probability of \noccurring in any given year. \n ", "7 \n28.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  road  transport  that  supports  economic  and  social \nactivities  by  (i) restoring  or  providing  road  connectivity  between  rural  areas  and  the  main \nregional  centers;  (ii) reducing  susceptibility  to  closures  from  natural  hazards;  (iii) reducing \ntransport  costs,  and  making  the  transport  of  people  and  goods  more  reliable  and  safe; \n(iv) encouraging increased cultivation of land with agricultural potential, and the marketing of \ncash crops for national and international trade; (v) providing opportunities for people to travel for \nemployment;  (vi) providing  access  to  health,  education,  and  other  social  and  community \nservices and so improving the health and education of the affected population; and (vii) reducing \ntravel fatalities and injuries, particularly among young people, women, and the elderly. \nB.  Outputs  \n29.  Road Rehabilitation. The project will finance (i) selected road and bridge rehabilitation \nworks in the seven provinces not covered by SIRIP, according to the priorities set in the NTP; \n(ii) the permanent repair of roads damaged in the February 2009 flood event and the upgrading \nof the waterway crossing; and (iii) road relocation for climate change adaptation. There will be \ntwo core subprojects: the Kirakira\u2013Wainuri road in Makira Province and the West Guadalcanal \nRoad between Poha Stream and Naro Hill (flood restoration and upgrading). The work will \ninvolve replacing or upgrading about 30 water crossings (bridges, culverts, and wet crossings), \nbuilding about 20 km of associated bridge approaches, and relocating roads for climate change \nadaptation. Of the 20 km of associated bridge approaches, about 10 km will be sealed to \nprevent the loss of pavement materials during heavy rain and floods. Each subproject from the \nNTP  will  be  prioritized  and  selected  according  to  the  process  and  eligibility  criteria  in \nAppendix 6. \n \n30.  A systematic and consultative approach will be established for subproject appraisal, \ncovering  (i)  social,  economic,  and  environmental  evaluation;  (ii)  design;  (iii)  procurement; \n(iv) implementation; and (v) monitoring. Each subproject feasibility study will provide sufficient \nevidence of eligibility under the agreed criteria, and will have the required detail and quality to \nenable ADB to assess the viability and suitability of the subproject. No subproject categorized \nas  category  A,  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2003)  or  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995), will be financed under the project. Implementation will incorporate \nHIV awareness and prevention, as well as general health and safety, activities, as appropriate. \nClimate change adaptation measures will be incorporated into the subproject designs. \n \n31.  Road  Maintenance.  This  will  comprise  the  annual  maintenance  of  road  sections \nconstructed under SIRIP, past and ongoing investment projects, and the project, through private \nsector  LBES  techniques  developed  under  SIRIP  and  routine  maintenance  involving  local \ncommunities.  \n \n32.  Project  Management  and  Capacity  Development.  The project will provide project \nmanagement and capacity development through a project management unit (PMU), which will \nplan, assess, design, manage, and implement the road, drainage, and bridge works under road \nrehabilitation and maintenance. \nC.  Special Features  \n33.  Continuity and Consolidation with SIRIP. SIRIP for the most part is being smoothly \nimplemented by MID, the executing agency. Capacity development, community participation, \nand private sector development have increased. A second phase would provide opportunities to \n ", "8 \nconsolidate progress and ensure that the improvements in procedures and capacity become \npermanent features of MID\u2019s business processes. In addition, the project will allow the MID and \nthe small- and medium-scale private sector contractors developed under SIRIP to strengthen \nand expand their capacity. The ongoing support for road maintenance will secure the continued \nmaintenance of the roads rehabilitated under SIRIP. \n \n34.  Cofinancing  and  Donor  Harmonization.  ADB\u2019s  strategy  in  Solomon  Islands \nemphasizes coordination with development partners and encourages cofinancing, a feature of \nall projects approved by ADB since 2000. For the project, the Government of Australia has \nagreed to provide cofinancing of $4.50 million from the Pacific Region Infrastructure Facility, for \nthe restoration of permanent works for the Guadalcanal subproject. The European Commission \nhas committed to provide cofinancing of \u20ac2.475 million ($3.34 million equivalent) for the road \nrehabilitation component on Guadalcanal and Malaita. \n \n35.  Community  Participation  and  Labor-Intensive  Employment.  The  project  will \ngenerate employment opportunities and increase the number of national contractors through \ncommunity LBES contracts to rehabilitate and maintain rural roads. Under these arrangements, \nnational and community contractors are being trained in ongoing projects to undertake road \nrehabilitation and maintenance contracts. Women workers are participating in greater numbers, \nand women contractors are gaining more capacity through on-the-job training. This model will \ncontinue in the proposed project, which will feature rigorously expanded LBES techniques in \nroad maintenance contracts. \n \n36.  Climate Change Adaptation. The project will have these climate change adaptation \nfeatures: (i) watercourse crossings designed to accept higher floods and river debris loads; (ii) \nbridge abutments anchored to piled foundations to minimize the collapse of abutments and \napproach roads; (iii) river training works to minimize the deviation of watercourses from their \noriginal path; (iv) strengthened protection to approach roads with additional protection and river \ntraining works; (v) where a raised water table makes the road more flood prone, side slopes \ndesigned to prevent erosion through gradient and protection, and a raised road surface; and (vi) \nrerouting of coastal sections of road exposed to wave action and king-tide inundation away from \nthe immediate foreshore. Supplementary Appendix D describes the project\u2019s climate change \nadaptation strategies. \n \n37.  Nongovernment Organizations in HIV Education. SIRIP has pioneered new methods \nof raising awareness of HIV and educating rural communities about its dangers. Contractors \nprovide HIV education and make condoms accessible to all their employees. Save the Children \nAustralia, in conjunction with a local nongovernment organization (NGO), will be contracted to \nprovide community awareness programs. Awareness materials are reinforced during community \nmaintenance work, and MID actively monitor compliance with contract requirements. These \narrangements would continue under the project. \n ", "9 \nD.  Project Investment Plan  \n38.  The project is estimated to require an investment of $24.0 million, excluding taxes and \nduties, as shown in Table 1.

Financing Plan  \n39.  The  Government  has  requested  a  grant  of  $15.00  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Asian \nDevelopment Fund to help finance the project costs. The Government of Australia, through the \nPacific Region Infrastructure Facility, will provide grant cofinancing equivalent to $4.50 million, \nto  be  administered  by  ADB.11  The  European  Commission  will  provide  grant  cofinancing \nequivalent to $3.34 million, also to be administered by ADB.12  The Government of Solomon \nIslands will provide $1.16 million. Withdrawals from the grant account will be based on 100% of \neligible expenditures for each claim received, up to the total amount to be financed by the grant, \nexclusive of taxes and duties. The detailed financing plan is in Appendix 7, and is summarized \nin Table 2. \n \n                                                 \n11  Through the Memorandum of Understanding on Channel Financing (Technical Assistance Program) between the \nGovernment of the Commonwealth of Australia and the Asian Development Bank.  \n12 This amount includes ADB's administration fee, audit cost, bank charges, and provision for foreign exchange \nfluctuations (if any), to the extent that these items are not covered by the interest and investment income earned on \nthis grant, or any additional grant contribution by the European Commission. \n ", "10 \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nAmount  Share \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank  15.00  62.50 \nGovernment of Australiaa  4.50  18.75 \nEuropean Commission  3.34b  13.92 \nGovernment of Solomon Islands  1.16  4.83 \n    Total   24.00  100.00 \na  Through  the  Memorandum  of  Understanding  on  Channel  Financing  (Technical \nAssistance Program) between the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia \nand the Asian Development Bank.

The current project steering committee \nwill guide and monitor all aspects of project implementation, including (i) policy guidance and \ncoordination, (ii) subproject feasibility study and selection, (iii) project progress reports and other \nproject documentation, (iv) annual reports on road maintenance budgets and activities, and \n(v) audited accounts and financial statements.13 A PMU will be established in MID to coordinate \nand implement the project. The permanent secretary of MID will be responsible for overall \nproject management. The permanent secretary will assign a project coordinator to provide \nliaison with the PMU in the implementation of the project.14 Given MID\u2019s limited technical staff \nresources, a consulting firm will be hired for these services (paras. 31 and 33). A professionally \nqualified civil engineer with appropriate road project management experience will be responsible \nfor project management and day-to-day implementation of project activities, with the support of \ntechnical, accounting and finance, and administrative staff.  \n \n41.  The PMU will (i) conduct subproject feasibility documentation, design, and supervision; \n(ii) manage the bidding; (iii) manage contracts; (iv) prepare withdrawal applications; (v) prepare \nproject progress reports and a project completion report; (vi) maintain project accounts and \ncomplete grant financial records for auditing; (vii) monitor the project\u2019s socioeconomic impact; \n(viii) train MID staff and build their project implementation capacity; and (ix) complete the related \nproject management activities as necessary to implement the project successfully and comply \nwith ADB policies and guidelines. \n  \n                                                 \n13  The first project steering committee was established under the Post-Conflict Emergency Rehabilitation Project. \nADB. 2000.

The project will be implemented over 2.5 years. The recruitment of the PMU consultants \nhas begun under advance action and will be completed by the end of October 2009. Other \npreparatory activities for the initial works\u2014including feasibility studies, detailed design, tender \ndocumentation, award of contract, and mobilization\u2014will be completed by December 2009. \nRehabilitation activities will begin soon after mobilization in October 2009, and will be physically \ncompleted by the end of September 2011. The grant is scheduled to close by the end of March \n2012. This time frame takes into account the wet season and appropriate construction periods \nfor remote locations. Capacity development and the community awareness program will be \nundertaken over the entire project period (2009\u20132011). The implementation schedule for the \nproject is in Appendix 8. \n3.  Procurement \n43.  The  procurement  of  all  packages  under  the  project  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and the Government\u2019s procurement systems \nwhere appropriate. The procurement systems of the Government, such as the ministerial and \ncentral tender boards, will be strengthened, particularly in strict compliance with bid documents. \nHence, for example, tender board meetings for the bid opening must be convened on the date \nand time specified in the bid documents, provisions regarding the acceptance and opening of \nlate bids must be followed, and all tender board members or their representatives must be in the \ncountry for the bid opening.15 ADB\u2019s prior approval will be required for contract awards above \nthe  threshold  amounts  indicated  below  and  in  the  procurement  plan.  Two  major  contract \npackages for the Makira and Guadalcanal subprojects will be procured through international \ncompetitive bidding (ICB). ICB activities will primarily apply to major structural works (bridges, \nriver  training,  road  approaches  and  protection  works,  sealed  road).  Road  pavement  and \ndrainage improvements on existing gravel roads will be procured through national competitive \nbidding, through shopping, or, for small-scale contracts, through community participation in \nprocurement. ICB procedures will be used for civil works contracts of more than $1,000,000 and \ncontracts for goods valued at more than $500,000. National competitive bidding will be used for \ncivil works contracts of more than $100,000 and up to $1,000,000, and for contracts for goods \nvalued  at  more  than  $100,000  and  up  to  $500,000.  Shopping  procedures  or  community \nparticipation will apply to contracts up to $100,000. The evaluation of the ICB contract will \ninclude a margin of preference for national contractors. The procurement plan is in Appendix 9. \n4.  Consulting Services \n44.  A total of 53 person-months of international consulting services and 158 person-months \nof national consulting services will be required for the project. The services will cover (i) project \nmanagement;  (ii) institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  development;  and  (iii)  feasibility \nstudies, detailed engineering design, and implementation supervision. A separate contract for \nconsulting services for about 18 person-months will be required for the HIV education and \nawareness campaign. \n \n45.  All consultants for the project will be recruited according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time), through quality- and cost-based selection \n(at  a  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  80:20)  based  on  simplified  technical  proposals,  except  for  the \n                                                 \n15  Experience has shown that bids are not always opened on the specified dates and times; late bids are accepted, \nopened, publicly read out, and considered for bid evaluation; and bid opening dates have to be postponed at times \nbecause the members of tender boards are out of the country. \n ", "12 \nconsultants for the HIV education and awareness program, who will be hired through single-\nsource selection.16 At the request of the Government, ADB will select the consultants on behalf \nof  MID,  which  will  then  hire  the  selected  consultants.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  the \nconsulting services are in Appendix 10. \n5.  Advance Action \n46.  The physical works will start in January 2010. The presence of the resident engineer on \nsite will be critical. Some of the detailed engineering designs for the Guadalcanal subproject will \nnot be completed under the TA (footnote 4) and will have to be completed in time for the calling \nof bids in January 2010. In addition, the feasibility assessments for the Malaita subproject need \nto begin in January 2010. To avoid delays in implementation, the Government has requested \nadvance action for the recruitment of the consultants. The Government has been advised that \nthe approval of advance action, if granted, does not commit ADB to provide funds for the \nproject.  \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n47.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  MID.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the project. To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \ngrant regulations and the bidding documents for the project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of MID and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, \nand other service providers as they relate to the project. \n \n48.  To ensure transparency and good governance, MID will publicly disclose the use of the \ngrant proceeds on the Government\u2019s website. For each procurement contract, MID will disclose \n(i) the list of participating bidders, (ii) the name of the winning bidder, (iii) basic details on the \nbidding procedure adopted, (iv) the amount of the contract award, (v) the list of goods or \nservices purchased, and (vi) the intended and the actual amount of grant proceeds under each \ncontract. MID will see to it that all of its consultants, contractors, and staff are fully aware of and \ncomply with the procedures of the Government and ADB, including those for implementation, \nprocurement,  use  of  consultants,  disbursements,  reporting,  and  prevention  of  fraud  and \ncorruption. \n7.  Grievance and Redress Mechanism \n49.  A  procedure  for  managing  complaints  and  problems  will  be  established  by  MID  to \n(i) review and redress grievances of project stakeholders in relation to the project, any service \nprovider, or any person responsible for carrying out the project; and (ii) set the threshold criteria \nand procedures for handling such grievances, for proactively addressing them, and for notifying \nstakeholders about the mechanism or course of action chosen. \n                                                 \n16  Under SIRIP, Save the Children Australia hired the local nongovernment organization Nexus through single-source \nselection method to provide consulting services for HIV, with the approval of ADB\u2019s Central Operations Services \nOffice. \n ", "13 \n8.  Disbursement Arrangements \n50.  The grant proceeds will be disbursed through direct payment, according to ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). For small, community-based \ncontracts, 20%\u201325% of the contract value will be paid up front to contractors with limited \nfinancial capacity to ensure that they have sufficient working capital to pay their workers. The \nadvance will be progressively deducted from their direct-payment claims.  \n9.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n51.  MID  will  make  satisfactory  arrangements  for  the  reporting  of  progress  in  project \nimplementation. With the assistance of the PMU, MID will submit to ADB quarterly progress \nreports on pre-construction activities and the construction of civil works, including (i) physical \nand financial progress, (ii) the status of land acquisition and resettlement (if required), (iii) \nenvironmental  management,  (iv)  institutional  development  and  capacity  building,  (v)  public \ncommunication  campaigns,  and  (vi)  other  activities  critical  to  project  implementation.  To \nfacilitate  performance  monitoring  and  post-project  review,  the  Government  has  agreed  to \nprovide ADB, within 3 months of the physical completion of the project, a completion report that \nwill cover implementation details, costs, and benefits, and any other information that ADB might \nrequire.  The  Government  will  also  provide  annual  reports  on  road  maintenance  budgets, \nactivities, and expenditures, and will submit annual audited financial statements, audited project \naccounts, audit reports, management letters, and other related statements to ADB no later than \n6 months after the end of each fiscal year throughout the implementation period. ADB will issue \na formal warning for audited accounts that are 6 months overdue and suspend disbursement for \naccounts that are 12 months overdue. \n \n52.  MID will maintain separate records and accounts identifying the goods and services \nfinanced from the grant, the expenditures incurred for the project, and the use of counterpart \nfunds. The project accounts will be established and maintained according to sound accounting \nprinciples and practices consistent with internationally accepted accounting standards. External \nauditors acceptable to ADB will audit the project accounts and annual financial statements every \nyear. The audit reports will include an auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the grant proceeds and \ncompliance with the financial covenants in the grant agreement. \n10.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n53.  Within 6 months of grant effectiveness, MID with the assistance of PMU will establish a \nproject performance and monitoring system. ADB and the Government, in consultation with the \nproject\u2019s development partners, will agree on a set of indicators for monitoring and evaluating \nhow well the project achieves its goals and purposes. These indicators will be refined and \nmonitored  during  project  implementation.  The  indicators  will  include  data  for  monitoring \neconomic  development,  transport  sector  performance,  socioeconomic  development, \nenvironmental impact, maintenance, and institutional development. Monitoring and evaluation \nwill be based on gender-disaggregated data for social and poverty impact indicators. The PMU \nwill provide hands-on training in data collection, monitoring, and evaluation to the national \nconsultants and TPPU staff. This will allow monitoring to be maintained in the future. MID with \nassistance of PMU shall monitor and evaluate the indicators according to the agreed framework \non a quarterly basis to determine the efficiency and effectiveness of the Project and submit \nthem  to  ADB  through  the  quarterly  progress  reports.  Guidelines  for  baseline  values  for \nsubprojects, data collection and analysis, and future monitoring periods are in Appendix 11. \n ", "14 \n11.  Project Review \n54.  ADB and the Government will undertake semiannual reviews of the project, in which with \nAusAID and the European Commission have been invited to participate, to consider in detail the \n(i) scope of the project, (ii) implementation arrangements, (iii) compliance with grant covenants, \n(iv)  physical  achievements  against  targets  and  milestones,  and  (v)  project  implementation \nissues requiring resolution or action. The midterm review will be made within 12 months of the \ngrant effectiveness date. The midterm review will examine in detail the implementation progress \nand project design (institutional, administrative, organizational, technical, environmental, social, \npoverty reduction, resettlement, economic, and financial aspects), and identify courses of action \nthat would improve project performance, viability, and the achievement of targets and project \nobjectives. All the assumptions and risks noted in the design and monitoring framework will be \nreviewed.  \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACT, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Expected Benefits and Impacts \n1.  Project Economic Justification \n55.  Two sample subprojects have been assessed. The estimated EIRR of the Guadalcanal \nsubproject is 42%, reflecting the central importance of restoring this main transport route to the \nnational economy.  The financial costs and economic evaluation of the Makira subproject, based \non the final detailed design cost estimate of $18.0 million, have been submitted. The economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated to be 11.3%, marginally lower than the standard \nhurdle rate but still acceptable, given the post-conflict status and weak performance of the \ncountry, and its need for economic stimulus and investment.17 Considering that some input \nparameters have been estimated conservatively and that a number of project benefits have not \nbeen quantified, sensitivity analysis shows the subproject to be reasonably robust to variations \nin input. The most sensitive variable is the construction cost, but the receipt of tenders before \nproject  approval  will  allow  this  risk  to  be  closely  managed.  The  EIRR  is  detailed  in \nSupplementary Appendix E. \n \n \n2.  Expected Economic Benefits \n56.  In the case of Makira subproject, a total of 12,100 people will benefit from the improved \naccess. Economic benefits from the Makira subproject arise from (i) savings in time for people \nand goods transferring from foot and small boat to motorized land transport; (ii) improvements in \nhealth status for residents of villages newly accessible by road and reduction in accidental \nfatalities, mainly through drowning, by providing safe water crossings and associated property \nlosses; (iii) income generation from stimulated agricultural production and commercial transport \nservices; and  (iv) net increase in revenue to transport operators (increase to road transport net \nof losses to coastal vessel operators).  \n \n                                                 \n17 ADB. 2007. Achieving Development Effectiveness in Weakly Performing Countries (The ADB\u2019s Approach to \nEngaging with Weakly Performing Countries). Manila. Para. 49(i) stipulates: Programs and projects in weakly \nperforming countries should not be expected to always yield the same financial and economic rates of return as \nwould be expected in stronger-performing developing member countries. If ADB wishes to continue to provide \ndevelopment assistance to weakly performing countries, it must recognize that the financial and economic risks of \ninvestments are higher and that lower returns are likely. \n ", "15 \n57.  For the Guadalcanal subproject, the traffic volume measured at five locations along the \nroad section varies from 450 to 2,100 vehicles/day. Travel time savings from upgrading of the \nroad surface and ease of negotiation of water crossings was estimated from trip times before \nand after the February floods. A 15 minute increase in travel time over the route was found to \nhave occurred and this will be recovered with the rehabilitation and upgrading works. \n \n58.  The economic costs of disruption from prolonged route closures have been estimated in \ncategories of (i) loss of opportunity to market cash crops from the catchment area of the road. \nThese are copra, cocoa, betelnut, fish, and fresh fruits; (ii) loss of income for wage employees \ntravelling to work; (iii) loss of revenue to public transport services. These losses have been \nestimated only for travel from the communities served into Honiara, on the basis that this forms \nthe major focus for marketing produce and wage employment. \n \n59.  In the case of Guadalcanal subproject, a total of 29,000 people will benefit from the \nimproved access. The economic benefit estimates are regarded as conservative as a number of \neffects have been left unquantified, as the quantified benefits already provided more than \nsufficient economic justification for the selected subproject option. Unquantified benefits were \nassessed using a simple multi-criteria analysis to supplement the EIRR with factors of (i) mode \nswitching to or from coastal boat or foot; (ii) road safety costs; (iii) induced economic demand \nthrough service improvements and greater route reliability.  \n \n3.  Poverty Reduction Impact \n60.  The Project will reduce poverty by improving people\u2019s access to local and provincial \nmarkets, agricultural fields, water supplies, and firewood, thereby offering income generation \nopportunities. The Project also will reduce poverty by offering direct employment on the project \nthrough  labor-intensive  contracts.  During  implementation,  employment  will  be  created  in \nrehabilitation and maintenance for civil works. Following completion, employment opportunities \nwill arise for routine maintenance conduced through LBES and traditional methods. By reducing \nthe cost and time of travel, inducing economic activities, and employing people directly, the \nProject will improve people\u2019s incomes, living standards and food security. A summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 12. \n \n4.  Social Impacts \n61.  Positive social impacts include improved access to education facilities, which will help \nraise school enrolment and retention rates, and improved access to health services, which will \npromote more frequent use and facilitate rapid care during medical emergencies. Other social \nbenefits include easier access to administrative and service centers, including communication \nfacilities. Potential adverse impacts include hazards to pedestrians, particularly from increased \nand  faster  traffic  flows  brought  about  by  road  rehabilitation.  These  risks  will  be  managed \nthrough the government's road safety program. Potential adverse impacts include hazards to \npedestrians,  particularly  from  increased  and  faster  traffic  flows  brought  about  by  road \nrehabilitation. These risks will be managed through the government's road safety program.  \n \n62.  Gender-Inclusive Development. Poverty and social analysis at the subproject level will \nbe gender-disaggregated. It will take into account (i) the differential project impacts and risks \nfacing women, (ii) gender-specific measures to mitigate adverse impacts and manage risks, and \n(iii) the interests and capacities of women to contribute to road rehabilitation and maintenance. \nThe  Project  will  be  proactive  in  ensuring  women\u2019s  involvement  in  road  rehabilitation  and \nmaintenance, HIV prevention, and the road safety activities. Women will directly benefit from the \n ", "16 \nProject  in  terms  of  their  participation  in  LBES  contracts.  The  Project  will  also  encourage, \npromote and train female contractors as has been done under ongoing projects.  \n \n63.  Public Health Issues. While the reported number of infections remains low, Solomon \nIslands  is  vulnerable  to  HIV.  Risk  factors  include  the  prevalence  of  sexually  transmitted \ninfections, teenage pregnancy, gender inequality and violence against women, recent violent \nsocial  conflict,  and  cultural  and  religious  factors.  Transport  systems  and  infrastructure \ndevelopment are recognized internationally as a vector for HIV transmission. However, these \nrisks are small due to low population densities and short travel distances that do not require \novernight  stops  by  service  providers  or  travelers.  Several  HIV  prevention  and  treatment \nprograms and projects are active in the Pacific region and Solomon Islands.  HIV education and \nprevention has been integrated into SIRIP (para. 37) and will be extended into the Project. \n \n 64.  Stakeholder  Participation  and  Consultation.  Stakeholder  consultations  were \nundertaken during the original design of the Makira subproject in 2006. Consultations with \ndirectly  affected  persons  have  been  ongoing  during  the  feasibility  and  tender  preparation \nphases,  with  memorandums  of  understanding  concluded  with  interested  groups.  On \nGuadalcanal, the feasibility studies have recently been completed. Design solutions for river \ncrossings or structures have been determined utilizing the same consultative process as has \nbeen  undertaken  on  Makira  subproject.  Poverty  and  social  surveys  together  with  public \nconsultations and other baseline surveys have been conducted. The form and purpose of the \nProject  has  not  changed  from  that  originally  intended  and  these  improvements  are  well \nunderstood by the communities, as reflected in their willingness to assist in implementation \nwherever possible. \n \n65.  In  accordance  with  the  grant  covenants  of  SIRIP,  the  PMCBU  consultants  have \ndeveloped and implemented a communications program to ensure that all affected communities \nand civil works contractors engaged under the SIRIP participate in an HIV prevention program. \nNational Aids Council (NAC) approved provider, Save the Children Australia (SCA), and a \nnational partner NGO (Nexus) have been engaged to manage the provision to all affected \ncommunities of awareness relating to crosscutting issues including HIV, sexually transmitted \ninfections  (STI)  and  the  protection  of  children  and  women.  The  HIV  program  has  been \ndeveloped in coordination with NAC and Ministry for Health and includes the distribution of \nprinted materials to communities to ensure the messages and information are available for \ndiscussion post awareness. The program has been implemented in Makira, Temotu, Malaita \nand Guadalcanal and will be extended to the Guadalcanal flood damaged subproject. Specific \nprovisions aimed at mitigating the risk of HIV are included in bidding documents for civil works \ncontracts involving construction campsites with foreign workers, and the PMCBU will be strictly \nmonitoring compliance once implementation is underway. All awareness workshops have a \ncommon core curricula dealing with a wide range environmental, economic and social issues \nincluding (i) prevention of STIs and HIV, (ii) prevention of exploitation of women and children, \n(iii)  mitigation  of  human,  environmental  and  biological  degradation,  (iv)  road  safety,  (v) \nemployment  and  income  generation  activities,  and  (vi)  responsibilities  of  contractors.  The \ninformation,  education  and  communication  material  covering  the  various  aspects  of  the \ncommunity education awareness programs were distributed in affected communities. Specific \nseparate sessions are conducted with women. \n \n66.  Resettlement  Impacts.  Besides  4.5  km  of  new  road  in  Makira  subporoject,  the \nrehabilitation subprojects are not expected to require resettlement or land acquisition, as most \nof  the  works  will  be  undertaken  on  existing roads  within  existing  rights-of-way.  The  exact \namount of land to be acquired for the 4.5 km length will not be made known until the final \n ", "17 \ndesigns are completed. Ressettlement due diligence reports have been prepared for Makira and \nGuadalcanal  subprojects.  In  the  event  of  any  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  needs,  the \nGovernment will inform ADB and prepare a resettlement plan according to relevant laws and \nregulations; ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995); and the resettlement framework. \nThe PMU will ensure that no construction activities begin until ADB has reviewed and approved \nsuch resettlement plan. \n \n67.  Indigenous  People.  Native  Melanesians,  who  comprise  the  vast  majority  of  the \npopulation, are the indigenous people of Solomon Islands. For the indigenous population, the \nrehabilitation  subprojects  will  improve  access  to  health,  education,  livelihood,  and  social \nservices. The Project is not expected to have a negative impact on indigenous peoples that \nwould trigger ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998).  \n \n5.  Environmental Impacts \n68.  The Project is classified as environmental category B according to ADB\u2019s Environment \nPolicy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). All road improvement activities \nwill be confined to existing rights-of-way, except for 4.5 km of new road on Makira subproject \nwhere land acquisition will be required. IEEs have been conducted for Makira and Guadalcanal \nsubprojects to develop the methodology for environmental assessment of subprojects, as well \nas  an  environmental  assessment  review  process  (EARP).  The  IEE  findings  support  the \nclassification of the Project as category B. A summary initial environmental examination (IEE) of \nthe sector project, prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines, is \nin Supplementary Appendix F. ADB\u2019s assessment procedure is aligned with the environmental \nimpact assessment requirements of the Government\u2019s Environment Act (1998).  \n \n69.  Each subproject will be subject to an IEE, which will include a detailed, site-specific EMP \nprepared under the responsibility of the PMU. The EMP will specify the required mitigation \nmeasures  and  monitoring  activities  to  ensure their  effectiveness.  Subproject  environmental \nselection criteria will ensure that the Project will not harm any ecologically or culturally sensitive \nareas.  The  construction  of  improved  drainage  structures,  stabilization  of  slopes  through \nbioengineering, and other measures undertaken by the Project will have long-term beneficial \nimpacts on the environment. Short-term impacts will be unavoidable during construction. These \nmight include noise, dust, and other temporary impacts, such as loss of vegetation due to earth \nmoving, and minor sedimentation of waterways and the coastal environment near the shore. \nThese impacts will end with the completion of rehabilitation works, and methods specified in the \nenvironmental  management  plan  (EMP)  will  mitigate  them.  Adherence  to  best  engineering \npractices during rehabilitation, and strict enforcement of the EMP, will avoid or adequately \nmitigate all of the rehabilitation-related impacts. Each subproject will be subject to an IEE, which \nwill include a detailed, site-specific EMP prepared under the responsibility of the PMU. The EMP \nwill  specify  the  required  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring  activities  to  ensure  their \neffectiveness \n   \n6.  Policy and Institutional Improvements  \n70.  The  road  sector  institutional  development  component  supported  by  the  Project  will \nadvance the objectives of Government policy in improving the efficiency of public services \ndelivery. It also will create participation opportunities for the private sector contracting industry \nthrough performance-based maintenance contracts, as well as smaller LBES construction and \nrehabilitation packages. \n \n ", "18 \nB.  Risks \n1.  Technical Risks \n71.  The design of bridges at the larger river crossings mitigates against the risk of flood \ndamage even from a 50-year flood, and achieves an appropriate balance between the cost of \nreinstatement, disruption consequences, and construction cost. Other structures are designed \nto minimize the risks of scouring and washouts. Site investigations have been limited to surface \nobservation and surveys; drilling to establish foundation conditions for bridge structures will be \nundertaken at the start of implementation. There is some technical risk that adverse foundation \nconditions could require deeper piling than estimated or reconsideration of the design solution \nor increased cost. The road alongside the flood plains will be raised and sealed with bitumen to \nprevent  the  erosion  of  pavement  materials  during  floods.  The  sections  of  road  lengths \nencountering a high water table will be raised with improved drainage. This risk is mitigated by \nan allowance for risk contingencies within the base cost estimate. \n \n2.  Social and Resettlement Risks \n72.  Social aspects were considered during SIRIP formulation and subproject approval. Initial \npoverty and social assessments (IPSAs) have been prepared for the two core subprojects, and \nthe IPSA for the Makira subproject has been accepted as final. The IPSAs are in Supplementary \nAppendixes G and H. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy, which takes into \naccount the achievements of SIRIP to date and the findings of the IPSAs, is in Appendix 12. A \nresettlement framework for the project and due-diligence reports in respect of resettlement \nissues for the two core subprojects have been prepared and are in Supplementary Appendixes I \nto K.  \n \n73.  The  changes  in  the  configuration  of  structures  in  the  Makira  subproject  since  the \npreparation of the original IPSA will not have a negative effect on social aspects; therefore, no \nfurther analysis and screening are required. Out of the 72.5 km length of road, land will be \nrequired  for  the  Makira  subproject  over  4.5  km  of  new  route  sections  for  three  relocated \nwatercourse crossings. Landowners have signed memorandums of understanding with MID \nover the full length, agreeing to the use of their land for road in exchange for the benefits \nprovided by the new bridge crossings. The land along the 4.5 km of road is undeveloped and \ndoes not contain houses, other buildings, agricultural plots, or cultivated trees. A resettlement \ndue diligence report has been prepared for the subproject and a short resettlement plan will be \nprepared during the final detailed design in accordance with existing resettlement framework. In \nthe case of the Makira subproject, the realization of the social benefits from improved access \nassumes  that  the  villagers  and  transport  operators  will  buy  vehicles  and  set  up  transport \nservices once the road connectivity is established. The responses during the consultation give \nconfidence  that  this  will  occur.  The  relocation  of  the  three  river  crossings  in  the  Makira \nsubproject assumes that the villagers who have signed memorandums of understanding with \nMID will honor their agreement to provide land as a contribution to the subproject. \n \n74.  Risks common to all rehabilitation subprojects will be addressed through the stakeholder \nconsultation plans. The mitigation measures include (i) the prevention of conflicts between local \npeople and contractors; (ii) road safety education by the provincial police and local NGOs; and \n(iii) an HIV awareness campaign in villages with the involvement of a specialized NGO and the \nprovincial Department of Health. A campaign to raise awareness will also be waged to maximize \nthe  benefits  from  the  subprojects.  All  awareness-building  activities  will  involve  local  and \ninternational NGOs working in the province, and provincial government agencies. \n ", "19 \n \n75.  The expected impact on indigenous peoples puts the project in category B. Landowners \naffected by the project are indigenous people, and favorable actions are set out in the IPSAs \n(Supplementary Appendixes G and H), the summary poverty reduction and social strategy \n(Appendix 12), and the resettlement framework (Supplementary Appendix I). \n \n3.  Materials Acquisition \n76.  Local landowners in Solomon Islands commonly grant access to pavement materials as \ntheir counterpart contribution. Clear government and development partner policies regarding \ncounterpart contributions mitigate the risk of demands for compensation. Landowners confirmed \ntheir willingness to contribute in consultations during subproject preparation, and have signed \nmemorandums of understanding to that effect with MID. If required, MID will lease quarries and \nriver gravel sites for pavement materials and borrow pits at various locations within Solomon \nIslands, and grant royalties in adequate compensation for materials extracted from these sites. \n \n4.  Post-Conflict Environment  \n77.  While  the  post-conflict  environment  is  stable,  the  economy  has  not  recovered \nsubstantially and is adversely affected by the current global economic financial crisis. The \nbusiness  environment,  however,  is  increasingly  positive,  as  contractors  and  consultants \nrespond to business opportunities. If political instability increases or there is a deterioration in \nlaw and order, reduced interest in the project among prospective bidders could increase tender \nprices  and  lessen  community  support  for  the  project.  Continuing  large-scale,  long-term \nassistance from development partners in the economic and post-conflict recovery efforts of the \nGovernment will mitigate this risk. \n \n5.  Financial Risks \n78.  Government counterpart contributions, particularly where cash payments are required \nfor rehabilitation, road maintenance, and counterpart staff could be inadequate because of the \nongoing  impact  of  the  global  economic  and financial  crisis, despite  assurances.  The  risks \nrelated  to  government  counterpart  financing  will  be  mitigated  by:  (i) the  relatively  small \nproportion of government financing (4.83%) limits the effects on project objectives of any delay \nor reduction in the contribution; (ii) the ADB-supported full operation of the NTF provides a \nsecure channel of financing for road maintenance; and (iii) the inclusion of taxes on fuel and \nplant inputs (but not gross sales tax) in project cost allows shortfalls in the Government\u2019s cash \ncontribution to be covered by a tax credit against tax components of the construction cost. The \ncounterpart contributions are relatively small in amount, and are within MID\u2019s ability to manage \nthrough the annual budget cycle. \n \n79.  The state of the construction market, the relative remoteness of the subprojects, and the \nvolatility of exchange rates and unit costs of construction input create a financial risk up to the \npoint of receipt and acceptance of construction tenders. This risk can be partially mitigated by \ncalling  for  tenders  in  advance  of  project  approval,  providing  an  opportunity  to  adjust  the \nsubproject  scope  and  design  if  necessary.  The  early  tendering  of  all  the  rehabilitation \ncomponents will also mitigate the risks of inflationary effects over the term of the project.  \n \n80.  Adequate  financial  management  skills  within  MID,  supported  by  the  PMU,  will  be \nimportant for the achievement of the project\u2019s objectives and the long-term sustainability of its \nimpact. A financial management assessment found a significant improvement in procedures and \n ", "20 \naffirmed  the  contribution  of  the  financial  management  system  put  in  place  by  the  project \nmanagement and capacity building unit established under SIRIP. \n \n6.  Environmental Impact Risks \n81.  Subproject approval processes are part of the environmental assessment and review \nprocedure set out in Supplementary Appendix A. The initial environmental examination (IEE) for \nthe Makira core subproject (Supplementary Appendix B) posted on ADB\u2019s website has been \naccepted. Another IEE, for the Guadalcanal subproject (Supplementary Appendix C), concluded \nthat the environmental impact will be minimal and can be readily mitigated. The Guadalcanal \nsubproject is in a coastal area where coconut and cocoa plantations are interspersed with \nsubsistence gardens and regenerating scrubland. There are no protected areas or community-\nbased marine protected areas in the subproject area. The Guadalcanal subproject will involve \nthe  repair  and  rehabilitation  of  culverts,  scour  protection,  river  training  works,  and  the \nreconstruction or repair of bridges, all within existing rights-of-way, and no land acquisition or \nresettlement will be required.  \n \n7.  Institutional Risks \n82.  The sustainability of the Project hinges on the availability of dedicated funding for road \nmaintenance  and  investment,  supplied  through  the  NTF.  The  NTF  Act  was  passed  by \nParliament in 2008 and operational regulations are now being finalized. In the interim, MID \nprovides maintenance funding through a dedicated budget line item. \n \n83.  Continued progress in restructuring MID and developing its management systems to \ntransform the ministry into a planning and asset management agency depends on the continued \nsuccess of reforms under ADB TA and adequate government funding. One risk is that the \nGovernment\u2019s commitment to reform, and the associated development and implementation of \noperating and management procedures, could wane. Resource shortages within MID present a \nfurther risk. The project will mitigate these risks through close collaboration and cooperation with \nthe ongoing TA, involving consultations between the Government, the private sector, and the \ngeneral public (footnote 7). ADB project and TA review missions, as well as country consultation \nmissions,  will  engage  in  regular  dialogue  with  stakeholders  to  maintain  support  and \ncommitment.  \n \n84.  ADB will continue to work closely with development partners to promote improvements \nin  sector  governance,  including  an  operational  NTF  providing  sustainable  funding  for \ninfrastructure  maintenance,  program  and  contract  management  capability  within  MID,  and \nprivate sector contracting capacity, with support from the PMU.  \n \n8.  Climate Change Risks \n85.  Climate change effects in the South Pacific include a probable increase in the frequency \nand severity of tropical storms and in the associated rainfall intensity, duration, and flood risk. \nLogging in stream catchments reduces the concentration time and increases debris loads. The \nproject  will  mitigate  climate  change  risks  to  the  rehabilitation  subprojects  by  funding \nclimate change\u2013resistant designs for watercourse crossings, reducing the risk that large flood \nevents will destroy critical infrastructure, severing road links with uncertain priority, and timing \nrestoration  projects.  Climate  change  adaptation  measures  are  detailed  in  Supplementary \nAppendix D. \n \n ", "21 \n9.  Overall Assessment \n86.  The core road rehabilitation subprojects are subject to technical risks that are largely \nwithin the control of MID through the PMU. These risks can be satisfactorily mitigated through \nsound project management and supervision. The design provides for the mitigation of climate \nchange risk. The financial risks in regard to securing parallel financing and the Government\u2019s \ncounterpart contribution can be mitigated. The financial risks involved in any variance between \nthe tendered contract prices and the design estimate will be known by the time the project is \napproved. The environmental risks are minor and capable of mitigation. The social effects\u2014the \nbenefits  of  new  and  restored  access\u2014are  largely  positive.  Strict  measures  to  control  the \nadverse impact of construction on local communities including HIV control are, or will be, put in \nplace. Overall, the benefits of applying the additional resources required to complete the project \nare expected to greatly outweigh the costs, given the recognized risks and mitigation strategy. \nOverall, the risks are sufficiently manageable and do not constitute any barriers to project \napproval. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES  \nA.  Specific Assurances \n87.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  MID  have  given  the \nfollowing assurances in respect of the project, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Land acquisition and resettlement. In the event of any land acquisition or \nresettlement needs, the Government will inform ADB and prepare a resettlement \nplan according to relevant laws and regulations; ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement \nPolicy (1995); and the resettlement framework. The PMU will ensure that no \nconstruction  activities  begin  until  ADB  has  reviewed  and  approved  such \nresettlement plan. \n \n(ii)  Environment.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  no  subproject  assessed  as \ncategory A (significant adverse impact) will be approved under the project. The \nGovernment, through the PMU, will ensure that (a) the IEE and the preliminary \nenvironmental  management  plan  (EMP)  are  reviewed  and  updated  at  the \nengineering design stage; (b) each subproject complies with the EMP reflected in \nthe updated IEE, all applicable national environmental laws, regulations, and \nguidelines, and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002); (c) the EMP is reflected as \npart  of  bidding  documents  and  civil  works  contracts;  (d)  any  adverse \nenvironmental  impact  arising  from  the  project  is  minimized  through  the \nimplementation of the agreed mitigating measures; (e) environmental monitoring \nis  done  by  the  PMU  and  the  contractors;  and  (f)  the  required  EARP  are \nimplemented.  Further,  the  Ministry  of  Environment,  Conservation  and \nMeteorology (MECM) will identify a single point of contact within its environment \nunit for the project; MECM will take steps to expedite the processing of the \nGuadalcanal  subproject,  for  which  an  IEE  has  also  been  lodged,  and  all \nsubsequent subprojects. \n \n(iii)  Gender and employment. MID will (a) require project contractors to employ a \nminimum of 33% women in road rehabilitation and labor-intensive maintenance \nof selected national roads; (b) provide equal pay to men and women for work of \nequal type, in accordance with national laws and international treaty obligations \n ", "22 \nand to pay women's wages directly to them; (c) provide safe working conditions \nfor male and female workers; (d) ensure that at least 20% of road maintenance \ncontractors  are  women;  and  (e)  ensure  that  project  contractors  comply  with \napplicable labor laws and abstain from using child labor. Specific provisions to \nthis effect will be included in the bidding documents. The PMU will be responsible \nfor monitoring the employment targets for women by reviewing periodically the \npayroll statements of the construction contractors, and will reflect progress in \nachieving the employment targets for women in the project progress reports and \nproject completion report. \n \n(iv)  Health risks. MID will ensure that all civil works contractors engaged under the \nproject participate in an HIV prevention program in construction campsites to be \nfunded under the project. The PMU will ensure that similar information on the risk \nof transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases is disseminated to \nlocal communities in the corridor of project influence, in coordination with national \nagencies working on this issue. The PMU will include specific provisions to this \neffect in civil works contracts, and will strictly monitor compliance. \n \n(v)  Project performance monitoring and evaluation. Within 6 months of the grant \neffectiveness  date,  MID  shall  finalize  and  adopt  a  project  performance  and \nmonitoring  system  acceptable  to  ADB,  based  on  indicators  and  procedures \nagreed on between the Government and ADB.

Road Network \n1.  Solomon  Islands  has  a  road  network  of  about  1,950  kilometers  (km)  spread  over \n30 islands. The network comprises 220 km of main roads, 480 km of secondary roads, 850 km \nof provincial roads, 150 km of Honiara town roads, and about 250 km of private and plantation \naccess roads. The country has an estimated 800 km of logging roads. The road network also \nhas about 200 bridges and is linked by 120 wharves. Sea is the dominant mode of transport in \nSolomon Islands. The Ministry of Infrastructure and Development (MID) manages all roads \ncomprising main, secondary, provincial, and urban roads. \n \n2.  About  60%  of  the  network  (excluding  Honiara  town  roads)  is  on  Guadalcanal  and \nMalaita, which serve about 90% of the traffic in the country. About 1,570 km have a graveled \nsurface and about 100 km of main roads, mostly on Guadalcanal and Malaita, and 50 km of \nHoniara town roads are sealed. Other provinces have relatively short coastal segments of \ngravel or earth roads around provincial centers. Compared with other Pacific island countries, \nthe road density is low: Solomon Islands has less than 0.07 km of road per square kilometer, \nand only 0.005 km per capita. About 23% of villages are accessible by road (normally by cars or \ntrucks), 32% by sea, 40% by walking tracks, and 5% by river. \n \n3.  The  main  roads  serve  the  densely  populated  areas  linking  the  main  centers  with \ncommercial centers, markets, and main ports. The secondary roads are extensions to the main \nroad network, or serve provincial and subprovincial centers and rural communities on the main \nislands.  Provincial  roads  serve  a  similar  function  to  secondary  roads.  They  also  connect \nagricultural areas and villages to wharves, and provide access to social services, including \nschools, clinics, and markets. \n \n4.  Apart from the donor-funded road programs, the main, secondary, and provincial roads \nwere not built to appropriate standards and have suffered from lack of maintenance over many \nyears.1 Routine maintenance contracts currently exist over 170 km of roads on Guadalcanal, \nTemotu, and Malaita under Solomon Islands Road Improvement (Sector) Project (SIRIP), with \n300 km of roads on Malaita being maintained under force-account arrangements through the \nCommunity Sector Program of the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID). \nAs a result, the rest of the network is in poor condition. It provides inadequate rural access, \nthereby  constraining  economic  growth  and  development,  poverty  reduction,  and  social \ndevelopment.  In  the  rural  areas,  the  potential  for  cash crop  production  is  underdeveloped \nprimarily because of irregular farm-to-market access, which leaves much of the rural population \nreliant on subsistence livelihoods. Resource-based industries also rely on a suitable standard of \nroads to market their production for export. \n \n5.  About 65% of roads (those not being maintained) have deteriorated to such an extent \nthat damage to vehicles that regularly use the roads is common, and the roads are at times \nimpassable  for  cars  and  light  trucks.  Road  surfaces  are  deformed  and  eroded  in  places, \ndrainage is not working properly, and vegetation is overgrown, raising safety concerns. Many \nlog bridges have exceeded their design life, with only about 25% remaining in good condition, \n30% requiring minor repairs, 37% requiring major repairs, and 8% not open to traffic. The poor \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2000.

Manila (Loan 1823/Grant 0043/0044-\nSOL). \n ", "28  Appendix 3 \ncondition of many roads has lowered traveling speeds, while increasing fuel consumption and \nvehicle operating costs. The rough road surfaces have also reduced the economic lives of the \nvehicles, and suppressed road transport demand. \n \n6.  Development partners are assisting with road rehabilitation and bridge works in areas \nworst affected by several years of conflict (1999\u20132003), and with the restoration of some wharf \nfacilities throughout the country. However, much more needs to be done urgently. \nB.  Traffic Volume \n7.  Solomon Islands has about 11,000 vehicles, 90% of which are on Guadalcanal (75% in \nthe capital Honiara), 8% in Malaita, 1% in Western, and the remaining 1% in other provinces. \nPrivate cars and taxis, light trucks, and medium trucks (up to 8 tons, 2 axles) are the dominant \nvehicle types. Larger multi-axle and articulated trucks are rare except in Honiara and specific \nmining and logging areas. The fleet of large trucks in Guadalcanal is forecast to increase \nconsiderably over 2010\u20132015 with the development of mining and oil palm activities. This might \nresult in axle loads of up to 11 tons (dual-wheel) and up to 8 tons on single-wheel axles. \nMotorcycles, motor scooters, and bicycles are not common in Solomon Islands. \n \n8.  The primary causes of road deterioration in Solomon Islands are high rainfall, poor \ndrainage, and lack of maintenance, combined with poor road construction. Maintenance of \ndrains is essential in areas of high rainfall and in steep areas. Heavy axle loads, the primary \ncause of road damage in other countries, are not common in Solomon Islands, except on a few \nmining and logging roads. However, with the increase in heavy vehicles in some areas, the \namount of damage is likely to increase unless roads are properly engineered and constructed \nfor the higher loads, and laws against the overloading of vehicles are enforced. However, the \nexisting Solomon Islands Roads Act, 1955 is outdated and does not adequately address the \noverloading of vehicles. Additionally, MID does not have a law enforcement unit and has no staff \nor budget to monitor vehicle loads and law enforcement. \nC.  Transport Services \n9.  The majority of vehicles in the Solomon Islands are privately owned. Privately owned \nminibuses  and  taxis  are  the  leading  form  of  public  road  transport,  particularly  in  Honiara. \nAvailable public transport is reduced outside Honiara. Public transport in rural areas generally \ntakes the form of light trucks that combine goods and passenger services. Walking is the most \ncommon form of travel for distances up to 10 km. A few small and medium-sized private \noperators provide all the road freight services. In Honiara, a few companies operate heavy and \narticulated trucks, and have container transport capabilities. In addition, private logging trucks \nprovide services to the forestry sector. Although fares are not regulated, market forces ensure \nthey reflect operating costs. \nD.  Road Safety \n10.  Figures obtained from MID show that, on average, six people die in road accidents per \nyear (1996 through 2003). That equates to a rate of five deaths per 10,000 vehicles, relatively \nlow by international standards. The low average speeds and low total distance traveled appear \nto contribute to this low road toll. \n ", "  Appendix 3  29 \nE.  Institutional Framework  \n11.  The institutional framework of MID, which has responsibility for road management, is \nevolving. The former Ministry of Transport, Works and Communications was transformed in \n2001 into MID, which is responsible for the management and development of the national, \nprovincial, and urban road network.  \n \n12.  The MID\u2019s transport planning and policy unit (TPPU) and land transport division have \nrecently been merged into one department, transport infrastructure management services. The \nland transport division is now known as the operation and maintenance division. \n \n13.  TPPU is responsible for policy preparation, planning, and programming of road and \nbridge works, and the operation and maintenance division for their design and implementation. \nTPPU has been restructured to address its responsibilities as a policy and planning unit for all \nmodes of transport infrastructure and to become more focused on asset management. Similarly, \nthe  operation  and  maintenance  division\u2019s  structure  has  been  remodeled  to  suit  the \nimplementation  of  the  policy  of  outsourcing  maintenance  and  capital  works,  and  is  more \ndirected toward asset management.  \n \n14.  Staffing  and  recruitment  have  been  problematic  in  MID,  which  has  been  seeking \nadditional staff to fill vacancies in the revised structure. Further recruitment is planned in 2009 \nand 2010 for both divisions. On-the-job training in planning, programming, budgeting, contract \nmanagement, supervision, quality assurance, and project management is continuing for the staff \nin these two divisions under SIRIP. MID will continue to seek additional staff and make full use \nof training offered by the various technical assistance (TA) projects and under the second-phase \nproject. \nF.  Government Vision and Strategy  \n15.  National Development Plan. The Government\u2019s development vision, mission, priorities, \nand national objectives are articulated in the Medium-Term Development Strategy (MTDS) \n2008\u20132010. The overall national development goal of MTDS is to improve the quality of life and \nliving standards of all the people in Solomon Islands. This goal is to be achieved by ensuring \npeace, harmony, and personal safety among the people; increasing incomes and their equitable \ndistribution; and increasing the availability of, and improving access to, social services for \neveryone. This would lead to equitable distribution of development among all provinces and \npeople within each province, social groups, and genders. The priority areas of MTDS 2008\u2013\n2010 are \n \n(i)  reconciliation and rehabilitation, \n(ii)  national security and foreign relations, \n(iii)  infrastructure development, \n(iv)  social services, \n(v)  economic and productive sectors, and \n(vi)  civic affairs. \n \n16.  The realization of these objectives hinges on increasing personal mobility and removing \nconstraints on the transportation of goods between areas of production and markets. Improving \nnational security requires ensuring that law enforcement officers and justice administrators can \nrespond quickly to emerging threats to peace and order, as and where they occur. Effective, \nefficient, and transparent governance in other areas of government administration similarly \n ", "30  Appendix 3 \nrequires improved access within outlying areas of the country, which is reliant on infrastructure \ndevelopment. Social services, such as basic health and education facilities, as and where they \nare being provided, will be effective only if complementary transport infrastructure and services \nthat are accessible to a higher proportion of the population are developed. Economic growth, \nparticularly in the production and distribution of tradable goods, depends on adequate, reliable, \naffordable, and secure transportation. \n \n17.  Thus, the improvement of transport infrastructure is fundamental to the realization of the \nobjectives of MTDS 2008\u20132010. Transport improvements have an indirect impact on social and \neconomic development, and play a supporting role to the direct components of MTDS 2008\u2013\n2010 in other sectors. Therefore, transport must develop and improve in concert with other \ndevelopments.  \n \n18.  National Transport Policy. National transport policies and strategies are contained in \nthe Transport Sector Strategy. Policies will focus immediately on the rehabilitation of transport \ninfrastructure in areas of most need. In the longer term, the Government\u2019s road subsector policy \nis to \n \n(i)  restore the network of roads and bridges to conditions that promote economic \ndevelopment and enhance social welfare and security;  \n(ii)  extend  the  scope  of  the  maintainable  road  network  in  accordance  with \nsocioeconomic criteria;  \n(iii)  establish an effective and efficient maintenance and asset management system, \nincluding sustainable funding;  \n(iv)  improve the safety, quality, and reliability of transport services;  \n(v)  promote  private  sector  consultation  on  policies  and  works  planning  and \nprogramming;  \n(vi)  promote private sector participation in contracting and service provision;  \n(vii)  encourage appropriate community participation; and  \n(viii)  protect social and environmental standards, and the interests of the socially and \neconomically disadvantaged. \n \n19.  The  Government\u2019s  strategy  is  to  rebuild  high-priority  roads  to  design  standards \nappropriate  to  the  traffic,  topography,  and  climate  adaptation  requirements.  Improvements \nneeded include the repair and replacement of bridges, the reshaping and strengthening of \npavement, and the improvement of drainage (additional culverts and cross drains). Feeder \nroads connecting village settlements and farms with main roads should also be considered for \nimprovement. The Government, through development partners, is  \n \n(i)  rehabilitating high-priority roads and bridges on Guadalcanal, Malaita, and other \nrural provinces; \n(ii)  strengthening the capacity and capability of MID and private consulting sector to \nundertake project management, contract management, contract supervision, and \nroad asset management; and  \n(iii)  establishing a dedicated transport fund with sustainable revenues from road user \ncharges. \n \n20.  The  Government\u2019s  limited  domestic  resources  dictate  that  external  agencies  will \ncontinue to fund most sector development. Similarly, the low capacity and capability of the local \nconstruction industry requires a heavy dependence on international consultants to carry out the \n ", "  Appendix 3  31 \nworks.  Asset  management  capability  is  being  significantly  enhanced,  enabling  follow-up \nmaintenance works to be carried out effectively and efficiently.  \n \n21.  National  Transport  Plan.  The  Transport  Sector  Strategy  is  being  implemented \naccording to the National Transport Plan (NTP). The NTP provides the framework and action \nplan  for  developing  and  maintaining  physical  infrastructure,  facilitating  transport  services, \nimproving the capacity of government agencies, and enhancing private sector participation. The \nNTP, which will be updated every 5 years, is supported by a 3-year rolling work program, which \nis updated annually.  \n \n22.  A national transport task force has been established to assist and advise on key issues \nand development options. The task force comprises representatives of government agencies \nresponsible  for  social  and  economic  planning  and  development,  and  representatives  of \ntransport users and transport service providers. The task force endorsed the NTP in June 2006. \n \n23.  A  key  element  of  the  NTP  is  its  assessment  of  the  priorities  for  rehabilitation, \nmaintenance, and investment in the expansion of the national network across the three modes \nof land, sea, and air transport. This assessment is based on the practicality of providing access \nby the different modes of transport available in rural areas. The NTP decision framework is \nbased on assessments of  \n \n(i)  existing networks; \n(ii)  technical feasibility of providing access by different modes;  \n(iii)  positive and negative economic, social, and environmental impact; and  \n(iv)  the need for connecting infrastructure.  \n \n24  After  potential  subprojects  were  identified,  they  were  prioritized  on  the  basis  of  a \nmulti-criteria analysis of economic benefits, social welfare considerations, environmental impact, \nand intercommunity peace and reconciliation needs. \n \n25.  The NTP contains detailed transport sector and subsector road maps for all modes of \ntransport,  as  well  as  time-based  action  plans  for  transport  infrastructure  preservation  and \ndevelopment. These plans detail actions required, assign responsibilities for implementation, \nand identify the associated costs and proposed sources of funding. The methodology is based \non a least-cost life-cycle analysis of prioritized subprojects, as well as a full analysis of the road \nsubsector\u2019s contribution to development objectives in various locations. Since the plan covers all \nmodes of transport, alternatives to road rehabilitation are considered in this prioritization. \n \n26.  The  NTP  also  covers  organizational  reforms  and  human  resource  development \nprograms to ensure that the required capacity is in place during the planning period. The NTP is \nintended to embody sufficient flexibility to meet emerging needs, constraints, and opportunities. \nIt is designed to satisfy eligibility criteria associated with development partner programs. The \nNTP will be reviewed and updated periodically, and incorporate new government policies. \n \n27.  Sector Finance and the National Transport Fund. The Government has invested \nabout $11.0 million of its own resources and $96 million in external assistance to develop the \nroad  subsector  from  1991\u20132009  (Appendix  5).  Given  the  large  investment  needs  and \nconstrained public finances, the Government will continue to rely on external assistance for road \nrehabilitation and development.  \n \n ", "32  Appendix 3 \n28.  A  significant  portion  of  the  road  network  requires  reconstruction  and  ongoing \nmaintenance.  Road  maintenance  funding  has  averaged  $0.5  million  since  1990,  with  a \ntemporary drop of 80% to an average of $0.1 million during the conflict (1998\u20132002), resulting in \nwidespread deterioration. Funding is significantly below the levels necessary to sustain current \nassets. What proportion goes toward maintenance, versus public sector overhead costs, is \nunclear because of limited accountability. Current maintenance contracts under SIRIP cover \n10% (170 km) of the road network and cost about $1.2 million annually. Maintaining the 20% of \nroads that remain in good or fair condition would cost an estimated $2.4 million annually. The \nbenefits of road rehabilitation will not be realized unless a comprehensive maintenance program \ncontinues to be implemented. \n \n29.  To address the shortfall in maintenance funding, the Government has set up a dedicated \nNational Transport Fund (NTF), supported by TA2 from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \nThe  Government  has  proceeded  to  make  increasing  annual  contributions,  intended  to \neventually match sector maintenance needs. The NTF will also raise revenue from road user \ncharges,  which  are  appropriate  for  transport  infrastructure  preservation.  The  anticipated \nmagnitude of the NTF will be sufficient to maintain all rehabilitated roads. \n \n30.  The NTF task force comprises a range of stakeholders from the Government and the \nprivate sector, and manages the NTF on the basis of sound business principles. Regulations \nare being prepared to operationalize the NTF to be managed by the board of directors. The \nboard will be required to report transparently on its current activities and future plans. The \noperations of the NTF are being designed to ensure more needs-related funding, as well as a \nmore reliable flow and better deployment of funding. \nG.  Main Challenges and Issues \n31.  Given its involvement in road maintenance and rehabilitation, AusAID brought in about \n$2.70  million  of  road  construction  and  maintenance  plant  and  equipment  in  2006  for  the \nmaintenance of Malaita roads. Deployment for this plant was through the Community Sector \nProgram and included the employment of both national and expatriate staff. With the activities of \nthe program being transferred back to MID by 30 June 2010, options for the disposal of the \nplants and equipment are currently being considered.  \n \n32.  The Government faces a number of challenges regarding road transport infrastructure:  \n \n(i)  resolving the scarcity and unreliability of budget allocations to the sector,  \n(ii)  recognizing that maintenance has higher priority than new works, and  \n(iii)  developing asset management capability from planning to implementation. \n \n33.  The major issues include the following: \n \n(i)  rehabilitating roads;  \n(ii)  moving from a reactive to a preventive maintenance approach;  \n(iii)  increasing spending to maintain the current road network;  \n(iv)  ensuring that road design recognizes life-cycle costs; \n(v)  instituting  sustainable  arrangements  for  managing  and  maintaining  roads, \nparticularly with labor-based methods;  \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2007.

ADB and other development partners recognize the above challenges and issues and \nare jointly collaborating to provide resources to gradually address them under unified projects. \nThese have been exemplified by projects cofinanced by AusAID, the European Commission, \nand  the  New  Zealand  Agency  for  International  Development,  such  as  the  Post-Conflict \nEmergency Rehabilitation Project (footnote 1), SIRIP,3 the Emergency Assistance Project,4 the \nDomestic Maritime (Sector) Project,5 and the proposed second-phase project. \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2006.

The Solomon Islands Road Improvement (Sector) Project (SIRIP) was funded by the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB), the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), \nthe New Zealand Agency for International Development, and the Government  of Solomon \nIslands  and  was  aimed  at  (i)  making  social  services  more  accessible  to  poor  and  rural \nhouseholds, (ii) increasing opportunities for employment and income generation among poor \nand rural households, (iii) increasing private sector participation in economic activities, (iv) \nreducing rural poverty by bringing about the development of remote areas, and (v) giving \npreference to areas of previous underinvestment.1  \nB.  Scope \n2.  The scope of SIRIP included rehabilitating up to 100 kilometers (km) of provincial and \nsecondary  rural  gravel  roads  and  40  watercourse  crossings  (bridges,  culverts,  and  wet \ncrossings),  establishing  a  program  for  routine  maintenance,  developing  and  establishing  a \nrobust  asset  management  system,  and  building  the  capacity  of  national  contractors, \nconsultants, and the staff of the Ministry of Infrastructure Development (MID) for planning, \ncontracting,  and  quality  assurance  processes  and  management.  Subproject  selection  was \nbased on the priorities established in the National Transport Plan (NTP). \n3.  The road rehabilitation envisaged a standard that would provide basic all-weather, \nfour-wheel drive access on road sections and passable watercourse crossings except during \nperiods  of  flood,  commensurate  with  the  size  of  population,  and  social  and  economic \ndevelopment  in  the  areas  served.  Rehabilitation  included  limited  upgrading,  such  as \nconstructing short sealed sections through villages or on steep gradients, and reconstruction of \nbridges where conditions and circumstances required it. \nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n4.  The total cost of SIRIP was originally estimated at $16.850 million, comprising a base \ncost  of  $15.765  million  and  $1.085  million  in  contingencies.  The  base  cost  comprised \n(i) $11.000 million for civil works ($10.000 million for road rehabilitation, $0.200 million for the \nlabor-based,  equipment-supported  [LBES]  pilot  program,  and  $0.800 million  for  road \nmaintenance management improvement); (ii) $0.455 million for equipment; and (iii) $4.310 \nmillion for consulting services in project design, supervision, project management, and capacity \ndevelopment. \n5.  The total SIRIP cost has since been increased to $19.40 million to provide for minor \nchanges in scope requested and financed by AusAID: (i) an additional $0.470 million equivalent \nfor the maintenance of roads rehabilitated under a past project in Honiara; (ii) $1.71 million \nequivalent  for  maintenance  activities  for  the  Guadalcanal  subproject  under  community \nparticipation in procurement contracts using LBES technologies; (iii) $0.16 million equivalent for \nthe  capacity  development  of  national  contractors  and  consultants  to  undertake  community \nparticipation in procurement contracts under LBES technology for the Guadalcanal subproject; \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

Manila. \n ", "  Appendix 4  35 \nand  (iv) $0.21  million  equivalent  to  engage  a  contract  management  and/or  procurement \nspecialist for 18 person-months.  \n6.  Grant  financing  of  $18.75  million  was  to  finance  the  civil  works  (96.65%  of  the \nestimated project cost), with the Government of Solomon Islands financing the remaining $0.65 \nmillion (3.35% of project cost) in local costs of project administration. The grant financing \ncomprised $0.35 million from ADB\u2019s Asian Development Fund (1.80% of project cost), $8.65 \nmillion from the Government of Australia (44.59% of project cost), and $9.75 million from the \nGovernment  of  New  Zealand  (50.26%  of  project  cost).  ADB  administered  all  of  the  grant \nfinancing.  \nD.  Status and Progress of Project Implementation \n7.  Since the inception of SIRIP, all three project components (road rehabilitation, road \nmaintenance improvement, and project management and capacity building) have progressed \nand are estimated to be 42% complete. A total of 13 contracts have been awarded\u2014nine for \ncivil works for road maintenance under national competitive bidding and four for consulting \nservices. Contract awards total $5.55 million (30% of the approved amount) and disbursements \ntotal $2.77 million (15% of the approved amount). The major civil works contracts are for the \nroad rehabilitation component. The road rehabilitation subprojects have been identified and \nprioritized under the NTP. The Makira subproject, the rehabilitation of a coastal road on the \nisland of Makira stretching about 7 km east and 61 km to the west of the provincial capital \nKirakira, was made the first priority for rehabilitation under SIRIP. The invitation of bids for this \nsubproject  closed  on  4  August  2009  and  contract  award  is  scheduled  for  the  end  of \nSeptember 2009.  \n8.  The covenants in the grant agreement have mostly been complied with. These required \nthe Government to (i) ensure that MID has enough budget to maintain staffing and support its \nroutine operations, including per diem and local transport for staff participating in field activities; \n(ii) ensure that its budget allocation for road maintenance was increased to at least $1.6 million \nfor fiscal year 2007, and increased by 20% per annum in each subsequent year of the project; \nand (iii) establish, within 1 year of the grant effectiveness date, a special fund (the National \nTransport Fund [NTF] or its equivalent) to make these increased allocations available. \n9.  The Government\u2019s revenue has been severely affected by the global economic and \nfinancial crisis. While the Government has provided for increases in road maintenance in its \nannual budget, in practice it has not disbursed the funds to MID in a timely fashion to meet the \nneeds  of  the  maintenance  program.  MID  has  managed  the  situation  in  the short  term  by \ndeferring contract schedules and contractor payments. The NTF has been legally established \nand  the  Government  has  set  up  a  budget  line  for  NTF  contributions,  but  the  operating \nprocedures have yet to be determined. The NTF is now expected to become operational only in \nlate  2009.  However,  up  to  now,  the  Government  has  satisfactorily  met  its  maintenance \ncommitments. \n10.  Despite  the  limitations  on  the  Government\u2019s  counterpart  funds,  the  maintenance \ncomponents of SIRIP have been performing well. The LBES technique has been well received \nand is usefully generating employment through the establishment of small contracting entities in \nthe provinces of the Solomon Islands. The maintenance contracts are achieving their objectives. \nA change in approach to direct dissemination of the LBES techniques to the contracting industry \nrather than through a piloting process has saved time and enabled the quicker deployment of \nLBES techniques. This has been one reason for the increase in AusAID funding.  \n ", "36  Appendix 4 \n11.  Progress in the rehabilitation component, which is the largest item and comprises the \ninternational competitive bidding component of SIRIP, has been much slower than originally \nprogrammed. The slowdown is due to a lengthy analytical process to progressively refine and \nreach agreement on the multi-criteria analysis for prioritizing rehabilitation sections with the \nproject steering committee and deciding on priority sections. The first candidate subproject rural \nroad  was  in  Choiseul  Province,  but  it  was  subsequently  included  in  the  Solomon  Islands \nEmergency Assistance Project,2 and there was further delay in the preparation of the Makira \nsubproject  that  had  been  eventually  selected  through  detailed  feasibility,  economic, \nenvironmental, and social assessments as part of the multi-criteria analysis. The major delays \nwere attributed to the extended time it took to agree on the subproject\u2019s engineering option, \nwhich included several risks within the envelope of funds available under SIRIP.  \n12.  The following is the detailed status of implementation: \n(i)  Feasibility assessments for the Makira subproject for engineering, economics, \nenvironmental and social and poverty for 72.5 km of road and 25 new wet \ncrossings have been completed. Detailed engineering designs, cost estimates, \nand  bid  documents  are  also  complete.  The  invitation  of  bids  closed  on \n24 July 2009 and the contract is due to be awarded in September 2009. \n(ii)  The maintenance of 14 km of roads in Temotu Province using LBES techniques \nhas been completed.  \n(iii)  Six road maintenance contracts using LBES techniques are nearing completion \nand three contracts under national competitive bidding procedures are also in \nplace.  \n(iv)  Road  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  experiences  from  Solomon  Islands, \nneighboring Pacific island countries, Asia, and Africa were presented at an LBES \nworkshop in October 2007, at which national contractors, community groups, \nnational consultants, staff of relevant government agencies and development \npartners participated. \n(v)  National contractors and various community organizations have been trained in \nLBES techniques and this has avoided the need to pilot-test the LBES program \nof road maintenance activities. \n(vi)  The development and establishment of an asset management system is under \nway with systems for categorizing roads and collecting data on road inventory \nand conditions in advanced stages of development. \n(vii)  A systematic approach to subproject prioritization has been established to draw \nup annual works programs, including the processes of economic, social, and \nenvironmental  screening.  Detailed  engineering  designs,  procurement, \nimplementation, and monitoring procedures are also in place, with MID staff and \nnational consultants undergoing capacity building. \n(viii)  A project management and capacity building unit comprising international and \nnational consultants and MID technical support staff is in place. All the consulting \nservices, except for those needed for the construction supervision of the Makira \nand Guadalcanal road rehabilitation subprojects, are in place and are being \ndelivered. Additional consulting services have been procured for (i) contractor \nand  community  education  and  awareness  programs  in  HIV,  and  (ii) contract \nmanagement and/or procurement. \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2007.

(Grant  0078-SOL, \ncofinanced with European Commission). \n ", "  Appendix 4  37 \n(ix)  Procedures  for  contract  performance  monitoring  have  been  established  and \nimplemented, and a committee comprising technical and engineering staff from \nMID has been formed to evaluate bids. \n(x)  A  stakeholder  working  group  has  been  established  to  support  the  rollout  of \nlabor-based contracts nationwide across all donor programs. \n(xi)  National  consultants  have  been  trained  in  topographic  surveying  for  the \nengineering designs of roads and bridges, including the processing of data and \ninformation using AutoCAD and 12D software. \n(xii)  National contractors have been trained in small business management, including \ncash management and basic accounting. \n(xiii)  A  communications  plan  and  program  has  been  implemented  to  inform \ncommunities  about  crosscutting  issues  in,  and  impact  of,  road  construction \nactivities (e.g., foreign worker road camps, HIV, child protection), and also to \nidentify  and  encourage  local  entrepreneurs  to  be  involved  in  the  business \nopportunities afforded by the use of LBES techniques in maintenance programs. \n(xiv)  A  labor-based  working  group  and  asset  management  committee  has  been \nestablished to coordinate and oversee labor-based maintenance programs, and \nthe development and operation of a robust asset management system.  \n(xv)  A  detailed  review  of  the  training  and  capacity  development  component  was \nconducted during the midterm review, which was completed in July 2009. The \nmidterm review concluded that capacity building has been adequately addressed \nin  project  management,  engineering,  social  and  poverty  assessments,  initial \nenvironmental  examination,  community  consultations,  asset  management, \nprocurement,  contract  administration,  topographic  surveys  and  engineering \ndrawings, monitoring and evaluation, finance and administration, and national \ncontractor training. \n(xvi)  The Government has passed the NTF Act and is preparing the implementing \nregulations. \nE.  Lessons from SIRIP \n13.  SIRIP has introduced LBES techniques for small-scale maintenance contracts as a \nmeans of developing national small and medium-scale contractor capacity. The decision to \nbypass the pilot phase proved successful in speeding up implementation. The proposed project \nwill have an opportunity to build on this success by extending the LBES base maintenance \nprogram. Because of their success, LBES techniques are being implemented in other externally \nassisted programs and MID\u2019s own recurrent maintenance programs. \n14.  The  rehabilitation  component  has  made  slow  progress.  The  need  to  substantially \nmodify the approach from limited rehabilitation of road surfaces to more substantial upgrading \nfocused more on waterway crossings was a result of assumptions about the appropriate level of \nintervention in the initial design of SIRIP, based on limited field data and analysis, which turned \nout to be inappropriate. This reorientation also required individual and joint agreements between \nthe cofinancing partners and the Government, which have taken some time to achieve. A lesson \nfor future projects is the need to acknowledge the risks of designing infrastructure interventions \nwith limited field data, and of relying on untested development assumptions. To obtain congruity \nin development partner financing for such sector projects, multi-criteria evaluation processes \nand  investment  priorities  need  to  be  progressively  agreed  on  among  stakeholders  and \ncontinuously updated, to achieve the goals of aid coordination set out in the Paris Declaration.3 \n                                                 \n3  Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, High Level Forum, Paris, March 2005. \n ", "38  Appendix 4 \nA key lesson under SIRIP is that a more-thorough and more-detailed assessment under a \nproject preparatory technical assistance would have significantly eliminated the engineering and \ncost  estimate  issues  that  were  identified  during  the  feasibility  assessment  of  the  Makira \nsubproject after the project was approved.  \nF.  Rationale for a Second Phase \n15.  The second-phase project is proposed (i) to expand the scope of rehabilitation beyond \nGuadalcanal and Malaita, (ii) to make permanent repairs in water crossings on Guadalcanal \nWest Road damaged by the 50-year flood of February 2009, and (iii) to provide for climate \nchange adaptation. The proposal is consistent with the original objectives of SIRIP and supports \nthe Government\u2019s desire for ADB to take the lead in the road subsector and establish a process \nto ensure that aid to the sector is coordinated and more predictable. \n16.  Without the second phase, the funding shortfall would mean that the Makira subproject \nwould have to be reduced in scope, through a reduction in road length and number of waterway \ncrossings rehabilitated or upgraded or in the design standard of the waterway crossings, and \nthrough  the  exclusion  of  climate  change  adaptation  from  the  design.  In  either  case,  the \nsubproject would not fully achieve its objective of providing reliable and continuous access to \nareas with development potential, to give the population better access to social services, and to \nimprove transport safety. Shortening the length of road to be rehabilitated or upgraded would \nremove the highest-return third section, significantly reducing the economic internal rate of \nreturn. A compromise in design standards would risk damage to the investment from severe \nflood events, and any new livelihood developed as a result of the road improvement would be \nunsustainable. \n17.  A  second  phase  will  also  allow  the  continuing  maintenance  of  the  recent  road \ninvestments made under ADB and AusAID financing, before the takeover of this responsibility \nby the NTF. Without a second phase, a deferred maintenance backlog would build up, the \ncondition of the roads would worsen, and it would be more costly to return the roads to their \ncurrent condition. \n ", "  Appendix 5  39 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ROAD SUBSECTOR, 1990\u20132009 \n \nFunding  Loan/Grant  Amount  \nAgency  or TA No.  Project Description  ($ million) \nADB  0704  Guadalcanal Road Improvement Projecta  6.50 \n  1823  Post-Conflict Emergency Rehabilitation Projectb  18.50 \n  4494  Institutional Strengthening of Ministry of Infrastructure   \nand Development  0.70 \n  4944  Strengthening Disaster Recovery Planning and   \nCoordination  0.80 \n  0048  Road Improvement (Sector) Projectc  18.75 \n  0078  Emergency Assistance Projectd  4.30 \nAusAID  Grant  Mataniko and Poha Bridges  2.00 \n  Grant  Community Sector Project  9.00 \nEED  Grant  Sasamunga\u2013Papara Road Rehabilitation Project  0.25 \nEuropean  Grant  Transport Sector Strategy  0.45 \nCommission  Grant  Choiseul Road Improvement Project  0.30 \n  Grant  Structural Adjustment Program for MID  0.80 \n  Grant  Makira Road Improvement Project  0.15 \n  Grant  Malaita Road Maintenance Project  0.10 \n  Grant  Malaita Rural Infrastructure Project  7.00 \n  Grant  Solomon Islands Rural Transport Project  4.00 \n  Grant  Cyclone Nina Emergency Rehabilitation Project  1.00 \nJapan  Grant  Lunnga Bridge   5.82 \n  Grant  Metapono and Alligator Bridges   6.72 \n  Grant  White River, Bonege, and Tanaeba Bridges  7.45 \n  Grant  Community Rural Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project  0.50 \n  Grant  Labor-Based Road Maintenance Projecte  0.46 \nGrant  Nqalimbiu, Tenaru 1 and Tenaru 2 Bridges  8.60 \n  Loan  Honiara Main Road Upgrading Project I  7.50 \nKFAED  Loan  Honiara Main Road Upgrading Project IIf  9.23 \nTaipei,China  Grant  Weathercoast Road Improvement Project  0.20 \n  Grant  Noro\u2013Munda Road Rehabilitation Project  0.10 \n  Grant  Gizo Road Upgrading Project  0.30 \nTotal     95.78 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, AusAID = Australian Agency for International Development, EED = Evangelischer \nEntwicklungsdienst, KFAED = Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, TA = technical assistance. \na  Amount includes cofinancing loans from International Development Association of World Bank ($2.0 million), \nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries Fund for International Development ($1.5 million), and Government \nof Solomon Islands ($1.0 million). \nb   Amount  includes  cofinancing  grants  from  the  governments  of  Australia  ($2.0  million)  and  New  Zealand \n($6.5 million). \nc   Amount includes cofinancing grants from governments of Australia ($8.65 million) and New Zealand ($9.75 million). \nd   Amount includes a cofinancing of grants from the European Commission ($4.0 million). \ne  Financed by Japan and executed by the United Nations Development Programme via subcontract with the \nInternational Labor Organization. \nf  Amount includes cofinancing loans from Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries Fund for International \nDevelopment ($1.73 million), and Government of Solomon Islands ($1.20 million). \nSource: Ministry of Infrastructure Development, Government of Solomon Islands. \n \n ", "40  Appendix 6 \nSUBPROJECT ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA \nA.  Project Roads \n1.  The Second Road Improvement (Sector) Project will rehabilitate about 20 kilometers of \nmain and secondary roads and about 30 water crossings (including bridges, culverts, and wet \ncrossings), representing a 3-year time slice of the rehabilitation projects in the Government\u2019s \nNational Transport Plan (NTP). The selection of subprojects will be based on agreed eligibility \ncriteria (paras. 3\u20136).  \n2.  The  roads  to  be  rehabilitated  are  mostly  gravel  and  earthen  roads,  with  a  small \nproportion of sealed roads, which have deteriorated to such an extent that patching, would be \nineffective and uneconomical in restoring the surfaces and contours to an acceptable quality \nand maintainable condition. Such pavements require surface reconstruction and strengthening \nto handle future traffic. Some new surface sealing might be required in areas of high erosion \npotential,  such  as  steep  slopes  and  alongside  flood  plains.  The  water  crossings  will  be \nreconstructed or rehabilitated with bridges, culverts, and wet crossings to climate-adaptable \nstandards to provide all-weather access and connectivity. The rehabilitation of the subprojects \nwill be subject to site investigation and design criteria, though a range of engineering solutions \nwill be considered. The rehabilitation works might also include minor upgrading and safety \nimprovements. \nB.  Subproject Eligibility Criteria  \n3.  Subprojects will meet the following general eligibility criteria: \n \n(i)  The subprojects will upgrade or rehabilitate roads and water crossings assessed \nas  high-development  priorities  on  the  basis  of  their  contribution  to  the \nachievement of the objectives of the Government\u2019s Medium-Term Development \nStrategy 2008\u20132010 and prioritized in the NTP, particularly \n(a)  improved  accessibility  to  social  services  among  poor  and  rural \nhouseholds,  including  schools,  health  facilities,  and  government \nextension services; \n(b)  increased opportunities for employment and income generation among \npoor and rural households; \n(c)  potential  for  increased  private  sector  participation  in  provincial  and \nnational economic activities; \n(d)  potential to catalyze development in remote areas with poor access; and  \n(e)  contribution to poverty reduction among poor and rural households. \n(ii)  The subprojects will be selected from the NTP. The NTP has been endorsed by \nthe Government. \n4.  Each subproject will be economically viable, and shall have demonstrated an economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  acceptable  to  ADB.1  An  economic  analysis  will  be  conducted  in \naccordance with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Guidelines for the Economic Analysis \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2007. Achieving Development Effectiveness in Weakly Performing Countries (The ADB\u2019s Approach to \nEngaging with Weakly Performing Countries). Manila. Para 49(i) stipulates: Programs and projects in weakly \nperforming countries should not be expected to always yield the same financial and economic rates of return as \nwould be expected in stronger-performing developing member countries. If ADB wishes to continue to provide \ndevelopment assistance to weakly performing countries, it must recognize that the financial and economic risks of \ninvestments are higher and that lower returns are likely. \n ", "  Appendix 6  41 \nof Projects.2 In addition to the standard parameters of road subsector analysis,3 the subproject \nwill be assessed on quantitative grounds for its contribution to \n \n(i)  potential for increased agriculture due to lower freight costs and more reliable \naccess;  \n(ii)  employment  of  local  communities  and  contractors  for  maintenance  and \nsmall-scale works; and \n(iii)  increased incomes, particularly among poor and rural households. \n5.  Environmental screening will be conducted for all subprojects. No subproject classified \nas category A in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003) will be \neligible for funding under the project. In the selection of subproject sites, including extraction \nsites for materials to be imported into the road construction sites, the following environmental \ncriteria will be used for the first level of screening. If any of these criteria are found applicable to \nthe site, then the subproject will not be accepted as part of the project: \n(i)    roads in or adjacent to areas classified as ecologically sensitive, and therefore in \ncategory A, requiring the production of an environmental impact assessment; \n(ii)  requirement for major realignment of the existing road; \n(iii)    significant loss of natural or primary forest; \n(iv)  significant loss or damage to near-shore marine environments, such as reefs, \nmangroves, or other sensitive coastal areas; \n(v)  permanent negative effect on a known rare or endangered species; and \n(vi)  permanent damage to irreplaceable cultural relics and archaeological sites. \n \n6.  Screening  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impact  will  be  conducted  for  all \nsubprojects.  No  subproject  that  would  entail  involuntary  resettlement,  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995), will be eligible for funding under the project.4 \nC.  Subproject Assessment Process \n7.  Potential subprojects are identified and prioritized in the NTP on the basis of high-level \nassessments  of  (i)  existing  networks;  (ii)  the  technical  feasibility  of  providing  access  by \nalternative modes; (iii) positive and negative economic, social, and environmental impact; and \n(v) the need for connecting infrastructure (Appendix 3).  \n \n8.  The  executing  agency,  the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  Development,  assisted  by  the \nproject management unit, will conduct and document an assessment of each subproject using \nthe criteria described in paras. 3\u20136. Each assessment will involve collecting and analyzing \n                                                 \n2   ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.

Introduction \n1.  The consultants engaged under the existing project management and capacity building \nunit  provide  day-to-day  project  management  of  the  Solomon  Islands  Road  Improvement \n(Sector) Project (SIRIP).1 Additional consulting services will be financed under the proposed \ngrant to support further project management, engineering design, project administration, and \nimplementation  supervision  for  the  Second  Road  Improvement  (Sector)  Project.  The \nconsultancy services will focus on three subprojects for road rehabilitation: (i) rehabilitation of a \ncoastal road on the island of Makira, about 72.5 kilometers (km) of the provincial capital, \nKirakira, with 25 wet crossings; (ii) rehabilitation of flood damage on the island of Guadalcanal \nfrom  Poha  River  to  Naro  Hill,  about  29  km  of  road  and  11  bridges;  and  (iii)  the  Malaita \nsubproject consisting of the realignment of about 8 km of road and construction. In addition to \nthe rehabilitation, the project will support consulting services for the maintenance of roads and \nbridges in the subproject areas. The road maintenance will include community contracting using \nlabor-based, equipment-supported (LBES) techniques. The project will also support institutional \nstrengthening and capacity development of Ministry of Infrastructure Development (MID) staff, \nnational consultants, and contractors. \n \n2.  In  Solomon  Islands,  climate  change  impact  can  be  observed  in  sea-level  and \nprecipitation patterns and temperature. The likelihood of climate change impact in the future and \ncurrent climate change patterns need to be considered in assessing the most appropriate \nadaptation  options  and  incorporating  them  into  the  detailed  engineering  design  and \nenvironmental management plan to improve the resiliency of road infrastructure built under the \nproject. This special feature will be incorporated into the designs through additional consulting \nservices. \n \n3.  A total of 53 person-months of international consulting services and 158 person-months \nof local consultancy services will be required under the project. All consultants will be hired in \naccordance with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Given the challenges of attracting firms to weakly \nperforming countries and remote locations, the consultants will be hired through quality- and \ncost-based selection based on a simplified technical proposal. The services will cover (i) project \nmanagement;  (ii) institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  building;  (iii)  detailed  engineering \ndesign; (iv) project administration including accounting, payments to contractors, auditing of \naccounts, filing, and assistance with general office administration duties; (v) implementation \nsupervision and community consultation; and (vi) climate change adaptation.  \nB.  Project Management \n4.  The  new  project  management  unit  (PMU)  will  require  about  12  person-months  of \ninternational consulting services and 15 person-months of national consulting services. The \nPMU will support MID in managing the project. \n \n5.  Project Manager (international, 12 person-months).

A project performance and monitoring system will be established within 6 months of \ngrant  effectiveness.  Performance  indicators  to  be  monitored  before,  during,  and  after \nconstruction  should  include  those  for  (i)  economic  development,  (ii)  transport  sector \nperformance, (iii) socioeconomic development, (iv) environmental impact, (v) maintenance, and \n(vi)  institutional  development.  With  these  guidelines  the  executing  agency  (the  Ministry  of \nInfrastructure  Development  [MID])  and  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  will  develop \nquantitative indicators for monitoring and evaluating the performance of the project in relation to \nits goals and purposes before start of the project, and will refine these indicators during project \nimplementation. \n \n2.  Baseline data for these indicators, which will be collected during the subproject feasibility \nanalysis, will be monitored after subproject completion. Some baseline data might be available \nfrom two national surveys\u2014of household income and expenditure, and of demographics and \nhealth\u2014conducted  in  2006\u20132007.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  based  on \ngender-disaggregated  data  where  feasible.  The  PMU  will  provide  hands-on  training  to  the \ndomestic consultants and TPPU staff on data collection, monitoring, and evaluation. This will \nallow monitoring to be maintained in the future. MID with the assistance of PMU shall monitor \nand evaluate the indicators according to the agreed framework on a quarterly basis to determine \nthe efficiency and effectiveness of the Project and submit them to ADB through the quarterly \nprogress reports.  \nA.  Economic Development \n3.  Improved accessibility is expected to increase output volume and prices of agricultural \ncommodities in the subproject areas. Baseline data on the production and prices of copra, \ncocoa, and market produce should be collected and updated. \n \n4.  Baseline data on formal and informal employment, disaggregated by sector or activity, \nshould be collected and updated. During and after rehabilitation, data should be kept on the \namount of employment created in rehabilitation and regular maintenance. \n \n5.  Indicators for annual household income and sources of income should be developed, \nand baseline data collected and updated annually. The percentage of poverty or hardship of the \npopulation or households in the project area should also be estimated. \nB.  Transport Sector Performance \n6.  Subproject feasibility studies will document the conditions of roads, and measure and \nforecast  a  range  of  technical  performance  indicators  (Table  A11.1).  Appropriate  indicators \nshould be developed for rural conditions, which can be used during feasibility surveys, updated \nafter rehabilitation, and monitored before and after annual maintenance. In addition, because \ntransport demand is linked to gross domestic product, the real annual growth rates for the \ncountry (and for the provinces, where available) should be reported with the results.  \n \n ", "58  Appendix 11 \n \nTable A11.1: Transport Sector Performance Indicators \nItem  Indicators  Remarks \nCondition  Roughness  Poor/fair/good \nAccessibility  All weather/seasonal \nPerformance  Traffic volumes  AADT \nTraffic growth  % per year \nTravel times to key destinations  Average  \nVehicle ownership  By vehicle type \nFrequency of public transport services  Number per day \nCost of passenger transport services  SI$ per kilometer \nCost of freight transport services  SI$ per kilometer \nAccident rates  Number per year \nAADT = average annual daily traffic. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \nC.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGs \nA. Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nThe Solomon Islands is one of the most disadvantaged Pacific developing member countries. Hardship has been exacerbated \nby tension and conflict, the ensuing law and order problems, financial crisis, a contracting economy, rising unemployment, \nand the high population growth rates. Many Solomon Islanders have been displaced by the conflict. \nUnder the poverty partnership agreement, signed between ADB and Solomon Islands in 2003, programs, projects and \nactivities funded by ADB will draw on the National Economic Recovery, Reform and Development Plan for 2003\u20132006 to \nstrengthen the focus on reducing hardship.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                 Targeting Classification: General Intervention (GI) \n1. Key Issues  \nProject. According to analysis of the Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2005/06 (HIES) data undertaken by the \nUnited Nations Development Programme, poverty in the Solomon Islands context does not mean hunger or destitution, but \nrather the struggle to meet daily or weekly living expenses, particularly those that require cash payments. The definition \nfurther included (i) households constantly having to make choices between competing demands for household expenditure \nand the limited availability of cash income to meet that expenditure; (ii) households having to make trade-offs between one bill \nand another, food or school fees, utilities or bus fares; (iii) households borrowing regularly from loan sharks, who charge very \nhigh interest rates, for small unsecured loans to meet family commitments and community obligations; and (iv) households \nthat are frequently or constantly in debt. Households deemed to be experiencing basic needs poverty therefore face hardship \ndaily. They struggle to pay bills and purchase adequate and suitably nutritious food. According to the estimation of poverty \nlines, the HIES showed that the average national incidence of basic needs poverty was 18.8% of households and 22.7% of \nthe population, and for rural areas the rate of basic needs poverty was equivalent to 15.2% of households and 18.8% of the \npopulation. Rapid rural appraisal (RRA) results showed that poor households are those with insufficient cash income to buy \ngoods in everyday use, considered as necessities that cannot be produced by the household (kerosene, clothes, soap, \nmedicine, matches, cooking pots, tea, and sugar), while \u201chardship\u201d families are those households that cannot afford to \n(i) consume occasional \u201cluxuries\u201d (mainly imported processed foods consumed by choice) such as rice, tinned fish, tinned \nmeat, cabin biscuits, tinned or powdered milk, noodles, flour; (ii) contribute to school fees or make cash donations to church \nand ceremonial activities; (iii) improve the quality of their houses (with corrugated-iron roofs and rainwater catchments for \nexample); and (iv) pay fares for occasional transport to the commercial and service center.  \nMakira subproject. Makira is the most disadvantaged province. The province had 9.9% of all rural households and 10.8% of \nthe total rural population, but accounted for 15.3% of rural poor households and 16.4% of the total rural poor population. The \nsubproject area adjacent has high economic potential for smallholder cocoa production and timber milling, and many \nhouseholds earn cash from agricultural products sold at the provincial town market and to commercial buyers for export. The \nmajor sources of income in Makira households (56%) include the sale of garden products, commercial crops such as copra \nand cocoa, logging and sawmill activities, and small, home-based businesses like bakeries, shops, or kerosene depots. \nHowever, it is likely that most households experience hardship. The HIES shows average and median annual household \nexpenditure is much lower for Makira-Ulawa than for the country as a whole, as it is for average and median per capita \nexpenditure being close to the dollar-per-day poverty line measure. Housing has also been used as a relative poverty \nindicator because those who are more economically disadvantaged than others cannot normally afford to improve their \nstandard of housing (improved houses are widely aspired to throughout Solomon Islands). A much-higher proportion of \nhouses in Makira are built of traditional materials, while few houses have rainwater tanks, indicating that very few houses \nhave corrugated-iron roofs. In the RRA sample villages, except for the prosperous village of Kaonasugu, less than 30% of \nhouses had iron roofs and fewer had rainwater tanks. From the data provided during the road user survey, overall some 5% of \nhouseholds fall below the food poverty level (FPL) and 11% fall below the basic needs poverty level (BNPL) based on \npotential weekly income, while 11% fall below the FPL and 21% fall below the BNPL based on average actual weekly income. \nGuadalcanal subproject. Nearly 50% of road users are from households that fall below the BNPL and 41% of road users are \nfrom households that fall below the FPL based on actual income. Repairing and reinstating the road will ensure access to \nHoniara and key facilities and services along the main road (schools and health posts). Following rehabilitation of the road, \naccess for people living along the Weather Coast, as well as the performance of a key route in the island transport network\u2014\n ", "Appendix 12  61 \nWest Road\u2014will improve. This will facilitate the flow of traffic, goods, and passengers both internally (along the Weather \nCoast and through the subproject area to the market in Honiara). Communities and service providers require access. During \nthe RRA for this subproject, and the Lambi\u2013Naro Hill subproject feasibility study in 2008, improving access as a means to \nincreasing household incomes was a direct correlation made by villagers during the community meetings. \n \n2. Design Features  \n \nMakira subproject. The subproject will construct safer and more reliable river and stream crossings along the road east of \nKirkira to the Warhito River and west of Kirkira to the Wianuri River. Providing or restoring river crossings will create \nincentives for cheaper transportation services access to markets and to cocoa, copra, and timber buyers. This will increase \nhousehold incomes and was stated as a priority for development in the communities consulted. Better and more-durable \ncrossing will provide villagers with easier and safer access to social services on the road and in Kirakira. \nGuadalcanal subproject. Rehabilitation and upgrading of waterway crossing on the main road on Guadalcanal has been \nincluded in the project following record rains and flooding in late January 2009, rated as a 50-year event. Some 13 people \nwere killed during the flooding, which is estimated to have directly affected some 9,000 people and indirectly affected a further \n30,000, and destroyed about 96% of food gardens and 5% of homes on Guadalcanal Island, Malaita, Makira, and Central \nprovinces. Extensive damage to roads, bridges, causeways, and fords resulted in severance at a number of locations, cutting \noff road access to the western part of the island (the Weather Coast). Immediate repair and temporary works were undertaken \nto facilitate movement of traffic, and assist with flood relief and assistance activities; however, permanent works are required \nalong the road and at damaged bridges and culverts to provide for safe and reliable connectivity to Honiara for communities \nliving along the road and on the Weather Coast. \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nFindings of Social Analysis  \n \nMakira subproject. About 45% of the population in the vicinity of the subproject road west of Kirarkira town is cut off from the \nprovincial center during frequent flooding by the Waita\u2019a river. Water damage to vehicles deters the private sector from \nproviding regular passenger and goods transportation services on the road and passengers and cargo carriers rely on \nirregular and expensive sea transport, hiring or paying fares to travel on small outboard motor-powered craft. Their limited \naccess to Kirakira town, where secondary schools, hospital, shops, market, wharf, airfield, and commodity buyers are located, \nplaces them at a disadvantage. People reported that life is hard because they cannot make enough money to meet school \nfees, or improve the quality of their houses (with corrugated-iron roofs and rainwater catchments, for example). Among other \nhardships people reportedly face is expensive sea transport to services available only in town. This is true especially for \npeople on the west side of Wairaha River. Hardship is also described as extreme difficulty in quickly transporting medical \nemergency cases to hospital. Hence, the great concern of the people is the provision of safe road transport so that everyone \ncan have access to such services.   \n \nGuadalcanal subproject. In terms of access, Guadalcanal can be divided into four regions: east, west, north, and south. In \nterms of nearness to the main urban center of Honiara, the north, northeast, northwest, and to some extent the eastern and \nwestern areas have comparatively better access to the city than the south, southeast, and southwest regions. Although the \nsouthern region is only a short, direct, distance from the northern part of the island, the impassable terrain combined with \ninadequate shipping services and the lack of roads are key constraints on the commercial development of the area. \nProducers from this area cannot sell surplus goods at the central market in Honiara. The physical differences between the \nWeather Coast and the rest of the island translate into large differences in villagers\u2019 welfare, physical infrastructure (including \nroads), health and education services, and potential for improvement. The ethnic tensions that affected Solomon Islands \nbetween 1999 and 2003 have had a profound impact on many people in Guadalcanal. Many people on the Weather Coast \nfled the fighting and moved inland or closer to Honiara. About 12,800 people in Guadalcanal were displaced during the \ntensions. Security was restored by the RAMSI force from July 2003 onward, but the economic, social, and demographic \nimpact continues in all parts of the province. As a result, Guadalcanal Province is considered to be about 10 years behind in \nterms of socioeconomic development. \nGuadalcanal people live on customary clan (sometimes referred to as \u201cline\u201d) land. Traditionally, Guadalcanal societies are \nmatrilineal: land and property are inherited from the mother and the mother\u2019s family. It is traditional practice for a male \nmarrying into a line or clan to have rights to use the maternal clan land. While a male member of a clan marrying a woman \nfrom another clan has the right to bring his wife to live on his clan\u2019s land, the wife and children will not have landowning rights \non the clan land.  \nEighteen different, but related, languages are spoken on Guadalcanal. The languages are structurally dialects of the one \nprototype Guadalcanal language, and it is relatively easy for people from one language group to understand and talk to \npeople from other groups using their own dialect. People speaking different languages or dialects technically belong to \ndifferent clans or lines. \n ", "62  Appendix 12 \n \nThe economy of the subproject area is largely dependent on cocoa and copra production. Most households have small \ngardens or shared garden plots. The main crops grown include cassava, kumara, taro, pana, and cocoa. Teak, sago palms, \nbetel nut, cut-nut, pawpaw, and bananas are also grown in the area. Most working-age adults are engaged in agriculture and \nlivestock, with a slightly higher proportion of females (60%) compared with males (52%) in this livelihood activity. Fishing \n(2%), forestry (0.4%), and mining or quarrying and construction (10%) are the only livelihood activities of males. Some 25% of \nfemales, compared with 19% of males, are in public administration or the health and education sector.  \nA small proportion of households (3%) in the subproject run small canteens, and 29% (between 4% and 100% of all \nhouseholds in two villages) are involved in producing cooked or baked food for sale. Overall, some 9% are involved in fishing, \nwith two villages\u2014Naro (44%) and Maravovo (34%)\u2014accounting for much-greater proportions of households than the other \nvillages. All households in Vura, Maravovo, Gurumai, and Tuvu produce cocoa, copra, garden crops, and betel nut.  \nThe primary beneficiaries of the project are the people who live in the wider catchment area of the subproject road. According \nto the 1999 census population, adjusted for growth, the population directly along the subproject road is 7,782 (using \nenumeration areas for Sahulu and Tandai wards from the census). An additional 21,160 people who live between Lambi and \nWanderer Bay and along the Weather Coast (southern coast) also rely on access by means of the subproject road. The \npopulation considered to be served by this section of the main road is 28,942.  \nMore specifically, the population served includes the following groups of road users: (i) existing road users, be they vehicle \ndrivers, passengers, or users of nonmotorized transport; (ii) households living in villages along, and in the catchment area of, \nthe main road who grow or sell a range of cash crops including copra and cocoa; (iii) passenger and goods (cargo) transport \nservice providers and commercial truck drivers; (iv) schoolchildren and teachers at the schools and major facility at Selwyn \nCollege; and (v) small businesses and traders including vendors at local or informal markets, trade store owners, and produce \nbuyers. Provincial authorities and key social service providers such as those in the education and health sector will also \nbenefit from the reinstatement of the road.   \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nProject: A participation strategy was developed for SIRIP and all subprojects following initial RRA, IPSA and/or IEE \nconsultations with stakeholders. The strategy includes participatory community-based activities before construction to raise \nawareness  of  the  risks,  and  participation  in  labor-based,  equipment-supported  (LBES)  construction  and  maintenance \nactivities. The program will be organized and coordinated by the SIRIP community development specialist.  \nMakira  subproject.  Consultation  meetings  were  held  in  August  2007  at  14  places  along  the  subproject  road,  with \n424 participants from 41 villages. The meetings were open in that anybody with an interest in the subproject was invited to \nparticipate; for smaller villages, a group of villages was invited to attend a meeting.  \nGuadalcanal  subproject.  Consultation  included  key  informant  interviews  with  village  and  church  leaders,  RRA  with \n103 participants, a road user survey, and discussions with village leaders. A survey of road users at several locations along \nthe subproject road was completed in March and April 2009.  \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n Information sharing     Consultation     Collaborative decision making    Empowerment \n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes    No  \nA communications plan for the Project has been prepared. \nRisks will be addressed through (i) measures to prevent conflicts between local people and contractors; (ii) road safety \neducation by the provincial police and local nongovernment organizations (NGOs); and (iii) HIV awareness campaigns in \nvillages  with  the  involvement  of  a  specialized  NGO  and  the  provincial  Department  of  Health.  There  will  also  be \nawareness raising to maximize benefits from the subproject. All awareness activities will involve local and international NGOs \nworking in the province, and provincial government agencies.  \nA stakeholder analysis is included in this report. The primary stakeholders are members of communities in the subproject area \nwho, assuming the private sector provides transport services on the rehabilitated road, will benefit from (i) improved access to \nmarkets; (ii) improved access to health services; (iii) increased incentives to produce copra as transport to markets improve; \n(iv) increased incomes from produce and cash crop marketing, allowing families to invest in better housing and rainwater \ncatchments; (v) improved public health status; and (vi) more-profitable small household retail businesses as local incomes \nrise.  \nOther stakeholders who will benefit are transport, provincial health and education and agricultural extension service providers, \nand merchants supplying goods to and buying cocoa, copra, and sawn timber from the subproject area. \n \n ", "Appendix 12  63 \nC. Gender and Development \nKey Issues.  \nGeneral. There is a fairly clear division of labor between men and women, with women working longer hours than men at \nroutine tasks to maintain their households. Women are primarily responsible for food crops and men for cash crops (however, \nwomen contribute labor to activities such as copra drying and cocoa harvesting). Women interviewed said that the restoration \nof transport services on the road would reduce their burden of carrying garden produce and increase their incomes by giving \nthem access to the town market. \nThe major differences between women\u2019s and men\u2019s travel patterns are grounded in the gender-based division of labor and the \nlocation in which this work is undertaken. The focus of women\u2019s daily activities and, therefore, movements is typically the \nhomestead. Women tend to take shorter, more frequent, and more dispersed trips during the day to fetch water, collect \nfirewood, raise livestock, and undertake cocoa and/or copra production.  \nGender also plays a role in determining the incidence of poverty in Solomon Islands. The HIES analysis suggests that \nhouseholds headed by women are slightly overrepresented in the lowest three expenditure deciles. In rural areas, households \nheaded by women are particularly overrepresented in the lowest quintile (20%) of households, suggesting that these \nhouseholds are among the poorest in these areas. After controlling for household size and gender of household head \n(populations of households headed by men and women), a different picture emerges, with households headed by women \nearning significantly more actual income (SI$653.13 per week) and potential income (SI$1,898.92 per week) than households \nheaded by men (SI$136.97 per week [actual] and SI$429.28 per week [potential]). The survey data show that a higher \nproportion of women road users are from households falling below the poverty lines for both potential and average actual \nweekly incomes.  \nThe main gender impact of the subprojects is as follows: (i) the gender-biased nature of transport in the project area and the \ndifferential  impact  of  failing  infrastructure  between  the  genders;  (ii)  women\u2019s  participation  in  LBES  construction  and \nmaintenance; (iii) the gender impact of LBES road construction methods; and (iv) the role of women contractors and the \nbarriers they face in responding to the implementation of a gender-equitable LBES road maintenance program. \nParticipation in LBES activities provides an income-generating opportunity presented by employment in road maintenance. \nParticipation in roadworks gives both women and men a chance to have cash. Access to cash would give women an \nopportunity to acquire productive assets and could contribute to their economic empowerment. With improved household \nincome, there is likely to be improved household welfare, and the possibility that households may move above the poverty \nline. Overall, the community will benefit from the increased purchasing power of the workers. With better access as a result of \nimproved infrastructure, farm-gate prices may improve and commodity prices reduce.  \nAny participation will need to be balanced with the usual (paid and nonpaid) workload of women and men. Women are more \nlikely to be disproportionately affected since, in addition to providing LBES, they will continue doing household chores and \nother unpaid work. This means that they will experience even more fragmented use of their time and have less time for leisure \nand rest. \nA number of positive actions are recommended for implementation in project design: (i) identify and remove any potential \ngender bias within the local procurement processes; (ii) prequalify contractors including women or award extra points \nproportionate to the participation of women; (iii) provide training and information on contracting systems, procedures, and \nprocesses (the training should address gender issues including greater focus on gender-balanced community participation, \nenabling an understanding of the gender impact of failing infrastructure, and of the noneconomic benefits of investment); (iv) \nprovide for more flexibility in the criteria for the selection of enterprises to be trained as small and medium-sized rehabilitation \ncontractors, thus removing the present bias toward firms led by technically qualified male degree holders and enabling the \ndevelopment  of  women-owned  construction  enterprises;  (v)  identify  means  (such  as  microfinance  or  revolving  credit \nschemes) to overcome other possible barriers such as difficulty in securing the start-up capital that a small-scale contractor \nneeds to purchase equipment and tools and to provide flexibility with cash flow (especially before the payment of the first \ninvoice); (vi) require contractors to ensure that women make up at least a third of their labor force (attaining this proportion will \nmean that the contractor must proactively invite women to sign up for construction activities rather than recruit only those who \nshow interest, and also select women to be forepersons); (vii) require contractors to use task-based instead of daily rates, to \nadopt flexible working times, and to provide women with separate and special facilities to promote their participation; (viii) \nrequire contractors not to allocate women traditional tasks or to allocate tasks along existing gender divisions of labor; (ix) \nrequire contractors to use alternative recruitment criteria (other than physical fitness), and not to schedule interviews on fixed \ndates, which can deter women\u2019s participation; (x) require contractors to recruit a new workforce at regular intervals (such as \nevery 5 km) to spread work opportunities and ensure that women are not discouraged by excessive distances to the \nworkplace; (xi) require equal pay for equal work for both men and women; and (xii) require contractors to submit weekly \nrecords of daily labor, disaggregated by gender. \nMakira subproject. The road user survey showed that some 69% of travel undertaken by women is associated with \nlivelihood activities and 31% related to social or customary activities, while of all men\u2019s trips, nearly three-quarters (73%) are \nassociated with livelihood and productive activities and 27% of trips are social or customary. Of all the trips associated with \nlivelihood and productive activities, 58% are made by men and 47% are made by women, while of all trips related to social or \n ", "64  Appendix 12 \n \ncustomary activities, some 51% are made by women and 53% are made by men. Collection of copra, cocoa, or other crop, \nbetel nut, or fish accounts for the largest proportion of all men\u2019s trips (26%) and women\u2019s trips (24%), followed by trips to the \nmarket or for shopping (20% of women\u2019s trips and 18% of men\u2019s trips). Trips for water collection account for 3% of women\u2019s \ntrips and 2% of men\u2019s trips. Over three-quarters (84%) of all trips made in the subproject area are done on foot; trips by truck \naccount for 9% of travel (10% of trips made by women and 8% of trips made by men) while canoe or boat travel account for \n7% of trips (6% of women\u2019s trips and 7% of men\u2019s trips). Only male road users stated they also use bicycles (2%). For trips \nthat are made on foot, many involve carrying loads (equipment, goods for sale, or goods purchased) on the head or the back, \npossibly increasing travel time. This travel burden coupled with the work burden means that women\u2019s labor is not easily \ntransferable.  \nGuadalcanal Subproject: The results of the road survey show that, overall, 71% of trips are associated with livelihood and \nproductive activities and 21% are related to social and customary activities. The remaining 8% of trips are classified as \u201cother\u201d \nand cannot be easily identified as falling into one or other of the foregoing categories. Some 69% of travel undertaken by \nwomen is associated with livelihood activities and 23% is related to social or customary activities. Of all men\u2019s trips, nearly \nthree-quarters (72%) are associated with livelihood and productive activities and 20% are social or customary. A high \nproportion of trips associated with the outputs of livelihood and productive activities are made by truck (89% of trips of people \ngoing to the market or selling goods, and 84% of trips made by people collecting copra, fish, and other crops), and 7% of trips \nfor other work are also made by truck. For trips for social reasons, 77% are made to visit family or friends, and 16% of trips to \nhealth facilities are made by truck. Trips for gardening or tending the plantation are nearly all made on foot (97%), and 27% of \nother work-related trips are also made on foot. \nTravel times do not vary much according to the gender of the road user. Trips of less than half an hour account for 42% of all \ntrips made by women and 35% of all trips made by men. The travel times that account for the next-largest proportion of trips \nby gender are trips of between 1 and 2 hours for women (26%) and trips of between 2 and 4 hours for men (26%). Twice as \nmany men make trips of between half an hour and an hour. In terms of distances traveled, most trips made\u201469% of trips \noverall (62% of women\u2019s trips and 73% of men\u2019s trips) \u2014are less than 0.5 km. Trips of 1\u20132 km account for 21% of all trips, \n27% of trips by women, and 17% of trips made by men. Women (10%) more than men (6%) make trips of 3\u20135 km. Longer \ntrips of at least 6 km account for 3% of trips, and are undertaken by men more frequently than women.  \nTrips associated with gardening or plantation work account for 14% of men\u2019s trips and 9% of women\u2019s trips. Collection of fruits \nand/or vegetables and shells also account for the largest proportion of women\u2019s trips (42%) followed by trips to the market or \nfor shopping (16%) and trips to health facilities (14%), while travel associated with other work accounts for a small proportion \n(1%) of all trips made by women. \nTrips on foot account for 36% of all trips (37% of trips made by women and 29% of trips made by men), while bus travel \naccounts for 6% of trips overall (11% of women\u2019s trips and 9% of men\u2019s trips) and canoe or boat travel account for 2% of trips \n(1% of women\u2019s trips and 5% of men\u2019s trips). For trips that are made on foot, many involve carrying loads (either equipment, \ngoods for sale, or goods purchased) on the head or the back, possibly increasing travel time. This travel burden coupled with \nthe work burden means that women\u2019s labor is not easily transferable.   \nThe selling of copra, cocoa, or other crops, betel nut, or fish accounts for the largest proportion of all men\u2019s trips (19%) \nfollowed by collection of same (16%). Over half (56%) of all trips made in the subproject area are done on foot, accounting for \n59% of trips made by women and 54% of trips made by men. A smaller proportion of women travel by either truck (31%) \ncompared with men (36%), or by canoe (8%) compared with men (11%).  \nIn Guadalcanal, educational achievement varies according to gender. Twice as many women (9%) compared with men (4%) \nhave no education, slightly more men (26%) than women (24%) have a primary education, and twice as many men (4%) as \nwomen (2%) have graduated in secondary education from Year 11 to Year 13.  \n \n2.  Key Actions.  \n \n   Gender plan     Other actions/measures     No action/measure \n \nThere are significant benefits to be gained from gender equitable involvement in LBES approaches to road construction and \nmaintenance. In addition to improving access, which will have much longer-term gender benefits in project of improving \neducation and health status of women (in addition all community members will also be able to access health-care services \nespecially during emergencies), the gender outcomes of the project will largely be linked with women\u2019s participation in LBES \nactivities.   \n \nIII.
