INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will analyze measures to lower \ncontribution to and minimize the impact of climate change in Ningxia, People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC) using science and technology. The TA was requested by the Government of Ningxia Hui \nAutonomous Region (NHAR). The NHAR is one of the regions in the PRC with highest carbon \ndioxide (CO ) intensity per gross domestic product because of the predominance of the coal and \n2\nchemical industries. It is also prone to the vagaries of climate change impacts  because of \nincreased drought and constrained water supply from the Yellow River, affecting agriculture \nactivities. This TA will study appropriate scientific methods and processes to measure and \nstrengthen climate responsiveness in the following three primary economic sectors in Ningxia: \nagriculture, energy, and heavy industries.1 \n \n2.  Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, one of the five minority autonomous regions in the PRC, \nis located inland in the northwestern PRC and along the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow \nRiver. Ningxia covers an area of 66,400 square kilometers and includes five prefecture-level cities. \nIn 2019, the population was 6.947 million. Ningxia is a dry region and mainly depend on water \nfrom the Yellow River for domestic, agricultural, and industrial activities. The region\u2019s public health, \nfood security, and industrial sustainability are threatened by high air and water pollution and \nclimate change-linked events such as floods and droughts. \n \n3.  Almost the entire population in Ningxia depends on the Yellow River for its water needs. \nIn 2019, a total of 6.9 billion cubic meters of water was consumed in Ningxia, 88% of which was \nfrom the Yellow River. About 5.4% of the total water available in the Yellow River basin (YRB) is \nused for potable water for domestic needs. Agricultural water consumption in the region is 5.927 \nbillion cubic meters, which accounts for 85% of the total water consumption and is used to irrigate \nan area of about 9.1231 million mu.2 The main agricultural crops in Ningxia are corn, wheat, rice, \nand potatoes. The frequent occurrence of extreme weather events such as droughts and floods \nthreaten the livelihoods of the people in the region. \n \n4.  Ningxia is an economically underdeveloped region in comparison with other provinces and \nautonomous regions of the PRC. Its industries are dominated by highly polluting heavy industry,3 \nmanufacturing, and associated logistics activities. In 2018, heavy industries accounted for 79.5% \nof industrial energy consumption in the NHAR. \n \n5.  In  the  14th  Five-Year  Plan,  2021\u20132025,4  it  was  proposed  to  promote  economic \ntransformation  and  green  and low carbon  development through  reform  and  innovation.  An \ninnovation-driven strategy was therefore developed for Ningxia to meet these objectives. This \nstrategy envisions high-quality development in the YRB through (i) developing green industries \nsuch as green and smart agriculture, new materials, clean energy, and ecological tourism; and (ii) \nregulating  the  development  of  enterprises  with  high  carbon  emissions.  This  is  a  major \ndevelopment strategy, and scientific and technological innovation plays an important role in \nsupporting its implementation.5 The Science and Technology Department of Ningxia (STDN), on \n \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) website on 24 \nAugust 2021. \n2  A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 square meters). \n3  Heavy industry refers to the industry that provides the material and technology for many sectors of the national \neconomy. Ningxia\u2019s heavy industry mainly comprises the power, chemical, metallurgical, and nonferrous industries. \n4  Government of the PRC. 2021.

China Daily. 21 November. \n \n ", "2 \nbehalf of the NHAR government, undertakes scientific and technological innovation research work \nin the NHAR. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n6.  Ningxia's  total  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions  exceeded  160  million  tons  CO  \n2\nequivalent in 2016 and 200 million tons of CO  equivalent in 2018, bringing its per capita \n2\nemissions to four times of the PRC's average.6 More than 87% of GHG emissions can be \nattributed to energy sector activities in Ningxia. The breakdown of Ningxia's GHG emissions from \neconomic activities in 2018 is as follows: 70.0% from electricity; 25.0% from industrial production; \n2.5%  from  road  transport;  and  2.5%  from  agriculture,  forestry,  and  services.7 The  NHAR \ngovernment and relevant departments are concerned about addressing climate change impacts \nand reducing emissions intensity, since these emissions negatively affect quality of life and \nsustainable development initiatives. \n \n7.  The quality of water in the YRB is affected by frequent flooding and droughts. The average \nannual rainfall in Ningxia is 289 millimeters, which is less than two-thirds the average value for \nthe YRB, and the average annual surface water evaporation is 1,250 millimeters, one of the \nhighest in the YRB. The distribution of water resources is uneven, with 70%\u201380% of runoff from \nthe Yellow  River concentrated  during June\u2013September  during the  flood season.  Ningxia  is \naffected by drought as well.8 For example, a 2019 drought resulted in crop losses across an area \nof about 355,000 mu. In the flood season of 2019, more than 20 sections of the riverbank \ncollapsed and affected the drinking water supply for the residents in Haiyuan county, Pengyang \ncounty, and Yuanzhou district. In 2016, the Eighth Central Environmental Protection Supervision \nGroup pointed out that the water quality of eight key Yellow River canals in Ningxia, as well as \nfour tributaries of the Yellow River in the region, were categorized inferior. \n \n8.  During the implementation period of the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020, the STDN \n(i) identified issues\u2014such as weak coordination mechanisms between multiple sectors and \nenabling policy frameworks\u2014that affect climate change mitigation and resilience actions, (ii) \ncarried out the reform and innovation of science and technology systems, (iii) formulated and \nissued a series of policy documents, and (iv) promoted a body of knowledge on scientific and \ntechnological innovation. Thus, tackling climate change impacts requires improved streamlining \nof multisector policy development, sourcing and management of funds for research, and technical \nsupport for the green and smart development of key industries. \n \n9.  Uncoordinated multisector approaches in dealing with climate change matters affect the \ndevising of effective responses. Also, inadequate awareness, capacity, and access to networks \nto utilize advancements in science and technology obstruct the implementation of a coordinated \nmultisector  approach.  Moreover,  a  slow  transition  to  green  and  smart  development  in  the \nagriculture, energy, and heavy industries slows down potential benefits from addressing climate \nchange mitigation and resilience in Ningxia. This requires benchmarking studies, developing \nsustainable monitoring mechanisms, and building institutional capacity in Ningxia.
