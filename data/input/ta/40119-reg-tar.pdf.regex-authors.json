The poverty reduction strategy1 which was adopted by the Board in November 1999, makes \nclear that without a strong financial sector, progress toward economic development, and hence \npoverty reduction, is exceedingly difficult. ADB\u2019s medium-term strategy II: 2006\u20132008 (MTS II)2 \nvalidated the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) focus on the financial sector by establishing it as a \ncore ADB priority. Indeed, a healthy financial sector contributes to sustainable economic growth \nand, ultimately, poverty reduction. Essentially, the financial sector connects savers and users of \ncapital and, therefore, functions as the nervous system for most of the world\u2019s economic activities, \nlocally and globally, from the smallest microcredit provided in a rural village to the largest capital \nmarket issuance.  However, in most if not all of its developing member countries (DMCs), the \nfinancial sector is inefficient or inadequate to serve the needs of the economy, which leads to credit \nallocation that is inefficient and not necessarily market-based; consequently, economic growth is \nlimited, employment is stilted, and the indirect benefits to poverty reduction do not occur.   \n \n2.  Consequently, as one of its main activities, ADB undertakes a wide variety of financial \ninstitution (FI) interventions, adding value to the respective FIs through various modes of financing, \ngovernance inputs (generally in the form of board participation as appropriate), and other methods \nof know how transfer and capacity building (generally in the form of technical assistance [TA]). The \nspecifics of each transaction differ, based on the needs, constraints, and opportunities of each \nmarket, institution, and intervention, but in almost every instance, TA is necessary to build stronger \nand deeper FIs, thus improving their potential contributions to their respective financial sectors as \nwell as ADB\u2019s commercial returns (as such targeted FI interventions would subsequently receive or \nhave already received ADB assistance).  \n \n3.  ADB firmly believes that TA that parallels actual ADB investments in the FIs (i) assures the \nbest-needs assessment of the target FIs (given the thorough due diligence involved during the \ninvestment process), (ii) enhances the level of cooperation from the FIs\u2019 management with regard \nto implementation and eventual adoption of the TA, and ultimately (iii) yields the highest potential \nimpact\u2014developmental and commercial\u2014for both the ADB TA as well as investment inputs. \n \n4.  This paper describes a regional TA that ADB will use to support these activities; although \nthe structure of the TA allows ADB flexibility in responding to the specific needs of individual FIs, all \nthe activities funded by the TA support the themes of building stronger, deeper financial institutions, \nand increasing the financial and developmental impacts of ADB\u2019s interventions in four key, pre-\nselected  areas:  (i)  corporate  governance  and  internal  controls,  (ii)  anti-money-laundering  and \nanticorruption efforts, (iii) environmental management system and safeguards, and (iv) small and \nmedium-enterprise (SME) financing strategies.   \n \nII.  ISSUES \nA.  Strategic Approach of ADB for Financial Institution Interventions \n1.  Overview \n \n5.  ADB undertakes FI interventions by working with banks, insurance companies, nonbank \ncredit companies, leasing companies, exchanges, depositories, etc. (together: FI), following two \ndifferent approaches with distinctive goals: \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1999. Fighting Poverty in Asia and the Pacific: The Poverty Reduction Strategy of the Asian Development Bank. \nManila. \n2  ADB. 2006. Medium-Term Strategy II: 2006\u20132008. Manila. \n ", "2   \n \n(i)  development of the financial sector to improve mobilization of savings and extension \nof credit, and  \n \n(ii)  delivery of ADB funds through FIs to real-sector entities that cannot efficiently be \nreached directly by ADB\u2019s operations.  \n \n2.  Public\u2013Private Coordination and Synergies \n \n6.  Specific opportunities are identified by various referrals and through proactive marketing by \nADB\u2019s private sector operations. Both needs analysis and identification of opportunities are natural \nareas of cooperation between the public and private sector departments.  \n \nB.  ADB Private Sector Financial Institutions Interventions and Provision of Additional \nADB Technical Assistance  \n7.  ADB FI interventions via its private sector window include (i) the resolution of specific \nproblem institutions; (ii) the filling of market gaps through creation of new institutions; (iii) the \nprovision  of  regulatory  capital  (equity,  subordinated  debt,  other  capital  instruments)  to  key \ninstitutions to support capital ratios and asset expansion; (iv) the provision of funding (additional \nliquidity, longer tenors, foreign or domestic currencies, etc.) to key institutions to expand assets \nand improve asset\u2013liability management; and (v) targeted onlending programs to priority sectors \nsuch as small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), leasing, agriculture, infrastructure, housing, \ntrade finance, etc. (via debt facilities, partial credit guarantees).  Interventions can take the form of \nlending  (loans,  bonds,  etc.),  equity  investments,  hybrid  instruments  (e.g.,  preferred  stock, \nsubordinated debt, convertible debt, etc.), partial credit and political risk guarantees, and other \nappropriate instruments.   \n \n8.  The FIs with which ADB chooses to work are high-potential institutions that would benefit \nboth from financial assistance, and from strategic and operational improvements provided by ADB \nas part of an ongoing effort of additional know-how transfer and capacity building. ADB has, in line \nwith the MTS II and the various financial sector road maps and country strategies, prioritized four \nareas of such capacity building: (i) corporate governance and internal controls, (ii) anti-money-\nlaundering and anticorruption efforts, (iii) environmental management system and safeguards, and \n(iv) SME financing strategies.  The underdevelopment of these aspects of FIs\u2019 operations in ADB\u2019s \nDMCs constrains their business on a number of different levels: \n \n(i)  Corporate governance and internal controls.  Poor corporate governance in the \nareas  of  risk  management  and  internal  controls  may  take  the  form  of  non-\ntransparent  audit  results,  lack  of  independence  of  audit  or  risk  management \nfunctions, inappropriate credit assignment authority, etc.  All of these can lead to \ndifficulties  in  meeting  listing  requirements  for  initial  public  offerings,  attracting \nstrategic investors, and other activities likely for growing companies.   \n \n(ii)  Anti-money-laundering  and  anticorruption  efforts.  FIs  often  face  potential \nproblems  in  money  laundering,  corruption,  and  fraud,  which  damage  the  FIs \nthemselves  and  also  generate  perceived  risk  to  depositors  and  investors, \nundermining the customer trust that is essential for the growth of sound FIs.3 \n \n(iii)  Environmental  management  system  and  safeguards.  Good  environment \n                                                 \n3  Bartlett, B.  2002.  The Negative Effects of Money Laundering on Economic Development.  Manila: ADB. \n ", "  3\nmanagement  systems,  safeguards,  and  policies  signal  that  a  corporation  will \ncontribute to environmental protection, and is also dedicated to managing risks and \nopportunities intelligently while gaining a long-term competitive business advantage \nin the market.  The development and implementation of such systems and policies, \nhowever, can often prove challenging for FIs to undertake without outside expertise.    \n \n(iv)  SME financing strategies.  Although the SME financing market has huge potential \nfor many FIs, it can often be difficult for the FIs to determine appropriate strategies \nfor penetrating or extending their reach into the market.  Even if they are active in \nthe SME sector, they may lack the appropriate risk management systems to engage \nin these activities responsibly.   \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The purpose and anticipated impact of the TA is to strengthen and deepen the capacity of \nFIs in which ADB makes private sector investments (equity, loans, etc.), by improving corporate \ngovernance,  combating  money  laundering  and  corruption,  improving  environment  and  social \nsafeguards, and improving penetration into the SME market.  These will help ensure that ADB\u2019s \nprivate sector transactions are as high impact as possible.  Appendix 1 presents the design and \nmonitoring framework for this TA.4    \n \n10.  The expected TA outputs will depend on and be customized to the selected institution and \nintervention according to needs of the FI, as collaboratively identified by the FI and ADB.  However, \nany given TA will likely (i) review, formulate, and redraft FIs\u2019 policies and procedures for corporate \ngovernance and internal controls, as well as related workshops; (ii) review, formulate, and redraft \npolicies and procedures against money laundering, terrorism, and corruption, as well as related \ntraining workshops; (iii) hold workshops on environmental safeguards training, as well as help \nformulate policies for such safeguards; and (iv) review, formulate, and redraft an SME financing \nstrategy. Any activity would start only after ADB had received a no-objection in writing to the TA \nfrom the government in the country in which activities under this TA are being conducted. \n \nB.  Selection of Financial Institutions \n11.  The TA will target FIs that are or are expected to become ADB\u2019s borrowers and investees.  \n \n1.  Country Selection \n \n12.  The financial sector in each country has its own needs with respect to ADB\u2019s private sector \nfocus areas.  Such needs assessment, i.e., analysis of a country\u2019s financial sector for shortcomings, \nis based on various sources, including the country strategy program and private sector assessment, \nthird-party research, and bespoke research. These identified needs will be customized within \nADB\u2019s private sector skill set, strategic themes, and focus areas, and will warrant different types of \ninterventions.  \n \n                                                 \n4  Each activity funded by this TA  will have its own development impact framework,  which  will measure ADB\u2019s \nintervention as a whole, i.e., all the various components: (i) in terms of ADB\u2019s additionality, especially the effectiveness \nof the provision of capital to support a particular activity or theme, and of capacity building via the provision of TA; and \n(ii) the effectiveness of market building via the demonstration effect created and others). ADB\u2019s impact development \nframework follows closely that of the other multilateral development banks. PSOP is working on this in close \ncoordination with the Operations Evaluation Department. \n ", "4   \n13.  Strategically, because of their limited size, ADB\u2019s private sector operations will concentrate \non transactions offering the right combination of financial and developmental opportunities, as well \nas likelihood of transaction closure. To increase its impact and readiness to react, ADB has hired \nor seconded dedicated staff for its private sector operations in certain key markets: the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, India, and Thailand (and the Philippines, where ADB has a natural presence). \nOver time, ADB plans to increase its private sector presence further along these lines in other key \nmarkets, including Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Pakistan and Viet Nam. It is in these markets that ADB \nis likely to finance activities initially under the TA. It is hoped that over a period of time and after \ngaining  the  requisite  experience  that  ADB  will  be  able  to  carry  out  activities  in  the  more \nunderserved regions of Asia. \n \n2.  Individual Financial Institution Selection \n \n14.  From  a  business  perspective,  ADB  will  seek  to  calibrate  its  interventions  within  an \nengagement spectrum that balances the variety of selected transactions with varying degrees of (i) \ncommercial risk, (ii) financial return, (iii) development effectiveness, and (iv) opportunistic market \ndemand. The goal of this approach is to achieve a sustainable deal-flow that encompasses robust \nflow transactions, high-impact but higher-risk developmental deals, and responsive interventions \nby  market-driven  requests  from  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  partners.5 It  is  these  criteria  which  will \nultimately guide selection of the individual FIs eligible for intervention and the TA. \n \n15.  Most of ADB\u2019s private sector business is based on direct requests to ADB from the private \nsector. However, ADB does seek to undertake its own business origination by proposing to its \nprivate sector clients certain business opportunities. In addition, there is a certain amount of \nreferral business from existing contacts as well as other multilateral and bilateral development \nbanks. Importantly, regardless of the channel used to select the particular FI (i.e., for ADB\u2019s private \nsector intervention) ADB expects that the selected FIs, once deemed fit for an ADB private sector \ninvestment, would also be assessed and deemed qualified to receive assistance (if required) under \nthe criteria of this proposed TA.  \n \nC.  Methodology and Key Activities \n16.  The methodology and key activities of the TA will depend on the specific institution and \nintervention proposed.  However (understanding that significant latitude exists to provide other \nsupport as necessary), likely activities and sub-activities will include the following: \n \n17.  Corporate Governance and Internal Controls. Funding would be used to do the following:  \n \n(i)   Provide training to senior staff on general corporate governance issue.   \n(ii)   Advise management on internationally accepted best practices for internal controls.   \n(iii)   Examine the FI\u2019s organizational structure, particularly the extent of separation of \nroles  and  responsibilities  between  various  departments  and  risk  management \ngroups or committees in terms of managerial functions; assess whether sufficient \nsafeguards exist to ensure adequate internal controls and oversight.   \n(iv)   Report on observations and recommendations based on best practices, including \n                                                 \n5  ADB\u2019s private sector operations is seeking to duplicate certain successful business models or products (e.g., term \nloans) to increase the flow side of its business and the visibility of ADB and PSOP with respect to private sector \ndevelopment in the market.  This will, in the long term, increase not only ADB\u2019s market standing and acceptance, but \nalso the impact of its interventions, i.e., ADB\u2019s development impact.  In addition, this approach will ensure a healthy \nand steady stream of transactions with a developmental impact, while at the same time bolstering ADB\u2019s long-term \nmarket role and viability.  Furthermore, PSOP also seeks to convert developmental pilot transactions into replicable \nbusiness models and products. \n ", "  5\nrecommending amendments or changes to internal control policies and procedures, \nstreamlining current systems, etc.   \n(v)   Help revise the internal control policies and procedures. \n \n18.  Anti-Money-Laundering and Anticorruption Efforts. Funding would be used to do the \nfollowing:  \n \n(i)   Review and assess the current anti-money-laundering and anticorruption policies \nand procedures.   \n(ii)   Report on observations and recommendations based on best practices, including \nrecommending  amendments  or  changes  to  anti-money-laundering  and \nanticorruption policies and procedures, streamlining current systems, etc.   \n(iii)   Help  revise  the  current  anti-money-laundering  and  anticorruption  policies  and \nprocedures.   \n(iv)   Design  training  and  undertake  a  workshop  on  anti-money-laundering  and \nanticorruption awareness and safeguards.   \n(v)   Help management decide how to approach technology enablement and/or support \nfor suspicious transaction reporting and know-your-customer with respect to anti-\nmoney-laundering efforts. \n \n19.  Environmental Management System and Safeguards. Funding would be used to do the \nfollowing: \n \n(i)   Develop and conduct a workshop on environmental issues and safeguards training.  \nOutputs  could  include:  (a)  training  curriculum  and  materials,  (b)  improved \nunderstanding  and  skills  of  workshop  participants  in  identifying  and  managing \nenvironmental risks and enhanced awareness of potential for expanded business \nopportunities on sustainability products and services, and (c) enhanced awareness \nof  workshop  participants  about  national  environmental  safeguard  policies  and \nrequirements.   \n(ii)   Assist  in  developing  and  drafting  an  environmental  management  system  in \ncompliance with national laws and regulations.  \n \n20.  SME Financing Strategies. Funding would be used to do the following:  \n \n(i)  Review existing SME financing products.  \n(ii)  Review financing and product needs of customer base and other potential customer \nsegments.  \n(iii)  Provide international benchmarks for SME financing and relevant products, and risk \nmitigation and concerns.  \n(iv)  Develop an SME financing strategy.  \n(v)  Help design missing financing products. \n \nD.  Cost and Financing \n21.   The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,350,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a \ngrant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program.6 Appendix 2 presents the indicative cost estimates \nand financing plan.  \n                                                 \n6 It should be noted that the implementation\u2014and cost\u2014of the TA will be left with the selected FI. In other words, ADB \nwill undertake a gap analysis, for instance, with respect to anti-money-laundering, review policies and procedures and \nadvise the FI on the next steps. The FI will then subsequently install new information technology systems based on the \nanalysis undertaken by ADB. \n ", "6   \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  ADB  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  purposes  of  the  TA.  ADB\u2019s  private  sector \noperations department will be responsible for all technical implementation issues. The TA activities \nwill  be  implemented  with  the  assistance  of  international  and  national  consultants  and  firms. \nIndicative terms of reference for the consultants to be hired are provided in Appendix 3 and \nAppendix 4. The consultants will be engaged by ADB by way of single-source selection and in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Single-source selection is required and \njustified for the purposes of the TA as only a small number of international firms with local affiliates \nor specialized local firms can provide the services required in accordance with best international \npractice, be able to provide a \"one-shop\" service, have the local language skills required, and have \nprevious experience in the financial sector in the various countries and with respect to the various \nissues to be covered.     \n \n23.  ADB and each FI receiving the TA will form a project planning and coordination committee, \ncomprising representatives at appropriate levels from the FI and ADB. The coordination committee \nwill  organize  regular  consultative  meetings  and  a  final  dissemination  workshop  followed  by \ndiscussions of the findings.  The FI will nominate appropriate officers and senior managers for the \ntraining component related to environmental and social safeguards. (Appendix 4 presents further \ndetails  on  this  training  component.)  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  24  months  from  the \ncommencement date, which will coincide with the approval date of the TA.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n24.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $1,350,000 on a grant basis for capacity-building for financial \ninstitutions. \n ", "Appendix 1  7\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets and/or  Reporting  and Risks \nIndicators  Mechanisms  \nImpact      Assumptions \n     \nFor FIs with which  Published reports  \u2022  Cooperation from FIs \nADB undertakes    at senior and middle-\ninterventions,  Consultations with FIs    manager levels \nimprove corporate  regarding timely \ngovernance practices  sharing of current \nin the areas of risk  policies and \nmanagement and  procedures  \ninternal controls, anti-  \nmoney laundering  \u2022  Acceptance of \nand anticorruption, as  recommendations to \nwell as environmental  change policies and \nrisk assessment, and  procedures \nimprove strategies \nrelated to penetrating \nthe SME market \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nStrengthen current  Revised policies and  Final recommendations  \u2022  FIs\u2019 willingness to \npolicies and  procedures  to FIs regarding policies  cooperate in the \nprocedures to ensure    and procedures for AML  implementation of \nstrong corporate  Training sessions for  and EMS, and regarding  revised procedures, \ngovernance, and  anti-money  strategy for SMEs  policies, and \nextend reach of FIs  laundering and  strategies  \ninto the SME market  environmental   \n  assessment for  \u2022  FIs\u2019 commitment to \n  senior and middle  implementing the \nmanagers of FIs  enhanced policies, \n  procedures, and \nRevised strategies  strategies, and in \nand tactics for  formulating effective \nreaching the SME  management polices \nmarket  to improve \ngovernance \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \n1.
