Conversely, the \nshare of fossil-fuel burning power generation has increased. India\u2019s \neconomy has grown by 8% per annum in recent years, and the \ncountry  faces  rapidly  growing  energy  needs.  Addressing  the \nenergy challenge is essential for fostering sustainable economic \ngrowth and reducing poverty. \n   \nInvestment Program  The  Himachal  Pradesh  Clean  Energy  Development  Investment \nDescription  Program  (the  Program)  combines  physical  investments  in \nhydroelectric  power  generation  in  Himachal  Pradesh  with \nnonphysical interventions in capacity development. All hydropower \nprojects  will  be  run-of-river  design.  The  capacity  development \ncomponent  will  help  the  principal  Implementing  Agency  (IA)  (i) \nprepare future projects; (ii) implement and administer approved \nprojects; and (iii) monitor, review, evaluate, and report on program \nand project implementation, particularly in regard to compliance \nwith ADB policies and procedures. Additional support will focus on \nfinancial management and accountability, as well as other aspects \nof corporate development of the IA and support for other state \npower sector entities. \n \n  Sector  Road  Map.  In  its  hydropower  policy  (2006),  the \ngovernment  of  Himachal  Pradesh  (GOHP)  opted  to  target  its \ncomparative advantage in hydropower as the key focal point of the \nstate power sector, with planned investments in installed capacity \nbacked by institutional reforms and capacity development. GOHP \nhas outlined a policy agenda for hydropower development in the \nshort to medium term and has developed a comprehensive road \nmap to achieve these goals efficiently. A main pillar of the road \nmap is hydropower project implementation by the state, central \ngovernment, and private sectors, as well as providing enabling \ninfrastructure  such  as  road  access  and  transmission \n ", "ii   \ninterconnections to facilitate hydropower development. The road \nmap also includes institutional changes and stipulates formulating \npolicies and guidelines to assist the sector. \n   \n  Investment  Plan.  The  state\u2019s  overall  hydropower  development \nplan aims to achieve 4,021.5 MW of installed hydropower capacity \nby the end of the 11th Five Year Plan in 2012 as follows. \n \nInstalled   Estimated \nCapacity   Cost \nSector  (MW)    ($ million) \nState Sector       290.5 a    493 \nCentral  Government  2,243.0  3,813 \nand/or Joint Sector b   \nPrivate Sector  1,488.0    2,462 \n      Total    4,021.5    6,768 \nMW = megawatt. \na This figure reflects projects commissioned during the 11th Five Year Plan only. \n632 MW of the 808 total MW intended to be funded under the Investment \nProgram are scheduled for commissioning post 2012. \nb This includes projects developed either by Central Government power sector \nentities alone or jointly with either state or private sector entities. \nSource: Government of Himachal Pradesh. Estimated costs are based on general \n$ per kilowatt cost assumptions. \n \nThe Program\u2019s selected projects will come from the state\u2019s portion \nof the overall hydropower development plan, which includes an \nadditional 810 MW to be commissioned post-2012. \n \n  Capacity Development. Given the considerable investment plans \nfor additional hydropower additions in Himachal Pradesh, there are \ncapacity  development  needs  within  Himachal  Pradesh  Power \nCorporation  Ltd.  (HPPCL),  the  state\u2019s  hydropower  generating \ncompany established in 2006. GOHP owns 60% of HPPCL and \nHimachal  Pradesh  State  Electricity  Board  (HPSEB),  the  state\u2019s \nutility,  owns  40%.  HPPCL  has  sound  engineering  and  project \nconstruction management capabilities, and borrows expertise from \nits parent (one of the better run state utilities). The main goal is to \nensure complete stand-alone capabilities within HPPCL. Identified \ncapacity  development  objectives  of  the  proposed  multitranche \nfinancing  facility  (MFF)  include  a  focus  on  project  preparation, \nimplementation,  and  management,  including  (i)  helping  prepare \nfuture  projects,  (ii) implementing  and  administering  approved \nprojects, and (iii) monitoring, reviewing, evaluating, and reporting \non program and project implementation. Particular emphasis will \nbe  placed  on  adherence  to  ADB  policies,  procedures,  and \nreporting  requirements\u2014including  contract  management, \nprocurement,  disbursements,  safeguards  compliance  and \nmonitoring and reporting systems, as well as support for project \nplanning  and  construction  supervision.  It  will  also  emphasize \nadherence to the national laws, policies and requirements. \n   \n ", "  iii\nFinancial management and accountability will be a second major \nfocus.  Capacity  currently  exists  for  accounting  for  construction \noperations,  but  when  the  first  subproject  begins  generating \nrevenue in 2011, the financial management and accounting needs \nwill  change.  Improved  accounting  and  auditing  systems,  while \nincorporating adequate financial management standards to ensure \nfiduciary oversight of disbursed funds, will commence in 2008.  \n   \nIn addition to project-oriented capacity development, the capacity \ndevelopment  component  will  include  corporate  development \nassistance to HPPCL to broaden its functional expertise as the \nstate\u2019s  power  generating  company.  Developing  HPPCL  into  a \ncorporatized  generation  company,  separate  from  HPSEB,  the \nstate\u2019s current integrated utility, facilitates the unbundling process. \nThis component will address HPPCL\u2019s training needs in state-of-\nthe-art  technologies,  and  for  capacity  in  clean  development \nmechanism (CDM) procedures.  \n   \nA  separate  capacity  development  subcomponent  will  support \nHPSEB. As the state\u2019s transmission utility, HPSEB is responsible \nfor  the  design  and  construction  of  evacuation  systems  from \nhydropower  projects  to  the  transmission  system,  as  well  as \nensuring adequate transmission capacity. ADB will assist HPSEB \nin acquiring an enterprise resource solution to cover all its future \ncomputer accounting and management information system (MIS) \napplications; and in financing the purchase of software, hardware, \ntraining, and initial system maintenance to improve management \nreporting and operating activities. ADB is also considering assisting \nHPSEB with its transmission system master plan separately from \nthis MFF (with technical assistance preparation in progress). \n \n  Himachal Pradesh Power Sector. The power sector of Himachal \nPradesh ranked 7th out of 29 in a state power sector performance \nrating study mandated by the Government. Key aspects evaluated \nto  determine  the  ratings  were  state  governments\u2019  progress  in \nimplementing the key provisions of the Electricity Act, 2003, and in \nobtaining rural electrification; the quality of the regulatory process; \nbusiness  and  financial  risk  analysis;  progress  in  attaining \ncommercial viability; and the creation of a competitive environment. \nNoted  strengths  for  Himachal  Pradesh  include  satisfactory \nprogress in the area of distribution reforms, particularly metering \nand  energy  accounting,  and  achievement  of  100%  rural  and \nconsumer electrification. Himachal Pradesh is one of the few states \nwhere energy delivered to consumers is 100% metered, and its \ndistribution system has a high 97.4% availability. \n  \n  Himachal Pradesh has achieved more than 90% metering of its \ndistribution transformers and on feeders up to 33 kilovolts (kV), \nresulting in transmission and distribution losses of a comparatively \nlow  16.4%,  and  aggregate  technical  and  commercial  losses  of \nabout  26%.  Also  noted  were  (i)  a  strong  regulatory  process, \n ", "iv   \nincluding timely issuance of tariff orders and regular monitoring of \nperformance standards and compliance; and (ii) significant steps \ntaken to implement various provisions of the Electricity Act, 2003. \nThe state\u2019s independent regulator, Himachal Pradesh Electricity \nRegulatory Commission (HPERC), began issuing tariff orders in \nOctober  2001.  The  main  features  of  its  tariff  orders  are  the \nadoption  of  a  cost-to-serve  model  for  tariff  determination  to \nrationalize  tariffs  across  various  consumer  categories,  reducing \ncross subsidies, and introducing tariff-based incentives to reduce \ntransmission and distribution losses further. \n   \nRationale  Himachal  Pradesh  is  a  small  mountainous  state  with  abundant \nwater resources in the five major rivers flowing through the state \nfrom the western Himalayas. The power generation potential of \nHimachal  Pradesh  is  20,415  MW\u2014about  25%  of  India\u2019s  total \nhydropower potential\u2014out of which about 6,150 MW has been \ndeveloped.  Recognizing  the  state\u2019s  comparative  advantage  in \nhydropower  generation,  the  main  strategy  of  GOHP  is  the \ndevelopment of Himachal Pradesh as the \u201chydropower state\u201d of \nIndia.  Harnessing  this  hydropower  is  vital  to  meet  all  in-state \ndemand by providing affordable, reliable power to its residents as \nthe state currently meets only about 50% of its power demand \nthrough  its  own  power  generating  capacity.  Harnessing  this \nhydropower will also enable the export of excess power to the rest \nof the country for the benefit of poorer and power deficient states. \nHimachal  Pradesh\u2019s  focus  on  clean  energy  development  will \nprovide jobs to state residents and will further the country\u2019s goal of \nmeeting  its  energy  needs  through  clean,  indigenous  sources. \nFurthermore, the Program will meet capacity development needs \nto further improve the state\u2019s power sector. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  Impact. The impact of the Program will be a sustainable electricity \nsector in Himachal Pradesh and improved state finances. \n \nOutcome. The outcome of the program will be increased clean \nenergy production through run-of-river hydropower schemes, as \nwell  as  improved  planning,  implementation,  management  and \npower sector governance.  \n   \nProgram Investment  The Program\u2019s selected projects will come from the state\u2019s portion \nPlan   of the overall hydropower development plan and are expected to \ntotal about 808 MW. The estimated cost of these selected projects \nis about $1.5 billion. \n   \n ", "  v\n \nFinancing Plan  Financing Plan for the Investment Program \n($ million) \nSource  Amount    % \nAsian Development Bank  800.0    53.3\nOther Financial Institutions   250.0    16.7\nGovernment  450.0    30.0\n  Total    1,500.0    100.0\nSource: Himachal Pradesh Power Corporation Limited and Asian Development \nBank estimates. \n   \nMultitranche Financing  The  Government  has  asked  ADB  to  extend  financing  of \nFacility  $800 million over 8 years through an MFF. The MFF supports a \nwell-defined  clean  energy  investment  program  underpinned  by \ncontinued institutional reform and a delineated sector road map. It \nwill  allow  financing  of  individual  subprojects  as  projects  and \nconditions warrant, by linking financing to project readiness and \ncapacity.  \n \n  The MFF is a suitable modality for this Program as it allows ADB to \nengage with GOHP in a continuous long-term dialogue consistent \nwith  the  Government\u2019s  and  ADB\u2019s  clean  energy  policies,  and \nprovides up-front support to GOHP for its substantial clean energy \ndevelopment program, but with financial commitments sequenced \nto match project readiness. As the sequenced investments are all \nrun-of-river  hydropower  projects,  expertise  will  build  over  time, \nallowing future subprojects to benefit directly from implementation \nexperience  gained  from  the  initial  investments  and  from  the \ncapacity development component. \n \n  Specific subprojects have been earmarked for the first and second \ntranches  as  well  as  future  tranches,  although  others  from  the \nstate\u2019s  investment  plan  may  be  substituted  in  future  tranches \nprovided  they  meet  the  eligibility  criteria.  The  tentative \nimplementation  schedule  of  the  MFF  envisages  five  tranches \ncovering  physical  investments  in  hydropower  generation  and \nnonphysical investments in the form of a capacity development \ncomponent.  \n \n  The MFF transaction is accompanied by the tranche 1 periodic \nfinancing request (PFR) to finance two subprojects consisting of \nhydropower  generation  facilities  which  are  ready  for \nimplementation, plus the capacity development component. The \ntotal cost of the first tranche subprojects and capacity development \namounts  to  $224.8  million.  HPPCL  requested  ADB  to  provide \n$150 million as a first tranche loan. Due diligence in key areas, \nsuch as technical, economic, financial, and safeguards, has been \ncompleted for tranche 1. \n   \n ", "vi   \n \nFramework Financing  India has entered into a financing framework agreement (FFA) with \nAgreement  ADB. Before ADB accepts a PFR under the FFA, the Government, \nGOHP, and the EA will ensure full compliance with the terms and \nconditions of the FFA. The capacity development component will \nprovide  support  if  necessary.  ADB  will  evaluate  all  funding \nrequests, and will ensure that they adhere to representations made \nand will continue to do so. ADB will provide ongoing guidance to \nthe Indian authorities, and make available additional experts under \nthe  capacity  development  component  if  needed.  ADB  staff  will \nreport to ADB Management and ADB\u2019s Board of Directors on the \nstatus  of  individual  loans,  including  the  performance  on \nrepresentations  and  warranties.  Failure  to  comply  with \nrepresentations and warranties entitles ADB to hold back additional \nfinancing under the MFF. \n   \nPeriodic Financing  The MFF transaction is accompanied by one PFR as tranche 1. \nRequests   \nPFR  1:  Hydropower  Facility  Construction  and  Capacity \nDevelopment. This tranche includes clean power development via \nconstruction of the 111 MW Sawra Kuddu Hydroelectric Project \nlocated on the Pabber river in Shimla district of Himachal Pradesh. \nConstruction  activities  include  underground  powerhouses, \nassociated civil works, river diversion, electromechanical works, \nand power evacuation systems. This tranche also includes the civil \nworks for the 65 MW Kashang I Hydroelectric Project, including the \ncommon power house for the Kashang I, II and III Projects, located \non tributary streams of the Sutlej river in Kinnaur district. (The \nKashang I electromechanical works and the Kashang II and III \nprojects are expected to be covered under the second tranche \nsuch that the Kashang I, II and III Projects total 195 MW.) These \nsubprojects, as well as all other subprojects earmarked for future \ntranches, are run-of-river design. The first tranche loan will also \ninclude the $12 million capacity development component. \n   \nAmount and Terms  The MFF will provide up to $800 million from the ordinary capital \nresources of ADB, with final terms and conditions to be established \nunder  individual  loan  agreements  based  on  prevailing  ADB \npolicies.  \n \nPursuant to the FFA, the Government has submitted one PFR to \nADB totaling $150 million for tranche 1. This PFR is presented to \nthe Board with the report and recommendation of the President for \nthe MFF and the FFA. The tranche 1 loan will have a principal \nrepayment period of 25 years, which includes a grace period of \n5 years.  However,  each  future  tranche  may  be  financed  under \nterms different from the financing terms of previous or subsequent \ntranches. Financing will be made available under ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility.  The \nGovernment can choose from eligible currencies and interest rate \nregimes, which can change with each loan. Currency and interest \n ", "  vii\nrate  swaps  will  be  made  available  during  the  financing  period. \nRepayment schedules can be structured to satisfy the needs of \nindividual  loans.  Each  tranche  under  the  MFF  will  be  at  least \n$40 million. \n   \nAllocation and  The  Government  will  provide  the  proceeds  of  each  tranche  to \nRelending Terms  GOHP and will cause the proceeds to be applied to the financing of \nexpenditures  on  the  subprojects  and  the  capacity  development \ncomponent in accordance with the conditions set forth in the FFA \nand  the  legal  agreements  for  each  tranche.  GOHP  will  onlend \nfunds to HPPCL under arm\u2019s-length terms to ensure commercial \ndiscipline. \n   \nAdvance Procurement  To  expedite  implementation,  the  Government  and  GOHP \nand Retroactive  requested  ADB\u2019s  approval  to  carry  out  advance  action  for \nFinancing  procurement of works and goods, and recruitment of consultants. \nThis advance procurement action is intended to be used in all \ntranches  of  the  MFF.  The  Government  and  GOHP  have  also \nrequested retroactive financing arrangements to apply to the MFF \nto  cover  incurred  project  expenses  in  accordance  with  ADB \nprocedures. ADB granted approval of advance contracting, and \napproval  for  retroactive  financing  on  10  March  2008.  The \nGovernment, the EA and the implementing agency (IA) have been \ninformed that approval of advance action does not commit ADB to \napprove  any  of  the  individual  tranches  or  to  finance  the \nprocurement  costs.  Except  as  otherwise  agreed  with  ADB,  the \nexpenditures incurred for equipment, civil works, and consulting \nservices  will  be  eligible  for  retroactive  financing,  provided  that \nthese  are  incurred  before  the  effectiveness  of  the  related  loan \nagreement, but not earlier than 12 months preceding the signing of \nthe related loan agreement, and as long as they do not exceed an \namount of 20% of the individual loan. The Government and the EA \nhave  been  informed  that  ADB  will  not  finance  expenditures \nincurred  prior  to  effectiveness  of  individual  tranches,  even  if \nadvance  contracting  was  approved,  unless  retroactive  financing \nhas also been approved. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  The ADB-supported investment program will be implemented over \n8 years, including procurement and construction activities. Each \nspecific  loan  will  have  its  own  closing  date  to  match  its \nimplementation period. The first PFR was signed on 11 September \n2008. \n   \nEstimated Program  30 September 2016 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  The Multipurpose Projects (MPP) and Power Department of GOHP \nis  the  EA  with  overall  responsibility  for  the  execution  of  the \nInvestment Program and subprojects. HPPCL was established by \nthe state government, and it is mandated to develop and operate \nnew hydropower plants in the state. HPPCL will function as the \n ", "viii   \nprincipal IA for the proposed MFF, with responsibility for the day-to-\nday  coordination,  implementation,  and  administration  of  the \nsubprojects. Each of the hydropower projects will have a separate \nfield office to facilitate its smooth functioning. They will function as \nproject management units (PMUs) at the field level and there will \nbe a central PMU within HPPCL\u2019s head office. For the capacity \ndevelopment subcomponent earmarked for HPSEB, HPSEB will be \nthe IA. \n   \nImplementation  HPPCL will appraise additional subprojects following approval of \nArrangements  the MFF. HPPCL will also undertake detailed design, procurement, \nconstruction  supervision,  commissioning,  maintenance,  and \noperation of the subprojects. Technical support from consultants \nand contractors will be employed as necessary with funding from \nthe capacity development component budget. HPPCL will liaise \nwith ADB on a regular basis. \n \n  The PMU, through the related IA offices, will be responsible for \nprocessing and implementing the subprojects. It will be assisted by \ntechnical experts who will evaluate the technical reports, feasibility \nstudies,  preliminary  design  reports,  environmental  assessment \nreports, resettlement and indigenous peoples development plans, \nand detailed design reports to ensure compliance with ADB and \ngovernment  requirements.  Summary  appraisal  reports  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB subsequent to GOHP approval and necessary \ngovernment clearances.  \n   \nProcurement  Equipment, materials, and civil works to be financed under each \nloan  of  the  MFF  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time), \nmainly through international and/or national competitive bidding. \nAdvance  procurement  will  be  allowed  to  facilitate  timely \nimplementation of the investments.   \n   \nConsulting Services  Consulting services are required to provide support to HPPCL for \nproject  implementation  work,  including  design,  supervision  of \nconstruction, management for the subprojects under the tranche 1 \nloan, and for feasibility studies of future loans. Consulting services \nwill be provided for evaluation, monitoring, and reporting purposes. \nIn  addition,  consultants  will  support  the  capacity  building \ncomponent under the tranche 1 loan. Consultants will be selected \nand engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Consulting \nfirms will be selected using the quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod and simplified technical proposal. Individual experts may \nalso  be  recruited  based  on  biodata  submitted  in  response  to \nspecific terms of reference for assignments. \n   \nBenefits and  The first group of beneficiaries will be local electricity consumers. \nBeneficiaries under the  Electricity  from  the  proposed  hydropower  plants  under  the \nMFF  Investment  Program  will  go  directly  to  the  local  grid  (only  the \n ", "  ix\nsurplus will be exported to the national grid), thus helping to fulfill \nlocal demand for greater energy resources. Power consumption \nwithin  the  state  consists  of  about  25%  domestic  users,  7% \ncommercial users, 59% industrial or bulk supply, and 9% irrigation \nand agricultural use. The MFF is expected to result in more reliable \npower to consumers, and will lower the cost of supplying power in \nthe state by relying more on in-state power generation. Industry is \nthe largest consumer of electricity in Himachal Pradesh, and the \nshare of industry to state domestic product has increased from \n1.1% in FY1951 to 15.9% in FY2004. As the dust-free and cool \nclimate  of  Himachal  Pradesh  is  suitable  for  the  electronic  and \nprecision industries, electronic complexes have been established. \nThese industries are expected to benefit from rationalized power \ntariffs.  \n \n  The second group of beneficiaries will be through job creation as a \nresult of the Investment Program. For example, the contractors are \nexpected to hire skilled and unskilled workers for the projects\u2019 civil \nworks. There will also be jobs available beyond the construction \nphase throughout the projects\u2019 life cycles. GOHP has a policy that \n70% of hired labor must be hired from within the state. \n \n  Third,  local  communities  in  the  project  areas  will  benefit  from \nsocioeconomic development programs financed through GOHP\u2019s \npolicy of allocating 1.5% of total project costs to the community, \nwith  the  funds  to  be  administered  by  local  area  development \ncommittees  led  by  community  leaders  (these  are  government \nfunds  outside  of  the  MFF).  These  funds  will  be  earmarked  for \nsmall-scale  projects  benefiting  the  affected  communities  as \ndecided by the committees. \n \n  Clean energy development as promoted by this MFF will contribute \nto local, regional, and global environmental initiatives. In addition, \nthe  Program  will  benefit  all  national  grid-connected  electricity \nconsumers via the export of excess power, and by eliminating or \nreducing the need for Himachal Pradesh to import power from the \nnational grid, thus enabling the Government to meet its objective of \ndeveloping the hydropower potential in the country. \n \nRisks and Assumptions  The key broad assumptions under the Program are as follows: \n(i) macroeconomic growth will remain stable; (ii) GOHP remains \ncommitted to power sector reforms and institutional improvement; \nand  (iii)  GOHP  executes  its  investment  plan,  successfully \ncombining  physical  infrastructure  investments  with  nonphysical \ninvestments  in  capacity  development  to  maintain  a  sustainable \npower sector. Broad risks to the Investment Program include a \nslowdown in the depth and pace of policy and sector reforms, \nincluding  those  related  to  regulation,  governance,  financial \nmanagement, institutional change, and tariff regimes. \n \n  These  risks  can  be  mitigated  through  political  commitment, \n ", "x   \nconcerted action, and sound supervision. GOHP is fully committed \nto expand its power supply and continue with sector reforms. The \nreforms  include  further  tariff  reform,  improved  corporate \ngovernance,  institutional  change,  and  increased  private  sector \nparticipation. The state is closely following the execution of the \nlong- and medium-term plans for the sector, where hydropower \ndevelopment has a prominent role, and recognizes that capacity \ndevelopment  is  a  major  part  of  the  process.  GOHP  is  also \ncommitted  to  the  adequate  development  of  the  transmission \nnetwork in the state, for which a separate transmission utility has \nbeen envisaged.  \n \n  More specific, subproject-related assumptions under the Program \nare: (i) the commitment of HPPCL to construct and operate the \nhydropower  projects  in  a  timely  manner  and  maintain  proper \nimplementation supervision, including implementation of safeguard \nplans; (ii) no material delay in concluding tariffs for the projects \nand/or on appropriate arrangements for the sale of excess power; \n(iii)  GOHP  continues  to  support  capacity  development  and \nassumes ownership of the proposed MFF\u2019s capacity development \ncomponent;  and  (iv)  the  subprojects  will  be  eligible  for  CDM \nfinancing (purchase of carbon credits) and the CDM is extended \nbeyond its 2012 end date.  \n \n  Specific  subproject-related  risks  include  delays  in  recruiting \nconsultants and in the procurement process. Another risk is the \nlack of, or delay in, counterpart funding including funds to the state \ntransmission  utility  for  construction  of  the  transmission \ninterconnections  and  required  transmission  lines.  Construction \nrisks include an increase in project costs and the implementation \ntime frame caused by (i) implementation issues (the greatest risk \nbeing due to encountering unexpected poor geological conditions); \n(ii) commodity price increases (such as cement, steel, fuel, and \nother  raw  materials)  that  affect  cost  estimates;  or  (iii)  poor \ncontractor  performance.  However,  the  structures  are  of \nconventional design and require special but common construction \npractices,  and  the  equipment  is  of  conventional  design  and \nmanufacturing capability. In all, the works require highly qualified \ncivil works contractors and equipment manufactures. This can be \nachieved  through  rigid  application  of  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  for \nqualification of contractors and consultants and close monitoring of \nthe contracts.  \n \n  Overall,  the  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to \noutweigh the costs, given the likelihood of the risks occurring. \n \nUndertakings  Himachal Pradesh has a well-defined power sector road map, a \nclear  investment  and  capacity  development  program,  and  the \npeople and institutions to deliver on the objectives and targets. The \nprovision of ADB finance through an MFF requires an agreement \non  key  undertakings,  which  are  intended  to  ensure  program \n ", "  xi\nsuccess. The assurances outlined in this document are reflected in \nlegal  documentation,  covering  critical  covenants,  including  (i) \nproper implementation and evaluation, (ii) providing its share of \nfinancing  according  to  the  financing  plan,  (iii) proper  fiduciary \noversight (including financial as well as business process audits), \n(iv) proper governance measures, and (v) capacity and institutional \ndevelopment. In addition, the FFA captures provisions for ADB \nfinancing,  including  (i)  subproject  eligibility  criteria;  (ii)  following \nsafeguards  frameworks;  (iii) procurement  and  disbursement \nprocedures;  (iv)  financial  management;  and  (v)  monitoring, \nadministration, and reporting.  \n \n  ADB will provide support to the EA and IA responsible for program \nimplementation, from headquarters and potentially through the India \nResident Mission.   \n \nEach new financing request to be converted into a new loan will \nrequire an evaluation of the performance of the previous one. ADB \nwill  conduct  periodic  review  missions,  which  will  include  due \ndiligence  on  representations  and  warranties  made  to  ADB.  In \naddition, staff will report on any issues or problems faced by the \nauthorities  and  the  EA,  and  the  remedial  actions  suggested  to \novercome them. \n \n ", "", " \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  to  India  for  the  Himachal  Pradesh  Clean  Energy \nDevelopment Investment Program.1  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Background, Performance Indicators, and Analysis \n2.  India\u2019s economy has grown by 8% per annum in recent years, and faces rapidly growing \nenergy needs. Addressing the energy challenge is essential for fostering sustainable economic \ngrowth and reducing poverty. Taking into account India\u2019s energy security concerns and the \nenvironment,  the  Government  of  India  (the  Government)  developed  the  integrated  energy \npolicy2 in 2006. The policy\u2019s goal is to ensure adequate and reliable energy supplies in a \ntechnically  efficient,  economically  viable,  and  environmentally  sustainable  manner.  Specific \nmeasures  include  (i) optimizing  the  power  supply  mix,  including  greater  use  of  indigenous \nhydropower resources and renewable energy; (ii) pursuing technologies that maximize energy \nefficiency,  demand-side  management,  and  conservation;  and  (iii)  continuing  related  power \nsector reforms, including reducing technical and commercial losses of the state transmission \nand distribution utilities and other restructuring efforts.  \n \n3.  The Electricity Act, 2003, is the cornerstone legislation for the power sector in India. The \nact primarily mandates continued restructuring of state electricity boards, full metering for all \nconsumer classes, open access to transmission systems, facilitation of power trading, and tariff \nrationalization. The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) has prescribed detailed \nrules for cost accounting and allowable tariffs. In addition, India\u2019s 11th Five Year Plan (FYP) \naims to ensure electricity connections to all villages and below poverty level households by \n2009, and provide round-the-clock power service by the end of 2012 to meet the Government\u2019s \n\u201cPower For All By 2012\u201d commitment. The 11th FYP also aims to increase generation capacity \nby  78,500  megawatts  (MW),  reduce  aggregate  technical  and  commercial  losses,  increase \nenergy efficiency, promote low-carbon energy sources, and increase private sector participation. \n \n4.  To  ensure  energy  security  for  the  country,  India  has  decided  to  fully  develop  all \ndomestically available energy options. Though India has abundant reserves of coal and coal \nshall remain an important source for power generation in the medium term, India has also \ndecided to tread a low carbon path for meeting energy needs, including thermal power projects \ndeploying more efficient, super critical technology, gas based power generation (dependent \nupon the availability and pricing of gas) and nuclear power (dependent upon the access to \ncivilian nuclear technology and availability of fuel.  With about 9,000 MW of installed capacity, \nIndia is the world\u2019s 4th largest producer of wind power. To address climate change issues, India \nhas drawn up a National Action Plan, which includes solar power promotion. India is also giving \nemphasis to the conservation of energy. \n \n5.  India  is  also  endowed  with  enormous  economically  viable  hydropower  potential. \nConventional hydropower capacity is assessed to be about 84,000 MW at 60% load factor (or \n140,000 MW installed capacity). Only about 21% of India's hydroelectric potential has been \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government of India Planning Commission. 2006. Integrated Energy Policy: Report of the Expert Committee. \nNew Delhi. \n ", "2   \nharnessed to-date and another 10% is under development. The Government recognizes the \nimportance of increasing the share of hydropower generation in the energy mix and introduced \nthe \u201c50,000 MW Hydropower Initiative\u201d in 2003. Under this initiative, the hydro-rich states, \nincluding Himachal Pradesh, are given special incentives to promote hydropower development.  \n \n6.  In  order  to  further  address  the  rehabilitation  and  resettlement  issues  linked  to  the \nconstruction of the country\u2019s hydropower resources, the Government of India has announced \nthe New Hydro Policy 2008. This policy provides a level playing field to private developers, and \nelucidates  transparent  selection  criteria  to  be  used  by  states  for  awarding  sites  to  such \ndevelopers. The policy enables developers to earn revenues through merchant sales up to a \nmaximum  of  40%  of  saleable  energy  with  the  balance  to  be  sold  under  long-term  power \npurchase agreements. The policy seeks to balance incentives for private developers while \ncontaining provisions designed to ensure that benefits flow to the project-affected persons.  \n \n7.  Himachal Pradesh, a small mountainous state with a population of slightly over 6 million, \nhas abundant water resources in the five major rivers flowing through the state from the western \nHimalayas. The power generation potential of Himachal Pradesh is 20,415 MW, which is about \n25% of the total hydropower potential of India, out of which around 6,150 MW has been \ndeveloped. Recognizing the state\u2019s comparative advantage in hydropower generation, the main \nstrategy of the government of Himachal Pradesh (GOHP), outlined in its state hydropower \npolicy,3 is to become the \u201chydropower state\u201d of the country, by providing affordable, reliable \npower to its residents, and selling excess power to the national grid as a major source of \nrevenue  for  the  state.  A  new  corporate  entity,  Himachal  Pradesh  Power  Corporation  Ltd. \n(HPPCL), has been established by GOHP and it is mandated to develop and operate new \nhydropower plants in the state.  \n \n8.  The power sector of Himachal Pradesh ranked seventh out of 29 in a state power sector \nperformance rating study mandated by the Government.4 Key aspects evaluated to determine \nthe  ratings  were  state  governments\u2019  progress  in  implementing  the  key  provisions  of  the \nElectricity Act, 2003, and in obtaining rural electrification, the quality of the regulatory process, \nboth business and financial risk analysis, progress in attaining commercial viability, and the \ncreation  of  a  competitive  environment.  Noted  strengths  for  Himachal  Pradesh  include \nsatisfactory  progress  in  the  area  of  distribution  reforms,  particularly  metering  and  energy \naccounting, and achievement of 100% rural and consumer electrification. Himachal Pradesh is \none  of  the  few  states  where  energy  delivered  to  consumers  is  100%  metered,  and  its \ndistribution system has a high 97.4% availability. Furthermore, Himachal Pradesh has achieved \nmore than 90% metering of its distribution transformers and on feeders up to 33 kilovolts (kV), \nresulting in transmission and distribution losses of a comparatively low 16.3%. Also noted were \n(i) a strong regulatory process, including timely issuance of tariff orders and regular monitoring \nof performance standards and compliance; and (ii) significant steps taken to implement various \nprovisions of the Electricity Act, 2003. The state\u2019s independent regulator, Himachal Pradesh \nElectricity  Regulatory  Commission  (HPERC),  began  issuing  tariff  orders  in  October  2001. \nSalient features of its tariff orders are the adoption of a cost-to-serve model to determine tariffs \nin order to rationalize tariffs across various consumer categories,5 reducing energy charges of \nindustrial consumers to reduce cross-subsidies, and the introduction of a high-voltage rebate \n                                                 \n3  Government of Himachal Pradesh. 2006.

Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Physical Constraints \n9.  Generation. The electricity supply for the people of Himachal Pradesh comes from its \nown state sector resources and allocated share of central sector-owned generation within the \nstate. The installed capacity of the state sector, which is predominantly hydropower, is 523 MW \nas of March 2007. Himachal Pradesh experiences energy shortages, especially in the winter \nmonths of December to February when river flows are at their lowest, although some peak \nshortages are experienced throughout the year.7 Currently, it is able to meet about 50% of \ndemand from its own resources. During power shortages, the state must draw power from the \nnational grid, depending on the system conditions. Conversely, the state supplies power to the \nnational grid when generating excess hydropower during peak river flow periods.8 \n \n10.  According to the 17th Electric Power Survey,9 power demand in Himachal Pradesh is \nexpected to increase from 4,861 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in 2006 (824 MW peak) to 9,504 GWh \n(1,611  MW  peak)  by  2012  and  to  13,136  GWh  (2,194  MW  peak)  by  2017.  This  implies \ncompound average growth rates of energy demand of 11.37%  from 2006 to 2011 and 6.69% \nfrom 2012 to 2017. To meet this growing demand, GOHP\u2019s hydropower development plans \nmust fructify. As both the central sector and private investors are interested in developing \nhydropower  in  Himachal  Pradesh  for  export  to  the  national  grid,  the  capacity  additions \nearmarked for the state sector will serve local customers throughout the year, with excesses \nduring peak hydropower periods exported.  \n \n11.  Transmission.  The  state\u2019s  transmission  assets  consist  of  2,100  kilometers  (km)  of \ntransmission lines rated 66 kV and above, and about 100 power transformers aggregating to \naround 2,000 megavolt-amperes (MVA) of capacity. The transmission network in Himachal \nPradesh is part of the northern regional grid, which is operating in synchronous mode with the \neastern,  north  eastern,  and  western  regional  grids  (collectively,  the  national  grid).  These \nphysical interconnections enable Himachal Pradesh to exchange power with these regions, \ndepending on the daily power supply balance. With considerable hydropower capacity additions \nin various stages of planning, development, and construction, additional transmission capacity \nwill be needed to transmit the additional power out of state. \n \n12.  Distribution. In 1988, Himachal Pradesh became the first hill state to achieve 100% \nelectrification  of  all  census  villages\u2014an  impressive  accomplishment  given  the  dispersed \ncustomer  base  and  mountainous  terrain.  Presently,  Himachal  Pradesh  has  around  19,000 \ndistribution transformers, 28,000 km of high-tension lines, and 50,000 km of low-tension lines. In \nmeeting the Government\u2019s requirements on energy efficiency and reduced system losses, it is \nessential that every unit generated and delivered is accounted for and audited at different \nvoltage levels. Himachal Pradesh has achieved more than 90% metering on the distribution \ntransformers and on the feeders up to 33 kV, and though its transmission and distribution losses \nare a comparatively low 16.4%, with aggregate technical and commercial losses of about 26%, \n                                                 \n6  FY2007 tariff order. \n7   In FY2008, Himachal Pradesh experienced a 1.8% energy shortage, with larger shortages in previous years. \n8   Peak hydropower generation occurs from April to October because of strong river flows from the spring snowmelt. \n9   The Central Electricity Authority periodically publishes electric power surveys, which include power sector data and   \nforecasts gathered from all sector agencies to be used for planning purposes. \n ", "4   \nthe next step is to achieve 100% metering at the distribution transformer and feeder level to \nassist in further reducing this aggregate technical and commercial loss figure. \n \n2.  Capacity Development \n13.  Given  the  considerable  investment  plans  for  additional  hydropower  additions  in \nHimachal Pradesh and the central role of HPPCL, capacity development is required. HPPCL \nwas formed in 2006 and its assets are derived from merging two existing state corporations, \nwhich were formed to develop and construct two hydropower projects. It is owned 60% by \nGOHP and 40% by the state\u2019s utility, Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board (HPSEB). \nHPPCL has sound engineering and project construction management capabilities, and borrows \nexpertise from its parent (one of the better run state utilities). HPPCL\u2019s organization structure is \nin  Appendix  3.  Its  capacity  development  needs  include  enhanced  project  planning  and \nmanagement, as well as improved governance and financial management. \n \n14.  The  state\u2019s  independent  regulator,  HPERC,  has  been  functional  since  2001.  On \n30 October 2007, HPERC sent a separate request to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for \ncapacity  development  assistance,  which  would  be  carried  out  as  separate  technical \nassistance.10 HPERC\u2019s capacity development objectives are to support enhancing institutional \ncapacity, and to promote and update the regulatory framework to address upcoming sectoral \nissues effectively, especially implementation of the multiyear tariff regime11 as mandated by the \nElectricity Act, 2003.  \n \n15.  As the state\u2019s transmission utility, HPSEB is responsible for the design and construction \nof the evacuation systems from hydropower projects to the transmission system, as well as for \nensuring adequate transmission capacity. Ensuring optimum HPSEB performance is also a \ncapacity development objective, given the considerable hydropower investment plans within the \nstate.  \n \n16.  Additional capacity development needs in the state include support for carbon market \ninitiatives, particularly given the substantial hydropower capacity additions planned for the state \nand their ability to offset carbon emissions. Under the project preparatory technical assistance,12 \nADB funded a study to develop a carbon market development strategy for Himachal Pradesh, \nwith further assistance to be part of the MFF.  \n \n3.  Private Sector Participation \n17.  In Himachal Pradesh, the state\u2019s aggressive hydropower development objectives cannot \nbe  reached  without  further  private  sector  participation  to  meet  the  sector\u2019s  financing \nrequirements and to enhance operational efficiencies. The Government\u2019s national electricity \npolicy13 and the 11th FYP stress the importance of increased private participation in India\u2019s \npower sector. In Himachal Pradesh, hydropower development was opened up for private sector \nparticipation  in  1991,  with  two  projects  (totaling  386  MW)  already  commissioned.  For  the \n11th FYP (2007\u20132012), 8 hydropower plants with combined capacity of 1,488 MW (37% of \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2007.

New Delhi. \n ", "  5\nplanned capacity additions excluding mini-hydropower) have been identified for private sector \nparticipation, with further additions expected beyond 2012. \n   \n18.  The primary constraints to private sector participation in the past, in Himachal Pradesh \nand elsewhere in India, were complex bidding procedures and a cumbersome clearance and \napproval process. Furthermore, the creditworthiness of state electricity boards was a major \nconcern for independent power producers (IPPs). The state\u2019s hydropower policy addressed \nmany  of  these  concerns,  and  creates  an  enabling  environment  by  containing  bidding \nprocedures and by outlining incentives to attract private investment. The key policy features for \nprivate  sector  participation  are  (i)  procedures  for  selection  of  developers  via  signing \nmemorandums  of  understanding  for  projects  up  to  100  MW,  and  based  on  international \ncompetitive bidding for projects above 100 MW; (ii) no clearances required from the Central \nElectricity Authority for projects selected by a competitive bidding process costing up to $600 \nmillion; (iii) premium sales prices for peak power; and (iv) 100% foreign equity permitted with \nautomatic approval. Furthermore, the introduction of open access and power trading enables \nIPPs to export their power to the national grid, allowing for more flexible and favorable power \nsales arrangements through the open access mechanism. \n \n19.  Another constraint to private sector participation is the very long gestation period when \ndeveloping a hydropower project. The need for detailed hydrology studies, the difficult mountain \nterrain,  often  remote  locations  requiring  construction  of  access  roads,  and  the  numerous \ngovernment  clearances  required  considerably  increase  the  risk  profile  of  investing  private \ncapital into early stage project development. Thus, it can be more practical for an entity such as \nHPPCL to commence the planning process; identify viable sites; conduct the relevant studies; \nand obtain the various engineering, social, and environmental clearances\u2014and, at this later \nstage, leverage private capital and expertise through joint ventures or other public\u2013private \npartnership (PPP) arrangements.  \n   \n4.  Sector Road Map \n20.  GOHP has outlined a policy agenda for hydropower development in the short to medium \nterm,  backed  by  continued  reforms  and  capacity  development,  and  has  developed  a \ncomprehensive road map to achieve these goals efficiently. A main pillar of the road map is \nhydropower project implementation by the state, central government, and private sectors. The \nstate  sector  has  a  goal  of  adding  over  1,100  MW  of  additional  capacity,  with  290.5  MW \ncommissioned by the end of the 11th FYP, and will allocate funds from the state budget to \naccomplish  this.  As  part  of  the  hydropower  policy,  promoting  additional  private  sector \ninvestment in the sector is a key priority, with clear goals for competitive tendering of IPP \nhydropower projects by 2010, with ensuing privately owned capacity additions to follow, as well \nas a planned implementation of pilot PPP arrangements between the state and private sectors. \nAn  additional  state  goal  is  providing  enabling  infrastructure,  such  as  road  access  and \ninterconnection points, to facilitate hydropower development.  \n \n21.  The road map also includes institutional changes and stipulates formulating policies and \nguidelines to assist the sector. The key policy is the state\u2019s hydropower policy. In another \nexample, the state recognizes the need for a formal state environmental policy to ensure that \nthe  state\u2019s  investment  program  follow  a  path  of  sustainable  development  with  built-in \nenvironmental conservation and enhancement measures. \n \n22.  Identified  capacity  development  objectives  include  enhancing  planning  and  financial \nmanagement capabilities, particularly at HPPCL as the state\u2019s hydropower generation company. \n ", "6   \nGOHP identified capacity development needs in implementing ADB-funded investments, such \nas support for design, procurement, contract management, and subproject management, as \nwell  as  developing  expertise  in  environmental  and  social  safeguards  implementation.  This \nproposed MFF\u2019s capacity development component will support these efforts to commercialize \nHPPCL. A matrix that summarizes the sector road map is in Appendix 1. \n \n5.  Asian Development Bank\u2019s Strategy in the Power Sector \n23.  ADB\u2019s assistance for the energy sector as outlined in the 2008 country partnership \nstrategy14 has six main priorities: (i) promotion of higher efficiency, low-carbon energy sources, \ne.g., run-of-river type hydropower projects,15 cleaner fuel, and renewable energy; (ii) expansion \nand optimization of transmission and distribution systems; (iii) sector reforms; (iv) institutional \nstrengthening to implement reforms required by the Electricity Act, 2003, including development \nof more flexible power delivery and trading systems; (v) promotion of private sector participation; \nand (vi) encouraging energy efficiency, energy conservation, rural electrification, and ensuring \nenvironmental and social sustainability. These priorities are generally consistent with those in \nthe previous country strategy and program updates.16 To support the Government\u2019s goals, \nADB\u2019s future strategy for the power sector will be in synergy with India\u2019s 11th FYP. ADB will \ncontinue  to  expand  its  promotion  of  state-level  reforms  by  including  other  states,  and  by \ndeepening  its  efforts  in  states  where  it  is  already  active,  such  as  Assam,  Gujarat, \nMadhya Pradesh,  and  Uttarakhand.  The  proposed  intervention  in  Himachal  Pradesh  is \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  strategy  of  promoting  higher  efficiency,  low-carbon  energy  sources \nthrough run-of-river hydropower investments, as well as institutional strengthening to implement \nreforms as required by the Electricity Act, 2003. \n \n24.  Energy\u2013Environment Nexus. A major strategic challenge in the Asia and Pacific region \nis  meeting  the  rapidly  growing  demand  for  electricity  in  the  most  cost-effective  and \nenvironmentally sustainable way. This is particularly important in India. By its sheer size and \nincreasing weight in the global economy and energy markets, India has a key role to play in \naddressing the global challenge of climate change. It  is  thus  vital  to  address  environmental \nissues in energy sector interventions, and to mitigate environmental impacts through promoting \ncleaner technologies.  \n \n25.  The Government recognizes the importance of energy and related environmental issues. \nClimate  change  is  an  important  consideration  in  India\u2019s  national  plan  and  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. The Ministry of Environment and Forests is the nodal ministry for climate \nchange  and  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism  (CDM).17 Other  relevant  agencies  and \n                                                 \n14 ADB.

Storage facilities use a dam to store the \nwater, which may be released either to meet changing electricity needs or to maintain a constant water level. In \ncontrast, run-of-river plants divert a portion of a river\u2019s current into a diversion channel, pipe and/or tunnel, which is \nthen released through a turbine, and delivered back into the same river downstream. Run-of-river designs can \ninclude weirs or barrages to ensure adequate flow into the pipe or tunnel, particularly at peak periods. However, \nrun-of-river hydropower projects may involve the construction of barrages to ensure adequate flow into the \npenstock or tunnel, particularly at peak periods, and thus may contain pondage predominantly within the existing \nriverbanks. Such barrages allow water and fish passage through the river at all times (unlike storage dams).  \n16 ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program Update (2005\u20132007): India. Manila; ADB. 2005.

The CDM is a market-based financial instrument with the dual purpose of \nassisting developing nations to achieve sustainable development and industrial countries to meet their emission \nreduction targets. The CDM allows industrial countries to invest in \u201cclean\u201d projects in developing countries, \n ", "  7\ninstitutions include the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Bureau of Energy Efficiency and \nthe Technology Information, Forecasting and Assessment Council, with specific mandates to \npromote  climate-friendly  technologies.  The  national  environment  policy18 is  the  framework \ndocument that specifically governs climate change interventions. It provides the basis for the \nintegration of environmental considerations in the policies of various sectors. For the energy \nsector, the Government included measures for increased use of hydropower resources and \nrenewable  energy  in  the  power  supply  mix  in  its  integrated  energy  policy  (footnote  2). \nSpecifically  related  to  hydropower,  the  Government\u2019s  \u201c50,000  MW  Hydropower  Initiative\u201d \npromotes capacity additions in the mountainous states with abundant hydropower resource \npotential to implement physical investments that address the power supply mix.  \n \n26.  At the state level, GOHP\u2019s hydropower policy puts the state at the forefront of India's \nhydropower development efforts. Himachal Pradesh\u2019s investment program, complemented by \nthe proposed MFF, is consistent with government initiatives, as well as a number of ADB \nrecommendations on addressing the energy\u2013environment nexus,19 such as (i) promoting clean, \nrenewable  hydropower;  (ii)  including  a  strong  role  for  private  sector  participation;  and \n(iii) promoting  unbundling  and  restructuring.20 The  carbon  footprint  of  the  energy  sector  in \nHimachal Pradesh is quite small, as nearly all its power generation is produced by emissions-\nfree hydropower and the state has comparatively low aggregate technical and commercial \nlosses, ensuring that power is used efficiently. Given Himachal Pradesh\u2019s sparsely populated, \nmountainous terrain, there is little heavy industry, though there are small but growing electronics \nmanufacturing operations. Himachal Pradesh\u2019s connectivity with the national grid ensures that \nits aggressive hydropower investment program is important in addressing India\u2019s overall energy \nand environmental concerns.  \n \n27.  The sustained dialogue with GOHP enabled by this proposed MFF, as well as ADB \ninterventions  in  other  states,  ensure  ADB  support  in  helping  India  meet  its  considerable \nchallenge. ADB assistance to India encompasses both demand- and supply-related programs to \nenhance the impact of the Government\u2019s initiatives. This will be effectively achieved through a \ncombination of lending and technical assistance instruments. The interventions will include \n(i) renovation and modernization of the existing hydro- and thermal power plants, (ii) upgrading \nof inefficient thermal power plants to enhance their performance, (iii) developing renewable and \nalternative energy sources, (iv) reducing technical and commercial losses in transmission and \ndistribution  networks  and  facilities,  and  (v)  mainstreaming  demand-side  management  and \nenergy  conservation  while  ensuring  environmental  and  social  sustainability.  ADB\u2019s  energy \nefficiency initiative and carbon market initiative will be employed to leverage resources for such \ninterventions and to allow promotion of energy efficiency, renewable energy, and other forms of \nclean energy. For example, ADB has provided base financing for CDM projects across the \nregion  with  pending  carbon  credit  transactions;  and  ADB\u2019s  CDM  facility  provides  parallel \nassistance to projects that can qualify for CDM and to facilitate agreements between sellers or \nproject owners, and buyers of carbon credits.21   \n \n                                                                                                                                                          \ne.g., renewable energy such as hydropower, and to acquire certified emission reductions\u2014generically referred to \nas \u201ccarbon credits\u201d\u2014that can be used to comply with the Kyoto Protocol. Certified emission reductions are the \nofficial commodity generated by CDM projects. One certified emission reduction equals 1 ton of carbon dioxide \nequivalent. \n18 Government of India, Ministry of Environment and Forests. 2006. National Environment Policy 2006.

Clean Development Mechanism Facility. http://www.adb.org/CDMF/ \n ", "8   \n6.  Lessons  \n28.  In the past, ADB extended assistance to distinct power projects in various states, as well \nas to the central power sector agencies. Since 1986, ADB has provided 33 loans totaling over \n$6.2 billion to the overall energy sector, with 19 loans totaling over $4.2 billion specifically to the \npower sector. A detailed list of ADB assistance to the sector, including individual and total loan \namounts, is in Appendix 4. Although this policy enabled ADB to support many projects, ADB\u2019s \nresources were spread too thin. As a result, ADB could not fully achieve its desired goal of \npolicy reforms with its power sector borrowers. Since 2000, ADB has focused its lending on \nstates committed to reforming and restructuring their power sectors on the premise that moving \nthe power sector toward financial sustainability will increase the ability of state governments to \nallocate resources for poverty reduction.  \n \n29.  In 2002\u20132003, ADB conducted project performance audits of energy projects in India,22 \nwhich identified the following lessons: (i) land acquisition should be carried out expeditiously to \nminimize  implementation  delays;  (ii)  construction  contracts  should  be  properly  packaged \n(including  fewer  and  larger  contracts)  to  simplify  procurement  and  facilitate  project \nimplementation; and (iii) loan covenants should be appropriate, as loan covenants in a particular \ninvestment project lack the impact to change overall government policies. Furthermore, an \nearlier performance audit of a thermal power project in India23 contained key findings including \n(i) ADB\u2019s energy policy to promote cleaner energy sources and reduce reliance on coal-fired \ngenerating  capacity  is  reconfirmed,  given  overall  environmental  and  cost  implications;  and \n(ii) sector restructuring should be implemented gradually rather than attempting quick reform \nthrough project covenants. \n \n30.  A sector assistance program evaluation24 was conducted in 2007 on the energy sector in \nIndia, which identifies lessons and areas where the Government, ADB, the private sector, and \nother stakeholders can work together in achieving sector development goals more effectively. \nThe main lessons identified are: (i) ADB\u2019s approach to lending at the state level has worked well \nand should be used as a model for future assistance; (ii) sustained technical assistance is \nneeded to support state level reform programs; and (iii) corporatization is providing benefits \nsimilar to those normally attributed to privatization, as the introduction of commercially and \nfinancially sustainable principles into state entities can considerably improve efficiency and \ndeliver better services to customers. \n \n31.  These experiences are reflected in the design and preparation of the proposed MFF, \nincluding  corporatizing  the  state  hydropower  generating  company,  HPPCL,  and  providing \nsupport at the state level for reforms and capacity development. Lessons have also been \nincorporated  into  subproject  selection  and  preparing  procurement  packages,  which  are \nconsistent with the project readiness criteria agreed between India and ADB.25 Details on the \nproject readiness for the first tranche of the proposed MFF are in Appendix 5. \n \n                                                 \n22  ADB. 2002.

The  power  sector  in  India  has  received  assistance  from  various  international \ndevelopment partners (Appendix 4). Japan Bank for International Cooperation and the World \nBank have been the major source of external funding to the sector, focusing on reforms in \ngeneration,  facility  rehabilitation  and  improvement,  and  development  of  renewable  energy \nresources.26 Further,  German  development  cooperation  through  KfW  is  also  assisting  the \nsector.  The  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  and  the  Department  for \nInternational  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom  are  also  present  in  the  sector  through \ntechnical assistance support.  \n \n8.  Policy Dialogue \n33.  Regulatory System. The Electricity Act came into force on 9 June 2003. Himachal \nPradesh already had an established, functioning regulatory commission as of 2001, and has \nbeen issuing tariff orders since then. Annually, HPSEB and other licensees (e.g., certain IPPs) \nare  required  to  petition  HPERC  for  tariffs,  and  after  consideration  of  stakeholders\u2019  inputs, \nHPERC  rules  on  tariff  applications.  The  resulting  tariff  orders  are  the  key  instrument  of \nregulation and sector governance. Licensees are allowed to appeal the tariff orders, which may \neventually be resolved by court rulings. \n \n34.  HPERC holds regular review meetings to monitor compliance with the various directives, \nand in its tariff order for FY2006, it made efforts to reduce cross-subsidies and to optimize \npower purchase costs by mandating the procurement of power on a merit order dispatch basis. \nHPERC has also taken steps toward complying with the provisions of the Electricity Act, 2003, \nfrom  a  regulatory  perspective,  including  issuing  and  monitoring  performance  standards  for \nHPSEB,  constituting  a  forum  for  addressing  consumer  grievances,  and  appointing  an \nombudsman. In June 2005, HPERC issued open access regulations.  \n \n35.  Sector Restructuring. HPSEB currently owns very little generation (476 MW total). As \nHPPCL is to own and operate all planned state sector hydropower development, it will become \nthe state\u2019s generating company. The corporatization of HPPCL effectively unbundles generation \nfrom HPSEB\u2019s predominantly transmission and distribution operations, and an eventual transfer \nof HPSEB\u2019s few generating assets to HPPCL is envisioned. Further to the process of HPSEB\u2019s \nrestructuring, HPSEB has drawn up a proposal for its unbundling. The first step is to unbundle \nthe distinct operations internally and account for them separately. In its FY2007 and FY2008 \ntariff  filings,  HPSEB  unbundled  its  costs  into  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution \nelements; and adopted an approach toward unbundling, identifying, and isolating its assets, \ncosts, and revenues.  \n \nIII.  INVESTMENT PROPOSAL  \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n36.  The impact of the ADB-supported subset of the state\u2019s investment plan, the Himachal \nPradesh Clean Energy Development Investment Program (the Program), will be a sustainable \nelectricity sector in Himachal Pradesh and improved state finances. \n \n                                                 \n26 There is a World Bank-funded project (412 MW Rampur Hydropower Project) located within Himachal Pradesh. It \nis a central government sector project with GOHP as a 30% minority shareholder. \n ", "10   \n37.  The outcome of the Program will be increased clean energy production through run-of-\nriver hydropower schemes, as well as improved planning, implementation, management and \npower sector governance.   \n \nB.  Outputs \n38.  The Program will provide financing for two major areas of investment: \n \n(i)  Hydropower capacity additions. Construction of physical infrastructure built for \nhydropower  generation,  including  underground  powerhouses,  associated  civil \nworks,  tunnels,  river  diversion,  and  power  evacuation  systems.  Specific \nsubprojects have been earmarked for the first and second tranches and include \nthe Sawra Kuddu Hydroelectric Project (111 MW) and the Kashang I, II and III \nHydroelectric  Projects  (195  MW).  Subprojects  identified  for  future  projects \ninclude the Sainj (100 MW) and Shongtong-Karcham (402 MW) hydroelectric \nprojects, although others from the state\u2019s investment plan may be substituted in \nfuture tranches provided they meet the eligibility criteria. All hydropower projects \nproposed for the Program will be run-of-river design. \n \n(ii)  Capacity development. This activity will focus on addressing constraints at the \nImplementing Agency (IA) levels, wherein $12 million has been earmarked for \ncapacity development components. For the principal IA (HPPCL), the capacity \ndevelopment is designed to address weaknesses identified by the procurement \ncapacity and the financial management assessment as well as the training of \nHPPCL staff to be able to manage its growing asset size. The main focus of the \nproject preparation, implementation, and management subcomponent will help \nthe  IA  (a)  prepare  future  projects;  (b) implement  and  administer  approved \nprojects; and (c) monitor, review, evaluate, and report on program and project \nimplementation.  This  subcomponent  will  also  include  project  planning, \nconstruction  supervision,  contract  management,  procurement,  disbursements, \nsafeguards  compliance,  and  monitoring  and  reporting  systems.  Financial \nmanagement and accountability is a second major subcomponent designed to \nimprove accounting and auditing systems, while incorporating adequate financial \nmanagement standards to ensure fiduciary oversight of disbursed funds. A third \nsubcomponent  will  address  HPPCL\u2019s  training  needs  in  state-of-the-art \ntechnologies,  management,  and  development  of  in-house  capacity  in  CDM \nprocedures.  The  total  capacity  building  subcomponents  under  tranche  1 \nbenefiting HPPCL will be $9 million. The remaining $3 million will be used under \ntranche 1 for the benefit of the state\u2019s transmission utility, HPSEB. The new \ngeneration capacity to be added in the state will increase responsibilities in the \nareas of transmission and distribution for HPSEB. It was agreed to assist HPSEB \nin  acquiring  an  enterprise  resource  planning  solution  to  cover  all  its  future \ncomputer accounting and management information system (MIS) applications \nand to finance the purchase of software, hardware, training, and initial system \nmaintenance. The capacity development and action plan is in Appendix 6. \n \nC.  Technical Justification and Eligibility Criteria \n39.  The long-term generation expansion program for Himachal Pradesh has been designed \nbased on national, regional, and state-level least-cost expansion planning led by the Ministry of \nPower,  Central  Electricity  Authority,  and  GOHP.  The  expansion  program  is  technically, \n ", "  11\nfinancially, and economically viable; and can be implemented with minimal environmental and \nsocial impact. Best practice design standards and construction techniques will be applied to all \ninvestments.  Technical  details  on  the  hydropower  projects  of  the  proposed  Program  are \navailable in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \n40.  The following criteria will apply for selecting and approving subprojects intended for \nfinancing under the MFF: \n \n(i)  the subproject will be consistent with the state\u2019s hydropower policy and forms \npart of the state\u2019s investment program; \n(ii)  the subproject was designed on a least-cost basis; and reflects \u201cbest practice\u201d \ndesign, construction, and operations and maintenance features;  \n(iii)  the subproject displays performance-based design consistent with international \nbenchmarks for system efficiency and operational risks;  \n(iv)  the subproject will be economically viable and financially sustainable; \n(v)  the subproject was prepared and designed in compliance with the FFA (including \nADB\u2019s Social Dimensions and Safeguard Requirements set forth in the FFA);  \n(vi)  the subproject is ready to absorb the requested financing; \n(vii)  a land acquisition and resettlement plan that meets the requirements of ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (2005) and the resettlement framework referred \nto in the FFA, as amended or updated from time to time, has been prepared for \nthe subproject and submitted to ADB for review, as necessary; \n(viii)  an indigenous peoples development plan (IPDP) that meets the requirements of \nADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998)  and  the  indigenous  peoples \ndevelopment framework (IPDF) referred to in the FFA has been prepared for the \nsubproject and submitted to ADB for review; \n(ix)  an  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  or  an  initial  environmental \nexamination (IEE) (as the case may be) and an environmental management and \nmonitoring plan that meets the requirements of ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) \nand the Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (EARF) referred to \nin the FFA, as amended or updated from time to time, have been prepared for \nthe subproject and submitted to ADB for review; \n(x)  summary  environmental  impact  assessment  (SEIA)  and  summary  initial \nenvironmental examinations (SIEE) for environment category A and B-sensitive \nsubprojects, respectively, have been prepared and reviewed by ADB as required \nand made available to the public 120 days before a periodic financing request \n(PFR) is submitted to ADB; \n(xi)  a poverty and social assessment will be conducted for the subproject and results \nhave been presented in ADB\u2019s summary poverty reduction and social strategy \nformat; \n(xii)  sufficient  counterpart  funding  has  been  allocated  by  India  and/or  GOHP  as \nrequired to implement the subproject as scheduled and maintain the subproject \nin accordance with the requirements of the FFA; and \n(xiii)  all necessary national and state government approvals have been obtained for \nthe subproject. \n \n \n ", "12   \nD.  Special Features \n \n41.  Climate  Change  Mitigation  and  Carbon  Emissions  Trading.  The  hydropower \ninvestments are candidates for earning revenue from selling emissions reductions under the \nCDM.27 Based on power generation potential of about 3,102 GWh per year, and as these \nprojects are located in the northern regional grid considering an emission factor of 750 tons per \nGWh,28 these projects collectively have the potential to generate up to 2.3 million emission \nreductions per year, or 2.3 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO ) equivalent. However, a detailed \n2\nassessment is required with respect to additionality issues and other requirements of the Kyoto \nProtocol before these projects are taken up for CDM development. In addition, most of these \nprojects are likely to be commissioned in 2012 or beyond, so non-CDM markets that could offer \ncarbon credit revenue opportunities should also be investigated. When taking into account all \nprojects within the state in various stages of planning, there is a potential to avoid up to \n21.8 million tons of CO  equivalent per annum (footnote 28). ADB provided a CDM specialist \n2\nduring project preparation to assess carbon market potential for the proposed projects as well \nas the state as a whole, which resulted in a detailed presentation attended by state government \nofficials representing many sectors. At HPPCL\u2019s request, ADB has also provided terms for CDM \nfinancing  through  ADB\u2019s  Asia  Pacific  Carbon  Fund  and  Future  Carbon  Fund.  HPPCL  is \nexploring  various  options  including  evaluating  the  fund\u2019s  products.  Follow-up  missions  will \ninclude a presentation on the Future Carbon Fund and its services and benefits. \n \n42.  Private Sector Participation. The state\u2019s hydropower policy recognizes the importance \nof private investment in fully harnessing the state\u2019s hydropower resources. There are currently \nabout 386 MW of privately-owned hydropower projects operating in Himachal Pradesh, with \nadditional  2,238  MW  (including  750  MW  of mini-hydropower)  earmarked  for  private  sector \ndevelopment  during  the  11th  FYP.  Given  the  huge  capital  needs  of  the  state\u2019s  overall \ninvestment program, HPPCL is exploring various types of PPP. In April 2008, HPPCL\u2019s board \napproved a plan to develop a 500 MW hydropower facility jointly with the private sector, as well \nas 10 MW of solar projects within the state. In addition, another standby project29 in the state\u2019s \ninvestment plan may be considered for adopting a PPP arrangement. ADB has discussed PPP \nwith HPPCL, HPERC, Infrastructure Development Board, and various other state government \nrepresentatives. At the request of GOHP, the capacity development component of the proposed \nMFF will include knowledge transfer of the applicable structures and modalities, mechanics, and \ndocumentation requirements for HPPCL to enter into PPPs in hydropower projects. In addition, \nHPPCL is a candidate for assistance through a proposed ADB technical assistance designed to \nprepare and market actual PPP projects throughout India.30 \n \n43.  Capacity Development. Other than supporting HPPCL\u2019s capacity development needs \nin project management, construction supervision, and ongoing project management, additional \nassistance  will  include  improved  governance  and  financial  management  to  support  its \ncorporatization as the state\u2019s stand-alone power generating company. As HPPCL intends to \nenter into joint ventures with the private sector to develop and construct 10 MW of solar power \nprojects  and  a  500  MW  hydropower  project  in  the  state  by  forming  a  PPP,  HPPCL  has \nrequested assistance on knowledge transfer of various aspects of PPP. The MFF will also \n                                                 \n27 A criteria for CDM eligibility is \u201cadditionality\u201d, and refers to whether a project is \u201cadditional\u201d and is not the business-\nas-usual scenario (e.g., if the project is less profitable than either a benchmark or nonrenewable alternatives, or \notherwise faces other barriers). \n28 ADB estimate. \n29  Chirgaon Majhgaon Hydroelectric Project (46 MW). \n30 ADB.

In addition to assisting HPPCL, the capacity \ndevelopment component will include assistance to the state\u2019s transmission utility, HPSEB.  The \ncapacity development subcomponent within the Program totaling $3 million will assist HPSEB in \nacquiring an enterprise resource planning solution to cover all its future computer accounting \nand  management  information  systems  applications  to  ensure  HPSEB  is  able  to  properly \nmanage and report on its operational activities. Also, as upgrading transmission capacity will be \nrequired as hydropower generating capacity is added in the state, ADB is considering assisting \nHPSEB with its transmission system master plan separately from this MFF (with technical \nassistance preparation in progress).  \n \nE.  Investment Program and Financing Plan \n44.  The  state\u2019s  overall  hydropower  development  plan  aims  to  achieve  4,021.5  MW  of \ninstalled hydropower capacity31 by the end of the 11th Five Year Plan in 2012 (Table 1).  \n \nTable 1: Hydropower Development for the 11th Five Year Plan \nInstalled   Estimated Cost \nSector  Capacity (MW)    ($ million) \nState Sector       290.5 a    493 \nCentral Government  2,243.0  3,813 \nand/or Joint Sector b   \nPrivate Sector  1,488.0    2,462 \n      Total    4,021.5    6,768 \nMW = megawatt. \na This figure reflects projects commissioned during the 11th Five Year Plan only. \n632 MW of the 808 total MW intended to be funded under the Investment Program \nare scheduled for commissioning post 2012. \nb This includes projects developed either by Central Government power sector \nentities alone or jointly with either state or private sector entities. \nSource: Government of Himachal Pradesh. Estimated costs are based on general $ \nper kilowatt cost assumptions. \n \nOther than the selected projects to be financed by ADB, financing for the state sector\u2019s portion \nof this generation plan is intended to come from other financial institutions in the form of loans. \nThe private sector project financing will be privately arranged.  \n                     \n45.  The  Program\u2019s  selected  projects  will  come  from  the  state\u2019s  portion  of  the  overall \nhydropower development plan and are expected to total about 808 MW. The estimated cost of \nthese selected projects is about $1.5 billion. The Government has requested financing up to the \nequivalent of $800 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, and both the Government and \nGOHP have asked ADB to extend this financing in the form of an MFF. GOHP will finance \n$450 million (30%) and the remaining $250 million (16.7%) will be financed from other Indian \nfinancial  institutions,  with  potential  lenders  being  Power  Finance  Corporation32 and  Rural \nElectrification Corporation, or through other cofinancing efforts.

As hydropower is vital to India, and Himachal \nPradesh has the hydro resources to become the country\u2019s hydropower state, continuous ADB \nengagement over multiple subprojects, including nonphysical investments in capacity building, \nwill maximize the financial as well as knowledge-based resources that ADB can offer GOHP as \na  client.  An  MFF  provides  up-front  support  to  GOHP  for  its  substantial  clean  energy \ndevelopment program, but with financial commitments sequenced to match project readiness. \nAs the sequenced investments are all run-of-river hydropower projects, expertise will build over \ntime, allowing future subprojects to benefit directly from the implementation experience gained \nfrom the initial investments and from the capacity development component, which is expected to \ncarry on for a significant portion of the Program.  \n \n47.  The MFF will extend multiple loans to finance a range of projects under the Investment \nProgram, subject to the submission of a related PFR by the Government and execution of the \nrelated  loan  and  project  agreements.  Each  PFR  will  be  accompanied  by  a  detailed  cost \nestimate, as well as an implementation schedule. The Government is required to comply with \nthe  FFA  requirements.  The  loans  under  the  MFF  will  finance  civil  works,  equipment, \nconstruction, consulting services, and capacity building activities. The minimum amount of a \nPFR will be $40 million.  \n \n48.  All provisions of the ordinary operations loan regulations applicable to London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based loans34 will apply to each loan, subject to any modifications that \nmight  be  included  under  any  loan  agreement.  The  Government  can  choose  from  eligible \ncurrencies and interest rate regimes for each loan. The specific terms of each loan will be based \non the related PFR, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decisions to \nborrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices \nwere its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice \nfrom ADB. \n \n49.  If the Government requests any cofinancing arrangements or related assistance for \nprojects  under  the  MFF,  ADB  may  assist  with  these,  subject  to  related  ADB  policy  and \n                                                 \n33 ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n ", "  15\nprocedures. Furthermore, it is possible that ADB will seek a component of grant funding from \nthe Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility35 for a portion of one of the loans. \n \n50.  The Government will provide the proceeds of each tranche to GOHP and will cause the \nproceeds to be applied to the financing of expenditures on the subprojects and the capacity \ndevelopment component in accordance with the conditions set forth in the FFA and the legal \nagreements for each tranche. GOHP will onlend funds to HPPCL under arm\u2019s-length terms to \nensure commercial discipline. \n \n51.  The MFF transaction is accompanied by the tranche 1 PFR to finance two subprojects \nconsisting  of  hydropower  generation  facilities,  which  are  ready  for  implementation,  plus  a \ncapacity development component.36 The total cost of the first tranche subprojects and capacity \ndevelopment amounts to $224.8 million. HPPCL requested ADB to provide $150 million as a \nfirst tranche loan. The amount of $150 million is a firm loan amount in ADB\u2019s 2008 assistance \npipeline for India. The detailed cost estimates of the first tranche loan are given in Appendix 7. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Executing and Implementing Agency \n52.  The Multipurpose Projects (MPP) and Power Department of GOHP is the EA with overall \nresponsibility for execution of the Investment Program and subprojects. HPPCL was established \nby the state government, and it is mandated to develop and operate new hydropower plants in \nthe state. HPPCL will function as the IA for the proposed MFF with responsibility for the day-to-\nday  coordination,  implementation,  and  administration  of  the  investment  subprojects  and \ncapacity development components for which HPPCL is the recipient. Each of the hydropower \nprojects will have a separate field office to facilitate its smooth functioning. They will function as \nPMUs at the field level, performing project site-specific monitoring, construction supervision, and \nreporting. There will be a central PMU within HPPCL\u2019s head office covering the overall MFF and \nperforming  centralized  financial  reporting  management  functions.  As  a  $3  million  capacity \ndevelopment  subcomponent  is  earmarked  for  HPSEB,  it  will  be  the  IA  for  that  particular \nsubcomponent. The MFF implementation structure chart is in Appendix 8. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n53.  The Program will be implemented over 8 years, including procurement and construction \nactivities. Each specific loan will have its own closing date to match the implementation period \nof the subproject(s) funded under that loan. The first PFR for an amount of $150 million was \nsigned  on  11  September  2008.  The  indicative  implementation  schedule  for  the  appraised \nsubprojects is in Appendix 9 and an indicative schedule for the overall MFF is in Appendix 10. \n \n3.  Program Management \n54.  HPPCL will appraise additional subprojects following approval of the MFF. HPPCL will \nalso  undertake  detailed  design,  procurement,  construction  supervision,  commissioning, \n                                                 \n35 The Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility was launched in April 2007 as an innovative mechanism to pool \nvarious forms of additional development assistance funds for clean energy under one roof. It is a multidonor fund \nwhich supports grant components of investment projects and technical assistance. \n36 This consists of the 111 MW Sawra Kuddu Hydroelectric Project, the civil works for the 65 MW Kashang I \nHydroelectric Project (including the common power house for the Kashang I, II and III Projects totaling 195 MW), \nand a $12 million capacity development component.  \n ", "16   \nmaintenance,  and  operation  of  the  subprojects.  Technical  support  from  consultants  and \ncontractors  will  be  employed  as  necessary  with  funding  from  the  capacity  development \ncomponent budget. HPPCL will liaise with ADB on a regular basis. \n \n55.  The PMU will be responsible for processing and implementing the subprojects. It will be \nassisted  by  technical  experts  who  will  evaluate  the  technical  reports,  feasibility  studies, \npreliminary design reports, environmental assessment reports, resettlement and indigenous \npeoples development plans, and detailed design reports to ensure compliance with ADB and \ngovernment requirements. Summary appraisal reports will be submitted to ADB subsequent to \nGOHP approval and required government clearances.  \n \n4.  Performance Monitoring, Evaluation and Progress Reporting \n56.  The  PMU  will  prepare  quarterly  progress  reports  and  submit  these  to  ADB  within \n30 days of the end of each quarter. These reports will provide (i) a narrative description of \nprogress made during the period; (ii) changes in the implementation schedule; (iii) problems or \ndifficulties  encountered;  (iv)  work  to  be  carried  out  in  the  next  period;  (v)  progress  on \nenvironmental  and  social  compliance;  (vi)  for  all  environment  category  A  projects  and  all \nenvironmentally sensitive category B projects, a report on implementation of EMPs; and (vi) \ncompliance with conditions of the individual loan and project agreements. The progress reports \nwill also include a summary financial account for the project components, including subprojects, \nconsisting of project expenditures during the period, total expenditures to date, and benefit \nmonitoring in accordance with procedures and details acceptable to ADB. Performance will be \nevaluated  on  the  basis  of  indicators  and  targets  stipulated  in  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework.  The  ADB  project  team  will  prepare  periodic  reports  to  inform  ADB\u2019s  Board  of \nDirectors  of  overall  progress.  A  Board  information  report  will  be  submitted  annually,  and \nsupplemental progress reports will be submitted prior to management approval of individual loan \nagreements. \n \n5.  Review \n57.  ADB will field an inception mission within 3 months of the first loan approval. ADB will \nreview the implementation and operations based on the quarterly progress reports and meet \nwith HPPCL and GOHP semiannually to discuss implementation progress. A midterm review to \nbe carried out 2 years after loan effectiveness will focus on engineering, resettlement, and \nenvironmental aspects of the ADB-supported investments and review the financial status of \nHPPCL. Representatives of ADB, GOHP, and HPPCL will take part in the review. The review \nwill allow for any necessary midcourse corrections to ensure successful implementation and \nachievement of objectives. For all environment category A subprojects and all environmentally \nsensitive category B projects, review missions from ADB regional departments will conduct an \nannual review of environmental aspects of the subproject. A project completion report will be \nsubmitted within 3 months following completion of the individual loans. A facility completion \nreport will be prepared after the completion of all ADB-supported activities and subprojects. \n \n6.  Stakeholder Participation and Consultation \n58.  The project development agencies, in particular HPPCL, have been consulting with \nstakeholders including affected communities during the design stage. During the preparatory \nstages of the first tranche projects, consultations have been carried out with various government \nofficials concerned. Local communities were consulted as part of the social and resettlement \nstudy to gather their views on the proposed Program. All the affected persons are also being \n ", "  17\nconsulted  on  a  one-to-one  basis  through  questionnaire  surveys.  Additionally,  focus  group \ndiscussions are in progress within the project influence areas. Consultations will continue during \nthe  entire  project  cycle  according  to  a  stakeholder  participation  plan.  As  there  will  be \npreparatory work for second and/or third tranche projects during first tranche implementation, \nstakeholder participation and public consultation will continue as initiated in the first tranche \nprocessing. \n \n7.  Procurement \n59.  Goods, equipment, and civil works to be financed under the MFF will be procured in \naccordance  with  ADB  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nInternational  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  will  be  used  for  civil  works  and  turnkey  contracts \ntargeting the construction of hydropower plants. National competitive bidding (NCB) will be used \nfor contracts for goods and equipment estimated to cost less than $1.0 million. Goods and \nworks  less  than  $100,000  will  be  procured  following  shopping  procedures.  Before \ncommencement of NCB procurement, ADB and the Government will review the procurement \nprocedures related to the project component to be funded by ADB to ensure consistency with \nADB requirements. Any necessary modifications or clarifications will be documented in the \nprocurement plan. Contract packages will be prepared and structured to ensure maximum \ncompetition.  Similar  contractual  arrangements  and  specifications  will  be  applied  to  other \nsubprojects. In accordance with these arrangements, a procurement plan for the subprojects \nunder the tranche 1 loan is in Appendix 11. \n \n8.  Consulting Services \n60.  Consulting services are required to provide support to HPPCL for project implementation \nwork, including design, supervision of construction, management for the subprojects under the \napproved MFF loans, and for processing work and PFR preparation for future loans. Consulting \nservices will also be provided for evaluation, monitoring, and reporting purposes. In addition, \nconsultants will support the capacity building component under the MFF. Consultants will be \nselected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, \nas amended from time to time). Consulting firms will be selected using the quality- and cost-\nbased selection method and full technical proposal. Individual experts may also be recruited \nbased on biodata submitted in response to specific terms of reference for assignments.  \n   \n9.  Disbursement Arrangements \n61.  The proceeds of individual loans under the MFF will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). Subject to ADB \ncontroller\u2019s concurrence, ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures will be used to reimburse eligible \nexpenditures, which will be applicable to individual payments of $100,000 or less. \n   \n10.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n62.  To expedite implementation, the Government and GOHP has requested ADB\u2019s approval \nto  carry  out  advance  actions  for  procurement  of  works  and  goods,  and  recruitment  of \nconsultants. This advance procurement action is intended to be used in all tranches of the MFF. \nThe Government and GOHP have also requested retroactive financing arrangements to apply to \nthe MFF to cover incurred project expenses in accordance with ADB\u2019s procedures. ADB granted \napproval of advance contracting, and approval for retroactive financing on 10 March 2008. The \nGovernment, the EA and the IA have been informed that approval of advance actions does not \n ", "18   \ncommit ADB to approve any of the individual tranches or to finance the procurement costs. \nExcept as otherwise agreed with ADB, the expenditures incurred for equipment, civil works, and \nconsulting services will be eligible for retroactive financing, provided that these are incurred \nbefore the effectiveness of the related loan agreement, but not earlier than 12 months preceding \nthe signing of the related loan agreement, and as long as they do not exceed an amount of 20% \nof the individual loan. Each PFR will specify the nature of expenditure if retroactive financing is \nrequired.  The  Government  and  the  EA  have  been  informed  that  ADB  will  not  finance \nexpenditures incurred prior to effectiveness of individual tranches, even if advance contracting \nwas approved, unless retroactive financing has also been approved. \n  \n11.  Accounting, Auditing, and Financial Reporting \n63.  HPPCL  shall  maintain  separate  accounts  for  each  subproject  and  for  its  overall \noperations. HPPCL shall have such accounts and related financial statements (balance sheet, \nstatement of income and expenses, and related statements) audited annually, in accordance \nwith  appropriate  auditing  standards  consistently  applied,  by  independent  auditors  whose \nqualifications, experience and terms of reference are acceptable to ADB. HPPCL shall furnish to \nADB certified copies of such audited accounts and financial statements and the relating report \nof the auditors no later than 9 months after the close of the fiscal year. This shall include the \nauditors' opinion on the use of loan proceeds and compliance with the covenants of the legal \nagreement(s) as well as on the use of the procedures for statement of expenditures. HPPCL \nshall furnish to ADB such further information concerning such accounts, financial statements \nand the audit as ADB shall from time to time reasonably request. \n \n12.  Anticorruption Policy \n64.  Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB reserves the right to review and examine, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to subprojects and components \nunder the Investment Program. In this regard, investigation of government officials, if any, would \nbe requested by ADB to be undertaken by the Government. To support these efforts, relevant \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) are included in the loan \nregulations (footnote 34) and the bidding documents for the MFF. In particular, all contracts \nfinanced by ADB in connection with the MFF shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB \nto  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  HPPCL  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the subprojects and components \nunder the Investment Program. \n \n13.  Governance Measures \n65.   ADB\u2019s  intervention  will  support  the  corporatization  of  HPPCL  into  an  efficient, \ncommercially  oriented  generation  company.  ADB\u2019s  capacity  development  component  will \nsupport organizational and governance efforts; and will enhance HPPCL\u2019s capacity to manage \nboth the physical and financial construction activities, and provide management and financial \nreporting  to  meet  both  GOHP  and  ADB  accounting,  asset  management,  and  reporting \nrequirements.  On  managing  physical  construction  activities,  use  of  ADB  guidelines  on \nprocurement  and  consulting  services  and  standard  bidding  documents  will  provide  an \nopportunity  for  better  monitoring.  Bid  specifications  and  packaging  will  ensure  maximum \ncompetition. On managing financial activities, recruitment of additional financial management \nexperts and the enhancement of internal control systems, supported with advanced information \nand communication technology-based financial management systems, will ensure efficiency and \n ", "  19\naccountability.  External  auditors  will  audit  the  financial  statements.  Measurable  financial \nperformance indicators are being set and will be evaluated by HPERC. ADB review missions \nwill review HPPCL\u2019s accounting and control systems to monitor expenditures and other financial \ntransactions, and ensure safe custody of project-financed assets.

PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Economic and Financial Justification \n \n1.  Financial Management \n \n66.  A financial management assessment of the IA (HPPCL) was undertaken to assess its \nability to undertake and fulfill ADB\u2019s fiduciary requirements for the project components. The \nassessment was in accordance with ADB\u2019s Financial Management and Analysis of Projects 37 \nusing  the  financial  management  assessment  questionnaire  and  field  interviews.  HPPCL \nincludes the merged operations of Pabber Valley Power Corporation (PVPC) and Kinner Kailash \nPower Corporation (KKPC), two companies established as special purpose vehicles to construct \nthe Sawra Kuddu and Kashang projects. HPPCL\u2019s first financial statements were prepared for \nthe financial year ending 31 March 2007, and following the merger of the three companies as of \n                                                 \n37 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "20   \n1 August 2007, the accounts as of 31 March 2008 will incorporate the assets of PVPC and \nKKPC.  At  present,  PVPC  and  KKPC  are  construction  companies,  with  annual  accounts \nrecording works in progress and financing sources, with all staff costs and other operating costs \ncapitalized. Revenues will not be generated from hydropower projects until the beginning of \nFY2013. The existing accounting systems of PVPC and KKPC are manual accrual systems, \nbased on HPSEB ledger and accounting codes. Accounting staff employed by these special \npurpose vehicles at both the project site offices and head office will transfer to HPPCL. \n \n67.  The  capacity  development  component  of  the  proposed  MFF  (part  of  tranche  1)  is \ndesigned to address weaknesses identified by the financial management assessment, and will \ndevelop a computerized accounting system and MIS that will meet HPPCL\u2019s accounting and \nfinancial  reporting  requirements  as  well  as  the  project  level  accounting  and  reporting \nrequirements under the MFF. Staff will be trained in the new computerized accounting systems; \ncorporate  accounting  procedures;  and  in  all  appropriate  accounting,  reporting,  and  audit \nfunctions. HPPCL may also obtain support from chartered accounting firms for internal audit \nfunction  until  staff  has  been  properly  trained.  As  a  consequence  of  existing  support  from \nHPPCL\u2019s parent, HPSEB, and the proposed upgrading and computerisation of accounting and \nMIS  systems  and  recommended  training,  the  proposed  project  financial  management \narrangements are considered satisfactory. \n \n2.  Financial Sustainability\u2014Past Performance and Future Projections \n \n68.  To assess the sector\u2019s past financial sustainability, the financial performance of HPSEB \nwas examined. While HPSEB generated losses over FY2003\u2013FY2005, it achieved net profits in \nFY2006 and FY2007. HPSEB\u2019s increased revenues and improved profit performance have \nresulted from an increase in electricity sales to consumers as well as an increase in power sales \noutside the state. Another factor was an increase in tariffs, though revenue increases from \nhigher tariffs were partially offset by a sharp increase in power purchase costs. HPSEB has also \nimproved  operationally  by  reducing  its  system  losses  from  24.8%  in  FY2003  to  16.3%  in \nFY2007. However, HPSEB\u2019s net profit and internally generated cash has not been sufficient to \nmeet  its  debt  service.  It  has  nevertheless  met  its  debt  obligations  by  utilizing  long-term \nborrowings (timing difference between drawdowns and capital expenditures), increasing short-\nterm borrowings, and by extending payment periods to its creditors. HPSEB\u2019s balance sheet is \nrelatively  strong,  with  a  favorable  debt\u2013equity  ratio.  Accounts  receivable  are  creditable  at \n1.4 months of electricity sales revenue in FY2007, indicating that most customers pay within \n15 days of receiving their bill. This is a considerable improvement, compared with 4.1 months of \nreceivables in FY2003. The details are in Supplementary Appendixes C and D. \n \n69.  Going forward, to ensure sound financial performance, HPPCL should maintain a debt \nservice  coverage  ratio  of  1.2.  GOHP  and  HPPCL  will  ensure  this  sustainable  target  is \nmaintained, even in the event of transfer of HPSEB\u2019s generation functions. Financial projections \nprepared for HPPCL demonstrate that a debt service coverage ratio of 1.4 in FY2013 and 1.3 or \ngreater is maintained through FY2020. The impact of the transfer of HPSEB\u2019s hydro assets and \nliabilities to HPPCL was also examined. The transfer would result in a positive contribution to \nHPPCL\u2019s financial performance. HPPCL\u2019s projected cash on hand in FY2020 is Rs7.1 billion \n($178  million)  when  including  HPSEB  hydropower  generation  operations,  compared  with \nRs2.1 billion ($53 million) without HPSEB\u2019s operations. \n \n \n \n \n ", "  21\n3.  Financial Analysis \n \n70.  Separate financial analysis for each subproject and tranche of the proposed MFF will be \ncarried out. A financial evaluation of the tranche 1 projects, Sawra Kuddu and Kashang I \n(including Kashang II and III to be financed in tranche 2 as they are an integrated project), was \ncarried out in 2008 prices. The project cost estimates and financial projections were converted \ninto real terms by adjusting for the projected effects of domestic inflation. Project revenues are \nbased on the methodology applied by the regulator (HPERC) based on the 2004 CERC tariff \nregulations. The base case financial internal rates of return (FIRRs) for each project are 7.0% \nfor Sawra Kuddu and 6.7% for Kashang I, II and III, compared with the average weighted \naverage cost of capital (WACC) of 3.6%, thus indicating financial viability. Sensitivity analyses \nshowed that the results were robust to a range of project-related sensitivities. The value of \ncarbon credits was not included, as there is uncertainty surrounding the value of such credits \nbeyond the current 2012 expiration of the Kyoto Protocol. It is expected, however, that such \ncredits will further enhance the Program\u2019s viability, and the availability of credits has been taken \ninto account by HPPCL in its investment analysis. A summary of the financial analysis is in \nAppendix 12.  \n \n4.  Economic Analysis \n \n71.  Economic analysis was undertaken for the subprojects to be financed under the first \ntranche  of  the  MFF.  The  economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs)  were  calculated  by \ncomparing  with-  and  without-project  scenarios.  Economic  benefits  accrue  to  consumers  in \nHimachal Pradesh, the national grid, and the overall economy. Incremental consumption occurs \nbecause of the extended availability of electricity during peak demand periods. This was valued \nusing  consumers\u2019  willingness  to  pay  for  this  incremental  consumption.  Non-incremental \nconsumption occurs as other forms of energy are displaced by electricity from the project (the \nresource  cost  saving).  This  was  valued  on  the  basis  of  the  estimated  marginal  cost  of \ngeneration from the grid. Although only the civil works of the Kashang I project, including the \ncommon power hours for the Kashang I, II and III projects, is included in tranche 1, certain costs \nfor the Kashang II and III projects (tranche 2) are incurred during the construction of the first \nstage. For this reason, economic analysis for the integrated Kashang I, II and III projects were \nundertaken rather than just for the first stage as a stand-alone project. Sensitivity to the effects \nof deferral and cancellation of the subsequent stages of the Kashang project was tested. \n \n72.  Initial estimates indicate that Sawra Kuddu has an EIRR of 20.7% and Kashang I, II and \nIII  has  an  EIRR  of  17.8%.  This  shows  the  economic  viability  of  both  subprojects.  Both \nsubprojects demonstrate robust economic performance under a range of downside sensitivity \ntests. A summary of the economic analysis is in Appendix 13, with further detail available in \nSupplementary Appendix B. \n \nB.  Social Aspects \n \n73.  Land acquisition will be significant for the Sawra Kuddu subproject but it will not be \nsignificant for Kashang I, II and III. In both cases, the design is based on run-of-river schemes in \nremote and scarcely populated areas. Impacts will therefore be limited. Extensive discussions \nwith  HPPCL  officials  have  occurred  on  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples. \nHPPCL has been made aware of the documentation that addresses social and resettlement \nissues and indigenous peoples that will be required for each tranche. The importance of proper \nimplementation of safeguards mitigation measures during the project construction and operation \nstages was also emphasized. \n ", "22   \n \n74.  Land for the Sawra Kuddu and Kashang I, II and III subprojects38 has been identified; \nand acquisition procedures have been initiated following the Land Acquisition Act, and the \nnational policy on resettlement and rehabilitation.39 Additional land will be required for widening \nthe access roads for Kashang I, II and III. A resettlement and rehabilitation plan was prepared in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), Operations Manual section on \ninvoluntary resettlement,40 and government policies to meet ADB standards and requirements. \nHPPCL assured that it will comply with all domestic laws and ADB policies, and has prepared \nrequisite plans where applicable, including the resettlement framework, which was completed in \nJanuary 2008 for the overall Program and keeps in view the relevant policies endorsed by \nGOHP.41 Social screening has been done for the tranche 1 subprojects. It is observed that \ninvoluntary resettlement will be minimized. A census survey of all affected persons was carried \nout along with their socioeconomic details. Based on the assessment, two resettlement plans, \none for each project, were prepared and submitted to ADB. A total of 195 households will be \naffected, of which 193 on a permanent basis. A total of 49.42 hectares of land will also be \naffected. \n \n75.  As Himachal Pradesh contains tribal areas and therefore benefits as a special status \nstate, HPPCL will ensure that issues related to tribal, indigenous or ethnic minority people, as \nwell as other vulnerable groups,42 will be addressed and taken into consideration during the \nproject preparation stage, whenever there might be a risk of marginalization or discrimination. If \nimpacts on indigenous peoples are identified, mitigation will be undertaken commensurate with \nthe magnitude of project impacts and sensitivity levels. This will be done through preparation of \nan IPDP (if required), or integration of specific sections in favor of the indigenous people in the \nresettlement plan, based on ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). Keeping in view the \nMFF modalities, HPPCL has prepared a draft IPDF for the overall Investment Program. Based \non the initial social assessment of the tranche 1 subprojects, it is noted that tribal people living in \nthe vicinity of the subproject areas are mostly mainstream population. Therefore, no specific \nplan is required. However, special provisions will be made in the entitlement matrix of the \nresettlement plan. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 14 and the \nsummary resettlement plan is in Appendix 15. \n \n76.  The resettlement plans, resettlement framework, and IPDF have been disclosed to the \naffected  persons  and  were  posted  on  ADB\u2019s  website  prior  to  ADB\u2019s  Management  review \nmeeting. They are also available as Supplementary Appendix F. \n \nC.  Environmental Aspects \n \n77.  The  proposed  tranche  1  hydropower  projects  are  classified  ADB  environmental \ncategory A. Although the Kashang I, II and III projects can be classified category B, the \nSawra  Kuddu  project  (funded  in  tranche  1),  falls  in  category  A  because  of  (i)  the \nconstruction of a 3-hour peaking run-of-river barrage; (ii) the resulting effect on the aqua \nfauna and flora; and (iii) the submergence of 50.3 hectares (0.50 km2) of land, resulting in \nsubstantially reduced water flows and degradation of riverbanks between the barrage and \n                                                 \n38  Land for the intake site, powerhouse site, staff colony, and the approach road. \n39  Government of India. 2007.

Tenants and landless farmers were given    \n     free land by the Government to reduce poverty rates in the state. \n ", "  23\ntailrace outlet. Environmental impacts have been identified for both the Sawra Kuddu and \nKashang I, II and III projects. HPPCL prepared the subproject-specific EMPs. The hydropower \npolicy requires the maintenance of a minimum ecological flow43 in areas below the head race \ntunnel, so both projects are designed to comply with this requirement. Cumulative impacts, \nincluding downstream effects, have been determined and are being revised. Environmental \nsafeguard documentation is available in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n78.  For future tranches, HPPCL will ensure that all necessary environmental clearances are \nobtained  from  the  relevant  statutory  authorities  of  the  Government,  and  all  environmental \nmitigation measures set forth in the site-specific EMPs for each project are incorporated in \ndetailed  designs  (including  any  amendments  to  detailed  designs)  and  followed  during \nconstruction and operation of the subprojects. HPPCL will monitor, audit, and report twice \nannually to ADB the implementation of tranche-specific EMPs. A full EIA is required, and for any \nenvironment category A or B sensitive subprojects, an SEIA or SIEE will be prepared and made \navailable to the public 120 days before a PFR is submitted to ADB for approval. The SEIA will \nbe translated and made available to affected persons in the project area. EIA reports for the two \ntranche  1  subprojects  (Sawra  Kuddu  and  the  civil  works  of  Kashang  I)  have  been  made \navailable to ADB. The SEIA (Supplementary Appendix G) was completed and disclosed on \nADB\u2019s website on 28 April 2008.44 It is expected that draft EIA reports for future tranche \nsubprojects  will  be  available  on  the  following  schedule:  (i)  Sainj\u2014September  2008,  (ii) \nintegrated Kashang\u2014November 2008, and (iii) Shongtong Karcham\u2014February 2009. \n \n79.  Adequate provisions will be made in the Program to cover the environmental mitigation \nand monitoring requirements, and their associated costs. The project sites are located mostly on \nstate-owned land and, to a smaller extent, on privately owned land. The government-owned \nland and land acquired for the subprojects from private owners is mostly uninhabited and idle, \nand located outside of towns and villages. The subprojects are not located in or close to \nprotected  areas.  The  civil  works  contracts  will  incorporate  mitigation  measures  related  to \nconstruction as specified in the EMPs. Implementation of construction mitigation measures will \nbe  the  contractor\u2019s  primary  responsibility,  and  the  IA  will  be  responsible  for  implementing \ntranche-specific  EMPs.  The  principal  impacts  are  soil  erosion  at  construction  sites  and \ncatchment reservoirs, impacts on potable water resources, disruption to aquatic life including \nfisheries, loss of vegetation caused by potential forest and sub-forest clearing, management of \nconstruction waste, and excavated soil and rock disposal. These impacts will be mitigated by \nerosion control measures, provision of camp toilets, septic tanks, and soak pits, treatment in \nsettling tanks, reuse of excavation wastes wherever possible, controlled disposal of residual and \nexcavation wastes, and further by providing compensation for reforestation. HPPCL confirmed \nthat no endangered, rare, or threatened species of flora or fauna have been reported at any \nsubproject sites. \n \n80.   HPPCL will make tranche-specific subproject EIA studies available to ADB. In addition to \nproject-specific investigations and feasibility studies, sector development plans prepared by the \nCentral Water Commission, Central Electricity Authority, HPSEB, HPPCL, and other agencies \nwill also be provided. ADB consultants will review the documents to confirm that the proposed \nInvestment Program is consistent with ADB\u2019s energy, environmental, and social safeguards \npolicies.  \n                                                 \n43 Minimum ecological flow is 15% of 10-day threshold flow in a 90% dependable year. \n44 ADB. 2008. Environmental Assessment Reports for the Himachal Pradesh Clean Energy Development Investment \nProgram in India. http://www.adb.org/Documents/Environment/IND/41627/default.asp  \n ", "24   \nD.  Benefits and Beneficiaries \n \n81.  The overall objective of expanding clean energy generation in Himachal Pradesh will \ncontribute to state level economic development on several fronts. The first group of beneficiaries \nwill be local electricity consumers. Electricity from the proposed hydropower plants under the \nInvestment Program will go directly to the local grid, helping to fulfill growing local demand for \ngreater energy resources. Power consumption within the state consists of about 25% domestic \nusers, 7% commercial users, 59% industrial or bulk supply, and 9% irrigation and agricultural \nuse.45 The MFF is expected to result in more reliable power to consumers, and will rationalize \nthe cost of supplying power in the state by relying more on in-state power generation and thus \nreducing imports from the national grid. This will rationalize tariffs as well as improve the state \npower sector\u2019s financial viability.  \n \n82.  Industry is the largest consumer of electricity in Himachal Pradesh. Industry\u2019s share of \nstate domestic product increased from 1.1% in FY1950 to 15.9% in FY2004 while services \naccounted for 17.3% in FY2004, up from 5.9% in FY1950. As the dust-free and cool climate of \nHimachal Pradesh is suitable for the electronic and precision industries, electronic complexes \nhave been established, including the manufacturing of watches, thermometers, microscopes, \nhospital and laboratory equipment, televisions, and computer parts. Furniture making, rope \nmaking, bamboo products, and manufacturing and specialized wood-based industrial units have \nalso been established within the state. These industries are expected to benefit from low power \ncosts. Social services in Himachal Pradesh will also improve as poor and vulnerable consumers \n(including hospitals, schools, and other social utilities) that are often hardest hit by inadequate \npower supply, load shedding, and poor power quality, will benefit from the Investment Program. \n \n83.  The  second  group  of  beneficiaries  will  be  through  job  creation  as  a  result  of  the \nInvestment Program. For example, the contractors are expected to hire skilled and unskilled \nworkers for the projects\u2019 civil works. Jobs will also be available beyond the construction phase \nthroughout the projects\u2019 life cycles. GOHP has a policy that 70% of labor must be hired from \nwithin the state. \n \n84.  Third,  local  communities  in  the  project  areas  will  benefit  from  socioeconomic \ndevelopment programs financed through GOHP\u2019s policy of allocating 1.5% of total project costs \nto the community, with the funds to be administered by local area development committees led \nby community leaders. These funds will be earmarked for small-scale projects benefiting the \naffected communities as decided by the committees. As the total project costs for the proposed \ninvestment projects approaches $1.5 billion, funds approximating $22 million will be spent in the \ncommunities affected by the projects.46   \n \n85.  Clean energy development as promoted by this MFF will contribute to local, regional, \nand  global  environmental  initiatives.  In  addition,  the  Program  will  benefit  all  national  grid-\nconnected electricity consumers via the export of excess power for the benefit of poorer and \npower deficient states, and by eliminating the need to import power from the national grid, thus \nenabling the Government to meet its objective of developing the hydropower potential in the \ncountry. \n \n                                                 \n45 Averages of FY2007 actual figures and 2008 projections. HPERC. 2007. Tariff Order for Himachal Pradesh State \nElectricity Board (FY2007\u20132008). Shimla: Government of Himachal Pradesh (16 April). \n46 This is a GOHP policy and will be administered by GOHP and the local area development committees. Such funds \nare not part of ADB\u2019s funding packages and are thus outside of the scope of the projects. \n ", "  25\nE.  Potential Risks \n \n86.  The key broad assumptions under the Program are: (i) macroeconomic growth will \nremain  stable;  (ii)  GOHP  remains  committed  to  power  sector  reforms  and  institutional \nimprovement; and (iii) GOHP executes its investment plan, successfully combining physical \ninfrastructure investments with nonphysical investments in capacity development to maintain a \nsustainable power sector. Broad risks to the Investment Program include a slowdown in the \ndepth and pace of policy and sector reforms, including those related to regulation, governance, \nfinancial management, institutional change, and tariff regimes. \n \n87.  These  risks  can  be  mitigated  political  commitment,  concerted  action,  and  sound \nsupervision. GOHP is fully committed to expand its power supply and continue with sector \nreforms, including further tariff reform, improved corporate governance, institutional change, and \nincreased private sector participation. The state is closely following the execution of the long- \nand medium-term plans for the sector, where hydropower development has a prominent role, \nand  recognizes  that  capacity  development  is  a  major  part  of  the  process.  GOHP  is  also \ncommitted to the adequate development of the transmission network in the state, for which a \nseparate transmission utility has been envisaged.  The proposed interventions will help address \nthese issues at two separate levels\u2014state and project. The themes covered are broad (planning \nand  policy  formulation)  and  specific  (due  diligence,  project  preparation,  implementation, \nevaluation, monitoring, and reporting for results). Good governance and fiduciary controls are \nrecognized as important, along with measures to ensure transparency and efficiency.  \n \n88.  Specific subproject-related assumptions under the Program are: (i) the commitment of \nHPPCL to construct and operate the hydropower projects in a timely manner and maintain \nproper implementation supervision, including implementation of safeguard plans; (ii) there is no \nmaterial delay in concluding tariffs for the projects and/or on arrangements for the sale of \nexcess power;47 (iii) GOHP continues to support capacity development and assumes ownership \nof the capacity development components; and (iv) the subprojects will be eligible for CDM \nfinancing (purchase of carbon credits) and the CDM is extended beyond its 2012 end date.  \n \n89.  Specific subproject-related risks include delays in recruiting consultants, in the bidding \nprocess, and in procurement process. Another risk is the lack of, or delay in, counterpart \nfunding, including funds to HPSEB for construction of the transmission interconnections and \nrequired transmission lines. Construction risks include an increase in project costs and the \nimplementation time frame caused by (i) implementation issues (the greatest risk being due to \nencountering unexpected poor geological conditions); (ii) commodity price increases (such as \ncement, steel, fuel, and other raw materials) that effect cost estimates; or (iii) poor contractor \nperformance. Many of the structures are large, bear heavy loads and stresses, and/or deal with \ntenuous foundation conditions. However, the structures are of conventional design and require \nspecial but common construction practices, and the equipment is of conventional design and \nmanufacturing capability. There are also risks in quality of work and delays in construction. In \nall, the works require highly qualified civil works contractors and equipment manufactures. This \ncan be achieved through rigid application of ADB\u2019s guidelines for qualification of contractors and \nconsultants and close monitoring of the contracts. In addition, HPPCL has assigned skilled \nengineering staff resources to mitigate these inherent hydropower sector risks. To mitigate \n                                                 \n47 Currently, GOHP utilizes assigned, licensed power traders from PTC India (formerly Power Trading Corporation of \nIndia) to arrange for the sale of excess hydropower out of state during the peak summer period. GOHP intends to \nseek further opportunities in a transparent manner as power trading in India develops.   \n ", "26   \ncommodity price risk, contingency funds have been allocated to accommodate unforeseen price \nchanges.  \n \n90.  Overall, the integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs, given \nthe likelihood of the risks occurring. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n91.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and GOHP have given the \nfollowing assurances, which have been incorporated into the FFA or will be incorporated into the \nindividual loan agreement and project agreements, as appropriate. \n \nA.  Finance and Implementation \n92.  Counterpart Funding. The Government shall cause GOHP and/or HPPCL to make \navailable  all  counterpart  funds  required  for  timely  and  effective  implementation  of  the \nsubprojects, including funds required to meet additional costs arising from design changes, \nprice escalation in construction costs and/or unforeseen circumstances, and shall cause GOHP \nand/or HPPCL to make the resources thus required available on an annual basis.  \n \n93.  Merger.  GOHP shall ensure that no later than 31 December 2009, the legal merger of \nHPPCL, KKPC and PVPC has been completed. Unless ADB agrees otherwise, the merger must \nbe completed in such manner (i) that the operations of KKPC and PVPC have been for the risk \nand account of HPPCL as per 31 July 2007, (ii) that the assets and liabilities of KKPC and \nPVPC  have  been  transferred  to  HPPCL  at  historical  cost,  and  (iii)  that  these  assets  and \nliabilities comprise all KKPC\u2019s and PVPC\u2019s assets, contracts, approvals, instruments and other \narrangements  pertaining  to  the  project  facilities.  GOHP  shall  ensure  that  the  actual  and \ncontingent  liabilities  acquired  by  HPPCL  under  the  merger  comprise  solely  arm\u2019s-length \nobligations incurred by KKPC and PVPC in the normal course of business. Until such time that \nthe merger has been completed in accordance with the foregoing, HPPCL, KKPC and PVPC \nshall continue to operate as if the merger was completed already. \n \n94.  Financial Accountability and Transparency. By 31 March 2010, HPPCL shall have \ntaken the following measures to strengthen its internal audit functions: (i) adoption of internal \naudit guidelines in line with best practices; and (ii) appointment of internal controllers that report \nto the chairman and managing director of HPPCL on a regular basis. \n \n95.  The Government and GOHP shall allow and assist ADB's representatives to carry out \nrandom spot checks on the work in progress and utilization of funds for the subprojects. HPPCL \nshall announce the project and business opportunities associated with the subprojects on its \ncorporate website. \n \n96.  Debt Service Coverage Ratio. HPPCL will maintain a debt service coverage ratio48 of \n1.2 following the commencement of commercial operations of the first subproject. \n \n97.  Financial Management and other Recruitment. No later than 31 December 2008, \nHPPCL shall have recruited key finance staff, including an assistant general manager, a senior \n                                                 \n48 The standard formula comprises all free cash flows, expressed as the sum of revenues, less the sum of expenses \n(excluding depreciation and other non-cash operating charges, movements in working capital, and interest and \nother charges on debt), divided by the estimated debt service requirements in such year of the forecast.   \n ", "  27\nmanager, and such other managers as required by the positions sanctioned in its organization \nstructure and manpower plan dated 12 June 2008. GOHP will recruit a finance director for \nHPPCL as soon as possible, and no later than 30 September 2009. No later than 31 December \n2010, HPPCL will have recruited staff to meet all its other manpower requirements as laid down \nin the organization structure and manpower plan. \n \n98.  Tariff Filing. HPPCL shall submit to HPERC tariff applications for the subprojects in a \ntimely manner prior to commercial operations of each facility. GOHP shall ensure that the rate at \nwhich HPPCL sells the electricity it generates is established in accordance with, and meets the \nrequirements of, the relevant provisions of the Electricity Act, 2003. HPPCL will promptly submit \nall documentation reasonably requested by HPERC, including transmission service agreements \nor power purchase agreements as applicable. \n \n99.  Associated Facilities. The EA and HPSEB shall ensure that all additional transmission \nfacilities (including substations and power transmission lines) required to evacuate power from \nthe subprojects, are completed in a timely manner.  \n \n100.  Capacity  Development.  HPPCL  shall  analyze  the  recommendations  made  by \nconsultants under its capacity development component for adoption of suitable MIS, and agree \nwith  ADB  on  the  extent  and  manner  of  implementation.  HPSEB  shall  analyze  the \nrecommendations made by consultants under its capacity development component, and agree \nwith ADB on the extent and manner of implementation. \n   \nB.  Safeguards \n101.  Land Availability and Resettlement.  HPPCL shall, subject to compliance with the \nrelevant provision of the resettlement framework and resettlement plans and environmental \nassessment and review framework and EMP and in accordance with all applicable laws and \nregulations of India and Himachal Pradesh, acquire or make available the land and rights to \nland required for commencement of construction activities in accordance with the schedule \nagreed under the related civil works contracts, and will have cleared the utilities, trees, and any \nother obstruction from such land. \n \n102.  HPPCL  shall  ensure  that  the  resettlement  plans,  including  compensation  and \nentitlements  for  affected  households  and  persons,  are  implemented  in  conformity  with  all \napplicable laws and regulations of the Government, including as amended from time to time, \nand the entitlement benefits as listed in the Government\u2019s applicable laws, ADB\u2019s Involuntary \nResettlement Policy, and the resettlement framework. \n \n103.  HPPCL shall ensure that people affected by the project are fairly compensated in a \ntimely manner based on replacement values in accordance with the related resettlement plans \nand resettlement framework, such that their living standards are not adversely affected, and that \nthe payments will be made in a timely manner, prior to dispossession from land and other \nassets.  HPPCL  shall  submit  progress  and  completion  reports  on  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement under the quarterly progress reports for each subproject. \n \n104.  HPPCL shall ensure that prior to land acquisition and any resettlement for the project, \nthe relevant resettlement plan, including its update based on consensus of the affected persons, \nis disclosed with all necessary information made available to person affected by the project and \nconfirm that it be uploaded on the ADB website. \n \n ", "28   \n105.  The EA shall ensure that essential public infrastructure that may be affected by land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  is  replaced,  as  appropriate,  in  an  expeditious  manner  in \naccordance with the resettlement plans.  \n   \n106.

National Sector Structure \n1.  The Ministry of Power (MOP), Government of India (the Government), provides overall \npolicy level guidance for development of the country\u2019s power sector. State governments also \nhave  an  important  role  to  play  in  power  development  conforming  to  the  policies  of  the \nGovernment. The Electricity Act, 2003, requires MOP, in consultation with state governments, to \nreview and update the National Electricity Policy1 and the National Tariff Policy2 from time to \ntime. In all technical and techno-economic matters, MOP is assisted by the Central Electricity \nAuthority (CEA), a statutory body constituted under the Electricity Act. CEA is also mandated \nevery 5 years to prepare and ratify the national electricity plan in accordance with the national \nelectricity  policy,  after  obtaining  the  approval  of  MOP.  The  Central  Electricity  Regulatory \nCommission (CERC) and the state electricity regulatory commissions, which function in a quasi-\njudicial manner, are responsible for regulation of the sector\u2014including licensing, tariff setting, \nand  protection  of  consumer  interests.  An  appellate  tribunal  for  electricity  under  the  2003 \nlegislation was established to hear appeals against regulatory commissions or adjudicating \nofficers. Nuclear power generation is under the purview of the Department of Atomic Energy.  \n \n2.  The power generation, transmission, generation, and transmission facilities are mostly in \nthe central sector and state sector, and to a small extent in the private sector; there are also a \nfew  joint  ventures.  Power  trading  is  now  a  licensed  activity,  and  a  power  exchange  is \noperational. A broad schematic of the organizational and regulatory structure of Indian power \nsector is in Figure A2.  \n                                                 \n1 Ministry of Power, Government of India. 2005.

Provisions of the Electricity Act, 2003 \n3.   Electricity Act, 2003, is the cornerstone legislation for the power sector in India. The act \nprimarily  mandates  continued  restructuring  of  state  electricity  boards,  full  metering  for  all \nconsumer classes, open access to transmission systems, facilitation of power trading, and tariff \nrationalization.  It  provides  the framework  for  future  development  of  the  power  sector.  The \nEnergy Conservation Act, 2001, which came into effect in March 2002, is another important \nlegislation  having  significant  impact  on  power  development.  This  act  laid  down  concrete \nmeasures to ensure efficient use of energy and its conservation. A Bureau of Energy Efficiency \nhas been set up to make wide-ranging regulations to further the objectives of the act. In \naddition, the central and state governments have been empowered to facilitate and enforce \nefficient use of energy and its conservation. \n \n4.  The Electricity Act, 2003, includes a provision for MOP to update and publish a national \nelectricity policy regularly. The current policy document is dated 12 February 2005. Its broad \npolicy objectives include: (i) access to electricity for all households by 2010; (ii) demand to be \nfully met by 2012, with energy and peaking shortages to be overcome, and with adequate \nspinning reserves available; (iii) supply of reliable and quality power of specified standards in an \nefficient manner and at reasonable rates; (iv) per capita availability of electricity to be increased \nto over 1,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) by 2012; (v) minimum lifeline consumption of 1 kWh per \nhousehold per day as a merit good by 2012; (vi) financial turnaround and commercial viability of \nthe sector; and (vii) protection of consumers\u2019 interests. \n \n ", "40  Appendix 2 \n5.  In compliance with the Electricity Act, 2003, the Government has issued the national \nelectricity policy and the national tariff policy. The broad objectives of the policies are to:  \n(i)  ensure  availability  of  electricity  to  consumers  at  reasonable  and  competitive \nrates;  \n(ii)  ensure financial viability of the sector and attract investments;  \n(iii)  promote transparency, consistency, and predictability in regulatory approaches \nacross jurisdictions and minimize perceptions of regulatory risks; and \n(iv)  promote  competition,  efficiency  in  operations,  and  improvement  in  quality  of \nsupply.  \n \nC.

Though India has abundant reserves of coal and coal \nshall remain an important source for power generation in the medium term, India has also \ndecided to tread a low carbon path for meeting energy needs. Therefore, thermal power projects \ndeploying more efficient, super critical technology are being encouraged. Gas based power \ngeneration  shall  be  dependent  upon  the  availability  and  pricing  of  gas.    Nuclear  power \ngeneration shall be dependent upon the access to civilian nuclear technology and availability of \nnuclear fuel.  With about 9,000 MW of installed capacity, India is the 4th largest producer of \nwind power in the world. To address climate change issues, India has drawn up a National \nAction Plan, under which a Solar Mission has been detailed to promote solar power. India is \nalso giving emphasis to the conservation of energy. \n  \nD.  50,000 MW Hydro Initiative  \n7.  Hydroelectric power is recognized as one of the most economic and preferred energy \nsources because it is a low variable cost, clean, renewable energy source; and it is able to \nimprove system reliability via its instantaneous starting, stopping, and load-following capabilities. \nHowever, India\u2019s share of hydropower has been steadily declining during the last three decades, \nresulting in reductions in overall system efficiency. The Government recognizes the importance \nof  increasing  the  share  of  hydropower  generation  in  the  energy  mix  and  introduced  the \n\u201c50,000 megawatts (MW) hydropower initiative\u201d in 2003. Under this Program, pre-feasibility \nreports of 162 new projects, with an aggregate capacity of 47,930 MW distributed across \n16 states, have been prepared. Out of these 162 schemes, 73 schemes having first year \nindicative tariffs below Rs2.50 have been selected for preparation of detailed project reports and \nsubsequent implementation.3 The installed capacity of these schemes is about 33,000 MW. \nUnder this hydropower initiative, the north western and north eastern states, including Himachal \nPradesh, are given special incentives to promote hydropower development. \n \nE.  New Hydro Policy 2008 \n8.  In  order  to  further  address  the  rehabilitation  and  resettlement  issues  linked  to  the \nconstruction of the country\u2019s hydropower resources, the Government of India has announced \nthe New Hydro Policy 2008. This policy provides a level playing field to private developers, and \nelucidates  transparent  selection  criteria  to  be  used  by  states  for  awarding  sites  to  such \ndevelopers. The policy enables developers to earn revenues through merchant sales up to a \nmaximum of 40% of saleable energy (with penalties that reduce this benefit if there are delays in \nreaching commercial operations), with the balance to be sold under long term power purchase \nagreements. The policy seeks to balance incentives for private developers while containing \n                                                 \n3 The cost of preparation of detailed project reports is proposed to be recovered later from the developers. \n ", "  Appendix 2  41 \nprovisions designed to ensure that benefits flow to the project-affected persons. These benefits \ninclude 100 kWh of electricity per month to each project-affected family (in cash or kind or \ncombination), requirements for the project developer to assists in rural electrification in the \nproject-affected area  by contributing 10% of the states\u2019 share of electricity into Rajiv Gandhi \nGramin Vidyutikan Yojana (a rural electrification scheme initiated in 2005 by the Government of \nIndia), contributions to  local area development funds, and the setting up of industrial training \ninstitutes in the project-affected areas to improve employment opportunities for project affected \npersons. The rehabilitation and resettlement package for hydropower projects as specified in \nthis  policy  are  more  generous  than  the  requirements  of  the  National  Rehabilitation  & \nResettlement Policy, 2007. The new hydro policy aims to make the project-affected families \nstakeholders in the project. \n \nF.  Himachal Pradesh Sector Structure \n9.  MPP and Power Department. The Multipurpose Projects (MPP) and Power Department \nof the government of Himachal Pradesh (GOHP) was formed in April 1964 after realizing the \nneed for exploiting the substantial hydropower potential available in the state\u2019s river basins. \nAfter  transferring  power  development  and  operations  functions  to  Himachal  Pradesh  State \nElectricity  Board  (HPSEB)  upon  its  formation  in  1971,  the  department  has  focused  on \nformulating and implementing sector policies.  \n \n10.  Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board. HPSEB is a vertically integrated utility with \nresponsibility  for  electricity  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  in  the  state  since  its \nformation in 1971. HPSEB operates under state direction and interacts with the central power \nutilities for planning and coordination. The installed capacity of the state is 413.5 MW, with total \navailability including purchased power of around 1,900 MW. HPSEB\u2019s electric tariff is one of the \nlowest in the country, and ranges from a subsidized Rs0.70 per kWh to Rs4.0 per kWh, \ndepending on consumer type.   \n \n11.  Himachal Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (HPPCL). HPPCL was incorporated in \nDecember  2006  as  a  joint  venture  of  GOHP  and  HPSEB  to  develop  and  operate  new \nhydropower projects in the state. GOHP and HPSEB have a 60:40 participation, respectively.   \n \n12.  Himachal Pradesh Energy Development Agency (HIMURJA). HIMURJA is the nodal \nalternative energy agency responsible for promoting small hydropower projects up to 5 MW \ncapacity.  A  total  of  750  MW  of  small-scale  hydropower  projects  has  been  identified  by \nHIMURJA for development. \n \n13.  Himachal  Pradesh  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  (HPERC).  HPERC  was \nestablished and incorporated by GOHP on 30 December 2000. It is mandated to take measures \nconducive  to  the  development  and  management  of  the  electricity  industry  in  an  efficient, \neconomic, and competitive manner. HPERC also acts to safeguard consumer interests and \nimprove the quality of service. It functions in a quasi-judicial manner, and has the power to \nmake regulations for the conduct of its proceedings and discharge of its functions. Its main \nfunctions include determining electricity tariffs (bulk, grid, and retail) and transmission tariffs, \nregulating the power purchase process and promotion of competition, efficiency, and economy \nin the electricity sector. \n \n ", "42  Appendix 2 \nG.  Himachal Pradesh Power Sector \n1.  Government Strategy \n14.  Himachal Pradesh has abundant water resources in the five major rivers flowing through \nthe state from the western Himalayas. The power generation potential of Himachal Pradesh is \n20,415 MW, out of which only about 6,150 MW has been developed. GOHP\u2019s main strategy, \noutlined in its state hydropower policy,4 is the development of the state as the \u201chydropower \nstate\u201d of the country, by providing affordable, reliable, and quality power to its residents and \nexporting power to the national grid as a major source of revenue to the state. GOHP views the \nexploitation of the immense hydropower potential as a means for prosperity. Thus, it intends to \nspeed  up  hydropower  development  in  the  state  and  plans  to  add  about  4,021.5  MW  of \nadditional capacity during the 11th Five Year Plan (FYP). \n \n2.  Capacity and Constraints \n15.  Generation. The electricity supply for the people of Himachal Pradesh comes from its \nown state sector resources and allocated share of central sector-owned generation in the state. \nAs of March 2007, the installed capacity of the state sector, which is predominantly hydropower, \nis 523 MW. Himachal Pradesh experiences energy shortages, especially in the winter months of \nDecember to February when river flows are at their lowest, although some peak shortages are \nexperienced throughout the year. Currently, it is able to meet about 50% of demand from its \nown resources. During peak shortages, the state must draw power from the national grid, \ndepending on the system conditions. Conversely, the state supplies power to the national grid \nwhen generating excess hydropower. The power requirement of the state during FY2007 was \n5,136 million units of energy and 873 MW in terms of peak demand. The availability of power \nwas less than the requirement, and the state experienced an energy shortage of 2.7% as a \nresult. However, there was no peaking shortage during FY2006.5  \n \n16.  According to the 17th Electric Power Survey,6 power demand in Himachal Pradesh is \nexpected to increase from 4,861 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in 2006 to 9,504 GWh (1,611 MW peak) \nby FY2011 and 13,136 GWh (2,194 MW peak) by 2017. This implies compound average growth \nrates  of  energy  demand  of  11.37%  from  FY2006  to  FY2011  and  6.69%  from  FY2012  to \nFY2016. To meet this growing demand, GOHP\u2019s hydropower development plans must fructify. \nAs both the central sector and private investors are interested in developing hydropower in \nHimachal Pradesh for export to the national grid, the capacity additions earmarked for the state \nsector will serve local customers, with excesses during peak hydropower periods exported. Of \nthe 4,021.5 MW of additional capacity to be added by the end of the 11th FYP, the identified \nhydropower sites have been allocated to state, central, and private sector investors. Central \npublic  sector  utilities  are  expected  to  develop  about  2,243  MW,  the  private  sector  about \n1,488 MW, and the state sector about 290.5 MW (with an additional 810 MW intended to be \ncommissioned post-2012). An additional 750 MW of mini-hydropower (< 5 MW per site) is to be \ndeveloped privately under the lead of HIMURJA.  \n \n17.  Transmission. The state\u2019s transmission system consists of 2,100 kilometers (km) of \ntransmission  lines  rated  66  kilovolts  (kV)  and  above,  and  about  100  power  transformers \naggregating to around 2,000 megavolt-amperes (MVA) of capacity. The transmission system \nrequirements in Himachal Pradesh are different from most of India\u2019s power utilities in that, \nbesides meeting in-state demand, it also transfers significant amounts of power outside the \n                                                 \n4 Government of Himachal Pradesh. 2006.

New Delhi. \n ", "  Appendix 2  43 \nstate, particularly in the surplus months of April to October. The in-state transmission system is \ncapable of handling the additional capacity to be added through this proposed multitranche \nfinancing  facility  (MFF).  However,  with  the  considerable  hydropower  capacity  additions  in \nvarious stages of planning, development, and construction\u2014including central and private sector \ninvestments\u2014there will be a corresponding need for additional transmission capacity to be able \nto wheel the ensuing increase in power production. Such investments, however, are handled by \nPower Grid Corporation of India Limited, the national transmission company responsible for \ninterstate electricity transmission. Investments in this area have been announced and are in \nvarious stages of development. \n \n18.  Distribution. In 1988, Himachal Pradesh became the first hill state to achieve 100% \nelectrification  of  all  census  villages\u2014an  impressive  accomplishment  given  the  dispersed \ncustomer  base  and  mountainous  terrain.  Currently,  Himachal  Pradesh  has  around \n19,000 distribution transformers, 28,000 km of high tension lines, and 50,000 km of low tension \nlines. Himachal Pradesh is one of the few states in the country where energy delivered to \nconsumers is 100% metered. In addition, its distribution system has a high 97.4% availability. It \nis essential that every unit generated and delivered is accounted for and audited at different \nvoltage levels. Himachal Pradesh has achieved more than 90% metering on the distribution \ntransformers and on the feeders up to 33 kV, resulting in transmission and distribution losses of \na comparatively low 16.3% and aggregate technical and commercial losses of 26%.   \n \n19.  The power sector of Himachal Pradesh compares favorable to that of India as a whole, \nas shown in Table A2.1. However, the state still experiences power shortages due to the lack of \ngenerating capacity within the state. \n \nTable A2.1: \nSalient Village and Household Level Power Statistics \nItem  National  Himachal Pradesh \nAverage  Average \nVillage Electrification (%)  86.6  100.0 \nHousehold Electrification (%)  55.8  98.2 \nPer Capita Consumption (kWh)   636.0  775.0 \n  kWh = kilowatt-hour. \n  Source: Ministry of Power, Government of India.  \n \n20.  Institutional Capacity. Given the investment plans for additional hydropower capacity in \nHimachal Pradesh, there are capacity development needs within HPPCL in project development, \nplanning, and construction supervision. Additional needs include financial management and \nanalysis, record keeping, environmental impact assessment, and environmental management \nplanning.  HPERC\u2019s  capacity  development  objectives  are  to  support  enhancing  institutional \ncapacity, and to promote and update the regulatory framework to address upcoming sectoral \nissues effectively, especially implementation of the multiyear tariff regime as mandated by the \nElectricity Act, 2003. \n \n3.  Regulatory Reform Process \n21.  The Electricity Act, 2003, came into force on 9 June 2003. Himachal Pradesh already \nhad an established, functioning regulatory commission as of 2001, and has been issuing tariff \norders since then. Annually, HPSEB and other licensees are required to petition HPERC for \ntariffs, and after consideration of stakeholders\u2019 inputs, HPERC rules on tariff applications. The \nresulting tariff orders are the key instrument of regulation and sector governance. Licensees are \nallowed to appeal the tariff orders, which may eventually be resolved by court rulings. \n \n ", "44  Appendix 2 \n22.  HPERC holds regular review meetings to monitor compliance with the various directives. \nIn its tariff order for FY2006, it made efforts to reduce cross-subsidies and optimize power \npurchase  costs  by  mandating  the  procurement  of  power  on  a  merit  order  dispatch  basis. \nHPERC has also taken steps toward complying with the provisions of the Electricity Act, 2003, \nfrom  a  regulatory  perspective,  including  issuing  and  monitoring  performance  standards  for \nHPSEB,  constituting  a  forum  for  addressing  consumer  grievances,  and  appointing  an \nombudsman. In June 2005, it issued open access regulations.  \n \n23.  Sector Restructuring. HPSEB currently owns very little generation (329 MW total). \nHPPCL is to own and operate all planned state sector hydropower development, so it will \nbecome  the  state  generating  company.  The  corporatization  of  HPPCL,  supported  by  this \nproposed  MFF,  thus  effectively  unbundles  generation  from  HPSEB\u2019s  predominantly \ntransmission and distribution operations, and an eventual transfer of HPSEB\u2019s few generating \nassets to HPPCL is envisioned. Further to the process of HPSEB\u2019s restructuring, HPSEB has \ndrawn up a proposal for its unbundling. The first step is to unbundle the distinct operations \ninternally and account for them separately. In its FY2007 and FY2008 tariff filings, HPSEB \nunbundled its costs into generation, transmission, and distribution elements; and has adopted \nan approach toward unbundling, identifying, and isolating assets, costs, and revenues.  \n \n4.  State Investment Plan \n24.  GOHP\u2019s investment plan involves allocating identified hydropower sites to state, central, \nand  private  sectors  for  development.  For  hydropower  plants  allotted  and  under  execution, \ncentral public sector utilities are expected to take up about 3,100 MW, private sector about \n1,800 MW, and the state sector about 1,200 MW, with about 400 MW to be developed jointly. \nAn additional 750 MW of mini-hydropower (< 5 MW per site) is to be developed under the lead \nof HIMURJA.  \n \n25.  At the state level, additional new projects totaling about 1,700 MW will be allocated to \nboth HPSEB and HPPCL, which will each develop six to seven new projects. Looking beyond \nthe projects for which financing has been secured, additional funding of several billion US dollar \nequivalent is needed for future development. \n \n26.  HPSEB is preparing a transmission system master plan for the state. It will complete the \nplan by the end of 2008, including a schedule of capital expenditures for the next 5 years. This \nplan  will  include  substation  upgrades  and  additional  transmission  lines  required  for \naccommodating the anticipated growth in hydropower generation capacity. HPSEB will also \ncontinue its improvement of distribution system transformer metering to reach the goal of 100% \nmetering. \n \n5.  Private Sector Participation \n27.  GOHP  has  taken  several  initiatives  to  encourage  private  sector  participation  in \nhydropower development. Himachal Pradesh is among the few states that have streamlined and \ncrystallized the various procedures to minimize bottlenecks, and has come up with an investor-\nfriendly hydropower policy in place to attract private sector investment. The key features of the \npolicy are as follows: \n(i)  Selection of developers via memorandums of understanding (MOUs) is allowed \nfor projects up to 100 MW. \n(ii)  Selection  of  developers  via  international  competitive  bidding  is  applied  for \nprojects above 100 MW. \n(iii)  No clearances are necessary from CEA for projects selected via a competitive \nbidding process costing up to Rs2.5 billion, provided that (a) the scheme is \n ", "  Appendix 2  45 \nincluded in the national electricity plan as notified by CEA, and (b) the site for \nsetting  up  the  generating  stations  has  been  allocated  through  a  transparent \nbidding process in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Government. In \ncase of any other scheme, the Rs5 billion limit will apply.7  \n(iv)  The  secondary  energy  rate  is  at  a  par  with  primary  energy.  A  premium  is \nproposed on peak power. \n(v)  Simplification  of  process  of  transferring  clearances  to  independent  power \nproducers (IPPs). \n(vi)  Permission of 100% foreign equity on automatic approval route, provided it does \nexceed Rs15 billion. \n(vii)  Tariff determination by State Electricity Regulatory Commission or CERC as \napplicable. \n \n28.  The project developer will be required to provide a royalty in the form of free power from \nthe project to GOHP in the amount of 12% of the deliverable energy of the project for up to \n12 years from the date of commercial operation of the project; at 18% of deliverable energy of \nthe project for the next 18 years and thereafter; and at 30% of the deliverable energy for the \nbalance agreement period beyond 30 years.  \n \n29.  GOHP  will  constitute  a  local  area  development  authority  for  project(s)  being \nimplemented in each river valley. Activities of the authority during execution will be financed by \nthe project itself. For this purpose, the developer shall make a provision of 1.5% of total capital \ncost  in  the  detailed  project  report  other  than  the  funds  required  for  resettlement  and \nrehabilitation schemes and catchment area treatment plans. The authority\u2019s activities should be \nfinanced from the 1.5% provision proposed in the detailed project report and not from free \npower royalty. Activities under the local area development authority are as follows: \n(i)  oversee the restoration of facilities adversely affected by implementation of the \nproject; \n(ii)  oversee the implementation of rehabilitation and relief plan; \n(iii)  oversee the implementation of catchment area treatment plan and compensatory \nafforestation; \n(iv)  local development activities related to development of agriculture, horticulture, \nanimal husbandry, health and forest development, and other social activities; and \n(v)  the developer is to ensure minimum flow of 15% water immediately downstream \nof the dam to protect the rights of the local inhabitants for irrigation and drinking \nwater requirements. \n \n30.  The project developer will be required to arrange for evacuation of power from the \nproject to the applicable HPSEB or Power Grid Corporation of India\u2019s substation (designated as \nthe  interconnection  point).  For  evacuation  of  power  beyond  the  interconnection  point,  the \ndeveloper shall work with HPSEB or Power Grid Corporation of India as applicable to arrange a \nsuitable integrated transmission system at mutually agreed wheeling charges. \n                                                 \n7  According to the Electricity Act, 2003, any generating company can establish, operate, and maintain a generating \nstation without obtaining a license if it complies with the technical standards relating to grid connectivity specified \nby CEA.

The multitranche financing facility (MFF) combines physical investments with capacity \ndevelopment  work,  as  there  are  considerable  capacity  development  needs.  The  capacity \ndevelopment component contains a main subcomponent focusing on addressing constraints at \nthe Implementing Agency (IA) level. It is designed to address weaknesses identified by the \nprocurement capacity assessment (Supplementary Appendix E) and the financial management \nassessment  (Supplementary  Appendix  D).  The  main  focus  will  be  on  project  preparation, \nimplementation, and management, including (i) helping the Executing Agency prepare future \nprojects; (ii) implementing and administering approved projects; and (iii) monitoring, reviewing, \nevaluating,  and  reporting  on  program  and  project  implementation.  This  includes  project \nplanning,  construction  supervision,  contract  management,  procurement,  disbursements, \nsafeguards compliance, and monitoring and reporting systems. It will also include setting up the \nrequisite  project  management  units  within  Himachal  Pradesh  Power  Corporation  Limited \n(HPPCL). Financial management and accountability will be another major focus. This includes \nimproved accounting and auditing systems, while incorporating adequate financial management \nstandards to ensure fiduciary oversight of disbursed funds. A third focus will be the knowledge \ntransfer required for compliance with Asian Development Bank (ADB) policies and procedures, \nas none of the agencies have experience with ADB policies. \n \n2.  In  addition  to  project-oriented  capacity  development,  the  capacity  development \ncomponent will include corporate development assistance to HPPCL. There will be support for \nformulating an effective organizational structure with well-functioning project management units \nencompassing the duties, responsibilities, lines of supervision, and limits of authority for all \nofficers, managers, and other staff. Support will include hardware and software installation, \npolicy reformulation, and promoting private sector participation modalities. Training in the clean \ndevelopment mechanism (CDM) and public\u2013private partnership (PPP) modalities will round out \nHPPCL\u2019s functional expertise as the state\u2019s power generation company. HPPCL will thus be \ntransformed into a commercially oriented entity with a functioning board of directors supported \nby operating teams, finance, and administration. \n \n3.  Because of the large amount of hydropower capacity additions earmarked for Himachal \nPradesh, Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board (HPSEB), the state\u2019s transmission utility, is \nresponsible for the design and construction of the evacuation systems from hydropower projects \nto the transmission system, as well as ensuring adequate transmission capacity. Therefore, \nthere is a need for building capacity at HPSEB to introduce modern, computerized accounting \nsystems and management information systems (MIS) to ensure that HPSEB is able to manage \nand report on its operational activities properly. Taking this into account under the capacity \nbuilding component of the MFF, it was agreed to assist HPSEB in acquiring an enterprise \nresource planning solution to cover all its future computer accounting and MIS applications; and \nto finance the purchase of software, hardware, training, and initial system maintenance. HPSEB \nhas conducted the initial steps, such as carrying out a review of HPSEB\u2019s financial accounting \nand  management  information  system  requirements  with  particular  emphasis  on  project \naccounting and project management systems, financial management, financial reporting, and \ninformation requirements of Himachal Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (HPERC). \nHPSEB is in the process of developing the tendering documents. For this subcomponent, \nHPSEB will be the IA and will provide office space and counterpart staff for implementation. \nHPSEB will appoint a suitably qualified project manager to manage implementation of the \nenterprise resource planning solution.

Methodology and Major Assumptions \n \n1.  The financial analysis of the proposed subprojects under tranche 1 has been carried out \nin accordance with Financial Management and Analysis of Projects of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB).1 \n \n2.  All financial costs and benefits have been expressed in constant 2008 prices. Cost \nstreams used for financial internal rate of return (FIRR) determination, i.e., capital investment \nand operations and maintenance, reflect the costs of delivering the estimated benefits. The \ncurrent methodology to calculate tariffs for energy sales of hydropower generating stations was \nused  to  estimate  the  financial  benefits.  The  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  of \nHimachal  Pradesh  Power  Corporation  Limited  (HPPCL)  was  calculated  for  the  proposed \nsubprojects under tranche 1 and compared with the project FIRRs to ascertain the financial \nviability of the subprojects. The sensitivity of the FIRR to adverse movements in the underlying \nassumptions was also assessed. Based on this analysis, it is concluded that the subprojects \nunder tranche 1 are financially viable.  \n \n3.  While  tranche  1  of  the  MFF  will  finance  the  110  megawatt  (MW)  Sawra  Kuddu \nhydropower project except for the barrage, intake and desilting basin,2 and the civil works for the \n195 MW Integrated Kashang hydropower project, the evaluation must include the total project \ncosts. Therefore, costs include all civil works, electrical and mechanical works, resettlement, \nand environmental costs associated with each hydropower subproject. Financial viability was \nexamined by comparing the incremental costs and benefits of the with- and without-investment \nscenarios. The incremental benefits arise through the increased generation of power. It is \nassumed that the subprojects will have a 30-year economic life and residual value of 33% of the \noriginal investment at the end of the 20-year evaluation period. \n \n4.  The  tariff  principles  set  by  the  regulatory  agency,  Central  Electric  Regulatory \nCommission (CERC) in March 2004 allow HPPCL to pass through full cost recovery of the loan \ncapital (assuming a debt\u2013equity ratio of 70:30); depreciation (to cover principal repayments); \nreturn on equity (14%); operation and maintenance expenses (based on 1.5% of investment \ncosts);  and  interest  on  loans  and  working  capital.  The  above  tariff  revenue  streams  are \nconverted to real terms by adjusting for domestic inflation.  \n \n5.  While  tranche  1  subprojects  are  also  expected  to  produce  positive  environmental \nbenefits (from the clean development mechanism [CDM]), primarily in relation to the displaced \nelectricity generation from thermal sources, these have been excluded from the analysis.   \n \nB.  Calculation Weighted Average Cost of Capital  \n \n6.  To  compute  the  WACC,  it  is  assumed  that  the  financing  sources  would  consist  of \ngovernment of Himachal Pradesh (GOHP) equity contributions and foreign loans. The cost of \nHPPCL\u2019s equity is calculated at 14% as allowed by CERC tariff norms for pass-through in the \ntariff calculation. The analysis assumes that the ADB loan is passed through to GOHP and \nHPPCL in Indian rupees with interest rate including allowance for the Government\u2019s guarantee \n                                                 \n1 Asian Development Bank. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects (2005). Manila \n2 This particular contract package will be financed in tranche 2. \n ", "Appendix 12  59 \nfee and foreign exchange premium. The WACC is calculated on a pre-tax basis as taxes (33.6% \nof net profits)3 are allowed as a pass-through in the CERC regulations. The other assumption is \ndomestic inflation rate of 5.0%. Table A12.1 shows that the average WACC for the hydropower \ngenerating projects, both Kashang and Sawra Kuddu, is 3.6%.4 \n \nTable A12.1: Weighted Average Cost of Capital\u2014Kashang Subproject  \n(%) \nSource  ADB Loan  Equity   \nAmount ($ million)  208.0  89.0   \nWeighting  70.0  30.0   \nNominal Cost  6.6  14.0    \nTax Rate  0.0  0.0    \nTax Adjusted Nominal Cost  6.6  14.0    \nInflation Rate  5.0  5.0    \nReal Cost   1.5  8.6    \nWeighted  WACC  1.1  2.6  3.6% \nADB = Asian Development Bank, WACC = weighted average cost of capital. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nC.  Calculation of Financial Internal Rate of Return, Risk Assessment, and Sensitivity \nAnalyses \n \n7.  The FIRR is calculated at 7.0% for the Sawra Kuddu project and 6.7% for the Kashang \nintegrated project. These rates for the individual projects compare favorably with the estimated \nvalue of WACC at 3.6%, substantiating the financial viability of the tranche 1 subprojects.   \n \n1.  Risk Assessment and Sensitivity Analyses \n  \n8.  External Risks. Regulatory or tariff revision risk for the tranche 1 subprojects is minimal. \nThe current tariff has taken the investment plan into account and, if necessary, regulated \nentities can submit revised asset capitalization and financing plans and Himachal Pradesh \nElectricity Regulatory Commission (HPERC)5 will adjust the determination accordingly. There is \nno risk of downward revision since tariffs will not be changed unless HPERC is petitioned by the \nregulated entities to do so. Volume (i.e., demand) risk is minimal since the tariff allows for the \nbulk of revenues to be provided based on the capacity availability index, and Himachal Pradesh \nState Electricity Board (HPSEB) plants have exceeded the minimum 90% availability in the past, \naveraging 92% available capacity over the last 5 years. Geopolitical and political risks are \npresent for all projects in India. However, the nature of the investments and the overall shortage \nof power in India diversify this risk. Therefore, the overall risk to the financial sustainability of \nHPPCL is deemed to be minimal. \n \n9.  Project Specific Risks. Financial risks at subproject level include the following: (i) an \nincrease in the price of civil works and equipment, (ii) delays in project implementation, and \n(iii) failure to have access to necessary counterpart funds. These risks are considered low \nsince (i) the cost estimates were based on recent tenders received, and advance procurement \nwill reduce the time between loan effectiveness and disbursement; (ii) HPPCL\u2019s implementation \ncapacity  (based  on  projects  undertaken  by  HPSEB)  has  been  proven  in  recent  project \n                                                 \n3 Energy projects also attract a tax holiday of 10 years.  \n4 The WACC is the same for the Sawra Kuddu subproject, as the ratio of ADB loans to equity is also 70:30. \n5  Provided that the increases in costs can be substantiated, rather than simply cost overruns as a result of poor \nmanagement and construction practices. \n ", "60  Appendix 12 \nimplementation, with further support to be provided under the capacity development component; \nand  (iii)  HPPCL\u2019s  financial  projections  demonstrate  satisfactory  cash  flows  throughout  the \nforecast period to meet the repayment of debt associated with the investments, once projects \nare commissioned.  \n \n10.  Sensitivity Analyses. Separate analyses were carried out to examine the sensitivity of \nthe FIRR and financial net present value to adverse changes in key variables. The variables \nconsidered for the sensitivity analyses were a 10% increase in capital costs, a 10% increase in \noperation and maintenance costs, and a 10% decrease in revenues (allowable costs). Project-\nspecific tests include a 2-year implementation delay with a 20% increase in costs, and no \nallowance for residual values.  \n \n11.  Tables A12.2 and A12.3 demonstrate that the results are robust for each subproject with \nthe sensitivities exceeding the WACC. The project is most sensitive to cost overruns and delays. \nHowever, justifiable capital cost increases will be allowed by HPERC to be passed through into \nthe tariff, so this risk is minimized where justifiable cost increases and delays are incurred. \n \nTable A12.2: FIRR Sensitivity Analyses\u2014Sawra Kuddu Subproject \nFNPV  FIRR  SI  SV \nSensitivity Analyses  (Rs million)  (%)  (%)  (%) \nBase Case  1,583.7   7.0       \nCapital    +10  1,215.8   6.0  14.2  33.9 \nOperating    +10  1,498.1   6.9  2.4  203.3 \nBenefits    \u201310  971.8   5.7  18.1  (26.6) \nAll the above    518.3   4.7       \nTwo-year delay plus 20% increase capital cost  497.8   4.5       \nNo residual value  943.6   6.1       \nWACC           3.6       \n( ) = negative. \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return; FNPV = financial net present value, SI = sensitivity indicator; SV = switching \nvalue; WACC = weighted average cost of capital. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nTable A12.3: FIRR Sensitivity Analyses\u2014Kashang Subproject \nFNPV  FIRR  SI  SV \nSensitivity Analyses  (Rs million)  (%)  (%)  (%) \nBase Case  2,780.4   6.7       \nCapital    +10  2,075.2   5.8  14.5  31.7 \nOperating    +10  2,615.7   6.6  2.5  183.7 \nBenefits    \u201310  1,632.5   5.5  18.6  (24.8) \nAll the above    762.6   4.4       \nTwo-year delay plus 20% increase capital cost  712.0   4.2       \nNo residual value  1,549.3   5.7       \nWACC           3.6       \n( ) = negative. \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return; FNPV = financial net present value, SI = sensitivity indicator; SV = switching \nvalue; WACC = weighted average cost of capital. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n  \n \n \n ", "Appendix 13  61 \nSUMMARY OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Background and Approach \n \n1.  Economic analysis was undertaken to determine economic viability for each subproject \nto be funded from tranche 1. Analysis sought to determine and verify: \n(i)  electricity demand and supply projections;  \n(ii)  the presence of tranche 1 subprojects on the regional and national least-cost \nsystem expansion paths; \n(iii)  economic cost benefit analysis of tranche 1 subprojects, including sensitivities to \nkey variables; and \n(iv)  distribution of costs and benefits among stakeholders.  \n \n2.  Economic  benefits  will  accrue  from  incremental  electricity  consumption  and  from \ndisplacement  of  more  expensive  sources  of  energy.  Environmental  benefits  will  also  be \nachieved from the displacement of fossil fuel sources. Although only the first stage of Kashang \nis included in tranche 1 funding, economic analysis for the entire Kashang subproject was \nundertaken, rather than for the first stage as a stand-alone project. \n \nB.  Calculation of Economic Internal Rate of Return, Risk Assessment, and Sensitivity \nAnalyses \n \n3.  Program Costs. All costs and benefits have been expressed in constant 2007 prices. \nThe domestic price numeraire was used; tradable inputs were valued at their border price \nequivalent value and were converted to domestic equivalents using an estimated standard \nexchange rate factor of 1.04. Capital costs included physical contingencies, but excluded taxes, \nprice  contingencies,  and  financial  charges  during  construction.  The  incremental  costs  and \nbenefits of the tranche 1 subprojects were estimated by comparing with- and without-project \nscenarios. Electricity generated from the subprojects was assumed to be consumed within \nHimachal Pradesh, which is located within the northern region of the national grid. \n \n4.  Program Benefits. Electricity generated from the subprojects will be used to meet any \nunserved  demand  for  electricity  in  Himachal  Pradesh.  If  there  is  no  unserved  demand  in \nHimachal Pradesh, electricity from the subprojects will be sold into the northern region of the \nnational grid where it will be used to meet unserved demand. When there is no unserved \ndemand  in  the  northern  region,  electricity  generated  from  the  subprojects  will  be  used  to \ndisplace more expensive sources of generation\u2014primarily a diesel captive plant and coal-fired \nplant that is being used for peaking duties. Non-incremental outputs from the subprojects were \nvalued at the resource cost savings that would accrue if the subprojects were to proceed. In \nvaluing the output from the subprojects, it was assumed that most captive generation will be \ndisplaced before coal-fired generation from the grid is displaced.  \n \n5.  Incremental  outputs  were  valued  using  Himachal  Pradesh  and  northern  region \nconsumers\u2019 estimated willingness to pay for incremental consumption, adjusted for medium \nvoltage  and  low  voltage  losses  as  appropriate.  Demand  functions  relating  energy  price  to \nenergy demand were estimated for each of the three main consumer sectors in Himachal \nPradesh (domestic, industrial, and commercial) and the four main consumer sectors in the \n ", "62  Appendix 13 \nnorthern region (domestic, industrial, commercial, and agricultural), following the methodology \noutlined in Measuring Willingness to Pay for Electricity1 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).  \n \n6.  Tranche 1 subprojects are also expected to produce positive environmental benefits, \nprimarily in relation to the displaced electricity generation from thermal sources. Benefits have \nonly been quantified as a sensitivity case, using a realistic estimate for the value of carbon \nemission  reduction  credits  that  the  subprojects  could  possibly  attract  in  the  international \nmarketplace  if  an  application  for  clean  development  mechanism  (CDM)  certification  was \nsuccessful. A conservative value of $10 per credit was used (i.e., $10 per ton of certified carbon \ndioxide emissions avoided) to reflect uncertainty over credit price and over the continuation of \nthe CDM program beyond 2012. \n \n7.  Estimation of Economic Internal Rate of Return. A period of 25 years was used for \neconomic  evaluation.  Investment  is  assumed  to  take  place  in  the  period  2008\u20132014,  and \nbenefits are assumed to be realized from 2013. A residual value was assumed, based on an \neconomic asset life of 50 years. Detailed cost\u2013benefit calculations show that the subprojects are \nexpected to deliver significant economic benefits. Kashang delivers an estimated economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) of 17.8% and Sawra Kuddu delivers an estimated EIRR of 20.7%.  \nThe combined EIRR is estimated to be 18.7% (Table A13.1). \n                                                 \n1 P.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe power sector has great potential to contribute to economic development and social well-being, but infrastructure facilities \nneed to be expanded and managed more effectively to ensure consistent economic growth in India. Development of the power \nsector is connected to poverty reduction. Clean power development ensures that the poor will benefit, as they bear a larger \nshare of the adverse impacts of pollution and environmental degradation. In addition, stable electricity supplies promote \nbusiness expansion and increase employment opportunities, which can have a positive impact on reducing poverty. \n \nPolicy reforms that lead to sector sustainability can free up resources for other pro-poor initiatives. Policy reforms that will lead \nto private sector development in the sector will also support improvements in service accountability, transparency, and \naccessibility. \n \nMore specifically, the Program will contribute to economic development, health, and education in India through expanded \npower supplies; and will develop clean energy by supporting selected investments in hydropower generation and associated \ntransmission system expansion to facilitate sector sustainability and protect the environment. \n \nAs Himachal Pradesh is 100% electrified, the local population will benefit from a more reliable power supply. Electricity from \nthe proposed hydropower plants under the Investment Program will go directly to the local grid, helping to fulfill local demand \nfor greater energy resources. The overall objective of expanding clean energy generation will contribute to state level economic \ndevelopment on several fronts.  \n \nFinally, social services in Himachal Pradesh will improve as poor and vulnerable consumers (including hospitals, schools, and \nother social utilities) that are often hardest hit by inadequate power supply, load shedding, and poor power quality, will benefit \ndirectly from the Investment Program. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:  General Intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nHimachal Pradesh is quite a rich state, compared to the rest of the country. Having obtained the status of \u201ctribal\u201d state, its \npopulation has benefited from investments and subsidies form the central Government. In addition, the state government has \napproved a series of pro-poor policies, including the abolition of tenancy, which resulted in a redistribution of land to the \nlandless to fight exploitation of labor and increase the productivity of the land. \n \nNow, 100% of the Himachal Pradesh population owns land (with the exception of Nepali labor) and most of them have invested \nin the highly profitable apple orchards business. \n \nThe local population will still benefit from the Project, as it will provide them with a more secure and reliable source of \n a\nelectricity. In addition, in its hydropower policy , the government of Himachal Pradesh provided that 1.5% of the Program\u2019s \ntotal cost would go back to the affected communities, which will decide (in a fully participatory way) how to use it for \nsocioeconomic development activities. \n \nContractors are expected to hire skilled and unskilled workers for a period of 10 years for civil works. There will also be jobs \navailable beyond the construction phase throughout the projects\u2019 life cycles. Nonetheless, as labor comes usually from the \nlandless segment of the population, the number of people hired locally is expected to be limited.  \n \n2. Design Features  \nNo direct impact on poverty is envisaged to occur as result of the implementation of this Program. Nonetheless, it will have \nindirect impacts on both Himachal Pradesh and India as a whole. \n \n \n \n \n ", "66  Appendix 14 \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.    Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nProject-affected communities are expected to be impacted both negatively (resettlement and environmental impacts) and \npositively (job opportunities and the opportunity to implement local socioeconomic development programs financed through the \n1.5% allocated by the program authorities). In addition, health and education conditions and facilities are expected to improve \nin Himachal Pradesh as well as the rest of the country served by the northern grid, because of access to more reliable \nelectricity. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nAs an integral part of the safeguards planning, affected communities and affected persons were directly and fully involved in \nthe project preparation and during the design. All stakeholders were informed and the stream of information will continue during \nthe implementation of the Program. Consultations were held to ensure participation and minimization of the negative impacts. \nMoreover, the affected communities will be in charge of deciding how to spend the 1.5% of the project cost for the development \nof socioeconomic schemes to be implemented locally. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \n \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, consultant \ninput, etc.). If no, explain why.  \n \nC&P was considered as a part of the more extensive resettlement planning exercise. Local communities and affected persons \nwere consulted throughout the preparation process to minimize impacts, ensure social acceptance, and increase equitability. \nThe process will continue during the implementation of the Program. Views and concerns of all stakeholders will be taken into \nconsideration and addressed whenever feasible. Finally, local customs, religious practices, and traditional activities have been \nconsidered as a fully integrated part of the preparation process to avoid discrimination and/or disruption of activities, as \nminimization measures. \n \nC.

Overview and Project Description \n \n1.  Himachal Pradesh Clean Energy Development Investment Program (the Program) will \nbe provided under a multitranche financing facility (MFF) lending approach over 5 years, which \nwill facilitate clean power generation, transmission, distribution, and sector reforms in Himachal \nPradesh with minimum adverse environmental and social impacts. The Program initially will \nsupport selected investments in hydropower generation and associated transmission system \nexpansion to facilitate sector sustainability. It will include the following components; (i) Sawra \nKuddu Hydroelectric Project, 111 megawatts (MW); (ii) Kashang Hydroelectric Plant, 195 MW \n(to be built in stages over two tranches); (iii) Sainj Hydroelectric Plant, 100 MW; (v) Shongtong \nKarcham  Hydroelectric  Plant,  402  MW;  and  (vi)  the  Capacity  Development  Program  for \nHimachal  Pradesh  Power  Corporation  Limited  (HPPCL)  and  other  sector  agencies.  The \nhydropower development components will provide a total capacity of 745 MW with a combined \ngeneration  of  3,045  gigawatt-hours  (GWh)/year  at  90%  dependability.  The  capacity \ndevelopment  program  will  provide  support  for  development  of  the  operating  departments, \ne.g., technical, finance and accounting, environment and social, procurement, personnel, and \nfor  carrying  out  specific  tasks  such  as  physical  investments  and  sector  reforms  and \nrestructuring. The first tranche will cover construction of the Sawra Kuddu project, the civil works \nfor the Kashang project, and the capacity development component.  \n \n2.  The  summary  resettlement  plans  are  prepared  for  first  tranche  subprojects\u2014Sawra \nKuddu and the civil works of Kashang. The Sawra Kuddu project is located in the district of \nShimla and the Kashang subproject is in the district of Kinnaur. The impact on land acquisition \nand resettlement for the Kashang subproject is insignificant, so a short resettlement plan was \nprepared. The impact for Sawra Kuddu is significant, so a full resettlement plan was prepared. \nBoth the resettlement plans are based on the final engineering design, according to the detailed \nproject reports. Efforts have been made by the engineering team to minimize resettlement.  \n \nB.  Impact on Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n3.  The  total  private  land  required  for  acquisition  is  49.42  hectares  (ha),  out  of  which \n45.75 ha is required for Sawra Kuddu and 3.67 ha for Kashang (stage 1). A census and \nsocioeconomic survey was conducted in the subproject affected area to assess the impact. A \ntotal  of  193  households  will  be  affected.  Kashang  stage  1  will  affect  30 households  and \nSawra Kuddu will impact 165 households. Only two residential structures will be affected in \nSawra  Kuddu;  the  Kashang  subproject  will  not  affect  any  structures.  All  households  are \ntitleholders. There will be no impact on community and cultural property. A total of 2,446 trees \nwill be affected. In Sawra Kuddu, 48 sharecroppers and agricultural laborers will be affected. A \ntotal of 878 persons and 50 vulnerable households will be affected. Although recognized tribes \nand castes will be affected, they will not be considered indigenous peoples as defined within the \nPolicy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Therefore, no \nindigenous peoples development plan (IPDP) is prepared for the subprojects. These tribes and \ncastes have been considered vulnerable, and additional assistance has been provided for in the \nresettlement plan. There will be no negative impact on women; rather, women will benefit from \nthe Program. A summary of land acquisition and resettlement impacts is in Table A15.1. \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 15  69 \n \nTable A15.1: Summary of Impacts on  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \nSummary  Quantity \nImpact  Type of Impact  Kashang  Sawra  Total \nNo.  Stage 1  Kuddu \n1  Total area of land for acquisition (ha)  3.67  45.75  49.42\n2  Total number of households affected  30  165  195 \nTotal number of households losing \n3  30  163  193 \nagricultural land \nTotal number of residential structures  \n4  0  2  2 \naffected \nTotal number of community property \n5  0  0  0 \nresources affected \n6  Total number of vulnerable households  36  14  50 \nTotal number of sharecroppers and/or \n7  0  48  48 \nagricultural laborer \n8  Total number of trees  1196  1250  2446 \n9  Total number of titleholders  30  165  195 \n10  Total number of non-titleholders  0  0  0 \n11  Total number of affected persons  147  731  878 \n     ha = hectare \n     Source: Government of Himachal Pradesh. \n \n4.  For the Sawra Kuddu subproject, the Executing Agency (EA) has already started the \nland acquisition process. About 32 ha of land have already been acquired and compensation for \nthe land has been disbursed to the affected persons. The assessment of land and identification \nof affected persons for the remaining 13.75 ha of land is in process\u2014section 4 and other \nrelevant  sections  of  the  Land  Acquisition  Act,  1894,  have  been  initiated  for  this  purpose. \nCompensation for the remaining land has been fixed by the EA through its designated land \nacquisition officer, and disbursement for the remaining land is due. The compensation is based \non the market rate, which is at replacement value. \n \nC.  Resettlement Policy, Legal Framework, and Entitlement Matrix \n \n5.  The policy framework and entitlements for the Program are based on national laws\u2014the \nLand Acquisition Act, 1894 (amended in 1984), and the national rehabilitation and resettlement \npolicy1\u2014and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) and Policy on Indigenous Peoples. \nThe Himachal Pradesh hydropower policy2 is also considered. The core involuntary resettlement \nprinciples for the Program to be followed for each subproject, including tranche 1 subprojects, \nare: (i) land acquisition and other involuntary resettlement impacts will be avoided or minimized, \nexploring  all  viable  alternative  subproject  designs;  (ii)  where  unavoidable,  time-bound \nresettlement plans will be prepared and affected persons will be assisted in improving or at least \nregaining  their  pre-program  standard  of  living;  (iii)  consultation  with  affected  persons  on \ncompensation, disclosure of resettlement information to affected persons, and participation of \naffected persons in planning and implementing subprojects, will be ensured; (iv) vulnerable \ngroups will be provided special assistance; (v) compensation will be paid to affected persons, \nincluding non-titled persons (e.g., informal dwellers and/or squatters, and encroachers), for \nacquired  assets  at  replacement  rates;  (vi)  compensation  will  be  paid  and  resettlement \n                                                 \n1 Government of India. 2007.

During the preparatory stages, consultations were carried out with various government \nofficials and local communities for both subprojects as part of the social and resettlement study \nto gather their views on the proposed Program. Different consultative techniques were used with \nstakeholders,  including  in-depth  interviews,  public  meetings,  and  group  discussions.  To \nunderstand the socioeconomic profile of the affected persons, questionnaires were designed \nand information was collected from the affected persons on a one-to-one basis. Focus group \ndiscussions are also in progress in the project influence areas. For the Kashang stage 1 \nsubproject, focus group discussions were conducted at Pangi village and Reckong Peo in \nNovember 2007; 30 people participated in the consultation and shared their views. Census \nsurveys of all 30 affected households were conducted on a one-to-one basis. For the Sawra \nKuddu subproject, around 100 affected households have been consulted as part of the census \nsurvey. Additionally, 98 households were surveyed as part of a sample socioeconomic survey in \nNovember and December 2007 in the subproject-affected zone. Focus group discussions were \nconducted at rural and urban areas of the Sawra Kuddu subproject area, such as Mandhol \nvillage (6 December 2007), Sari village (28 November 2007), Jhalta Chowri (3 December 2007), \nHatkoti town (29 November 2007), Bharot village (30 November 2007), Mandal (1 December \n2007), and Mungra village (2 December 2007). About 85 participants representing various \ngroups participated in the consultations. Consultations have also been carried out with special \nemphasis on the vulnerable groups. Most of the people are aware of the proposed Program and \nexpressed their cooperation for smooth implementation of the subproject. The consultation \nprocess will be continued during the entire project cycle.  \n \n7.  Draft  resettlement  plans  will  be  made  available  in  relevant  local  government \ndepartments in Kinnaur district for the Kashang stage 1 subproject and in Shimla district for the \nSawra Kuddu subproject. They will also be made available in project implementation unit (PIU) \nand project management unit (PMU) offices. Resettlement plans will be made available in the \nlocal  language.  Finalized  resettlement  plans  will  be  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website,  and \ninformation  dissemination  and  consultation  will  continue  throughout  implementation  of  the \nInvestment Program.  \n \n8.  An efficient grievance redress mechanism will be developed to assist affected persons in \nresolving queries and complaints. Grievances will first be brought to the attention of the PIU. \nGrievances not redressed by PIU staff (field level) will be brought to the grievance redress \ncommittee, which will have representatives from affected persons, PMU, PIU, environment and \nsocial  management  unit,  field  level  staff,  district  magistrate  and/or  commissioner,  local \nadministration,  revenue  authority,  and  local  community.  The  main  responsibilities  of  the \ncommittee are to (i) provide support to affected persons on problems arising from land and/or \nproperty  acquisition;  (ii)  record  affected  persons\u2019  grievances,  categorize  and  prioritize \ngrievances, and resolve them; (iii) inform the PMU immediately of serious cases; and (iv) report \nto affected persons on developments regarding their grievances and decisions of the committee \n ", "Appendix 15  73 \nand PMU. Other than disputes relating to ownership rights under the court of law, the committee \nwill review grievances involving all resettlement benefits, compensation, relocation, replacement \ncost,  and  other  assistance.  It  will  meet  every  month  (if  grievances  are  brought  to  the \ncommittee), determine the merit of each grievance, and resolve grievances within a month of \nreceiving the complaint\u2014failing which, the grievance will be referred to the appropriate court of \nlaw for redress. Records will be kept of all grievances received, including contact details of the \ncomplainant,  date  the  complaint  was  received,  nature  of  the  grievance,  agreed  corrective \nactions, date of such action, and final outcome. The committees will continue to function during \nthe life of the Program, including the defects liability period. \n \nE.  Institutional Arrangements \n \n9.  The MPP and Power Department, government of Himachal Pradesh is the executing \nagency (EA) of the proposed MFF, and HPPCL is the implementing agency (IA). The IA will \nhave a specific PMU and there will be different PIUs. Each of the component hydropower \nprojects will be implemented independently through the PIUs. Keeping in view the capacity of \nHPPCL, it is proposed that an environment and social management unit be set up within the \nPMU, along with other engineering units, to address environmental and social issues of the \nProgram. A nongovernment organization (NGO) will oversee implementation of the resettlement \nplan, along with implementation of resettlement and rehabilitation assistance. The roles and \nresponsibilities of various agencies involved in resettlement activities are summarized in Table \nA15.3. \n ", "74  Appendix 15 \n \nTable A15.3: Roles and Responsibilities of Agencies in Resettlement Plan \nImplementation \nActivity  Responsible Agency \nSubproject Initiation Stage \nSetting up of ESMU and staff  HPPCL \nFinalization of sites for subprojects  HPPCL, PMU, PIU \nDisclosure of proposed land acquisition and subproject details  HPPCL, PMU, ESMU \nby issuing public notice \nMeetings at community and/or household level with affected  HPPCL, ESMU, PMU, PIU \npersons \nFormation of valuation committee   HPPCL, PMU, PIU, Appropriate \nGovernment \nResettlement Plan Preparation and Updating Stage \nConducting census of all affected persons  PMU, PIU, ESMU,  Land Acquisition \nOfficer (LAO) \nConducting focus group discussions, meetings and workshops  PMU, PIU, ESMU \nComputation of replacement values of land and/or properties  PMU, PIU, ESMU \nproposed for acquisition and for associated assets   \nCategorization of affected persons for finalizing entitlements  PMU, PIU, ESMU, LAO \nFormulating compensation and rehabilitation measures  PMU, PIU, ESMU, LAO \nConducting discussions, meetings and workshops with affected  PMU, PIU, ESMU \npersons and other stakeholders   \nFixing compensation for land and/or property with titleholders  VC, PMU, PIU, ESMU, AO \nFinalizing entitlements and rehabilitation packages  PMU, PIU, ESMU, LAO \nDisclosure of final entitlements and rehabilitation packages  PMU, PIU, ESMU \nApproval of resettlement plan  EA, PMU, ESMU, ADB \nSale deed execution and payment  EA, PMU, ESMU, LAO, Appropriate \nGovernment \nTaking possession of land  EA, HPPCL, PMU \nResettlement Plan Implementation Stage \nUpdating of various categories of affected persons  PMU, PIU, ESMU, LAO, NGO \nImplementation of proposed rehabilitation measures  PMU, PIU, ESMU, LAO, NGO \nConsultations with affected persons during rehabilitation  PMU, PIU, ESMU, NGO \nactivities \nGrievances redress   PMU, PIU, ESMU, GRC, NGO \nInternal monitoring  PMU, PIU, ESMU, NGO \nExternal monitoring  External Agency \nEA = executing agency; ESMU = environmental and social management unit; GRC = grievance redress committee; \nHPPCL = Himachal Pradesh Power Corporation Ltd.; LAO = land acquisition officer; NGO = non government \norganization; PIU = project implementation unit; PMU = project management unit; VC = village council. \nSource: Himachal Pradesh Power Corporation Limited. \n \nF.  Resettlement Budget \n \n10.  The  resettlement  cost  estimate  for  the  tranche  1  subprojects  include  eligible \ncompensation, resettlement assistance, and support cost for implementation of the resettlement \nplan. These are part of the overall project cost.  \n \n11.  The major features of this resettlement and rehabilitation cost are (i) compensation for \nland at replacement value; (ii) compensation for structures (residential) and other immovable \nassets at replacement cost; (iii) compensation for crops and trees; (iv) assistance instead of loss \nof business, wage income, employment or livelihood; (v) assistance for shifting the structures; \n(vi) assistance for documentation and administrative fees; and (vii) assistance for vulnerable \n ", "Appendix 15  75 \ngroups\u2019 livelihood restoration and (viii) other costs for implementation of the resettlement plan. \nBased  on  the  above,  it  is  estimated  that  the  total  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  cost  is \nRs675.42 million, out of which Rs67.25 million is for Kashang stage 1 subproject and Rs608.17 \nmillion for the Sawra Kuddu subproject. All land acquisition, resettlement, and compensation will \nbe completed before the start of civil works and adequate budgetary provision has already been \ninitiated by the EA. \n \nG.  Implementation Schedule \n \n12.  The implementation schedule for resettlement plans are structured according to the \noverall subproject implementation. All activities related to land acquisition and resettlement must \nbe planned to ensure that compensation is paid prior to displacement and commencement of \ncivil  works.  Public  consultation,  international  monitoring,  and  grievance  redress  will  be \nundertaken  intermittently  throughout  each  subproject\u2019s  duration.  However,  the  schedule  is \nsubject to modification depending on the progress of project activities. As part of advance \nactions, the EA will establish the PMU, PIU, environment and social management unit, and \ngrievance  redress  committee;  and  appoint  an  NGO  for  resettlement  implementation.  The \nproposed  subproject  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  activities  are  divided  into  three  broad \ncategories based on the work stages and implementation process: (i) project preparation phase, \n(ii) resettlement plan implementation phase, and (iii) monitoring and evaluation phase.

Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n13.  Resettlement plan implementation will be closely monitored to provide the PMU with an \neffective basis for assessing resettlement progress and identifying potential difficulties and \nproblems. Internal monitoring will be undertaken by the PIU, with assistance from the PMU \nenvironment  and  social  management  unit.  Monthly  progress  reports  will  be  prepared  and \nsubmitted to the PMU. The EA will appoint an independent agency to undertake external \nmonitoring. The independent agency will monitor subprojects twice a year and submit reports \ndirectly to the EA. The EA will submit all external monitoring reports to ADB for review. Broadly, \nthe monitoring and evaluation system will involve (i) administrative monitoring including but not \nlimited  to  daily  planning,  implementation,  feedback  and  troubleshooting,  individual  affected \nperson file maintenance, and progress reporting; (ii) socioeconomic monitoring including but not \nlimited to case studies, using baseline information for comparing affected person socioeconomic \nconditions,  evacuation,  demolition,  salvaging  materials,  morbidity  and  mortality,  communal \nharmony,  dates  for  consultations,  number  of  grievances,  and  resolutions;  and  (iii)  impact \nevaluation monitoring including but not limited to income standards restored or improved.  \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20081021095404+08'00'", "Subject": "Proposed Multitranche Financing Facility", "Author": "ms7", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Keywords": "himachal pradesh clean energy, multitranche financing facility, management information system, himachal pradesh state electricity, financial management assessment, india power sector reforms, hydropower resources, renewable energy, adb project 41627", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20081028144325+08'00'", "Title": "Himachal Pradesh Clean Energy Development Investment Program"}, "author_page": " \n  TA  \u2013  technical assistance \n  WACC  \u2013  weighted average cost of capital \n \n \n \nWEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n \n  GWh  \u2013  gigawatt-hour \n  Ha  \u2013  hectare \n  Km  \u2013  kilometer \n  kV  \u2013  Kilovolt \n  kW  \u2013  kilowatt (1,000 watts) \n  kWh  \u2013  kilowatt-hour \n  MVA  \u2013  megavolt-ampere \n  MW  \u2013  megawatt (1,000 kilowatts) \n \n \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of the Government and its agencies ends on 31 March. \nFY before  a  calendar  year  denotes  the  year  in  which  the  fiscal  year  ends, \ne.g., FY2008 ends on 31 March 2008. \n(ii)  In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVice-President  B.N.
