INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Kyrgyz Republic became a member of the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) on 12 \nAugust 2015.1 The country\u2019s accession to the EEU is expected to have diverse and significant \nimplications for the country\u2019s economy. With the EEU\u2019s combined population of about 180 \nmillion and its larger market, the intended free movement of goods, services, capital, and labor, \nand  elimination  of  customs  controls  and  nontrade  barriers,  the  EEU  presents  significant \neconomic  opportunities  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  The  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  economic  policies, \nregulations, and the legal framework need to be adjusted to those of the EEU, and the potential \neconomic and social costs of the accession need to be minimized. It is in this context that the \nGovernment of the Kyrgyz Republic has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide the proposed technical assistance (TA),2 which was included into the country operations \nbusiness plan, 2015\u20132017.3  \n \n2.  Consultations with representatives of the government, the country\u2019s private sector and \nthink tanks, and development partners took place during the reconnaissance and fact-finding \nphases of TA preparation.4 The government expressed its concurrence with the TA design as \ndescribed in the August 2015 fact-finding mission\u2019s memorandum of understanding. The design \nand monitoring framework of the TA is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Excluding  the  small  island  states,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  one  of  ADB\u2019s  smallest \ndeveloping member countries in terms of land area, population, and size of the economy. The \ncountry\u2019s  real  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  is  extremely  volatile,  reflecting  significant \ndependency on several factors and vulnerability to external shocks.5 The country has strong \neconomic ties with the Russian Federation, through remittances of the Kyrgyz workers, currency \nmovements, trade, and investment channels.6 \n \n4.  The Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s accession to the EEU occurs in the challenging internal and \nexternal economic environment, including economic slowdowns in the Russian Federation and \nin Kazakhstan.7 Both developments exert a downward pressure on the Kyrgyz economy, largely \nthrough the remittances and trade channels. Remittances started to fall 22.5% in the last quarter \n                                                \n1  The treaty establishing the EEU was signed on 29 May 2014 by the presidents of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and the \nRussian Federation, and came into force on 1 January 2015. Armenia became a member of the EEU from 2 \nJanuary 2015. The Agreement on the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s Accession to the EEU was concluded on 23 December \n2014, and its final protocols finalized on 8 May 2015. Subsequently, these legal documents were ratified by all EEU \nmembers\u2019 parliaments.  \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 1 September 2015.  \n3   ADB. 2014. Country Operations Business Plan: Kyrgyz Republic, 2015\u20132017. Manila. \n4   Among other relevant development partner assistance to the Kyrgyz Republic are the bilateral assistance on \nelimination of customs controls by Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation; an International Monetary Fund (IMF) \nassessment of the impact of the accession to the EEU; and various ongoing projects by the World Bank Group, \nUnited Nations Development Programme, and United States Agency for International Development aimed at \nbusiness support, promotion of agricultural and nonagricultural value chains and exports, food safety, and others. \n5  For example, real GDP growth in the last 5 years recorded: \u20130.5% (2010), 6.0% (2011), \u20130.1% (2012), 10.5% \n(2013), and 3.6% (2014). The gold sector is a key element of the economy, accounting for more than 40% of \nexports and more than 20% of industrial production, with the Kumtor Gold Company alone accounting for 8% of \nGDP. \n6  The Russian Federation employs up to 1 million Kyrgyz citizens (about one-fifth of the population). Remittances \nfrom the Russian Federation\u2014an important source of private consumption\u2014are estimated at 25% of GDP. \n7  The Russian GDP is expected to decline by 3.5% in 2015, and Kazakhstan\u2019s economic growth to slow down from \nthe earlier 4.8% forecast to 2% in 2015. It is also expected that the feed-through effects from the Russian \nrecession on migrant workers\u2019 transfers are expected to last longer this time than in 2009. \n ", "2 \n \nof 2014, and declined by more than 25% in the first half of 2015 (year-on-year). The sharp \ndepreciation of the Russian ruble and the devaluation of the Kazakh tenge have put pressure on \nthe som, which depreciated against the US dollar by 20% in 2014, and by 14.5% since the \nbeginning of this year, resulting in higher inflation. Together with the lower expected gold \nproduction in 2015, the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s real GDP growth is forecast to fall to 1.7%, down from \n3.6% in 2014.8  \n \n5.  The undiversified economy, driven mainly by gold production and remittances-backed \nprivate consumption, limits economic opportunities at home and leads to high unemployment. \nGiven the country\u2019s limited economies of scale and significant economic vulnerabilities, regional \neconomic integration is essential for the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s economic prospects and its people\u2019s \nlivelihoods. \n \n6.  The Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s accession to the EEU will impact the country\u2019s economy via the \ntrade, migration, and investment channels.9 For the Kyrgyz Republic, the key issues include the \nelimination of customs controls at intra-EEU borders, an increase in duties on imports from \noutside the EEU, the adoption of the EEU technical regulations and standards, and the supply \nresponse from the specific sectors of the Kyrgyz economy, in particular, agriculture and food \nprocessing, garment, and the re-export sector.10 In addition, the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s commitments \nand obligations under the World Trade Organization, of which the country is a member since \n1998, would need to be reconsidered in light of the EEU membership.  \n \n7.  The recurrent theme in the discussions with key stakeholders during the preparation of \nthe proposed TA was the ensuing uncertainty as to the implications of the country\u2019s accession \nto the EEU. The following emerged as key issues related to the country\u2019s accession to the EEU: \n(i)  the  economic  opportunities  and  risks  to  the  country\u2019s  economy;  (ii)  the  considerable \nchallenges during this transition period; (iii) the central and local government agencies\u2019 weak \ncapacities related to the accession to the EEU; and (iv) the need for better and wider public \nawareness of the issues pertaining to the accession to the EEU, especially among the country\u2019s \nbusiness sector. \n \nIII. THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The proposed TA will support the Kyrgyz Republic following its accession to the EEU, \nwith the view of capturing the economic opportunities presented by the EEU\u2019s larger market and \nits free movement of goods, services, capital, and labor, and minimizing the potential economic \nand  social  costs  of  the  accession.  The  impact  of  the  proposed  TA  will  be  the  improved \nprospects of the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s economy within the framework of the EEU. The outcome of \nthe TA will be the improved capacity and capability of the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s government to \n                                                \n8   In response to the unfolding economic difficulties and to help offset the impact of the Russian economic slowdown \nand other external factors, the government requested the IMF to provide an extended credit facility, and the IMF \napproved the $92.4 million financing package in April 2015. IMF. 2015. Kyrgyz Republic: Request for a Three-Year \nArrangement Under the Extended Credit Facility. Washington, DC. \n9  These implications should be distinguished from the macroeconomic shock facing the Kyrgyz economy caused by \nthe 2014\u2019s Russian ruble devaluation and the economic slowdowns in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan. \n10  Re-export of goods, mainly from the People\u2019s Republic of China and Turkey to other countries, comprises a \nsignificant part of the Kyrgyz economy, and contributes to employment and income. \n ", "3 \n \nformulate and adopt sound economic and social policies pertinent to the country\u2019s accession to \nthe EEU.11 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The  above  outcome  of  the  TA  will  be  achieved  through  the  following  outputs  and \nactivities. \n \n10.  Output 1: Policy advice and analytical support on the Eurasian Economic Union \naccession  issues.  These  will  include  policy  advice  and  analytical  support  for  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic\u2019s government on strategic issues, to ensure that the Eurasian Economic Commission\u2019s \ndecisions do not have a detrimental effect, and are in the interests of the country\u2019s development. \nSpecific issues for analytical and monitoring support include macroeconomic impacts, adoption \nof the common external tariff of the EEU, impact on trade, labor and investments, coordination \non specific technical regulations, and impact on selected sectors of the economy.12  \n \n11.  Output 2: Improved methodology, coverage, and collection of statistical data to \nmonitor the impact of the country\u2019s accession to the Eurasian Economic Union. The \nKyrgyz Republic\u2019s national statistics have limited methodology, scope, and coverage, severely \nhindering  a  routine  monitoring  of  economic  developments.13 This  component  will  focus  on \nimproving the methodology, coverage, and collection of data on \u201cmutual trade\u201d in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic, compatible and \u201cmirror\u201d trade statistics with EEU member countries, better statistics \non labor migration and remittances, and other indicators required for the meaningful monitoring \nof the impact of the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s accession to the EEU.14 \n \n12.  Output  3:  Tailored  training  and  public  awareness  programs  to  capture  the \neconomic  opportunities  presented  by  the  Eurasian  Economic  Union. To  address  the \ndearth  of  information  on  changes  in  economic  policies,  regulations,  technical  standards, \nlegislative documents, etc., both among the public and private sectors, which hinders their \nadaptation to the new realities of the economy, this component will focus on training and public \nawareness programs specifically tailored for key stakeholders: central and local governments, \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises, individual entrepreneurs, business associations, and the \ncountry\u2019s think tanks.15  \n \n13.  The following key risks to the TA project\u2019s implementation need to be considered: (i) \npolitical instability that can derail the initiated economic reforms; (ii) the weak voice of the \nKyrgyz Republic in the supranational bodies of the EEU, which is dominated by larger EEU \n                                                \n11 The TA\u2019s sustainability will be one of its key principles, in the sense that the TA\u2019s outcome will go beyond the EEU \naccession issues. \n12 Analytical  support  will  focus  on  systemic  issues,  such  as  the  development  of  methodologies  for  various \nassessments and appropriate training of Ministry of Economy (MOE) staff. For example, the TA will develop a \nmethodology for assessing the impact of the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s accession to the EEU on various sectors of the \neconomy (including agriculture, textile industry, construction materials, and others), and will conduct a pilot \nassessment for a selected sector of the economy; or a methodology for regulatory impact analysis of regulations of \nthe Eurasian Economic Commission on the Kyrgyz economy. \n13  Attempts at formal economic modeling and scenario analysis (for example, within a computable general equilibrium \nframework, a standard tool for assessing general economic impacts) are constrained in the case of the Kyrgyz \nRepublic. \n14 \u201cMutual trade\u201d denotes exports and imports between the EEU member countries. \n15 Examples include the need to address unawareness among the country\u2019s businesses engaged in re-export and \nother trade operations regarding changes in the tax administration procedures associated with accession to the \nEEU, or establishment of a call center for clarification of various technical (for example, phytosanitary and \nveterinary) regulatory issues for companies and business associations. \n ", "4 \n \nmember countries; and (iii) frequent turnover of government staff that may result in ineffective \nuse of policy advice and recommendations. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $600,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space and supplies, and other in-kind \ncontributions. The Ministry of Economy (MOE) and other relevant government agencies and \ndepartments will provide the required materials, information, and data. The cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The MOE is the state agency responsible for the overall coordination of the Kyrgyz \nRepublic\u2019s accession matters, and it will be the executing agency for the TA. The TA will be \nadministered by ADB. Several MOE departments and divisions will be involved in the TA, \nincluding the Department on Accession to the EEU and the World Trade Organization Issues, \nthe Department of Technical Regulations and Metrology, the Macroeconomic Department, the \nDepartment of Strategic Planning and Regional Development, and the Department of External \nAid Coordination. The MOE will assign the TA coordinator (the deputy minister in charge of the \nEEU accession) to support and coordinate all TA activities, and to assist with absorption of the \nTA outcomes into the MOE\u2019s work and activities. \n \n16.  A TA steering committee will be established under the chairmanship of the minister of \neconomy,  and  will  comprise  senior  government  officials  from  the  executing  agency,  the \nGovernment Staff Department, Ministry of Finance, National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz \nRepublic, and other relevant agencies. The steering committee will oversee TA implementation \nand recommend adjustments to the TA scope, if needed. During the TA implementation, the \nMOE  will  coordinate  activities  of  all  relevant  stakeholders,  including  the  central  and  local \nauthorities involved in the project, as well as the activities of other development partners in this \narea. \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, from January 2016 until December 2017. \nThe  TA  will  engage  12  person-months  of  international  and  32  person-months  of  national \nconsulting services in the field of macroeconomics, international trade and regional economic \nintegration, statistics, and others. The outline terms of reference for the consulting services is in \nAppendix 3. The consultants will be engaged on an individual basis,16 and a national consulting \nfirm will be engaged to implement the training and public awareness component. Resource \npersons (to be engaged for round tables, seminars, and study tours) will be recruited from ADB \nmember countries using the single-source selection method. All consultants will be recruited in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime). All procurement of goods will be conducted in accordance with ADB's Procurement \nGuidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  equipment  will  be  used  for \nimplementation of the TA and will be transferred to the executing agency at TA completion. All \ndisbursement under the TA will be carried out in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n                                                \n16 The preliminary search for potential firms in ADB member countries with suitable expertise and experience in the \nEEU, its policies, regulations, and institutions, has identified no such firms.  \n ", "5 \n \n18.  A series of round table discussions and workshops will be held under the TA, with \nparticipation  of  external  experts,  analytical  organizations,  development  partners,  and  other \nrelevant stakeholders. An evaluation of the TA outputs and outcomes will be carried out at the \nend of the TA and reflected in the TA completion report. \n \n19.  The TA will be monitored through biannual review of the TA implementation, involving \nsubmissions of progress reports by the consultants, and consultations with the government \nduring TA review missions.  \n   \nIV. THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  for  Accession to the  Eurasian  Economic  Union\u2014\nCapturing the Opportunities and Addressing the Risks, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nImproved prospects of the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s economy within the framework of the Eurasian Economic \nUnion (Action Plan on Adaptation of the Kyrgyz Republic to the EEU, 2015\u20132016). \n  Performance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome  2015 baseline: 0     \nImproved  a.
