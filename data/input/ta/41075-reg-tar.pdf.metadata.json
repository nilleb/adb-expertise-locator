Coordinating natural resource management for sustainable development is a strategic \nobjective of the Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines East Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA) Road Map to Development \n(2006\u20132010). This objective is central to economic growth in the subregion, where production \nsystems  are  largely  based  on  natural  resources.  Growth  must  also  be  sustainable  to \ndrastically reduce the incidence of poverty, estimated at 50%.1 Sustainability rests on better \nmanagement of the subregion\u2019s natural resources, which are among the richest repositories of \nthe earth\u2019s biodiversity. The Sulu-Sulawesi Marine Ecoregion (SSME), at the center of the \nCoral Triangle, and the Heart of Borneo (HOB) are part of the growth area.2   \n \n2.  The action plan of the BIMP-EAGA Road Map, released in 2006, calls for a natural \nresource management program for the subregion. The program is foreseen to cover joint \nenvironmental  protection  activities  particularly  in  border  areas,  projects  fostering \ncomplementary resource use among member countries, and activities in support of SSME and \nHOB, flagship projects of BIMP-EAGA. Such a program should strengthen the link between \nenvironmental protection and economic growth in BIMP-EAGA and also bring more coherence \nand synergy to multi-country agreements, plans, implementation mechanisms, and resources \nfor the SSME and HOB, as well as for the ASEAN program that deals with the problem of \ntrans-boundary haze. The urgent need for a BIMP-EAGA regional environment program (REP) \nwas affirmed during the Fact-Finding Mission on 10\u201328 September 2007.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Unsustainable Use of Natural Resources. The natural resource base of the BIMP-\nEAGA countries is in fast decline. Logging, mining, and farm expansion have deforested the \nuplands. Indonesia lost 64 million hectares of forest, or 60% of its total, between 1950 and \n2000, and the loss is continuing at the rate of 2 million hectares a year. Even forest under legal \nprotection is not safe. Around 56% of protected lowland forest in Kalimantan, Indonesian \nBorneo,  was  wiped  out  between  1985  and  2001.  This  loss  only  intensifies  the  threat  of \nextinction  of  a  wide  range  of  life  forms  supported  by  the  forest.  Fires  caused  by  farm \nexpansion have produced haze reaching as far as Singapore and the Philippines. In 1997 and \n1998, fires razed more than 3.2 million hectares of forestland in Kalimantan.  \n \n4.  The sea is not faring any better. Fish stocks have diminished to unsustainable levels as \na result of overfishing and the use of destructive fishing methods. The catch per unit effort in \n75% of fishing grounds in the Philippines has dropped so steeply that experts warn of a \npossible  crash  of  selected  stocks  in  the  next  10  years  unless  the  management  regime \ndrastically improves.3  Around 70% of the SSME in the Philippines has been affected. Global \nwarming, fed partly by the rise in carbon emissions and the decrease in carbon sinks,4 may \nhasten these losses through coral bleaching and ecological disequilibrium. The use of more \nfossil fuels as the subregion\u2019s economy grows adds to carbon emissions, even as the forest \n                                                 \n1  BIMP-EAGA has a population of about 60 million, half of them living on less than $2 a day (Cheetham, R. 2005. \nBIMP-EAGA Subregion Cooperation Study. Australian Agency for International Development). \n2  The 900,000 square kilometer SSME has the highest marine biodiversity in the world and the Coral Triangle is \ntagged as the Amazon of the Sea. HOB is the largest contiguous forest in Southeast Asia.  It covers 220,000 \nsquare kilometer remnant frontier forest and one of few refuges left for the orangutan, the Asian elephant, and the \nSumatran rhinoceros. \n3 Pauly, D. 2004.

While  the  current \nmanagement of resources may bring short-term economic gains, it presents a long-term threat \nto 54 million people from over 350 ethno-linguistic groups. The very poor, who depend most \nheavily on natural resources for their livelihood, will bear the brunt. \n \n5.  Need  for  a  Strategic  Framework  for  Environmental  Conservation  in  the \nSubregion. The only policy instrument that guides natural resource management in BIMP-\nEAGA is the Road Map to Development and its action plan. One of the six components of the \naction plan is sustainable development and environmental management by means of three \nstrategies: (i) developing a framework for intra-EAGA cooperation in the integrated protection \nand management of natural resources and biodiversity; (ii) identifying and developing viable \nand sustainable joint investment projects in forestry, fishery, minerals, and energy; and (iii) \nencouraging and supporting greater private sector participation in sustainable natural resource \ndevelopment projects and environmental protection programs. The REP will carry out these \nstrategies.  Without  the  REP,  BIMP-EAGA  has  no  standards  for  ensuring  that  its  natural \nsystems have the regenerating capacity to match the resource extraction rate, and that it is \nequipped with the proper safeguards to avoid and mitigate adverse impact. \n \n6.  Three-country agreements for the management of SSME and HOB are in place. SSME \nhas a conservation plan in varying stages of implementation in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the \nPhilippines, and these countries are drawing up a conservation plan for HOB. The SSME \nconservation plan will have to be reviewed and revised in the light of the lessons learned from \n4 years of implementation, so that it complements more closely the BIMP-EAGA action plan. \n \n7.  Limited Resource Management Capacity. BIMP-EAGA is faced with a number of \nchallenges in putting together an effective program for natural resource management, and \nstrengthening coordination and cooperation among the many agencies that are responsible for \nthe  environment  and  natural  resources.  The  complex  institutional  arrangements  for  the \ndevelopment of the subregion include the Business Council (BEBC), which represents the \nprivate sector. Lack of information on trade flows and trends in natural resource use hampers \nthe  BEBC\u2019s  capacity  to  coordinate  the  activities  of  private  investors  and  to  promote \ninvestments in environment and sustainable resource management. Eleven working groups \nmade up of government and private sector representatives support program development and \nimplementation. These are organized into four clusters; in the natural resources development \ncluster are working groups in agro-industry, fisheries cooperation, forestry and environment \nand energy, and human resource development.  \n \n8.  The working groups are led by government staff who are only intermittently involved in \nBIMP-EAGA operations. The Facilitation Center and the BEBC secretariat are thinly staffed for \nroutine administration; they can neither provide technical support for REP development and \nimplementation nor effectively mobilize and coordinate support from donors. SSME and HOB, \nthough flagship projects of BIMP-EAGA, have yet to receive concrete support from it. The \nSSME tri-national committee needs increased financial support for its regular functions. The \nHOB tri-national body, on the other hand, has yet to start operating. BIMP-EAGA is in a \nposition to rally stakeholder groups to support its flagship projects, but it must have adequate \nresources and improved capability to do so. \n \n9.  Need  for  Sustainable  Financing  for  Environmental  Conservation.  BIMP-EAGA \nrelies heavily on government funds to operate. Government agencies in the member countries \ndraw from their limited budgets to fund their subregional activities. However, there is not \nenough government financing for sound environmental management. Similarly, private sector \norganizations depend on their own funds. Coordination and cooperation among donors must \nalso improve to strengthen institutional support for environmental conservation in BIMP-EAGA.  \n \n ", "      3\n10.  Some in government and the private sector see the need for a subregional fund facility \nto support activities particularly for the implementation of the development road map and \naction plan. The mechanics for the establishment of such a fund would have to be developed, \nespecially if a long-term program for natural resource management is to be implemented and \nsustained. Given the varying levels of development and capacity of the member countries, the \nless adequately resourced cannot be expected to cover their cost of managing trans-boundary \nresources for the common benefit. The result of carrying out a program without such a fund is \nevident in SSME. Its program implementation was seriously impaired when the fund set aside \nfor it by the Government of the Philippines was depleted and unreplenished, and even more so \nwhen supplementary funds from nongovernment organizations (NGOs) were reduced.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The regional technical assistance (RETA)5 will strengthen the sustainable management \nof natural resources in the BIMP-EAGA. It will produce an agreed design for a REP for BIMP-\nEAGA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  A program for the proposed implementation period of 15 years, in three 5-year cycles, \nwill be prepared within 18 months (March 2008 to September 2009). The RETA will adopt the \nfollowing strategies; it will (i) use research-based information to define options and make \ndecisions  for  sustainable  resource  management;  (ii)  engage  multisector  and  multilevel \nstakeholder participation for broad-based program ownership and wider support; (iii) build on \nexisting  policies,  plans,  intercountry  agreements,  institutional  arrangements,  and \naccomplishments to consolidate the gains and accelerate progress; (iv) secure the required \nlong-term commitment from stakeholders and donors to sustain the program results in a large \nand complex implementation setting; and (v) consider fully the interaction of factors shaping \ncommon threats and opportunities for environmental protection to generate a coordinated and \nsynergistic response for the subregion.6 The following activities will be carried out during \nprogram formulation: \n \n(i)  Activity  1:  Preparing  environmental  and  socioeconomic  profiles  of \nBIMP-EAGA. The profiles will be prepared to determine: (a) the environmental \nand socioeconomic characteristics of the member countries and the subregion, \n(b) common environmental issues and trends and the impact of socioeconomic \nactivities on environmental degradation, (c) the issues that the BIMP-EAGA \nREP must address, and (d) the activities that will best support the BIMP-EAGA \nREP. A technical team will be formed in each member country for the purpose. \nThe data will come mainly from secondary sources. Rapid appraisal methods \nmay be applied to verify the secondary data and collect primary data. The \ncountry data will be consolidated into a subregional profile. The data will be \ntranslated into geographic information, using geographic information system \n(GIS) technology, to produce maps that reflect national and local jurisdictions, \ndrainage, existing and planned land use, forest types, critical habitats, critical \n                                                 \n5  This TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 2 November 2007. \n6  The implementation of this RETA will be closely coordinated with the following technical assistance projects, \nwhich have recently been approved or have been proposed for consideration: (i) ADB. 2007.  Regional Review of \nthe Economics of Climate Change in Southeast Asia. Manila (TA 6427 - REG, approved on 10 December, for \n$904,200); (ii) ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance for Regional Connectivity in Infrastructure in Archipelagic \nSoutheast Asia (aSEA). Manila (TA 6441 - REG, approved on 19 December, for $2,750,000); and (iii) ADB. 2007. \nTechnical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Preparing the Regional Roads Development Project. \nManila (for approval on 14 February 2008, for $1,300,000).  Synergies across these TA projects will ensure \nappropriate support for the protection and conservation of the regional forest ecosystem and biodiversity in HOB.  \n ", "4     \nspecies population and distribution, resource use by type, threats by source \nand type, routes of migratory species, existing initiatives by type, infrastructure, \ndemographic distribution and density, ethnic distribution, economic production, \nand poverty incidence.  \n \n(ii)  Activity  2:  Assessing  policies  and  institutional  capabilities.  The  policy \nassessment will cover the BIMP-EAGA development road map and action plan, \npolicies of the BEBC, and multi-country agreements and plans for SSME, HOB, \nand haze prevention. The assessment will be based on the relevance of these \npolicy  instruments  to  the  major  environmental  issues  and  trends  in  the \nsubregion as defined in activity 1, and the efficiency and effectiveness with \nwhich the policies are being implemented. Gaps in policies will be identified and \nrecommendations will be made, including several that will be included in the \nREP.  The  institutional  capability  of  the  implementing  institutions\u2014their \nmandate, structure, administrative systems, number and skills of personnel, \nlogistics,  financial  sustainability,  and  support  linkages\u2014and  their  bias  or \norientation toward decentralization and degree of participatory management will \nalso  be  assessed.  These  institutions  include  the  BIMP-EAGA  Facilitation \nCenter,  the  national  secretariats,  BEBC  and  its  secretariat  and  associate \nbusiness  groups,  the  SSME  tri-national  committee,  HOB  technical  working \ngroups, and the office in the ASEAN secretariat that manages the ASEAN \ntrans-boundary haze work program. The institutional requirements for policy \nimplementation  through  standard  setting,  monitoring,  selected  technical \nassistance, country complementation, and self-regulation will be estimated. The \nresults will indicate the institutional capabilities and shortfall and go into likely \ninterventions under the proposed REP. \n \n(iii)  Activity 3: Formulating a 15-year program. The aim is to draw stakeholder \ninputs and support for the program. In a series of consultation meetings, the \nstakeholders will validate the result of activities 1 and 2, identify the issues, \ndefine  the  sustainability  indicators  for  the  subregion,  and  propose  future \ncourses of action. These local, national, and subregional meetings will result in \nthe following: (a) actions to be carried out at the subregional level, (b) actions \nsupporting the ASEAN haze program and SSME and HOB and linking these to \nthe overall REP, and (c) actions intended to strengthen the capability of BIMP-\nEAGA  institutions  to  implement  the  REP.  A  technical  team  will  study  the \nfeasibility  of  the  actions  with  the  following  principles  in  mind:  efficiency  of \nresource  use,  equity  of  access,  balance  between  competing  uses,  use  of \nenvironmentally sound technologies, payment for environmental services, and \ncollaboration of stakeholder groups. The REP will run for 15 years in three 5-\nyear cycles.  \n \n(iv)  Activity  4:  Generating  government  support  and  forging  broad \npartnerships for action. The proposed program will be submitted for review to \nthe governments of the countries in the subregion and to the BEBC. Their \nrepresentatives and the technical team will consult and agree on any needed \nrevisions or adjustments in the program. The program will also be circulated to \nmultilateral  and  bilateral  agencies,  private  sector  groups,  and  NGOs.  Their \nsuggestions and participation in plan implementation will be sought. \n \n ", "      5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The RETA is estimated to cost $1.7 million, $1.5 million of which will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program.7 The governments of the four member countries will \neach  contribute  $50,000  in-kind  through  counterpart  support  services.  Each  country  will \nfinalize its contribution before the RETA implementation. The detailed cost estimates and \nproposed financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the RETA.  The World Wildlife Fund for Nature \n(WWF), through its national organizations operating in the EAGA has the necessary regional \nand national expertise to provide technical and operational services for the RETA under the \n1998  Policy  on  Cooperation  between  ADB  and  NGOs,  and  the  2001  ADB\u2013WWF \nMemorandum of Understanding.  WWF is the world\u2019s largest environmental NGO and has a \nwell-established network. Its work in conservation and development is widely recognized, \nincluding its involvement in on-going initiatives in SSME, HoB and transboundary haze which \nare  part  of  the  proposed  TA.  WWF  has  more  than  15  years  of  work  experience  in  the \nsubregion with national organizations in three EAGA countries. It has a proven record of \nsuccessful collaboration with governments, the private sector, donor agencies, NGOs, and \nlocal  communities;  a  long-established  presence,  particularly  in  biodiversity  hotspots;  and \navailable counterpart resources to commit to the RETA. ADB will therefore engage WWF \nthrough single source selection to undertake the environmental and socioeconomic profiling, \nGIS mapping, and stakeholder consultation meetings.  \n \n15.  At  the  regional  level  the  BIMP-EAGA  will  provide  the  institutional  framework  for \nprogram development.  The EAGA functions through regular meetings of working groups. \nTwice-yearly meetings of senior officials and annual meetings of leaders are held back to back \nwith the ASEAN summits. Singapore will be invited by the natural resources cluster of working \ngroups to participate as a strategic partner of ASEAN in sector discussions with the EAGA \ncountries. The BIMP-EAGA is the institutional home for the RETA, and it will work closely with \nthe natural resources cluster and its groups in forestry and the environment, energy, fisheries, \nand agro-industry\u2014all key targets of the RETA. This RETA will be part of the program of the \nnatural  resources  cluster,  which  will  coordinate  with  ADB  in  preparing,  overseeing,  and \nfacilitating RETA implementation. Any specific activity funded by this RETA will start in a \nparticular  member  country  only  after  ADB  has  received  a  no-objection  letter  from  its \ngovernment. \n \n16.  The program planning will require 24 person-months of international consulting and \n56 person-months  of  national  consulting  services.  The  international  consultants  will  be \nselected  and  hired  by  ADB,  and  the  national  consultants  by  WWF,  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). All procurement \nunder the RETA will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). Outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n \n17.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  the  provision  of  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis for program planning \nfor Strengthening Sound Environmental Management in the Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, \nMalaysia, and Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area. \n                                                 \n7  Application for cofinancing in the amount of $300,000 for project development will be made to the Global \nEnvironment Facility (GEF). Four GEF proposals will be prepared for HOB, SSME, forest management, the \ncarbon credit pilot project in West Papua, and regional climate change mitigation and adaptation. If approved, the \namount will be used to supplement the detailed study for specific GEF-eligible projects.  \n ", "6    Appendix 1   \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance  Data Sources/  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Targets/Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \n       \nStrengthened  \u2022 BIMP-EAGA meets the  \u2022 Periodic  \u2022 Agreements on \nsustainable management  performance targets  accomplishment  environmental \nof natural resources in  set in its action plan for  reports at the country  management are \nBIMP-EAGA.  sustainable natural  and BIMP-EAGA levels   finalized and \nresources    implemented by BIMP-\nmanagement by 2010   \u2022 Results of scientific  EAGA member \n  studies and research  countries, ASEAN, and \n\u2022 SSME program meets    development partners  \nthe performance  \u2022 Reports of NGOs   \ntargets set in its eco- working in BIMP-EAGA  Risks \nregional plan by 2013     \n  \u2022 Official reports  \u2022 Economic and other \n\u2022 HOB management  submitted to partner  development issues \nplan is developed and  international  take precedence over \nimplemented by 2013     organizations   environmental \n    concerns  \n\u2022 Strategies for  \u2022 BIMP governments do \nmobilizing resources  not promulgate \nfor the haze program  national policies or \nare developed and  allocate adequate \nimplemented by  2013  funds to support its \nsustainable \ndevelopment and \nenvironmental \nmanagement \ncomponent of its \nroadmap and action \nplan, and for SSME \nand HOB \nOutcome      Assumption \n       \nAgreed design of a  \u2022 Key stakeholders\u2019  \u2022 RETA reports   \u2022 Governments and key \nregional environment  groups in BIMP-EAGA  \u2022 Mission and project  stakeholders continue \nprogram for BIMP-EAGA   endorse the program  progress reports  supporting the BIMP-\nfor formal acceptance    EAGA road map and \nby the BIMP     action plan, SSME and \ngovernments by  HOB eco-regional plan, \nSeptember 2009  and ASEAN work \n   program for trans-\nboundary haze \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \n1.
