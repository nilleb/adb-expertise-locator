A summary of the initial environmental examination \nAssessment  that was undertaken is a core appendix. \n   \nProject Description  The PRC-Global Environment Facility (GEF) Partnership on Land \nDegradation  in  Dryland  Ecosystems  is  a  long-term  country \nprogramming  framework  (CPF)  that  was  approved  by  GEF\u2019s \ncouncil in October 2002. The CPF covers a 10-year period (2003\u2013\n2012) and seeks to combat land degradation, reduce poverty, and \nconserve biodiversity through capacity-building investments and \ndeveloping  viable  model  investment  projects  (consistent  with \nGEF\u2019s  Operational  Program  12  on  integrated  ecosystem \nmanagement). The investments envisaged in the 10\u2013year CPF \nare  estimated  at  about  $1.5 billion,  of  which  GEF  will  provide \n$150.0 million in grant assistance. The proposed Project is the \nfirst of an interventions series planned under the CPF, and the \nProject  aims  at  strengthening  the  enabling  environment  and \nbuilding  institutional  capacity  for  the  integrated  ecosystem \nmanagement of drylands in six priority provinces and/or nationally \nand  globally  significant  autonomous  regions  (Gansu,  Inner \nMongolia, Ningxia Hui, Qinghai, Shaanxi, and Xinjiang Uygur).  \n   \nRationale  The PRC's land area is 40% drylands. These drylands are home \nto over 100 million people and are extensively affected by land \ndegradation,  with  severe  economic,  social,  and  ecological \nconsequences, especially for the rural poor and ethnic minorities. \nDust storms, originating within the drylands, adversely impact the \nenvironment within and outside the country's borders. Intensive \nland use policies and practices are the primary cause of land \ndegradation.  The  Government  wants  to  address  this  problem \nthrough adopting an integrated ecosystem management approach \nthat is based on international and domestic best practices.  \n   \nObjectives  Project  objectives  are  to  help  the  Government  combat  land \ndegradation, reduce poverty, and conserve biodiversity through \nstrengthening  the  enabling  environment  and  developing \ninstitutional capacity.  \n   \nCost Estimates  The total project cost, including contingencies, taxes, and duties, \nis estimated at $13.8 million equivalent, comprising $2.1 million \n(about 15.2%) in foreign exchange and $11.7 million equivalent \n(about 84.8%) in local currency costs.  ", "iv \nFinancing Plan  GEF agreed to provide a $7.7 million grant to finance about 56.0% \nof the Project\u2019s cost. The Government will finance $6.1 million \nequivalent in local currency, or 44.0% of the total cost. The Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) will provide a $1.0 million associated \ntechnical assistance grant from the Technical Assistance Special \nFund  to  complement  GEF  and  government  financing.  The \nGovernment  will  also  contribute  $0.2  million  to  the  technical \nassistance in counterpart funds. \n   \nEstimated  1 July 2004 \nCommencement Date \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2008 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  The overall project implementation period is 4 years. A high-level \nArrangements  steering committee comprising representatives of 11 participating \nagencies and ADB has been functioning for the past 2 years to \nguide  the  design  phase  and  will  continue  to  guide  project \nimplementation. A central project coordination office was created \nin the Ministry of Finance and a project management office was \nestablished  in  the  State  Forestry  Administration.  Similar \ncoordination and management arrangements were created in the \nsix participating provinces and/or autonomous regions. \n   \nExecuting Agency  The State Forestry Administration \n   \nProcurement  The goods and services to be financed under the GEF grant will \nbe  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement under loan projects. The equipment and materials \nwill  be  procured  through  local  competitive  bidding  or  direct \npurchase. Minor items estimated to cost less than $100,000 may \nbe purchased locally. The equipment and materials financed from \nADB\u2019s technical assistance grant will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement for technical assistance \nprojects. \n   \nConsulting Services  International and domestic consultants will be required to assist in \nproject  implementation.  The  international  and  domestic \nconsultants required under the Project and associated technical \nassistance will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to \nADB  for  domestic  consultant  selection.  Consultants  financed \nunder  the  GEF  grant  will  be  selected  and  recruited  by  the \nGovernment,  following  the  procedures  used  for  ADB  loans. \nConsultants  financed  under  the  technical  assistance  will  be \nrecruited by ADB.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  Project benefits will accrue from an improved understanding of the \nBeneficiaries  root causes of land degradation and through the introduction of an \nintegrated  ecosystem  management  approach.  The  provinces \nand/or  regions  of  the  dry  and  impoverished  western  region ", "v \n(Gansu,  Inner  Mongolia,  Ningxia  Hui,  Qinghai,  Shaanxi,  and \nXinjiang Uygur), which have high incidences of unemployment \nand poverty, will benefit from the development of consistent legal \nand  regulatory  frameworks,  coordinated  strategic  planning \nmechanisms, participatory community planning processes at the \nlocal level, design capacity for land degradation interventions, and \neffective  land  degradation  monitoring  and  evaluation  systems. \nThese benefits will lead to longer term gains from investments \nunder the CPF that will affect the poor rural communities and \ndiverse  ethnic  minority  groups  that  are  most  affected  by  land \ndegradation.  National,  provincial,  and  county  governments  will \nbenefit through rationalizing budget expenditures for addressing \nland  and  natural  resource  degradation,  which  will  result  in \nimproved  efficiencies  in  resource  allocation.  Personnel  from \ngovernment agencies at national and local levels will benefit from \nthe  introduction  of  new  approaches  and  capacity-building \nactivities. The private sector will benefit from improved regulatory \nmeasures for investment and market-based services and policies \nprovision. More effective use of development partner support will \ncome  from  improved  development  partner  coordination  in \naddressing land and natural resource degradation. National and \nglobal benefits will accrue in (i) biodiversity conservation, given \nthat  many  threatened  ecosystems  and  species  of  global \nimportance  found  in  the  western  region  will  eventually  be \nprotected  and  conserved  through  adopting  an  integrated \necosystem management approach; (ii) transboundary dust storm \nreduction, given that these storms are expected to diminish in \nfrequency and severity over the longer term, due to improved \nmanagement  in  source  areas;  and  (iii)  agricultural  land \nmanagement  improvement,  given  that  this  will  occur  in  the \nwestern region and contribute to significant carbon capture by \n2012.  In  addition,  improved  grassland,  forest  and  woodland \nmanagement in the western region has the potential to capture 87 \nmillion tons of carbon by 2012. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The potential risks include slower than anticipated institutional and \npolicy  reform  pace  and  investment  project  development.  This \nwould  be  mitigated  under  the  Project  by  promoting  a  better \nunderstanding of the root causes of land degradation, upgrading \nthe existing legal and regulatory framework for land degradation, \nand  promoting  participatory  approaches.  The  principal \nassumptions  are  strong  government  ownership  and  political \ncommitment  to  achieving  a  more  efficient  and  cost-effective \napproach to combating land degradation under the forthcoming \nEleventh Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010). \n \nTechnical Assistance  ADB  will  provide  a  $1  million  technical  assistance  grant  to \ncomplement  project  interventions,  strengthen  interagency \ncoordination, and monitor and evaluate the Project and the CPF. \nThe technical assistance will be financed on a grant basis from \nADB\u2019s technical assistance funding program. ", " ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on the proposed \nadministration of a Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant to the Government of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) for the Capacity Building to Combat Land Degradation Project. Even \nthough  the  Project  will  be  financed  entirely  by  grant,  loan  processing  and  administration \nprocedures are applied because of the complex policy and implementation issues involved, the \nnecessity of Government ownership, the special organizational arrangements put in place by \nthe Government for implementation, and the degree of ADB supervision required. The report \nalso describes proposed technical assistance (TA) to support implementation of the Project. If \nthe Board approves the proposed administration of the GEF grant, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n  \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \n2.  The Government of the PRC requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 2000 to \ntake a lead role in facilitating the preparation of the PRC-GEF Partnership on Land Degradation \nin Dryland Ecosystems. To this end, ADB provided five TA projects between 2000 and 2003 to \ndevelop the Partnership at the central, provincial, and regional levels,1 resulting in a long-term \ncountry programming framework (CPF). This was the first such CPF, and it covers a 10-year \nperiod (2003\u20132012) and is described in a framework brief (Supplementary Appendix A) that was \napproved by the GEF council in October 2002. The CPF\u2019s primary focus is on six priority \nprovinces and/or nationally and globally significant autonomous regions in the PRC\u2019s western \nregion.  These  areas  include  Gansu,  Inner  Mongolia,  Ningxia  Hui,  Qinghai,  Shaanxi,  and \nXinjiang Uygur (see map). Investment projects under the CPF over 10 years are estimated at \n$1.5 billion.  \n \n3.  The CPF underpins a PRC-GEF agreement to commit resources to a phased set of \npriority activities over a 10-year period, to combat land degradation in the western region. The \nCPF is under GEF\u2019s Operational Program 12 (OP12), which involves integrated ecosystem \nmanagement,2 and the CPF covers (i) critical policy, legal, and regulatory instruments and the \ninstitutional reforms needed to strengthen the enabling environment; (ii) Biodiversity Action \nPlan,  Convention  to  Combat  Desertification-National  Action  Plan  (CCD-NAP),  Ministry  of \nAgriculture (MOA), Ministry of Land and Resources (MLR), Ministry of Water Resources (MWR), \n                                                 \n1\n ADB. 2000.

The GEF Secretariat approved pipeline entry and the Project \nDevelopment Facility\u2014Block B grant on 28 March 2001. \n2\n Integrated ecosystem management is a holistic approach to addressing the links between ecosystem functions and \nservices (such as carbon uptake and storage, climatic stabilization and watershed protection, and medicinal \nproducts) and human social, economic, and production systems (such as crop production, nomadic and sedentary \nlivestock raising, and infrastructure provision). This approach recognizes that people and the natural resources \nthey depend upon, directly or indirectly, such as land, water, and forests, are inextricably linked. Rather than treat \neach resource in isolation, integrated ecosystem management offers the option of treating all elements of \necosystems together to produce multiple benefits. This way of managing the environment has been incorporated \ninto a number of international conventions concerning environment and development, and international experience \nis beginning to demonstrate the benefits of this innovative approach.

As outlined in the Framework Brief, the Government will \ncontribute $700 million and mobilize an additional $615 million from development partners for \nbaseline activities. GEF will contribute $150 million in incremental financing for a series of GEF-\neligible projects.3 \n \n4.  The  proposed  Project  constitutes  an  essential  investment  that  will  strengthen  the \nenabling environment and build implementation capacity for the investment projects envisaged \nunder the CPF. A joint fact-finding mission was fielded in April and July 2003 to discuss with the \nagencies concerned and other development partners the Project\u2019s objective, scope, design, and \nimplementation arrangements. Project appraisal was undertaken in March 2004, to finalize the \nimplementation  and  financing  arrangements  at  the  central,  provincial,  and  local  levels.  As \nshown in appendixes 1 and 2, project development followed a participatory approach among all \nmajor stakeholders.4  \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n5.  Air, water, and land resource degradation threatens the life quality of the PRC\u2019s 1.30 \nbillion people. Land degradation is fundamentally the most difficult of all environmental issues to \naddress, and the PRC has many of the worst land degradation problems in the world, with over \n40% of its land area, 3.0\u20134.0 million square kilometers (km2), adversely affected.5 Reports from \nprovincial offices and Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) field ecological monitoring centers \nindicate that trends in land degradation due to wind erosion and salinization and desertification6 \nare increasing, with the expansion rate rising from around 1,500.0 km2 per year in the 1950s to \nnearly 3,500.0 km2 per year in the late 1990s.7 Over 30% of the PRC\u2019s 4 million km2 of \ngrasslands are estimated to suffer from moderate to severe degradation, while demands for \nmeat and other livestock products rise as urbanization and living standards increase. In arid \nareas, rapidly increasing livestock numbers exacerbate land degradation. The PRC\u2019s per capita \narable land, which is at 0.11 hectares, is relatively low by world averages, and water availability \n                                                 \n3\n  As set out in the Framework Brief, the 10-year CPF has three phases: Phase 1 (2003\u20132005), under the Tenth Five-\nYear Plan; Phase 2 (2006\u20132010), matching the entire period of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan; and Phase 3, the first \n2 years of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan (2011\u20132012). Under Phase 1, the indicative GEF investment grants are \nestimated at between $40.0 and $70.0 million. The World Bank-financed Gansu-Xinjiang Grasslands Development \nProject  ($10.5  million  GEF  grant)  was  approved  in  August  2003.  The  International  Fund  for  Agricultural \nDevelopment is expected to finance a poverty reduction project covering three provinces and/or regions, if this \nproject is approved in 2005. ADB prepared the project currently under consideration for a $7.7 million GEF grant. \nThese three projects, in aggregate, are anticipated to use at least $30 million in GEF grant funds.  \n4\n The Project first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in September 2003.  \n5\n  Land degradation, as used in this document, includes wind and water erosion; biomass loss in grasslands and \novergrazing; forest clearing; and related disturbances to the hydrological balance that result in erratic river flows, \nexcessive crop nutrient loss, soil fertility decline, poor soil drainage, and increased salt content.  \n6\n The Convention to Combat Desertification defines desertification as \u201cland degradation in arid, semi-arid, and dry \nsubhumid areas resulting from various factors, including climatic variations and human activities.\u201d The main factor \ncausing the advance of deserts is wind erosion, although the actual causes of desertification are numerous.  \n7\n Despite inconsistent national data, provincial data show that from the 1950s to the 1990s the annual land \ndegradation rate due to wind erosion and salinization and desertification increased from around 1,500 km2 to \nalmost 3,500 km2. The root causes are primarily human induced and are not the result of natural factors. ", "3 \nis only one quarter of the world average.8 Although the national data are inconsistent, ample \nevidence suggests that shrinking arable land area and increasing demand for higher agricultural \nincomes places pressure on farmers to extract higher yields from their land, at the expense of \nstable soil structure and adequate organic matter content, leading to increased soil erosion.9  \n \n6.  Land  degradation  is  accelerated  by  human  activities.  Degradation  was  particularly \naccelerated  in  the  PRC  over  the  past  50  years,  due  to  well-intentioned  policies  that  had \nnegative environmental consequences. Examples include (i) converting grasslands for cropping \nand  increased  livestock  grazing  in  marginal  areas,  especially  in  the  western  frontier;  (ii) \nrelocating people from more densely populated areas; (iii) developing industry on a large scale \nin remote and generally water-deficient parts of the country, which allowed factories unlimited \naccess to state-financed water supplies;10 (iv) expanding irrigated agriculture into some of the \ndriest parts of the country; and (v) keeping water prices low, thereby providing no incentive for \nfarmers to adopt water efficient techniques. Inappropriate land use practices and labor mobility \nrestrictions also had negative environmental impacts (appendixes 3 and 4). \n \n7.   Land  degradation\u2019s  social  and  economic  consequences  are  profound  and  include \nnotably lower household incomes and increased poverty in many rural communities, higher \nunemployment rates, and higher migration rates. These trends led to reduced agricultural and \npastoral lands productive capacity; damaged roads and other infrastructure; and lost watershed \nprotection functions, which resulted in increased productive land and reservoir sedimentation. \nDaily economic losses from land degradation are estimated at approximately $21.2 million \nequivalent. Of this, water erosion contributed about 64%, wind erosion 6%, and organic matter \nloss  and  salinization  30%.  Annual  soil  loss  is  estimated  at  5  billion  metric  tons.  Indirect \neconomic loss from land degradation, including public health effects, is estimated at over four \ntimes direct economic loss.11  \n \n  1.  Western Region and its Global Significance \n \n8.  The western region comprises 12 provinces and/or autonomous regions, many of which \nare similar in physical size and population to some Asian countries. In human development \nterms,  some  of  these  provinces  and/or  autonomous  regions  would  belong  to  the  least-\ndeveloped nations category.12 The western region supports a population of over 285 million, \nincluding many of the country\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable people.13 Low land productivity is \ncaused in part by fragile soils, water scarcity,14 and erratic rainfall patterns. Desertification is \n                                                 \n8\n World country averages per capita (2000) are 0.25 hectares for arable land and 8,000 cubic meters for renewable \nwater availability, respectively.  \n9\n ADB. 1991.

New York: Oxford University Press.  \n13\n Of the 592 key poverty counties designated by the State Council Leading Group Office of Poverty Alleviation and \nDevelopment in 2001, 375 are located in the western region. Absolute poverty (i.e., incomes below $0.67 per day) \nin the western region at the end of 2002 afflicted over 17.0 million people, or approximately 62% of the PRC\u2019s rural \npoor. Of these people, 6.8 million live in Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia Hui, Qinghai, Shaanxi, and Xinjiang \nUygur, the provinces and/or regions with the worst land degradation. On a $1.00 per day basis, approximately 19.0 \nmillion poor people are in these six provinces and/or regions, or 16% of their total population of 117.0 million.  \n14\n As an example, groundwater levels in Gansu Province are dropping by up to 1 meter per year. ", "4 \nconcentrated in the northern and northwestern regions, which lay in the arid, semiarid, and dry \nsubhumid zones. A high degree of overlap exists between ecologically sensitive areas and \npoverty  counties  in  western  PRC.15  Predominantly  rural,  these  areas  have  low  population \ndensities,  large  ethnic  minority  populations,  high  reliance  on  grazing  and  agriculture,  high \npoverty incidence, huge mineral deposits, and very arid and fragile environments. Western PRC \ndevelopment is severely constrained by the area\u2019s massive territorial expanse, long distances \nbetween population centers and eastern markets, poor economic and social infrastructure, and \nlow institutional capacity (below that of more advanced coastal areas). \n \n9.  The PRC has more of the world\u2019s known biodiversity than nearly all other countries and \na higher proportion of endemic species. The PRC\u2019s biodiversity ranking places the nation in the \nworld\u2019s top three. The PRC claims 30,000 seed plants species, 6,300 vertebrate species, and \n3,862 fish species.16 While the western region has fewer species than the rest of the country, its \nendemic species richness is higher than elsewhere and is associated with a high degree of \nextinction  threat.  Many  plant  and  animal  species  are  ancient  or  are  becoming  rare.  They \ntherefore have enormous scientific and commercial value. These species are used for tourism, \npharmaceuticals,  or  construction  materials.  About  700  endemic  plant  species  (16%  of  all \nspecies in the PRC) and 199 endemic vertebrate species (28% of all species in the PRC) are \ncurrently recorded. Desert endemicity, at 16\u201323%, is much higher than in most other parts of \nthe PRC (2\u201314%). The six most degraded areas, Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia Hui, Qinghai, \nShaanxi, and Xinjiang Uygur, have more than 5,000 recorded plant and animal species, which is \nless than one tenth of the rest of the PRC (less than 50,000 species, not including lower plants \nand  invertebrates,  fungi,  bacteria,  and  actinomycetes),  but  have  a  higher  percentage  of \nendemics that are endangered in their range. The Qingzang Plateau, ecologically known as the \nlast intact kingdom of animals in the world, has 43.7% of the PRC\u2019s terrestrial vertebrates and \n40.0% of vascular plants (Appendix 4). \n \n10.  Dust  storms  and  sandstorms  are  of  national  and  global  significance  in  relation  to \natmospheric conditions and were recorded for at least 1,000 years in the PRC and northeast \nAsia. Dust storms and sandstorms also increased from an average of 0.5 per year in the 1950s \nto 2.3 per year throughout the 1990s and increased in their severity. An average annual direct \nfinancial loss of $157 million equivalent was estimated for the 1990s. Degraded grasslands, \nfarmed areas with no vegetative cover at critical times of the year, and saltpans on the edges of \ndry saline lakes are the sources of dust storms in northwest and north PRC. The impact is felt in \nthe PRC, Korea, and Japan.17 Dust from the PRC was identified along the west coast of the \nUnited States. Six provinces and/or autonomous regions (Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia Hui, \nQinghai, Shaanxi, and Xinjiang Uygur) have 97% of the wind-eroded land and desert. These \nareas are the source of dust storm activity originating in northern PRC, and they have 54% of \nwater-eroded areas. Promoting sustainable resources management, establishing vegetation on \ndegraded land, and promoting minimum tillage systems will reduce dust storms and improve \natmospheric conditions through carbon capture above and below the earth.18  \n \n                                                 \n15\n Voegele, J. 2001.

The Government recognizes that a major effort is needed to combat land degradation as \na national development priority. The Government\u2019s commitment to sustainable natural resource \nmanagement  is  reflected  in  the  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005).  This  plan  calls  for  (i) \nattaching importance to the sustainable use of water resources; (ii) protecting land, forest, \ngrassland, marine, and mineral resources; and (iii) improving environmental quality in rural and \nurban  areas.  In  June  1999,  the  Government  officially  launched  the  Western  Development \nStrategy (WDS), which has two main objectives: (i) reduce economic disparities between the \nwestern  and  other  regions  and  (ii)  ensure  sustainable  natural  resource  management.  Key \ngovernment plans and programs include the following:  \n \n(i)  National Plan for Ecological Environment Construction (1998\u20132050). This plan \ncoordinates water and soil conservation with national economic development. The \nplan also aims to improve living standards and prevent water and soil loss. \n(ii)  Natural  Forest  Protection  Program.  Under  this  program,  industrial  logging  in \nnatural forests was banned (beginning in 1998) in most PRC areas. The program \napplies to all forests in the western region and is the largest nationally funded forest \nconservation program. \n(iii)  National Land Conversion Program (2000\u20132008). This program aims to reverse \nvegetation degradation and soil erosion by converting steep lands that are cultivated \nor barren into forest, shrub, or grassland cover. \n(iv)  Small Watershed Program of the Ministry of Water Resources. This program will \nimprove technical management of small- and modest-sized watersheds. \n(v)  Desertification prevention and control programs. These programs include three \nnorth  shelterbelt  system  programs,  Plain  Farmland  Shelterbelt  System  Program, \nTaihang Mountain Afforestation Program, and National Program for Prevention and \nControl of Desertification. Shelterbelt forests in the middle and lower reaches of the \nYangtze  and  Yellow  rivers  and  Taihu  lake  catchments  will  also  be  affected  by \nprevention and control programs.  \n(vi)  CCD-NAP.19  This  program  focuses  on  265  priority  counties  in  western  PRC. \nImplementation is over three phases: 2001\u20132010, 2011\u20132030, and 2031\u20132050. A \nkey objective of CCD-NAP in its first phase is to control 22 million hectares of \ndegraded land by 2010. An investment programs blue book, submitted in 2000 by \nprovincial authorities to the Chinese Committee for Implementation of the Convention \nto Combat Desertification (CCICCD) for consideration and support by prospective \ndevelopment partners, lists 24 projects covering priority areas, with a total budget of \n$1.26 billion. None of these projects attracted development partner financing, as they \nwere seen as too traditionally forestry oriented. \n(vii)  Biodiversity Conservation Action Plan. This plan was formulated in response to \nthe Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the Country Study Report on \nBiodiversity in China, which carried out comprehensive assessments of biodiversity, \nindexed  endangered  animals  and  plants,  and  put  forward  policy  suggestions \nregarding the strengthening of national capacity for biodiversity protection and the \nsustainable use of biological resources. \n(viii)  National Wetlands Conservation Action Plan. To enforce the Ramsar Convention \non Wetlands, this plan covers the designation of important wetlands as national \nreserves. \n                                                 \n19\n CCICCD.

During the 1990s, total public investment in land degradation programs almost tripled, to \nover CNY54 billion.20 Government expenditures in the six most degraded dryland areas (Gansu, \nInner Mongolia, Ningxia Hui, Qinghai, Shaanxi, and Xinjiang Uygur) in 2002 were approximately \nequivalent to $1 billion, almost twice the 2000 level. Despite this growth in expenditure, the \nGovernment is concerned about inefficiency and an uncoordinated approach to tackling cross-\nsector issues. Plans and programs are mostly designed and implemented by sector agencies \nworking in isolation and with a top-down perspective, and, with few exceptions, these efforts \nachieved less than intended. Forestry programs dominate expenditures. From 2000 to 2010, \napproximately $66 billion equivalent is projected to be spent on these programs.21 A new \nforestry development strategy was issued in September 2003, and this gave greater attention to \nenvironment protection and even higher expenditure targets.22 At the March 2004 National \nPeople\u2019s Congress, renewed emphasis was placed on rural development and environment \nprotection.  \n \n13.  Increased  government  awareness  and  commitment  to  addressing  environmental \nchallenges drew support from the international community, which is keenly aware of the global \nimplications of the PRC\u2019s size and potential.23 The PRC-GEF Partnership features prominently \nin the country strategy and program (2004\u20132006), and ADB organized regular development \npartner coordination roundtables.24 Development partner grant value under the ninth and tenth \nfive-year development plans is estimated to be $100 million, whereas loan-funded projects \nunder these plans are estimated to be $50 million\u2013100 million. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n14.  From dialogue with involved agencies over the past 3 years, the main problems and \nopportunities  related  to  promoting  integrated  ecosystem  management  approaches  and \ncombating land degradation were identified. A problems analysis is given in Appendix 3. The \nproposed project that is described in Section III will make a start toward a long-term solution to \novercoming these problems. \n \n                                                 \n20\n ADB. 2002.

The new strategy combines ongoing projects with new initiatives and gives more \nattention to sustainable ecological systems. In addition, the strategy advocates less reliance on fast-growing \nspecies and a projected total expenditure of $96.9 billion equivalent in the 7 years to 2010. On this basis, annual \nexpenditures will be $13.8 billion equivalent and reach that level much faster than those previously announced. \n23\n The PRC currently feeds 22.0% of the world\u2019s population, based on only 6.4% of the world\u2019s land area, 7.2% of the \nworld\u2019s farmland, and 5.8% of the world\u2019s annual water resources. \n24\n Participating organizations include the Australian Agency for International Development; Canadian International \nDevelopment  Agency;  Department  for  International  Development;  European  Union;  Food  and  Agriculture \nOrganization;  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit;  International  Fund  for  Agricultural \nDevelopment; Japan Bank for International Cooperation; Japan International Cooperation Agency; Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr \nWiederaufbau; United Nations Development Programme; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \nOrganization; World Bank; and embassies of Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and United States. At these \nmeetings, participants expressed strong support for improved aid agency coordination to combat land degradation. \nADB will provide support to the office and continue to support aid agency coordination in collaboration with the \nUnited Nations Development Programme. The Global Mechanism of United Nations Convention to Combat \nDesertification agreed to provide full support in mobilizing resources from bilateral, multilateral, and private sector \norganizations for the Partnership. Appendix 5 (Table A5) provides a list of some international development agency-\nsupported land degradation projects. See Supplementary Appendix C for details. ", "7 \n1.  Technical and Institutional Problems \n \n15.  While many institutions are involved in collecting national-level data on different land \ndegradation  types,  no  single  agency  collects  all  data  required  for  a  comprehensive \nunderstanding  of  land  degradation  processes.25  Different  agencies  use  different  land \ndegradation definitions or focus on certain aspects. A coordinated approach, using standard \nprocedures to obtain information on trends in land degradation, is needed. This approach will \nallow decision making to be based on accurate and universally acceptable data. Technical \nresearch on combating land degradation was completed over the last 50 years, and some \nsuccessful  applications  were  developed  (e.g.,  desert  sand  stabilization,  to  protect  major \ntransport  links).  However,  little  research  was  conducted  to  (i)  understand  root  causes;  (ii) \nmeasure existing approach impacts and cost-benefit ratios; (iii) design new and cost-effective \napproaches; or (iv) gather and analyze policy-relevant data for planning.   \n \n2.  Incomplete Policy and Legislative Framework \n \n16.  Within the PRC\u2019s current wide range of policy and legislation, a substantial variability \nexists in the PRC\u2019s ability to recognize many different types of land degradation. Also, only a \nvariable ability exists to implement the variety of programs needed for land degradation control. \nIn recent years, the PRC recognized the benefits of taking a sustainable development approach, \nand natural resource and environmental law reform commenced.26 Considerable effort will be \nneeded  to  remove  the  gaps  and  overlaps  in  existing  environmental  policies,  laws,  and \nregulations at the central and provincial or regional levels. Local-level regulations are also not \nunderstood fully or enforced, land tenure arrangements are often uncertain, and land use rights \nfor rural communities require further reform to promote a long-term perspective on natural \nresource use. Improving sustainable management policy and legislation quality and consistency \nare major challenges that the Government is focused on for the future.27 \n \n3.  Limited Role of Markets \n \n17.  Despite some reforms, market-based services and incentives are inadequate to support \nsustainable resource use, and the private sector role is generally undeveloped. Rural financial \nmarkets are undeveloped, and most rural households do not have access to efficient or effective \nfinancial services. Although water tariffs now better reflect real cost, groundwater is still not \npriced at a level that enables depletion cost recovery.28 Likewise, fees for communal land lease \ncontracts do not generally reflect real land value and therefore encourage high input-low output \nland  use  approaches.  Due  to  past  severe  food  shortages,  traditional  production-oriented \napproaches  resulted  in  a  number  of  so-called  perverse  incentives  that  impinge  directly  or \nindirectly on land degradation. As the PRC is now a self-sufficient food producer, supply-driven \n                                                 \n25\n Notably, SFA monitors desertification and forest cover; MWR monitors soil erosion and water resource quality and \nquantity; MOA monitors soil fertility and grassland quality; SEPA monitors ecological changes and biodiversity; \nMinistry of Land and Resources monitors changes in land use and land conversion; China Meteorological \nAdministration monitors climate change and dust storms; and State Bureau for Surveying and Mapping monitors \nspatial data on infrastructure development. \n26\n The process commenced in 1998 with the amendment of the Forestry Law and the Land Administration Law. Other \nmajor natural resource laws (water, grasslands, and agriculture) were revised in 2002, and other key legislation \nwas introduced (e.g., environmental impact assessment, antidesertification). \n27\n The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and ADB and other aid organizations are assisting the PRC \nin improving its environmental law quality, based on best international practices. \n28\n Such distortions encourage extending irrigated areas into unsuitable environments, increasing salinization, and \nsupporting an increasing livestock population, because of the availability of fodder. ", "8 \nproduction no longer needs to dominate development thinking. Private sector involvement can \nbe increased in many ways. 29  \n \n4.  Institutional Fragmentation \n \n18.  Ecosystem  elements  are  currently  treated  in  isolation  from  each  other,  based  on \ninstitutional mandates. And, as a result, no strong understanding exists of area-wide ecological \nsystems and how to address these in a coordinated and systematic way. For example, water is \ntreated differently depending on whether it is managed for livestock needs, irrigated agriculture, \nforestry purposes, or domestic consumption. Likewise, different agencies deal with soil erosion, \ndepending on whether it is induced by water (MWR) or wind (SFA). This creates problems, \nbecause  most  ecosystems  suffer  from  a  combination  of  water-induced  and  wind-induced \nerosion. The agency responsible for desertification (SFA) is not responsible for the management \nof  grasslands  (MOA),  despite  the  fact  that  grassland  degradation  is  the  major  cause  of \ndesertification. The result is poor institutional coordination and no clear authority and control \nover  natural  resources,  which  leads  to  only  limited  impacts  on  environmental  and  poverty \nobjectives. A high-level coordination mechanism is needed for an integrated central-, provincial-, \nor regional-level approach to land degradation control under the forthcoming Eleventh Five-Year \nPlan  (2006\u20132010).  Although  government  programs  relied  on  sector-specific  approaches  to \nnatural  resource  management,  international  experience  from  countries  such  as  Australia, \nCanada, United States, and others strongly supports an integrated ecosystem management-\nstyle approach.30  \n \n5.  Inconsistency Between Sector Approach and Area Planning \n \n19.  Land degradation control and ecosystem rehabilitation to date have emphasized top-\ndown  engineering  solutions  (i.e.,  ecological  construction)  on  a  sector  basis  (e.g.,  forestry, \nagriculture, and water resources). This approach typically has not involved extensive affected \npopulation participation or attacked the root causes of land and ecosystem degradation, as \nthese relate to addressing poverty and providing alternatives to unsustainable land practices. \nAdopting  a  comprehensive  framework,  including  public  awareness  programs,  social  and \neconomic infrastructure, and sustainable livelihood promotion, is needed. Locality-specific land \nuse planning remains poorly developed. Devolving responsibility for restoring degraded lands to \nthe local level needs to be based upon (i) common understanding of integrated ecosystem \nmanagement principles; (ii) bottom-up community participation; and (iii) appropriate land use \nplanning  tools  and/or  mechanisms  that  have  the  potential  to  be  promoted  at  county  and \ntownship levels in the Eleventh Five-Year Plan. A growing body of successful experience exists \nin  the  PRC  with  community-based  participatory  planning  processes  for  rural  development \nproject design and implementation, often at the watershed or ecosystem level. At least 30 \n                                                 \n29 \nADB. 2002. Technical Assistance for National Strategies for Soil and Water Conservation. Manila. Examples \ninclude (i) rural enterprises using conservation farm and/or forest management practices; (ii) ecotourism and \nconservation-related businesses that are based on the region\u2019s rich biodiversity; (iii) sustainable financial systems \nthat provide effective services to rural areas; (iv) offsite (downstream) beneficiary fees that pay for onsite \n(upstream) conservation (e.g., a levy on water user fees or hydroelectricity bills); (v) land degradation control that is \nfunded from the development, operation, and maintenance costs of major infrastructure development projects \ninvolving roads, railways, dams, water transmission canals, irrigation facilities, hydropower plants, oil and gas \npipelines, water systems (urban), etc., as erosion, sedimentation, flooding, or burial by drifting sand and/or \nlandslides may threaten their long-term viability; and (vi) river basin or provincial level trust fund creation, financed \nthrough levies on offsite and/or downstream beneficiaries, to support land degradation control as part of the public \ncontribution to the costs of upstream conservation.  \n30\n Yang, Youlin, Victor Squires, and Lu Qi, eds. 2001. Global Alarm: Dust and Sandstorms from the World\u2019s Drylands. \nNew York: United Nations.  ", "9 \nprojects were identified; a common factor was international development agency support, where \na  participatory  approach  was  required  (Appendix  5).  However,  this  approach  is  not  yet \nmainstreamed into government programs or projects.  \n \n6.  Inadequate Budget Resources and Financial Incentives at the Local Level \n \n20.  Although government expenditures increased and investment mechanisms evolved as a \nresult of the WDS, the counties most seriously affected by land degradation are the poorest, \nand they have low revenue bases. Local financial capacity to carry out locally planned, financed, \nand implemented investments is therefore weak. The financial capacity of the most degraded \ndryland  provinces  and/or  regions  to  seek  long-term  financing  from  multilateral  financial \norganizations and related grant cofinancing is also constrained by current policies that require \nlocal-level debt servicing. Debt financing is, logically, reserved for investments with adequate \nfinancial  returns  (such  as  infrastructure)  and  not  public-good  investments,  such  as  land \ndegradation control. While larger fiscal transfers from the central Government are vital, financial \nreforms and mechanisms are also needed. An improved development agency coordination \nmechanism  would  help  maximize  concession  financing.  Most  grants  come  from  bilateral \nagencies  (coordinated  by  the  Ministry  of  Commerce),  whereas  multilateral  borrowing  is \ncontrolled by the Ministry of Finance (MOF). Local planning and budgeting systems also need \nimproved  expenditure  prioritization  and  efficiency.  Financial  incentives  for  provinces  and/or \nregions  to  promote  an  integrated  ecosystem  management  approach  to  combating  land \ndegradation are also needed. \n \nC.  Key Lessons Learned \n \n21.  From  the  Framework  Brief  and  subsequent  dialogue,  consensus  exists  concerning \ninternational experience providing many lessons relevant to the PRC. In addition, the PRC\u2019s, \nADB\u2019s, and other development agencies\u2019 experiences (Appendix 5) throughout the region are \nrelevant. In brief, the main lessons learned include the following:    \n \n(i)  Using best international practices. International experience (e.g., acquired in \nAustralia, Canada, and United States) teaches that interagency coordination is \nvital, as controlling land degradation requires a multidimensional approach with a \nlong-term  perspective.  Comprehensive,  scientific,  and  participatory  approaches \nyielded  excellent  and  long-term  results  in  economic  productivity  and  restored \nenvironmental quality in very large areas of previously degraded drylands. The \nhigh-level coordination arrangement that has operated for the past 3 years, with \nsimilar arrangements in each province and region, will guide CPF implementation \nat central, provincial, and regional levels. The Project will build the capacity to \nimplement  the  10-year  CPF;  facilitate  future  investment  projects;  and  improve \ndevelopment agency coordination, which will increase concessional funding.  \n(ii)  Creating  an  enabling  environment.  Improving  the  quality  of  environmental \npolicies, laws, and regulations, as will be done under the Project\u2019s first component, \nwill  assist  in  providing  a  more  consistent  and  comprehensive  provincial-level \nframework. Land tenure arrangements, land use rights, and market-based services \nand incentives that will support a wider private sector role are also supported, to \npromote a long-term perspective on natural resource exploitation. \n(iii)  Treating land degradation\u2019s causes. Land degradation\u2019s root causes, and not \njust its symptoms, must be properly diagnosed and widely understood if treatments \nare to be designed that are effective and acceptable to rural people. Standard \ndefinitions, procedures, and indicators are needed to obtain and report information ", "10 \non land degradation trends. Bottom-up processes, not top-down processes, are \nmost effective at the ecosystem level, and they are likely to be more sustainable in \nthe long term.31 Farmers, herders, and researchers, as well as decision makers, all \nneed to frankly exchange views. Devolving implementation responsibility to the \nlocal level and greater stakeholder participation in decision making are needed. \nGreater fiscal transfers to the lower levels of government and incentives to promote \nsustainable development are required. The Project includes participatory surveys, \nfield  demonstrations  of  integrated  ecosystem  management,  project  impact \nevaluations,  applied  research  grants,  economic  research,  land  degradation \nstrategy development, land degradation monitoring and evaluation system reform, \nand training and institutional capacity building at central and provincial levels. \n(iv)  Implementing  flexible  and  responsive  interventions.  Previous  ADB  TA \nactivities show that clear targets; regular reviews; flexible approaches; and short \ntime frames, to maintain momentum, must accompany future efforts to assist the \nGovernment in this complex area.32 These features were incorporated into project \ndesign. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objectives \n \n22.  The  CPF\u2019s  overall  goal  (as  set  out  in  the  Framework  Brief)  is  to  combat  land \ndegradation, alleviate poverty, and restore dryland ecosystems in the western region. The \nproject objectives under the CPF are to strengthen the enabling enabling environment and \ndevelop institutional capacity to combat land degradation (Appendix 1). The Project will work at \nthe central level and in the six priority provinces and/or autonomous regions (Gansu, Inner \nMongolia, Ningxia Hui, Qinghai, Shaanxi, and Xinjiang Uygur) that are most affected by dryland \ndegradation. Each provincial government indicated high-level political support for the reforms \nneeded  in  the  enabling  conditions  (existing  policies,  legislative  framework,  institutional \narrangements,  harmonized  plans,  and  budget  allocation)  that  are  essential  for  sustained \nprogress in arresting land degradation.  \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n23.  The Project will comprise six components and their supporting activities, determined in \ndiscussion with the Government and other stakeholders. In addition to policy and institutional \nreforms, the Project will focus on assisting the Government in developing an integrated program \nto  address  land  degradation  through  an  integrated  ecosystem  management  approach.  \nAppendix 6 provides a component summary. Supplementary Appendixes D to I provide the full \ncomponent details. \n                                                 \n31\n The successful Fujian Soil Conservation and Rural Development Project also provides practical lessons.

For instance, the \ncompletion report for PRC-GEF Partnership on Land Degradation in Dryland Ecosystems (TCR 3657-PRC) \nconcluded that the TA was partly successful. The lessons learned from this TA include that \u201cIt is extremely difficult \nfor  any  sector  agency  to  coordinate  other  sector  agencies  in  a  multi-sector  approach  to  combating  land \ndegradation. It [the difficulty in coordinating] amply illustrated that institutional problems are the main barrier to be \novercome. Government has noted this and has taken positive steps toward strengthening interagency coordination \nand full-time management of the CPF.\u201d  ", "11 \n  1.  Improving  Policies, Laws, and Regulations for Land Degradation Control \n \n24.  Component 1 will support quality improvements in existing policies, laws, regulations, \nand procedures, including incentives for combating land degradation, especially at the provincial \nlevel. Three broad outcomes will be pursued, as summarized in paras. 25\u201327.33 \n \n25.  Developing Procedures and Mechanisms to Improve Law and Policy Quality and \nImplement Integrated Ecosystem Management. Six related work areas will assess, develop, \nand recommend (i) a comprehensive legislative and ecological elements toolbox for legal, \npolicy, and institutional arrangements for land degradation management, including the toolbox\u2019s \ncomputerization;34 and (ii) standard provincial procedures based on best practices covering \norganizations,  land  management,  community  participation,  financing  arrangements,  and \nregulatory  and  nonregulatory  approaches  enforcement;  (iii)  laws,  regulations,  and  policies \nharmonization,  covering  grasslands  and  desertification;  water  and  soil  conservation;  water, \nforestry,  agriculture,  and  land  administration;  environmental  protection;  and  environmental \nimpact  assessment  (EIA);  (iv)  capacity  building  for  laws  and  policies  implementation  and \nsurveillance,  focusing  on  developing  an  interagency  coordination  mechanism  for  decision \nmaking applicable to the Eleventh Five-Year Plan in each province and region; procedures for \necosystem  function  zones,  to  be  integrated  with  other  zones  used  in  different  sectors; \nprocedures  for  implementation  under  the  EIA  law;  and  one  mechanism  to  examine \nimplementation and monitoring effectiveness; (v) EIA\u2019s role in land degradation control through \npractical procedures under the EIA law; and (vi) legal procedures for private sector involvement, \nincluding  land  tenure;  land  use  rights;  gender  rights  and  market  access;  compensation \nmeasures for grassland closure; and preparation of measures to address sustainable livelihoods \nin consideration of poverty alleviation, minority groups, and gender rights. \n \n26.  Building Capacity in Legislative and Policy Aspects. Three linked work areas will be \nundertaken: (i) preparing a comprehensive capacity-building program in legislative, policy, and \ninstitutional measures to train key target groups, including legal officers, legal draftsmen, judicial \nofficials, policy makers, government officials, and private individuals at the central, provincial, \nand regional levels; (ii) implementing training workshops at central and provincial levels on \nintegrated ecosystem management\u2019s legal role, land degradation studies\u2019 legal aspects, policy \nand law links establishment, EIA, and judicial and legislative remedies access. Workshops \nwould be provided through a PRC institution with a recognized capacity and include training of \ntrainers and include relevant materials and presentations preparation;35 and (iii) supporting a \nprogram of international visits, tours, and secondments for selected officials that will focus on \ninnovative and relevant environmental laws and policies.  \n \n27.  Policy, Advice, and Problem Solving Support. A legal and policy advisory group will \nbe formed, comprising representatives of all involved provinces and/or regions and the central \nGovernment  to  guide  implementation,  including  field  visits  and  monitoring.  In  addition,  a \nfeasibility study will be undertaken. This study will examine the need for a permanent capacity \n                                                 \n33\n Component 1\u2019s design and implementation arrangements reflect a systematic approach and the recommendations \nmade in ADB. 2002. Capacity Building for Environmental Law in Asia and the Pacific Region. Manila. \n34\n This will be a joint central and provincial exercise that is based on current land degradation problems, and it will be \ntested and implemented at the provincial level. The toolbox will act as a compendium of existing laws, regulations, \nand measures for implementation  with an explanation of their capacity to implement integrated ecosystem \nmanagement. Moreover, the toolbox will include recommendations to deal with land degradation. \n35\n For example, Research Institute of Environmental Law at Wuhan University, or Beijing Normal University. ", "12 \nfor environmental law training in dryland areas and identify the most cost-effective option for \ndelivering such training. Last, special studies will be undertaken to assist with legal reform.36  \n \n2.  Strengthening National and Provincial Coordination \n \n28.  This component will ensure that the forthcoming Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010) \nreflects greater sector plan harmonization and introduces integrated ecosystem management \napproaches and budget allocation rationalization in the involved provinces and/or regions. To \nhighlight  the  principles  of  integrated  ecosystem  management  and  promote  mutual \nunderstanding among stakeholders of the concepts, key problems, and root causes of land \ndegradation, an international workshop will be held in the first year of implementation. The \nworkshop will (i) aim to assist policy makers as they work to better understand land degradation \ncauses in the PRC and overseas and help them understand what worked, what did not work, \nand why; (ii) involve all key stakeholders and help identify their views of proposed interventions \nand phasing; and (iii) assist in developing advice concerning specific and regional guidelines for \nthe Eleventh Five-Year Plan, which will be issued in September 2005.37  \n \n29.  An institutions and planning expert group will be formed, comprising representatives of \nall involved agencies. The group will guide the implementation of components 2, 3, 4, and 6. For \ncomponent 2, the group will assist in undertaking an institutional review and recommending \nappropriate measures, including a mechanism for improved central, provincial, and regional \ninteragency  collaboration  and  coordination.  Other  activities  will  include  (i)  formulating  land \ndegradation strategies at the province or region level; (ii) assessing the economic costs and \nbenefits of land degradation control through field studies in selected areas; (iii) implementing a \nfeasibility study examining the establishment of integrated ecosystem management training on a \npermanent basis; (iv) revisiting CCD-NAP, Biodiversity Action Plan, and other relevant action \nplans, to harmonize the approach being taken under the PRC-GEF Partnership; (v) initiating \nworkshops to promote strategic integrated ecosystem management planning; and (vi) promoting \nregional and interprovincial study tours and exchanges on integrated ecosystem management.  \n \n3.  Improving  Operational  Arrangements  at  Provincial/Autonomous  Region \nand County Levels \n \n30.  Component 3 will enhance provincial and county agencies\u2019 capacity to work with rural \ncommunities in bottom-up participatory planning and implementing field-level land degradation \ncontrol through an integrated ecosystem management approach. Under institution and planning \nexpert group guidance, other activities will include assessing existing operational arrangements, \ninstitutional  capacity,  and  training  needs;  identifying  field-level  best  practices;  developing \nintegrated  ecosystem  management  guidelines,  manuals,  and  materials  for  training;  and \ndemonstrating community-based land degradation control in a minimum of three selected areas \nper province or region. A minimum of 10 adaptive research grants will also be provided, on a \ncompetitive basis, for research agencies to conduct participatory research and use participatory \ntechnologies in combating land degradation. A public awareness campaign on the integrated \necosystem management approach will be undertaken, and workshops on community-based \nland  degradation  control,  tours  and/or  exchanges  for  study,  and  publications  will  also  be \nsupported. \n \n                                                 \n36\n For example, including the Wild Animal Protection Law, Land Administration Law, and various regulations relating \nto the Desertification Prevention and Control Law, and Grasslands Law. \n37\n The planning guidelines are recommended by NDRC to the State Council. ", "13 \n4.  Capacity Development for Land Degradation Investment Projects  \n \n31.  Developing the capacity to design, implement, and finance future investment projects, \nbased on an integrated ecosystem management approach to combat land degradation, is a \nmajor element of the Project. In each province and region, the approach will (i) identify training \nneeds; (ii) examine the impact of past land degradation investments (accurate feedback on the \nimpacts, benefits, and efficiencies of different types of interventions, as could come via a \ncoordinated  monitoring  and  evaluation  program,  are  not  available);38  and  (iii)  undertake \nfeasibility studies of integrated ecosystem management project investments. These studies will \ncover high-priority investment projects, for possible ADB, GEF, or other development agency \nfinancing under the PRC-GEF Partnership.39 To identify potential financing for these future \ninvestments, a study of cofinancing options will be undertaken to identify one or more modalities \nfor  combining  loan  financing,  GEF  grants,  other  concessional  resources,  and  government \nsupport. An operational cofinancing modality is a precondition for each province and region to \nbenefit from potential investments under the Partnership.  \n \n5.  Monitoring and Evaluation System for Land Degradation \n \n32.  The  component\u2019s  major  outputs  will  be  (i)  a  national  coordination  mechanism  for \ncollecting,  sharing,  and  analyzing  land  degradation-related  data;  (ii)  the  clarification  of \nprovincial- and county-level agency roles and mechanisms that will contribute to national-level \nland degradation assessments; (iii) a universally agreed definition of land degradation, including \ncommon definitions of specific land degradation types (e.g., wind erosion, water erosion, soil \nfertility  decline,  and  biodiversity  loss);  common  standards  and  indicators  for  national-level \nmonitoring  of  specific  land  degradation  types;  and  compatible  software  programs  and \nstandards, which will facilitate sharing of data sets.  \n \n33.  Activities  will  be  guided  by  an  advisory  group  on  land  degradation  monitoring  and \nevaluation.  The  group  will  comprise  experts  from  established  participating  main  agencies. \nActivities will include establishing a geographic information system at each province and region; \ntraining in land degradation assessment; developing indicators for monitoring land degradation; \nand conducting related workshops, study tours, and exchange visits. At the national, provincial, \nand regional levels, a series of institutional stakeholder consultation and consensus building \nmeetings would be held to reach agreement on new mechanisms for coordinating and sharing \nthe collection and analysis of national-level land degradation datasets. At the community level, \nthe  direct  stakeholders  (land  users,  including  farmers,  foresters,  herders,  etc.)  would  be \ninvolved in pilot monitoring and assessment studies, participating actively in assessing the \nnature, severity, and impact of land degradation in their areas. Proven programs and techniques \nfor assessing and monitoring land degradation in the PRC will be supported, including the Food \nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and its successful Land Degradation \nAssessment in Drylands (LADA) pilot program.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n38\n Shaanxi Province provided a list of 21 major land degradation projects, including foreign assisted projects. The \nprovince has no overview of the impact of these or other ongoing projects, nor does it have a view on the \nreplicability of possible best practice results coming from foreign assisted projects. Provincial leaders stated that \nthey would welcome a comparative impact evaluation of these projects as a guide to formulating future investments \nunder the Eleventh Five-Year Plan. \n39\n ADB programmed several project preparation TAs and subsequent loans for OP12 investments in 2004\u20132006. The \nagreed project eligibility criteria (in addition to existing GEF principles and criteria) are given in Appendix 4. ", "14 \n6.  Implementation Arrangements for the Country Programming Framework \n \n34.  Capacity will be developed to support the 10\u2013year CPF\u2019s implementation, including \nfuture  integrated  ecosystem  management  projects  and  development  partner  coordination. \nLogistical and technical support will be provided for the already established project coordination \noffice (PCO) in MOF and the project management office (PMO) in SFA. The PCO and PMO will \nshare a common office in Beijing. The office was opened in November 2003. Information \nexchange between projects, agencies, and other stakeholders will be a major activity to promote \nunderstanding  of  lessons  learned,  promote  understanding  of  integrated  ecosystem \nmanagement\u2019s role, and improve cooperation and transparency. A program monitoring and \nevaluation system based on learning and adaptive management is being established in MOF. \nThe system will ensure that project results and results of related projects are used to adjust the \nprogram.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n35.  Support for the Long-Term Country Programming Framework. The Project is the \nfirst  step  toward  a  long-term  PRC-GEF  Partnership  on  Land  Degradation  in  Dryland \nEcosystems,  providing  vital  preliminary  measures  in  support  of  future  demonstration \ninvestments in integrated ecosystem management models for combating land degradation.  \n \n36.  Multiple Agencies and Provinces and/or Regions. Eleven government agencies and \nsix provinces and/or regions are involved in the Project. High-level coordination and consultation \nwithin the Government, backed up by high-level political support, is a preparatory phase feature \nand will continue into implementation.  \n \n37.  Institutional  Reform.  Mechanisms  are  proposed  for  (i)  high-level  institutional \ncoordination for ensuring an integrated approach centrally and at the provincial and regional \nlevels for land degradation control; (ii) improved coordination between MOF and Ministry of \nCommerce to maximize concessional financing; (iii) one national coordination mechanism for \ncollecting,  sharing,  and  analyzing  and  reporting  land  degradation-related  data;  and  (iv) \nparticipatory  processes  use  that  is  acceptable  for  promoting  understanding  of  integrated \necosystem management principles, community involvement, local-level land use planning, and \nsocial planning. \n \n38.  Participatory  Processes.  Based  on  international  and  domestic  successes  in \naddressing land degradation and rehabilitating degraded ecosystems, proven approaches and \ntechniques will be promoted. These include promoting understanding of land degradation\u2019s root \ncauses,  strategic  land  degradation  planning  and  ecosystem  zoning,  appropriate  legal  and \nregulatory  systems,  bottom-up  stakeholder  participation  and  multisector  approaches,  and \nsustainable land management incentives.  \n \n39.  Development  Partner  Coordination.  ADB  convened  regular  development  partner \nroundtables to share information on the Partnership\u2019s process and solicit input to the formulation \nof the CPF. This will continue during implementation until adequate government capacity is \nestablished. The PCO will coordinate development partners under the Partnership; disseminate \ninformation on program implementation; and convene regular development partner meetings, to \nfacilitate the mainstreaming of development partner interventions into the Partnership.  \n \n40.  Processing and Implementation Modality. The Project is unique in that it does not fall \ninto either of ADB\u2019s traditional TA or loan categories. Loan processing procedures were followed ", "15 \nthat provide for greater government implementation responsibilities and higher ADB supervision \nintensity.40  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates  \n \n41.  The Project\u2019s total cost is estimated to be $13.8 million equivalent, of which about $2.1 \nmillion will be in foreign exchange and about $11.7 million equivalent will be in local currency, \ninclusive of duties and taxes. Summary cost estimates for each component are given in Table 1. \nA financial incentive for full and early compliance by provinces and/or regions will come from \nproject contingencies.

Financing Plan  \n \n42.  The Project will be financed by GEF on a grant basis and administered by ADB in the \namount  of  $7.7  million  equivalent,  of  which  approximately  $2.1  million  will  be  in  foreign \nexchange and approximately $5.6 million equivalent will be in local currency. GEF will finance \n100% of the incremental costs required to obtain global benefits.41 The Chief Executive Officer \nof the GEF endorsed the GEF\u2019s cofinancing on 25 May 2004. The Government will contribute \nthe  balance  of  the  local  currency  baseline  cost  of  $6.1  million  to  cover  counterpart  staff \nremuneration  and  per  diems;  office  accommodation  and  supplies;  local  transport  and \ncommunications, workshops, and training; and all duties and taxes. Table 2 shows the financing \ndetails, including the Government\u2019s contribution of $3.25 million in cash and $2.85 million in \nkind. \n \n                                                 \n40\n These processes are appropriate, given the (i) complex policy and/or institutional reform agenda to improve land \nmanagement in western PRC and the need for government ownership of this process; (ii) previous TA projects and \nthe considerable dialogue that has taken place over a 3-year preparatory period; and (iii) specific organizational \narrangements already put in place at the central and provincial levels. \n41\n In GEF\u2019s terminology, baseline costs are the Project\u2019s \u201cnormal costs\u201d, whereas \u201cincremental costs\u201d are those \nrequired to obtain global benefits.

Details are given in Appendix 7. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n43.  Overall  Arrangements.  The  coordination  and  management  arrangements  were \ndeveloped, tested, and adjusted over the 3-year preparation period and are working well. The \narrangements comprise one high-level steering committee,42 one PCO and one PMO that share \na common office, several provincial PCOs and PMOs with similar structures to their central-level \ncounterparts, and four advisory groups. Appendix 8 provides the details. \n \n44.  Project  Coordination  Office.  Headed  by  the  Director  General,  Department  of \nInternational Cooperation in MOF, the central PCO will (i) report to the Steering Committee; (ii) \nliaise with GEF, ADB, and international organizations; (iii) coordinate central agencies, dealing \nspecifically with interagency issues; and (iv) provide guidance to the central PMO, through \nprogress monitoring. The members of the central PCO will represent each of the agencies that \nare represented on the Steering Committee. In each province and region, respective finance \nbureaus will head provincial PCOs and report to vice governors.  \n \n45.  Project Management Office. The PMO is headed by the Deputy Director General, \nDepartment of Science and Technology, SFA, which is the Project\u2019s Executing Agency. The \noffice comprises representatives of the same agencies represented on the Steering Committee \nand in the PCO. The PMO will be responsible for (i) developing the annual work plan and \nimplementing  arrangements,  with  ADB  and  consultant  support;  (ii)  managing  all  project \ncomponents,  including  contract  management  and  related  activities;  (iii)  implementing  and \nguiding, daily, the provincial PMOs; and (iv) managing funds disbursed by MOF from the central \nimprest account into the central PMO account (para. 51). These funds will be used for the \nactivities  specified  in  approved  work  plans.  The  PMO  will  also  assist  provincial  PMOs  in \nmanaging the funds released by MOF for the agreed provincial work plans. Moreover, the PMO \nwill be responsible for supporting advisory groups. To this end, the PMO will undertake work \nplanning and prepare reports and schedules. The PMO has six full-time staff members and four \npart-time staff members. The part-time staff members were recruited from participating agencies \nor by contract. The PMO office was set up in 2002 and moved to the Debao Hotel in November \n2003.  \n                                                 \n42\n The Steering Committee will continue to coordinate the 11 participating agencies and 6 provinces and/or regions. \nThe committee comprises senior representatives from the National Development and Reform Commission, MOF, \nMOA, MWR, Ministry of Land and Resources, SEPA, CAS, SFA, Ministry of Science and Technology, Legislative \nWork  Committee  of  the  National  People\u2019s  Congress,  and  Legislative  Affairs  Office  of  the  State  Council. \nRepresentatives from other agencies may be invited to join the Steering Committee, as appropriate (e.g., Office of \nthe Leading Group for Western Region Development of the State Council). The committee will meet regularly.  \nImportant functions will be approving the annual work program and annual report. Advisory groups (e.g., policy and \nlegal framework, land degradation monitoring and evaluation, and institutional coordination) will assist the Steering \nCommittee. ", "17 \n46.  Provincial  Project  Coordination  Offices,  Project  Management  Offices,  and \nAdvisory Groups. Each participating province and/or region established its own PCO and PMO \narrangement. Provincial PCOs are headed by the Finance Bureau, and provincial PMOs are \nheaded by the Forestry Bureau. In each case, these PCOs and PMOs report to their respective \nvice  governors.  Four  advisory  groups  (i.e.,  policy  and  legal  framework,  land  degradation \nmonitoring and evaluation, institutional coordination, and integrated ecosystem management \n[financed by ADB\u2019s TA; see para. 57]), each with 8\u201310 members, will be established at the \ncentral level, to assist in implementing the Project. The groups will report to the Steering \nCommittee.  \n \n47.  Implementation Period. All components are expected to commence in July 2004 and \nbe completed by June 2008. Flexibility will be needed, based on joint reviews of progress, and a \nprocess approach will be adopted, over all, so that the implementation lessons can be used to \ndirect future priorities. ADB will play an advisory role.43 \n \n48.  Procurement. Goods and related services and equipment financed from the GEF grant \nwill be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Vehicles and materials \nwill be procured through international shopping, with minor items (i.e., those estimated to cost \nless than $100,000) being purchased locally, where appropriate. Equipment and vehicle costs \ntotal $1.14 million equivalent, covering the central Government and six participating provinces \nand/or regions, and are financed by the GEF grant.  See Appendix 9 and Supplementary \nAppendix L for details. \n \n49.  Consulting  Services.  GEF  will  finance  the  services  of  22  person-months  of \ninternational consultants and 187 person-months of domestic consultants (Appendix 10). The \nconsultants will advise the PCO, PMO, and advisory groups in the areas of environmental law, \nnatural resource economics, general planning, participatory approaches, farmer field schools, \ngeographical information systems, and integrated ecosystem management project design. All \nconsultants will be required to prepare specific reports based on the activities undertaken and \nwill assist, as appropriate, in implementing studies, workshops, seminars, meetings, and training \nunder components 1\u20135. Consultants will be recruited through international and domestic firms \nand  other  suitable  organizations  (e.g.,  top  universities,  research  agencies,  nongovernment \norganizations, or other specialized organizations). Individual specialists may be recruited on the \nbasis  of  technical  expertise.  To  the  extent  possible,  procurement  will  be  on  the  basis  of \ncompetitive  procedures.  In  exceptional  circumstances,  where  service  providers  are  limited, \ndirect selection may be applied, with ADB\u2019s prior approval. Consultants will be recruited in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for engaging individual domestic consultants.  \n \n50.   Typically, consultants financed by ADB funds or by funds administered by ADB would \nbe  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  Section  2.01  of  the  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants. For the reasons described in paragraph 1 above, it was considered that this \nProject would be more appropriately processed and administered by applying loan procedures. \nAmong other things, the application of loan procedures shifts the responsibility for engaging \nconsultants to the Government and the EA. Board approval will be sought for the application of \nloan processing and administration procedures for the Project and related retroactive financing. \n                                                 \n43\n ADB has strengthened its resident mission in Beijing for this purpose. ", "18 \nADB has assessed the Executing Agency\u2019s capability and considers the Executing Agency to \nhave the capacity and experience needed to handle consultant recruitment. 44  \n \n51.  Project Financing Agreement and Negotiations. The  proceeds  of  the  GEF  grant, \nonce formally approved by GEF, will be remitted to the Government by ADB, in accordance with \n(i) a memorandum of understanding between ADB and the GEF Secretariat; (ii) a financial \nprocedures agreement between ADB and the World Bank, as trustee of the GEF Trust Fund; \nand (iii) the various terms and conditions set forth in a financing agreement to be entered into \nbetween the Government and ADB, which will record the agreement of the parties on how the \nGEF grant is to be administered. In particular, the agreement will provide for the proceeds of the \nGEF grant to be disbursed in the first instance into an imprest account to be established by \nMOF at a bank acceptable to ADB. The imprest account will be managed and replenished in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, dated January 2001. The initial amount \nto be deposited into the imprest account will be based on the amount estimated to be required \nto implement the GEF-financed components of the Project over the first 6 months. MOF will \ndisburse  the  GEF  grant\u2019s  proceeds  to  the  PMO  and  the  six  provinces  and/or  regions,  in \naccordance with the consolidated annual work and financial plans of the PMO and the six \nprovinces and/or regions, which will be the PMO\u2019s responsibility to consolidate and submit to \nMOF.  \n \n52.  Advance Action and Retroactive Financing. Advance action for recruiting consultants \nand  procuring  goods  and  services  may  be  undertaken  prior  to  effectiveness  of  the  legal \ndocumentation. The Board will be asked to approve retroactive financing in an amount not \nexceeding $700,000 for GEF expenditures incurred after 1 November 2003 relating to  (i) office \noperations at the central and provincial levels, (ii) workshops and preliminary training, (iii) office \nequipment and incremental staff, and (iv) consultants selected and engaged after 11 March \n2004. The Government has been advised that advance action and retroactive financing does \nnot commit either GEF or ADB to finance the project. \n \n53.  Anticorruption Measures. The Project will comply with ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy, \nparticularly  in  respect  of  the  sections  of  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  and  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants that relate to fraud and corruption. External auditors \nwhose qualifications, experience, and terms of reference are acceptable to ADB will audit the \nproject accounts annually, and the Executing Agency will submit audited reports in a timely \nmanner. \n \n54.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting. The Executing Agency will maintain separate \nrecords and accounts that will identify the goods and services financed from the GEF grant\u2019s \nproceeds, the financing resources received, the expenditures incurred for the Project, and the \nuse of local funds. The accounts will be established and maintained in accordance with sound \naccounting  principles.  The  annual  consolidated  project  accounts  and  related  financial \nstatements for the Executing Agency will be audited and translated by auditors acceptable to \nADB. The audited reports and related financial statements will be submitted to ADB not later \nthan 9 months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate. The Government was \n                                                 \n44\n The Government took significant measures to support its implementation role, including: (i) accepting strong \ninterdepartmental support from 11 agencies, under the high-level Steering Committee\u2019s guidance, over the past 3 \nyears; (ii) accepting similar high-level support from the six participating provinces and/or regions, including direct \nfinancial commitments; (iii) establishing MOF\u2019s coordination role, as the overall executing agency for the OP12 \nPartnership on land degradation in Dryland Ecosystems; (iv) producing a financial contribution of $6.1 million; and \n(v) putting in place extensive preparations, including opening the joint PMO and PCO office in the Debao Hotel in \nBeijing in November 2003, which is located next to GEF\u2019s country office.  ", "19 \ninformed of ADB\u2019s policy on the submission of audited accounts, which covers failure to submit \naudited accounts and financial statements within the due date. A formal warning will be issued \nfor accounts more than 6 months overdue, and disbursements will be suspended for accounts \nthat are 12 months overdue. \n \n55.  Project Monitoring and Evaluation. The Project requires regular and timely feedback \nbetween components and incorporation of new and updated information, as this becomes \navailable. This will serve to adapt and refine individual components and activities to enhance \ntheir  effectiveness  and  impact.  The  improved  system  for  monitoring  land  and  ecosystem \ndegradation that constitutes component 5 of the Project will feed into the program monitoring \nsystem, notably in assessing the impacts on the program goal of combating dryland ecosystem \ndegradation.  \n \n56.  Project Reports and Reviews. The PCO and PMO will jointly submit an annual work \nplan and annual reports, to be reviewed in annual meetings with the Steering Committee, GEF, \nand ADB, and will be jointly responsible for the final report. The Executing Agency will prepare \nsix  monthly  progress  reports  indicating  progress  made,  problems  during  the  period  under \nreview, steps taken or proposed to remedy the problems, proposed program of activities, and \nprogress expected for the following quarter. The PCO will ensure that copies are consolidated \nand submitted to ADB. The Government and ADB will jointly review project implementation at \nleast once a year, to identify and resolve major issues. Copies of annual reports, and other \nreports as required, will be provided to GEF. A comprehensive joint review will be undertaken \n12  months  after  project  commencement,  and  future  implementation  will  be  directed  by  its \nfindings. Within 6 months of project completion, the PMO, with support from the provinces \nand/or regions, will submit a completion report that describes project implementation, costs \n(actual) incurred, benefits, and other information requested by ADB or GEF. \n \nIV.  ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK-FINANCED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n57.  The ADB-financed TA\u2019s objectives are to monitor overall CPF implementation and assist \nin implementing the Project. Key outputs will be advice, reports, and recommendations on (i) \nbest  practices  for  integrated  ecosystem  management  approaches  to  combating  land \ndegradation,  including  setting  up  an  integrated  ecosystem  management  expert  group  of \ndomestic experts, to promote networking among PRC scientists, researchers, and organizations \nand advise on project implementation; (ii) past land degradation intervention results; (iii) studies, \nworkshops,  seminars,  and  training  programs  planning;  (iv)  international  scientific  links  to \nongoing land degradation-relevant programs and projects; (v) relevant projects and programs \nidentification  in  the  PRC  and  overseas;  and  (vii)  appropriate  ADB  safeguard  policies \ncompliance, including a minority peoples plan. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1 million \nequivalent, comprising about $507,500 in foreign exchange and roughly $492,500 equivalent in \nlocal currency costs; the Government will provide $200,000 as counterpart funds. The TA will be \nimplemented  over  36  months  and  will  finance  19  person-months  of  international  and  103 \nperson-months of domestic expertise. Consulting services will relate to monitoring and priority \nareas where international and national best practices will assist implementation (especially \nenvironmental law and policy, land degradation assessment, planning, and management). The \nExecuting Agency will be MOF, as the Executing Agency for the overall CPF. Consultants will \nbe  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging individual domestic consultants. Details are \nprovided in Appendix 11. \n ", "20 \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n \n58.  Environmental.  Land degradation is perhaps the most difficult environmental challenge \nto address in the PRC. The problem\u2019s scale is huge, and many trends are worsening, especially \nin dryland environments. International experience strongly suggests that a comprehensive, long-\nterm process based on a holistic approach is needed. The Project will assist the PRC in meeting \nits international commitments under the CCD, CBD, and United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change. Consultations and disclosure of the policy and institutional interventions \nand mitigation measures to be used under the Project occurred during design (Appendix 4). \n \n59.  Technical. The Project has a major role to play in promoting integrated and participatory \napproaches to combating land degradation where, traditionally, sector oriented and top-down \napproaches have dominated. Internationally accepted best practices, based on ecosystem-level \nunderstanding  and  sound  ecological  and  financial  principles,  will  complement  best  PRC \npractices. \n \n60.  Policy  and  Legal.  A  structured  basis  will  be  provided  for  overcoming  policy  and \nlegislative barriers that constrain land and natural resource management programs formulation \nand implementation. Overcoming policy contradictions and improving the quality of relevant \nlaws and regulations, together with coordinated approaches at national, provincial, and local \nlevels, will help establish the preconditions for restoring ecosystem productivity and reducing \npoverty. \n \n61.  Institutional.  Personnel  from  government  agencies  at  national  and  local  levels  will \nbenefit from the introduction of new approaches and capacity-building activities. Private sector \norganizations will benefit from clearer market-oriented rules and incentives for investment in \nnatural resources. Improved development partner coordination will lead to greater concessional \nresources  being  available  to  some  of  the  poorest  provinces  and/or  regions.  Improved \ncoordination mechanisms at national, provincial, and county levels; strengthened links between \nnational and local levels; effective investment projects under the CPF; and effective operational \narrangements will promote greater understanding, reduce duplication, and improve efficiency. \n \n62.  Social. The sustainability of the Project\u2019s benefits will depend on benefits being captured \nby rural land users. Increasing the ability of local communities, including those with minority \npeoples, to control their own resources will strengthen sustainability of project activities. The \nProject will use participatory processes acceptable to ADB and the Government to promote \nlocal  ownership  for  improved  management  with  local  governments  and  the  private  sector \n(Appendix 12). Supplementary Appendix M provides information on the framework for a minority \npeoples development plan. \n \n63.  Economic and Financial. Financial and economic sustainability will be promoted by \nreduced  duplication  and  waste  of  resources.  Increased  emphasis  will  be  placed  on  (i) \nmonitoring the impacts of government expenditures on land degradation trends; (ii) providing \nfiscal incentives; (iii) increasing private sector involvement in natural resource management; and \n(iv) using economic measures in environmental planning. \n \n64.  Global. Global benefits will eventually accrue in three areas through the measures that \nwill be supported by the Project and will be further extended through other investments under \nthe CPF. For carbon capture, improved agricultural land management in the western region has ", "21 \nthe potential to contribute over 25 million tons of carbon storage annually by 2012. Improved \ngrassland, forest, and woodland management in the western region has the potential to capture \n87 million tons of carbon by 2012.45 The many threatened ecosystems and species of global \nimportance found in the western region will be protected and conserved through targeting \nactivities  in  critical  ecoregions  and  integrating  biodiversity  conservation  into  improved \necosystem management. In terms of land degradation, prioritizing cost-effective interventions in \nthose areas most susceptible to desertification, including those identified as source areas of \ntransboundary dust storms and sandstorms will help reduce their frequency and severity in the \nlonger term.   \n \nB.  Risks \n \n65.  Interagency Cooperation. Effective cooperation between agencies at all levels may not \nbe achieved. This major risk is addressed by involving all stakeholders through national and \nlocal  leading  groups  and  coordination  offices  and  workshops  promoting  the  proven \nadvantages\u2014including financial investments under the CPF\u2014of a cooperative approach. Local \nleaders will be targeted for training and awareness building under the Project. \n \n66.  Institutional. The risk exists that the Government will not sustain its commitment to \npursue the necessary reforms to overcome institutional and legal and/or regulatory barriers or to \nharmonize  programs  and  budgets.  Risk  mitigation  will  be  achieved  through  the  Steering \nCommittee, the coordinating role of MOF, the incorporation of reforms into the Eleventh Five-\nYear Plan, and the use of best international practices.  \n \n67.  Policy and Legislative Reforms. These will not be in place in time to influence effective \nimplementation  of  demonstration  projects.  This  risk  is  mitigated  by  the  development  and \nimplementation of the Project at the beginning of the CPF and by continually emphasizing the \nimportance of timely reforms to key decision makers.  \n \n68.  Integrated Ecosystem Management. This cannot be effectively developed, tested, and \ndemonstrated in high-priority localities, due to a lack of acceptance among stakeholders. Risk \nmitigation will be achieved through testing and demonstrating in practical and convincing terms \nthe benefits of an integrated approach based on sound ecological principles. This may include \nincentive and compensation provisions. An international workshop in the first year will assist in \npromoting understanding and the use of integrated ecosystem management. \n \nC.  Overall Assessment \n \n69.  Overall, the benefits and impacts of an integrated approach are expected to outweigh \nthe costs. The CPF\u2019s 10-year period is thought to be adequate for this to occur. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n \n70.  The Government and SFA have given the following assurances, which are incorporated \nin the legal documentation:  \n \n(i)  Counterpart  funds.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  counterpart  funds  are \nprovided  in  a  timely  manner,  including  funds  from  provincial  and/or  regional \ngovernments. \n                                                 \n45\n Details of carbon capture and biodiversity benefits are given in Supplementary Appendix B. ", "22 \n(ii)  Coordination arrangements and mechanisms. The Government will ensure  \nadequate  coordination  of  all  participating  central  agencies  and  participating \nprovincial and/or autonomous regional governments. In particular, (i)  a national \ncoordination mechanism will be established for collecting, sharing, analyzing and \nreporting land degradation-related data; (ii) high-level mechanisms will be set up \nat the central and provincial and/or autonomous regional levels for coordinating \ninvestments  to  control  land  degradation  under  the  Eleventh  Five-Year  Plan \n(2006\u20132010); and (iii) a mechanism will be established to improve development \npartner  coordination  for  concessional  financing  to  combat  land  degradation, \nincluding improved coordination between MOF and the Ministry of Commerce. \n \n(iii)  Participatory approach and social guidelines. The Government will ensure \nthe adoption of participatory processes, acceptable to the Government, and ADB, \nto  promote  (i)  integrated  ecosystem  management  principles;  (ii)  community \ndevelopment; (iii) local-level land use planning; and (iv) social planning, including \nfor minority peoples. \n \n(iv)  Promoting  integrated  ecosystem  management.  To  highlight  integrated \necosystem  management  principles;  promote  mutual  understanding  among \nstakeholders  of  the  key  concepts,  key  problems,  and  root  causes  of  land \ndegradation;  and  support  efforts  to  finance  sustainable  solutions,  the \nGovernment  will  (i)  set  up  an  advisory  group  on  integrated  ecosystem \nmanagement;  (ii)  support  Project  activities  and  networks,  including  for \ndevelopment  partner  coordination;  and  (iii)  support  workshops,  including  an \ninternational workshop during the first year of implementation. \n \n(v)  Advisory groups. The Government will ensure that four advisory groups are set \nup, namely (i) a legal and policy advisory group (component 1); (ii) an institutions \nand planning advisory group (components 2, 3, 4, and 6); (iii) a land degradation \nmonitoring and evaluation advisory group (component 5); and (iv) an integrated \necosystem management advisory group, to promote networking among PRC \nscientists  and  organizations  and  advise  the  provinces  and/or  regions  on \nparticipatory approaches to integrated ecosystem management. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n71.  I recommend that the Board approve (i) ADB administering a grant not exceeding the \nequivalent of $7,700,000 to the Government of the People's Republic of China for the Capacity \nBuilding  to  Combat  Land  Degradation  Project,  (ii)  the  application  of  loan  processing  and \nadministration  procedures  for  the  Project,  and  (iii)  retroactive  financing  in  an  amount  not \nexceeding $700,000 as described in detail in paragraph 52 above. \n \nTadao Chino\nPresident \n4 June 2004 ", "    \nPROJECT LOGICAL FRAMEWORK \n \n       \nDesign Summary  Performance Indicators and Targets  Monitoring Mechanisms  Key Assumptions and Risks \n       \nA.

The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in 2000 to take a lead role in facilitating the preparation of the PRC-\nGlobal Environment Facility (GEF) Partnership on Land Degradation in Dryland Ecosystems, \nunder Operational Program 12, which involves integrated ecosystem management (IEM). ADB \nprovided several technical assistance (TA) projects to develop the Partnership at the central, \nprovincial, and regional levels.1 These projects resulted in a country programming framework \n(CPF). A high-level steering committee guided the development of the Partnership.2 The CPF, \nincluding the draft Project, was described in a Framework Brief that was approved by GEF\u2019s \ncouncil during an October 2002 meeting.  \n \n2.  In April 2003, the first phase of the Government-ADB joint Fact-Finding Mission was held \nin Inner Mongolia and Shaanxi. The second phase was held after Sudden Acute Respiratory \nSyndrome outbreak was brought under control and included visits to the remaining four provinces \nand/or autonomous regions in July 2003. Written submissions were sought from each province \nand/or region, to gauge their priorities and commitment levels. Detailed presentations were given \nby ADB in all areas, and high-level discussions were held with provincial leaders. Strong interest \nwas  shown  in  the  integrated  ecosystem  management  approach.  To  provide  additional \ndocumentation, several staff consultants were engaged to work with ADB staff members and \nGovernment representatives in August and September 2003. \n \n3.  The high-level Steering Committee approved the Project\u2019s final outline on 8 September \n2003.  A  staff  review  committee  meeting  was  held  on  23  October  2003.  The  meeting\u2019s \nparticipants decided that the Project should be processed in accordance with loan rather than TA \nprocessing  procedures,  because  loan  procedures  provide  for  greater  implementation \nresponsibilities by the Government and higher supervision intensity. Use of loan processing \nprocedures was endorsed by the Strategy and Policy Department in January 2004. In November \n2003, new offices of the central project coordination office and project management office were \nopened in the Debao Hotel (rooms 427 and 428, respectively). A management review meeting \nwas held on 18 February 2004. Appraisal was undertaken 2\u201311 March 2004 in Beijing, with a \nwrap meeting at the Ministry of Finance on 16 March 2004. At appraisal, a meeting was held with \nhigh-level representatives of the Steering Committee, and these representatives indicated the \nstrongest possible support of the Government. The Chief Executive Officer of the GEF endorsed \nthe GEF\u2019s cofinancing on 25 May 2004. \n                                                 \n1\n ADB. 2000.

Introduction \n \n1.  The overall goal of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC)-Global Environment Facility \n(GEF)  Partnership  on  Land  Degradation  (LD)  in  Dryland  Ecosystems  is  to  reduce  land \ndegradation, alleviate poverty, and restore dryland ecosystems in the western region. The \nPartnership\u2019s specific purpose is to assist the Government in establishing an effective integrated \necosystem management system1 that will generate global benefits from enhanced biodiversity \nconservation and carbon capture and reduce poverty through sustainable use and equitable \nbenefit sharing. The goal of the Project is to reduce LD, alleviate poverty, and restore dryland \necosystems in the western region. The Project will provide major environmental benefits and will \nnot have direct negative environmental impacts that need to be mitigated. It was classified as \nenvironmental  category  B  (nonsensitive)  because  the  highly  degraded  and  impoverished \nwestern region has globally significant biodiversity and the Project will positively influence the \npolicy  and  regulatory  framework  and  build  institutional  capacity  to  implement  future \nenvironmental projects and programs. Accordingly, a summary initial environmental examination \nwas prepared following the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) requirements for environmental \nassessment.  The  purpose  of  this  examination  was  to  identify  the  Project\u2019s  environmental \nbenefits  and  evaluate  remaining  areas  of  concern  and  measures  to  address  them.  The \nexamination was prepared based on detailed discussions at the central level (2001\u20132003), field \nvisits (to all participating areas in 2002\u20132003) and investigations, and detailed discussions with \nstaff members of the concerned agencies at central, provincial, and regional levels and other \nrelated agencies and was reviewed by technical subject matter specialists and experts. \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n2.  The PRC-GEF Partnership is a long-term country programming framework (CPF) that \nwas approved by GEF\u2019s council during an October 2002 meeting. The CPF (2003\u20132012) seeks \nto  combat  LD  through  investments  that  will  strengthen  the  enabling  environment,  build \ninstitutional  capacity,  and  demonstrate  viable  investment  project  models  under  GEF\u2019s \nOperational Program 12 on integrated ecosystem management. The total cost of the 10\u2013year \nCPF is estimated at about $1.5 billion equivalent, of which GEF will provide $150 million for \neligible investments. The Project, which was also approved by GEF\u2019s council in October 2002, \nwill strengthen the enabling environment and build institutional capacity to adopt an integrated \napproach. The Project will result in an improved policy and regulatory framework for combating \nLD. In addition, the Project will enhance national and provincial coordination mechanisms and \nstrengthen  capacity  for  strategic  integrated  ecosystem  management  planning,  improve \nprovincial and field-level LD control, improve provincial capacity for formulating LD control \ninvestment projects, improve nationwide LD monitoring and assessment, and apply effective \nCPF implementation arrangements. \n \n3.  Drylands occupy 40% of the PRC's land area and are home to over 100 million people. \nThese areas are extensively affected by LD, with severe economic, social, and ecological \nconsequences,  especially  for  the  rural  poor  and  ethnic minorities  who  inhabit  the  western \nregion. Dust storms, originating within the drylands, adversely impact life and infrastructure \nwithin and outside the country's borders. Previous policies and poor land use practices are the \nprimary causes of LD, and the Government wishes to adopt a more integrated approach to this \nincreasing problem. Although government expenditures significantly increased in recent years, \n                                                 \n1\n Integrated ecosystem management is defined in footnote 2 of the main text. ", "Appendix 4  37 \nthe  sector  approach  being  implemented  by  different  agencies  (e.g.,  those  concerned  with \nforestry, agriculture, and water resources), through separate and uncoordinated programs, is \ntoo expensive and not working effectively. International experience strongly suggests that a \nmore integrated and coordinated approach, on an ecosystem basis, is required. Key problem \nareas  to  be  addressed  were  identified  as  (i)  incomplete  understanding  of  technical  and \ninstitutional  problems,  (ii)  incomplete  policy  and  legislative  framework,  (iii)  limited  role  of \nmarkets, (iv) institutional and sector-driven fragmentation of existing efforts to address LD, (v) \ninconsistent sector approach and area planning, and (vi) inadequate budget resources and \nfinancial incentives at the local level. \n \n4.  Based on analysis of key problems and opportunities, it was recognized that introducing \nan integrated ecosystem management approach to sustainable development is a long-term \ngoal. Accordingly, it was identified that the objective of the Project should be to assist the \nGovernment in combating LD, reducing poverty, and restoring dryland ecosystems, through \nstrengthening the enabling environment and developing institutional capacity. The Project will \nwork at the central level and in the six priority provinces and/or autonomous regions that are the \nmost  degraded  dryland  areas  of  the  western  region:  Gansu  Province,  Inner  Mongolia \nAutonomous Region, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Qinghai Province, Shaanxi Province, \nand Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. These localities are the main focus for the CPF\u2019s first \nphase.  Each  area  has  indicated  high-level  political  support  for  the  reforms  needed  in  the \nenabling  conditions  (existing  policies,  legislative  framework,  well-coordinated  institutional \narrangements,  harmonized  plans,  and  existing  budgets)  that  are  essential  for  sustained \nprogress in arresting LD. To accomplish the Project's objective, six coordinated components \nand their supporting activities are (i) improving the policy, laws, and regulations for LD control; \n(ii) strengthening national and provincial coordination; (iii) improving operational arrangements \nat  provincial  and  county  levels;  (iv)  developing  capacity  for  LD  investment  projects;  (v) \nestablishing a coordinated monitoring and evaluation system for LD; and (vi) implementation \narrangements for the CPF.  \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n5.  General. The western region comprises 12 provinces and autonomous regions, many of \nwhich  have  a  physical  size  and population similar  to  some  Asian  countries  and  could  be \ncompared with least-developed nations. The western region supports a population of at least \n350  million,  including  many  of  the  country\u2019s  poorest  and  most  vulnerable  people.  Low \nproductivity  is  caused  in  part  by  fragile  soils,  water  scarcity,  and  erratic  rainfall  patterns. \nDesertification is concentrated in the northern and northwestern regions, which lay in the arid, \nsemiarid, and dry subhumid zones. There is a high degree of overlap between ecologically \nsensitive areas and poverty counties in western PRC. Predominantly rural, these areas have low \npopulation densities, large ethnic minority populations, high reliance on grazing and agriculture, \nhigh  poverty  incidence,  huge  mineral  deposits,  and  very  arid  and  fragile  environments. \nDevelopment is severely constrained by the area\u2019s massive territorial expanse, long distances \nbetween population centers and eastern markets, poor economic and social infrastructure, and \nlow institutional capacity (lower than that in coastal areas). \n \n6.  Global Significance. The PRC has more of the world\u2019s known biodiversity than nearly \nall other countries on earth and a higher proportion of endemic species than any other.2 Steppe \nand desert ecosystems have disproportionately higher rates of endemism (16\u201323%) than most \n                                                 \n2\n See footnote 16 of the main text. ", "38  Appendix 4 \nother  ecosystems  (2\u201314%).  The  PRC\u2019s  other  regions  have  less  than  50,000  species,  not \nincluding invertebrates, lower plants, fungi, bacteria, and actinomycetes.  \n \n7.  The  existing  85  established  nature  reserves  in  the  western  region  cover  all  of  the \necoregions identified in the World Wildlife Fund classification of ecoregions, although much of \nthe biodiversity lies outside protected areas. The greatest threat to biodiversity in the PRC is \nhabitat loss through desertification and forest and woodland clearance and other forms of land \nand  vegetation  degradation.  As  natural  habitats  shrink  and  become  fragmented,  individual \nspecies are increasingly threatened by direct or indirect exploitation, and may face extinction. \n \n8.  Dust storms have global significance for atmospheric conditions. Degraded grasslands, \nlarge-scale mechanized farming, and saltpans on the edges of dried-up saline lakes are the \nsources of dust storms in northwest and north PRC. The impact is felt not only in Beijing but \nalso on the Korean peninsula and in Japan. Dust from the PRC was identified along the west \ncoast of the USA. The Project\u2019s six provinces and/or autonomous regions have 97% of the \nPRC\u2019s wind-eroded and desert land, which is the source of all dust storm activity originating in \nnorthern PRC, and have 54% of the country\u2019s water-eroded areas. Establishing vegetation on \ndegraded land and promoting zero and minimum tillage systems will reduce dust storms and \nimprove atmospheric conditions through carbon capture above and below the earth. \n \n9.  Consequences of Land Degradation. The social and economic consequences of LD \nare profound, and they include notably lower household incomes, increased poverty in many \nrural communities, higher unemployment, and increased migration. These trends have led to \nreduced  agricultural  and  pastoral  land  productive  capacity;  damaged  roads  and  other \ninfrastructure; and lost watershed protection functions, resulting in increased productive land \nand reservoir sedimentation. Estimates of economic losses due to LD are provided in paragraph \n7, main text.  \n \n10.  Poverty,  Ethnicity,  and  Population  Growth.  In  2001,  the  Government  redefined \npoverty counties. The breakdown of poverty counties by provinces and/or regions involved in \nthe project is Gansu (43), Inner Mongolia (31), Ningxia Hui (8), Qinghai (15), Shaanxi (50), and \nXinjiang Uygur (27). The total of 174 counties represents 29% of the national total of 592. In \nGansu and Xinjiang Uygur, for example, the proportion of people living below the $1 per day \nincome line is 27% and 23%, respectively. The capacity of these counties to finance their own \ndevelopment and expand their economic base is very limited. The poor become increasingly \nvulnerable where their local biophysical environment has deteriorated. Women suffer more than \nmen from LD in terms of health, nutrition, employment, and income. In 2000, the population of \nethnic groups in the western region was 76.5 million, or 21.5% of the total population in the west \nand 71.9% of the total minority population nationwide. Within the six target provinces, there are \nthree  ethnic  autonomous  regions:  Inner  Mongolia  Autonomous  Region,  Ningxia  Hui \nAutonomous Region, and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. For historical reasons, ethnic \nminorities  mostly  live  in  remote  and  often  mountainous  areas  that  have  harsh  natural \nenvironments and a high incidence of poverty. The poverty incidence where ethnic minorities \nare dominant is more than 10%, compared with about 4% for Han dominant communities.3 \n \n11.  Despite  recent  central  policies,  institutional  fragmentation  adversely  affected  the \neffectiveness  of  poverty  alleviation  and  LD  control  programs.  Provincial  poverty  alleviation \noffices have direct responsibility for program implementation, but they are largely ineffective, as \n                                                 \n3\n Zhao, Xi . 2001.

", "Appendix 4  39 \nresponsibilities  are  spread  over  several  government  departments,  leading  to  coordination \ndifficulties. In the forestry sector, for example, there is no effective mechanism that enables \npoverty  alleviation  initiatives  to  be  integrated  into  the  ecological  construction  programs  of \nprovincial forestry bureaus. \n \n12.  For information on population growth and ethnicity, see Appendix 12, paragraph 6. \n \n13.  Previous  Production-Oriented  Policies.  Policies  initiated  in  the  early  1980s  have \nstrongly influenced land management in rural localities in the western region. As a result, the \nincome gap between better-off and poorest groups has widened over the past 20 years. In \naddition, more so-called wasteland is being cultivated by farmers, to increase production to pay \nfor education, medical, and tax expenses. Lack of stable land-use rights by farmers in the \nwestern region also contributes to excessive cultivation that, in turn, exacerbates LD. Official \nmigration for agriculture in the ecologically fragile western region also contributed to LD. For \nexample, near Qinghai Lake, the degraded landscape is a source of seasonal dust storms. \n \nD.  Screening of Environmental Issues \n \n14.  General. Key environmental issues identified are presented in some detail in the main \ntext of this report. The broad scope of the Government\u2019s past and ongoing efforts to combat LD \nis acknowledged in paras. 11 and 12 of the main text. The sector-specific nature of massive \ncurrent expenditure has led to concerns of less than optimal impact and the need for an \nintegrated ecosystem management approach and improved coordination of LD efforts. The \nidentified key problem areas (paras. 14 to 20 of the main text) have been agreed with the \nGovernment,  and  these  will  be  systematically  addressed  under  the  Project.  The  essential \nenvironmental, technical, legal and policy, institutional, social, financial, and economic issues \nhave been identified at the central, provincial, and regional levels in the project area. Of these, \nthe  essential  institutional  coordination  mechanisms  represent  the  greatest  challenge.  The \nGovernment expressed its intention to aggressively pursue the reforms to be supported by the \nProject under the forthcoming Eleventh Five-Year Plan. \n \n15.  Critical Ecoregions. China\u2019s Biodiversity: A Country Study (footnote 16, main text) \nreinforced the need to prioritize specific ecosystems and species as critical biodiversity regions. \nMore recently, the World Wildlife Fund developed a classification of ecoregions that has a \nhigher level of resolution to assess biodiversity features and priorities.4 Ecoregions are defined \nas relatively large units of land or water containing a distinct assemblage of natural communities \nand species, with boundaries that approximate the original extent of natural communities prior to \nmajor land-use change. Existing conservation status (if known), physical accessibility, general \nassessment of LD, and degree of threat have also been taken into account.5 \n \n16.  Pilot  Sites.  The  CPF\u2019s  first  phase  (2003\u201306)  targets  specific  areas  within  the  six \nprovinces  and/or  regions  with  high  priority  for  combating  LD  from  national  and  global \nenvironment perspectives. The relevant areas were identified according to the following agreed \ncriteria: (i) global environmental significance (as stated in the Biodiversity Conservation Action \nPlan); (ii) severe LD (as highlighted in the Convention to Combat Desertification National Action \nPlan);  (iii)  potential  for  poverty  reduction  and  economic  development  (as  evidenced  by \n                                                 \n4\n David M.

Project Selection Criteria. The following eligibility criteria will be used in screening \npotential future investment projects: (i) addresses enabling legal and regulatory framework \nconditions  that  enhance  incentives  and  enforcement  mechanisms  for  improved  ecosystem \nmanagement; (ii) demonstrates an integrated and participatory approach, rather than a sector-\nbased approach, and fosters increased coordination among line agencies: (iii) involves local \ncommunities and all stakeholders fully in identifying, designing, planning, implementing, and \nmonitoring sustainable ecosystem management projects; (iv) tests innovative and coordinated \ninstitutional arrangements, technology systems, land use planning tools, adaptive management \napproaches,  and  public-private  partnerships;  (v)  achieves  a  synergy  among  biodiversity \nconservation, carbon sequestration, and LD control objectives through sustainable agriculture \nand  rural  development  activities,  with  an  emphasis  on  locally  appropriated  benefits  and \nsustainable livelihoods; and (vi) includes a structured monitoring and evaluation component to \ngenerate lessons for potential replication. \n \nE.  Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures  \n \n18.  Improving the Policies, Laws, and Regulations for Land Degradation Control. The \nquality of environmental policy, legislation, and regulations will be improved through a structured \napproach to the formulation and implementation of land and natural resources management \nprograms. This will help establish the preconditions for restoring ecosystem productivity and \nreducing poverty. Specific measures include (i) establishing procedures and mechanisms that \nwill  improve  the  quality  of  law  and  policy  needed  to  implement  integrated  ecosystem \nmanagement; (ii) promoting capacity building and education in legislative and policy aspects of \nLD management; and (iii) accepting specialist policy, legal, and regulatory advice and problem \nsolving  support,  including  a  legal  and  policy  advisory  group  to  guide  the  implementation \n(Supplementary Appendix D). \n \n19.  Strengthening National and Provincial Coordination. Future agricultural and natural \nresources planning and management needs will be based on sound ecological principles. The \nbenefits from an effectively coordinated approach to LD management under the forthcoming \nEleventh Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010) would be significant and include greater sector plans \nharmonization,  integrated  ecosystem  management  approaches  mainstreaming,  and  budget \nallocations rationalization in the involved provinces and/or regions. An institutions and planning \nexpert group will be formed, comprising representatives of all involved agencies, to guide the \nimplementation of components 2, 3, 4, and 6. Other specific activities under this component are \n(i) formulation of LD strategies at the province and/or region level; (ii) measurement of the \neconomic  costs  and  benefits  of  LD  control  through  field  studies;  (iii)  implementation  of  a \nfeasibility study on establishing integrated ecosystem management training on a permanent \nbasis in the PRC; (iv) harmonization of the approach being taken with the PRC-GEF Partnership \nby revisiting the National Action Plan to Combat Desertification, the Biodiversity Action Plan, \nand other relevant action plans; (v) implementation of workshops to promote strategic integrated \necosystem management planning, including an international workshop in the first year; and (vi) \nfacilitation of study tours and exchanges on integrated ecosystem management. Details appear \nin Supplementary Appendix E. \n ", "Appendix 4  41 \n20.  Improving Operational Arrangements at Provincial and/or Autonomous Region \nand County Levels. Specific measures will be introduced to improve the field-level capacities \nto work with rural communities in bottom-up participatory planning and implementation of field-\nlevel LD control through an integrated ecosystem management approach. Under the guidance \nof the institutions and planning expert group, other activities will include assessing existing \noperational arrangements, institutional capacity, and training needs; identifying field-level best \npractices;  developing  integrated  ecosystem  management  guidelines,  manuals,  and  training \nmaterials; and demonstrating community-based LD control in a minimum of one selected area \nper province and/or region. A minimum of 10 adaptive research grants will also be provided for \nresearch  agencies,  on  a  competitive  basis,  for  participatory  research  and  technologies  to \ncombat LD. A public awareness campaign on the integrated ecosystem management approach \nand  workshops  on  community-based  LD  control,  study,  tours  and/or  exchanges,  and \npublications will be supported. Supplementary Appendix F provides details. \n \n21.  Capacity Development for Land Degradation Investment Projects. Developing the \ncapacity to design, implement, and finance future investment projects is a major element of the \nProject. In each province and/or region, the Project will (i) identify training needs, (ii) examine \nthe impact of past LD investments, and (iii) undertake feasibility studies of integrated ecosystem \nmanagement project investments. These studies will cover high-priority investment projects for \npossible ADB, GEF, or other development partner financing under the PRC-GEF Partnership. \nTo identify potential financing for these future investments, a study of cofinancing options will be \nundertaken to identify one or more modalities for combining loan financing, GEF grants, other \nconcessional resources, and government support. An operational cofinancing modality is a \nprecondition for each province and/or region to benefit from potential investments under the \nPartnership (Supplementary Appendix G). \n \n22.  Monitoring and Evaluation System for Land Degradation. Guided by an advisory \ngroup on monitoring and evaluation that has already been formed, specific measures under the \nProject  will  include  establishing  a  geographic  information  system  at  each  province  and/or \nregion;  performing  LD  assessment  training;  developing  indicators  for  monitoring  LD;  and \nimplementing workshops, study tours, and exchange visits. At the national, provincial, and \nregional  levels,  a  series  of  institutional  stakeholder  consultation  and/or  consensus-building \nmeetings would be held to reach agreement on new mechanisms for coordinating and sharing \nthe collection and analysis of national-level LD datasets. At the community level, the direct \nstakeholders (including farmers, foresters, and herders) would be involved in pilot monitoring \nand assessment studies and would actively participate in assessing the nature, severity, and \nimpact of LD in their local areas. Proven programs and techniques for assessing and monitoring \nLD in the PRC will be supported, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United \nNations and its successful LD assessment pilot program. Outputs of the component will be (i) \ncreation of a national coordination mechanism for collecting, sharing, and analyzing LD-related \ndata;  (ii)  clarification  of  the  role  and  mechanisms  for  provincial  and  county  agencies  to \ncontribute to national LD assessments; and (iii) acceptance of a universally agreed definition of \nLD, including common definitions of specific LD types (e.g., wind erosion, water erosion, soil \nfertility  decline,  and  biodiversity  loss);  common  standards  and  indicators  for  national-level \nmonitoring of specific LD types; and compatible software and standards to facilitate the sharing \nof data sets (Supplementary Appendix H).  \n \n23.  Implementation Arrangements for the Country Programming Framework. Capacity \nwill be developed to support the implementation of the 10\u2013year CPF, including future integrated \necosystem  management  projects  and  development  partner  coordination.  Logistical  and \ntechnical support will be provided for the already established project coordination office in MOF ", "42  Appendix 4 \nand the project management office that was set up in SFA for day-to-day management. These \noffices were established to share a common location. Information exchange between projects, \nagencies, and other stakeholders will be a major activity to promote understanding of lessons \nlearned  and  integrated  ecosystem  management\u2019s  role  and  improve  cooperation  and \ntransparency. A program monitoring and evaluation system based on learning and adaptive \nmanagement is being set up in MOF to ensure that the results of the Project and related \nprojects are used to adjust the program (Supplementary Appendix I). \n \n24.  Table A4 summarizes the six main areas of policy and institutional intervention under the \nProject and their impacts. The role of public consultation in all areas of project design is noted in \nTable A4. \n \nF.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring \n \n25.  To ensure that all applicable national and local environmental laws and regulations, as \nwell as the requirements of ADB, are adhered to during project implementation, it is required \nthat the project management office and project coordination office should monitor the project \nimplementation and report to GEF and ADB annually. A major review will be undertaken at the \nend of the first year of implementation to determine progress. Personnel from government \nagencies at national and local levels will benefit from the introduction of new approaches and \ncapacity-building activities. Private sector organizations will benefit from clearer market-oriented \nrules  and  incentives  for  investment  in  natural  resources.  Improved  development  partner \ncoordination will lead to greater concessional resources being available to some of the poorest \nprovinces  and/or  regions.  Improving  coordination  mechanisms  at  national,  provincial,  and \ncounty levels; strengthening links between national and local levels; implementing investment \nprojects under the CPF; and developing effective operational arrangements will promote greater \nunderstanding, reduce duplication, and improve efficiency. \n \nG.  Conclusion \n \n26.  The Project will have no direct adverse physical impacts on the environment. However, \nto ensure that the policies, standards, and guidelines to be developed under the Project bring \nmaximum benefits and to avoid potential indirect impacts that might stem from implementation \nof inappropriate approaches, it is essential that all agencies be adequately consulted on the \nannual work plan, progress reviews, and monitoring and feedback efforts. The Project will assist \nthe PRC in meeting its international commitments under relevant international conventions, \nincluding those addressing desertification, biodiversity conservation, and climate change. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 4  43 \nTable A4: Policy Matrix\n \nPolicy  Economic and     \nIntervention  Social Outcomes  Environmental Impact  Mitigation Measuresa \n1.

International development assistance in land degradation (LD) in the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC) has been significant, varied, and over a long period. Information presented is \nbased on a survey of projects in the western region during the PRC Government\u2019s Ninth (1996 \nto 2000) and Tenth (2001 to 2005) Five-Year Plans, and has been obtained from websites \nhosted by international development agencies, supplemented by specific enquiries, including at \nroundtable meetings held at Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) PRC Resident Mission over \n2001\u20132003. Projects are described under various headings, including agriculture, grassland \nmanagement, forestry, water and soil conservation, water-saving, biodiversity conservation, \nrural development, desertification control, and environmental management. No donor-assisted \nprojects are described using the term \u201cLD control.\u201d Various terms are used to describe poverty \nalleviation. Supplementary Appendix C provides summary details of 128 projects that have been \nfinanced  by  10  bilateral  and  9  multilateral  agencies.1 Table  A5  lists  31  of  these  projects, \nfinanced  primarily  with  international  assistance,  that  have  particular  relevance  to  future \ninvestments in an integrated management approach to combat LD.  \n \n2.  As a result of this effort, there is a growing body of successful experience with the use of \ncommunity-based  participatory  planning  processes  for  the  design  and  implementation  of \ndifferent types of rural development projects. Experience in the PRC has shown that adopting a \nparticipatory approach to identify and analyze the problems and developing locally appropriate \nsolutions can produce tangible production benefits. One report for ADB technical assistance in \nthe PRC identified some 30 projects that had practical experience with the use of participatory \nplanning and development approaches.2 A common factor in all of these projects is that they \nwere  supported  by  international  development  agencies,  where  adoption  of  a  participatory \napproach was a requirement for receiving financial and technical support. The approach has yet \nto be adopted within projects and programs funded totally from government budget resources. \nThe  adoption  of  participatory  planning  and  technology  development  methods  is  still  the \nexception rather than the rule. Only a limited cadre of research and extension workers at the \nnational, provincial, and county levels has been trained and have the necessary skills to work in \na participatory manner with rural communities in the planning and implementation of improved \nnatural resource management activities.  \n \n3.  For Government-financed projects, sector-specific investments are the normal approach, \nadministered through sector agencies. Some interventions have been successul, based on \ntechnical research on combating LD over the last 50 years (e.g., desert sand stabilization to \nprotect major roads and rail links). However, little research has been done on sustainable \npractices for designing new approaches, policy-relevant data for planning, and issues and \nproblems related to replicating successes and avoiding failures. With few exceptions, projects \nhave  not  been  designed  to  address  the  multisector  dimensions  required  to overcome  LD. \nConsequently,  the  capacity  to  design  and  implement  integrated  ecosystem  management \ninvestments  has  not  been  developed.  Developing  the  capacity  to  design,  implement,  and \n                                                 \n1\n The 128 projects summarized in Supplementary Appendix C comprise 67 bilateral projects and 61 multilateral     \nprojects.  \n2\n ADB. 2002.

Government is aware of the value of international experience and has encouraged \ninnovative approaches within the PRC. Reviews of ongoing Government programs by teams \nincluding leading international experts, such as those supported through the China Council for \nInternational Cooperation on Environment and Development, have played a catalytic role in \nstimulating debate over the impact of LD investments and sustainable development.3  \n \nB.  Project Approach \n \n5.  The  Project  will  build  on  past  successes  in  the  six  provinces  and/or  regions  by \nsensitizing state, provincial, and local government policy makers and senior officials to the \nbenefits of a participatory approach. It will also build a cadre of participatory researchers, \nextension workers, and planners by training them in the concepts, principles, and practice of \nparticipatory appraisal and planning for LD control and restoring ecosystem productivity. The \naim of such training would be to reorient their thinking, and current top-down working methods, \nand provide them with the skills and tools needed to work in partnership with rural communities \nfor the planning and implementation of locally appropriate ecosystem management activities. \n \n6.  The overall impact will be assessed for a selection of projects and approaches identified \n(e.g., from Table A5).4 Accurate feedback on past LD investments, including the costs, benefits, \nand efficiencies of different types of interventions is currently not available to guide future \ninvestment options. Provincial leaders in each area have expressed interest in such information. \nA study of concessional financing options for combating LD will also be undertaken. \n \n7.  In each province and/or region a trained team will undertake at least one feasibility study \nof potential investments, in line with the agreed criteria as set out in Appendix 4.

This appendix provides an overview of the components, \nimplementation, and progress indicators. Implementation arrangements for the overall Project \nare described in Appendix 8.  \n \n1.  Component 1: Improving the Policies, Laws, and Regulations for Land \nDegradation Control \n \n2.  Three broad outcomes will be pursued; details are in Supplementary Appendix D.1 \n \n3.  Developing Procedures and Mechanisms to Improve Law and Policy Quality and \nImplement Integrated Ecosystem Management. Six related work areas will assess, develop, \nand recommend (i) a comprehensive legislative and ecological elements toolbox for legal, policy, \nand institutional arrangements for land degradation (LD) management, including the toolbox\u2019s \ncomputerization;2 (ii) standard provincial procedures, based on best practices covering involved \norganizations,  land  management,  community  participation,  financing  arrangements,  and \nregulatory and nonregulatory approaches enforcement; (iii) harmonized laws, regulations, and \npolicies covering grasslands and desertification issues; water and soil conservation; water, \nforestry,  agriculture,  and  land  administration;  environment  protection;  and  assessment  of \nenvironmental  impact;  (iv)  capacity  building  for  laws  and  policies  implementation  and \nsurveillance,  focusing  on  developing  (a)  interagency  coordination  mechanisms  for  decision \nmaking that are applicable to the Eleventh Five-Year Plan in each province and region; (b) \necosystem  function  zones  procedures,  to  be  integrated  with  other  zones  used  in  different \nsectors, and procedures to be implemented under the environmental impact assessment (EIA) \nlaw; and (c) mechanisms to examine implementation and monitoring effectiveness; (v) EIA\u2019s \nrole in LD control through practical procedures under the EIA law; and (vi) legal procedures for \nprivate sector involvement, including land tenure; land use rights; gender rights and market \naccess; compensation measures for grassland closure; and preparation of measures to address \nsustainable livelihoods in consideration of poverty alleviation, minority groups, and gender rights. \n \n4.  The six activities mentioned in para. 3 will be implemented jointly at the central and \nprovincial  and/or  regional  level.  At  the  central  level,  the  consultant  team  will  comprise \ninternational legislative experts, central-level legislative experts, and various provincial-level \nexperts. This team will be responsible for reviewing and assessing primary legislative materials \nand developing legislative procedures and mechanisms. Provincial legislative experts will be \nresponsible for implementing the centrally developed procedures and mechanisms through \nvarious instructive workshops and introducing the procedures into the day-to-day legislative, \nregulatory, and policy operational programs. The capacity-building program and the training \nworkshops for legislative officials will be implemented at the central level and supervised by the \nconsultant team. The background material and course modules will be developed at the central \nlevel.  The  provincial-level  legal  training  workshops  will  be  implemented  conjunctively  by \ndomestic legal experts and newly trained provincial legislative experts. The central level will be \nresponsible for the international visits, special legislative education, and individual skills training.   \n                                                 \n1\n Component 1\u2019s design and implementation arrangements reflect a systematic approach and the recommendations \nmade in ADB. 2002.

See footnote 34, main text. ", "48  Appendix 6    \n5.  Building Capacity in Legislative and Policy Aspects. The following three linked work \nareas will be undertaken: (i) Prepare a comprehensive capacity-building program with legislative, \npolicy,  and  institutional  measures  to  train  key  target  groups,  including  legal  officers,  legal \ndraftsmen, judicial officials, policy makers, government officials, and private individuals at the \ncentral,  provincial,  and  regional  levels.  (ii)  Implement  training  workshops  at  central  and \nprovincial levels on integrated ecosystem management\u2019s legal role, LD studies\u2019 legal aspects, \npolicy and law links establishment, EIA, and judicial and legislative remedies access. These \nworkshops will be provided through a People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) institution with a \nrecognized capacity and include the training of trainers and relevant materials and presentations \npreparation.3  (iii) A program of international visits, tours, and secondments for selected officials \nthat will focus on innovative and relevant environmental laws and policies. \n \n6.  Policy, Advice, and Problem Solving Support.  A legal and policy advisory group, \ncomprising representatives of all involved provinces and/or regions and the central Government, \nwill be formed to guide implementation, including field visits and monitoring. A feasibility study \nwill be undertaken to examine the need for a permanent capacity for environmental law training \nin dryland areas and identify the most cost-effective option for delivering such training. Special \nstudies will be undertaken to assist with legal reform.4  \n \n7.  The final four activities (paras. 5 and 6) will be managed at the central level, with \nextensive consultation among provincial experts and government and academic institutions, \naccording to the nature of the problem being investigated. Management responsibility for the \nlegal and policy expert advisory group will be at the central level, with some provincial financial \nsupport. The implementation of training workshops will be managed at the central level, with \ninvolvement of provincial officials and experts from various environmental law institutions and \ngovernment agencies. Development of the toolbox as a computer-based expert system will be a \ncentral-level responsibility. \n \n  2.  Component 2: Strengthening National and Provincial Coordination \n \n8.  This component will ensure that the forthcoming Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010) \nreflects greater sector plan harmonization and introduces integrated ecosystem management \napproaches and budget allocation rationalization in the involved provinces and/or regions. To \nhighlight  the  principles  of  integrated  ecosystem  management  and  promote  mutual \nunderstanding among stakeholders of the concepts, key problems and root causes of LD, an \ninternational workshop will be held in the first year of implementation. The workshop will (i) aim \nto assist policy makers as they work to better understand LD causes internationally and in the \nPRC and help them understand what worked, what did not work, and why; (ii) involve all key \nstakeholders and help identify their views of proposed interventions and phasing; and (iii) assist \nin developing specific and regional guidelines for the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, which will be \nissued in September 2005.5 \n \n9.  A  planning  expert  group  will  be  formed,  comprising  representatives  of  all  involved \nagencies.  The  group  will  guide  the  implementation  of  components  2,  3,  4,  and  6.

Component 2 will be implemented under the supervision and guidance of the national \ninstitutions and planning expert group.6 This group will receive support and technical assistance \nfor  the  implementation  of  specific  component  activities  from  a  panel  of  international  and \ndomestic consultants. Consultants will be appointed based on their disciplinary expertise and \nknowledge of the institutional circumstances and planning needs for LD control within western \nPRC. At the national and provincial levels, a series of institutional stakeholder consultations \nand/or  consensus-building  meetings  will  be  held  to  reach  agreement  on  new  intersector \ncoordination mechanisms for promoting an integrated ecosystem management approach to LD \ncontrol. \n \n3.  Component 3: Improving Operational Arrangements at Provincial and/or \nAutonomous Region and County Levels \n \n11.  Component 3 will enhance the capacities of provincial and county agencies to work with \nrural communities in bottom-up participatory planning and in implementing field-level LD control \nthrough  an  integrated  ecosystem  management  approach.  Under  planning  expert  group \nguidance, other activities will include assessing existing operational arrangements, institutional \ncapacity,  and  training  needs;  identifying  field-level  best  practices;  developing  integrated \necosystem management guidelines, manuals, and materials for training; and demonstrating \ncommunity-based LD control in a minimum of three selected areas per province or region. A \nminimum of 10 adaptive research grants will be provided, on a competitive basis, for research \nagencies to conduct participatory research and use participatory technologies in combating LD. \nA public awareness campaign on the integrated ecosystem management approach will be \nundertaken; and workshops on community-based LD control, tours and/or exchanges for study, \nand publications will be supported. Details are provided in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n12.

It will consist of 8\u201310 members selected according to their knowledge of (i) LD control \ninstitutions, (ii) eleventh 5-year plans processes, (iii) intersector strategic planning, (iv) field-level LD control \nplanning, and (v) investment projects design. The group would be expected to meet formally four to six times per \nyear (depending on need) for 4 years. In addition, for this output, individual members and/or subgroups will conduct \ndetailed investigations into specific aspects of the strategic planning process, reporting back to the group as a \nwhole. \n7\n This is the same expert group guiding the implementation of components 2, 4, and 6.

Individual consultants will be appointed based on their disciplinary \nexpertise and knowledge of institutional circumstances and planning needs for LD control within \nwestern PRC.  \n \n4.  Component  4:  Capacity  Development  for  Land  Degradation  Investment \nProjects \n \n13.  Developing the capacity to design, implement, and finance future investment projects, \nbased on an integrated ecosystem management approach to combating LD is a major element \nof the Project. In each province and region, the approach will (i) identify training needs; (ii) \nexamine the impact of past LD investments (accurate feedback on the impacts, benefits, and \nefficiencies of different types of interventions); and (iii) undertake feasibility studies of integrated \necosystem management project investments. These studies will cover high-priority investment \nprojects for possible ADB, GEF, or other development agency financing under the PRC-GEF \nPartnership.8 To identify potential financing for these future investments, a study of cofinancing \noptions will be undertaken to identify one or more modalities for combining loan financing, GEF \ngrants,  other  concessional  resources,  and  government  support.  An  operational cofinancing \nmodality is a precondition for each province and region to benefit from potential investments \nunder the Partnership. Supplementary Appendix G provides further details. \n \n14.  All activities will take place at the provincial and/or regional level. Provincial experts will \nbe involved with support from the international consultants engaged under the Project in (i) \nproviding assistance with terms of reference for the studies; and (ii) guiding scheduling, scope, \nand reporting arrangements. Coordination with potential development agencies will be done by \nthe project coordination office (PCO) in the Ministry of Finance. \n \n5.  Component 5: Monitoring and Evaluation System for Land Degradation \n \n15.  Component 5\u2019s major outputs will be (i) a national coordination mechanism for collecting, \nsharing,  and  analyzing  LD-related  data;  (ii)  the  clarification  of  provincial-  and  county-level \nagency roles and mechanisms that will contribute to national-level LD assessments; (iii) a \nuniversally agreed definition of LD, including common definitions of specific LD types (e.g., wind \nerosion,  water  erosion,  soil  fertility  decline,  and  biodiversity  loss);  common  standards  and \nindicators for national-level monitoring of specific LD types; and compatible software programs \nand standards that will facilitate sharing of data sets. Supplementary Appendix H provides \nfurther details. \n \n16.  Activities will be guided by an advisory group on LD monitoring and evaluation. The \ngroup will comprise experts from established participating main agencies. Activities will include \nestablishing  a  geographic  information  system  at  each  province  and  region;  training  in  LD \nassessment; developing indicators for monitoring LD; and conducting related workshops, study \ntours,  and  exchange  visits.  At  the  national,  provincial,  and  regional  levels,  a  series  of \ninstitutional stakeholder consultation and consensus-building meetings will be held to reach \nagreement on new mechanisms for coordinating and sharing the collection and analysis of \nnational-level LD datasets. At the community level, the direct stakeholders (including farmers, \nforesters, herders, and other land users) will be involved in pilot monitoring and assessment \nstudies, participating actively in assessing the nature, severity, and impact of LD in their areas. \nProven programs and techniques for assessing and monitoring LD in the PRC will be supported, \n                                                 \n8\n ADB programmed several project preparation technical assistance and subsequent loans for future investments. \nThe agreed project eligibility criteria are given in Supplementary Appendix G.

Background and Rationale \n \n1.  The People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has massive ongoing programs and projects to \ncombat land degradation (LD) at national, regional, and provincial levels. Successive recent \nfive-year plan expenditures on LD have rapidly grown in support of forestry, agriculture, water, \nand  land  (administered  by  sector  through  each  relevant  agency).  Yet,  despite  increased \nresources and some implementation success, physical indicators of LD are worsening, land \nproductivity is falling, and habitats and biodiversity are lost, especially in the fragile drylands of \nthe  impoverished  western  region.  Poverty  reduction-oriented  programs  are  often  handled \nseparately and not integrated within the major technical programs to address environmental \nrehabilitation.  The  Government  has  acknowledged  that  LD  is  increasing  and  endorses  an \nintegrated  approach  for  the  future,  based  on  the  successful  experiences  of  overcoming \necosystem degradation in many countries and in parts of the PRC.  A structured implementation \napproach, backed up by political leadership is vital (Figure 1). \n \nFigure1: Administrative Structure for Project Implementation1  \n \n \n  Advisory Groups \nCentral Steering Committee\n  1.

The Government has sought international assistance in successfully completing over 30 \nprevious projects dealing with LD. However, under the Project, a complex reform agenda will be \npursued that requires close collaboration between 11 agencies and 6 provinces and/or regions. \n                                                 \n1\n  Universities and academic institutes have played an important role during project preparation and will be involved \nin project implementation in various ways, including authoring contracts; participating in advisory groups; and \npreparing case studies, feasibility studies, and training courses. Central-level universities include Beijing Normal, \nWuhan,  Shanghai  Jiaotong,  Peking,  Remin,  China  Agricultural,  and  Beijing  Forestry;  and  institutes  include \nGeography  and  Resources,  Remote  Sensing,  Ecological  and  Environmental  Research,  and  China  Ecology \nResearch Network of Chinese Academy of Science (CAS). Provincial-level institutes include Xinjiang Institute of \nEcology and Geography, and Cold and Arid Regions Environmental and Engineering Research Institute (Lanzhou, \nGansu) of CAS. Provincial universities include Northwest Agricultural and Forestry Science and Technology (Xian, \nShaanxi), Gansu Agricultural, Inner Mongolia Agricultural, and others. ", "Appendix 8  57 \nExperience of previous Asian Development Bank (ADB) technical assistance has shown that \nsector agencies were often reluctant to effectively collaborate with other agencies or share \ninformation or welcome ideas that implied thinking beyond agency-specific boundaries.2 To \novercome these problems and effectively institute an integrated ecosystem management (IEM) \napproach will require a number of reforms, including institutionalizing a multiagency structure, \nparticipatory methods, and the development of a phased and regularly reviewed implementation \nmethodology at the central, provincial, and regional levels. The development partner community \nhas indicated its support for the Partnership; significant financial commitment, however, requires \nimproved development partner coordination and new financial modalities for combining loan and \ngrant resources. \n \nB.  Approach to Project Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Objectives and Outputs \n \n4.  The  objectives  are  to  (i)  set  up  a  fully  functioning  coordination  and  project \nimplementation capacity at the central level and in each of the six participating province and/or \nregions; (ii) actively support implementation of all components and ensure proactive links are \nestablished and information is shared with all complementary projects, research agencies, and \nprograms; (iii) improve development partner coordination; and (iv) conduct program monitoring \nand evaluation.  \n \n2.  Key Activities by Output \n \na.  Central Level \n \n5.  National  Steering  Committee.  This  committee  coordinates  the  major  agencies.3 It \ncomprises senior officials from National Development and Reform Commission; Ministry of \nFinance (MOF); Ministry of Agriculture; Ministry of Science and Technology; Ministry of Water \nResources; Ministry of Land and Resources; State Environment Protection Administration; State \nForestry Administration (SFA); Chinese Academy of Sciences; and Legislative Affairs Office of \nthe State Council, Legislative Work Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress. The Steering \nCommittee is chaired by the Vice-Chair, Committee of Population, Resources and Environment, \nChinese  People\u2019s  Political  Consultative  Conference.  ADB  will  regularly  meet  the  Steering \nCommittee to review major milestones and progress. Four advisory groups (i.e., policy and legal \nframework, LD monitoring and evaluation, institutional coordination and IEM) will assist the \nSteering Committee. \n \n6.  Project Coordination Office (PCO).  Headed by the Director General, Department of \nInternational Cooperation in MOF, the central PCO will (i) report to the Steering Committee; (ii) \nundertake liaison with Global Environment Facility, ADB, and international organizations; (iii) \ncoordinate  central  agencies  dealing,  specifically  with  interagency  issues;  and  (iv)  provide \nguidance  to  the  project  management  office  (PMO),  through  monitoring  of  progress.  The \n                                                 \n2\n The completion report for TA 3657-PRC: PRC-GEF Partnership on Land Degradation in Dryland Ecosystems, \nconcluded that it is difficult for any PRC sector agency to coordinate with other sector agencies in a multisector \napproach to combating LD. A genuine multiagency implementation structure needs to be put in place. The \nGovernment has taken positive steps toward strengthening interagency coordination and full-time management for \nimplementation  of  the  country  programming  framework  (CPF).  As  this  work  is  staff-intensive,  ADB  has \nstrengthened its staffing at the resident mission in Beijing to support the implementation of the CPF.  \n3\n The Office of the Leading Group for Western Region Development of the State Council is a key agency for LD in \nthe western region but was not yet included in the Steering Committee of the Project. It is anticipated that this office \nwill become one of the agencies involved in the Partnership.  ", "58  Appendix 8 \nmembers of the PCO will represent each of the agencies that are represented on the Steering \nCommittee.  In  each  province  and/or  region  the  respective  finance  bureau  will  head  the \nprovincial PCO and report to the vice-governor. The PCO will have four staff members on a full-\ntime basis. \n \n7.  Project Management Office. The PMO is headed by the Deputy Director General, \nDepartment  of  Science  and  Technology,  SFA.  It  comprises  representatives  of  the  same \nagencies as represented on the Steering Committee and the PCO. The PMO will be responsible \nfor  (i)  developing  the  annual  work  plan  and  implementation  arrangements,  with  ADB  and \nconsultant support; (ii) management of all project components, including contract management \nand related activities; (iii) day-to-day implementation and guidance to the provincial PMOs; (iv) \nfinancial management of funds disbursed by MOF from the central imprest account into the \ncentral PMO accounts, which are to be used for the activities specified in the approved work \nplans (ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects \nFinanced by ADB will be taken into account); (v) quarterly newsletter and regular Website \nmaintenance, keeping development partner programs on LD and/or poverty, project profiles, \nlinks to technical sites, updates on government policies and legislation, news releases, and \nmedia  releases  via  TV;  and  (vi)  monitoring  environmental  developments  in  the  PRC  and \noverseas from domestic and international sources for Website postings. The PMO will also \nassist  the  provincial  PMOs  in  managing  the  funds  released  by  MOF  into  their  respective \nprovincial imprest accounts for the agreed provincial work plans. It will also support the advisory \ngroups, including work planning, reports, and schedules. The full-time staff of the PMO will \ncomprise six people. Four part-time employees will also work at the PMO. These individuals will \nbe recruited from participating agencies or by contract. The PMO office was set up in 2002 and \nmoved to the Debao Hotel in November 2003, with two full-time staff members and 3 part-time \nstaff members. The central PCO and PMO share common office facilities in the Debao Hotel in \nBeijing. A Chinese language Website (www.op12.cn) has been established, and the first CPF \nnewsletter was published and circulated widely in February 2004. \n \nb.  Provincial Level \n \n8.  Provincial Leading Groups.4 Headed by the relevant vice-governor or vice-chairperson, \nthese groups comprise senior officials from provincial development and planning commissions, \ndepartments  of  finance,  departments  of  water  resources,  departments  of  agriculture, \ndepartments of land resources, science and technology commissions, environmental protection \nbureaus,  forestry  bureaus,  poverty  alleviation  offices,  and  legislative  affairs  offices.  These \ngroups will be responsible for overall internal coordination within each specific province and/or \nregion, as per the Steering Committee at the central level. Provincial leading groups will confirm \nplans  proposed  in  project  documents,  coordinate  multiagency  affairs  during  project \nimplementation, and review progress. Potential links between central and provincial tasks will be \nensured through these groups.  \n \n9.  Provincial Coordination. At provincial level, coordination offices were established in \nprovincial departments of finance to undertake multiagency coordination and report to vice-\ngovernors through the Provincial Leading Meeting. A close and active connection with the \ncentral PCO and PMO is needed for effective information exchange. Provincial PCOs are \nheaded by provincial departments of finance section-related directors at the deputy director \n                                                 \n4\n During the TA Fact-Finding Mission, five of six vice-governors or equally high-ranking officials were met. In all six \nprovinces and/or regions, high-level commitment was indicated, and there is no doubt that strong political support \nexists for the Project and for the future investment projects that are expected to follow. ", "Appendix 8  59 \ngeneral level of relevant agencies covering legislative, planning, finance, environment, land, \nwater resources, forestry, animal husbandry, and grasslands.  \n \n10.  Provincial Management Offices. At the provincial level, implementation units were set \nup with similar arrangements and representation as the central level. Provincial forestry bureaus \nwill be responsible for day-to-day implementation issues, including administrative and technical \nsupport,  meetings,  workshops,  study  tours,  and  field  trips  facilitating,  and  information \ndissemination. Provincial PMOs will take overall direction from the PCOs and maintain close \nlinks with the central level.  \n \nc.  Coordination between Central and Provincial Levels \n \n11.  The central PCO will play a key role in this regard. Several times annually regular \nmeetings will be held with the head of each provincial leading group. These will be priority \nchannels to strengthen such coordination. With the assistance of provincial PCOs, the central \nPCO needs mission responsible senior officials of relevant agencies and ADB to meet with \nleading groups. Sector reaction on specific fields vertically between central and provincial level \nis  needed  in  the  meantime  to  facilitate  integration  of  national  projects  with  the  PRC-GEF \nPartnership, which has to be regulated and committed through a central steering meeting. \n \nd.  Expert Advisory Groups \n \n12.  Four advisory groups, namely legislative and policy group, planning and institutions \ngroup, LD monitoring and evaluation group, and IEM group will be set up to provide national \noversight  and  guidance  for  the  implementation  of  the  proposed  activities  and  support  the \nprovincial expert groups as they facilitate the implementation of specific activities and tasks.5 \n \n13.  Legal  and  Policy  Group.  This  will  comprise  members  with  extensive  policy  and \nlegislative knowledge and provide high-level guidance, rapid support, and coordination for the \nimplementation of the activities and tasks of component 1. The group will meet four times a \nyear.  Counterpart  groups  may  also  be  established  in  each  province  to  facilitate  the \nimplementation of specific activities.  \n \n14.  Planning and Institutions Group. This group will provide guidance and coordination for \nthe implementation of proposed activities and tasks of components 2, 3, and 4. It will meet up to \nsix times per year (especially in the early years). It will discuss and document institutional and \nplanning  issues,  formulate  proposals  and  options  for  improved  intersector  institutional \ncoordination  and  collaboration  mechanisms  at  the  national  and  provincial  levels,  facilitate \nperiodic interagency consensus-building meetings, and direct the process toward achieving final \nagreement between the concerned institutions on new intersector coordination and collaboration \nmechanisms for LD and other related matters. \n \n15.  LD Monitoring and Evaluation Group. Group members will be selected according to \ntheir specific knowledge of the methods and national datasets for assessing one or more LD \n                                                 \n5 Each expert group will comprise 8\u201310 members selected according to their specific knowledge of relevant areas. \nEach member should be a nationally recognized expert in his/her particular field. Each expert would also act as the \nrepresentative of a key institution with regard to reporting on its mandate, role, and responsibilities for LD control. \nThe chair of each expert group should have sufficient seniority be able to act as a neutral mediator in resolving any \ndifferences of opinion between individual experts and their institutions. Each member would enter into a contract to \nserve on the expert panel and undertake the expected duties and responsibilities. In return for these services, an \nhonorarium would be made. ", "60  Appendix 8 \ntypes, to guide implementation of component 5. The group will discuss and document what is \ncurrently being done in the PRC with regard to the collection of LD-related data, formulating \nproposals and options for a national LD monitoring and coordination network, reviewing reports \ncarried out by consultants, facilitating the holding of periodic interagency consensus-building \nmeetings and directing the process toward achieving final agreement, and presenting project \nfindings on LD monitoring and evaluation. \n \n16.  Integrated Ecosystem Management Group.  This group will use the recommendations \narising from the other groups and also from project experience overseas and in the PRC to \nadvise provincial and/or autonomous region officials on best practices. See Appendix 11. \n \n    e.  Development Partner Coordination \n \n17.  To assist in addressing various aspects of LD, development partners have actively \nsupported innovative approaches for many years, often adopting a socioeconomic approach, \nand  not  solely  an  environmental  approach.  While  these  projects  have  been  generally \nsuccessfully  implemented  and  assisted  in  overcoming  poverty  and  rehabilitating  degraded \necosystems,  very  few  innovations  have  been  incorporated  into  national  approaches.  Four \ndevelopment  partner  roundtables  have  been  held  at  PRCM  during  the  design  phase.  An \ninnovative mechanism is needed to bridge the administrative divide that separates multilateral \nfinanced projects (MOF) from bilateral financed projects (Ministry of Commerce). ADB has taken \na lead in development partner coordination during the design phase, but this will shift to the \nGovernment during implementation. Close links will be set up with environmental assistance \nprograms (e.g., China Council for International Cooperation in Environment and Development). \n \n    f.  Work Plans and Budgets \n \n18.  For each component, tasks, activities, and annual targets will be captured in a work plan \nand budget to be agreed early in each year. The PCO and/or PMO, supported by their provincial \ncounterparts and consultants, will play a lead role in preparing the work plan. Components 1 \nand 5 require the central Government to take a lead role, as the legal framework and LD \nmonitoring are central functions. Components 2, 3, 4, and 6 (national and provincial institutional \ncoordination, operational arrangements at provincial and county levels, improved institutional \ncapacity for IEM investments, and implementation arrangements) require commitment at central \nand provincial levels, but implementation will largely be at provincial and/or regional levels. \n \nC.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n19.  After the first year of implementation, a comprehensive joint review will be undertaken of \nthe progress toward the first year targets. The most important of these include (i) the inception \nmission to commence the Project; (ii) an international workshop on the IEM approach; (iii) a \nmore coordinated approach to LD being included in the specific and regional plans for the \nEleventh Five-Year Plan; (iv) an innovative modality for development partner cofinancing of LD \nprojects  on  the  IEM  approach  has  been  agreed  to  use  PRC-GEF  Partnership  funds;  (v) \nfeasibility studies are underway for several of these projects, incorporating GEF-eligible projects; \n(vi) staffing and full functioning of the PCO and PMO; (vii) the work plan for the first year has \nbeen implemented successfully. Following the comprehensive review at the end of the first year, \na decision will be taken regarding the direction of future implementation. Future annual joint \nreviews will also be undertaken to provide feedback and guide implementation progress. \n ", "Table A8: Implementation Schedule\nProject Year\nComponent Activities and Key Tasks\n1 2 3 4\nA.

The  key  outputs  will  be  advice,  reports,  and \nrecommendations on (i) best practices for integrated ecosystem management approaches to \ncombating  LD,  including  setting  up  an  integrated  ecosystem  management  expert  group, \nconsisting of domestic experts, to promote networking among PRC scientists, researchers, and \norganizations and advise on project implementation; (ii) results of past LD interventions; (iii) \nplanning of studies, workshops, seminars, and training programs; (iv) international scientific \nlinks to ongoing LD-relevant programs and projects; (v) identification of relevant projects and \nprograms in the PRC and overseas; and (vii) compliance with appropriate ADB safeguard \npolicies, including a minority peoples plan.  \n \n  2.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n3.  The  TA  will  provide  consultancy  services  in  work  scheduling,  monitoring,  and \ncoordination. It will also support compliance with ADB and GEF reporting requirements and \nsafeguard policies of the Project and the overall CPF. The consultants will work in five of the six \nproject components, namely, (i) improving the policy, laws, and regulations for LD control; (ii) \nstrengthening national and provincial coordination; (iii) improving operational arrangements at \nprovincial  and  county  levels;  (iv)  developing  capacity  for  LD  investment  projects;  and  (v) \nmonitoring and evaluation system for LD.  \n \n3.  Implementation Arrangements and Scope \n \n4.  The TA will require about 19 person-months of international and about 103 person-\nmonths  of  domestic  consulting  expertise.  Specializations  required  are  environmental  law, \ninstitutions, dryland ecosystems management, participatory planning, LD project design, LD \nassessment, and LD dataset coordination. Flexibility in the expertise required will be necessary \nto respond to priorities as the TA progresses.  \n \n5.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be the Ministry of Finance (MOF), which is also the \nExecuting Agency for the overall CPF. The consultants will support the project coordination \noffice (PCO), the project management office (PMO), and the three advisory groups financed \nunder the Project and work collaboratively with the consultants financed by GEF (Appendix 10). \nConsultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of ", "Appendix 11  71 \nConsultants, and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. The TA is expected to commence in July 2004 and be completed by July 2007 (36 \nmonths).  Implementation  will  be  guided  by  annual  work  plans  and  reports  to  be  regularly \nreviewed in meetings with the Steering Committee for the overall Project, GEF, and ADB. MOF \nwill prepare the final report. The engagement of consultants may be through consulting firms or \nindividuals on the basis of a simplified technical proposal. Quality- and cost-based selection will \nbe used. \n \n  4.  Costs \n \n6.  The total cost of the TA is shown in Table A11.1. ADB will provide $1 million to cover all \nforeign exchange costs ($507, 500) and 71% of local currency costs ($492,500) equivalent. The \nADB TA will cover international and domestic consultants, international and domestic travel and \nrelated reporting, office operations, and communication costs.

Poverty Alleviation Strategies. The People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s (PRC\u2019s) success in \nreducing poverty reflects sustained rapid economic growth, mainstreaming poverty reduction \nefforts, and significant budget allocations for poverty reduction initiatives in the past decade.1 In \nMay 2001, the PRC adopted a 10-year poverty strategy identifying key counties for poverty \nreduction  and  development,  to  assist  30  million  rural  people  with  incomes  under  the \nGovernment\u2019s official poverty line of CNY625 per capita annual income. Another 60 million rural \npeople with per capita annual incomes below CNY865 are vulnerable to falling into absolute \npoverty. Using the most common measures for international comparisons of poverty,2 $1 per \nday income (the Millennium Development Goal) and $1 day expenditure, 97 million people \n(10.5%  of  the  rural  population)  and  235  million  people  (25.5%  of  the  rural  population), \nrespectively, would be poor in 1999 (Figure A15). The rate of decline has slowed, due partly to \ndeclining agricultural prices. \n \nFigure A15: Trends in Poverty in Rural Areas  \n \n400 official number of rural\npoor(million) with\ns) 350 income of less than\nn $0.67/day\no\nmilli 300\nn  250\noor (i 200 npouomrb(meri lloiof nru) rwailth\np\ner of  150 cthoanns u$m1/pdtaioyn of less\nb\nm 100\nu\nN\n50 number of rural\npoor(million) with\n0\nincome of less than\n1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 $1/day\nYear\n \nSource: World Bank. 2003. Country Assistance Strategy for PRC. Washington, DC. \n \n2.   The Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategies and targets are contained in the Tenth \nFive-Year Plan (2001\u20132005) and the Outline for Poverty Alleviation and Development of China's \nRural  Areas  (2001\u20132010).  The  PRC\u2019s  new  approach  is  area-  and  group-focused,  with  an \nemphasis on providing social and economic infrastructure and creating opportunities for the \npoor  to  increase  their  income.  To  improve  the  targeting  of  poverty  reduction  programs, \nparticipatory  processes  are  being  used  to  identify  poor  villages.3 The  Government  now \nwelcomes  a  greater  role  of  nongovernment  organizations  and  associated  participatory \napproaches. \n \n3.  Poverty Counties in the Six Provinces and/or Regions Covered by the Project. In \n2001,  the  Government  redefined  poverty  counties.  The  breakdown  of  poverty  counties  by \n                                                 \n1\n  For a full discussion on poverty, refer to ADB. 2003. PRC Poverty Profile. Manila. \n2\n  The PRC has not participated in the international surveys necessary to estimate the purchasing power parity. ADB \nis providing assistance in this area to the PRC and other developing member countries (RETA 6088).  \n3\n  ADB supported the development of this methodology under TA 3610. \n   ", "76  Appendix 12 \nprovince  and/or  region  is  Gansu  (43),  Inner  Mongolia  (31),  Ningxia  Hui  (8),  Qinghai  (15), \nShaanxi (50), and Xinjiang Uygur (27). This breakdown accounts for a total of 174 of the nations \n592 poverty counties (29%). In Gansu and Xinjiang Uygur, the proportion of people living below \nthe $1 per day income line is 23% and 27%, respectively. The capacity of these counties to \nfinance their own development and expand the infrastructure and economic base is limited. \n \n4.  Poverty and Ethnicity. In 2000, the population of ethnic groups in the western region \nwas 76.5 million, or 21.5% of the total population in the west and 71.9% of the total minority \npopulation  nationwide. 4  Appendix  4,  paragraph  10  describes  the  poverty  and  ethnicity \nrelationship for the areas covered by the project. 5 \n \n5.  Rural Policies and Poverty. Production-oriented policies initiated in the early 1980s \nhave strongly influenced land management in rural localities in the western region. Impacts \ninclude (i) a widening income gap between the better-off and poorest groups over the past 20 \nyears.6 More wasteland is also being cultivated by farmers, in order to increase production to \npay for education, medical, and tax expenses. Lack of stable land-use rights by farmers in the \nwestern  region  also  contributes  to  excessive  cultivation  that,  in  turn,  exacerbates  land \ndegradation (LD). Official migration for agriculture in the ecologically fragile western region has \noften contributed to LD. For example, near Qinghai Lake, the degraded landscape is a source of \nseasonal dust storms. \n \n6.   Population Growth and Poverty. The rates of natural population increase are higher \nthan the averages in four out of six project provinces and/or regions. Local populations have \ngrown faster in some localities, where land has become severely degraded or where ethnic-\ndominant populations live. Between 1980 and 2000, for example, the total population of Ningxia \nHui increased from 3.7 million to 5.5 million, a growth rate of 48.3% in 20 years. However, the \npopulation of the Hui minority in Ningxia Hui increased from 1.2 million to 1.9 million, an \nincrease of 63.6% during the same period.7 The enrollment rate of girls at school is lower than \nthat of boys, and some girls do not attend school at all, for religious reasons.8 The school \ndropout rate for girls in poor families is higher than that of boys, and the gap increases with age. \n \n7.  Poverty and Institutional Issues. Despite recent central policies (para. 2), institutional \nfragmentation has adverse effects on the effectiveness of poverty alleviation and LD control \nprograms.  Provincial  poverty  alleviation  offices  have  direct  responsibility  for  program \nimplementation, but they are largely ineffective, as responsibilities are spread over several \ngovernment departments, leading to coordination difficulties. In the forestry sector, for example, \nthere is no effective mechanism that enables poverty alleviation initiatives to be integrated into \nthe ecological construction programs of provincial forestry bureaus. Poverty alleviation agencies \ninadequately participate in the transformation of farmland to forests and grasslands projects and \nthe choice of counties where programs will be applied.9 \n                                                 \n4\n State Bureau of Statistics. 2001. \n5\n Zhao, Xi. 2001. Research on the Hard Points and Strategic Choices of Rural Poverty-Relief in the West of China. \nBeijing: Southwestern Finance University Press.  \n6\n For example, in poor areas of Inner Mongolia, 30% of wealthy families own more than 70% of all sheep. Interview \nwith  the  Director,  Poverty-Relief  Office,  Tongliao  Municipality,  Inner  Mongolia  and  Department  of  Regional \nEconomic Development, State Development and Planning Commission. \n7 Ningxia Almanac. 2001.  \n8\n Information provided by the Women\u2019s Research Institute. \n9\n Three types of poverty relief funds are managed by three different government agencies: (i) the employment-\nreplaces-aid fund is managed by the National Development and Reform Commission; (ii) a special poverty-relief \n ", "Appendix 12   77 \n8.  Poverty and Financial Services. The rural credit cooperatives are the main formal \nfinancial service for the rural sector. However, these cooperatives have many weaknesses, \nincluding weak management and high nonperforming loans. Farmers can arrange small, short-\nterm loans in spring each year to buy fertilizers, seeds, and tools, but loans need to be repaid in \nautumn, following the sale of crops. Repayments are delayed when crop failure occurs, because \nof droughts or disease losses. Poor households have particular difficulty in gaining access to \nfinancial  services.  In  key  poverty  counties,  the  central  Government  has  provided  poverty \nalleviation loans, but these are not easily accessible by poor households nor are they well \nknown. A conclusion of a series of interviews during project preparation was that most poor \nfarmers  did  not  know  about  poverty  alleviation  loans.10 Although  the  Ministry  of  Finance \nprovides  funds  to  the  Agriculture  Bank  of  China\u2019s  headquarters  to  subsidize  poverty  loan \ninterest rates, these funds are typically used for infrastructure or agrobusiness, rather than for \nlivelihood-oriented purposes. The Agriculture Bank of China has also closed many county and \ntownship branches in its transition to a commercial bank. \n \n9.  Land Degradation and Poverty. The poor become increasingly vulnerable where their \nlocal biophysical environment has deteriorated. Women suffer more than men from LD in terms \nof health, nutrition, employment, and income. Almost one half of all counties in the PRC that are \necologically fragile are located in the western region, where the link between poverty and \necological fragility is most striking. In such areas, vulnerability to risks is high. Natural disasters \n(mainly prolonged drought) in recent years have resulted in a return of many communities to \npoverty. Nearly 20 million people live in absolute poverty in the target provinces and/or regions, \nand a large number have incomes that are just above the poverty line. When wealthy farmers \nplace unsustainable pressure upon land because they graze large sheep flocks, poorer families \nhave no option but to rely on locally cut firewood or straw for cooking and heating, cutting grass \nfor animal fodder, and collecting medicinal plants for own use and sale. Hetian Municipality in \nXinjiang Uygur is a typical poverty locality where the energy structure of farmers is mainly reliant \non crop straw, more than 60% of which is used as a household fuel, leaving the land surface \nbare and without recycling to maintain the organic and nutrient content of soil. Collectively, \nthese  activities  have  a  massive  and  destructive  impact  upon  vegetation  in  the  dryland \necosystems and contribute markedly to LD. \n \n10.  Summary  Poverty  Reduction  and  Social  Strategy.  Improving  land  management \nthrough an integrated ecosystem management approach to combating LD will lead to reduction \nof  poverty  over  time.  There  are  positive  examples  (see  Appendix  5  and  Supplementary \nAppendix E) of development agency-supported projects in the PRC that have successfully \nadopted  such  an  approach.  International  examples  also  point  to  long-term  ecosystem \nrehabilitation and sustainable land management in drylands. The problems in the project areas \nrequire a similar long-term approach. The social strategy will be integrated into the overall \napproach to implementation, especially at province and/or regional level, where the relevant \npoverty offices will be represented in the project management office. Elements will include \npoverty mapping and coordination within government programs and future investment projects. \nThe  Project  will  provide  for  participatory  consultations  with  villagers,  officials,  and  other \nstakeholders to develop a common understanding and demand-driven approaches to major \n                                                 \nfund is administered by the Agricultural Bank of China; and (iii) provincial poverty-relief agencies manage their own \npoverty-alleviation programs. Each agency has its own specific interests and its own terms and conditions.   \n10\n Interviews conducted during fieldwork in all 6 provinces/regions. Several international development organizations, \nnotably, UNDP, UNICEF, IFAD, and the World Bank have implemented pilot-scale micro-finance projects in the \nProject  areas,  in  which  small  loans  have  been  provided  to  poor  farmers  without  mortgage  or  guarantee \nrequirements. The experience is that these projects have sharply reduced the cost of borrowing in very poor rural \ncommunities. \n   ", "78  Appendix 12 \nissues.  Typical  priority  issues  relevant  to  reducing  poverty  and  improving  environmental \nmanagement, as will be pursued under future investment projects, may include the following: (i) \naccess to education and health care; (ii) access to improved rural financial services, including \nmicrofinance;  (iii)  environmental  protection  of  ecosystems  against  degradation  and \ndesertification;  (iv)  improved  data  on  poverty  incidence  and  environmental  aspects,  and \npromotion  of  local  awareness  of  sustainable  natural  resource  management;  (v)  balancing \nenvironmental protection laws on forestry, grasslands, and wildlife with traditional occupations, \nsuch as hunting and logging, and ensuring that minority cultures are not adversely impacted; (vi) \nstable irrigation systems and drinking water supply for villagers and livestock; (vii) improved \ntransport  systems  for  market  access,  information,  and  investment;  (viii)  advanced  skills  in \nlivestock raising, cash crops, agricultural and livelihood diversification, and marketing and group \nassociations to improve information and reduce hunting and damaging practices; (ix) improved \nhousing  and  rural  energy  supplies;  (x)  cultural  protection  through  bilingual  education;  (xi) \nbiodiversity conservation through ecotourism and conservation; and (xii) institutional capacity \ndevelopment, including nongovernment organizations and other local organizations. \n \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY FORM \n \nA.

Poverty Analysis   Proposed Classification \n \nThe six provinces and/or autonomous regions addressed by the project have a population of 117 million, \nincluding many of the country\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable people. Poverty is related to isolation and \nenvironmental degradation over many years as a result of primarily human-induced policies and actions. \nThe Project will promote greater awareness of the root causes of LD, ways to rehabilitate ecosystems and \npromote sustainable livelihoods, develop the capacity and coordination of institutions, and introduce the \ncapacity for participatory planning and development.  Poverty-related institutions will be integrated into the \nplanning process with technical, sector-based institutions in a more holistic approach to investment \nprojects to combat LD under the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010). Over the longer term, this will \nlead to a significant impact on poverty reduction through a more effective and multisector approach to \naddressing LD. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nStakeholders number in the tens of millions. They include local people, ethnic minorities, six provincial \nand/or regional governments, and central government agencies, including National Development and \nReform Commission, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Water Resources, Ministry of \nLand and Resources, State Environmental Protection Administration, Chinese Academy of Sciences, \nState Forestry Administration, Ministry of Science and Technology, Legislative Work Committee of the \nNational  People\u2019s  Congress,  and  Legislative  Affairs  Office  of  the  State  Council.  The  roles  and \nresponsibilities  have  been  analyzed  and  delineated.

Procedures for Minority Peoples Development Plan Preparation \n \n13.  In preparing MPDPs, the Executing Agencies (EA), through provincial or regional project \nmanagement offices (PMOs), will conduct social assessment surveys and develop baseline \ndata regarding affected groups and their livelihood and subsistence sources and community \n   ", "80  Appendix 12 \nnetworks; review policies and guidelines regarding minority peoples in relevant provinces or \nregions; (iii) undertake project-specific  MPDPs, when impacts are significant; and (iv) submit \ndraft and final MPDPs for ADB review and approval. Project components will not start before \nMPDP approval.  \n \nD.  Institutional Framework, Consultation, and Disclosure  \n  \n14.  EA will coordinate and finance MPDP preparation and prepare MPDPs and monitor \nimplementation; recruit local agencies or nongovernment organizations with experience working \namong minority peoples during MPDP planning, preparation, and implementation; and ensure \nthat  these agencies  or  organizations  are  familiar  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  requirements.  Affected \ngroups will be consulted during MPDP preparation. Before finalization, mitigation measures and \nstrategies will be presented to affected groups during community-level workshops. Prior to \nimplementation,  MPDPs  will  be  translated  into  local  languages  and  distributed  to  affected \nvillages. Minority affairs bureaus, poverty alleviation offices, All China\u2019s Women\u2019s Federation, \nand EA and participating agencies will be involved in MPDP implementation and related issues \nresolution.  \n \nE.  Budget and Source of Funding \n \n15.  The  preliminary  MPDP  budget  is  CNY300,000.  This  should  cover  preparation, \ndevelopment  measures  implementation  (to  be  determined),  and  monitoring  and  reporting. \nBudget  revision  follows  MPDP  preparation.  EA  will  ensure  that  budgets  are  adequate  to \nimplement  MPDPs. Supporting consultant services will be provided  through ADB technical \nassistance (Appendix 11). \n \nF.  Monitoring and Evaluation  \n \n16.  MPDP  implementation  will  be  monitored  internally  and  externally.  To  ensure \nparticipatory  monitoring,  PMOs  will  establish  biannual  monitoring  systems  involving \nimplementing staffs, implementing agencies or nongovernment organizations, minority peoples\u2019 \ngroups,  and  local  organizations.  Monitoring  indicators  will  be  determined  during  MPDP \nimplementation. Independent monitoring agencies or experts will carry out external monitoring. \nExternal monitoring investigations and reports will be conducted annually and submitted to \nexecuting agencies and ADB. Appropriate monitoring formats will be prepared for monitoring \nand reporting requirements.  \n \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20040705155039+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20040608133604+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R91-04", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)"}}
