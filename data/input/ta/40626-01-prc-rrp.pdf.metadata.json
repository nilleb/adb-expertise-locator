THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Yunnan Integrated Road Network Development \nProject.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n2.  The road network in Yunnan is relatively dense but only provides low levels of service to the \npopulation.2 This situation limits the contribution of roads to income earning, employment creation, \nand  poverty  reduction.  To  overcome  this  problem,  the  existing  road  infrastructure  must  be \nimproved  and  upgraded.  The  proposed  project  will  be  the  last  in  a  series  of  five  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) interventions to develop the National Expressway Network Plan (NENP) \nin Yunnan.3 It will also finance the rehabilitation of national and provincial highways, and introduce \nnew ways of maintaining rural roads. The project was included in the country partnership strategy, \n2008\u20132010 and the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) regional cooperation operations business \nplan, 2010\u20132012.4 It is designed to address both investment needs and sector performance issues, \nincluding road asset management.  \n \n3.  Yunnan is a mountainous landlocked province in southwestern PRC with a population of \n45.3 million. In 2008, its per capita gross domestic product was 55% of the national average; and it \nranked  third  lowest  among  the  country\u2019s  administrative  areas.  Because  of  its  remoteness, \ninvestment and expansion of nonfarm employment opportunities have lagged other provinces. \nRural poverty incidence is 15.2%. The lack of an efficient and effective transport system is an \nobstacle to inclusive growth in Yunnan.  \n \n4.  Road  is  the  most  widely  used  transport  mode  in  Yunnan,5 and  is  therefore  a  central \nenabling factor in economic development and reduction of poverty. The total road network reached \n203,753 kilometers (km) in 2008, of which less than 4% were class II or above (compared with \n10.7% nationally), 5% were class III, and the remaining 91% were class IV and unclassified. High \nclass tolled highways of class I and above (1% of the network) are managed by Yunnan Provincial \nHighway  Development  and  Investment  Company  (YHIC).  The  remainder  of  the  core  network \n(12%)6 is managed by the Yunnan Provincial Highway Bureau (YPHB). The rural road network \n(87%) is managed at the local level by prefectural and county communication bureaus (CCBs). \n \n5.  Need  to  expand  road  network  capacity  and  quality.  In  accordance  with  the  State \nCouncil\u2019s NENP approved in 2004, Yunnan is committed to improving its expressway network. One \nsection remains to be built to complete the NENP in western Yunnan and to realize the full benefit \nof the sections already financed by ADB. This is the Longling\u2013Ruili Expressway (LRE),7 the final \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Sector Assessment (Summary): Transport, and Information and Communication Technology (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2). The Problem Tree of the Project is accessible from the following weblink: \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/Concept-Papers/PRC/40626-01-prc-cp.pdf. \n3  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n4  ADB. 2008. Country Partnership Strategy: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2008\u20132010. Manila; and ADB. 2009. Regional \nCooperation Operations Business Plan: Greater Mekong Subregion, 2010\u20132012. Manila. \n5  The 2008 modal share for passenger-kilometers (km) was 66.3% for roads, 16.2% for railways, 0.3% for inland \nwaterways, and 17.2% for aviation. The modal share for freight ton-km was 57.8% for roads, 41.4% for railways, and \n0.8% for inland waterways. \n6  The core road network refers to the non-tolled ordinary national and provincial highways, which carry most of the \ntraffic in Yunnan. \n7  This project will link the western part of Yunnan province with Kunming and then Hangzhou (2,500 km in total). It will \nalso link with other GMS countries through the GMS Northern Corridor. ", "2   \nsection of the Hangrui (Hangzhou\u2013Ruili) corridor, one of the key east\u2013west corridors connecting \nthe PRC\u2019s lagging regions with its more prosperous eastern and coastal provinces. The existing \nLongling\u2013Ruili highway (G320), which passes through some hilly and mountainous terrain, carried \nan average traffic volume of 8,530 passenger car units (pcu) per day in 2008. The traffic volume \nvaries  along  this  highway\u2014from  above  14,600  pcu  per  day  around  Mangshi,  where  traffic \ncongestion is growing and the highway is likely to reach capacity by 2012, to about 5,000 pcu per \nday west of Ruili. The poor technical standard of the existing highway limits the average travel \nspeed to less than 40 km per hour, which cannot meet the rising transport demand and leads to a \nhigh incidence of road accidents. The LRE will complement two successfully completed ADB-\nfinanced  projects8 that  implemented  adjacent  sections  of  the  Hangrui  road  corridor.  When \ncompleted,  it  will  reduce  travel  time  and  transport  costs  considerably,  help  ease  congestion, \nreduce traffic accidents, provide increased opportunities for profitable farm and nonfarm economic \nactivities along the project road, and allow more efficient vehicle running speeds that will reduce \ntraffic-induced air pollution in the project corridor. The LRE is critical to reducing income disparities \nand achieving more balanced growth between the western and coastal regions. \n \n6.  Need to sustain road assets. As in other parts of the PRC, funding of maintenance for \ntolled highways is generally adequate. However, there have been funding shortfalls for non-tolled \nroads. In the past, the budgets for secondary and tertiary road networks were insufficient to meet \ntheir maintenance requirements and the maintenance backlog increased steadily, reflected in a \ngrowing share of roads measured to be in poor or very poor condition. \n \n7.  The national fuel taxation reform has been applied in Yunnan since 1 January 2009.9 Six \nlocal fees levied were abolished. Tolls on new class II roads are no longer allowed, and tolls on \nexisting class II roads are being phased out. In their place, the central government has introduced \na national fuel surcharge of CNY0.8 per liter for diesel and CNY1.0 per liter for gasoline since \n2009. As the central government collects the fuel tax, there is a need to establish mechanisms and \ndistribution channels for allocating these tax revenues to different users within the transport sector \nat the provincial level\u2014to ensure that funding is available for maintenance of the road network and \ndebt servicing for class II roads. Through ongoing small-scale technical assistance (TA),10 ADB is \nassisting the government to improve the PRC\u2019s road financing and distribution system after the fuel \ntax reform. \n \n8.  In  Yunnan,  much  remains  to  be  done  to  address  limitations  in  the  approach  to \nmaintenance. A pavement condition assessment carried out in 2009 of most of the 23,473 km non-\ntolled core network administered by YPHB found that only 35% of roads are in good-to-excellent \ncondition, which is low even for western provinces. As much as 31% of the assessed network was \nfound  to  be  in  very  poor  condition.11 This  reflects  a  backlog  in  the  financing  of  periodic \nmaintenance  and  rehabilitation.  On  average,  only  16%  of  the  estimated  annual  required \nrehabilitation is carried out and little periodic maintenance is performed. This lack of funding arises \npartly because the core road network is deteriorating faster than foreseen due to overloading and \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2001.

Manila.  \n9  This will bring the pricing system for roads closer to a pay-as-you-go mechanism. The additional fuel tax revenues are \nbeing used in part to maintain and manage roads and waterways. It is an efficient mechanism to collect road user \nfees, and provides an incentive to lower fuel consumption and promote vehicle fuel efficiency.  \n10 ADB.  2009.

Manila. \n11 Areas with degraded roads (with average speed of 10\u201320 km per hour) also produce large amounts of dust in \nYunnan\u2019s dry climate, resulting in significant environmental and health risks for people living near the roads. \n ", "  3\nsubstandard  road  design  and  construction.12 In  addition,  there  are  problems  of  insufficient \nmaintenance budget allocation by Yunnan Provincial Department of Transport (YPDOT) and over-\nexpenditure on establishment and overhead costs (less than 50% of the budget is spent on \nmaintenance works), although funding is expected to improve significantly over the next few years \nas a result of expected increases of 10% per annum in maintenance funding from YPDOT,13 most \nof which will go directly to maintenance implementation. There are also limitations in the approach \nto the planning and prioritization of maintenance works, and inefficient execution of maintenance \nworks results in high costs, especially for routine maintenance.  \n \n9.  Need to improve accessibility to remote poor areas. About 94% of the province\u2019s land \narea is covered by mountains and hills. This poses a great obstacle to providing basic rural road \naccess, particularly in the province\u2019s western region. Rural roads account for 87% of the total \nnetwork, of which county roads comprise 22%, township roads 56%, village roads 19%, and \nspecial roads 3%. Over 98% are class IV or unclassified. The majority (81%) are unpaved, with \n40% being gravel roads and 41% being earthen roads. Some 8% have cobblestone paving and the \nremaining 11% have asphalt or concrete pavement. At present, the condition of rural roads is poor, \nespecially unpaved township and village roads. In Dehong, the main prefecture benefiting from the \nproposed LRE, only 40% of county roads, 27% of township roads, and 19% of village roads are in \ngood condition.  \n \n10.  The government is committed to meeting the basic access needs of the poor. As a result of \nthe rural road maintenance reform policy that was approved by the State Council in 2005, the \nCCBs are entitled to receive a subsidy based on the length of their rural road network (CNY7,000 \nper km for county roads, CNY3,500 per km for township roads, and CNY1,000 per km for village \nroads). However, the subsidy levels are insufficient for roads in mountainous areas, and the actual \nsubsidy payment has often been less than the prescribed level. Moreover, a reliable system is not \nin place for implementation of rural road maintenance, especially for routine maintenance and \nminor repairs of low-volume unpaved roads, which make up a large part of the rural road network.  \n \n11.  For township and village roads, routine maintenance is carried out by local people on a \nvoluntary basis once a year, with households from the communities concerned contributing a few \nworkdays annually. This system is unreliable and has not significantly improved road conditions. Its \nvoluntary  nature  results  in  low  productivity  and  motivation  and,  often,  required  maintenance \nactivities are not carried out in a timely manner, as labor input is provided based on availability \nrather than need. Furthermore, the technical skills of the maintenance workers are limited, resulting \nin poor quality works.  \n \n12.  For the low-volume unpaved rural roads, a more effective community-based maintenance \nsystem needs to be introduced, including (i) payment of remuneration to ensure timely input of \nlabor, (ii) training for community members who can act as supervisors, and (iii) provision of tools \nand safety equipment. This is being pilot tested in Dehong prefecture with a $200,000 grant from \nADB\u2019s  Gender  and  Development  Cooperation  Fund  (GDCF),  and  will  be  replicated  in  the \ncommunity-based rural road output of the project. This output will focus on the maintenance of \n650 km of township roads in Dehong (half the township road network) for a period of 4 years. It has \npotential for wider replication as it will introduce a practical means of implementing cost-effective \nand  efficient  maintenance  while  the  labor-intensive  maintenance  approach  will  generate  local \nemployment  opportunities  for  the  poor,  including  women,  which  will  contribute  to  poverty \n                                                 \n12 Most of the damaged sections were designed between 1930 and 1970 when heavy axleloads were rare. Pavement \ndesign continues to be based on road class instead of on traffic volume and load, even though many of the roads are \ncarrying much higher traffic than intended for the respective road class. \n13 Figure 2 of the Sector Assessment (Summary): Transport and ICT (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n ", "4   \nalleviation.  The  capacity  of  CCBs  and  maintenance  groups  will  be  strengthened  to  ensure \nsustainability. \n \n13.  Lessons.  The  project  design  benefited  from  lessons  identified  in  ADB\u2019s  2008  sector \nassistance program evaluation of ADB assistance for roads and railways in the PRC,14 as well as \nfrom the lessons from four prior ADB-financed road projects in Yunnan.15 YPDOT has experience \nas executing agency for implementing four ADB-funded road projects. Out of the four, one was \nrated highly satisfactory; one was satisfactory; one was recently completed (not yet rated); and one \nis under implementation. Lessons learned from previous projects were reflected in the project \ndesign by (i) undertaking careful review of technical designs, traffic projections, economic and \nfinancial analyses; (ii) providing guidance to the executing and implementing agencies on ADB \npolicies,  guidelines,  and  procedures  on  environmental  protection,  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement,  and  procurement;  and  (iii)  introducing  an  appropriate  project  performance  and \nmonitoring system at the project design phase. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n14.  By supporting comprehensive improvement on the road transport system in Yunnan, the \nimpact of the project will be sustainable economic and social development in Yunnan Province. \nThe project outcome will be an efficient, safe, sustainable, and environment-friendly road transport \nsystem developed in the developed in the project area. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n15.  The project will have four outputs, as detailed below. \n \n16.  Output 1: Constructed new Longling\u2013Ruili highway corridor. The project will expand \nthe road capacity in western Yunnan by constructing a new 135 km, four-lane, access controlled \nLRE and a new 23 km of class II highway from Ruili to Nongdao16 with a design speed of 80 km \nper hour. The output is estimated to cost $1,649 million, of which ADB will finance $228 million. \nThe output will be managed by YHIC through LongRui Expressway Company (LREC). \n \n17.  Output 2: Improved local road network conditions in Yunnan.17 This will reduce the \nmaintenance backlog, resulting in large benefits at relatively low cost. A total of 605 km of local \nroads 18 will be rehabilitated and improved in nine prefectures and cities (Chuxiong, Dali, Dehong, \nand Honghe prefectures; Baoshan, Kunming, Lijiang, Lincang, and Qujing cities). These roads \nwere selected based on pavement condition, with priority given to sections in poor to very poor \ncondition. By prioritizing rehabilitation and maintenance through this output, ADB will contribute to \nprovince-wide  improvement  in  road  asset  management.  Traffic  safety  facilities,  maintenance \nplanning, and management practices will also be improved. The output is estimated to cost $100 \nmillion, of which ADB will finance $20 million. The output will be managed by YPHB. \n \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2007.

Output 3: Improved rural roads conditions in Dehong prefecture. A total of 650 km of \nrural roads will be improved in Dehong prefecture following a pilot phase funded by a $200,000 \nGDCF grant, which focuses on rural road maintenance using local labor to generate employment \nopportunities, and with additional attached TA support to extend the activity to border areas. Public \ntransport bus services on these roads will also be improved. The government will finance the \nestimated cost of $1.5 million to replicate the pilot phase activity and improve transport services. \nThe output will be managed by CCBs of DPCB. \n \n19.  Output 4: Enhanced performance by capacity building. This will include (i) improving \nmaintenance planning, funding, and execution; and (ii) providing on-the-job training to YPHB, \nLREC, CCBs of DPCB staff, and project road maintenance groups. The capacity building support \nfor  maintenance  will  include  improving  maintenance  execution  through  the  introduction  of \ncompetitive  bidding,  strengthening  pavement  design,  and  discouraging  overloading  through  a \ncombination  of  enforcement  intensity  and  traffic  load  monitoring  by  weigh-in-motion,  and \nintroducing more objective systems for programming maintenance through continuous dialogue \nwith the government under this project.19 The training will cover road safety, construction and \nsupervision, maintenance management, road financing, public transport services, private sector \nparticipation, environment management, social safeguard planning and monitoring, and project \nmonitoring and evaluation. ADB will finance the estimated output cost of $2 million. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n20.

The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of \n                                                 \n19 ADB also expects to support measures for ensuring adequate financing of road maintenance through a follow-on \npolicy and advisory TA to support implementation of the fuel tax reform that is to be submitted for ADB Management \napproval during 2010. \n20 ADB agreed to finance taxes and duties under this project, after due consideration and upon finding that the amount of \ntaxes and duties does not constitute an excessive share of project costs. \n ", "6   \n5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the loan and project agreements. The government has provided ADB \nwith (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the \nbasis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The \ngovernment will finance contingencies and financing charges during implementation.  \n \n22.  The  ADB  loan  will  finance  14.3%  of  the  project  cost,  including  taxes  and  duties  on \nexpenditures financed by ADB.21 The remaining cost will be financed by the Ministry of Transport, \nYunnan provincial government (YPG), and cofinancing through loans from Bank of China and \nChina Construction Bank, which have appraised the project and provided commitment letters. The \nMinistry of Transport and YPG have made budgetary provisions for the counterpart funds. The \nfinancing plan is in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan  \n \n  Share \nAmount \nSource  of Total \n($ million) \n(%) \nAsian Development Bank  250.00    14.30 \nDomestic bank loans  983.30    56.10 \nMinistry of Transport  179.90    10.20 \nYunnan provincial government  339.80    19.40 \n  Total  1,753.00    100.00 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n23.  The PRC will be the borrower. The ADB loan proceeds will be made available to YPG on \nthe same terms and conditions as the ADB loan. The government will ensure that (i) YPG onlends \nthe ADB loan proceeds to YPDOT; (ii) YPG causes YPDOT to apply a portion of the loan proceeds \nin an amount of $20 million for output 2 (to be executed by YPHB); and (iii) YPG causes YPDOT to \nonlend a portion of loan proceeds in an amount of $230 million to YHIC for output 1 (to be \nexecuted by LREC through YHIC) and output 4. The government will ensure that all onlending \nagreements will be executed upon terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. YPDOT and LREC \nthrough YHIC will bear the exchange rate and interest rate variation risks on the ADB loan. All \nonlending under the project will be on the same financial terms and conditions as those of the ADB \nloan.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n24.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the \nproject administration manual (PAM).22 \n \n25.  Based  on  a  procurement  capacity  assessment  undertaken  for  the  executing  and \nimplementing agencies, it was confirmed that, using a procurement agency and with assistance \nfrom ADB and consultants, the executing and implementing agencies could appropriately conduct \nprocurement work including advance contracting. A procurement agency that is familiar with ADB\u2019s \nprocurement procedures will be engaged to conduct the procurement of all works and goods under \nthe project on behalf of the executing and implementing agencies. \n \n \n                                                 \n21 The following principles have been used to determine the amount of taxes and duties to be financed in the project: \n(i) the amount of taxes and duties financed by the ADB loan does not represent an excessive share of the project \ninvestment plan, (ii) the taxes and duties apply only with respect to ADB-financed expenditures, and (iii) the financing \nof the taxes and duties is material and relevant to the success of the project since the percentage of some ADB-\nfinanced expenditures needs to be 100%. \n22 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  7\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation Period  January 2011\u2013December 2015   \nEstimated project  31 December 2015 \ncompletion date \nExpected loan and grant  30 June 2016 \nclosing date \nProject Management       \n(i)  Oversight body  Yunnan provincial government \n(ii)  Executing agency  Yunnan Provincial Department of Transport \n(iii)  Key implementing  (a)  LongRui Expressway Company, a wholly owned subsidiary company of Yunnan \nagencies  Provincial Highway Development and Investment Company (YHIC) \n(b)  Yunnan Provincial Highway Bureau (YPHB) \n(c)  Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture Communication Bureau (DPCB) \n(iv)  Project implementation  YHIC, YPHB, DPCB (one PIU each) \nunits (PIUs)   \nProcurement (ADB-  ICB for civil works  7 contracts  $299.6 million \nfinanced contract packages)  ICB for pavement  5 contracts  $137.9 million \n  ICB for equipment  1 contract  $3 million \n  NCB for rehabilitation  7 contracts  $32.6 million \nConsulting services (ADB- QCBS (80:20)  $2.0 million \nfinanced contract  - 80 person-months capacity building \npackages)  - 42 person-months international consulting services \nRetroactive financing and  Advance contracting approved.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n26.  The project is located in an area where most of the rural population is poor. Following \nsuccessful GDCF pilot testing, the government requested ADB to provide a small-scale TA to \nenhance the project benefits to the poor, especially to poor women from ethnic minorities living in \nthe border area.  \n \n27.  Small-scale  TA  of  $200,000  will  be  provided  to  support  community-based  rural  road \nmaintenance. This will be matched by a government counterpart in kind contribution of $40,000. \nThe TA will finance on-the-job training, safety equipment and supplies, and consulting services. It \nwill have two outputs: (i) rural road maintenance capacity building and skill enhancement programs \nfor the poor, vulnerable groups, and ethnic minorities; and (ii) preparation of a strategy and action \nplan for gender mainstreaming and support for livelihood opportunities. The TA will be financed on \na grant basis from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Other Sources). Details of the \nterms of reference, cost estimates and financing plan, and implementation arrangements are in the \nsmall-scale TA.23 \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n28.  The economic internal rate of return was estimated by  comparing scenarios with and \nwithout the project. The estimated economic benefits are (i) savings in vehicle operating costs as a \nresult of reduced road length, and improved traffic24 and road conditions; (ii) time savings for road \nusers; (iii) savings in road accident costs as a result of fewer accidents; and (iv) savings in carbon \n                                                 \n23 Small-Scale Technical Assistance on Community-Based Rural Road Maintenance by Women Ethnic Minority Groups \nin Western Yunnan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Summary Traffic Analysis is provided in Appendix 2 of the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2).  \n ", "8   \ndioxide emissions. The project is economically viable. The economic internal rate of return is 15% \nfor the LRE, and 52% for the rehabilitation and maintenance output. Sensitivity analysis confirms \nthe robustness of the project\u2019s economic viability.  \n \n29.  The financial analysis measured the LRE\u2019s ability to generate sufficient revenues from \noperations to meet all costs, and achieve a reasonable rate of return. The weighted average cost \nof capital, based on project funding assumptions, is compared with the financial internal rate of \nreturn to ascertain the financial viability of the project. The financial internal rate of return after \nincome tax is 4.7%, greater than the weighted average cost of capital of 3.0%. The project is \nfinancially  viable.  The  fiscal impact  of  counterpart  funding  for  implementation  of nonrevenue-\nearning outputs will be insignificant compared with total provincial and local fiscal revenues. The \ngovernment is taking steps to provide additional funds for maintenance of local and rural roads.  \n \nB.  Governance \n30.  All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). The relevant sections of the \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (2000,  as  amended  to  date)  will  be  included  in  all  procurement \ndocument and contracts.  \n \n31.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the Government of the \nPRC and YPG. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the \nPAM.  \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n32.  The project will benefit about 9.7 million people, of whom 70% are rural residents. The \nproject has nine distinct locations, including nine prefectures and 23 counties and districts. The \nProject will reduce average travel time by at least 40%. It will also reduce vehicle operating costs \nby 38%. The Project will (i) stimulate sustainable economic and social development, promote trade \nand  tourism  development;  (ii)  ensure  the  connecting  parts  of  the  transport  network  operate \nefficiently,  which  will  benefit  both  rural  and  urban  people  in  nine  prefectures  across  Yunnan \nprovince; and (iii) provide remote villages with improved access to schools, health care services, \nand markets. The labor-intensive approach to maintenance will create employment opportunities, \nbenefitting local people in Dehong prefecture, especially women, among the poor and ethnic \nminorities living in the border area. \n \n33.  Rural  poverty  incidence  is  15.2%  in  Yunnan.25 The  project  will  contribute  to  poverty \nreduction in the project area through (i) immediate job opportunities created through project-related \nworks, especially for the unskilled and poor (the project will create an extra 5.5 million work days, \nwith an additional remuneration of at least $47 million); and (ii)  improved access to education, \nextension services, healthcare, rural credit, and other government social development programs. \nThe project will accelerate socioeconomic development through higher land values, construction of \nnew houses, and other new businesses and jobs. By providing rural people with access to higher \npriced markets for agricultural products and reducing the costs of inputs, there will be incentives for \nagricultural  processing  activities  and  other  high-value  crops  (such  as  flowers,  tropical  fruits, \nvegetables, sugar cane, rubber, and tea) in the project area\u2019s rural townships and villages. \n \n34.  Gender. In January 2010, ADB approved a grant26 in the amount of $200,000 for piloting \nsupport  for  community-based  rural  road  maintenance,  which  targets  poor  women  and  ethnic \n                                                 \n25 Using the PRC poverty line of CNY1,196 per capita per year; that is well below the international poverty line of $1.25 \nper person per day (in 2005 purchasing power parity and measured in terms of consumption). \n26 This was financed under ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance for Promoting Gender Equality and Women Empowerment. \nManila (subproject: Community-Based Rural Road Maintenance by Women Ethnic Minority Groups in Yunnan \nProvince).  \n ", "  9\nminorities. The objectives of the pilot project are to (i) improve the road access of selected ethnic \nminority villages in Dehong Prefecture, (ii) establish and strengthen women\u2019s groups for rural road \nmaintenance,  and  (iii)  provide  technical  and  entrepreneurship  skills  to  women\u2019s  rural  road \nmaintenance  groups.  It  will  facilitate  economic  and  social  empowerment  of  poor  women  by \nproviding  access  to  financial  resources  from  maintenance  activities,  and  capacity  building  in \nhousehold livelihood development. The Project will result in integrating gender into the routine \nmaintenance provision in Yunnan Province and has potential to replicate the approach in GMS. A \ngender  action  plan27 and  two  knowledge  products28 have  been  prepared  to  facilitate  the \nimplementation.  \n \n35.  HIV and AIDS. Recognizing the potential social risk that the road construction may cause in \nthe project areas, a comprehensive HIV and AIDS Prevention Plan (HAPP)29 has been prepared as \npart of the road project design. The HAPP will consolidate and scale up good practices gained \nfrom previous investments in Yunnan and Guangxi, and in the GMS. An additional $200,000 grant \nwas provided to implement the HAPP.30 \n \nD.  Safeguards \n36.  Environment.  The  project  is  classified  environmental  category  A.  A  consolidated \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA)31 was prepared in compliance with the PRC regulatory \nframework and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The EIA summarized the findings of a \ndomestic EIA for the LRE, an environmental assessment and review framework for other outputs, \nand a due diligence assessment of the environmental impact of the project. The EIA, including an \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) for the project, which was discussed and endorsed by \nYPDOT, was circulated to ADB Board of Directors and made public through the ADB website on 7 \nMay 2010. The EIA requires environmental protection and mitigation measures costing CNY146 \nmillion. To ensure that all the potential adverse environmental impacts of the project are mitigated, \nYPDOT will implement the EMP as specified in the EIA. The EMP will be incorporated in the \nbidding documents and contracts for civil works; they will be monitored and semiannual reports \nsubmitted to ADB.  \n \n37.  Land  acquisition,  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified \ncategory A for resettlement and for indigenous peoples. YPDOT prepared a resettlement plan32 for \nthe LRE output. Resettlement information booklets have been distributed to affected villages. The \nproject will affect 35 administrative villages of 12 townships in Longling county of Baoshan city, \nLuxi city and Ruili city of Dehong prefecture. Some 770 hectares of land will be permanently \nacquired and 74,000 square meters of houses will be demolished. About 27,500 persons will be \naffected and the estimated resettlement cost is CNY552 million to be financed by counterpart \nfinancing. About 1 million people are expected to benefit directly in the LRE influence area, of \nwhich 38% are ethnic minorities. The village and household surveys indicated that ethnic minority \ncommunities support the project. Some of these ethnic minorities could face negative impacts or \nsocial risks, including through land acquisition and resettlement, communicable diseases, and \nchanges to traditional culture and value systems. To address these risks, a number of mitigation \nand enhancement measures have been designed and targeted at the most vulnerable groups. \n                                                 \n27 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n28 A Guide for Communications Bureaus and A Manual for Maintenance Groups have been prepared for Community-\nBased Routine Road Maintenance by Women\u2019s Groups. \n29 HIV and AIDs Prevention Plan is provided in Appendix 4 of the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 This was financed under ADB. 2006.
