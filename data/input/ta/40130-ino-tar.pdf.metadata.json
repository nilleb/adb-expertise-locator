The Government of Indonesia has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  develop  a  strategy  for  HIV  and  AIDS  prevention  in \ninfrastructure projects for the Ministry of Public Works (MPW).1 This request followed a dialogue \nwith MPW and the National AIDS Commission (NAC) about the potential spread of HIV through \ninfrastructure projects, especially transportation and road projects. The TA was programmed in \nconnection  with  the  ADB-financed  Road  Rehabilitation-2  project 2 Consultations  with \nnongovernment HIV and AIDS prevention and other development partners indicated potential \nrisks and shortcomings in current efforts to mitigate these risks. ADB conducted fact-finding in \nJune 2007 and agreed with the Government on the overall TA support and implementation \narrangements. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. 3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.      The number of HIV cases in Indonesia has been increasing exponentially since 2000. All \n33 provinces except for West Sulawesi are now reporting cases of HIV, and numbers are \nincreasing in 19 provinces. The Ministry of Health (MOH)4 estimates that up to 220,000 people \nof working age were living with HIV and AIDS in 2006, and 8.2 million were at high risk.5 By \n2010, the number of people with HIV and AIDS is projected to reach 400,000 and it is expected \nthat 100,000 will have died of AIDS.  \n \n3.      The nature of the pandemic has also evolved. The proportion of new infections among \nclients of sex workers is overtaking injecting drug users as the highest proportion of new \ninfections. In 1999, there were less than 20,000 persons living with HIV and AIDS, and 98% of \nall new HIV infections were among injecting drug users. The general population and injecting \ndrug users overlap through sex workers. The expansion of the pandemic into the general \npopulation is now being fueled by injecting drug users\u2019 sexual activity with their partners and sex \nworkers; sex workers to their 4 million clients and their 2.3 million partners. By 2006, injecting \ndrug users accounted for 37% of new infections, male clients of sex workers accounted for 33%, \nspouses of sex workers\u2019 clients 16%, and sex workers 12%.6 Infections among children, still low, \nhave started to appear.    \n \n4.  The link between mobility and HIV and AIDS is a well-documented phenomenon. As in \nother parts of the world, the three \u201cMs\u201d\u2014men, mobility and money\u2014are key ingredients for the \nspread  of  HIV.  Time  spent  away  from  home  is  significantly  associated  with  engaging  in \ncommercial sex, and the bulk of HIV and AIDS risk in Indonesia is linked to men who work away \nfrom home. Construction workers account for 5% of the labor force; they are overwhelmingly \nmale7 and are a key group vulnerable to HIV. In 2006, the industry grew at 9% and accounted \nfor 8.4% of the gross domestic product.  As Indonesia addresses its backlog of investment \nneeds and meets new growth-generated demand, the sector will remain strong. Much of the \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program 2006-2009: Indonesia. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2005. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of Indonesia for the Road Rehabilitation-2 Project. Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 26 October 2006.  \n4  Report  on  the  Estimation  of  the  Adult  Population  Vulnerable  to  HIV  Infection,  November  2006.  Available: \nhttp://lib.aidsindonesia.or.id/?collection.view.847  \n5 The  high-risk  population  includes  248,000  injecting  drug  users;  105,600  partners  of  injecting  drug  users; \n278,200 sex workers; 3,981,200 sex workers\u2019 clients; 2,305,000 partners of sex workers\u2019 clients; 35,300 waria \n(transgendered persons); 104,600 clients of waria; 1,149,300 men who have sex with men; and 116,800 prisoners. \n6  Male sex workers, men who have sex with men, and prisoners comprise the 2% balance (footnote 4). \n7   There are 122,000 female construction workers out of 4.2 million workers in the construction sector. \n ", "2   \ndemand is for investments requiring numerous workers on-site for long periods. Roads and \nbridges accounted for 28% of construction investment in 2006. Mobile construction workers \naway from home are more likely to engage in high risk behavior than the general population, \nand thus are more vulnerable to HIV and AIDS. \n \n5.  Indonesia has a well-developed HIV and AIDS response program. Presidential Decree \n36/1994 established NAC8 to coordinate the HIV and AIDS response program at the sectoral \nlevel. The recently adopted National Strategic Plan 2007\u20132010 and National Plan of Action \n(NPA) 2007\u20132010 detail the strategy and steps required to prevent and contain the spread of \nHIV  among  the  high  risk  and  vulnerable  population.  All  sectoral  agencies  are  required  to \nprepare specific sectoral strategies and plans in line with the national strategy and action plans.  \n \n6.  The NPA focuses on reaching the people most at risk via a comprehensive prevention \nprogram, with quantitative targets set for 2010.9 The high-risk population is defined as those \nengaging in high-risk behavior (footnote 5).  The NPA includes highly mobile people among \nthose defined as the \u201cat risk\u201d and vulnerable population. It identifies the workplace as an \nimportant entry point for HIV and AIDS awareness, especially for industries that are heavily \nmale (such as mining, transport, and construction). \n \n7.  Although construction workers comprise a significant proportion of the mobile labor force, \nthey  have  only  recently  been  identified  as  vulnerable  to  HIV.  Consequently,  construction \nworkers have not been included in existing programs targeting mobile populations, seafarers, \nsex workers, and long distance bus and truck drivers. Because of construction worker mobility, \nthey  are  generally  beyond  the  reach  of  the  Ministry  of  Health  residence-based  programs \ntargeting the general population.  \n \n 8.  The minister of manpower and transmigration, as a member of NAC, issued Ministerial \nDecree 68/2004 on HIV Prevention and Control in the Workplace, which requires employers to \nestablish their own occupational safety and health (OSH) schemes for HIV prevention and \ncontrol, disseminate information about HIV and AIDS, and protect workers with HIV and AIDS \nfrom discrimination. Compliance is still voluntary.  \n \n9.  MPW  is  responsible  for  construction  sector  standards,  including  OSH,10 to  mitigate \nindustry hazards11 through the MPW Construction Services and Human Resource Development \nBoard (BPKSDM). As a one-size-fits-all approach risks under-specifying requirements for some \nconstruction projects while overburdening others, OSH standards depend on the risk level of the \nassociated project and construction techniques employed. These standards can be amended to \nrequire HIV prevention training for projects with a high HIV risk. BPKSDM works with the \nNational Construction Industry Development Board responsible for certifying construction sector \nfirms and individuals, and with the National Association of Construction Contractors. \n \n                                                 \n8  Chaired by the coordinating minister of social welfare with the minister of health and the minister of home affairs as \ndeputy chairs. \n9  The program includes behavioral change, reaching people living with HIV and AIDS with antiretroviral treatment \nand other support needed, creating an enabling environment free of stigma, obtaining necessary funding, providing \nprophylaxis for pregnant women who are HIV positive, providing a package of support to orphans and vulnerable \nchildren, and reducing new infections. \n10 Through the minister of manpower and MPW Joint Decree 174/MEN/1986 on Occupational Health and Safety on \nConstruction Sites. The minister of manpower became the minister of manpower and transmigration in 2000. \n11 On-site fatalities and injuries occur from falls from height, motor vehicle crashes, electrocution, machines, and \nbeing struck by falling objects. Health hazards arise from on-site exposure to asbestos, solvents, and noise. \n ", "  3\n10.  ADB and other development agencies are incorporating HIV prevention programs for \nconstruction workers and local communities into infrastructure project design, implementation, \nand monitoring frameworks. The ADB strategy for HIV/AIDS states \u201cHIV/AIDS is not simply a \nhealth issue and cannot be addressed by the health sector alone\u201d and provides for mitigating the \nspread of HIV through the workplace.12 Developing the capacity of BPKSDM to promote HIV \nprevention through OSH certification and training for the construction sector\u2014at the firm level \nand  on  the  worksite\u2014is  a  sustainable  way  to  reach  a  sizable  vulnerable  population.  This \ninitiative is consistent with ADB\u2019s overall HIV and AIDS prevention strategy. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The  TA  impact  is  to  help  mitigate  the  risk  of  HIV  associated  with  infrastructure \ndevelopment by addressing high-risk behavior of workers in the construction sector. The TA \noutcome is an HIV prevention strategy and implementation mechanism for the construction \nsector.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  Component 1 develops an HIV and AIDS prevention strategy for the construction sector. \nComponent 2 develops appropriate OSH standards for HIV and AIDS prevention training for \nconstruction services providers and on-site workers on projects with high HIV risk. Component 3 \nbuilds the capacity of BPKSDM to roll out the strategy at the end of the TA. \n \n13.  Component 1 focuses on (i) developing the awareness of policy decision makers and \nstakeholders  of  the  need  for  a  construction  sector  HIV  and  AIDS  prevention  strategy, \n(ii) identifying the general scope of a sectoral strategy, and (iii) drafting the sectoral strategy. \nActivities include sharing information on HIV and AIDS vulnerability in the construction sector; \nNAC\u2019s response to HIV and AIDS, and international experience in addressing this vulnerability; \nidentifying  key  stakeholder  issues  and  concerns  on  HIV-related  OSH  standards  and \nimplementation;  working  with  BPKSDM  to  prepare  an  MPW  ministerial  instruction  on  the \npreparation of an HIV and AIDS strategy for the construction sector; and drafting the strategy. \n \n14.   Component 2 will (i) develop an HIV risk classification system for construction projects,   \n(ii)  prepare  amendments  to  existing  OSH  standards  for  projects  with  high  HIV  risk,  and \n(iii) assess the organizational structure of large- and medium-sized construction firms to identify \nconstruction service provider staff requiring HIV and AIDS prevention training. More specifically, \nthe TA will assist BPKSDM in creating an HIV risk classification system based on existing \nconstruction classification indicators13 to identify projects likely to employ numerous workers on-\nsite  and  away  from  home  for  an  extended  period.  Amendments  for  OSH  certification \nrequirements for construction service providers eligible to participate on projects with high HIV \nrisk, and OSH requirements applying to worksites, will be amended to include HIV and AIDS \nprevention  awareness  training.  Key  positions  of  personnel  responsible  for  training  budget \nallocations, personnel training and deployment, and on-site worker supervision, construction \nprofessionals whose specialty requires significant time at the worksite will be identified. The HIV \nand AIDS awareness training needs of these groups and on-site workers will be identified. \nStakeholders will be involved through a consensus-building consultative process.  \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2005. Development, Poverty and HIV/AIDS: ADB\u2019s Strategic Response to a Growing Epidemic. Manila. \n13 Including project value, construction technology, safety, and environmental impact. \n ", "4   \n15.   Component 3 develops OSH standards accreditation and certification procedures for \nHIV and AIDS prevention training, training materials, and training of BPKSDM master trainers. \nStakeholder  inputs  on  affordable,  accomplishable,  and  effective  certification  and  training \nmeasures is a requirement for this component. Training material will be adapted from existing \nsources and tested through the regular BPKSDM training program. \n \n16.   A number of assumptions are important to the success of the TA. It is essential that \n(i) construction  service  providers  support  the  development  and  implementation  of  an  HIV \nprevention strategy for high HIV risk construction projects, (ii) MPW continues to support HIV \nprevention in the construction sector, (iii) BPKSDM monitors compliance, and (iv) experienced \nnongovernment organizations are willing to work with BPKSDM. The greatest risks to achieving \nTA  impacts  are  insufficient  accredited  certifying  institutions  and  poor  construction  industry \nconsensus on acceptable costs and time requirements. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $240,000 equivalent. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $200,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government of Indonesia will \nfinance the balance equivalent to $40,000 in kind through the provision of counterpart staff, \noffice accommodation, and local communication. Details of the cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  BPKSDM  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  It  has  the  mandate  for  setting  standards \n(including OSH standards) to accredit certifying institutions; issue certification and competency \nstandards  for  construction  firms,  construction  workers,  and  worksite  conditions;  develop \nassociated curriculums; and help upgrade the capacity of certifying institutions, instructors, and \ntrainers. BPKSDM will appoint a TA coordinator to supervise TA activities; resolve any issues \nthat might arise during implementation; and facilitate coordination among consultants, National \nAssociation of Construction Contractors, NAC, and other stakeholders.  \n \n19.  The TA coordinator will organize the activities of three key BPKSDM centers and the \nBPKSDM  secretariat.  The  responsibilities  of  the  Center  for  Development  of  Construction \nEnterprises  include  business  regulation  and  facilitation  of  the  construction  services  forum \n(comprising the National Association of Construction Contractors, construction service provider \nassociations,  and  government).  The  responsibilities  of  the  Center  for  Development  of \nConstruction Implementation include developing and disseminating the Technical Handbook for \nOccupation Health and Safety. The Center for Development of Construction Expertise and \nTechnical Guidance develops constructions workers\u2019 qualifications, competency, and training \nstandards; produces related curriculum and training modules; accredits training institutes and \ninstructors; and promotes training development. The responsibilities of the secretariat include \nstrategic planning, programming and budgeting, and interdepartmental cooperation. An advance \npayment  facility  will  be  provided  for  workshop,  training,  and  seminar  activities  to  be \nimplemented by the Executing Agency. \n \n20.  The TA will require 4.5 person-months of international and 20 person-months of national \nconsulting services to be hired on an individual basis. The consultants will be engaged by ADB \nin accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). They will have expertise in the areas of HIV policy and prevention, mobility, construction \n ", "  5\nprojects  and  construction  service  providers,  OSH,  HIV  prevention  in  the  workplace, \ndevelopment of HIV prevention training materials for the workplace and familiarity with the range \nof training materials developed for mobile populations, and training of trainers. The outline terms \nof reference are in Appendix 3.  \n \n21.  The TA is expected to commence in December 2007 and be completed by June 2009. \nThe  Executing  Agency  will  provide  the  consultants  with  an  appropriately  furnished  office, \nrelevant information and data, counterpart staff, and administrative support. The consultant final \nreport and TA dissemination materials will be publicly disclosed through the ADB website upon \ncompletion of the TA.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n22.
