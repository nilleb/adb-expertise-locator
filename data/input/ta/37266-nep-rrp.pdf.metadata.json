It \nwill (i) provide roads to three district headquarters which are not \ncurrently connected and upgrade existing connection roads to all-\nweather condition in 17 districts (of the country\u2019s 75 districts); \n(ii) enhance capacity building of the Department of Roads (DOR) \nin  carrying  out  road  feasibility  studies\u2014in  terms  of  economic, \nsocial, and safeguard aspects; and (iii) enhance capacity building \nof local construction and consulting services industries in road \nconstruction and contract management.   \nThe Project is the first ADB sector modality intervention in the \ntransport sector in Nepal. A programmatic approach has been \nadopted to identify, screen, and prioritize candidate roads. The \napproach provides flexibility in project implementation under the \npresent conflict situation in Nepal. \n   \nRationale  Poor road connectivity is a major development constraint for the \ncountry. Inadequate feeder roads worsen the isolation of remote \nrural areas, mostly in northern hilly regions. Rehabilitating and \nexpanding  feeder  roads  will  contribute  to  inclusive  social  and \neconomic  development.  Improved  access  of  remote  people  to \nsocial facilities and employment opportunities in major towns will \nhelp  foster  a  broad-based  and  inclusive  social  and  economic \ndevelopment  process  to  achieve  a  steady  decline  in  poverty. \nADB\u2019s support for the inclusive development process will assist \nthe  Government  in  (i)  promoting  greater  balance  in  the \ndevelopment of different regions of the country; (ii) improving the \npoor\u2019s  access  to  basic  services,  opportunities  for  economic \nadvancement, and participation in the development process; and \n(iii) addressing  the  needs  of  disadvantaged,  women,  ethnic \ngroups, and lower castes. \nThe Project is in line with the Government\u2019s priority strategies \nwhich plan to complete road connection to all districts in the next \n10  years,  particularly  in  the  northern  part  of  the  country.  The \ncandidate roads are included in the Government\u2019s 10-Year Road \n   ", "ii   \nSector Midterm Program (2006\u20132015).  \n \nThe Project recognizes the importance of preventing HIV/AIDS \nand human trafficking, in line with the Government\u2019s 10th 5-year- \nplan (2002\u20132007). The Project will (i) carry out designed activities \nto  reduce  the  vulnerability  of  groups  at  risk  to  HIV/AIDS  and \ntrafficking, and (ii) increase access to HIV prevention services. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The Project will (i) support economic growth, particularly in rural \ncommunities; and (ii) help reduce the poverty of isolated people, \nmainly in hilly areas. An expanded and rehabilitated feeder road \nsystem  in  remote  areas  is  expected  to  enhance  access  to \nmarkets,  employment  opportunities,  and  health  and  education \nservice centers in major towns and district headquarters. It will \nalso contribute to sustained and broad-based economic growth \nand inclusive social development. The Project will construct new \nfeeder roads to three district headquarters and upgrade existing \ndistrict  roads  to  all-weather  condition  in  17  districts,  affecting \nabout  1.4  million  people.  The  capacity  of  DOR  and  local \nconstruction and consulting services industries will be enhanced.  \n   \nProject Investment Plan  The investment cost of the Project is estimated at the equivalent \nof  $80  million,  including  taxes,  duties,  and  interest  and  other \ncharges  during  construction  on  the  loan  cofinanced  by  the \nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Fund for \nInternational Development (OPEC Fund).  \n   \nFinancing Plan  It is proposed that ADB will provide a grant of the equivalent of \n$55.2 million from the Asian Development Fund IX (ADF IX) grant \nprogram. The grant will finance the project cost except the cost for \nland acquisition and resettlement, taxes, and duties. The OPEC \nFund will provide a loan of $10 million to finance the civil works \ncost of the road connectivity component. The OPEC Fund loan \nwill be administered by ADB. The Government will finance $14.8 \nmillion for the project cost, inclusive of taxes and duties, and the \ncost of land acquisition and resettlement.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2013 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2012 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Physical Planning and Works (MPPW)  \n   \nImplementation  DOR  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency.  The  existing  project \nArrangements  implementation  unit,  which  is  responsible  for  implementing \nongoing ADB-financed road projects, will be retained under DOR \nfor the Project.  \n   \n ", "    iii\nProcurement  Civil works contracts estimated at more than $2 million will be \nprocured  through  international  competitive  bidding.  Civil  works \ncontracts worth $2 million or less will be procured through national \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  MPPW \nstandard  bidding  documents  for  procurement  of  civil  works \ndeveloped under ADB technical assistance (TA) will be used for all \nnational competitive bidding contracts.  \nBidders  will  be  post-qualified  by  applying  a  single-stage,  one-\nenvelope bidding procedure. Equipment will be procured using \n(i) international  competitive  bidding  for  contracts  estimated  at \nmore than $1 million; (ii) limited international bidding for contracts \nestimated  at  $100,000\u2013$1,000,000;  and  (iii)  direct  contracting \narrangements for contracts valued at less than $100,000. \n   \nConsulting Services  A consulting firm will be recruited using ADB's quality- and cost-\nbased selection procedure in accordance with Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  and  Its \nBorrowers. About 60 person-months of international consultants \nand 1,322 person-months of national consultants will be required \nfor the Project. Consultants will carry out (i) detailed design and \nconstruction  supervision  of  sample  roads;  and  (ii)  feasibility \nstudies,  preliminary,  and  detailed  design  and  construction \nsupervision of non-sample roads. This will be done in line with \ngovernment  and  ADB  policies  and  guidelines,  and  based  on \ndemonstrated  sample  methodology  applied  to  sample  road \nfeasibility and preliminary design. Consultants will also assist DOR \nin  developing  a  baseline  for  systematic  project  performance \nmanagement systems monitoring and evaluation. Consultants will \n(i)  supervise  and  monitor  the  implementation  of  resettlement \nactivities,  environment  management  plans,  the  road  safety \nprogram, and the HIV/AIDS and anti-trafficking program; and (ii) \nprepare the overall project completion report.    \nLocal  nongovernment  organizations  will  be  recruited  for  about \n36 person-months to carry out the HIV/AIDS and anti-trafficking \nprogram.  \nMPPW  will  recruit  2  person-months  of  international  individual \nconsultants  and  4  person-months  of  domestic  individual \nconsultants,  on  the  recommendation  of  the  National  Vigilance \nCentre, to carry out project technical auditing in line with ADB's \nprocedures and approved terms of reference.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The  districts  covered  by  the  Project  have  a  high  poverty \nBeneficiaries  incidence,  from  37.4%  to  42.9%,  compared  with  the  national \naverage of 30.8%. Most of these districts are considered food \ninsecure  districts.  The  social  survey  indicates  that  better  road \nconnectivity  would  help  farmers  sell  agricultural  products  to \nneighboring  markets,  which  would  provide  more  agricultural \nemployment,  particularly  benefiting  the  poor.  The  Project  will \ncreate employment opportunities for skilled and unskilled labor \nduring implementation. Unskilled labor will be employed directly in \nroad  construction  and  indirectly  in  providing  materials  and \n   ", "iv   \nservices  for  contractors.  The  Project  will  provide  reliable  and \nshortened road access to social services, particularly health care \nservices,  education  facilities,  and  drinking  water  supply.  The \nProject will improve access to hinterlands for business and private \nsector  investments,  especially  agro-industries  and  the  tourism \nindustry. The poverty impact ratio of the sample roads is estimated \nat 0.44, indicating that substantial benefits may accrue to the poor. \n \nRisks and Assumptions  ADB\u2019s  portfolio  performance  in  Nepal  improved  in  2005,  as \nreflected in increased contract awards and disbursement, in spite \nof very challenging circumstances caused by escalation of the \nsecurity  conflict  since  2000.  The  Project  has  been  carefully \nformulated to manage and mitigate risks. Advance recruitment will \nhelp expedite consultant mobilization. The project implementation \nunit will be appropriately staffed. Nongovernment organizations \nwill be selected and engaged to help implement land acquisition, \nthe  resettlement  plan,  and  the  HIV/AIDS  and  anti-trafficking \nprogram.  The  consultants  will  help  procure  land  and  monitor \nproject  implementation.  ADB  will  rigorously  monitor  project \nimplementation  and  technical  auditing  throughout  the  project \nperiod  through  intensive  interactions  with  the  Government, \nMPPW,  and  other  funding  agencies.  Negative  environmental \nimpacts will be mitigated through the detailed mitigation measures \nset out in the summary environmental impact assessment, which \nwill be monitored by the consultants. The Government reassures \nthe Project\u2019s priority I status starting in FY2007/08 in terms of \nbudget  allocation,  particularly  the  cost  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement. \nThe Project has been prepared in full consultation with all local \ncommunities, which are expected to pass information to all parties \nin terms of the Project\u2019s potential benefits to local poor people. A \nsecurity assessment was carried out during project preparation. \nLocal  communities,  including  participants  believed  to  be \ninsurgents  or  related  to  insurgents,  expressed  support  for  the \nProject.  Lessons  learned  by  major  funding  agencies  active  in \nNepal,  including  ADB,  have  been  incorporated  in  the  project \ndesign. In the past, pro-poor projects had a much better chance of \nbeing less disturbed. Security risk mitigation measures include \n(i) overprogramming  candidate  roads,  (ii)  encouraging \nemployment of local contractors, (iii) incorporating an adequate \nconstruction  period  in  civil  works  contracts,  and  (iv)  providing \nflexible work program. Maximum use of local unskilled labor will \nbe encouraged by adopting labor-intensive construction methods \nas much as practicable. All these measures are expected to help \nproject implementation.  \nThe recent political development and newly declared cease-fire by \nthe  Government  and  insurgents  provide  reasonable  hope  for \ncautious optimism for safe and effective project implementation. \nThe  Government  confirmed  the  Project\u2019s  priority  and  its \ncommitment  to  continue  project  implementation,  including  all \n ", "    v\nagreed  assurances  in  the  report  and  recommendation  of  the \nPresident  and  financing  agreement.  However,  a  cautious \napproach  will  be  adopted  and  a  security  assessment  will  be \ncarried out in the process of contract award and approval of non-\nsample  roads.  This  will  prioritize  sections  that  are  considered \ncapable of being implemented safely and effectively and help in \nawarding contracts accordingly.  \n   \nTechnical Assistance  In conjunction with the Project, a TA is proposed to enhance the \ncapacity  building  of  (i)  DOR  in  carrying  out  road  feasibility \nstudies\u2014particularly in terms of economic analysis and social and \nsafeguard  aspects;  and  (ii)  local  construction  and  consulting \nservices  industries  in  road  construction  and  contract \nmanagement. The estimated total cost of the TA is $351,000, of \nwhich ADB will finance $300,000 on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding  program.  The  TA  consultants  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by the \nAsian Development Bank and Its Borrowers. \n   ", "",

The report also describes a proposed technical assistance (TA) \ngrant for capacity building in road feasibility study and construction and contract management, \nand if the ADB\u2019s Board of Directors approves the proposed grant, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA.1 \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Nepal's gross domestic product (GDP) growth slipped to 2% in FY2005 after recovering \nmoderately to about 3% in FY2003 and FY2004, from the downturn in FY2002. Nepal is a \nlandlocked country with a population of approximately 25.4 million people. It ranked 136 out of \n177 countries on the human development index in 2005, one of the lowest in the South Asian \nregion.  It  faces  difficult  challenges  in  reducing  poverty  and  achieving  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. While the national poverty incidence is 30.8%, it is about 37.4\u201342.9% in \nnorthern hilly areas.  \n3.  The transportation system in Nepal depends heavily on the road network which carries \nabout 90% of all passengers and freight within the country. Nepal\u2019s national road network has a \ntotal of 16,834 kilometers (km) of roads, comprising national highways, feeder roads, urban \nroads, district roads, and village roads. In 2002, the national highways and feeder roads, which \nform the country\u2019s strategic road network (SRN), reached about 4,861 km. There are 51 feeder \nroads totaling 1,852 km in length which provide major connections from highways to district \nheadquarters. About two thirds of feeder roads remain unpaved and much remains impassable \nduring the wet season.  \n4.  Road transport is the dominant transport mode in Nepal but road density is low at \n11.40 km of road per 100 square kilometers (km2) and 0.71 km per 1,000 population\u2014less than \nthat in neighboring countries. It is even lower in the northern part of the country at 5.22 km per \n100 km2 and 0.61 km per 1,000 persons. In Nepal, 15 out of 75 district headquarters are not \nconnected by road and almost 53% of district headquarters are not connected by all-weather \nroads; the majority of these are in the northern hilly area. This is mainly due to the country\u2019s \ncomplex topography and insufficient resources, which result in lack of road access for about \n4 million inhabitants and contribute to rural poverty throughout the country.  \n5.  The number of road accidents increased by 42% from 2002 to 2003, registering 5,430. \nThis rise was due to increased vehicle density together with lack of road safety measures, poor \ndiscipline, and enforcement and poor roadworthiness of vehicles. Although available statistics \nshow that the road fatality rate has declined significantly in the last few years to 27 deaths per \n10,000 vehicles, it remains one of the highest in the region.  \n                                                 \n1  The Project has been prepared through ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Nepal for Preparing the \nTransport Connectivity Sector Project (Financed by the Japan Special Fund). Manila (TA 4347-NEP, approved on 4 \nJune). The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n   ", "2   \n6.  The present road accident system is clearly inadequate in terms of data records to \nanalyze  the  causes  of  accidents,.  The  data  records  can  be  utilized  to  identify  accident \n\u201cblackspots\u201d, detect major causes, and develop countermeasures. The Traffic Engineering and \nSafety Unit (Road Unit) was established in 1994 in the Department of Roads (DOR). It produced \nguidelines for road safety including a traffic sign manual, road safety notes, and a highway \ncode;  and  conducted  training  for  traffic  police.  The  Project  will  strengthen  the  accident \ndatabase\u2019s software system and perform capacity training.  \n7.  The bus and freight transport industry is heavily regulated. The majority of operators of \nroad passenger and freight services are privately owned. Over 90% of passenger and freight \ntraffic is carried by buses and trucks. Route permits must be issued for the majority of sealed \nroads. Route fares are set by considering terrain and road pavement type and condition.  \n8.  During Nepal\u2019s 10th plan, five-year period, (Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, 2002\u2013\n2007)2,  the  Government\u2019s  total  planned  investment  in  the  road  sector  is  $485  million\u2014a \nsignificant increase over the amount allocated in the previous plan period. The investment \nbudget is about $73.1 million for FY2006, about 9.8% higher than that of FY2005.  \n9.  The National Planning Commission sets overall development objectives and coordinates \nthe  investment  programs  of  external  agencies  and  government  agencies.  The  Ministry  of \nPhysical Planning and Works (MPPW) has prime responsibility for (i) planning and formulating \nroad policies; and (ii) managing all land transport facilities, including roads and bridges. Within \nMPPW, DOR is responsible for network planning, design, construction, and maintenance of the \nSRN; municipalities are responsible for urban roads. The Ministry of Local Development (MLD) \nis  responsible  for  district  and  village  roads.  MLD\u2019s  Department  of  Local  Infrastructure \nDevelopment and Agricultural Roads (DOLIDAR) is responsible for coordinating and facilitating \nrural  infrastructure  development  throughout  the  country.  DOR\u2019s  Project  Directorate  (ADB), \nadministers ADB-financed road projects. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) provides funds for \nmaintenance of the SRN through Roads Board Nepal (RBN) and DOR. Since its establishment \non 30 December 2002, RBN approves DOR\u2019s annual road maintenance plan and controls the \npart of DOR\u2019s budget funded by RBN. DOR remains the planning and implementation agency \nfor maintenance funded by other sources\u2014such as direct allocation by MOF and projects \nfunded by ADB and the World Bank. \n10.  RBN\u2019s funding sources are mainly fuel levies (48.7%), vehicle registration fees (33.5%), \nand tolls (17.8%). These funds are used to maintain all roads. For FY2005/06, the total fund \nresources were NRs400 million ($5.6 million) which were allocated to SRN roads, urban roads, \nand district roads. The Government provides an additional NRs290 million ($4.1 million) to DOR \nfor SRN maintenance. The Government plans to provide adequate funding each year to RBN \nand eventually budget all road maintenance funds through RBN. The Government\u2019s budget \nsupport for road maintenance will continue until RBN revenue collection can fully meet the road \nmaintenance fund requirement. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2 National Planning Commission, Government of Nepal. 2003. The Tenth Plan (Poverty Reduction Strategy    \n  Paper) 2002\u20132007. Kathmandu. \n ", "   3 \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n  1.  Key Challenges \n    a.  SRN Extension and Maintenance Budget  \n11.  Nepal\u2019s 10th FYP recognized the need to improve rural transport connectivity to major \ntowns and cities\u2014in order to improve access and reduce transport costs to stimulate economic \ndevelopment,  particularly  in  agriculture.  Its  objectives  include  strengthening  political  and \nadministrative  linkages,  poverty  reduction,  and  minimizing  the  total transportation  cost  and \nadverse environmental impact. Major strategies adopted in the 10th FYP in the road sector \ninclude (i) increasing private sector participation in road construction and maintenance, and \n(ii) enhancing the institutional capacities of DOR and the private sector to ensure cost-effective \nsustainability of the road network. \n12.  The 20-year Road Master Plan for SRN (RMP) (2002\u20132022) sets out strategies to \nextend the SRN by 4,040 km to improve north\u2013south connectivity to district headquarters and \ncenters of trade, industry, and tourism. Connection of 12 out of 15 district headquarters, which \nare  not  yet  connected  by  road  to  national  highways,  is  proposed  during  the  10th FYP; \nconnection of the remaining three is planned during the 11th FYP. The Government\u2019s 10-year \nroad sector Midterm Program (MTP) (2006\u20132015) is the basis for selecting candidate roads for \nthe Project and other external financing agencies. The MTP plans to provide new connections to \nthree district headquarters and improve roads to all-weather condition in 17 districts. During the \nsame period, the SRN is to be extended by 200 km per year, and will be maintained to the \nrequired condition. The annual estimated expenditure for extension and maintenance of the \nSRN is about NRs5,700 million ($81 million). The RMP required substantial funding agency \nsupport for the budget in the initial RMP period for rehabilitation and reconstruction. However, \nsuch support is expected to decline significantly near the end of the planning period.  \n13.  Until 1990, Nepal's transportation focus was to develop basic transport infrastructure, \nconstructing 8,328 km of roads by 1991. By the early 1990s, neglect of road maintenance \nbegan to show and 52% of major roads were in poor condition in 1992. Growing understanding \nof the consequence of poor maintenance and the Government\u2019s focus on maintenance has led \nto massive rehabilitation and resealing of road networks, mostly through externally assisted \nprojects. The Government\u2019s efforts to strengthen road maintenance include (i) preparing road \nplans, (ii) establishing RBN, and (iii) increasing budget allocation for road maintenance. The \nRMP includes a long-term plan for road maintenance. It is estimated that about NRs1 billion \n($14  million)  will  be  required  each  year  for  SRN  road  maintenance.  In  contrast  to  road \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction,  where  the  Government  is  largely  dependent  on  external \nassistance, it currently provides budgetary funding for routine, recurrent, and most periodic \nmaintenance. The Government will provide full funding for periodic maintenance of at least \n500 km each year from 2006 to 2012. This will ensure proper maintenance of all maintainable \nSRN roads and clear up 800 km of deferred maintenance.    \nb.  Institutional Strengthening \n14.  Two  significant  developments  have  occurred  through  the  Government\u2019s  post-2000 \ninitiatives on institutional strengthening in public infrastructure construction and management: \n(i) the preparation of the public works directives (PWD) and, (ii) the establishment of RBN. The \nobjective of the PWD is to provide a set of understandable, effective, efficient, and practical \ndirectives\u2014a single source of procedures and reference documents for implementing public \n   ", "4   \nconstruction works (such as roads, irrigation, and civil aviation). The PWD has been in force \nsince 2002 and is the first manual of uniform procedures for public construction works and use \nof consulting services in Nepal. The PWD combine Nepal\u2019s financial administration rules and \nother rules and regulations on technical, social, and environmental matters. \n15.  The Roads Board Act, 2002, establishes RBN as an autonomous body to (i) manage the \ncollection and expenditure of revenue for repair and maintenance of all road networks (routine, \nrecurrent, periodic, rehabilitation, and emergency maintenance); and (ii) charge vehicles using \nthe roads. RBN formulates an integrated annual maintenance plan each year and allocates \nbudget for road maintenance works. \n16.   The importance of capacity building in the road sector has been widely recognized. \nInternational  funding  agencies  supported  capacity  building  in  DOR,  DOLIDAR,  and  RBN \nthrough several interventions. DOR prepared training management guidelines based on an \nanalysis of capacity building needs. ADB provided capacity-building assistance to (i) DOR in \npreparing the PWD; and (ii) RBN in strengthening the road tariff methodology. The National \nVigilance Centre (NVC) is one of the country\u2019s active anticorruption agencies, specializing in \nauditing project performance in terms of procurement, contract management, and construction \nquality. ADB has supported capacity building of NVC\u2019s technical audit to ensure transparency \nand good governance in infrastructure construction. The Swiss Agency for Development and \nCooperation has focused on capacity building in maintenance activities at the operational level \nof DOR division staff by introducing a planned maintenance approach since 1993 through the \nStrengthening  Maintenance  Divisions  Program.  This  program  trained  staff  in  all  25  DOR \ndivisions under \u201cYearly Plans of Operation\u201d. The United Kingdom\u2019s Department for International \nDevelopment has recently focused on institutional capacity in rural infrastructure development to \nsupport DOLIDAR and district development communities and village development committees, \nwhich plan and manage transport infrastructure in rural areas.  \n17.  As part of the Government\u2019s national transport policy (2002), an extensive capacity-\nbuilding and institutional-strengthening action plan is being carried out, including (i) preparation \nof a long-term institutional strategy for the SRN; (ii) comprehensive DOR corporate planning and \nperformance management; (iii) DOR planning and management, using efficient information \ntechnology  and  management  information  systems;  (iv)  effective  monitoring  and  evaluation \ncapacity; and (v) improved project financial management.  \n18.  DOR has developed basic capabilities to manage road assets and resources allocated to \nthe sector. However, further capacity building is necessary in the economic, environmental, and \nsocial aspects of road feasibility studies. These are important areas which could impede DOR\u2019s \nproject preparation efforts. DOR\u2019s capacity also needs to be enhanced by adopting a quality \nassurance system (QAS) in construction management. In view of its present capacity and future \ncapacity building programs, it is assessed that DOR will have the capacity to carry out the \nProject. \nc.  Private Sector Development and Capacity Building \n19.  Major road sector strategies adopted in the 10th FYP include (i) increasing private sector \nparticipation in road construction and maintenance, and (ii) enhancing the institutional capacities \nof the private sector to ensure cost-effective sustainability of the road network. The construction \nindustry is important for the economy and employment in Nepal. It is estimated that it employs \nmore than 140,000 personnel, ranging from unskilled workers to engineers, and has a total \nannual  turnover  of  NRs18  billion  ($257  million).  About  14,000  contractors  are  currently \n ", "   5 \nregistered in Nepal. They are categorized into four classes according to equipment owned, \nexperience, and financial status. This classification determines the qualification to participate in \nthe bidding process.  \n20.  Local  contractors  in  Nepal  have  improved  their  capability  in  the  last  decade  by \npurchasing more equipment. Although the Government\u2019s Financial Administration Rules do not \napply to externally funded projects, they state that national competitive bidding should be used \nfor  contracts  up  to  NRs250  million  ($3.5  million).  Experience  from  completed  contracts \ndemonstrates that a large number of local contractors can handle contracts up to that threshold. \n21.  Consulting firms are key players in road construction and maintenance\u2014in terms of \nplanning, design, and supervision of road works. About a total of 240 consulting firms are \nregistered with the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies; around 45 firms are actively \nengaged in projects funded by the Government and international funding agencies, although the \nsizes of the local firms are relatively small.  \n22.  The  Federation  of  Contractors\u2019  Association  Nepal  and  the  Society  of  Consulting \nArchitectural and Engineering Firms were established to advocate activities for the development \nof the construction and consulting services industry. Their main objectives include the following: \n(i) develop professional capabilities, (ii) eliminate unhealthy and unfair competition, (iii) advise \nmembers on technical and legal matters, (iv) suggest government formulation and amendment \nof all policies related to the construction industry, and (v) provide technical training opportunities \nto members.  \n23.  Although local contractors and the consulting services industry have improved their \ntechnical capacity over the years\u2014mostly through externally funded projects\u2014the need for \ntraining has been identified in the International Federation of Consulting Engineers (FIDIC) \ncontract management and QAS (Appendix 2 and Supplementary Appendix A). \n  2.  External Assistance \n24.  Development of Nepal\u2019s road network is heavily reliant on external funding. Since 1976, \nADB has provided the Government with seven transport projects totaling $219.4 million and TAs \ntotaling over $3.5 million to construct or upgrade about 1,800 km of highways and feeder roads. \nThese projects included (i) a large portion of road upgrading and periodic maintenance of the \nEast\u2013West Highway; and (ii) improvement of hilly roads, accounting for about 25% of Nepal\u2019s \nroad development expenditure. Major bilateral funding agencies in Nepal\u2019s road sector include \nGermany, India, Japan, People\u2019s Republic of China, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and United \nStates.  Multilateral  funding  agencies  include  the  World  Bank  and  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme (Appendix 3). \n  3.  Lessons Learned \n25.  The road sector presents progressing experience in terms of project implementation \nperformance.  Over  the  years,  MPPW  has  demonstrated  improved  capacity  to  implement \nprojects.  However,  it  needs  to  strengthen  capacity  building  in  road  feasibility  studies  and \ncontract management.  \n26.  Efforts are being made by ADB and the Government to optimize project implementation \nin conflict situations. Experience shows that problems caused by conflict situations for most \nprojects  tend  to  be  time-  and  site-specific  but  most  were  able  to  continue  without  major \n   ", "6   \nconstraints. Although many projects experienced implementation difficulties (such as strikes) to \nsome extent, contract awards and disbursements in 2005 showed improvement over year 2004. \n27.  A conservative implementation schedule is provided with adequate contingency. Active \nconsultations and public participations were carried out during project preparation\u2014particularly \nwith respect to land acquisition and prevention of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking\u2014to increase \npublic awareness and address community road-related needs. This will facilitate public support \nfor the Project and reduce disruptions during implementation. The sector modality provides \nflexibility in selecting subprojects in accordance with local conflict levels. Experience in similar \nprojects has shown that maximum use of national competitive bidding provided the possibility of \nbetter coordination with local parties and less interference from insurgents, especially when \nlocal unskilled labor from local villages carried out some of the work. Successful implementation \nof completed works suggests that local contractors are capable of handling most types of \nroadworks under the Project. The project design considered lessons learned from previous \nprojects. \n  4.  Asian Development Bank Sector Strategy \n28.  Nepal\u2019s country strategy and program (2005\u20132009)3 sets out the strategy for promoting \nbroad-based and inclusive social and economic development to achieve a steady decline in \npoverty.  A  key  element  is  the  development  of  the  road  network,  which  will  assist  the \nGovernment in (i) promoting balanced regional development; (ii) improving the poor\u2019s access to \nbasic services, opportunities for economic advancement, and participation in the development \nprocess; and (iii) addressing the needs of disadvantaged, women, ethnic groups, and lower \ncastes. \n29.  In the transport sector, the key to mainstreaming excluded regions and social groups in \nthe  economy  is  to  foster  connectivity  between  all  parts  of  the  country  and  facilitate  trade \nbetween  Nepal  and  its  neighbors.  ADB  supports  the  Government  in  (i)  improving  rural \naccessibility, (ii) reducing isolation within the country, and (iii) promoting subregional connectivity \nwith  neighboring  countries.  The  Government  is  committed  to  improving  overall  sector \nperformance and recognizes the need for a combination of network improvements, institutional \nreform,  and  improved  asset  management.  This  approach  is  supported  by  other  external \nagencies.  \n30.  A programmatic approach has been adopted in identifying, screening, and prioritizing \ncandidate roads (Appendix 4 and Supplementary Appendix B). Selection of candidate roads for \nthe project financing may be further reviewed during the project implementation period. The 10th \n5-year MTP is based on the Government\u2019s 20-year RMP by adopting multi-criteria analysis in \nconsidering district headquarters\u2019 connectivity, economic worth and potential, population and \nroad density, extent of land acquisition and resettlement, poverty, environment, construction \ncost, and security concerns. The MTP consists of (i) a 10-year road investment priority plan \n(2006\u20132015) in the feeder road network to improve connectivity between rural roads and major \ntowns and district headquarters; (ii) recommendations to strengthen the Government\u2019s capacity \nto manage and operate the road network safely and efficiently; and (iii) capacity training to \nstrengthen the capabilities of DOR, local contractors, and consulting services to improve and \nmaintain road construction and management.  \n                                                 \n3 ADB.  2004. NEPAL Country Strategy and Program 2005-2009. Manila. \n ", "   7 \n31.  ADB requirements for the sector project are the (i) existence of a sector development \nplan, (ii) institutional capability to implement the sector development plan, and (iii) development \nof  policies  to  enable  the  sector  to  improve  its  performance.  It  is  assessed  that  these \nrequirements are satisfactorily met in view of (i) the MTP, (ii) DOR\u2019s current institutional capacity \nand planned strengthening, and (iii) adopted and new policy initiatives in the road sector. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome  \n32.  The Project will (i) support sustained and broad-based economic growth and inclusive \nsocial development; and (ii) help reduce the poverty of isolated people, mostly in hilly areas. An \nexpanded and rehabilitated feeder road system in remote areas will improve access to markets, \nemployment opportunities, and health and education service centers in major towns and district \nheadquarters. The capacity of DOR and local construction and consulting services industries will \nbe enhanced.  \nB.  Outputs \n33.  A total of 25 roads and bridge measuring about 1,383 km are included in the MTP; 10 \nroads and 1 bridge totaling about 490 km are planned for investment under the Project and the \nremainder  is  envisaged  for  other  projects.  The  Project  will  finance  the  construction  and \nupgrading  of  feeder  roads  covering  17  out  of  75  districts\u2014located  mostly  in  western, \nmidwestern, central, and eastern regions\u2014affecting about 1.4 million people. Three district \nheadquarters at Chame, Diktel, and Salleri will be connected by road to national highways for \nthe first time. Existing roads will be improved to all-weather condition at Bhaktapur, Dhading, \nDolakha, Kapilbastu, Kathmandu, Khotang, Lamjung, Manang, Myagdi, Nuwakot, Okhaldhunga, \nPanchthar, Ramechhap, Rasuwa, Sindhuli, Solukhumbu, and Taplejung.  The districts covered \nby the Project are mostly poor districts. Consulting services will be provided to assist in project \nimplementation and capacity building of DOR, local contractors, and consulting firms.  \n  1.  Road Connectivity Component \n34.  About 10 feeder roads will be constructed or upgraded. Three sample roads (Galchi\u2013\nTrisuli\u2013Dhunche-Syaphrubesi,  Phidim\u2013Taplejung,  and  Tamakoshi\u2013Manthali\u2013Khurkot)  totaling \nabout 227 km have been selected for preliminary engineering, economic, social, resettlement, \nand environmental studies; and will serve as sample for feasibility studies of non-sample roads \n(Supplementary Appendix C). \n35.  MPPW will prepare seven non-sample roads measuring about 263 km through project \nimplementation consultants. The non-sample roads will be selected in accordance with selection \ncriteria adopted for sample roads and in sequence of priority in the list. All subprojects must \nhave an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of more than 12%, and meet government and \nADB policy social/resettlement and environmental requirements.  \n  2.   HIV/AIDS Prevention and Anti-Trafficking Program \n36.  The Project recognizes the importance of preventing HIV/AIDS and human trafficking. \nThe Project provides an opportunity to link the transport sector with already existing HIV/AIDS \nand  anti-trafficking  programs  in  support  of  government  strategies,  and  increase  access  to \nHIV/AIDS  services  and  care.  The  anti-trafficking  program  will  help  mitigate  the  spread  of \n   ", "8   \nHIV/AIDS, so it is included in the HIV/AIDS and anti-trafficking program to be financed by the \ngrant. The Project will (i) carry out designed activities to reduce the vulnerability of groups at risk \nof HIV/AIDS and trafficking, and (ii) increase access to HIV prevention services. Beneficiaries \nwill include road construction workers, transport drivers, female sex workers, migrants, and \npopulations living along the road corridors. DOR officials and local government employees will \nbe  trained.  This  component  has  been  formulated  on  division  of  labor  with  other  funding \nagencies and existing government programs to avoid duplication, and will be financed from the \nAsian Development Fund IX (ADF IX) grant. Background, terms of reference (TORs), and cost \nestimates are in Appendix 5 and Supplementary Appendix D. The HIV/AIDS and anti-trafficking \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 6.   \nC.  Special Features \n37.  This is the first ADB sector road project in Nepal and a programmatic approach is used \nto prepare a 10-year road sector midterm program. This makes it possible to select road \nconnectivity subprojects under a well-prepared and balanced context with a clear picture of the \ninstitutional  capacity,  road  investment  plan,  funding  constraints,  subproject  priority,  and \nmaintenance capability in the country\u2019s road sector.  \n38.  The Project proposes a modest scale of pavement rehabilitation and resurfacing and \nother supporting works, which present a much more acceptable design in terms of economic \nefficiency and resettlement and environmental impact. \n39.  ADB has assisted Nepal in improving road safety by strengthening policy requirements, \ntraining, and equipment applications. The road safety program under the Project will assist in \nroad safety improvement. Safety auditing will be carried out (i) during and immediately after \ncompletion of the detailed design, and (ii) before tendering. Improvements will be carried out on \nproject roads, including road signs, and training counterpart staff. The road accident database \nwill be strengthened through updated software, and staff will be trained in its application and \nmaintenance.  Other  road  safety  activities  will  be  designed  and  implemented,  including \ncommunity-oriented road safety awareness programs. The new aligned sections will meet road \nsafety standards on road geometry, intersections, and side drains. On the exiting alignment, \naccident-prone  places  or  black  spots  will  be  identified  and  improved.  The  Heavy  Vehicle \nManagement  Policy  to  be  adopted  by  the  Government  will  help  alleviate  the  overloading \nsituation, which damages road safety and the road pavement.  \n40.  Extensive consultations were held during project preparation with government agencies \nand local population on social services, minority development, environmental protection, water \nand forest resources management, and resettlement. Close consultation with external funding \nagencies active in Nepal helped formulate the HIV/AIDS prevention and anti-trafficking program \nwith a clear division of labor and complementary scheme.  \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n41.  The project investment cost is estimated at the equivalent of $80 million, including taxes, \nduties, and interest and other charges on the loan during construction (Table 1 and Appendix 7). \n \n \n ", "   9 \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n \nItem    Amounts \nA.

Financing Plan \n42.  The Government has requested a grant of $55.2 million from the ADF IX grants program \nfor  the  Project  (Table  2).  The  grant  will  finance  the  project  cost  except  the  cost  of  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement,  taxes,  and  duties.  ADB  may  finance  eligible  expenditures  in \naccordance with different ratios specified for each cost category. The OPEC Fund will provide a \nloan of $10 million to finance the civil works costs of the road connectivity component. The \nOPEC Fund will have a 20-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 1% \nper annum, and service charge of 1%. This loan will be administered by ADB. The Government \nwill  finance  $14.8  million  of  the  project  cost,  including  the  cost  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement, taxes, and duties.   \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total  % \nAsian Development Bank  55.2  69.8 \nOPEC Fund  10.0  12.7 \nGovernmenta   14.8  17.5 \n  Total  80.0  100 \n     OPEC = Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. \n       a  Including taxes and duties. \n            Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n   ", "10  \nF.  ADF IX Grant Financing \n43.  Under the ADF IX Resolution,4 Nepal\u2014with per capita gross national income of $230\u2014\nwas classified as one of the poorest and most debt-stressed countries, and eligible for ADF \ngrant financing for up to 50% of the total assistance program under category B of the ADF IX \nGrants Allocation Framework5 (the Framework). The grant will finance road connectivity and the \nHIV/AIDS  prevention  and  anti-trafficking  program.  Against  the  backdrop  of  deteriorating \ndevelopment, the principal objective of the grant is to reduce the isolation of remote rural \ncommunities, mostly in the hilly region, by enhancing (i) the poor\u2019s access to basic services, \n(ii) employment opportunities, and (iii) health and education service centers in major towns and \ndistrict headquarters. The project roads cover wide areas of poor population. Nepal is also \neligible for grant financing for HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases under category C of the \nFramework.6  Proposed  activities  along  the  project  areas  are  fully  supported  by  relevant \ndevelopment partners, including the United States Agency for International Development and \nthe United Nations Development Programme. ADB and the Government recognize HIV/AIDS as \na crosscutting development theme which is linked to and exacerbated by the human trafficking \nissue. The anti-trafficking program will help mitigate the spread of HIV/AIDS, so it is included in \nthe HIV/AIDS and anti-trafficking program to be financed by the grant. Grant effectiveness will \nbe  assessed  within  the  broader  context  of  project  performance.  The  Project\u2019s  design  and \nmonitoring frameworks for the Project and the HIV/AIDS prevention and anti-trafficking program \nhave clear indicators to measure the inputs, activities, and outputs. \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n  1.  Project Management \n44.  MPPW will be the Executing Agency and DOR will be the Implementing Agency. Both \nhave extensive experience in implementing ADB-financed road projects. The Project Directorate \n(ADB),  established  in  1987,  will  be  maintained  within  DOR  and  serve  as  the  project \nimplementation unit (PIU). The PIU director (the director) will have overall responsibility for all \naspects  of  project  implementation  and  management,  including  procurement,  progress \nmonitoring, financial management, reporting, land acquisition and resettlement, and HIV/AIDS \nand  anti  trafficking  prevention  programs.  The  director  will  act  as  project  coordinator  for \ngovernment agencies concerned. DOR will maintain the full-time director for at least the first \n2 years of project implementation and promptly inform ADB of any change of director. DOR will \nensure  that  the  person  appointed  will  (i)  be  a  senior  officer  with  adequate  technical  and \nadministration experience and qualifications; and (ii) be assisted by appropriate and adequate \ntechnical, financial, and administrative staff. One project office in Kathmandu and at least three \nfield project offices will be set up to be responsible for day-to-day implementation and report to \nthe director (Supplementary Appendix E). \n45.  The HIV/AIDS prevention and anti-trafficking component will be implemented by local \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) under the overall responsibility of the PIU. DOR will \nensure that adequate counterpart facilities and staff assist in the implementation, and essential \nDOR officials will be trained to ensure the sustainability of DOR\u2019s capacity after the Project.  \n \n                                                 \n4 Eighth Replenishment of the Asian Development Fund and Third Regularized Replenishment of the Technical \nAssistance Special Fund (ADF IX Resolution). \n5 ADB. 2004.

Implementation Period \n46.  The Project will be implemented over 6 years, including preconstruction and a 12-month \ndefect liability period, and is expected to be completed by December 2012. Civil works will \ncommence around January 2009. This schedule is dependent on, among others, (i) consultants \nbeing engaged by the end of September 2007; and (ii) land being made available, free from any \nencumbrances, within about 18 months after the Project starts and before construction begins. \n(Appendix 8). \n  3.  Procurement  \n47.  Procurement to be financed from the ADB grant will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2006). The Government will prepare and update annually a \nprocurement plan in the course of finalizing and implementing the subprojects. Civil works \ncontracts estimated at more than $2 million will be procured through international competitive \nbidding; those estimated at $2 million or less will be procured through national competitive \nbidding procedures acceptable to ADB. MPPW standard bidding documents for civil works \nprocurement, developed under an ADB TA, will be used for all national competitive bidding \ncontracts.  \n48.  Packaging of sample roads reflects the consideration of engineering complexity, local \ncontractor capacity, and the local security situation. Contract packaging for non-sample roads \nwill be decided during implementation in line with the same approach (Appendix 9). Indicative \nProcurement Plan is in Supplementary Appendix M.    \n49.  Bidders  will  be  post-qualified  by  applying  a  single-stage,  one-envelope  bidding \nprocedure. Equipment will be procured through (i) international competitive bidding for contracts \nwith an estimated value of more than $1 million, (ii) limited international bidding for contracts \nestimated  at  $100,000\u2013$1,000,000,  and  (iii)  direct  contracting  arrangements  for  contracts \nvalued at less than $100,000.  \n  4.  Consulting Services \n50.  A  consulting  firm  will  be  recruited  using  ADB's  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nprocedure  under  full  technical  proposals,  in  accordance  with  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants by the Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers. About 60 person-months of \ninternational consultants and 1,322 person-months of national consultants will carry out (i) \ndetailed  design  and  construction  supervision  of  sample  roads;  and  (ii)  feasibility  studies, \npreliminary and detailed design and construction supervision of non-sample roads. This will be \ndone in line with government and ADB polices and guidelines, and based on demonstrated \nsample methodology applied to sample road feasibility and preliminary design. Consultants will \nalso assist DOR in developing a baseline for systematic project performance management \nsystem (PPMS). Consultants will (i) supervise and monitor the implementation of resettlement \nactivities, environment management plans, and the HIV/AIDS and anti-trafficking program; and \n(ii) prepare the overall project completion report. Local NGOs will be recruited for about 36 \nperson-months to carry out the HIV/AIDS and anti-trafficking program under the supervision of a \ndomestic social development specialist. MPPW will recruit two person-months of international \nindividual  consultants  and  four  person-months  of  domestic  individual  consultants,  on  the \nrecommendation of NVC, to carry out project technical auditing in line with approved TORs \n(Appendix  10).  Outline  TORs  for  design  and  construction  supervision  consultants  are  in \nAppendix 11 and Supplementary Appendix F. All individual consultants will be selected and \n   ", "12  \nengaged in line with ADB's procedures for recruiting individual consultants.  \n  5.  Anticorruption Policy \n51.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998) was explained to and discussed with the Government \nand  MPPW.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant regulations \nand the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of MPPW, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project.  \n52.  Technical auditing will be conducted at key project implementation milestones in terms of \nprocurement,  contract  management  and  payment,  and  construction  quality  to  promote \ntransparency and good governance in infrastructure construction. Before the project midterm \nreview (MTR), DOR will carry out project technical auditing of project procurement, contract \nadministration,  and  quality  inspection,  in  cooperation  with  NVC.  DOR  will  be  assisted  by \nindividual international and national consultants with expertise and experience in engineering \nand contract management, who will be appointed by MPPW from among NVC\u2019s nominees. The \nconsultants\u2019 final report will be submitted to ADB and NVC through MPPW and published in \nMPPW\u2019s  bulletin  board  and  publications.  NVC  will  provide  counterpart  staff  to  help  the \nconsultants carry out the technical auditing. Suspected irregularities will necessitate further \ngovernment action for full investigation and application of disciplinary procedure, once proven.  \n53.   To promote good governance, the Government will publicize project implementation \ninformation  on  DOR\u2019s  website  on  a  pilot  basis.  The  information  will  cover  at  least  the \nprocurement process, progress related to resettlement, social and environmental activities, and \nthe findings of the technical auditing. \n  6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n54.  An  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in \naccordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook7 as amended from time to time, and \ndetailed arrangements between the Government and ADB. The initial amount to be deposited in \nthe imprest account will be based on the estimated expenditures for 6 months or 10% of the \ngrant amount, whichever is lower. The account will be established with Nepal Rastra Bank. To \nexpedite disbursement during implementation, statement of expenditures procedure will be used \nto reimburse or liquidate the imprest account advance for any individual payment not exceeding \n$100,000. \n  7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n55.  A financial management assessment of DOR has been carried out. DOR will maintain \nseparate project records and accounts to identify goods and services financed from grant \nproceeds, financing resources received, project expenditures, and use of local funds. A separate \naccount  will  be  maintained  for  the  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  anti-trafficking  program  to  be \n                                                 \n7 ADB. January 2001. Loan Disbursement Handbook. Manila. \n ", "   13\nfinanced from ADF IX. Accounts for all project expenditures will be set up in accordance with \nconsistent and sound accounting principles and in line with the applicable laws in Nepal. An \nindependent auditor satisfactory to ADB will audit the consolidated project accounts and related \nfinancial statements annually. Due to the diversity of project sites\u2014and procedures involving \nMPPW, MOF, and the auditor general\u2019s office\u2014unaudited and audited project accounts and \nfinancial statements will be submitted to ADB within 6 and 9 months, respectively, after the end \nof the fiscal year. The audit requirements should include an audit with a separate opinion on the \nuse of the imprest account and statement of expenditure procedures, and account for the \nHIV/AIDS prevention and anti-trafficking program. \n56.  DOR will ensure that consultants include the status of the following in the monthly \nprogress  reports  to  DOR,  MPPW,  and  ADB:  (i)  land  acquisition,  (ii)  resettlement, \n(iii) environmental management, (iv) training, (v) prevention of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking, \nand (vi) other activities critical to project implementation but not directly included in the scope of \nengineering  services.  Within  3  months  of  physical  completion,  DOR  will  submit  a  project \ncompletion report in a format acceptable to ADB. DOR will monitor project implementation in \naccordance  with  the  implementation  schedule,  and  keep ADB  informed  of  any  significant \ndeviation that could result in deviation from the schedule. \n  8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n57.  The  expected  socioeconomic  impact  will  cover  (i)  income  per  capita  per  district, \n(ii) annual production of main cash crops, (iii) villages with telephone connections, (iv) road \naccess and bus service, (v) primary school dropout rate, (vi) middle school attendance rate and \nunattended home births, and (vii) progress in HIV/AIDS prevention and anti-trafficking. Road \nroughness, traffic counts, vehicle ownership, trip times and cost, and bus frequency and cost \nand accident data are an essential part of the overall performance monitoring process and \nscheduled in the PPMS. Where relevant, indicators will be disaggregated by gender. Baseline \nindicators will be collected before constructions start. DOR will monitor these indicators annually \nduring project implementation and 3 months after project completion. Performance indicators \nwill be used to assess if development objectives have been attained. \n  9.  Project Review \n58.  In addition to regular reviews by ADB staff, the Government and ADB will perform a joint \nMTR to assess the Project\u2019s progress and agree upon any changes to scope or implementation \narrangements. The MTR will be conducted by the end of third year of implementation. MPPW \nwill submit to ADB a detailed status report on project implementation 2 months before the MTR.  \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n59.  A TA of $300,000 for capacity building in road feasibility study and construction and \ncontract management (Supplementary Appendix G) will be provided to (i) strengthen DOR\u2019s \ncapacity in road feasibility studies, particularly in social, resettlement, and environmental impact \nanalysis and management; and (ii) enhance the capacity of local construction and consulting \nindustries in applying FIDIC contract management and QAS in road construction. The TA will \ntrain DOR officials by using one of the non-sample roads as a pilot case, and develop a road \nfeasibility studies tool kit in line with ADB\u2019s guidelines, with modifications for Nepal. The tool kit \nwill supplement the PWD and help the Government prepare a road development master plan. \nThe strengthened capacity of local contractors and consulting services will contribute to private \nsector development in the road sector.   \n   ", "14  \n60.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the TA funding program and carried out by \nindividual  consultants:  (i)  about  3  person-months  each  of  international  input  for  transport \neconomics  and  social  resettlement,  (ii)  2  person-months  of  international  input  for  FIDIC \napplications  and  QAS,  and  (iii)  2  person-months  of  domestic  input  for  environmental \nassessment.  \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Technical Aspect \n61.  The Project will (i) improve road geometric design, surface condition, drainage system, \npavement strength, and bridges; (ii) widen the carriageway; and (iii) provide road signage and \nmarking. This will improve the level of service, reduce vehicle operating costs (VOCs), shorten \ntravel time, and improve riding comfort. The risk of road accidents caused by increased and \nfaster travel will be mitigated by provision of proper safety features. The Project will also \nincorporate  environmental  consideration  in  the  design  and  construction,  including \nbioengineering in slope protection. \nB.  Policy and Institutional Improvements \n62.  The Project is built upon agreed policy reform, particularly in terms of road safety, \ntechnical  auditing,  and  the  establishment  and  operation  of  RBN.  Further  capacity  building \nproposed under the Project will help DOR and local construction and consulting industries to \ndevelop the necessary capacity to prepare feasibility studies, construction management, and \nquality assurance. The Project will also assist DOR in accumulating capacity in mainstreaming \nHIV/AIDS  prevention  and  anti-trafficking  into  road  sector  development.  Proposed  technical \nauditing will enhance the Government\u2019s capacity and experience in dealing with irregularities in \nroad sector development. \nC.  Economic Analysis \n63.  Upgraded sample roads will allow improved traffic flow, higher vehicle speeds, and \nshorter travel times. This will lead to a reduction in VOCs and time costs, which will stimulate \neconomic growth and increase traffic along sample roads.  \n64.  An economic assessment (Appendix 12 and Supplementary Appendix H) was conducted \nfor the three individual sample roads and for the sample roads as a whole in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.8 The economic analysis considers the \nestimated costs and benefits over the construction period and 20 years of operation. The costs \ncomprise investment costs and incremental operating costs. The estimated benefits are in terms \nof savings in VOCs and passenger time costs. The estimated EIRR of the overall sample roads \nis 18.0%; the EIRRs of the individual sample roads ranges from 12.7% to 23.4%.  \n65.  Sensitivity analysis was carried out for five scenarios to test the economic viability of the \nProject: (i) capital costs increased by 20%, (ii) benefits decreased by 20%, (iii) exclusion of time \nsavings benefits, (iv) exclusion of generated traffic benefits, and (v) capital costs increased by \n20% and benefits decreased by 20%. Under the worst scenario, the EIRR for the sample roads \nas a whole was 13.1%, above the opportunity cost of capital of 12%, indicating the economic \n                                                 \n8 Economic and Development Resource Center, ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.       \nManila.  \n ", "   15\nviability of the Project.  \n66.  Distribution analysis was undertaken to (i) assess the extent that the direct economic \nbenefits quantified in the economic analysis would accrue to poor people, and (ii) estimate the \npoverty impact ratio for the Project. Estimates were prepared of the distribution of quantified \nbenefits among various categories of road users. A user survey was conducted to establish the \nproportion of the poor among passenger users, freight users, and vehicle owners/operators. \nEstimates of the poor in each of the sample road areas using passenger facilities and freight \nservices varied from 42.5% to 61.4%. The estimated poverty impact ratio was 0.44, indicating \nthat the total net economic benefits reaching the poor is almost 50% of the total net economic \nbenefits of the sample roads.  \nD.  Social Impacts \n  1.  Poverty Reduction and Socioeconomic Impacts \n67.  The districts covered by the Project are the poorest in the country. According to a survey \nin 2003\u20132004, the project roads are located in regions where poverty incidence is high (from \n37.4% to 42.9%) compared with the national average (30.8%). Most of these districts are also \nconsidered food insecure districts. As transportation has been difficult, it has been hard to \nsupply food in time of need or at low cost, and people have been unable to sell agricultural \nproducts to neighboring markets. \n68.  The social survey indicates that better road connectivity will help farmers sell agricultural \nproducts to neighboring markets so that they can grow larger marketable surpluses. It will \nprovide more agricultural employment, particularly benefiting the poor. The Project will also \ncreate employment opportunities for skilled and unskilled labor during implementation. Unskilled \nlabor will be employed directly in road construction and indirectly in providing materials and \nservices for contractors. The Project will enable reliable access to social services, particularly \nhealth care services, education facilities, and supply of drinking water. The direct (access to \nservices and markets) and indirect benefits (employment) of the Project will help reduce poverty \nand improve quality of life. The Project will have limited negative social impact (Appendix 13). \n  2.  Indigenous Peoples \n69.  More than 45% of the population in the 17 districts come from ethnic groups, including \nChepang,  Gurung,  Jirel,  Limbus,  Kala-Rai,  Kumals,  Magar,  Majhis,  Newar,  Rais,  Sherpa, \nSunuwar, Tamang,  and, Thami.  Due to language and cultural criteria used in defining ethnic \ngroups in Nepal, not all ethnic groups are socio or economically marginal. Ethnic groups in the \nproject areas are all integrated into the social, cultural, and economic network of mainstream \nsociety. A detailed social survey conducted in the three sample road sections reveals that the \nethnic groups present are Danuwar and Majhi, and there will be no differential impact on these \ngroups from the dominant local population likely to be adversely affected by the Project. All the \npopulation in the areas will benefit equally from the socioeconomic opportunities created by the \nProject.  Improved  roads  will  increase  ethnic  groups\u2019  access  to  socioeconomic  services. \nTherefore, it is not necessary to prepare an indigenous people\u2019s development plan. Special \nmitigation measures have been included in the resettlement plans (RPs) to provide additional \nassistance to such households in the event of being adversely affected. In addition, if any \nimpact is identified on indigenous people during preparation of non-sample subprojects, an \nindigenous people\u2019s development plan will be prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on \n   ", "16  \nIndigenous  Peoples9  in  line  with  the  indigenous  people\u2019s  development  framework \n(Supplementary Appendix I).  \n  3.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Aspects \n70.  The Project was developed with a view to avoid or minimize the need for land acquisition \nand involuntary resettlement. Road construction will largely follow the existing alignment. The \nroads pass mostly through rural areas and markets where settlements along the road are thinly \npopulated rural dwellings. \n71.  Based on the preliminary technical design, a full census was conducted for the three \nsample roads for all affected persons (APs), land, and structures, assets within the corridor of \nimpact of 8 meters (m), with 4 m on both sides of the existing centerline. The carriageway width \nis about 4.5 m and additional land will be required where government land is not available for \nwidening and realignment. An estimated 212 households and 1,055 persons will be affected by \nthe three sample roads. A total of 163 structures will be affected and seven households may \nlose agricultural land. Other impacts will include loss of community structures and incomes, and \nlivelihoods of tenants and employees. Three RPs for three sample roads have been prepared to \nmitigate various impacts and the summary RP for the three sample roads combined is in \nSupplementary Appendix J. \n72.  The entitlement matrix provides for compensation and resettlement assistance to all APs \nand small businesses, including those without formal title in the project corridor of impact. In \naddition, provision has been made for additional assistance to match the replacement costs of \nlost assets, transaction costs, and other cash grants and resettlement assistance. Households \nheaded by females and other vulnerable households will be eligible for further assistance. The \ntotal estimated cost of resettlement and rehabilitation for the Project is about $0.28 million.  \n73.  MPPW has translated and disclosed the summary RP to APs and local communities in \nlocal languages along the sample roads. In addition, after completion of detailed designs, the \nRPs will be updated on the basis of final alignment and approved by ADB prior to the award of \ncivil  works  contracts.  The  requirements  of ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement10  for \npreparing the sector project required a resettlement framework (RF) for the remaining non-\nsample subprojects (Supplementary Appendix K). MPPW/DOR will prepare an RP for each non-\nsample road based on detailed design in accordance with ADB\u2019s policy and the RF. ADB will \napprove these prior to commencement of civil works. \n  4.  Gender \n74.  The  Project  will  benefit  both  men  and  women  by  providing  (i)  direct  employment \nopportunities  in  construction  activities,  (ii)  easier  access  to  markets,  (iii)  better  delivery  of \nservices,  and  (iv)  improved  access  to  health  care  facilities  and  education.  Focus  group \ndiscussions with women and communities revealed that the majority of respondents supported \nthe construction of the project roads. The civil work contracts will include legally mandated \nprovisions for health; sanitation; and appropriate working conditions (including accommodation, \nwhere appropriate, for construction workers at campsites during the construction period). The \nProject will ensure that (i) civil works contractors comply with all applicable labor laws, including \nelimination of gender-differentiated wages; and (ii) both men and women directly affected by the \n                                                 \n9 ADB.

Manila. \n ", "   17\nProject will be given priority employment by the Project. Contractors will ensure that men and \nwomen will be given equal wages for work of equal value. A specific clause will be included in \nthe bidding documents and compliance will be strictly monitored during project implementation. \nA separate HIV/AIDS prevention and anti-trafficking program will be undertaken in project areas \nto  address  the  potential  risks  of  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  threats  that  could  be \naggravated by increased connectivity of the project areas. \n  5.  HIV/AIDS and Human Trafficking \n75.  A HIV/AIDS prevention and anti-trafficking program has been prepared to (i) reduce the \nvulnerability of risk groups to HIV/AIDS and trafficking, and (ii) increase access to HIV/AIDS \nprevention services. Beneficiaries include road construction workers, transport drivers, female \nsex workers, migrants, populations living along the road corridors, and DOR project staff. The \nfirst phase of work will be carried out in the three sample road sections. Based on lessons \nlearned, preventive activities for the HIV/AIDS and anti-trafficking program will be identified for \nthe remaining road sections.  \n76.  The HIV/AIDS and anti-trafficking program will comprise (i) capacity strengthening of \nlocally  based  NGOs  to  undertake  HIV/AIDS  and  anti-trafficking  awareness  activities; \n(ii) information,  education,  and  communication  on  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  anti-trafficking \nthrough mass media and bill boards; (iii) advocacy actions on HIV/AIDS prevention and anti-\ntrafficking to be organized through workshops targeting local resident communities, contractors \ninvolved in the road construction, transportation companies; and (iv) design of a HIV/AIDS \nprevention and anti-trafficking information campaign to be implemented along the project areas \nonce opened to traffic.  \nE.  Environment Impact \n77.  The overall Project is classified as category A because some roads may pass through \nenvironmentally  sensitive  areas  such  as  a  national  park.  Other  roads  may  involve  only \ninsignificant physical interventions in terms of road condition improvement; they will be category \nB subprojects which require only initial environmental examination (IEE) reports. The Project is \nsubject to the Government\u2019s Environmental Protection Rules, 1997. Environmental assessment \nreports are required to obtain government environmental clearances before commencing civil \nworks of relevant sections. These will be granted by the Ministry of Environment, Science and \nTechnology (MOEST) for category A subprojects and by MPPW for category B roads. MOEST \nwill approve the environmental impact assessment (EIA) for category A subprojects and MPPW \nwill approve IEEs for category B subprojects.   \n78.  To comply with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy,11 the environmental impacts of three sample \nroads were assessed by undertaking IEEs for Phidim\u2013Taplejung and Tamakoshi\u2013Manthali\u2013\nKhurkot,  and  an  EIA  for  Galchi\u2013Trisuli\u2013Dhunche-Syaphrubesi.  The  first  two  sample  roads \ninvolve  (i)  widening  the  existing  4.5  m  road  to  single-lane  standard  roads;  (ii)  improving \ndrainage;  (iii)  rehabilitating  culverts;  (iv)  constructing  causeways;  and  (v)  improving  road \nalignment,  bioengineering,  landscape,  and  road  accessories.  The  EIA  for  Galchi\u2013Trisuli\u2013\nDhunche-Syaphrubesi was undertaken since about 30 km of the road passes through Lantang \nNational Park. Except for the potential environmental impacts to Lantang National Park, the \noverall environmental impacts of the sample roads were mostly related to construction works \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2002. The Asian Development Bank Environment Policy. Manila. \n   ", "18  \nsuch as increased dust, noise, volatile gas due to hot-mix plants, and loss of roadside trees. \nThe summary environmental impact assessment (SEIA) covers (i) two IEEs and one EIA for \nsample roads, and (ii) the environmental assessment and review framework (EARF) for non-\nsample roads. The SEIA was publicized on ADB\u2019s website and submitted to the Board on 4 April \n2006. MPPW has granted the environmental clearance of Phidim\u2013Taplejung and Tamakoshi\u2013\nManthali\u2013Khurkot  sample  roads  (category  B).  MOEST  environmental  clearance  of  Galchi\u2013\nTrisuli\u2013Dhunche-Syaphrubesi sample road (category A) is in process.  \n79.  Generally, the Project is not expected to have adverse environmental impacts, according \nto  environmental  assessment  studies  for  sample  roads  which  portray  all  generic  potential \nenvironmental impacts related to civil works. The sample road that passes through the buffer \nzone of Lantang National Park (about 30 km) is not expected to have a long-term ecological \nimpact  because  (i)  the  roadside  area  has  no  precious  ecological  value  according  to  the \necological survey, and (ii) the width of the road within Lantang National Park will not be widened. \nRecommended  mitigation  measures  for  the  sample  roads,  presented  in  the  environmental \nmanagement plans (EMPs), will be strictly implemented. DOR will be responsible for carrying \nout and monitoring the overall implementation of such measures, through the Geology and \nEnvironmental  Unit.  Civil  works  contractors  will  implement  the  mitigation  measures  at  the \nconstruction stage.  \n80.  The  EIA\u2019s  of  other  roads  will  be  prepared  and  reviewed  by  following  the  EARF \n(Supplementary Appendix L), which is formulated to ensure that all other roads will be prepared \nto meet the policy requirements of the Government and ADB.  \nF.  Project Risks \n81.  ADB\u2019s  portfolio  performance  in  Nepal  improved  in  2005,  as  reflected  in  increased \ncontract  awards  and  disbursement,  in  spite  of  very  challenging  circumstances  caused  by \nescalation of the security conflict since 2000. The Project has been carefully formulated to \nmanage and mitigate risks. Advance recruitment will help expedite consultant mobilization. The \nPIU will be appropriately staffed. NGOs will be selected and engaged to help implement land \nacquisition, the RP, and the HIV/AIDS and anti-trafficking program. The consultant will help \nprocure  land  and  monitor  project  implementation.  ADB  will  rigorously  monitor  project \nimplementation  and  technical  auditing  throughout  the  project  period  through  intensive \ninteractions with the Government, MPPW, and other funding agencies. Negative environmental \nimpacts will be mitigated through the detailed mitigation measures set out in the SEIA, which will \nbe further monitored by consultant. The Government reassures the Project\u2019s priority I status of \nstarting in FY2006/07 in terms of budget allocation, particularly the cost of land acquisition and \nresettlement. \n82.  The Project has been prepared in full consultation with all local communities which is \nexpected to pass information to all parties in respect of the potential benefits of the Project to \nthe local poor people. A security assessment was carried out during project preparation. Local \ncommunities, including participants believed to be or related to insurgents, expressed support \nfor the Project. Lessons learned by major funding agencies active in Nepal, including ADB, have \nbeen incorporated in the project design. In the past, pro-poor projects had much better chance \nof being less disturbed by the insurgency. Risk mitigation measures include (i) overprogramming \ncandidate  roads,  (ii)  encouraging  employment  of  local  contractors,  (iii)  incorporating  an \nadequate construction period in civil works contracts, and (iv) a flexible work program. Maximum \nuse of local unskilled labor will be encouraged by adopting labor-intensive construction methods \nof  construction  as  much  as  practicable. All  these  measures  are  expected  to  help  project \n ", "   19\nimplementation.  \n83.  The recent political development and newly declared cease-fire by the Government and \ninsurgents  provide  reasonable  hope  for  cautious  optimism  for  safe  and  effective  project \nimplementation.  The  Government  confirmed  the  Project\u2019s  priority  and  its  commitment  to \ncontinue  project  implementation,  including  all  agreed  assurances  in  the  report  and \nrecommendation of the President and financing agreement. However, a cautious approach will \nbe adopted and a security assessment will be carried out in the process of contract award and \napproval of non-sample roads. This will prioritize sections that are considered capable of being \nimplemented safely and effectively and help in awarding contracts accordingly.12  \nVI.    ASSURANCES \n A.  Specific Assurances  \n84.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and MPPW have given the \nfollowing assurances which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n(i)   Land acquisition and resettlement.

The Government will ensure that DOR shall: (a)  implement \nmitigation measures and EMP for the sample roads and for non-sample roads as \ndescribed in the IEE, EIA, and SEIA reports in accordance with the environmental \nlaws  and  regulations  of  Nepal  and    ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002);  (b) \nimplement  the  EARF  for  the  non-sample  roads;  (c)  obtain  all  necessary \nenvironmental statutory clearance and forest clearance prior to commencement \nof  civil  works  contract;  (d)  implement  and  monitor,  on  a  timely  basis,  all \nconditions attached to these clearances; (e) submit semi-annual reports to ADB \nand other relevant agencies on the implementation of EMP and conditions of \nclearance for \u201cA\u201d category roads and annual report for \u201cB\u201d category roads as part \nof the progress report on project implementation; (f) submit SEIA to ADB for \u201cA\u201d \ncategory roads to be disclosed to public through ADB\u2019s website at least 120 days \nprior  to  sub-project  approval;  and  (g)  provide  the  contractors  with  the \nenvironmental assessment reports including EMP, and ensure that contractors \nimplement  the  required  mitigation  measures  and  EMP  as  described  in  such \nreports. \n (iii)  Governance.    The  Government  will,  in  addition  to  its  application  of ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998),  undertake  other  measures  to  ensure  good \ngovernance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  including  (a)  cause  MPPW  to \nengage consultants to conduct technical audit in line with the approved TORs at \nkey project implementation milestones in respect of procurement, payment and \nconstruction quality; and (b) within 12 months of grant effectiveness, establish \n                                                 \n12 A Board information paper on recent developments in Nepal was circulated on 26 May 2006. \n   ", "20  \nand maintain a special website, in a form acceptable to ADB, to track project \nimplementation and administration of funds. \n(iv)  Realignment.  If any major realignment of the sample roads is required, the \nGovernment  will  submit  a  proposal  to  ADB  for  approval  of  the  economic, \nengineering,  environmental  and  social/resettlement  assessment  of  such  a \nchange. The Government will ensure that applicable environment clearance be \nobtained.  RP will be updated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary \nResettlement and submitted to ADB for approval prior to commencing any land \nacquisition and resettlement activities for the realigned section.  \n(v)   Operation and maintenance.  The Government will ensure that (a) DOR will be \nresponsible  for  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  project  roads  through \nproper technical supervision and adequate allocation of funds; and (b) additional \nbudgetary allocations are made available for periodic maintenance of at least 500 \nkm  of  SRN  each  fiscal  year  from  FY2007/08\u20132012/13  and  thereafter  all \nmaintainable roads required as per road conditions. \n(vi)  Road  safety  and  overloading.    The  Government  will  make  effective  and \nimplement its Heavy Vehicle Management Policy, ensure the use of weighing \nbridges  to  monitor  overloading  and  apply  measures  for  load  enforcement, \nincluding imposition of applicable penalties on violators in accordance with this \nPolicy, the Vehicle and Transport Management Act and Public Roads Act of \nNepal.  DOR  shall  provide  an  annual  report  to  ADB  on  the  status  of  load \nenforcement measures, incidence of vehicle overloading, and other agreed upon \nbenchmarks. \n(vii)  HIV/AIDS and anti-trafficking. The Government will ensure that all civil works \ncontracts  reflect  the  need  for  an  information  and  education  campaign  on \nHIV/AIDS and anti-trafficking of women and children as part of the health and \nsafety program.   \n(viii)   Labor laws. The Government will ensure that the civil works contractors comply \nwith all applicable labor laws and regulations of Nepal and, in particular, (a) do \nnot  employ  child  labor  for  construction  and  maintenance  activities,  and  (b) \nprovide  appropriate  facilities  for  children  at  construction  campsites.  The \nGovernment will set employment targets for women and low caste workers for \nconstruction activities and require contractors not to differentiate wages between \nmen  and  women  for  work  of  equal  value. The  Government  will  ensure  that \nspecific clause will be included in bidding documents to ensure adherence to \nthese provisions and that compliance will be strictly monitored during project \nimplementation. \nB.  Conditions for Award of Civil Works Contract \n85.  The Government shall not award any civil works contract financed under the grant \nunless it has - \n \n(i)  obtained approval of ADB to the RPs for Non-sample Roads, based on detailed \ndesign, prepared in accordance with ADB's Policy on Involuntary Resettlement \n(1995) and the RF, and disclosed to the affected persons (APs) in the local \nlanguage; \n \n ", "   21\n(ii)  obtained approval of ADB to the RPs for Sample Roads, updated on the basis of \nthe final alignment after completion of detailed design, and disclosed to the APs \nin the local language; \n \n(iii)  obtained approval of ADB, in case of any impact on indigenous people,  to the \nindigenous peoples development plan prepared and implemented in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998), and as set out in the agreed \nindigenous peoples development framework;   \n \n(iv)  provided to ADB the environment assessment report including environmental \nmanagement plan in accordance with ADB's Environmental Policy (2002) prior to \nits approval of the subprojects; and  \n \n(v)  acquired  or  made  available  the  land  and  rights  in  land  free  from  any \nencumbrances, and cleared any obstruction relating to the first section required \nto be handed over for commencement of construction in accordance with the \nwork schedule proposed under the relevant civil works contract. \n \n86.

Sector Profile \n1.  Nepal\u2019s transport infrastructure mainly consists of roads and civil aviation. Roads carry \nabout 90% of all passengers and freight within the country. A key part of Nepal\u2019s road system \nis the strategic road network (SRN). The national highways consist of the East\u2013West Highway \nand north\u2013south highways, linking major towns and serving much of the population. The East\u2013\nWest Highway stretches from Gaddachauki at the western border with India, to Kakarbhitta at \nthe  eastern  border  with  India,  runs  the  length  of  the  country  across  the  Terai,  and  is \nconnected through north\u2013south links to Kathmandu. The Tribhuvan highway is also vital, \nconnecting Birganj at the southern border with India, the country\u2019s most important trade \nborder, to Kathmandu.  \n2.  Road transport is the dominant mode for moving passenger and freight traffic in Nepal\u2019s \ntransport sector. However, road density is low at 11.40 kilometers (km) of road per 100 square \nkilometers (km2) and 0.71 km per 1,000 population\u2014less than that in neighboring countries. \nThis is mainly due to the country\u2019s complex topography and insufficient resources, which \nresult in lack of road access for about 4 million Nepalese. This problem is particularly acute in \nthe north and western remote hilly areas and contributes to rural poverty. \nB.  Road Network \n3.  The national road network comprises national highways, feeder roads, urban roads, \ndistrict roads, and village roads. The national highways and feeder roads form the SRN, which \nis the backbone of the national road network. Construction and maintenance of the SRN is the \nresponsibility of the Department of Roads (DOR). District roads and village roads form the \ndistrict road network. In 2002, the national road network had a total of 16,834 km of roads, \ncomprising 4,861 km (29%) of strategic roads, 2,198 km (13%) of urban roads, and 9,775 km \n(58%) of district roads. Feeder Roads totaled 2,034 km in length. These roads form the major \nconnections  from  national  highways  to  district  headquarters.  However,  15  district \nheadquarters  are  not  connected  by  road.  About  two  thirds  of  the  road  network  remains \nunpaved and much remains impassable during the wet season, especially in hilly areas. \nC.  Traffic and Vehicle Fleet \n4.  An important feature of road transport within Nepal is the relatively low traffic volume. \nOutside Kathmandu Valley, the highest volumes are 2,500\u20133,000 vehicles per day (vpd) on \nthe main route to the border with India. On key links in the Terai, volumes are 300\u20131,000 vpd, \nwith flows of 100\u2013200 vpd on the main hill roads. Earth roads at the extremities of the network \nmay have traffic volumes of less than 25 vpd. Except around Kathmandu, where cars are \ncommon, traffic is still dominated by buses and trucks and, increasingly, motorcycles. The \nregistered motor vehicle fleet in 2005 comprised 432,264 units. This represents an average \nannual growth rate of about 13%, with the highest growth in motorcycles.   \nD.  Transport Planning and Coordination \n5.  The  National  Planning  Commission  sets  overall  development  objectives  and \ncoordinates the investment programs of external agencies and government agencies. The \nMinistry of Physical Planning and Works (MPPW) has prime responsibility for planning and \nformulating policies; and managing all land transport facilities, including roads and bridges. \nThe Ministry of Local Development (MLD) is responsible for district roads.  \n   ", " 2 6      Appendix 2   \n6.  Within MPPW, DOR is responsible for network planning, design, construction, and \nmaintenance of the SRN; municipalities are responsible for urban roads. The Department of \nTransport Management (DOTM) within the Ministry of Labor and Transport Management is \nresponsible for regulating road transport, including vehicle registration and licensing. The \nDepartment of Local Infrastructure Development and Agricultural Roads (DOLIDAR), within \nMLD,  is  responsible  for  (i)  coordinating  and  facilitating  rural  infrastructure  development \nthroughout the country, and (ii) providing technical guidance and support at the local level. \nE.  Capacity Building \n7.  Substantial  efforts  have  been  under  way  through  partnerships  between  the \nGovernment and various external funding agencies, as part of ongoing projects, to help DOR \nimprove its road management capacity, planning and monitoring capability, and environmental \nand traffic safety practices. DOR has been able to develop and improve its basic capabilities \nto improve its management of the road capital and resources allocated to the sector.  \n8.  The Department for International Development of the United Kingdom and the Swiss \nAgency for Development and Cooperation have assisted in establishing and supporting new \nunits to strengthen DOR\u2019s functions, including (i) Maintenance and Rehabilitation Coordination \nUnit, which prepared various departmental policies; (ii) Road Sector Skill Development Unit; \n(iii) Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Unit;  and  (iv)  Geo-environmental  Unit.  The  World  Bank \nundertook a mechanical branch review, carried out management information system and IT \nneeds study, prepared training management guidelines, and assisted in establishing Roads \nBoard Nepal (RBN) in 2002. ADB assisted in the introduction of resealing practices in 1987. \nOther important achievements by ADB were (i) technical assistance, including the Road and \nRoad Transport Institutional Development Project, which led to the establishment of the Office \nof the Chief Technical Examiner in MPPW; and (ii) preparation of public works directives \n(PWD) under the Strengthening Project Implementation Practices1 project. Establishment of a \ntechnical audit system under this project is an important ongoing ADB program at the National \nVigilance Centre. \n9.  Ongoing capacity building activities include planned maintenance for SRN under DOR, \nassisted by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation; and introducing the length \nworker system for routine maintenance at the divisional office level since 1993. The World \nBank has continued involvement in capacity building and institutional strengthening of DOR \nthrough an institutional strengthening component. An ongoing study contains an extensive \ncapacity building and institutional strengthening component, including (i) preparation of a long-\nterm  institutional  strategy  for  the  SRN,  (ii)  comprehensive  DOR  corporate  planning  and \nperformance management, (iii) DOR planning and management using efficient information \ntechnology and a management information system, (iv) effective monitoring and evaluation \ncapacity, and (v) improved project financial management.  \n10.  Support for capacity building of DOLIDAR and local bodies in the road sector has only \nbegun  recently.  The  Department  for  International  Development  has  been  focusing  on \nimproving the capacity of institutions associated with rural infrastructure development and has \nsupported DOLIDAR and local bodies in infrastructure planning. The German Development \nCooperation,  through  Germany  Technology  Cooperation  (GTZ),  also  has  contributed  by \nestablishing  a  maintenance  mechanism  for  rural  roads  and  preparing  Rural  Road \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Nepal for the Strengthening Project Implementation  \n  Practices. Manila. . \n ", "    Appendix 2  27\nMaintenance Manual in Nepal in 2005. A new institutional strengthening program in the rural \nroads sector is being funded by the World Bank under the Institutional Strengthening Action \nPlan  for  Local  Infrastructure  Development  Sector,  Rural  Access  Improvement  and \nDecentralization Project. \n11.  Many programs have been carried out by international funding agencies, including \nADB. However, DOR still needs capacity building in certain areas, including (i) feasibility study \nmethodology,  especially  economic,  social,  and  environmental  assessment;  (ii)  contract \nmanagement; and (iii) quality assurance systems. \n12.  The Government has given priority to routine and recurrent road maintenance of the \nSRN over recent years. Three roads in Nepal are tolled. At least 70% of the tolls will be \nexclusively  used  for  routine  and  recurrent  maintenance  of  tolled  roads.  Tolling  must  be \napproved by the Government through RBN.  \nF.  Road Transport Services \n1.  Road Passenger Services \n13.  Operators of road passenger services are privately owned. The bus transport industry \nis regulated by DOTM at all levels. All bus operators must be registered as an individual or \ncompany.  Buses  are  checked  every  6  months  for  roadworthiness.  Tourist  buses  are \nregistered separately and are limited to carrying tourists only.  \n14.  For all-weather roads, DOTM designates the bus routes and issues route permits. \nThere are no conditions on these route permits. Maximum fares for a particular route are set \nby DOTM on a route basis, and take account of road pavement type and existing peak bus \nloadings. Changes in bus fares are not immediately responsive to changes in operating \nconditions. Routes and fares are agreed between bus operators and village development \ncommittees where DOTM has not specified a route. Proposals for new services come from \noperators or village development committees.  \n2.  Road Freight Services \n15.  Commercial vehicles must be licensed by DOTM to operate. There are two types of \nroute permits for freight traffic: (i) for a specific route, and (ii) countrywide. All route permits \nmust be renewed every 4 months. DOTM also approves maximum freight rates. \n16.  The  road  freight  transport  industry,  which  carries  over  90%  of  freight  traffic,  is \ndominated by private operators who are mostly owner-drivers. Most of these operators are \nmembers of transport associations, although a growing number of independent operators \ncompete for loads and keep the market competitive. \n17.  Freight rates reflect the condition of the road. Rates on unpaved sections in hilly or \nmountainous terrain are NRs15\u2013NRs25 per ton-km, compared with around NRs3\u2013NRs10 per \nton-km on paved sections in flat terrain. This general link between road condition and freight \nrates is seen in all areas. \nG.  Government\u2019s Road Sector Plan \n18.  Since the 1970s, the Government\u2019s main objective in the road subsector has been the \ncompletion of the SRN as well as integrating the country. Improved access and reduced \n   ", " 2 8      Appendix 2   \ntransport costs are expected to stimulate economic development, particularly in agriculture. \nThis will help reduce regional disparities.  \n19.  The main objectives of the 10th five-year plan in the road sector are to (i) develop and \nmanage the road transport network to support socioeconomic development, and (ii) promote \nprivate sector participation in the construction of new road networks and maintenance. Major \nstrategies  include  (i)  increased  private  sector  participation  in  road  construction  and \nmaintenance, (ii) enhanced institutional capacities of DOR and the private sector to ensure \ncost-effective sustainability of the road network, and (iii) transferring the responsibility for rural \nroads to local government. \n20.  To encourage increased private sector involvement, legislation will be enacted for \nimplementation of BOT and BOOT policies. An additional 10 district headquarters will be \nconnected by road, increasing the number of district headquarters with road connections to \n70. The private sector will increasingly participate in road construction and maintenance. \nH.  Revenues and Expenditure \n21.  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) provides funds for maintenance of the SRN through \nRBN and DOR. Since the establishment of RBN, it approves DOR\u2019s annual road maintenance \nplan  and  controls  the  part  of  the  budget  funded  by  RNB.  DOR  is  the  planning  and \nimplementation agency for maintenance, and uses other funds such as direct government \nallocation and externally funded projects. RBN\u2019s funding is sourced mainly from fuel levies \n(48.7%), vehicle registration fees (33.5%), and tolls (17.8%). These will be used to maintain all \nroads. The total fund resources were NRs400 million for FY2005/06. Of this, NRs270 million \nwas allocated for SRN roads, NRs49.8 million for urban roads, NRs67.4 million for district \nroads, and NRs13 million for administrative expenses. In addition, the Government provides \nNRs290 million ($4.1 million) to DOR for SRN maintenance. The Government plans to provide \nadequate funding each year to RBN and eventually budget all road maintenance fund through \nRBN. The Government\u2019s budget support for road maintenance will continue until RBN revenue \ncollection can fully meet the road maintenance fund requirement. The Government currently \nprovides full funding for routine, recurrent, and most periodic maintenance. It will provide full \nfunding periodic maintenance of at least 500 km each year from 2006 to 2012 to ensure \nproper  maintenance  of  maintainable  SRN  roads  and  clear  up  all  800  km  of  deferred \nmaintenance.    \n22.  Table A2.1 details Nepal\u2019s road sector expenditure from 2002 to 2004 and planned \nincome and expenditure for 2005, and indicates that revenue for the road sector currently \nrequires foreign assistance. It is anticipated that the transport sector will raise $31 million in \nFY2004/05 from transport related taxes and fees. This is about 45% of the current SRN road \nexpenditure allocation.   \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "    Appendix 2  29\nTable A2.1: Road Sector SRN Budget: FY2004\u20132005 \n($ million) \nItem  Actual  Actual  Allocated Budget  \nExpenditure  Expenditure  FY2004\u20132005 \nFY2002\u20132003  FY2003\u20132004 \n      Total  Government  Grant  Loan \nA.

General \n1.  The roads considered for the program were those listed in the Road Master Plan (2002\u2013\n2022). After initial screening, 20 roads were considered for multi-criteria analysis to prioritize the \nlist and select roads for inclusion in the Program. \nB.  Multi-Criteria Analysis \n2.  The criteria used were as follows (weighting in parentheses): \n(i)  district connectivity (8.3); \n(ii)  economic worth (8.2); \n(iii)  cost per kilometer (6.0); \n(iv)  potential economic development of the zone or district (especially tourism) (8.7); \n(v)  contribution to the transport master plan and country strategy program (6.3); \n(vi)  social issues and poverty reduction (8.0); \n(vii)  environmental impact (negative worth) (5.2); \n(viii)  security considerations (4.9); \n(ix)  population served (6.8); and \n(x)  rural network connected (7.8). \n3.  The roads that ranked highest in the analysis were selected for inclusion in the Program. \nBudget limitations were taken into account to maximize total road length. Road projects that \nwere planned for construction by other funding agencies, but dropped from the prioritized list, \nwere also considered. A total of 490 kilometers (km) of roads were selected. \n4.  Additional roads are included in an expanded list to allow for possible changes in the \noriginal list prior to implementation, particularly as the Government is producing a revised \npriority investment plan. These additional roads, if not finally included in the Program, may be \nincluded in any future projects. \nC.  Sample Road Selection \n5.  General requirements for sample roads were that they should be representative of the \nfinal roads package and, in the case of environment and resettlement, the \u201cworst\u201d end of the \nimpacts. \n6.  Selection of sample roads followed these general principles: \n(i)  It should be reasonably certain that they would be part of the package of roads \nselected for the medium-term plan package after prioritization. \n(ii)  They should include roads which improved access to district headquarters \n(district connectivity). \n(iii)  If any of the prioritized roads were class A environment, then one of the sample \nroads must also be class A. \n(iv)  They should be relatively easily accessible and should not be in an existing \nserious conflict area. \n(v)  There should be some new construction but the majority of the work should be \nupgrading of existing roads. \n ", "  Appendix 4  33 \n     \n    \n7.  Based on the above criteria, three roads were selected: \n(i)  Galchhi\u2013Trishuli\u2013Dhunche\u2013Syaprubesi in the Central Region, \n(ii)  Tamacoshi\u2013Manthali\u2013Kurkhot in the Central Region, and \n(iii)  Phidim\u2013Taplejung in the Eastern Region. \nD.  Medium-Term Road Projects \n8.  The full list of road projects to be included in the medium-term project is in Table A4. The \nfirst three roads are the sample roads that have been assessed and can now proceed to final \ndesign. Roads 4\u201311 are the remaining non-sample roads and one large bridge for the first road \nsector road, requiring feasibility assessment before detailed design; their inclusion will depend \non feasibility, revised cost estimation, and budget. Roads 12\u201316 are additional roads that will \nonly be considered for sector finance if any of the other roads are dropped from the list. Roads \n17\u201325 are the remaining roads to be considered in the overall medium-term plan. \nTable A4: Prioritized Project Roads \nRoad \nDistricts \n   Region  Road  Length \nTraversed \n(km) \n  A.

HIV/AIDS Issues \n1.  Risk behavior is widespread among the mobile population, commercial sex workers, \ninjecting drug users, and young people. Recent studies on highway routes highlight that these \ngroups have a higher risk of being exposed to HIV/AIDS. It is estimated that there were 62,000 \npeople living with HIV/AIDS in Nepal in 2003 and 871 reported AIDS cases by the end of \nMarch 2005. The current estimated HIV infection rate is 0.5% in the economically productive \nage group of 20\u201349, with higher prevalence reported among migrants from remote rural areas of \nNepal. The HIV epidemic has rapidly changed in the last 3 years and recent data show a very \nlow level of HIV awareness and risk perception, especially among women. Most risk areas \ninclude city centers, transport junctions, corridors along highways, and areas where people \nregularly migrate for work. HIV infection has been noted in all regions of the country, although it \nis concentrated in urbanized areas and districts with high labor migration. Areas supplying more \nmigrants such as the midwest and far-west regions are more vulnerable.  \nB.  Trafficking in Women and Children Issues \n2.  Although progress has been made in reducing human trafficking in recent years, Nepal \ncontinues to be a source country for children and women trafficked overseas. They are often \nsubject to abuse and are vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. Reports indicate that internal trafficking is on \nthe rise because of the insurgency, as rural women and children leave to seek employment and \nsecurity in urban centers. \n3.  Accurate data on trafficking is difficult to obtain because of its clandestine nature, and \nreported statistics vary considerably. However, 2001 census data highlights that the proportion \nof male and female absent from the household without a known reason is higher for women \nthan for men, indicating their possibility of being trafficked. The Government has identified 26 \nhigh-priority districts as source areas for trafficking and established anti-trafficking vigilance \ncommittees. High-risk areas for trafficking include cities, markets, highway bus junctions or \nareas to or from where migration takes place, areas with low literacy. Girls and women aged 11\u2013\n25 and boys aged 6\u201312 are most vulnerable to trafficking.   \nC.  External Assistance to HIV/AIDS and Anti-Trafficking   \n4.  In  Nepal,  there  are  more  than  50  domestic  and  international  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) working in HIV/AIDS prevention, and 57 NGOs working in anti-trafficking \nactivities, in addition to United Nations agencies and government efforts. The National Center \nfor  AIDS  and  Sexually  Transmitted  Disease  (STD)  Control,  under  the  Ministry  of  Health, \ncoordinates the activities of all stakeholders in fulfilling commitments made in the National AIDS \nStrategy (2002\u20132006) which emphasizes prevention as the mainstay for an effective response. \nAnti-trafficking activities are coordinated by the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare.  \n5.  The largest funding agency for HIV/AIDS and anti-trafficking initiatives is the United \nStates Agency  for  International  Development.  In  terms  of  financial  and  human  resources, \ninternational  assistance  has  contributed  significantly  toward  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  anti-\ntrafficking.   \n \n   ", " 3 6      Appendix 5   \n6.  Awareness programs on anti-trafficking initiatives have reached 49 districts and there is \na rich resource of information, education, and communications materials on anti-trafficking. Until \nnow,  the  major  focus  has  been  on  awareness  raising,  advocacy,  networking,  and  social \nmobilization. Most anti-trafficking work has taken place in the Terai districts; the hill districts have \nreceived the least attention. All support is geared toward assisting the Government to implement \nits  national  action  plan  against  trafficking  in  children  and  women  for  sexual  and  labor \nexploitation. Campaigns are made to target potential victims and deter traffickers by advertising \n20-year punishment for trafficking. Such efforts are reported to have resulted in the interception \nand rescue of potential victims. The police have established women\u2019s cells in 17 districts, which \nhave helped control crime and improve investigation, protect women and children, and assist \nrescue efforts. \nD.  Existing Situation of HIV/AIDS and Human Trafficking in the Project Districts   \n7.  Of the project areas, roads in the far-west and midwest regions have been identified as \nhighly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS and human trafficking because of the high level of male out-\nmigration to overseas for seasonal employment. Until now, HIV/AIDS prevention activities have \nbeen  limited  to  awareness  of  schoolteachers,  with  limited  funds.  The  Project\u2019s  social \nassessment, conducted along the three sample road areas, reports a very low level of HIV \nawareness and risk perception, especially among women. The districts in the central region are \ntrafficking-prone districts.  \nE.  The Proposed HIV/AIDS and Anti-Trafficking Program for the Project  \n8.  The objective of the HIV/AIDS and Anti-Trafficking Program is to reduce the vulnerability \nof population groups who are at risk of HIV/AIDS and trafficking, and increase access to HIV \nprevention services. Beneficiaries include road construction workers, transport drivers, female \nsex workers, migrants, populations living along the road corridors, locally based government \nemployees,  and  Department  of  Roads  (DOR)  project  staff.  The  program  will  include \n(i) increasing the level of awareness about prevention of HIV/AIDS and trafficking among the \ndifferent communities, especially vulnerable and high-risk groups; and (ii) developing effective \nprocedures to prevent AIDS and trafficking along the project areas. \n9.  The HIV/AIDS awareness campaign includes key activities such as (i) orientation and \nsensitization  of  project  personnel;  (ii)  HIV/AIDS  awareness  raising  for  contractors  and \nconstruction workers; (iii) a public awareness campaign and behavioral change of high-risk \ngroups; (iv) condom promotion; and (v) networking with testing, counseling, and treatment \nservices. Information will be distributed by NGOs regarding the nearest available services for \ntesting, counseling, and treatment. \n10.  To address the risks and concerns of trafficking, sensitization will be created in the \nproject areas including (i) sensitization and capacity building of project personnel; and (ii) public \nawareness raising. NGOs will perform the awareness raising among the public and target \ngroups through the media and information, education, and communications materials.  \nF.  Linkages with Existing Programs on HIV/AIDS and Anti-trafficking \n11.  The proposed activities along the project areas are fully supported by active funding \nagencies including the United States Agency for International Development and Joint United \nNations Programme on HIV/AIDS in this field. Assistance from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) will be carefully aligned with the resources of other funding agencies to complement \n ", "  Appendix 5  37 \n     \n    \nexisting work in HIV/AIDS prevention and anti-trafficking and avoid duplication. The Government \nrecognizes  HIV/AIDS  as  a  crosscutting  development  theme.  The  Project  provides  an \nopportunity to (i) link the transport sector with already existing HIV/AIDS prevention programs in \nsupport of the National AIDS Strategy, and (ii) increase access to HIV/AIDS services and care. \nTherefore, the introduction of grant financing provides new opportunities for ADB to collaborate \nand harmonize HIV/AIDS and anti-trafficking interventions with a wide range of stakeholders \nand beneficiaries, on a district-by-district basis and in the project districts, leading to enhanced \neffectiveness of the Project. \nG.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The program will be financed through Asian Development Fund IX (ADF IX) grant funds \nestimated  at  the  equivalent  of  $200,000. The  Program  will  be  administered  by ADB. The \nGovernment  will  provide  office  accommodation,  counterpart  staff,  and  other  miscellaneous \nexpenditures.   \nH.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The program will be executed over a period of 3 years. The Ministry of Physical Planning \nand Works (MPPW) will be the Executing Agency and DOR will be the Implementing Agency. \nThe project implementation unit (PIU) will implement the program. An individual domestic social \ndevelopment  consultant  with  expertise  in  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  anti-trafficking  will  be \nengaged by MPPW for 36 person-months over the project period. \n \n14.  The  consultant  will  support  DOR  for  overall  implementation  and  monitoring  of  the \nprogram, and be responsible for identification of suitable NGOs to be engaged by MPPW and \nfinanced from the program for implementation at DOR local field offices. The consultant shall \ncarry out proper financial management and procurement of services from NGOs, civil society, \nand private firms selected on a competitive basis. The consultant shall be subject to monitoring \nfrom the feasibility study, design, and construction supervision consultant. Separate account will \nbe  established  and  managed  under  the  PIU,  and  subject  to  overall  project  auditing \nrequirements. The selection criteria of NGOs will include experience in HIV/AIDS and anti-\ntrafficking initiatives, familiarity with the project sites and districts, and sensitivity to gender \nissues. Recruitment of the consultant and NGOs requires prior approval from ADB.  \n15.  In the first phase, the program will be implemented in three road corridors. Based on \nlessons learned, preventive activities for HIV/AIDS prevention and anti-trafficking activities will \nbe identified for the remaining road sections.   \nI.  Reporting, Monitoring, and Evaluation \n16.  The  consultant  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  an  inception  report  and  quarterly \nprogress reports to be submitted to ADB and DOR. The consultant, through the PIU, will liaise \nwith  DOR  field  offices  for  overall  monitoring  and  supervision.  In  addition  to  regular ADB \nsupervision, the program will be reviewed in detail during the project midterm review mission to \nassess progress and agree on any changes in scope or implementation arrangements. Two \nmonths prior to the midterm review, the consultant will submit to ADB a detailed status report on \nimplementation of the program.  \n \n   ", " 3 8      Appendix 6   \nHIV/AIDS AND ANTI-TRAFFICKING DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \nDesign  Performance Targets/Indicators  Data Sources/   Assumptions  \nSummary  Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact       \n\u2022 Vulnerability of  \u2022 Reduction in HIV-sero prevalence in the  \u2022 NCASC national  \u2022 Social disturbance, \npopulation groups  general population and vulnerable  and district level  political instability, or \nwho are at risk of  subgroups in the project area  statistics  natural disasters do not \nHIV/AIDS and      affect the project areas. \ntrafficking because of  \u2022 Reduction in the number of trafficking  \u2022 MWCSW   \nincreased road  cases among the general population  national and \nconnectivity is  and vulnerable groups in the project  district level \nreduced  area  statistics \n   \n\u2022 HIV/AIDS and anti-trafficking issues  \u2022 Progress reports \nintegrated in future road projects   \n \nOutcome       \n\u2022 The risk of HIV/AIDS  \u2022 HIV/AIDS and anti-human trafficking  \u2022 Surveys of  \u2022 Strong coordination of \ntransmission HIV/AIDS  awareness reached 90% of target groups target groups  DOR, NCASC, Ministry \nis reduced among      of Health, MWCSW, and \nconstruction workers,  \u2022 70% among target groups practice safe  \u2022 Condom sales  relevant district level \nlocal resident  behavior   (baseline  authorities  \ncommunities, vulnerable    determined   \ngroups (women and  \u2022 Increased access to HIV and anti- through sales  \u2022 Adequate financing \nchildren), ethnic groups,  trafficking prevention services  data in year 1 of  mechanisms, availability \ncommercial sex    the Project)   of funds, and timely \nworkers, truck drivers,  \u2022 Capacity of DOR and other relevant    payments to project \nand migrants in the  agencies related to HIV/AIDS and anti- \u2022 Progress reports  implementation partners \nproject area.  trafficking increased     and NGOs \n   \n \n\u2022 Increased risk of human \n \ntrafficking in the project \nareas is reduced. \n \nOutputs       \n1.

Economic  evaluation  of  the  three  sample  roads  (Galchhi\u2013Syaphrubesi,  Tamakoshi\u2013\nKhurkot, and Phidim\u2013Taplejung), which represent an overall sample of about 46% of the roads \nto be implemented under the Project, was carried out using the economic evaluation model \n(ECEVAL). Benefits to the road users were estimated by comparing the differences between the \ncosts in the without-project scenario with those in the with-project scenario for each of the \nsample roads. The without-project case in the economic evaluation represents the current \nsituation. The with-project case is represented by improving the roads to all-weather standard. \nImproved roads will reduce vehicle operating costs (VOCs) and time costs, which stimulate \neconomic growth, resulting in increased traffic along the project roads. The ECEVAL compared \nthe annual streams of economic capital and operating costs and benefits, and computed the \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR). All costs and benefits were expressed in 2005 constant \nprices. The analysis period is for the construction period followed by 20 years of operation.  \nB.  Road Condition and Traffic \n1.  Road Condition \n2.  The  existing  road  condition  for  the  three  sample  roads  has  been  investigated  by \ntopographic, pavement condition, and roughness surveys. Based on traffic flow and pavement \ncondition, the sample roads were divided into homogeneous sections. The average surface \nroughness level for the existing sample roads, in accordance with the International Roughness \nIndex (IRI), are in Table A12.1. \nTable A12.1: Sample Roads and Road Condition Data \nRoad   Description  Distance  Average Roughnessa \n(km)  (m/km) \n1  Galchhi\u2013Syaphrubesi  89.0    16.0 \n2  Tamakoshi\u2013Khurkot     55.0    19.0 \n3  Phidim\u2013Taplejung  83.0    17.0 \n     km = kilometer, m = meter. \n                          a International Roughness Index. \n                  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n2.  Traffic Volume \n3.  Traffic volume on the sample roads was measured at various locations. Each traffic \ncount was taken for three days for a 12-hour period. Origin\u2013destination counts were also \nundertaken at some traffic survey stations. These survey results were normalized through the \napplication of seasonal factors to obtain annual average daily traffic for the base year. The \ntraffic counts were split into seven vehicle categories: (i) car/jeep/pickups, (ii) light bus, (iii) \nheavy bus, (iv) light truck, (v) heavy truck, (vi) tractor, and (vii) motorcycles. Traffic volumes on \nthe sample roads ranged from 27 to 168 vehicles per day. The average traffic composition \nshowed that there were approximately 60% passenger vehicles and 40% freight vehicles.  \n3.   Traffic Growth Rate Assumptions \n4.  Traffic growth rates were based on an analysis of various parameters. Gross domestic \n ", "  Appendix 12  53 \n     \n    \nproduct (GDP) growth was examined and future growth was estimated.1 The income elasticity of \ntransport demand was used to determine the traffic growth rate for each vehicle category. The \ntraffic growth rates adopted varied between 4%to10% per annum depending on vehicle type \nand year. Based on the average vehicle composition for the sample roads, the overall growth \nrate is about 6% for 2005\u20132011, 8% for 2012\u20132021, and 7% beyond 2021.  \nC.  Costs \n5.  Economic costs were derived from financial costs and include cost of construction, and \noperation and maintenance (O&M). Economic costs exclude price contingencies, taxes, duties, \nand  interest  during  construction. A  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.90  was  calculated  and \napplied to the financial costs of non-traded inputs to calculate economic prices. A shadow wage \nrate factor (SWRF) of 0.70 was used to obtain the economic costs of unskilled labor. The \nsample roads are expected to have an average economic life of 20 years. Incremental O&M \ncosts  were  calculated  as  the  difference  between  the  maintenance  requirements  for  the \nproposed new roads and the existing road. In both the without- and with-project scenarios, \nroutine maintenance and periodic surface renewal will be required.  \nD.  Benefits \n6.  The upgraded sample roads will allow improved traffic flow, higher vehicle speeds, and \nshorter travel times. The major economic benefits to the users of the sample roads were \nquantified in terms of (i) VOC savings arising from a reduction in the operating cost of vehicles \ncaused by improvement in the road surface condition, and (ii) time savings resulting from \nshorter trips along each of the sample roads. Typical VOCs of various vehicle types based on \nthe existing surface roughness and the opening year surface roughness of the improved roads \nare in Table A12.2. The rate of road deterioration used in the analysis is based on the IRIs that \nexisted before the sample roads are implemented compared with IRIs in the with-project case. \nThe calculation of VOCs because of the road improvement is calculated.  \nTable A12.2:  Vehicle Operating Costs \n(NRs/km) \nWithout  With \nVehicle Type  Project  Project \n(IRI=17)  (IRI=4) \nCar  17.13  11.40 \nLight Bus  15.74  10.12 \nHeavy Bus  26.21  19.72 \nLight Truck  18.77  12.88 \nHeavy Truck  28.17  20.85 \nTractor  8.71  5.88 \nMotorcycle  3.39  2.24 \n                IRI = International Roughness Index, km = kilometer. \n                            Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n7.  Benefits also accrue to generated traffic that is currently deferred from using the road \nbecause of poor conditions. The benefits to generated traffic are calculated by assuming that \nthe demand curve is linear with respect to cost, and the benefit per unit of traffic is half that of \nexisting or normal traffic.  \n                                                 \n1   The future growth rates of GDP were based on ADB. 2005. Asian Development Outlook 2005. Manila. \n   ", "5  4      Appendix 12   \n8.  In addition, passenger time savings resulting from improved road conditions have been \ncalculated for those for whom time has an economic value. The value of time for work or \nbusiness  trips  has  been  valued  in  2005  prices,  and  is  based  on  the  monthly  income  of \npassengers and their working hours per month. Nonwork trips are given no value. Passenger \noccupancy for each vehicle category enables the time savings per vehicle hour to be calculated. \nThe estimated time values are in Table A12.3.  \n \nTable A12.3: Passenger Time Value at Economic Prices \nTime Savings Per Vehicle-Hour \nVehicle Type \n(NRs) \nMotorcycle     3.38 \nCar   150.00 \nSmall Bus    80.00 \nHeavy Bus  160.00 \n                                   Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n9.  Benefits to road users were estimated from the differences between the costs in without-\nproject and with-project cases. The economic analysis was carried out using these VOC values \nin the ECEVAL analysis program. The model was used to estimate the yearly benefits over the \nlife of the investment. The model then compared life cycle costs for the with-project situation \nwith costs for the without-project situation, and computes the net present value (NPV) and \nestimates the EIRR.  \nE.  Economic Internal Rate of Return \n10.  The EIRR was calculated for each of the three sample roads and for the sample roads \nas a whole. The calculated EIRRs are in Table A12.4.  \n \nTable A12.4: Summary of NPV and EIRR for the Sample Roads \nRoad  Description  Length  NPV  EIRR \n(km)  (NRs million)  (%) \n1  Galchhi\u2013Syaphrubesi  89.0  732.9  23.4 \n2  Tamakoshi\u2013Khurkot     55.0  160.0  16.1 \n3  Phidim\u2013Taplejung  83.0  29.1  12.7 \n       Total         922.0  18.0 \n          EIRR = economic internal rate of return, km = kilometer, NPV = net present value. \n            Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \nF.  Sensitivity Analysis  \n11.  The sensitivity of the total of the sample roads EIRR shown in Table A12.4 (i.e., 18%) \nwas analyzed with respect to changes in the benefit and cost streams. The sensitivity tests \nexamined the following scenarios: (i) an increase in construction costs by 20%, (ii) a reduction in \nbenefits by 20%, (iii) the exclusion of the value of time-saving benefits, (iv) the exclusion of \ngenerated traffic benefits, and (v) a combination of an increase in capital costs of 20% and a \nreduction of benefits by 20%.  \n12.  Table A12.5 summarizes the EIRR for the base case and the sensitivity tests. The \neconomic viability under various sensitivity tests show that the sample roads as a whole remain \neconomically viable as the EIRR remains above the opportunity cost of capital of 12%.  \n ", "  Appendix 12  55 \n     \n    \nTable A12.5: Sensitivity Test of Total Sample Roads \nScenario  EIRR \n(%) \n   \nA.

Distribution Analysis and Poverty Impact Ratio \n13.  The economic benefits consist of road user benefits, i.e., VOC savings and time savings. \nThe distribution analysis disaggregates these economic benefits to passenger and freight users, \nvehicle owners/operators, labor,2 and the Government. The following were estimated: (i) how \nmuch of the Project\u2019s benefits for each vehicle category in the analysis will be passed on to the \nvehicle user, and (ii) the ownership of each vehicle category. Field surveys were undertaken \nalong the sample roads; and passengers, drivers, and farmers were interviewed in each district. \nThese surveys yielded a series of assumptions about what will be passed on to the user of the \nservices. The poverty impact ratio was estimated by determining how much of the benefits to \neach class of user are passed on to the poor. \n14.  The estimated direct benefits to the economy in present value (PV) terms for the sample \nroads as a whole are in Table A12.6, using a discount rate of 12%. These simply represent the \nsum of the PV of benefits to passengers, freight users, vehicle owners, and the Government. \nThe poverty impact ratio for the sample roads as a whole is 0.44. The estimated direct benefits \nof the sample roads are NRs2,244.7 million, in PV terms, representing the sum of the PV of \nbenefits to passengers, freight users, vehicle owners, and the Government. The net benefit to \nthe economy as a whole is NRs882.9 million. These are conservative estimates, because only \ndirect benefits have been considered.  \n \n \n                                                 \n2   As some of the projects capital expenditure and maintenance costs will be spent on local labor, unskilled laborers \nwill gain net benefits to the extent that their paid wages are higher than their opportunity cost of labor.   \n   ", "   \n \n5\n6\n \n \n \nTable A12.6: Distribution of Net Benefits and Poverty Impact Ratio    \n(NRs million)   A\np\np\n  e\nn\nItem  Financial  Economic  Economic              d\nix\nPresent  Present  Minus  Passenger  Freight  Vehicle  Labor  Gov/     1\n2\nValue  Value  Financial  Users  Users  Owners    Economy Net   \n                   \nBenefits                   \nRoad  0.0  2,244.7  2,244.7  415.6  559.2  1,228.7    41.1   \nUser  \n                   \nCost                   \nCapital   (1,187.8)  (987.1)  200.7          200.7   \nO&M  (25.0)  (22.7)  2.3          2.3   \nLabor  (502.9)  (352.0)  150.9        150.9     \n                   \nNPV  (1,715.7)  882.9  2,598.6  415.6  559.2  1,228.7  150.9  244.1   \n                   \n                  Gains and Losses  415.6  559.2  1,228.7  150.9  (1,471.6)  882.9 \n                 Proportion of the Poor (%)  50.0  50.0  0.0  80.0  15.0   \n                  Net Benefits for the Poor  207.8  279.6  0.0  120.7  (220.7)  385.9 \n           \n        Poverty Impact Ratio 0.44 \nO&M = operation and maintenance, NPV = net present value. \nNote: The net loss to Government/economy (-1,471.6) is calculated as -1,715.7 + 244.1. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 13  57 \n     \n    \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?   national priority in country poverty \n   \n  partnership agreement?   \n    No    No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Nepal: \nOne of the main reasons for the persistence of poverty is the lack of access to market centers and \ngovernment services (such as education and healthcare), and economic/employment opportunities\u2014\ncaused by poor road condition or lack of roads. The physical exclusion created by such lack of access is \nalso responsible for social exclusion of the poor and other residents in remote areas. In this context, the \nProject is primarily aimed at (i) improving the existing roads to improve the movement of people, goods, \nand  services;  and  (ii)  linking  various  important  trade/tourist/production  centers  and  places  so  that \neconomic activities increase and people, especially in excluded and poverty-stricken places, get access to \nmarket and other essential services. The project is expected to (i) improve access of primary producers, \nsuch as farmers, to market centers where they can get higher prices for their high value perishable \nproducts; (ii) improve people\u2019s mobility so that they can access employment opportunities outside the \ncommunity; (iii) improve access to social services such as education and health; and (iv) reduce travel \ntime cost. Therefore, by removing physical barriers through road networks and improving the policy and \ninstitutional capacity, the Project will improve the overall performance of the road sector\u2014leading to \nreduction in poverty. The proposed roads under the Project pass through poverty-stricken areas and link \ntrade, production, and marketing centers and other locations of economic activities and socioeconomic \nservices. Therefore, the Project will contribute toward poverty reduction. \nB.  Poverty Analysis  Targeting Classification:  General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nThe proposed project covers 17 out of Nepal\u2019s 75 districts. The project districts are located mostly in \nmidwestern hills, central hills, western Terai, and eastern hill regions. The districts covered by the Project \nare considered to be poor districts, except for some roads which are included because they lead to the \nnorth\u2013south connection of trade routes and linkage to district headquarters, also contributing to poverty \nreduction.  \nAccording to the 2004 Nepal Living Standard Survey (NLSS) II, these are the regions where poverty \nincidence is still high\u2014ranging from 37.4% to 42.9% compared with the national average of 30.8%. Most \nof these districts are also considered food insecure districts. Transportation has been difficult because of \nthe poor quality of roads and, in some cases, lack of roads. It has been difficult to supply food in time of \nneed because of increased transportation costs, and people living in these regions have not been able to \nsell agricultural produce to neighboring markets.   \nA  socioeconomic  survey  was  conducted  in  three  sample  roads  (covering  seven  districts)  with  466 \nhouseholds selected randomly in the roads\u2019 direct impact zone. Considering the national poverty line \ndefined by NLSS (NRs7695.7 per capita income per year or $110), 49.4% of the sampled households \nwere under the poverty line. NLSS also specified a poverty line for different regions. Three roads are in the \n\u201crural eastern hills\u201d where a poverty line has been fixed at NRs8,069.6 ($115). Considering this regional \npoverty line, 51.3% of the sample households were found to be below the poverty line. This study shows \nslightly higher poverty incidence in the districts covered by the Project compared with NLSS II\u2019s result \n(42.9% below poverty) for this region. This shows that within the eastern rural hills, districts covered by the \nProject are poorer than the regional average.  \nDuring the survey, the majority of primary stakeholders acknowledged the positive impacts of the various \nelements of the Project. In particular, improved roads and better connectivity will enable farmers to sell \nagricultural produce to neighboring markets and grow larger marketable surpluses. This will provide more \n   ", "58  Appendix 13 \nagricultural wage employment, particularly benefiting the poor. \nThe  Project  will  also  create  employment  opportunities  for  skilled  and  unskilled  labor  during  its \nimplementation.  Unskilled  labor  will  be  employed  directly  in  road  construction,  rehabilitation,  and \nmaintenance; and indirectly in providing materials and services for contractors. The Project will enable \nreliable access to social services, particularly health care services, education facilities, and supply of \ndrinking water. The direct (access to services and market) and indirect benefits (employment) of the \nProject will help to reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of people in these poverty-stricken \ndistricts. The poverty impact ratio (the proportions of net benefits likely to accrue to the poor) of the sample \nroads is estimated at 0.44, indicating that substantial benefits are expected to go to the poor. \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes    No \n \nIs there a participation strategy?    Yes    No \nDuring project preparation, stakeholder meetings were held both at the institutional level in Kathmandu \nand with the community and related agencies in the districts and communities. Meeting and group \ndiscussions were held, and concerns and suggestions were taken into account. The meetings ensured \nparticipation of representatives from all socioeconomic groups in the community. Small meetings and \nfocused group discussions were also held exclusively with vulnerable groups comprising women, the \ndisadvantaged, and indigenous people. \nThe  Project  was  developed  based  on  consultation  with  possible  stakeholders  such  as  government \nagencies, the private sector, chamber of commerce, civil society, the contractor\u2019s association, transport \nassociations, communities, indigenous people and their associations, and women and their associations. \nThe participation of stakeholders in the implementation of the Project has been further emphasized. The \npossibility of including the community\u2014particularly the poor, women, and indigenous people\u2014in the road \nconstruction/improvement has been incorporated. Communities were also consulted to reduce the adverse \nimpacts of the Project in terms of resettlement impact.  \n \nTo understand the concerns of people and various stakeholders in the three sample roads, participatory \ndiscussions and studies (such as focus group discussions, social mapping, and key informant surveys) \nwere held in seven districts. Project affected communities, local leaders, women, indigenous people, \ntraders,  transport  companies,  laborers,  porters,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  civil  society \nmembers, and government agencies were consulted to understand (i) how they felt about the advantages \nand disadvantages of the roads; (ii) how they were going to be negatively affected; (iii) how that could be \nreduced or mitigated; and (iv) how local people, especially the poor, women, and indigenous people, could \nparticipate in the Project. The Project\u2019s beneficiaries unanimously expressed the need for the Project \nprimarily  because  of  its  socioeconomic  benefits.  They  also  made  suggestions  with  regard  to  local \ncommunities\u2019 participation in the Project, especially in form of employment. The creation of work through \nthe Project and employment will reduce the need to out-migrate for cash income.  \nD.  Gender and Development \nThe Project will have no negative gender impacts. The Project will benefit both men and women by \nproviding  them  with  direct  construction  employment  opportunities,  easier  access  to  markets,  better \ndelivery of services, improved social facilities, and improved access to better quality health care facilities \nand higher education. Focus group discussions with women and communities revealed that the majority of \nrespondents supported the construction of the roads The civil work contracts will include legally mandated \nprovisions for health; sanitation; and appropriate working conditions, including accommodation, where \nappropriate, for construction workers at campsites during the construction period. The Project will ensure \nthat  civil  works  contractors  comply  with  all  applicable  labor  laws,  including  elimination  of  gender-\ndifferentiated wages; and people (men and women) directly affected by the Project will be given priority to \nbe employed by the Project. Contractors must not vary the wages of men and women employed for work \nof equal value.
