INTRODUCTION \n1.  Recent consultations between the Government of Indonesia and the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  have  highlighted  the  importance  of  continued  support  for  infrastructure \ndevelopment to sustain inclusive growth. The government\u2019s development strategy includes both \nthe  urban  areas  of  Java  Island,  and  rural  areas  and  islands  in  eastern  Indonesia,  where \ninfrastructure development is very limited. The technical assistance cluster (TAC) will support \nthe government\u2019s efforts to meet its development goals by improving the investment climate, \nassociated  policies  and  institutional  capacity,  for  infrastructure  development.  The  TAC  will \nsupport identified projects by enhancing project preparedness and developing local capacity for \nimproved  project  implementation.  The  government  has  agreed  with  the  impact,  outcome, \noutputs, implementation arrangements, and cost and financing arrangements of the TAC.1 The \ndesign and monitoring framework for the TAC is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Indonesia\u2019s  economy  has  performed  well  since  2005,  with  average  annual  gross \ndomestic product (GDP) growth of 5.7% during 2005\u20132010, and increasing to 6.5% in 2011\u2013\n2012. Sustained economic growth has helped reduce the national poverty incidence to 12.4% in \n2011 from a peak of 24.0% following the Asian financial crisis in 1997. Despite Indonesia\u2019s \nrecent strong economic performance, infrastructure development has lagged, with significant \nconsequences for future growth prospects. The International Monetary Fund estimates that a \nbaseline potential growth rate of 7.1% for 2014\u20132016 could increase to 7.9% if infrastructure \ndevelopment and economic reforms are accelerated.  \n \n3.  There  are  infrastructure  bottlenecks  across  most  sectors,  but  these  are  particularly \nsignificant in the energy, transport, water supply and sanitation (WSS), and urban services \nsectors. Investment in the energy sector by the state-owned power company (Perusahaan \nListrik Negara) and the private sector is inadequate to meet the projected annual 9%\u201310% \nincrease  in electricity  demand. Only  about  68%  of the  population  currently  has  access to \nelectricity,  a  level  significantly  below  Indonesia\u2019s  regional  peers.  Overreliance  on  imported \npetroleum and high energy subsidies together, place a severe burden on government resources \nand limit the availability of funding for infrastructure development. In the WSS sector, only about \n48% of the population has access to safe drinking water (compared to a 2015 target of 69%). \nSimilarly, only 51% of the population has access to basic sanitation (compared to a 2015 target \nof 62%). Investment in the roads sector has returned to the pre-1997 financial crisis level of \n1.6% of GDP, but is nevertheless inadequate to keep pace with the increasing demand.  \n \n4.  A number of factors constrain infrastructure development in Indonesia. Following the \n1997  Asian financial  crisis, the government focused  on  rehabilitating  and  restructuring the \nfinancial sector to consolidate its fiscal position and reduce high public debt. This contributed to \na reduction in infrastructure spending from pre-crisis levels of 5%\u20137% of GDP to a current level \nof  2.5%\u20134%  of  GDP.  The  decentralization  process  launched  in  2001  largely  transferred \nresponsibility  for  infrastructure  provision  to  local  government,  and  the  central  government \nretained responsibility for sector policies and strategies, and provision of infrastructure services \nat the national level. However, the differing roles and responsibilities among disparate levels of \ngovernment and agencies for the development and management of infrastructure are often not \nclearly demarcated or adequately coordinated, and regulations are not consistent. Inadequate \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 27 March 2013.  \n ", "2  \nlocal  government  capacity  to  prepare  and  implement  projects  has  resulted  in  an  overall \nslowdown in infrastructure development.  \n \n5.  All  levels  of government face  capacity  constraints  in  planning,  implementation,  and \noperation and maintenance of infrastructure. Asset management planning and programs are \neither absent or not well developed, leading to reactive rather than preventative maintenance. \nThe government also has limited capacity to procure consultants and tender services consistent \nwith development partners\u2019 guidelines and Indonesia\u2019s procedures, which in turn lead to delays \nand  bottlenecks.  Project  readiness  and  safeguards  in  particular  are  often  not  advanced \nadequately  to  support  effective  and  timely  implementation.  Lack  of  coordination  among \nministries leads to long delays in obtaining forestry permits and environmental clearances. \nMoreover, the slow process of land acquisition continues to result in long project implementation \ndelays.  \n \n6.  Tariff policies in many sectors do not allow for full cost recovery, and infrastructure \nproviders rely on subsidies through public service obligations; in addition to having opportunity \ncosts,  these  subsidies  introduce  substantial  uncertainty  into  medium-  and  long-range \ninvestment planning. For example, the tariffs that can be levied by government-owned water \nutilities are set below cost recovery by local governments; they are even insufficient to support \noperation and maintenance expenses. Funds for system rehabilitation and expansion have not \nbeen provided to keep up with growing demand and rapid urbanization. Similarly, while the \ninvestment needs in the electricity sector are in the range of $8 billion\u2013$10 billion per year, the \nstate electricity company, Perusahaan Listrik Negara, which is heavily subsidized through a \npublic service obligation, only has access to a limited infrastructure budget of about $2 billion a \nyear, contributing to underinvestment in the sector. \n \n7.  Despite progress in promoting public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) in infrastructure during \n1990\u20131997, projects were generally chosen on a non-competitive basis and the provision of \ngovernment support was ad hoc. In 2005, the government announced a newly designed PPP \nprogram, and some progress has been made in improving the policy, legal and regulatory, \nfinancing,  and risk management frameworks for  PPP.  However,  delivering  bankable  PPPs \nremains challenging, in particular because the institutional framework and capacity for project \npreparation  and  transactions  are  inadequate.  In  addition,  enhanced  coordination  among \ngovernment agencies is needed to improve the private sector enabling environment, streamline \nland acquisition, and reduce regulatory inconsistency among different levels of government and \nother agencies. \n \n8.  Developing infrastructure and improving the overall enabling environment to enhance \nconnectivity  within  and  among  Indonesia\u2019s  islands  are  key  development  priorities  of  the \ngovernment.2 Recognizing the crucial link between infrastructure development and sustained, \ninclusive  growth,  the  National  Medium-Term  Development  Plan,  2010\u20132014  highlights \nincreased infrastructure development as a key priority.3 The government\u2019s emerging policy on \ndevelopment  cooperation  underscores  that  foreign  borrowing  for  projects  will  entail  (i) \ninvestments  in  energy,  infrastructure,  and  urban  development  including  through  PPPs;  (ii) \ntransfer of technology and knowledge; and (iii) capacity development. The ADB Indonesia \ncountry  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132014  also  accords  priority  to  these  development \n                                                \n2  Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs. 2011.

Jakarta) is the second phase of implementation of the \nNational Long\u2010Term Development Plan 2005\u20132025. \n ", "  3\nimperatives.4 The  TAC  aims  to  develop  a  partnership  for  deeper  collaboration  among  the \nGovernment of Indonesia, ADB, and the Government of Australia with a view to supporting \nshared infrastructure development objectives in Indonesia. \n \n9.  A review of ADB\u2019s prior operations and other evaluation studies in the infrastructure \nsectors in Indonesia point to several persistent challenges: (i) the poor capacity of implementing \nagencies to design, procure and implement projects; (ii) long delays in land acquisition and \npermit processing; (iii) an inadequate focus on environmental and social safeguards; and (iv) \ninadequate private sector participation. The TAC will address these challenges through an \nintegrated, comprehensive approach that focuses on projects and their enabling environment, \nand complements project preparatory work through capacity strengthening of implementing \nagencies, bolstering of safeguards-related measures, and relevant analytical work.  \n \n10.  The TAC will facilitate programmatic support for ADB\u2019s infrastructure portfolio across \nenergy, transport, WSS, and urban services sectors. ADB will address policy and regulatory \nreform,  capacity  development,  preparation  of  strategic  and  catalytic  investments,  and \ndevelopment of knowledge products and services. The TAC supports several key priorities of \nADB\u2019s  Indonesia  country  partnership  strategy:  development  partnerships,  private  sector \ndevelopment including PPPs, knowledge management, governance and capacity development, \nand, where applicable, gender equity and regional cooperation. It will support the government\u2019s \nimplementation of selected elements of its reform and development agenda through focused \npolicy dialogue, targeted capacity development, and preparation of innovative and scalable \nproject  interventions.  In  coordination  with  the  National  Development  Planning  Agency \n(BAPPENAS), the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), key government \nsector agencies and state-owned enterprises, and other development partners, the TAC will \nincrease coordination and synergy across ADB\u2019s sovereign and nonsovereign infrastructure \nportfolios. Supplementary Appendix A summarizes the development partner activities that will \nbe complemented by the TAC.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The expected impact will be increased infrastructure investments in the energy, transport, \nWSS, and urban services sectors to sustain economic growth and poverty reduction. The TAC \noutcome will be improved project readiness and development of a set of bankable projects in \nthe energy, transport, WSS, and urban services sectors.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TAC will provide a holistic approach to addressing implementation challenges in \nIndonesia\u2019s infrastructure sector by supporting capacity strengthening of implementing agencies, \nbolstering  of  safeguards-related  measures  and  relevant  analytical  work  development,  and \npromoting enabling conditions that will assist in the rapid implementation of investment projects. \nThese activities will be undertaken in conjunction with project preparatory work.  \n \n13.  The TAC will comprise several components to be implemented during 2013\u20132017. It will \nenable ADB, AusAID, and Indonesia to adopt a long-term perspective and develop a sustained \npartnership, and provide flexibility in the design and implementation of the component projects. \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: Indonesia, 2012\u20132014. Manila. \n ", "4  \nThe cluster approach will (i) provide a multi-sector, coordinated platform to address common \nissues across sectors; (ii) strengthen the government\u2019s capacity to implement projects and \nundertake policy and sector reforms involving local and national-level stakeholders from the \npublic and private sectors; and (iii) provide flexibility in programming the components to most \neffectively respond to the government\u2019s evolving infrastructure needs during 2013\u20132017.  \n \n14.  ADB\u2019s  current  policy  on  technical  assistance  (TA)  operations  primarily  restricts  the \ncluster approach to capacity development and policy and advisory-type activities.5 The ADB \nBoard  will  be  requested  to  approve  a  variation  to  the  existing  policy  to  include  project \npreparation TA in the proposed TAC on an exceptional basis, as this would increase the \nefficiency and effectiveness of ADB\u2019s infrastructure operations in Indonesia, by ensuring a more \ncoordinated approach  to  addressing  cross-sectoral  themes.6 The  requirements for financial \nmanagement assessment of project enterprises and of safeguards compliance applicable to \nproject preparation TA will be maintained, including enhanced management scrutiny of the \ncomponent TA projects.  \n \n15.  The  TAC  will  deliver  four  outputs:  (i)  policy  and  advisory  services,  (ii)  capacity \ndevelopment  of  relevant  government  agencies,  (iii)  preparation  of  bankable  infrastructure \nprojects, and (iv) knowledge management and dissemination. Key activities under the TAC will \ninclude (i) reviews, assessments, and recommendations for policies and regulations; (ii) rapid \nresponse  to  the  government\u2019s  requests  for  assessments  of  emerging  policy  issues;  (iii) \nformulation of strategies, plans and roadmaps; and (iv) organizational and institutional reforms. \nThe main project preparation-related activities will comprise pre-feasibility and feasibility studies, \nincluding financial management and economic soundness; environmental and social safeguards \nand poverty assessments; and procurement and implementation plans for selected projects.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA cluster is estimated to cost $23,000,000, of which $20,000,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by the Government of Australia and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide counterpart contributions in the form of staff, domestic transportation, office space, \noffice supplies, access to data and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing \nplan and the estimated funding requirement from the TAC for each component TA are in \nAppendix 2. The government has been informed that approval of the TAC does not commit ADB \nto finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  BAPPENAS will be the executing agency and responsible for overall management and \ncoordination of the TAC. Relevant line ministries or agencies will be the executing agencies for \nthe  respective  component  TA  projects.  The  implementation  arrangements  are  outlined  in \nSupplementary Appendix B. The procedures for processing and execution of the component TA \nprojects are summarized in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n18.  A steering committee will be established to provide overall guidance on programming \nand  critical  project-related  activities  of  the  TAC.  The  deputy  minister  for  infrastructure  of \nBAPPENAS and the country director of the Indonesia Resident Mission will serve as co-chairs \n                                                \n5  ADB. 1997.

The steering committee will include relevant sector directors of: (i) \nADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Department and (ii) government ministries and agencies involved in \ninfrastructure  development.  A  technical  advisory  group  comprising  representatives  of  the \ngovernment ministries or agencies and ADB sector division project specialists will assist the \nsteering committee in performing its tasks by reviewing TA proposals and other documents.  \n \n19.  TAC  implementation  will  be  anchored  in the Indonesia  Resident  Mission  under  the \nsupervision  of  the  country  director  supported  by  a  project  officer,  who  will  work  in  close \ncollaboration with the ADB sector divisions managing the component TA projects for energy, \ntransport, WSS, and urban services. The resident mission will be supported by an infrastructure \nmanagement unit comprised of consultants. The TAC will be implemented over 4 years (July \n2013 to June 2017), with a completion report prepared for the entire TAC.  \n \n20.  Consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The TAC will require a mix of international \nand national consultants with various expertise and skills, as well as a mix of recruitment \napproaches  involving  both  individuals  and  firms.  Firms  and  individuals  will  be  contracted \nthrough a mix of quality-based selection, single source selection, and quality-and cost-based \nselection using full and simplified technical proposals as may be most appropriate for the \ncircumstances of each assignment. Lump sum contracts for specific outputs may also be used.  \n \n21.  The  implementation  of  TA  activities  will  require  931  person-months  of  consulting \nservices, comprising 469 person-months of international and 462 person-months of national \nconsultant services, and broken down as follows: (i) component projects: 805 person-months \n(international, 375 person-months; national  430 person-months); (ii) infrastructure management \nunit: 86 person-months (international, 74 person-months; national 12 person-months); and (iii) \nimmediate needs of the executing and implementing agencies for specific advisory services: 20 \nperson-months each of international and national consultant services. The types of expertise \nrequired and the outline terms of reference for the infrastructure management unit are included \nin Appendix 3. Summaries of the component TA projects are in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n22.  Procurement under the TAC and component projects will be in accordance with the ADB \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Equipment for the component \nprojects  will  be  procured  by the TA  consultants  and turned  over  to  the government  upon \ncompletion of each TA project. All disbursements under the TAC will be in accordance with the \nADB Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nAusAID will transfer the funds to ADB in annual tranches. ADB will  manage the funds in \naccordance with its procedures, and will provide six-monthly reports on the implementation of \nthe TAC and its components, including unaudited financial statements of commitments and \nutilization.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION  \n  \n23.  The President recommends that the Board approve (i) ADB administering the technical \nassistance cluster not exceeding the equivalent of $20,000,000 to the Government of Indonesia \nto be financed on a grant basis by the Government of Australia for the Sustainable Infrastructure \nAssistance Program, and (ii) a variation of the existing policy to include project preparatory \ntechnical assistance components, on exceptional basis, as proposed in paragraph 14 of this \nreport.  \n ", " \n6  Appendix 1\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and Risks \n  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms \nImpact      Assumption \nInfrastructure  Increase in proportion of  Central Bureau of Statistics  Continued government \ninvestments in the  population with sustainable  data  commitment to \nenergy, transport, and  access to an improved water  Annual reporting from  macroeconomic and \nWSS and urban  source from 50% in 2011 to  BAPPENAS, MOF, and  sector reforms \nservices sectors  over 70% by 2022.   relevant line ministries  Risk \nincreased  \nIncrease in proportion of  ADB and development  Unforeseen deterioration \npopulation with sustainable  partner economic  of the global economic \naccess to basic sanitation  evaluation and reporting   environment and/or natural \nfrom 51% in 2009 to over  BAPPENAS report on  disasters may reduce \n70% by 2022.
