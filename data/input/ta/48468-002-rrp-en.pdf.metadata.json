THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Guizhou  Rocky  Desertification  Area  Water \nManagement Project.  \n \n2.  The  project  will  help  the  Guizhou  Provincial  Government  (GPG)  reduce  rocky \ndesertification areas and improve the livelihoods of people living in rocky desertification areas by \nconserving  water  resources;  restoring  environment,  ecology,  and  land  productivity;  and \nincreasing resilience to climate change. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Rocky desertification is characterized by vegetation degradation, soil erosion, and bedrock \nexposure. It occurs in various countries and regions, including the Mediterranean and Dinaric \nkarst regions of the Balkan Peninsula as well as the southwest region of the PRC on a large \nscale.1 In the PRC, rocky desertification is one of the most serious land degradation problems in \nkarst areas spreading in the southwest, which has a population of 220 million and overlaps the \nYangtze River Economic Belt. Karst area is susceptible to rocky desertification because of the \nlow soil formation rate and high permeability of limestone. Where arable flat land and water are \nlimited, originally vegetated karst areas are cultivated by removing vegetation and planting rain-\nfed crops which are less effective for soil conservation. Soil erosion control is not conducted in \nmost  cultivation  areas.  Such  repeated  unsustainable  cultivation  has  increased  the  rocky \ndesertification areas. Climate change is expected to increase temperatures and the frequency \nand  intensity  of  extreme  climatic  events,  including  storms.  This  could  exacerbate  rocky \ndesertification by exposing the soil surface to warming and evaporation, and by causing physical \ndamage such as erosion. Rocky desertification reduces vegetation, soil, land productivity, and \narable lands; increases natural disasters such as landslides and debris flows; and deteriorates \necology, increasing vulnerability to climate change and deteriorating people\u2019s livelihoods.  \n \n4.  Guizhou is in the southwest PRC and has a population of 35 million, of which 36.1% is \nethnic minority. Agriculture, forestry, and fishery account for 16.3% of Guizhou\u2019s gross domestic \nproduct (GDP)2\u2014much higher than the PRC average of 9.2%. Crop production is the most \nimportant agricultural activity (10.4% of Guizhou\u2019s GDP and 64.0% of its agricultural, forestry, and \nfishery products). Guizhou\u2019s total area is 176,167 square kilometers (km2), of which 92.5% is \nmountain or hilly area. It has 112,240 km2 of karst areas (63.7% of its total area). Guizhou is in \nthe Yangtze River Economic Belt and is an important province to develop the southwest and far \nwest regions. It has the biggest rocky desertification area in the PRC, at 30,237 km2 (17.2% of its \ntotal area and 25.2% of the total rocky desertification area in the PRC).3  \n \n5.  Water is necessary to change unsustainable land use and restore vegetation in rocky \ndesertification areas. In the southwest PRC, including Guizhou, rainfall concentrates during the \n                                                \n1  Karst topography is a landscape formed from the dissolution of soluble rocks such as limestone. \n2  Guizhou\u2019s GDP is CNY1,050.3 billion. The biggest contributor to Guizhou\u2019s GDP is industry, but its contribution rate \nof 31.6% is lower than the PRC average of 34.3%. \n3  In Anlong and Nayong counties where the project will be implemented, the ratio of rocky desertification areas is \n32.4% in Anlong and 25.4% in Nayong, which are much higher than the provincial ratio of 17.2%. \n ", "2 \nrainy season and becomes floodwater that cannot be used.4 Porous limestone formations cannot \ncapture and store much rainfall. Much of the water drains into rivers quickly through numerous \nshort creeks and streams that run deep in valleys, or through deep aquifers (groundwater rivers) \nin limestone layers.5 Although annual precipitation in Guizhou (1,273 millimeters) is much higher \nthan the PRC average (622 millimeters), the amount of annual water supply per person (272 cubic \nmeters [m3]/person) is about 60% of the PRC average (447 m3/person). To capture sufficient \nwater and distribute it to users in karst areas, and to change unsustainable land use and restore \nvegetation in rocky desertification areas, water storage facilities are essential.6 \n \n6.  Guizhou has the lowest GDP in the PRC at CNY26,444, which is 56.7% of the PRC \naverage. The rural poverty ratio in Guizhou (18.0%) is much higher than the national rate (7.2%).7 \nThe poor population in rocky desertification areas accounts for 50.2% of Guizhou\u2019s total poor \npopulation. Rocky desertification is a main cause of the deterioration of livelihoods in Guizhou. \n \n7.  Governments\u2019 past activities. The central government issued the Planning Framework \nfor  Integrated  Rocky  Desertification  Management  in  Karst  Areas  in  2008.8 Based  on  this \nframework,  different  levels  of  government  prepared  more  detailed  plans  to  address  rocky \ndesertification, including the Guizhou Provincial Master Plan for Water Resources Development, \nEcological Improvement, and Rocky Desertification Management.9 Activities under this master \nplan include the construction and rehabilitation of water storage and transfer facilities; integrated \ncontrol of slope land farming; improvement of irrigation area and vegetation; and farmland \ndevelopment, to increase water supply, irrigation area,  and forestry, and control the rocky \ndesertification area. The main challenges that have emerged through past rocky desertification \nmanagement are: (i) since unsustainable land use by local people is the main cause of rocky \ndesertification, local people need to be involved in rocky desertification management to reduce \nthe driving force for rocky desertification and ensure the sustainability of rocky desertification \nmanagement; (ii) monitoring of rocky desertification should be conducted adequately, following \nmethods  and  frequency  set  in  advance,  to  provide  an  accurate  baseline  and  assess  the \neffectiveness of rocky desertification management; and (iii) local governments\u2019 finances and \ncapacities for rocky desertification management need to be strengthened. \n \n8.  Strategic fit. The project will protect the ecological environment, improve water security, \nincrease resilience to climate change, and improve people\u2019s livelihoods. It is consistent with (i) the \n                                                \n4  Uneven seasonal rainfall in Anlong and Nayong is more remarkable than in the whole province. In 2014, annual \nprecipitation concentrated during May\u2013September was 84.0% in Anlong and 74.0% in Nayong. \n5  ADB\u2019s flagship publication (ADB. 2012. Drying Up\u2014What to Do about Droughts in the People\u2019s Republic of China:  \nWith a Case Study from Guiyang Municipality, Guizhou Province. Manila) also indicated that only 33% of rainfall and \nrunoff in Guiyang (capital city of Guizhou) can be captured and kept in rivers because of its mountain terrain, karst \ndeposits, high evaporation from rocky desertification, and rapid drainage through underground channels.  \n6  The amounts of annual water supply per person from water storage facilities in Anlong (86 m3/person) and Nayong \n(52 m3/person) are much smaller than the amount in the province as a whole (159 m3/person). This is because \nAnlong and Nayong have insufficient water storage facilities (water storage capacities per person are 42 m3/person \nin Anlong and 39 m3/person in Nayong against 462 m3/person in the whole province). Some 70%\u201380% of water \nsupply in Anlong and Nayong relies on unstable resources such as rainfall, stream, and groundwater. \n7  Anlong and Nayong are national poverty counties located in a national pilot area for poverty reduction. The poverty \nratio in the project areas is 20.7% in Anlong and 20.6% in Nayong.  \n8  State Council of the PRC. 2008.

Lessons. Lessons from international institutes such as the United Nations Convention to \nCombat Desertification14 and ADB\u2019s previous projects have been incorporated in the project \ndesign, including (i) the necessity of economic incentives for land users, for sustainable land \nmanagement; (ii) the effectiveness of market-based approaches to scale up sustainable land \nmanagement,  such  as  payment  for  ecosystem  services  based  on  cost\u2013benefit  analysis; \n(iii) technologies to avoid water leakage from reservoirs in karst areas; (iv) the effectiveness of \nrevegetation with community participation; (v) the need for a neutral third party with knowledge of \neco-compensation to coordinate between affected people and beneficiaries to establish an eco-\ncompensation mechanism;15 and (vi) effective measures to disseminate demonstrated initiatives \n(e.g., workshops, publications, use of website, and cooperation with academic societies).  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The project is aligned with the following impact: livelihoods of people living in rocky \ndesertification areas improved (footnote 9). The project will have the following outcome: rocky \ndesertification area reduced.16 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n11.  Output 1: Water resources conserved. This output will include (i) construction of two \nreservoirs in Anlong (Pingqiao reservoir) and Nayong (Pingshan reservoir) counties in Guizhou \n(with maximum water storage capacities of 78.98 million m3 in Anlong and 14.69 million m3 in \nNayong) and related water transfer facilities (canals, pipes, a pump station, a regulation pond, \nand terminal tanks);17 and (ii) establishment of water user associations for the reservoirs.18 \nInnovative technologies will be used to prevent water leakage and slope collapse of the reservoirs \nand to increase the efficiency of water transfer. The design maximum flood occurrence is 1 in \n                                                \n10  Government of the PRC. 2016. Thirteenth Five-Year Plan on National Economic and Social Development.

People affected by such pollution reduction measures can be \nadequately compensated by establishing an eco-compensation mechanism.  \n16  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n17  Includes the construction of a 74.5-meter high rock-fill dam in Anlong and a 94.0-meter high concrete face rock-fill \ndam in Nayong. \n18 Water user associations contribute to efficient water use by operating irrigation facilities, allocating water to members, \nand providing instructions on water saving and advanced farming to members.  \n \n ", "4 \n2,000 years for the dam and spillway in Anlong and 1 in 1,000 years in Nayong.19 The two \nreservoirs will provide water for irrigation (46,980,000 m3/year, 4,263 m3/hectare [ha]/year) and \ndomestic use (44,710,000 m3/year, 493 m3/household/year).   \n \n12.  Output 2: Environment, ecology, and land productivity restored. This output will \ninclude (i) revegetation; (ii) promotion of sustainable farming; and (iii) monitoring, policy reform, \ncapacity development, and knowledge dissemination. \n \n13.  Revegetation will reduce existing and potential rocky desertification by planting native \ntrees (including fruit trees) effective for ecological restoration, soil conservation, and climate \nresilience. Local people with land use rights on rocky desertification area where no farming is \nbeing conducted will conduct revegetation in the area based on agreements with the Guizhou \nWater Resources Investment Company Limited (GWIC) using materials, trees, and equipment \nprovided by the GWIC.20 The planted trees and income from the trees will belong to the local \npeople, which will increase their motivation for revegetation. Consultants will train local people, \nsupervise revegetation activities, and conduct monitoring.  \n \n14.  To change unsustainable farming (i.e., cultivation of low-value rain-fed crops without soil \ncontrol)\u2014which is the main cause of rocky desertification\u2014to sustainable farming, the project will \nprovide local farmers with incentives to adopt sustainable farming. Sustainable farming pilot \nprojects  will  include  the  construction  of  irrigation  facilities,  demonstration  of  water-saving \ntechnologies, soil erosion control, and cultivation of high-value crops. Local farmers who have \nland use rights on the pilot project areas will conduct sustainable farming based on agreements \nwith the county government. The county government will construct irrigation facilities and soil \nerosion control structures and purchase necessary materials, equipment, and seedlings. Income \nfrom sustainable farming will belong to the local farmers. Consultants will train the local farmers, \nsupervise the pilot projects, conduct monitoring, and promote sustainable farming (e.g., through \nonsite workshops, market surveys, and guidance to local farmers on sustainable farming). \n \n15.  Other activities will include (i) monitoring of rocky desertification and the impact of climate \nchange, (ii) establishment of eco-compensation mechanisms for the two reservoirs constructed \nunder the project (footnote 15), (iii) protection of important revegetated areas; (iv) improvement \nof governments\u2019 existing policies and regulations, (v) improvement of existing microfinancing \nsystems to promote sustainable farming, and (vi) dissemination of the project\u2019s initiatives.  \n \n16.  Value added by ADB assistance. ADB will add value by introducing new technologies \nand good practices in project design and implementation, including community involvement. \nSpecifically, the project will (i) introduce water-saving technologies; (ii) involve and benefit local \npeople,  especially  women;  (iii)  introduce  climate  change  adaptation  measures;  and  (iv) \ndisseminate project initiatives. Innovative technologies to prevent water leakage and increase \nwater transfer efficiency will be used for the reservoirs and water transfer facilities, and a demand-\nbased remote water allocation system will be demonstrated in the sustainable farming pilot \nprojects. Revegetation and sustainable farming pilot projects will be conducted, involving local \npeople, to reduce unsustainable land use and ensure the sustainability of rocky desertification \nmanagement activities. Revegetation, promotion of sustainable farming, and monitoring of rocky \ndesertification areas and climate change impact will improve climate resilience; and the project \n                                                \n19  The design maximum flood occurrence is the flood level under which the reservoir can withhold without causing \ndamage to the main structures. \n20  An implementing agency that is a 100% GPG-owned company established to invest and administer projects included \nin the Guizhou Provincial Master Plan for Water Resources Development, Ecological Improvement, and Rocky \nDesertification Management (footnote 9). \n ", "5 \ndesign has considered anticipated climate change impacts (adequate reservoir and spillway \ncapacities,  frost-resistant  material,  and  selection  of  drought-resistant  tree  species  for \nrevegetation). Consulting services will help disseminate project initiatives. \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n17.  The project is estimated to cost $338.81 million (Table 1).

The technical feasibility \nis adequate including the project\u2019s compatibility with local conditions and local capacity for \noperation and maintenance (O&M). With regard to the two reservoirs, (i) the sites are geologically \nstable and have low seismic vulnerability, (ii) the designs meet PRC standards for structural \nintegrity, (iii) both reservoirs were designed for maximum safety (for the design maximum flood \noccurrence of 1 in 2,000 years for the dam and spillway in Anlong and 1 in 1,000 years for those \nin Nayong), (iv) a maintenance program and safety monitoring system will be implemented, and \n(v) emergency response plans were prepared for the construction phase and will be prepared for \nthe operation phase by the completion of the reservoirs. \n  \nB.  Economic and Financial \n  \n23.  The economic internal rate of return was estimated by comparing with- and without-project \nscenarios for each subproject and the project as a whole. The project\u2019s economic costs reflect \n(i) the capital cost for construction, including environmental monitoring and land acquisition and \nresettlement costs,  and  physical  contingencies;  and  (ii)  annual O&M  costs.  The quantified \neconomic benefits of the project were derived mainly from projected increases in agricultural \nproduction and the value of additional water supply. The overall economic internal rate of return \nwas estimated at 9.88% and the net present value is CNY193.6 million, indicating the economic \nviability of the project. The full economic benefits of the project are expected to be substantially \nhigher, as some significant effects, such as ecological benefits, are not easily quantifiable.   \n \n24.  The project is not intended to be full cost-recovery, so the overall financial viability remains \ncontingent on fiscal resources of the GPG, ACG, and NCG for continuous support for counterpart \nfunding and debt servicing. It is anticipated that fiscal resources of the GPG, ACG, and NCG will \ncontinue to grow in line with economic development, providing additional resource mobility to \nfinance the project. Revenue generated from the project will be sufficient to cover O&M costs.   \n \nC.  Governance \n \n25.  The financial management risk  before  considering mitigation  measures  is  moderate \nmainly because of a moderate inherent risk, moderate control risk, and comparatively high level \nof financial management capacities. Measures to mitigate the identified financial management \nrisks are in the financial management assessment.22   \n \n26.  The procurement risk assessment confirmed that the implementing agencies (GWIC, \nACG, and NCG), which will conduct procurement through a procurement agency and with the \nassistance of ADB and the consultants, will have adequate procurement capacity to facilitate full \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time).  \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and GPG. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n28.  The project has been categorized geographic targeting (TI-G) since the project area \ncomprises national level poverty counties and significant portions of the project beneficiaries are \n                                                \n22 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nthe poor or vulnerable; and it will contribute to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 through \nsustainable management of water resources, SDG 13 through climate adaptation measures, and \nSDG 15 through halting or reversing land degradation.23 Poverty, social, and gender analyses \nwere undertaken; and adequate measures have been included in the project design to ensure \nthat local people, including the poor, women, and ethnic minorities, benefit from the project. The \nproject  will  provide  local  people  with  significant  poverty  reduction  and  socioeconomic \ndevelopment benefits. A total of 718,950 local people will benefit directly from improved irrigation, \nwater supply, fruit tree plantation, and sustainable farming. In addition, the project will create local \njobs during construction and O&M. Consultations have been undertaken with local people during \nproject preparation, and will be continued during project implementation. \n \n29.  The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. It will provide women with \nsignificant benefits. Availability of water will save women\u2019s time for collecting water and provide \nthem with opportunities to conduct profitable economic activities. A gender action plan, prepared \nto address gender issues identified during the gender analysis, comprises specific measures for \nwomen, including (i) the involvement of women in the design and implementation of project \nactivities; (ii) targeted employment of women during construction and O&M; (iii) training and \ncapacity building for women; and (iv) monitoring of the gender action plan, including the collection \nof sex-disaggregated data. The GPG, ACG, and NCG will implement and monitor the gender \naction plan and report the progress to ADB. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n30.  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (SPS,  2009),  the  project\u2019s \nsafeguard categories are as follows.24 \n \n31.  Environment (category A). The project is classified category A for environment because \nof the potential environmental impacts from the construction of the two reservoirs and water \ntransfer facilities (para. 32). An environmental impact assessment, including an environmental \nmanagement  plan  (EMP),  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  SPS.  The  EMP  includes \nmitigation  and  monitoring  requirements  and  institutional  responsibilities  to  ensure  proper \nenvironmental management throughout construction and O&M. The GPG, ACG, and NCG, \nthrough the PMO and project implementation units, will be responsible for the implementation of \nthe EMP and compliance with national laws and regulations, including inspection, monitoring, \nreporting, and corrective actions or measures. The environmental impact assessment concludes \nthat effective EMP implementation, together with training, will result in residual impacts within the \nlimits of the PRC standards defined in the EMP. The environmental impact assessment, including \nthe EMP, was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 19 December 2016.25 \n \n32.  The project is expected to achieve environmental benefits, including a reduction of rocky \ndesertification areas; protection of the headwaters of the two reservoirs; increased water supply \nfor irrigation and domestic use, especially in dry seasons; improved ecology in the revegetation \nsites; and improved farming practices in rocky desertification areas. Environmental impacts relate \nto the construction and operation of the two reservoirs, including inundation of lands.

Consultations involved key stakeholders, including affected people and agencies of \nthe  ACG  and  NCG.  Mitigation  measures  developed  based  on  these  assessments  and \nconsultations include sedimentation control, revegetation, headwater protection, ecological flow \nallocations, and solid waste management. The impact downstream by altered flows is low, as the \nproject is designed to strengthen water supply, especially in dry seasons. \n \n33.  Involuntary resettlement (category A). The reservoirs and water transfer facilities will \ncause significant resettlement impacts. A total of 2,261 households with 7,980 persons will be \naffected by permanent land acquisition, out of which 3,190 persons in 678 households will be \nphysically relocated and resettled. A total of 534.3 ha of land will be affected permanently, \nincluding 13.0 ha of state land and 521.3 ha of collective land; 115.8 ha of collective land will be \noccupied temporarily; and 113,285.6 square meters of residential structures will be demolished. \nResettlement plans have been prepared for Anlong and Nayong following the SPS and PRC laws \nand regulations, and were disclosed on the ADB website (footnote 25). The resettlement plans \ninclude adequate measures to ensure that displaced persons are successfully compensated, \nresettled, and rehabilitated. Extensive consultations were undertaken with affected people during \nthe preparation of the resettlement plans, and they will be further consulted during implementation. \nLocal governments have regular grievance mechanisms, and the project-specific grievance \nredress mechanism will be in place before construction starts. The information on the grievance \nredress mechanism has been disclosed to affected persons through the disclosure of safeguard \nplans. Costs for land acquisition and resettlement are included in the project cost. The GPG, ACG, \nand NCG will fully finance the costs for implementation of the resettlement plans. The PMO will \nengage an external monitoring and evaluation agency and submit semiannual reports to ADB.   \n \n34.  Indigenous peoples or ethnic minorities (category B). Ethnic minorities constitute 52% \nof the direct beneficiaries of the project. The EMP and resettlement plans address the adverse \nimpacts of civil works, land acquisition, and resettlement. Other impacts will be mostly positive for \nethnic minorities and other populations. Ethnic minority and social development plans were \nprepared in consultation with local stakeholders, including ethnic minorities, in accordance with \nthe  SPS;  and  have  been  disclosed  to  affected  persons  as  well  as  on  the  ADB  website \n(footnote 25).  These plans include measures to ensure that ethnic minorities participate in and \nbenefit from project activities, and adverse impacts on them are avoided or mitigated.   \n \n35.  The GPG has experience in ADB projects, but ACG and NCG have no experience in ADB \nprojects and their staff\u2019s capacity for safeguards is low. For the GPG, ACG, and NCG to implement \nand monitor the EMP, resettlement plans, and ethnic minority and social development plans, \ncapacity development programs for safeguards were integrated in the project design, and each \nof the PMO and two project implementation units include full-time environment, and resettlement \nand social officers. ADB will finance the costs of (i) project management support consultants, \nincluding adequate specialists for safeguards; and (ii) an external resettlement monitoring and \nevaluation. The PMO will implement a grievance redress mechanism and have final responsibility \nfor handling any disputes. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n36.

ASSURANCES \n37.  The government and GPG have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n38.  The government and GPG have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \nwhich are set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n39.
