The  Government  of  Mongolia,  during  the  country  programming  mission  held  in \nUlaanbaatar in March 2018, requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide a lending \nsupport to prepare the Strengthening Integrated Early Warning System Mongolia Project. The \nensuing loan and the proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) is included in ADB\u2019s country \noperations business plan for Mongolia, 2020\u20132021.1 \n \n2.  The  government  plans  to  increase  investments  in  disaster  risk  reduction,  and \npreparedness measures. This should include the establishment of a multi-hazard particularly the \nselected hazards including epidemics and pandemics early warning system (EWS), which can \nprovide information on hazards that enables advance action to reduce the associated risks. They \nare an important element of disaster risk management (DRM) as early action can reduce the loss \nof human life and other assets. To be effective and sustainable they must involve communities \nwith emphasis on increased awareness and capacity of communities to be able to respond to \nwarnings and have in place preparedness plans. \n \n3.  The proposed project will support the development of a comprehensive approach to EWS \nby putting in place the five key elements of EWS in a cycle (i) risk knowledge with appropriate \nassessment; (ii) detection and surveillance networks,  monitoring and analysis; (iii) forecasting \nand  warning;  (iv)  dissemination  and  communication;  and  (v)  preparedness  and  response \ncapacity. These elements are fundamental needs for early warning system for all kind of hazards \nincluding epidemics and pandemics. Lack of or inadequate interventions or poor performance of \nany of these elements in the cycle may lead to the failure of the entire EWS. To achieve an \noutcome of effective EWS, the system should (i) involve the people and communities at risk from \na range of hazards; (ii) link EWS to contingency plans, adequately supported by physical and \nsocial infrastructure; (iii) utilize cutting edge technologies to enhance efficiency; (iv) promote \ninclusiveness; and (v) engage all stakeholders at different levels. At present, integrated EWS is \nnot available in Mongolia, and its need is becoming even more apparent during recent national \nemergencies. In Mongolia, early warning information is available only for selected hazards such \nas earthquakes in and around Ulaanbaatar. Likewise, meteorological forecast alone is often \nregarded as warning information. Investment in comprehensive EWS for critical hazards through \nproper assessment is therefore urgently needed in Mongolia.  \n \n4.  The proposed project will also result in significant capacity building and awareness raising \nabout DRM and the role of disaster risk reduction strategies. The proposed loan will build on \nexisting capacity and activities within the National Emergency and Management Agency (NEMA) \nas well as coordinate with stakeholders in the sector. Specifically, it will scale up activities from \nthe knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) MON (52021): Strengthening Capacity on \nDisaster Risk Assessment, Reduction and Transfer Instruments in Mongolia. The disaster risk \nreduction approaches developed under this TA for (i) disaster risk assessments to improve the \nidentification of hazards, assess risk exposure and vulnerability, and estimate the severity of \npotential damage and losses; and (ii) strengthened government and community planning, with \nemphasis on risk reduction and prevention will be upscaled through this proposed loan project.  \n \n5.  The ensuing project is estimated to cost $30.3 million. ADB is requested to finance $30.0 \nmillion ($20.0 million from regular loan and $10.0 million from concessional loan) largely for \n \n1  ADB. 2019.

The central and local governments will provide \nin-kind contribution equivalent to $0.3 million. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n6.  The executing agency, the NEMA has limited experience with ADB requirements for loan \npreparation. The transaction TA will help the government prepare a project design that complies \nwith ADB requirements and international best practice.2 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n7.

Cost and Financing \n \n8.

The government was informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB \nto finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.  ADB will administer the TA. The Emergency Management Department of NEMA will \nprovide guidance during project preparation. The project implementation unit at NEMA will also \noversee project preparation and implement the project in close coordination with the (i) Ministry \nof Environment and Tourism on weather-related and fire hazards; (ii) Ministry of Health on \nepidemics and pandemics; (iii) and other relevant agencies at different levels.
