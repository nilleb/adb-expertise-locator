INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will continue to support capacity \nbuilding of the financial supervisors and regulators across Asia and the Pacific under the Asia-\nPacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Financial Regulators Training Initiative (FRTI).1 The TA \nprovides developing member countries (DMCs) with training programs so that they can improve \nregulation and supervision of financial institutions and markets, and respond effectively to new \ndevelopments and emerging issues in the finance sector, thereby helping to prevent financial \ncrises.  \n \n2.  The TA is included in the management-approved annual work program of the Financial \nCooperation and Integration Team under the Economic Research and Regional Cooperation \nDepartment. Further, it aligns with Strategy 20202 and Strategy 2020 Midterm Review3 of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) as it aims to strengthen the capacity of regional financial \nregulators and promote cooperation and collaboration among financial supervisory authorities.4 \nStrategy 2020 identified finance sector development as one of the five focal areas of ADB\u2019s \noperations, and the midterm review set out regional cooperation and integration for financial \nstability as one of ADB\u2019s strategic priorities. The TA is also consistent with the Financial Sector \nOperation Plan5 and its review6 as it will provide capacity building programs to address those \nissues associated with emerging risks from innovative financial products. The TA serves as a \nplatform for regional financial supervisors to discuss regional financial issues and to learn from \npeer  regulators,  and  thereby  promotes  finance  sector  development,  stability,  and  regional \ncooperation.  \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The APEC finance ministers endorsed the establishment of the APEC FRTI in May 1998 \nin response to the Asian financial crisis that broke out in 1997, based on the recognition of the \nimportance of well-trained financial supervisors on financial stability. Since the APEC FRTI\u2019s \ninception, ADB has provided secretariat and funding support for the implementation of the \ninitiative primarily out of the Technical Assistance Special Fund and Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration Fund. Many supervisory authorities, particularly those of the United States, acted as \nresource persons with no fee in the spirit of mutual help. Participating financial supervisors have \nshouldered all their travel-related costs, while host countries have provided the venues for the \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 1997.

Review of 2011 Financial Sector Operational Plan. Manila. \n ", "2   \n \ntraining courses. With the strong ownership of APEC member countries, ADB has been able to \ncost-effectively support the initiative. \n \n4.  From 2001 to 2017, the APEC FRTI has provided 150 training programs for more than \n6,200 financial regulators from 53 economies. The top 10 economies who have actively sent their \nregulators to APEC FRTI trainings are Cambodia; the People\u2019s Republic of China; Hong Kong, \nChina; Indonesia; Malaysia; Nepal; the Philippines; Sri Lanka; Taipei,China; and Thailand. Other \nparticipating  countries  include  Bangladesh,  Fiji,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  the  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, Maldives, Papua New Guinea, and Viet Nam. The APEC FRTI is a strong \nplatform for junior to mid-level regional financial regulators to share supervisory experiences and \nexchange views on emerging risks and new trends in the financial services industry.  \n \n5.  Despite the long duration of the initiative, there still exists a strong demand for the \ncontinuation of the APEC FRTI by all stakeholders because of continued emergence of new \nfinancial risks and given that the initiative is highly effective. Participants rated most of the training \nseminars under the initiative as either excellent or satisfactory. In the survey conducted in March \n2017, 97% of the 243 respondents agreed that it helped enhance their capacity, and 99% \nindicated that the initiative should be continued. \n \n6.  Two advisory groups\u2014one for bank supervisors and the other for securities regulators\u2014\ncomposed of 40 agencies from 24 countries have repeatedly confirmed the crucial need to \ncontinue the initiative. 7 The two advisory groups collectively sent ADB a letter of support for the \nAPEC FRTI in 2012, and reiterated their strong request for the extension of the program at the \nlatest advisory group meeting held in June 2017. \n \n7.  At the APEC Senior Financial Officials Meeting held in May 2017 in Ninh Binh, Viet Nam, \nAPEC members emphasized the value of the APEC FRTI and encouraged ADB to find a way to \ncontinue the program after the completion of the ongoing TA in December 2017.  \n \n8.  The APEC FRTI capacity building programs are even more crucial during these times of \nfast-growing financial and technological innovations. The rapid development of and increasing \ndependence  on  new  technologies  of  financial  services,  such  as  blockchain  and  financial \ntechnology, creates new risks, which in turn calls for innovative regulation and supervision policies \nwhile creating opportunities for better consumer outcomes. It is important that regulators and \nsupervisors can make the necessary regulatory adjustments and ensure that associated risks are \nwell managed. Regional regulators have signaled concerns about the industry\u2019s ability to handle \ntechnological challenges and regard growing cybersecurity risks as one of the major threats, with \nimplications for the overall stability of the financial system. Also, regulatory policies are crossing \ninternational  borders  because  of  increasing  cross-border  financial  transactions  and  data \nexchanges, creating the need for financial regulators to have regular dialogue with their regional \ncounterparts. \n \n                                                \n7  The consultative groups formed in 1998 at the request of APEC to evaluate the regional training programs have been \ntransformed to advisory groups since the APEC FRTI was endorsed. The advisory groups determine the topic of \ntraining programs based on priorities identified by members and seminar participants. The advisory group of bank \nsupervisors comprises members from Australia; Bhutan; Brunei Darussalam; the People\u2019s Republic of China; Cook \nIslands; Fiji; Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; Japan; the Republic of Korea; Malaysia; the Philippines; Singapore; \nTaipei,China; Thailand; the United States of America; Viet Nam; and the South East Asian Central Banks Research \nand  Training  Centre.  The  advisory  group  of  security  regulators  comprises  representatives  from  Australia; \nBangladesh; Brunei Darussalam; Cambodia; the People\u2019s Republic of China; Fiji; Hong Kong, China; India; \nIndonesia; Japan; the Republic of Korea; Malaysia; Maldives; Mongolia; New Zealand; the Philippines; Singapore; \nSri Lanka; Taipei,China; Thailand; the United States of America; and Viet Nam. \n ", "3 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: improved financial stability with effective \nsupervision and regulation of participating DMCs. The TA will have the following outcome: \nenhanced capacity of financial regulators and supervisors and strengthened regional cooperation \namong participating DMCs in addressing evolving risks and vulnerabilities of the finance sector. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Capacity building programs developed and conducted. The TA will support \nat least seven seminars per year in collaboration with DMC government institutions. At least two \nout of the seven seminars will be conducted in close collaboration with ADB regional departments \nwhich are implementing finance sector development programs in countries such as Cambodia, \nIndonesia, Mongolia, the Philippines, and Viet Nam. The training program in those countries will \nbe customized to take the different stages of finance sector development into account. They will \nalso be coordinated with other existing capacity building programs such as those offered by the \nSouth East Asian Central Banks Research and Training Centre, the International Monetary Fund, \nand the International Organization of Securities Commissions to avoid overlaps. \n \n11.  The TA will continue to follow the cost-sharing scheme among stakeholders, with (i) the \nhost economy bearing the venue cost, (ii) participating economies financing the travel expenses \nof their staff (e.g., airfares, accommodation, and other allowances), and (iii) ADB financing the \nexpenses for resource persons (mostly travel-related costs) and managerial and administrative \nsupport (e.g., consultants).  \n \n12.  Output  2:  Knowledge  and  information  on  emerging  financial  risks  effectively \ndisseminated. More than 15 presentation materials, on average, will be uploaded to k-Learn8 \nand shared with the public, and more than two regional case studies, on average, will be \ndeveloped and used as learning materials. \n \n13.  The TA  will  support  capacity  building  programs  to  help  DMCs  and  APEC  member \ncountries gain knowledge on emerging risks in the finance sector. The seminar topics will be \ndetermined through discussions among member countries. Each participating country will be \nrequested to prioritize their training needs, from which possible host countries may choose \nseminar/s to conduct. Focus will be given to regulatory issues related to digital financial services, \nfinancial technology, financial inclusion, cybersecurity, etc. \n \n14.  The training programs will continue to be customized following the needs of DMCs and \nwill include case studies to allow participants to apply their learning to their actual work. Also, in-\ndepth discussion sessions will be conducted where participants will discuss and share their \nexperiences and analyze actual issues.  \n \n15.  With consent from the resource persons, the learning materials will be uploaded to k-Learn \nand shared with the public.   \n \n \n                                                \n8  An online repository of knowledge products from ADB learning events. http://k-learn.adb.org/   \n ", "4   \n \nC.
