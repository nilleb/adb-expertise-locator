The Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Economic Cooperation Program launched in \n1992 promotes closer economic ties and cooperation among the six countries1 that share the \nMekong River.  Home to about 300 million people, the subregion with its rich human and natural \nresources presents vast opportunities and challenges for cooperation and integration in the \ncontinuing efforts to reduce poverty, achieve sustainable growth, and improve living standards. \nThe  GMS  Program  is  anchored  on  three  pillars:  enhanced  connectivity,  increased \ncompetitiveness, and a greater sense of community. To date, the GMS Program has promoted \nsubregional  cooperation  in  the  following  key  sectors:  transportation,  energy, \ntelecommunications,  human  resource  development  (HRD),  tourism,  environment,  trade, \ninvestment, and agriculture. \n2.   A 10-year GMS strategic framework (GMS-SF) (2002\u20132012), founded on a common \nvision for an integrated, prosperous, and more equitably developed Mekong subregion, was \nendorsed by GMS countries at the 10th GMS Ministerial Conference in 2002. The SF identifies \nHRD as one of the five strategic areas of cooperation, as it has the potential to enhance \ncompetitiveness  and  increase  the  returns  from  connectivity,  while  building  a  sense  of \ncommunity  through  collective  action  on  common  cross-border  HRD  concerns.  The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) has been actively supporting the GMS Working Group on HRD \n(WGHRD) to facilitate cooperation on HRD issues since its establishment in 1996. Successful \nHRD initiatives include the well-known Phnom Penh Plan for Development Management, which \nfocuses  on  building  the  capacity  of  senior  and  middle-level  public  officials  and  promotes \ndialogue on key development issues of interest to GMS countries. \n \n3.  Despite  the  strong  and  active  interest  in  regional  HRD  initiatives,  subregional \ncooperation and activities have been difficult, given the multisectoral nature and the lack of a \nHRD SF. This regional technical assistance (RETA)2 is being undertaken to assist the GMS \nWGHRD in preparing a SF and an action plan to identify a common vision and outline strategic \npriorities to be pursued over the medium term. The TA design and monitoring framework \nidentifying the main inputs, outputs, and outcome of the RETA is in Appendix 1.  \n \n \nII.  ISSUES  \n4.  Although the WGHRD has been in existence since 1996 and has implemented 17 \nprojects, generating substantive regional cooperation for HRD issues has been difficult for a \nnumber of reasons. First, the multisectoral nature of HRD requires different sector agencies to \ncollaborate on common issues and this task has not been easy since government agencies tend \nto be focused on their individual sector issues. Second, GMS countries are at various stages of \ndevelopment and while the benefits of cooperation are recognized, it has been difficult to \nidentify joint HRD activities. Third, the momentum of WGHRD deliberations, activities, and \npriorities  varied  over  the  past  decade  in  line  with  changing  country  representation. \nConsequently,  the  approach  to  subregional  cooperation  in  HRD  has  largely  been  ad  hoc, \nfocused on the health sector, and lacks a clearly defined SF and comprehensive work program. \nThese shortcomings have been recognized by both ADB and the WGHRD. \n \n                                                 \n1  GMS countries include Cambodia, Yunnan Province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam.  \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 28 April 2007. \n ", "2   \n5.  A recent midterm review3 of the GMS-SF (2002\u20132012) indicated that the GMS Program \nhas made very good progress in the \u201chardware\u201d aspects of cooperation, but emphasized that \nmore effort is needed on the \u201csoftware\u201d components. More attention is required to transform \nimproved  connectivity  into  accelerated  improvements  in  livelihood  activities  and  poverty \nreduction. Negative externalities associated with improved connectivity and mobility of people \nand goods, e.g., transmission of communicable diseases and illegal migration of workers, need \nparticular attention. To strengthen the effectiveness of subregional cooperation in HRD, the Mid-\nTerm Review suggested (i) the formulation of a GMS-SF and action plan for HRD cooperation; \n(ii) strengthening of institutional arrangements and support to the WGHRD; and (iii) pursuit of \ncooperation in labor issues, e.g., labor migration, labor standards, human trafficking, skills \ncompetencies and standards, and protection of migrant workers.   \n \n6.  Some emerging challenges for the WGHRD in defining a SF with  a clear set of priorities \nfor  HRD  cooperation  include  (i)  effectively  addressing  the  intersectoral  nature  of  HRD  to \nmaximize returns to investments, (ii) identifying key intersectoral HRD priorities common to the \nGMS  vs.  identifying  many  sector-specific  challenges,  (iii)  addressing  weak  institutional \nmechanisms for championing the HRD agenda within each GMS country and in the region as a \nwhole, (iv) raising and directing resources for adequate investment in HRD, and (v) targeting \nassistance to deal with negative externalities arising from ongoing social and economic changes. \n \n7.  In the absence of an overall HRD SF, it has been difficult to prioritize HRD initiatives that \nexplicitly link improvements in health and education with labor productivity, while simultaneously \naddressing potential social impacts of improved connectivity. Weak institutional mechanisms \nand frequently changing WGHRD membership has led to problems of (i) continuity and follow- \nthrough on the HRD agenda, (ii) weak coordination, and (iii) changing priorities. Without an \noverall HRD vision, the regional HRD challenges and agenda will not be realized. \n \n8.  HRD needs to be considered in an intersectoral context, since returns to HRD are \ngreatest  when  synergies  are  built  between  investments  in  health,  education,  and  labor \nproductivity. Some major issues identified and discussed by WGHRD-8 (May 2007) highlight the \nintersectoral  nature  of  problems  to  be  addressed.  For  instance,  measures  for  increasing \ncompetitiveness of the GMS, such as increasing opportunities for cross-border training and \naccreditation of workers, would provide greater benefits if they are matched with improvements \nin labor migration policies. In the education sector, key regional challenges continue to be the \nneed to improve the quality of education in general, and skills training in particular. For instance, \nthe  development  of  harmonized  skills  standards  and  accreditation  is  required  to  support \nincreased and improved labor mobility. Mutual recognition of qualification standards especially \nin the area of technical and vocational training would facilitate and support labor mobility across \nthe region. In the longer term, mutual recognition of diplomas and degrees would require the \ndevelopment of common standards and comparability. In the health sector, the challenge for the \nsubregion is the current low priority accorded to improving the delivery of health services for the \npoor,  and  understanding  just  how  vital  that  is  for  education  attainment  as  well  as  labor \nproductivity. Key challenges are, therefore, improvements in public health financing, health \nsystems  development,  and  better  regulation  by  explicitly  making  the \n                                                 \n3  Findings of the Midterm Review of the GMS Strategic Framework (February 2007) were discussed at the GMS \nSenior Officials\u2019 Meeting held in Siem Reap, Cambodia, 4 April 2007, and were presented at the 14th GMS \nMinisterial Conference in June 2007. \n ", "3 \nlinkage between improved health outcomes, labor productivity, and poverty reduction among \nthose  healthy  enough  to  be  employed.  The  WGHRD  can  provide  an  excellent  forum  for \ndeveloping  the  common  standards,  exchange  of  information  and  formulating  strategies  for \nimproved cooperation and collaboration in this regard. Appendix 2 outlines four relevant inter-\nsectoral approaches to HRD that will need to be considered by the WGHRD to help identify \npriorities for regional cooperation over the medium term.   \n \n9.  Finally, investments in HRD relate both to raising the quality of human resources and to \naddressing the potential negative impacts associated with rapidly changing economic and social \nenvironments.  Some  of  the  more  severe  negative  effects  from  increased  connectivity  and \nregional integration relate to spread of HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases, female and \nchild trafficking, and illegal migration. The HRD SF will need to identify means to effectively \ntackle these negative externalities that can erode gains from investment in HRD. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The intended impact of the RETA is enhanced cooperation in HRD in the GMS. The \noutcome is an agreed-upon HRD agenda for the GMS over the medium term. The latter will be \nachieved through the development of a HRD SF and an accompanying action plan to be \nconsidered by the GMS Senior Officials. Endorsement by the GMS countries of the SF will bring \nfocus to the WGHRD and galvanize commitment to implement HRD priorities and initiatives to \nsupport implementation of the GMS strategic development framework for 2007\u20132012. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The  RETA  will  be  implemented  through  a  consultative  process  involving  multiple \nstakeholders. It will include (i) a review of the WGHRD (1\u20138) proceedings, (ii) a review of \nrelevant reports of ADB and GMS governments and partners; (iii) consultative meetings and \nworkshops  with  government,  nongovernment  agencies,  and  development  partners  in  each  \nGMS country; and (iv) review of HRD development strategies and best practices pursued by \nother countries in the GMS. The RETA will support three specific outputs and related activities \noutlined below: \n \n  1.  A Comprehensive GMS-HRD Strategic Framework \n \n12.  The SF to be developed by the WGHRD through consultation with stakeholders will (i) \ninclude the vision and mission statements for HRD in the GMS, (ii) identify key strategies for \nachieving them, (iii) outline the core programs/priority initiatives for the medium term, (iv) identify \nresource requirements for priority initiatives, (v) identify strategic alliances and partnerships with \nacademic/policy advisory institutes, and (vi) propose institutional mechanisms for HRD. The SF \nwill  be  formally  reviewed  and  revised  every  3  years  by  the  WGHRD  so  as  to  ensure  its \ncontinuing relevance. \n \n  2.  An HRD Action Plan for Priority Initiatives  \n \n13.  An action plan for HRD cooperation will be prepared and will include priority initiatives to \nbe pursued over the medium term. The action plan will take into consideration (i) common \npotential  benefits  to  GMS  countries,  (ii)  the  implementing  capacity  in  the  countries,  (iii) \n ", "4 \nongoing regional initiatives led by other regional cooperation bodies such as the Association of \nSoutheast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN),  and  (iv)  support  for  HRD  being  provided  by  other \ndevelopment partners. Examples of potential initiatives include developing harmonized skills \nstandards and accreditation, adopting common labor standards and safe migration policies,  \nrecognizing  cross-border  health  certification,  and  measures  to  improve  surveillance  and \ncooperation on cross-border communicable diseases. Initiatives for HRD cooperation will be \ncarefully chosen to avoid overlap with ongoing initiatives within the subregion.  \n \n  3.  Consultation Mechanisms for Continuing GMS Cooperation on HRD Issues \n \n14.  While the SF will identify formal institutional structures to support HRD, the RETA will \nsupport  subsector  dialogue  and  consultation  among  GMS  countries  on  priority  initiatives \nidentified above. Support will be provided for convening consultative meetings/workshops of the \nWGHRD from November 2007 to October 2008. \n \n15.  The  main  assumptions  for  achieving  the  outputs  relate  to  (i)  the  willingness  of \ndevelopment partners to share information on their current and future regional HRD initiatives, (ii) \nappropriate level of representation and feedback from the government and stakeholders, and (iii) \neffective coordination of implementation arrangements. The main risk from outputs achieving \nthe outcome is that national HRD priorities may take precedence over regional priorities. The SF \nwill identify measures to reduce that risk.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n16.  The total cost of the TA is $200,000 financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s technical \nassistance funding program. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB will be the Executing Agency of the RETA, while the Social Sectors Division of the \nSoutheast  Asia  Department  of  ADB  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency.  The  GMS  national \nWGHRD focal points, in consultation with the GMS WGHRD sector-specific focal persons, will \nbe responsible for (i) coordinating activities for priority initiatives identified under the HRD SF; (ii) \ndeveloping and invigorating partnerships between the WGHRD, civil society, the private sector \nand development partners; and (iii) actively seeking national and regional resources to continue \nthe work of the WGHRD beyond that financed under the RETA. The RETA will be implemented \nover 12 months (November 2007\u2013October 2008). \n \n18.  The  RETA  will  require  3  person-months  of  international  and  12  person-months  of \nnational consulting services, with direct selection of individual consultants. The international \nconsultant  will  be  a  specialist  in  HRD  strategy  and  program  development.  The  national \nconsultant will support the international consultant in developing the HRD SF as well as facilitate \nwork related to the WGHRD. Outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4. \nThe consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants 2007 (as amended from time to time).  \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $200,000 on a grant basis for \nStrengthening Human Resource Development Cooperation in the Greater Mekong Subregion, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", " \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n(November 2007\u2013October 2008) \n \nDesign  Performance Targets/Indicators  Data Sources/Reporting Mechanisms   Assumptions  \nSummary  and Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \nEnhanced human resource  Development of progressive policies  HRD policies for GMS countries included  \u2022  Key stakeholders continue to be \ndevelopment (HRD) cooperation in  and implementation of regional  in medium-term planning documents;  committed to support subregional HRD \nthe Greater Mekong Subregion  initiatives for improving HRD by  sector policy directives  cooperation initiatives. \n(GMS)   2015    Risk \n    Reports of government, national and   \u2022  Regulatory issues impede \n  Development of policies to address  international organizations ( e.g., Asian  implementation of cross-border \n  negative externalities of greater  Development Bank (ADB), International  initiatives. \n  regional cooperation by 2015  Bank for Reconstruction and   \n    Development (IBRD), Senior Officials\u2019 \n  Increased and safer migration of  Meeting (SOM), International Labour \n  labor across GMS countries by 2015  Organization (ILO), World Health \n    Organization (WHO), and media reports \n  Regular dialogue among the   \n  Working Group on HRD (WGHRD)  Reports of  WGHRD meetings; minutes \n  and nongovernment and private  of other consultative meetings \n  sector partners on HRD policy \n  development by 2010 \nOutcome      Assumption \nAn  agreed HRD agenda for the GMS  Endorsement of the Strategic  Minutes of WGHRD, SOM meetings   \u2022  WGHRD members advocate effectively \nfor the medium term  Framework for HRD cooperation    with their relevant ministers for adoption \n  and Action Plan for priority initiatives    of the medium-term HRD agenda. \nobtained from GMS member  Risk \ncountries  \u2022  National HRD priorities take precedence \nover regional priorities.  \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

The  significant  progress  in  socioeconomic  reforms  and  reduction  in \npoverty rates in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) since the mid-1980s is attributable in a \nlarge part to the subregion\u2019s increased openness to regional and global markets and to steady \nstructural and regulatory reforms.1 Current measures outlined by GMS countries to further \npromote investment and enhance productivity include the development of human resources \nthrough health, education, and training services; transformation of state-owned enterprises; \ninvestments  in  small-  and  large-scale  infrastructure;  development  of  transparent  legal  and \nregulatory  frameworks;  and  strengthening  of  the  banking  and  financial  services  sectors. \nRegional integration with more developed countries such as People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, \nRepublic of Korea, and Thailand is also recognized as essential for further development of GMS \ncountries.  \n \n2.   Accompanying the gains in gross domestic product growth rates and decline in the \npoverty rates2 have been an increase in income inequalities between rural and urban areas and \nrising income differentials between skilled and unskilled workers. In addition, a number of cross-\nborder problems arising from disparities in development of GMS countries vis-\u00e0-vis their more \ndeveloped neighbors (such as illegal labor migration, human trafficking, and potential for a rise \nin communicable diseases) have emerged. If unchecked, such problems could lead to tensions \nand threaten the sensitive economic and social balance in the region. \n \n3.   Approaches.  Human  resource  development  (HRD)  essentially  occurs  within  an \nintersectoral context. The following key approaches to HRD will need to be explored in the \nprocess of developing the GMS HRD strategic framework, so as to identify areas with the \ngreatest potential to contribute to social and economic development in the GMS over the \nmedium term:      \n \n(i)  Human development through integrated health and education programs. \nThis  approach  relates  to  measures  of  human  development  captured  in  the \nhuman development index and reflected in the Millennium Development Goals. \nAll GMS countries are focusing on this aspect, but there appears to be a need for \nbetter integration of programs involving nutrition, cognitive development, and \nbasic  health  conditions  for  children  that  set  the  pace  for  human  capital \ndevelopment and competitiveness in the future. This HRD perspective will be of \nparticular relevance to countries affected by increased migration of caregivers, \nwhich can have an adverse impact on health and learning abilities (despite the \nincrease in remittances and income). It therefore has implications for how public \npolicy in education and health services can be better integrated and how these \nservices  can  be  better  delivered,  to  contribute  to  both  the  \u201ccommunity\u201d  and \n\u201ccompetitiveness\u201d elements of the overall GMS strategy.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

Measures to increase productivity and competitiveness have included investments \nin infrastructure, labor-intensive manufacturing as well as the financial sector. With an improved balance of trade \nprimarily due to gains in the manufacturing sector, gross domestic product grew an average of 6.8% for Cambodia \n(1999\u20132002), 7.5% for Viet Nam (1995\u20132005), and 6.3% for the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) \n(2001\u20132005). Source: Asian Development Bank\u2019s country strategy programs for the Lao PDR (September 2006), \nCambodia (February 2005), and Viet Nam (September 2006). \n2  In Viet Nam, the poverty rate declined from 58.1% in 1993 to 23.2% in 2004; in the Lao PDR, it declined from 46% \nin 1992 to 33% in 2003, while in Cambodia, the poverty rate decreased from 39% in 1994 to 28% in 2004 in \ngeographically comparable areas. \n ", "8              Appendix 2   \n \n(ii)  Human capital development through skills training directed at domestic \nand regional economic growth hubs. This approach to HRD is particularly \nattractive for countries that are industrializing and includes investment in short- to \nmedium-term skills training, particularly for the youth (16\u201325 years of age), to \nfulfill the emerging requirements for industrial and services growth hubs. This \napproach  also  requires  a  multisectoral  and  regional  response,  given  the \nincreased connectivity and increasing migration of labor within GMS countries \nand  to  neighboring  countries.  Intersectoral  policy  issues  related  to  skills \nstandards, accreditation of skills, health insurance schemes, minimum working \nconditions,  social  protection,  and  labor  regulation/contractual  obligations  will \nneed to be explored in terms of how they are affected by increased connectivity \nand competitiveness.     \n \n(iii)  Human resource development within the public services. This approach will \nmeet the requirements of transitioning economies through training for legislation \nand  regulation  to  attract  investment,  corporatize/privatize  state-owned \nenterprises, as well as deal with retrenchment issues. To a certain extent, this \napproach is being followed under the Phnom Penh Plan.
