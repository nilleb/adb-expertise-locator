Statistical systems in the Asia and Pacific region urgently need to be developed and \nmodernized. The timely availability of reliable statistical data is increasingly important to the \ndevelopment  communities,  particularly  with  the  adoption  of  Millennium  Development  Goals \n(MDGs) and the Managing for Development Results (MfDR) approach. Without such data,  \nMDG and MfDR results and impact cannot be monitored. However, for various reasons, national \nstatistical systems (NSSs) in most developing member countries (DMCs) often cannot produce \nthe needed data on time. Although the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has long experience in \nstatistical capacity building (SCB), a more systematic approach to SCB and to the monitoring of \nthe implementation of SCB technical assistance (TA) is still needed, in line with ADB\u2019s more \nsystematic approach to its other activities. \n \n2.  On  16  January  2006  an  Economics  and  Research  Department  (ERD)  paper  titled \nStatistical Capacity Building in the Asian and Pacific Region,1 presenting the new approach to \nSCB, was approved by the President. It marked a move from an ad hoc to a systems approach \nto providing statistical assistance. ADB assistance will henceforth focus on building the capacity \nof the statistically very weak DMCs under a long-term program.2 SCB will be integrated into the \ncountry  and  strategy  program  (CSP)  and  will  be  designed  and  implemented  with  the  full \nownership of both DMCs and regional departments (RDs)3 and with technical support from \nERD.4 To  implement  the  new  SCB  approach,  a  regional  technical  assistance  (RETA)  is \nproposed to assess the statistical capacity, constraints, and needs of DMCs; to identify DMCs \nthat are statistically very weak; and to develop separate long-term SCB TA programs for those \nDMCs.5  The RETA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The current approach to SCB TA does not involve a systematic review of the need for an \nSCB TA program in a DMC and its relevance to the DMC\u2019s own statistical development strategy. \nNor does it involve an assessment of whether an SCB TA request from a DMC matches ADB\u2019s \nown priority goals for statistical development in the region. \n \n4.  In the past, the selection of SCB TA programs was based on ad hoc requests made by \nindividual  DMCs  through  the  RDs  rather  than  on  systematic  strategic  considerations.  The \nprograms were implemented piecemeal and were not systematically monitored. In providing \nSCB  TA  to  the  statistically  very  weak  DMCs  in  future,  ADB  must  consider  how  these \nshortcomings can be overcome. One option would be to consider the prospects for success of \nthose DMCs\u2019 statistical systems, since the TA can provide much-needed help but cannot by \nitself determine the success or failure of the system. For this, however, the prospects for \nsuccess, country by country, must be systematically evaluated.  \n \n5.  In the experience of ERD, common obstacles to statistical development are (i) lack of \npolitical will, (ii) lack of transparency, (iii) chronic budgetary insufficiency for routine statistical \nactivities, and (iv) high staff turnover, undermining the effectiveness of training. The long-term \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006. Statistical Capacity Building in the Asian and Pacific Region. Manila. \n2  Statistically very weak DMCs also tend to be weakly performing DMCs. \n3  In this paper, RDs include resident missions. \n4  The project administration will be handled by the RDs, while ERD will play a major role in the technical aspects of \nthe TA, including the recruitment of consultants, and participation in inception, review, and technical consultations \nmissions as needed. \n5  The RETA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 14 March 2006. \n ", "2   \nSCB TA program must address these obstacles if the TA is to be successful. A major deciding \nfactor in providing an SCB TA program is the commitment shown by a statistically very weak \nDMC to develop its NSS, including the allocation of a sufficient budget for sustained statistical \nactivities.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  This RETA is aimed at assisting selected statistically very weak DMCs in providing more \naccurate, relevant, and timely statistical information by developing long-term SCB TA programs \nthat are agreed upon by RDs and these DMCs. The RETA will have two major outputs, namely, \ndiagnostic studies and draft long-term SCB TA programs for the selected statistically very weak \nDMCs, which will be the basis for statistical development in these countries. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The RETA outputs will be obtained through a combination of (i) consulting services, \n(ii) country  consultations,  (iii)  support  for  data  collection,  (iv)  processing,  (v)  analysis,  and \n(vi) dissemination.  The  RETA  will  be  implemented  in  two  phases.  Phase  1  will  lay  the \ngroundwork  by  (i)  pulling  together  and  synthesizing  available  studies  and  information, \n(ii) identifying criteria to determine the statistically very weak DMCs, and (iii) collecting basic \ninformation. In this first phase, 13 DMCs will be reviewed: Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, \nBangladesh, Bhutan, Kyrgyz Republic, Maldives, Mongolia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Timor-\nLeste, and Viet Nam.6 The choice of the 13 DMCs was based on (i) cost considerations, (ii) \neligibility for Asian Development Fund (ADF) grants, (iii) existence of an ADB TA/RETA on SCB, \n(iv) likelihood that these DMCs are statistically very weak given the low availability of relevant \ndata in these countries, and (v) the frameworks used by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) \nin certifying the adequacy of published statistical data in various countries for the needs of data \nusers.7   \n \n8.  Phase 1 will have three key activities: (i) assessing the level of statistical development of \nthe 13 DMCs, (ii) identifying statistically very weak DMCs from among the 13 DMCs and \nselecting candidates for SCB TA projects, and (iii) conducting diagnostic studies for the selected \nstatistically  very  weak  DMCs.  Phase  2  will  have  two  key  activities,  namely  (i)  developing \nseparate long-term SCB TA programs for the statistically very weak DMCs that are selected for \nSCB TA projects, on the basis of their national strategy for the development of statistics, in \nphase 1; and (ii) preparing a monitoring template for each selected statistically very weak DMC.8    \n \n                                                 \n6  Six of the 13 DMCs are poor, debt stressed, or post-conflict DMCs that are among those listed in ADB. 2004. The \nADF IX Grants Program: Staff Instructions. Compendium of Staff Instructions (approved by the President on 23 \nNovember). Available: Lotus Notes database, LNADBG1. \n7  The two frameworks are the General Data Dissemination Standard (GDDS) and the Special Data Dissemination \nStandard (SDDS). The GDDS involves a basic level of data availability, while SDDS involves a higher level of \navailability. Of the 13 DMCs covered by the RETA, eight already participate in the GDDS, two (Armenia and Kyrgyz \nRepublic) subscribe to SDDS, and three (Bhutan, Maldives, and Timor-Leste) have not subscribed to either GDDS \nor SDDS.  \n8  Many DMCs have either prepared or are preparing a national strategy for development statistics in response to the \ncall in the Marrakech Action Plan for Statistics for the implementation of such strategies in every low-income \ncountry by 2006. The availability of these strategies in DMCs will therefore provide a good basis for ADB \ninvolvement in SCB.  \n ", "  3\n9.  To minimize the risk of failure in implementing an SCB TA program, ADB will consider a \nportfolio approach in giving SCB TA to the selected statistically weak DMCs. This would involve \n(i)  giving  more  assistance  to  countries  with  stronger  prospects  for  a  successful  outcome, \n(ii) setting  clear  conditionalities  for  countries  where  the  prospect  for  a  successful  outcome \nappears doubtful, and (iii) monitoring compliance with the conditionalities. \n \n  1.  Phase 1 \n \n  a.  Assess DMCs\u2019 Level of Statistical Development \n10.  The study will assess the 13 DMCs\u2019 level of statistical development and capacity,9 and \nidentify DMCs that are considered statistically very weak on the basis of a number of criteria, \nsuch  as  availability  of  priority  indicators,  existing  statistical  capacity,10 and  availability  of \nstandard skills.11 The study will also take into account scoring systems developed by other \nagencies for evaluating the level of statistical development of a country. The assessment will be \ncarried out in two stages. First, a desk study will clarify the concept of \u201cstatistically very weak \nDMCs\u201d and classify most cases on the basis of information already available at ADB. The desk \nstudy will take into account data available from ERD archives and on Internet sites such as \nthose of the IMF, World Bank (WB), United Nations (UN) agencies, and PARIS21.12 Second, \nfurther information will be collected for DMCs that are borderline statistically very weak. This \ninformation would be collected through e-mail, phone calls, or field visits, if necessary. During \nthe desk study and field visits, attempts will also be made to (i) identify the factors that are \nconducive  to  progress and  those  that  hinder it,  (ii)  previous  and  planned  assistance  from \nfunding agencies, and (iii) any known gaps in data and problems with data quality.  \n \n  b.  Identify Statistically Very Weak DMCs and Select Candidates \n  for SCB TA Projects \n11.  Considering other factors, including assistance already being provided by other funding \nagencies, ERD, in consultation with RDs, will select candidates for SCB TA projects from \namong the statistically very weak DMCs. Countries where other funding agencies are not yet \nheavily involved will be given preference. A set of principles for dealing with the most common \nobstacles to statistical progress will be proposed. \n \nc.  Conduct  a  Diagnostic  Study  for  Each  Selected  Statistically  Very \nWeak DMC \n12.  For  the  countries  that  are  identified  as  candidates  for  SCB  TA  projects,  national \nconsultants, with inputs from the DMCs concerned, will study existing statistical activities in \ndepth, identify major gaps in data, and determine the extent of demand for existing statistics and \n                                                 \n9  In this part of phase 1, the SCB activities of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community and Pacific Financial \nTechnical Assistance Centre for the Pacific DMCs will also be reviewed.   \n10 E.g., number of staff (by level of education), number of personal computers in use, annual budget, publication of \nannual statistical yearbook, and number of yearly surveys. \n11 Basic skills sets are related to, for instance, the ability to (i) carry out household and establishment surveys, \n(ii) develop a business registry, (iii) prepare tabulation plans, and (iv) publish survey results and prepare annual \nTheest ivmieawtess  eoxf pnreastiosneadl  haecrceoiunn atsr.e  Itnhteorsmee odfia tthee  sckoillnss uselttasn tr eafenrd  tdoo t hneo t anbeilcitye stsoa r(ii)ly  dreevperleospe an t sthamospeli nogf  AdeDsBig\u2019ns,  \nm(eiim) cboenrsstr, uBcot aarndd o af nDailryezcet oprso,v eMrtayn aagnde moethnetr,  odre sritvaefdf,  ainnddic matoarys ,b e(i iip) recolimmpinuatery  qinu anrtaetrulyr ee. s timates of national \naccounts, and (iv) disseminate data over the Internet. Advanced skills sets relate to the ability to (i) develop a \n \nmaster  sample,  (ii)  coordinate  data  collection  by  various  agencies,  (iii)  evaluate  data  and  identify  major \nweaknesses, and (iv) conduct in-house research to improve data quality. \n12 \u201cPARIS21\u201d stands for \u201cPartnership in Statistics for Development in the 21st Century.\u201d \n ", "4   \nthe types of data now collected by government agencies outside the national statistical office. \nThe study will identify factors that hinder or promote the development of statistics, and assess \nthe availability of an adequate budget for statistical development, human resources, information \ntechnology equipment, and surveys. If necessary, the diagnostic study will also recommend the \nintroduction of conditionalities in the proposed SCB TA project. \n \n2.  Phase 2  \n \n  a.  Develop  a  Long-Term  SCB  TA  Program  for  Each  Selected \n  Statistically Very Weak DMC \n \n13.  For each selected statistically very weak DMC, a long-term SCB TA program13 that is \nconsidered  most  suitable  for  ADB  involvement  will  be  developed.  It  will  be  based  on  the \ndiagnostic study in phase 1 and close consultations with the RD and DMC concerned. The long-\nterm statistical program will address issues such as the availability of a statistical legislative \nframework, management and organization of the statistical system, level of budgetary resources \navailable for statistical activities, lack of demand for existing data, and incorporation of data \ncollected by nonstatistical government agencies into the NSS. Depending on the needs of these \nDMCs, the TA will address, among others, the priority concerns of ADB, including the likelihood \nof success in preparing time-series data for selected indicators and the need for ADB to avoid \ndispersing its SCB efforts in too many directions. Dealing with such concerns will provide a \nbasis for constructing a monitoring template.  \n \n14.  ADB will explore various sources of financing, including loans, and the possibility of \ncreating a statistical capacity building trust fund for the SCB TA programs that are developed. At \nthe same time, to ensure effective SCB TA implementation and the long-term sustainability of \nthe SCB TA activities beyond the life of the SCB TA, the SCB TA programs should include \nappropriate conditionalities. These would include the release of funds only after the selected \nstatistically very weak DMC concerned has satisfactorily reached predetermined and agreed \nmilestones and shown its firm commitment to (i) deploy more resources to statistical activities, \n(ii) enhance transparency by fully disclosing background information according to international \nguidelines and standards, and (iii) ensure more independent statistical offices. Where necessary, \nthe SCB TA program will also stipulate a clear exit strategy for ADB that will allow ADB to pass \nthe funding of most of the statistics budget onto the government of the selected statistically very \nweak DMC, after a specified interval. These conditionalities will help remove common obstacles \nto statistical development.  \n \n    b.  Prepare a Monitoring Template \n \n15.  For  each  selected  statistically  very  weak  DMC,  a  monitoring  template  showing  the \navailability of major priority indicators in selected areas will be prepared. Priority will be given to \nthose areas of statistics where ADB has considerable experience and some real success in \nproviding assistance, namely, poverty statistics, national accounts statistics, price statistics (in \nparticular the consumer price index), household and business enterprise surveys, etc. Priority \nconsideration will also be given to strengthening MDG indicators. But given the diversity of \nthese indicators, only a limited number, including the poverty rate indicator, will be addressed, to \nensure no loss of focus. The fulfillment of conditionalities will also be included in the template.  \n \n                                                 \n13 Before this program is developed, it may be necessary to ensure that the selected statistically very weak DMCs \nhave a strong commitment to develop their NSS. \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the RETA is estimated to be $600,000. This total includes consulting \nservices, country visits, and regional and in-country seminars and workshops. The RETA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The detailed cost estimates are \ngiven in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the RETA. ERD will administer the RETA, with the \nsupport of an interdepartmental technical working group (TWG) on SCB,14 which will comprise \nstaff of ERD and RDs. The group will ensure effective coordination with the concerned RDs. \n \n18.  The study will be implemented over 18 months, from August 2006 to December 2007, \nwith the assistance of a team of international and national consultants, to be selected and hired \nindividually, according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The terms of reference of \nthe consultants are in Appendix 3. The results of the first phase of the RETA will be the basis for \nfirming up the design and scope of the second phase, which will begin right after phase 1. The \nresults thus far of the first phase and approach to diagnostic studies will be discussed at a \nregional  workshop  in  February  2007,  to  be  attended  by  high-level  officials  of  the  DMCs \nconcerned, among others. The intent is to secure their commitment to implement the SCB TA \nprograms. \n \n19.  The national consultants, in consultation with ADB and under the overall guidance of the \ninternational consultant, will undertake the country diagnostic studies and develop long-term \nSCB TA programs for the selected statistically very weak DMCs. The national consultants will \nsubmit  their  reports  within  2  weeks  after  completing  their  assignment.  The  international \nconsultant will consolidate all country studies and prepare a draft final report on ADB\u2019s SCB \nprogram, which will be discussed at the RETA concluding workshop in September 2007. The \nworkshop will be attended by senior statisticians of the selected statistically very weak DMCs, \nmembers  of  the  TWG  on  SCB,  RD  and  resident  mission  staff,  international  and  national \nconsultants,  and  resource  persons  from  international  organizations,  among  others.  The \ninternational consultant will finalize the report, after incorporating the comments of the workshop \nparticipants, and submit it to ADB by the end of October 2007.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis for \nStatistical Capacity Building in the Asia and Pacific Region, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n                                                 \n \n14 The terms of reference of the TWG on SCB include (i) coordinating SCB work between the RDs and ERD, \n(ii) providing advisory services in implementing the new approach to SCB, and (iii) sharing lessons learned by the \nvarious departments from past SCB TA projects.  \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact      Assumptions \nEnhanced, improved,  Up to half of selected  Publications, reports,  Selected statistically very \nand sustainable  statistically very weak  and Web sites of  weak DMCs adopt and \nstatistical capacity in  DMCs regularly and  selected statistically  are committed to \nselected statistically  sustainably produce  very weak DMCs  implementing the \nvery weak DMCs  and disseminate  programs and provide \n  timely, reliable,  counterpart resources \naccurate, and   \nrelevant statistics  ADB provides selected \nafter the TA, as  statistically very weak \nprovided for in the  DMCs with SCB TA \nlong-term SCB TA  programs \nprograms \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nLong-term SCB TA  At least 50% of the  Country and strategy  RDs give priority to SCB \nprograms in selected  SCB TA programs  programs (CSPs)   TA programs and \nstatistically very weak  are funded by ADB  incorporate them into their \nDMCs, as agreed    CSPs   \nupon by these DMCs   \nand RDs   Selected statistically very \nweak DMCs incorporate \nthe SCB TA programs into \ntheir respective country \ndevelopment plans and \nare committed to \nimplementing the \nprograms \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

International Statistics Consultant (5 person-months, intermittently) \n1.  The international statistical consultant should have a strong background in statistics or \neconomics, extensive practical working experience with statistical offices in developing countries, \nand  sufficient  knowledge  of  statistical  development  in  the  region.  The  consultant  will  provide \nnecessary guidance to the national consultants, who will undertake a diagnostic study and a long-\nterm  statistical  capacity  building  (SCB)  technical  assistance  (TA)  program  for  each  selected \nstatistically very weak developing member country (DMC).   \n \n2.  In particular, the consultant will perform the following tasks: \n \n(i)  Review  indicators  that  have  been  used  to  assess  the  statistical  capabilities  of \nnational statistical systems (NSSs), taking into account scoring systems developed \nby other agencies for evaluating the level of statistical development of a country. \n \n(ii)  Using available materials, conduct a desk study to assess the level of statistical \ndevelopment of selected DMCs. Where necessary, seek further information through \ne-mail, telephone, or, if necessary, field visits. Also take note of the countries that \nalready receive extensive statistical assistance from other funding agencies, the \navailability of data, the history of assistance from funding agencies, and any known \ngaps in data and problems with the quality of data.  \n \n(iii)  Identify statistically very weak DMCs on the basis of the assessment. To the extent \npossible, rely on existing comprehensive studies, such as the national strategy for \nthe development of statistics.  \n \n(iv)  Prepare  a  detailed  and  annotated  outline  to  guide  the  national  consultants  in \ndeveloping diagnostic studies and long-term SCB TA programs, and guide and \nsupervise the national consultants as necessary.  \n \n(v)  Assist and guide the national consultants in conducting workshops, and provide \nother needed assistance to the regional and national workshops.  \n \n(vi)  Review  the  draft  SCB  TA  programs  prepared  by  the  national  consultants, \nconsolidate the findings and recommendations, and submit to ADB by the end of \nOctober 2007 a consolidated report on SCB that includes the comments of the \nworkshop participants.  \n \n(vii)  Prepare  draft  monitoring  templates  showing  the  availability  of  major  priority \nindicators in selected areas, with inputs from the national consultants. \n \n(viii)  Participate in the regional workshop and the concluding workshop organized by \nADB. \n \n \nB.  National Statistics Consultants (45 person-months, intermittently) \n3.
