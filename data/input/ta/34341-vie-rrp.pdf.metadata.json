The Project will \nenhance environmental quality by protecting nationally and globally \nsignificant biodiversity and improving the performance of forest-based \nenvironmental services. \n   \nProject Description  The Project addresses the problems of forest loss and degradation \nand  rural  poverty  in  Viet  Nam\u2019s  Central  Highlands  by  instituting \nsustainable forest management (SFM) over one third of the country\u2019s \nnatural forest estate, whose timber stocks are currently valued at \nabout $4.4 billion. It will do so by (i) building capacity and upgrading \nforest sector governance, management, and incentive regimes in the \nprovinces of Dak Lak, Dak Nong, Gia Lai, Kon Tum, Lam Dong, and \nPhu  Yen,  covering  over  3  million  hectares  (ha)  of  forestland; \n(ii) increasing  forestry-based  livelihood  opportunities  and  reducing \npoverty in 60 communes by involving over 80,000 of the country\u2019s \npoorest households in sustainable forestry covering 144,000 ha of \ncommune and village forestlands, which will include over 30,000 ha of \nlivelihood  plantations  established  on  bare  lands;  (iii)  creating  an \nenabling business environment; (iv) strengthening supply and market \nchains, and (v) satisfying participation requirements for the use of \ncredit enhancements that may be requested by investors and lenders \nthat wish to invest in the forestry sector in Viet Nam. \n \nThe Project objectives and activities include (i) formulating technically \nsound and socially relevant SFM plans for over 3 million ha of natural \nforests  and  plantations  on  bare  land,  with  SFM  plan  preparation \nincluding  (a)  delineating  forest  conservation  and  use  zones, \n(b) rationalizing  the  Government\u2019s  and  stakeholders\u2019  roles  and \nresponsibilities  and  enabling  effective  participation  of  the  local \ncommunities  and  the  private  sector  in  SFM,  and  (c)  providing \ninvestments for improving the condition and productivity of household, \ncommunity,  and  state-managed  forests;  (ii)  providing  wage-\ngenerating  and  livelihood-improvement  investments,  especially  for \nforest-dependent  ethnic  minorities;  (iii)  supporting  stakeholder \ntechnical and operational capacity building for SFM; and (iv) providing \nproject implementation support. \n \nAdvisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  is  required  to  (i)  provide  the \nGovernment  with  technical  and  advisory  support  for  extending ", "ii   \nproposed sustainable forest resource development and management \nto small-scale farmers and households; (ii) ensure effective livelihood \nimprovement and community support in 60 communes in the project \narea;  (iii)  facilitate  decentralized  administrative  and  financial \nmanagement; and (iv) support compliance with the ethnic minority, \ngender,  environment,  and  involuntary  resettlement  polices  of  the \nGovernment and Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (MARD)  will \nexecute the Project, and provinces will be responsible for project \nimplementation. Using a participatory diagnosis and design approach \ninvolving multiple stakeholders, a detailed needs assessment was \nundertaken in the core subproject area of Lam Dong and seven core \ncommunes  spread  over  the  project  area.  Based  on  the  needs \nassessment,  forest  resource  development  and  livelihood \nimprovement  investments  were  developed,  and  project \nimplementation strategies identified. The remaining five subprojects \nand  communes  have  been  selected  in  accordance  with  criteria \nagreed  among  MARD,  relevant  provincial  authorities,  primary \nstakeholders, and ADB. Consistent with the sector approach, detailed \nfeasibility studies for the non-core provinces and communes will be \nundertaken  in  accordance  with  a  predetermined  schedule  and \nguidelines. \n   \nRationale  Viet  Nam\u2019s  development  success,  especially  in  expanding  food \nproduction and moving from rice deficits to the world\u2019s second largest \nrice export volume, is attributed to key reforms that (i) allocated land \nto individual farmers and households, (ii) rationalized and reduced the \nrole of the state in the sector, (iii) strengthened the technical and \noperational  capacity  of  state  and  other  stakeholders,  and \n(iv) increased investments and access to markets. Viet Nam\u2019s forestry \nsector has the necessary policies, laws, and sector strategies in place \nto replicate the successful experience of the agriculture sector. But \nweak  institutional,  technical,  and  human  resource  capacity  block \nmoves  toward  pro-poor  and  market-oriented  governance  and \nincentives  for  the  sector.  Consequently,  even  in  the  Central \nHighlands, which has the highest potential in the country for forest-\nbased economic development and poverty reduction, the sector is in \nserious  decline  largely  due  to  unsustainable  resource  use  and \nexploitation. A key factor for the poor performance is the uncertainty \nover forest ownership, management, and use rights and roles. \n \nThe Government\u2019s Forest Development Strategy (2001\u20132010) and \nsector plans call for making forestry an important economic sector by \n(i) protecting and developing forest resources and increasing forest \ncover from 32% to 43% by 2010, (ii) achieving an annual growth rate \nof  over  3.5%  during  2006\u20132010,  (iii)  accelerating  and  completing \nforestland  allocation  under  the  Land  Law  and  the  revised  Forest \nProtection  and  Development  Law,  (iv)  using  forestry  to  improve \nlivelihoods and reduce poverty in mountainous areas dominated by \nethnic minorities, and (iv) increasing the efficiency and value of the ", "  iii\ncountry\u2019s wood-processing industry. The Government\u2019s policy is to \nrestrict the state\u2019s role to forest and biodiversity protection, and to let \nthe private sector dominate the production of forestry products. \n \nThe comprehensive poverty reduction and growth strategy (CPRGS) \nemphasizes the need to focus on the disadvantaged rural areas with \nhigh proportions of ethnic minorities, such as the Central Highlands, \nwhere  minorities  dominate.  These  areas  are  where  most  of  the \nremaining forest survives, and the CPRGS recognizes this. \n \nThe Central Highlands is Viet Nam\u2019s most important forestry region, \ncontributing  more  than  60%  of  the  country\u2019s  annual  hardwood \nconsumption.  Ecological  conditions  and  terrain  are  suitable  for \nsustainable forestry, as population densities are still low compared \nwith  the  country\u2019s  other  regions.  An  improving  road  network  is \nincreasing access to national and regional markets, and incremental \nwood production from the Project will mitigate the shortages of raw \nmaterial  supplies  faced  by  local  processing  enterprises.  Project \ninterventions have the potential to secure over 70% of Viet Nam\u2019s \n2010\u20132015 domestic timber needs. Accordingly, the draft 2006\u20132010 \nsocioeconomic development plan identifies the Central Highlands as \na priority forestry region. \n \nThe  Central  Highlands  is  home  to  over  5  million  people  and  the \nsecond poorest region in the country, with poverty rates as high as \n57% among ethnic minorities. Over 2.5 million people are in the work \nforce,  but  unemployment  is  high,  with  only  about  11%  in  wage-\nearning  occupations.  As  these  communities  have  forestry-relevant \nskills and knowledge, engaging them in forestry will lead to improved \nforests, forestry, and livelihoods. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  Project  will  contribute  to  Viet  Nam  Development  Goals  by \n(i) improving the condition and value of country\u2019s forests and timber \nsupply, (ii) ending hunger among 80,000 of the country\u2019s poorest \nhouseholds living near these forests, and (iii) improving the protection \nof critical watersheds and globally significant biodiversity. The specific \noutcome of the Project is enabling the Government to institute SFM \nover one-third of country\u2019s remaining natural forest resource base. \n   \nCost Estimates  The total project cost, including taxes and duties, is estimated at \n$90.66 million equivalent. \n   \n ", "iv   \n \nFinancing Plan  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $45 million equivalent from \nits Special Fund resources.  \n \nSource  Total Cost  Percent \nAsian Development Bank (ADB)  45.00  49.60 \nGovernment   18.29  20.20 \nGovernments of Finland, The  15.57  17.20 \nNetherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland \nCofinancinga \nBeneficiaries  11.80  13.00 \n  Total  90.66  100.00 \na  Trust Funds for Forests \n Source: ADB estimates. \n   \nLoan Amount and  The  Asian  Development  Bank  will  provide  a  loan  of  various \nTerms  currencies equivalent to $45 million from the Special Fund resources \nof ADB, with a maturity term of 32 years and a grace period of 8 \nyears, will be provided.

Goods, civil works, and materials will be \nprocured through international competitive bidding when valued at \nmore than $1 million equivalent, or by national competitive bidding \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB  when  valued  below  $1  million \nequivalent. Goods and materials valued at less than $100,000 may \nbe procured through shopping, and those valued at less that $10,000 \nequivalent through direct contract. To commence the Project on time, \nADB has approved, at the Government\u2019s request, advance action for \nprocurement. The Government has been advised that approval of \nadvance action does not commit  ADB to finance any part of the \nProject. \n   ", "  v\nConsulting Services   The Project will contract 5,101 person-months of consultant services. \nThis level of input is necessary to allow for the efficient and effective \nshift away from a state-dominated forest sector and will include 153 \nperson-months of international consultants and 4,948 person-months \nof  national  consultants.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  in  a  single \npackage from a firm, using quality- and cost-based selection. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will address (i) the absence of technically sound and \nBeneficiaries  socioeconomically  responsive  forest  governance  and  sustainable \nmanagement plans and (ii) institutional, management, and market \nfailures  that  constrain  the  full  and  effective  participation  of \ncommunities  and  private  sector.  At  full  development,  the  project \nplantations  will  increase  production  incrementally  by  more  than \n300,000 cubic meters annually, and total natural forest asset value \nwill likely increase from $4.4 billion to $6.4 billion. The Project will \nprovide clear forest use and management rights to households and \ncommunities by allocating forestland, and the resulting security will \nencourage  them  to  invest  in  and  manage  forest  production \nsustainably and profitably. Over 8 years, the Project will generate an \nestimated  minimum  of  23  million  person-days  of  wage-generating \nopportunities  for  households,  communities,  and  enterprises. \nCapacity-building activities will create a critical cadre of over 500 well-\ntrained forestry professionals and 1,000 technicians. \n   \nRisks and  The Project will support interventions and technologies that are well \nAssumptions  established  in  Viet  Nam\u2019s  forestry  sector  and  so  poses  minimal \ntechnical risks. \nImplementing the Government\u2019s state forest enterprise (SFE) reform \nis central to rationalizing forestland use roles, responsibilities, and \ninvestments. Failure in respect to SFE restructuring will put at risk the \npotential  for  attracting  private  investments  as  well  as  community \nsupport and participation. The following measures incorporated under \nthe Project will mitigate this risk: (i) a specific assurance from the \nGovernment to implement the state-owned enterprise reform decrees; \n(ii)  provision  by  the  Project  of  incentives  to  restructured  SFE \nemployees, including training; and (iii) leverage support through state-\nowned enterprise reform of the poverty reduction support credits. \nA  demand-driven,  market-oriented  approach  to  forest  sector \nmanagement  is  new  to  Viet  Nam  and  risks  undue  government \ninterference. To address this risk, demand-driven and stakeholder-\nbased investment planning will be emphasized under the Project. \nThis  will  also  be  the  focus  of  training  and  building  stakeholder \ncapacity and awareness. \n   \n ", " ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, (ii) a proposed administration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of a grant to be \nprovided  by  the  Trust  Fund  for  Forests,  and  (iii)  a  proposed  administration  of  technical \nassistance  (TA),  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Forests  for  Livelihood \nImprovement in the Central Highlands Sector Project. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Sector Background and Performance \n1.  Forest Sector and Sustainable Economic Development \n2.  Sixty percent of natural land in Viet Nam is classified as forestland, most of which is \nfound  in  mountainous  areas,  with  the  Central  Highlands  accounting  for  over  30%  of  the \nremaining natural forests and 60% of nation\u2019s domestic timber supply. From 1943 to 1993, Viet \nNam\u2019s forest area suffered a 35% loss, from 14.3 million ha in 1943 to 9.3 million ha in 1993. \nHowever, recent years have witnessed a reversal of this trend, which is attributed to national \nreforestation  programs  such  as  5  Million  Hectare  Reforestation  Program  (5MHRP).1 \nMountainous  regions  such  as  the  Central  Highlands  and  forest  areas  are  home  to  ethnic \nminority communities served by poor roads and limited access to social services and markets. \n \nTable 1: Forest and Land Area (Viet Nam and Central Highlands) (million ha) \n \nForest as % of  Central Highlands \nItem  Viet Nam  Central Highlands \nTotal  as % of Total \nTotal Area  32.90  \u2013  5.95  18.09 \nForestland Area  19.20  58.36  4.10  21.35 \nForested Land  10.90  33.13  3.20  29.36 \nNatural Forest   9.40  28.57  3.00  31.91 \nPlantation   1.50  4.56  0.14  9.33 \n\u2013 = data not available. \nSource: National Forest Development Strategy, 2001\u20132010. \n \n3.  The forestry sector in Viet Nam is mainly concerned with forest resource protection and \nmanagement and associated harvesting activities. The value of forestry sector output was about \n1.3% of national gross domestic product (GDP) in 2004, but this does not take into account \ndomestic processing, consumption of fuel wood and other timber products, and exports of \nwood-derived products. The current value of sector output is estimated to be around $1.8 billion, \nwhich is 5\u20136% of national GDP. Consistent with the Government\u2019s priority to maximize export \nearnings, exports of wood products increased from $530 million in 2002 to $1.5 billion in 2005. \nThe forestry sector also contributes about 7% of the nation's energy balance, mainly in the form \nof  fuel  wood.  The  role  of  forests  in  watershed  protection  and  biodiversity  conservation  is \nstrongly emphasized in the 5MHRP. \n \n4.  Meeting the Government\u2019s projected GDP growth rate of over 7% in 2005 would have \nrequired about 12 million cubic meters (m3) round wood equivalent of wood raw material, but \ncurrent official estimates put the annual supply at about 5 million\u20136 million m3. The deficit is \nbeing made up from over-harvesting of remaining forests and imports, both legal and illegal. \n                                                 \n1  5MHRP, one of the five national programs, was started in 1998 under the Prime Minister\u2019s Decision No. 661/QD-\nTTg. The program includes 2 million ha of protected and special-use forest (1 million ha of new plantations and 1 \nmillion ha of natural regeneration), and 3 million ha of production forests. ", "2 \nThe magnitude of the supply deficit suggests that the remaining forests are under considerable \nthreat  despite  logging  bans  and  official  sanctioning  of  reduced  harvesting.  Poor  forest \nmanagement and over-harvesting have resulted in forest stocks being 25\u201345% below the norm, \ncausing production and productivity losses. Productivity in natural forests and plantations is at \nhalf to quarter of their potential. Wood-processing efficiencies are at 30\u201335%, or far below the \n80\u201390% that is the international industry norm. \n \n5.  Current domestic timber prices are below import prices and are generally lower than \ninternational prices. This suggests that supply is not constrained, despite greatly reduced felling \nquotas, and reinforces the conclusion that a substantial proportion of the supply is coming from \nunofficial sources. \n \nB.  Key Challenges, Lessons Learned, and Opportunities \n1.  Key Challenges \n6.  Viet Nam\u2019s recent success in development, especially in expanding food production and \nmoving from rice deficits to the world\u2019s second largest rice export volume, is attributed to key \nreforms that (i) allocated land to individual farmers and households, (ii) rationalized and reduced \nthe role of the state in the sector, (iii) strengthened the technical and operational capacity of \nstate and other stakeholders, and (iv) increased access to investments and markets. Viet Nam\u2019s \nforestry sector has the necessary policies, laws, and sector strategies in place to replicate the \nagriculture sector experience, but institutional, regulatory, human, and technical capacity for \nmoving toward a framework of pro-poor and market-friendly governance and incentives is weak \nand, in some cases, missing. Consequently, even in the Central Highlands, which has the \nhighest potential in the country for forest-based economic development and poverty reduction, \nthe sector is in serious decline, largely due to unsustainable resource use and exploitation. A \nkey contributing factor for the poor forest management and performance is the uncertainty over \nforest ownership, management responsibilities, and use rights. \n \n7.  Rationalizing Forestland Ownership, Use, and Management. Rationalizing forestland \nownership, use, and management roles and responsibilities remains a challenge to sustainable \nforest management. Slow progress has occurred in classifying forestland, planning land use, \nand allocating land to households, communities, organizations, and non-state enterprises, both \nnationally and in the Central Highlands. Management regimes are based on administrative \nconsiderations, not on sound technical criteria. Several national inventories have estimated over \n8 million ha of bare land nationally and at least 700,000 ha of bare forestlands in the Central \nHighlands.  But  these  lands  remain  underutilized  because  of  uncertainty  over  use  rights. \nConsidering the poverty and underemployment in rural areas such as the Central Highlands, the \nunderutilization of bare forestlands represents a missed livelihood development opportunity. \n \n8.  Despite  the  introduction  of  new  land  allocation  policies  since  1993,  economically \ndisadvantaged ethnic minorities have limited influence on forestland allocation and management \ndecisions. High administrative fees for land certificates that document forest ownership and use \nrights further disadvantage the poor. Insufficient funds have been allocated and made available \nfor timely, equitable, and effective forestland classification and allocation. Tenure and access \ninsecurity  discourage  local  communities\u2019  taking  a  long-term  stake  in  sustainable  forest \nmanagement,  resulting  in  commune  and  village  forestlands  being  poorly  managed  and \nunderutilized. The consequences include (i) continuous forest encroachment and unsustainable \nharvesting, (ii) declining food and livelihood security for poor communities, and (iii) increased \nforestland conversion. \n ", "3 \n9.  More than 400 state forest enterprises (SFEs) control large areas (on average 20,000 to \n25,000 ha each) of primary forestland, which were allocated during the 1970s for logging to \nmeet growing post-war timber demand for reconstruction. Since the late 1990s, the harvesting \nquotas of SFEs have been sharply reduced because of concerns about forest degradation and \nworsening flood risks. As a result, many SFEs are no longer commercially viable but still control \nextensive forest areas. Over 100 SFEs with about 3,000 employees control over 1.4 million ha \nof natural forest. \n \n10.  Because of failures in forest classification and allocation, necessary financial and human \nresources  are  not  appropriately  allocated  and/or  utilized, causing  lost  output  potential  and \nexport earnings, reduced domestic supplies of wood products, and the sector\u2019s insignificant \ncontribution to poverty reduction. \n \n11.  Fragmented Institutions and Insufficient Human Resources. Responsibility for forest \nresource management, control, and monitoring has been delegated to provinces, districts, and \ncommunes. But insufficient funds have been allocated to the lower-level institutions to recruit, \ntrain, and retain the necessary staff. Institutional arrangements for provincial forest management \nare  fragmented,  despite  specific  regulations  on  who  can  and  should  do  what.  Provincial \nDepartment of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) and forestry staff responsible for \npolicy and technical matters have no administrative jurisdiction over forest managers (i.e., the \nSFEs), causing regulatory and technical oversight to break down. \n \n12.  Internal  coordination  is  weak  between  the  Ministry  of  Trade  and  Industry,  which  is \nresponsible  for  planning  and  promoting  wood-processing  industries,  and  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture and Rural Development (MARD), which is concerned with producing and supplying \nraw material. Similarly, insufficient coordination exists among departments that manage forestry, \nagriculture, and  water  resources,  so  that  each  sector  agency  strives  to  maximize  its  own \nbenefits without considering the physical and ecological limits to total resource use. \n \n13.  No well-trained, professional forestry cadre exists in provinces, allowing new entrants to \nenter at the district or commune level and climb to the provincial level. Recruitment of forestry \nstaff in provinces, districts, and communes does not tap into a national and provincial pool of \neducated and trained forestry graduates and technicians. Consequently, the skills for carrying \nout the required forest planning and management tasks are insufficient in provinces, districts, \nand communes. Staffing of the various technical entities in provinces and districts is insufficient \nto meet the extension needs and demands of the community. Staff of provincial, district, and \ncommune  institutions  are  not  adequately  trained  to  ensure  equity  for  women  and  ethnic \nminorities. \n \n14.  Insufficient Investments. The investment in maintaining economically important forest \nresources is only about 3% of the current value of sector output. The Government's investment \nin the sector is driven mainly by 5MHRP, which focuses on protected and special-use forests. \nProduction forests to supply raw materials for domestic and industrial use are expected to be \nfinanced by commercial funds. \n \n15.  Although Government policy includes promoting private sector investment in forestry, a \nconducive investment environment has not yet been created. Loans are available for forest \nplantations  and  wood  processing  at  concessionary  rates  (currently  6.24%)  from  the \nDevelopment Support Fund, but few enterprises can access it due to uncertainties over land \nholdings. The slow progress of land-use planning and allocation creates further uncertainty that \ndrives away potential investors, both domestic and foreign. \n \n ", "4 \n16.  Low Technical Knowledge, Information, and Skills Base. The two fundamental pre-\nconditions for sustainable forest management are that (i) the managed forest area be defined \nwith clear, long-term ownership and management regimes of 50\u2013100 years and (ii) harvesting \ndecisions and levels are based on sound growth and yield information. Since 1990, the Forest \nInventory and Planning Institute has established a network of around 4,000 sample plots, but \nbudgetary  and  technical  constraints  have  prevented  this  data  from  being  analyzed  and \npublished, making it unavailable to planners, managers, and investors. In addition, inadequate \ndata collection and analysis covers the processing industry, making it difficult to link forest \nmanagement regimes and production with specific market segments and end users. \n \n17.  Ethnic minorities, who reside mainly in upland areas, have traditionally practiced shifting \ncultivation,  which  became  unsustainable  as  the  population  grew  and  land-use  conditions \nchanged. But no sustenance or livelihood alternatives have been developed. Demonstrations of \nagroforestry  systems  suitable  for  replacing  shifting  cultivation  have  been  lacking.  Rural \ncommunities\u2019 lack of access to new, improved, and appropriate technologies, combined with \nundefined local resource governance regimes, have further contributed to their impoverishment, \nas well as to forest loss. These communities\u2019 skills and capacity need to be developed for \nsustainable forest management, community-participatory development, and integrated village \ndevelopment planning. \n \n2.  Lessons Learned \n18.  The Forestry Sector Project2 (FSP) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has faced \ndelays in implementation and low disbursements. This was expected to a certain extent, as it \nwas the first forestry loan project in the country and MARD had limited experience with the \nsector modality and its requirements. Other key lessons include the following: \n(i)  The assumption was misplaced that the Government had the budget and human \nresources  available  to  undertake  forestland-use  mapping  and  allocation \nnationwide and in the project area within the specified 2 years. \n(ii)  Participatory forestland-use and resource planning approaches and technologies \nwere not part of MARD\u2019s operational tool kit, so there were no cost norms or \nbudgetary  provisions  in  the  state  budget  for  these  activities.  Correcting  this \nproblem caused a 3-year delay in implementation. \n(iii)  Fund-flow  and  implementation  decision-making  has  to  be  decentralized,  and \nDARD\u2019s project accounting, financial management, and administrative capacity \nneed to be strengthened. \n(iv)  Efficient and effective input delivery and management considerations require that \nproject investments and activities not be sprinkled over a lot of noncontiguous \nprovinces. \n(v)  Small-scale forestry is not capital intensive but is labor intensive, which is why a \nloan of about $10 million under the Project could deliver the outputs and benefits \nthat were originally estimated to cost $33 million in loans. \n(vi)  Efficient and sustainable forestry depends on scale, requiring investments at the \ncommune, province, and watershed level to achieve the desired results. \n(vii)  Six years is too short for implementing forestry projects. \n \n19.  Other funding agencies\u2019 and stakeholders\u2019 experience indicates the following: \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 1997.

Opportunities \n20.  Clear  Sector  Development  Priorities  and  Policy  Directions.  The  Government\u2019s \nForest  Development  Strategy  (2001\u20132010)  and  sector  plans  call  for  making  forestry  an \nimportant economic sector by (i) protecting and developing forest resources and increasing \nforest cover from the current 32% to 43% by 2010, (ii) achieving an annual growth rate of over \n3.5% during 2006\u20132010, (iii) accelerating and completing forestland allocation under the Land \nLaw and the revised Forest Protection and Development Law, (iv) using forestry to improve \nlivelihoods and reduce poverty in chronically poor mountainous areas dominated by ethnic \nminorities; and (iv) increasing the efficiency and value of country\u2019s wood-processing industry. \n \n21.  5MHRP explicitly calls for (i) allocating forestland to organizations, households, and \nindividuals with emphasis on hunger elimination and poverty reduction; (ii) increasing people\u2019s \ninvolvement in forestry; (iii) expanding protected forests in important watersheds; (iv) promoting \nthe use of bare land for generating employment and reducing poverty; and (v) increasing the \nproductivity of natural forests and plantations to meet anticipated future demand for forest \nproducts. \n \n22.  The Government has a benefit-sharing policy in place that requires increasing benefits to \nhouseholds and individuals involved in forest protection, management, and reforestation. These \npolicies cover both allocated forestland and areas managed under contract by households or \nindividuals, including protected, special-use, and production forests. This creates an opportunity \nfor the expanded participation of communities and the non-state sector. \n \n23.  SFE restructuring requires SFEs that manage mainly production forests to operate as \nproductive business entities.3 This allows rationalizing and redefining the state\u2019s role in the \nforestry sector. It also removes a major barrier to private sector and community participation. \n \n24.  Forest lease laws allow forestland leasing of both protected forests for ecotourism and \nproduction forests to Vietnamese residing abroad, foreign organizations, and individuals. This \nprovides the right conditions for the participation of national private sector as well as foreign \ninvestors. \n \n                                                 \n3  Decision No. 187/1999/QD-TTg and Politburo Resolution No. 28QD/TW of June 2003 provide for renovation of \nSFEs. \n ", "6 \n25.  High Potential for Forestry and Poverty Reduction. The Central Highlands region is \ncurrently the most important in Viet Nam for forestry, with timber stock valued at about $4.4 \nbillion at current prices. It encloses about 30% of the country\u2019s forest area and supplies over \n60%  of  the  country\u2019s  annual  hardwood  consumption.  Ecological  conditions  in  the  Central \nHighlands are ideal for forestry. The terrain is generally easy, making commercial forestry \nfeasible and potentially efficient. Population densities are still low compared with other regions \nin Viet Nam. Currently, infrastructure is a constraint as major domestic and regional wood \nproduct markets are more than 200 kilometers (km) away. But roads are improving, and this \nshould improve market access.4 Moreover, existing processing capacity faces worsening raw \nmaterial shortages, which will raise market demand. \n \n26.  The Central Highlands have over 3 million ha of forest, but about half of it is seriously \ndegraded, requiring investments to restore its condition and productivity. Sound management of \nforests, including planting bare land with high-yielding native and exotic species, can meet over \n70% of Viet Nam\u2019s 2010\u20132015 domestic timber demand. Accordingly, the draft 2006\u20132010 \nsocioeconomic  development  plan  identifies  the  Central  Highlands  as  Government  priority \nregion, and forestry as a priority sector. It seeks to increase wood product exports from $1.5 \nbillion in 2005 to $3.5 billion in 2010. Central Highlands forests will have to make a major \ncontribution if these targets are to be achieved sustainably. \n \n27.  More than half of the 5 million people living in the Central Highlands are in the workforce, \nbut only about 11% are in wage-earning occupations, indicating high unemployment, particularly \nin the chronically poor ethnic minority communities. Most of the rural poor and unemployed live \nnear forests and have basic skills and knowledge relevant to forestry. Systematically and fully \nengaging these communities and the unemployed in the forest resource planning, management, \nproduction,  and  processing  provides  a  win-win  opportunity  for  sustainable  forestry  and \nlivelihoods. \n \n28.  The Government aims to reduce poverty from 52% in 2005 to about 38% by 2010. \nForestry is to play a major role in meeting this target by contributing to the regional GDP growth \nrate of 8\u20138.5%. Currently, SFEs and provincial management boards employ over 12,000 people \nincluding  contract  laborers.  Lower  forest  harvests  and  the  resulting  reduction  in  wood \nprocessing put their livelihood at risk. But, as they are skilled and semiskilled in some forestry \npractices, the Project can provide alternative job opportunities. \n \n29.  Increasing  Funding  Agency  Commitment  and  Emerging  Opportunities. \nGovernment and the Forest Sector Support Program and Partnership (FSSP) provide resources \nfor developing a sector-wide, programmatic approach to forest sector investments.5 The Trust \nFund for Forests (TFF), supported by FSSP, helps mobilize substantial grant financing for \ncapacity-building activities necessary to improve the management capacity and performance of \nthe sector. Carbon sequestration and trading under the clean development mechanism create \nadditional cash-transfer opportunities to communities living in or near forests. Furthermore, \naccessing the Global Environmental Facility-funded Viet Nam Conservation Fund will reduce the \nGovernment\u2019s  start-up  costs  for  protecting  regionally  and  globally  significant  biodiversity \nhotspots found in the Central Highlands. \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2002.

", "7 \n30.  Regional  Synergies  and  Cooperation.  The  Central  Highlands  forest  ecosystem \nstraddles the Cambodian and Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic border, providing watershed \nprotection to rivers draining into the Mekong and feeding into the Tonle Sap in Cambodia. \nMoreover, the conservation of these forests will be central to successfully implementing the \nGreater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  Biodiversity  Conservation  Corridors  Initiative  (BCI).6 \nCorrespondingly, GMS economic corridor development will increase the market catchment and \naccess for project products and services. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Approach, Impact, and Outcome \n31.  A participatory approach to diagnosis and design involving multiple stakeholders has \nbeen adopted for developing the project proposal.7 Project preparation identified the need for an \nintegrated approach to making the forestry sector market oriented. This is necessary if the \ncountry\u2019s goal of becoming a fully market-oriented and modern economy is to be achieved and \nthe  sector  is  to  (i)  meet  the  country\u2019s  growing  demand  for  wood  products  for  domestic \nconsumption  and  export,  (ii)  help  reduce  poverty  in  remote  areas,  and  (iii)  enhance  and \nmaintain  forestry-related  environmental  services.  To  achieve  these  sector  objectives  in  an \nenvironmentally  sound  and  socially  equitable  manner,  adopting  a  sector  modality  is  both \ndesirable and feasible. Because forestry investments have to be responsive simultaneously to \nthe needs of many stakeholders and to the socio-ecological conditions of specific locations, the \ntraditional blueprint approach to development and investment planning is inadequate to meet \nthe sector\u2019s many goals. \n \n32.  Furthermore, as summarized in paragraphs 20\u201324 and 28, Viet Nam has (i) a well-\ndefined forest sector strategy, development, and investment plan; (ii) the necessary policy and \nregulations in place; and (iii) the necessary institutional capacity to implement a sector loan. \nAccordingly, based on the analysis of the key challenges affecting sector performance, lessons \nlearned, and opportunities identified, the Project takes a program and geographic slice of the \ncountry\u2019s forest sector development plan as encapsulated in the Forest Development Strategy \n(2001\u20132010) and FSSP. \n \n33.  Investment packages and project interventions and implementation arrangements have \nbeen developed using a participatory planning approach. The sample core subproject of Lam \nDong  and  the  seven  sample  communes  were  developed  using  this  approach.  A  similar \napproach will be used in designing and implementing the remaining five subprojects and 53 \ncommune  investment  plans  (CIPs).  Over  8  years,  project  implementation  will  cover  six \nprovinces (subprojects) in the Central Highlands involving over 60 communes. Province and \ncommune  selection  criteria  require  that  they  (i)  have  rich  forests  with  significant  but \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2004.

Total TA amount is $1.56 million, of which $800,000 is from TA \nfunds and $760,000 is funded by the Government of the Netherlands. TA reviewed and analyzed sector strategies, \npolicies, regulations, institutions, and technical issues in the FSSP framework. The outputs of these analyses have \ninformed  the  Government\u2019s  revision  of  the  2001\u20132010  Forest  Sector  Strategy,  2006\u20132010  forest  sector \ndevelopment plan, and formulation of this project proposal. This analysis has been complemented by the findings \nof ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Study on the Policy and \nInstitutional Framework for Forest Management.

The  type  and  scale  of  forestry \ninterventions in each of the subprojects are similar and so are expected to replicate the financial \nand economic viability of the sample Lam Dong subproject. The Project will be implemented by \nprovinces in collaboration with project area households, communities, and forestry teaching and \ntraining institutions. \n \n34.  The Project proposes an investment package with the primary purpose of increasing the \nforest capital of the county and improving its developmental and poverty-reduction performance. \nIt includes investments in areas that are critical for transforming the sector, i.e., business capital, \nhuman  capital,  forestry-related  rural  infrastructure,  knowledge  capital,  and  stakeholder \ninstitutional capacity.8 The Project will contribute to the Viet Nam Development Goals (VDGs, \nare national level equivalent of the Millennium Development Goals) of poverty reduction and \nenvironmental protection by accelerating the market-orientation of the country\u2019s forestry sector.9 \nIt will do so by (i) improving the condition and value of Central Highlands forests, (ii) eliminating \nhunger and halving poverty among 80,000 of the country\u2019s poorest households living in or near \nthese forests, (iii) improving the protection of globally significant biodiversity, (iv) enhancing the \nprotection and performance of critical watersheds, and (v) attracting investors to invest in the \nsector. The specific outcome of the Project is to enable the Government to bring over one-third \nof  country\u2019s  poorly  and  mismanaged  natural  forest  estates  under  sustainable  forest \nmanagement and secure over 70% of national timber needs in 2010\u20132015. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n35.  The Project consists of four components: (i) sustainable forest resource management \nand  development,  (ii)  livelihood  improvement,  (iii)  capacity  development,  and  (iv)  project \nmanagement and implementation. Sustainable forest resource development and management \ninvestments focus on provinces and communes; livelihood improvement forestry investments on \nover  60  selected  communes;  business  and  capacity  development  investments  on  relevant \nstakeholders such as state agencies, communities and communes, and small and medium \nenterprises  (SMEs)  and  entrepreneurs;  and  project  management  and  capacity-building \ninvestments on provinces, districts and communes to ensure timely delivery of funds, inputs and \noutputs. \n \n1.  Sustainable Forest Resource Management and Development \n36.  Forest Land Management Planning. The main purpose of this investment is to secure \nover $4.4 billion worth of forest and timber assets and future benefits by clarifying, establishing, \nand protecting forestland property and the use rights of the state, households, communities, and \nother stakeholders. Building on completed land-use maps prepared by the Ministry of Natural \nResources  and  Environment,  and  using  a  participatory  approach  involving  multiple \nstakeholders, the Project will support upgrading strategies for provincial land and forestland use \nin accordance with the new Land and Forest Protection laws. This will include rationalizing \nforest management objectives and regimes in provinces, districts, and communes. It will provide \nthe enabling governance and incentive framework for accelerated and equitable forestland \nallocation, restructuring of SFEs, and multi-stakeholder and multiple-use sustainable natural \n                                                 \n8  This is consistent with the six capital bundles of a well-functioning economy or sector and, thereby, for sound \neconomic and sector development investments (Jeffrey Sachs. 2005.

Six  provincial  sustainable  forest \nmanagement plans will be prepared and, once approved by the provincial people\u2019s committees, \nwill become the business plans for the forestry sectors in project provinces. \n \n37.  Involving over 3 million ha of production forests, the Project will support the following \nactivities under this component: \n(i)  forest  zoning  and  identifying  production  clusters,  for  which  the  Project  will \nsupport forest resource management planning and zoning based on geographic \ninformation systems (GIS) in provinces, districts, and communes; \n(ii)  forest  delineation,  surveying,  and  demarcation  for  clearly  and  permanently \ndefining forest boundaries, irrespective of land ownership and/or management \nregimes; and \n(iii)  forest inventory and management planning, for which the Project will support the \npreparation  of  detailed  forest  management  plans  for  over  3  million  ha  in \nconsultation  with  participating  stakeholders.  This  will  minimize  conflicts  over \nforestland use and management and achieve economies of scale in terms of \nproject management, production, and marketing. \n \n38.  Forest Resource Development. The purpose of these investments is to improve the \nmanagement of existing commune and village forests, and bring underutilized bare land under \nhigh-yielding productive plantations of native and/or exotic species. The Project will support \nforest management improvements such as enrichment planting and improved protection for \nforest  resources  under  village  and/or  community  ownership  in  60  selected  communes. \nInvestments will aim to increase the extent of plantation forests and improve their condition and \nproductivity. Involving over 80,000 households, this will bring over 144,000 ha of commune and \nvillage forests under sustainable forestry, including over 30,000 ha of livelihood plantations \nestablished on bare lands. Given the low creditworthiness and lack of access to affordable \nfinancing  in  the  project  area,  the  costs  and  benefits  of  the  investments  will  be  shared  in \naccordance with the equity models identified and developed during project preparation. \n \n39.  In addition to defining and delineating protected and special-use forests, the Project will \nfacilitate the conservation of three high-priority global biodiversity areas covering over 87,000 ha \nunder  the  Viet  Nam  Conservation  Fund  and  the  GMS  BCI.  Project  activities  will  include \nparticipatory biodiversity assessments and monitoring. This will provide increased wage-earning \nopportunities for the local communities and, at the same time, improve their development skills \nin numeracy and community organization. \n \n40.  Business Development. The Project will support business development opportunities \nfor  such  entities  as  SMEs  and  reformed  and  restructured  SFEs.  This  will  improve  forest \nresource use and processing efficiencies, strengthen supply and markets chains, and add value \nto forest-based goods and services. The Project will provide support to at least three SFEs \nundergoing restructuring within the overall framework of public sector and state enterprise \nreform. The Project will support market diversification by helping to establish at least 20 new \nSMEs and providing marketing support to about 75 community groups and over 40 existing \nSMEs. It will support piloting of modern, efficient woody biomass\u2013conversion technologies to \nincrease  the  efficiency  of  using  wood  as  fuel  in  project  communes.  To  capture  emerging \nresource  mobilization  and  marketing  opportunities,  the  Project  will  support  pilot  measures \npromoting  clean  development  mechanisms  and  technologies  that  contribute  to  innovative \nfinancing for forest ecosystem conservation and services. \n \n ", "10 \n2.  Livelihood Improvement \n41.  The Project will support livelihood improvement and income generation in 60 of the \ncountry\u2019s poorest communes by establishing commune development funds (CDFs). Using an \nequity model, 70% of the income from household and commune forestry activities will go to the \nparticipating households and 30% to the revolving fund established under each CDF. CDFs will \ngive priority, but will not be restricted, to forestry-related income-generating and livelihood-\nimprovement  investments  in  communes  and  villages.  Support  for  small-scale  infrastructure \nimprovement will include constructing and upgrading health posts, class rooms, drinking wells, \nsmall  irrigation  systems,  inter-village  and  commune  access  roads,  and  commune  cultural \nhouses.  These  investments  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  the  CIPs.10  Over  80,000 \nhouseholds, and over 144,000 ha of village and commune forests, will benefit from these \ninterventions. CDFs will use a bottom-up participatory planning approach to allow communes \nand communities to determine project investment priorities and activities. Reinvesting 30% of \nrevenues in the CDF will contribute to making Project investments financially self-sustaining and \nreduce  dependence  on  external  sources.  CDF  management  will  also  empower  local \ncommunities,  including  ethnic  minorities  and  women,  by  increasing  their  capacity  and \nopportunity to participate in decision making. In addition to these commune-based activities, the \nProject  will  actively  involve  local  communities  in  forest  demarcation,  inventorying,  and \nmonitoring. These activities will provide additional opportunities for income generation in local \ncommunities in the early stages of project implementation. \n3.  Capacity Development \n42.  The  objective  is  to  build  the  relevant  stakeholders\u2019  technical,  management,  and \nmonitoring capacity at central, provincial, district, and commune levels. This will catalyze the \ntransition of the state-dominated forest management regime toward a non-state and market-\nfriendly  one.  The  Project  will  support  strengthening  (i)  forest  planning  and  management \ndecision-support systems, (ii) collaborative and community-based forest resource development \nand management, (iii) decentralized financial and administrative decision making and project \nimplementation, (iv) effective extension delivery, and (v) institutional capacity in communes and \ndistricts. Key interventions include training staff, providing equipment to provide extension, and \nenterprise support services to communities, households, and SMEs. Particular emphasis will be \nplaced  on  strengthening  capacity  in  communes,  especially  of  ethnic  minority  groups,  to \nadminister and manage a CDF. The Project will support and facilitate upgrading teaching staff at \ntwo forestry institutions responsible for educating and training foresters and forestry technicians. \nIt will also support training and upgrading the skills of over 550 professional staff and about \n1,000 technicians. \n \n4.  Project Management and Implementation \n43.  The Project will strengthen MARD\u2019s project management and implementation capacity \ncentrally and provincially, financing the necessary office equipment and supplies for project \nimplementation. To overcome Government staff constraints without increasing the long-term \nbudgetary  burden  on  the  Government,  the  Project  will  contract  administrative  and  support \npersonnel for efficient and effective implementation and monitoring of project activities. Under \nTA, a consulting firm will be contracted to help MARD implement the Project, in particular \npreparing a forest resource management plan, decentralizing commune investment planning \n                                                 \n10 CIPs were prepared for seven sample communes spread over the six provinces, and these provide the template for \nscaling up and replication in the remaining 53 communes.

Project  activities  and  commune  clustering  will  (i)  maximize  synergies \nbetween  sustainable  forestry  and  livelihood  improvement  for  poverty  reduction,  especially \namong ethnic minority communities; (ii) facilitate the efficient delivery of material and extension \ninputs and project supervision; and (iii) achieve critical production thresholds to catalyze the \ndevelopment of market chains and enterprises. \n \n45.  Collaborative  Resource  Management  and  Decentralized  Implementation.  The \ninvolvement of primary stakeholders and other non-state actors in forest management and \nProject  implementation  will  help  overcome  the  Government\u2019s  human  resource  capacity \nconstraints, improve transparency, and empower rural communities. In accordance with the \nGovernment\u2019s decentralization policies, the 5-year commune investment plans will be approved \nby provincial people\u2019s committees, but yearly investment plans and budgets will be approved by \ndistrict people\u2019s committees. Commune people\u2019s councils will approve investments of up to D1 \nbillion.11 \n \n46.  Performance-Based Allocation. Project fund allocation will be based on the timely and \nefficient utilization of funds and disbursements by project provinces. Consistent with the sector \nmodality, the provincial and physical targets are indicative. Provincial fund allocation will be \nadjusted in project years 2, 4, and 6 to take into account fund utilization and disbursements by \nproject provinces. Funds from underperforming components and/or provinces will be reallocated \nto better-performing components and/or provinces. \n \n47.  GIS-Based Landscape Approach. Consistent with state-of-the-art conservation and \nforestry practices, the Project uses the landscape approach and GIS technology for planning, \nimplementation, and monitoring impact. \n \n48.  Regional  Cooperation  and  Emerging  Resource  Mobilization  Opportunities:  The \nProject  will  strengthen  Viet  Nam\u2019s  contribution  to  regional  cooperation  in  environmental \nmanagement by improving the protection of critical watersheds and biodiversity of importance to \nneighboring countries such as Cambodia and the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and to the \nlarger  global  community.  It  will  maximize  synergies  with  the  GMS  economic  cooperation \nprogram  and  BCI.  It  will  help  Viet  Nam\u2019s  forestry  sector  attract  substantial  foreign  direct \ninvestment and capture the new funding opportunities from carbon trading and ecotourism.  \nD.  Cost Estimates \n49.  The estimated project cost is $90.66 million equivalent, including physical and price \ncontingencies, taxes and duties, and interest during implementation. Component-specific cost \nestimates are in Table 2, and the detailed project cost estimate is presented in Appendix 4. \n \n                                                 \n11 Existing Department of Finance guidelines for decentralizing budget management will be adopted for project \nimplementation. Administrative and financial management arrangements are to ensure that disbursement is done \nwithin 30 days of completing work under the Project. The Project will undertake capacity building and provide \ntechnical assistance to provinces, districts, and communes to support this objective. \n ", "12 \nTable 2: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n \nItem    Amountsa \nA.

The Government has requested a loan of $45 million equivalent from ADB's Special \nFunds resources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a \ngrace period of 8 years and an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter. The Government will provide counterpart funds of $18.29 million \nequivalent for taxes, recurrent costs, and part of the capital cost.

", "13 \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n51.  MARD will be the Executing Agency. The central project management unit (CPMU), \nheaded by a project director, will be responsible for coordinating, monitoring, and providing \nquality control and advisory services to provinces during implementation. The CPMU will be \nresponsible for procuring all major equipment and distributing it to implementing agencies. \nProvincial project management units (PPMU) under the provincial DARD will be responsible for \nproject implementation in the provinces. Facilitated and supported by the CPMU and PPMUs, \nMARD and provincial authorities will meet at least twice in a year to jointly review and endorse \nthe project annual plan of operations. The central Project Steering Committee (CPSC) will be \nestablished by MARD. The CPSC will be headed by a Vice-Minister of MARD and will have \nrepresentatives from concerned agencies from concerned agencies and provinces. The CPSC \nwill be responsible for providing guidance and Project oversight to ensure objectives of the \nProject as outlined in this Loan Agreement are achieved. Provincial steering committee (PPSC) \nheaded by the leader of the relevant people's provincial committee leader will be established to \noversee Project implementation at the provincial level. \n \n2.  Implementation Schedule \n52.  The Project will be implemented over 8 years from October 2006 to 31 December 2014. \nProject activities are sequenced across provinces and in communes in accordance with project \nplanning and the implementation capacity of Government staff and local communities. Starting \nin project year 1, CIPs will be prepared on a rolling basis with funds flowing within 3 months of \nplanning phase completion and as approved by appropriate provincial authorities. Procuring \nmajor equipment will take place in the first year. The implementation schedule, outlining the \npreparation and implementation of six provincial forest management plans and CIPs, is in \nAppendix 5. \n \n3.  Procurement \n53.  ADB  has  approved  advance  action  for  procurement  of  goods  and  recruitment  of \nconsultants. MARD will take advance procurement action to expedite Project implementation \nparticularly office equipment and supplies for the CPMU. All supplies, equipment and services \nfinanced from the ADB loan, technical assistance and ADB-administered grants will be procured \nin  accordance  with  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines.  Goods,  works,  and  materials  will  be \nprocured through international competitive bidding where the cost is valued at more than $1 \nmillion equivalent, or by national competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB, where the \ncost is valued below $1,000,000 equivalent. Goods and materials valued at less than $1 million \nand $10,000 equivalent will be procured through shopping and direct contracting respectively. \nThe Government has been advised that approval of such advance action does not commit ADB \nto finance any part of the Project. The procurement plan is outlined in Appendix 6. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n54.  The Project will require 153 person-months  of international consulting services and \n4,948 person-months of national consulting services. In addition, staff will be contracted as \nneeded  to  develop  commune  capacity  for  sustainable  forest  management  and  livelihood \ndiversification.  This level  of  input is  necessary  to  efficiently  and  effectively  shift  the  state-\ndominated forest sector (over a third of the country\u2019s natural forest estate) toward non-state \nmanagement. Under TA, international and national consultants will be recruited in a single \n ", "14 \npackage from a consulting firm, using ADB quality- and cost-based selection through a full \ntechnical proposal in accordance with ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Contracted \nstaff and/or NGOs with relevant experience will be recruited by MARD in consultation with ADB \nand  in  a  manner  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  national  staff  recruitment.  Appendix  7 \nsummarizes consulting services. \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n55.  The CPMU will use ADB imprest account procedures for eligible project expenditures. \nAn  imprest  account  for  the  loan  will  be  established  by  the  CPMU  at  a  commercial  bank \nacceptable to ADB within 1 month of loan effectiveness. The account will have a ceiling of $2.5 \nmillion; the initial deposit will be based on estimated expenditures for the first 6 months of \nproject  implementation  or  $2.5  million,  whichever  is  lower.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be \nestablished,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook, as amended from time to time, and detailed arrangements agreed by \nthe Government and ADB. Statement-of-expenditure procedures will be used for reimbursing \neligible expenditures and liquidating advances to the imprest accounts to ensure speedy project \nimplementation. The maximum payment for any individual item using statement of expenditure \nis $100,000. \n \n56.  To  expedite  fund  flows  to  the  provinces  and  national  institutes,  each  province  will \nestablish a second-generation imprest account (SGIA) if necessary for the grant proceeds or \nlocal equivalent for the loan proceeds, at commercial banks acceptable to ADB. The CPMU will \ntransfer  funds  from  the  imprest  accounts  to  the  SGIAs  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements agreed by the Government and ADB. The \ninitial amount to be deposited into each of the SGIAs will not exceed the equivalent of 6 months\u2019 \nestimated expenditures or $250,000, whichever is lower. The ceiling for SGIAs will not exceed \n$250,000. Project financial management and supporting documents will be in accordance with \narrangements acceptable to ADB. \n \n6.  Financial Management, Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n57.  Financial  Management.  MARD  is  currently  implementing  five  ADB  loan  projects, \nincluding the FSP. It has implemented forestry loan and grant projects funded by the World \nBank and other development partners amounting to over $380 million and demonstrated the \nfinancial-management capacity necessary to manage a large, externally financed project. It has \nmaintained  a  number  of  first  and  second  generation  imprest  accounts  and  has  submitted \nrequired audits in a timely fashion. Based on the experience of ADB and others with MARD, the \nfinancial management arrangements are appropriate. \n \n58.  Accounts  and  Auditing.  The  Government  will,  through  MARD,  maintain  adequate \nrecords and accounts to identify goods and services financed by the Project. The CPMU will \n(i) keep project accounts separate from regular accounts; (ii) maintain separate accounts for the \nloan and grant portions of the Project; (iii) ensure accounts and financial statements are audited \nannually  in  a  timely  fashion,  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles,  by  external \nauditors acceptable to ADB; and (iv) submit to ADB, not later than 6 months after the close of \neach fiscal year, certified copies of audited project accounts (including the imprest accounts, \nstatements of expenditure, and financial statements), the auditor\u2019s reports and opinions, and the ", "15 \nmanagement letter, together with a report of actions taken by MARD to improve the financial \nmanagement system. The Project will finance the cost of auditing.12 \n \n59.  Anticorruption.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with \nMARD. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt, \nfraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the \nbidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with \nthe Project will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records \nand accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other \nservice providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n7.  Reporting \n60.  After  the  Project  becomes  effective,  MARD  will  prepare  quarterly  progress  reports \nsummarizing  (i)  progress  made  against  established  targets,  (ii)  delays  and  problems \nencountered and actions taken to resolve issues, (iii) compliance with loan assurances and \ncovenants, (iv) a proposed program of activities to be undertaken during the next 6 months, \n(v) expected  progress  during  the  succeeding  period,  and  (vi)  the  status  of  participating \nprovinces  and  institutions.  Within  3  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  Project,  the \nGovernment will prepare and submit a project completion report to ADB. \n \n8.  Project Review \n61.  The Government and ADB will conduct reviews of the Project at least twice a year to \nensure smooth implementation. The Government and ADB will jointly undertake a midterm \nreview after 3 years of physical implementation. The midterm review will (i) review the Project\u2019s \nscope, design, implementation arrangements, and other relevant issues; (ii) examine progress \ntoward the Project\u2019s objectives and output; (iii) assess implementation performance against \nprojections and identify changing needs for resource allocation; (iv) review compliance with loan \ncovenants;  (v)  identify  problems  and  constraints;  and  (vi)  formulate  appropriate \nrecommendations for corrective action. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring, Evaluation, and Sustainability \n62.  One of the major objectives of the Project is to improve the productivity of forest sector in \nthe Central Highlands and its contribution to poverty reduction. MARD and ADB have identified \na shortlist of verifiable indicators for monitoring and evaluation that are incorporated in the \ndesign and monitoring framework (Appendix 3). In addition, the Project will promote beneficiary-\nbased impact-monitoring regimes  developed under the ongoing FSP. Putting in place and \nstrengthening a decentralized forest-resource and financial-management regime is necessary to \nensure  the  post-project  sustainability  of  assets  created  by  the  Project.  CDFs  will  play  an \nimportant role in ensuring that sufficient operational budgets are available for this purpose. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n63.  Advisory TA is required to provide the Government with technical and advisory support \nfor extending the proposed sustainable resource development and management in the forest \n                                                 \n12 ADB.

TA will cover five main areas by providing (i) international and national expertise, and \nfixed-term  contracted  staff,  to  strengthen  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  for  forest  inventory, \nassessment, valuation, and sound financial management; (ii) advisory support on sustainable \nforest resource development in the 60 communes in the Project area, including strengthening \ntheir capacity to handle development funds and stage community and social development \nactivities;  (iii)  support  for  strengthening  the  management  and  maintenance  of  small-scale \ninfrastructure development for income-generating activities, as well as two forestry education \nand  training  institutions;  (iv)  support  for  coordinating  capacity  development  in  communes, \ndistricts, provinces, and the national Government; and (v) support for compliance with the \nGovernment\u2019s and ADB\u2019s ethnic minority, gender, and environmental polices. The total cost of \nTA is estimated at $7.82 million equivalent, with cofinancing of $7.57 million from TFF and the \nremaining $0.25 million from ADB.13 TA objectives, scope, cost, financing, and outline terms of \nreference are in Appendix 7. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefits \n65.  Pro-Poor and Market-Friendly Sector Governance. The Project will address (i) the \nabsence of technically sound and socioeconomically responsive forest management plans and \n(ii)  institutional,  management,  and  market  failures  that  constrain  the  full  and  effective \nparticipation of the private sector, both formal and informal, in forestry. Removing these barriers \nwill facilitate mobilizing much-needed human and financial resources from non-state sectors. It \nwill  also  increase  the  efficiency  of  public  sector  forestry  investments,  which  so  far  have \nunderperformed because of insufficient forest planning and management capacity. The Project \nwill help secure over 3 million ha of natural forests with a current value of $4.4 billion and bring \nmanagement of over 1.5 million ha of natural production forests in line with international market \nrequirements and certification standards. Timber asset value is expected to increase to $6.4 \nbillion over the project life of 40 years, instead of reducing to $2.8 billion, as it would without the \nProject. Stakeholder-specific cost- and benefit-sharing options and arrangements have been \nidentified to ensure the efficient use of project funds and equitable sharing of project benefits. \nThis will improve governance and the transparency of financial transactions. \n \n66.  Improved Sector Performance and Competitiveness. By allocating long-term, secure \nownership or usufruct rights, providing forest-management and agroforestry-extension advice \nand financial support, and developing appropriate infrastructure, the Project will encourage \nprivate sector investment in a range of new or restructured and diversified enterprises for \nproduction and the effective utilization of forest resources. It will also strengthen forest sector \ninstitutions to enable them to provide long-term forest management capacity building to both \nstate  and  private  enterprises.  The  focus  on  strengthening  private  sector  production  and \nmarketing mechanisms will increasingly meet domestic and international market demand for \nsustainably  harvested  domestic  forest  resources,  thereby  curtailing  illegal  logging  and \nexpensive imports. \n \n67.  Improved Livelihoods and Reduced Poverty. Allocating land to individual farmers and \nhouseholds has significantly contributed to Viet Nam\u2019s transition from rice deficits to the second \n                                                 \n13 TFF was established in December 2003. The governments of Finland, Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland are \nthe main contributors to the fund. ", "17 \nlargest volume of rice exports in the world. The Project will facilitate a similar transformation of \ncountry\u2019s forest sector, especially in the Central Highlands. Less than 1% of forestland has been \nallocated so far to households and communities. The principal social benefit from the Project will \nbe the provision of clear forestland-use rights to households and communities through the \nallocation of forestland, and the resulting security will encourage them to invest in and manage \nforest production and protection sustainably and profitably. More direct, quantifiable benefits will \nderive from employment generation by households, communities, and enterprises. The Project \nwill have a significant impact by providing opportunities for long-term employment either through \nowner-operated forest production or employment in forest-based enterprises. Project forest \nplanning and management activities will directly create at least 23 million person-days of wage-\ngenerating opportunities for semiskilled and underemployed rural residents. Under the equity-\nsharing models for household forestry, in the first year of implementation, the Project will ensure \nat  least  $110  in  additional  income  to  households.  This  additional  cash  income  will  allow \nhouseholds to overcome 3\u20135 month food deficits and eliminate hunger. In addition to cash \nincome from labor wages during the first 6 years, households will realize a revenue share of \nabout $1,100/ha in year 8. \n \n68.  Enhanced Social and Gender Equity. The equitable allocation of land and clear rights \nover its use will help ethnic minorities in the project area participate effectively in forest-based \neconomic  activities  and  reduce  income  disparities.  Poor  households  will  acquire  economic \nopportunities  other  than  shifting  cultivation,  thereby  reducing  forest  loss.  The  Project  will \npromote the participation of women in forest production and management through focused \ncapacity building and training. For this purpose, the Project will seek to recruit one female staff \nmember  in  each  provincial  project  implementation  office  in  one  of  three  key  areas  of \nspecialization: forestry, farming systems, and community development. \n \n69.  Increased  Revenue  Generation,  Natural  Forest  Assets  and  Value,  and  Wood \nProduction. In the scenario without the Project, the total growing stock in the natural production \nforests of the Central Highlands is expected to decline from the present 100 million m3 to about \n75 million m3 by 2045. With the Project, the estimate is about 135 million m3. Thus the total \ngrowing stock is expected to be 60 million m3 higher 40 years from now as a result of the \nProject. With a project investment of about $12 million for improving natural forest management \nand $60 million in maintenance costs over 40 years, the asset value is expected to increase to \n$6.4 billion. Under the proposed management, over 40 years the natural forest area has the \npotential to generate incremental wood yield valued at $44 million (net present value at 10% \ndiscount rate). At full development, the Project\u2019s livelihood plantations will have an annual \nproduction value of over $3.6 million. Annual Government revenues from natural resource taxes \non livelihood plantations and natural forest management alone are expected to average $1.86 \nmillion  in  2006\u20132010  and  about  $2  million  in  2011\u20132015.  This  revenue  will  increase \nsubstantially if the envisaged private sector investments are realized. The revenue-generating \ncomponents described above do not include the value of biodiversity conservation or watershed \nservices the forests provide. A financial evaluation of candidate revenue-generating investments \nfor the sample subproject was undertaken in real terms, using constant 2005 prices. The \nfinancial analyses of selected plantation models indicate a financial internal rate of return (FIRR) \nof 12\u201317%, whereas longer rotations of 15\u201340 years have FIRRs of 9\u201315%. Sensitivity analysis \nwas carried out for a combination of yield classes (12, 16, and 20 m3/ha/year), daily wage rates \n(D35,000, D30,000, and D25,000), and distance to market (50, 100, 150 km). The financial \nrates of return for 50 and 100 km vary from 13% to 27%. For more than 150 km and a daily \nwage rate of D35,000, it varies from 1% for yield class 12 to 8.2% for yield class 20, indicating \nthat returns are most sensitive to distance to market. These rates of return compare favorably \nwith the weighted average cost of project capital. \n \n ", "18 \n70.  Combining Environmental Protection and Poverty Reduction. The sector's ability to \nachieve the national goal of placing 43% of its land area under forest cover, and of protecting \nthe environment and maintaining habitats, is clearly under serious threat despite the recorded \nincrease in forest area through reforestation. Delineating and demarcating the remaining natural \nforest areas into special-use, protected, and production management blocks or zones, with \nclearly  defined  management  roles  and  responsibilities,  will  strongly  help  stem  habitat \ndegradation. The Project will specifically address biodiversity conservation by supporting the \nprotection of over 99,000 ha of natural forest and facilitating improved management of over \n87,000 ha of globally significant biodiversity area. In addition to providing sustainable supplies of \nnon-wood forest products, these activities will increase opportunities for the local poor to earn \nwages and develop social capital. \n \nB.  Risks \n1.  Institutional, Economic, and Environmental Risks \n71.  The Project will support interventions and technologies well established in Viet Nam\u2019s \nforestry sector, with  minimal technical risks. Project interventions will secure and enhance \nindigenous people\u2019s access to forest resources without causing any involuntary restrictions on \nland use or access to resources. \n \n72.  SFE reform is central to rationalizing roles, responsibilities, and investments in using \nforestlands. Failed SFE restructuring would put at risk the potential for attracting private sector \ninvestments and community support and participation. The following measures will mitigate this \nrisk: (i) a specific assurance from the Government to implement SOE reform decrees; (ii) \nprovision by the Project of incentives to restructured SFE employees, including training; and (iii) \nthe coordination with FSSP partners and through SOE and/or SFE reform performance trigger \nin the poverty reduction support credits to leverage support. \n \n73.  A demand-driven, market-oriented approach to forest sector management is new to Viet \nNam and risks undue government interference. The demand-driven aspect will, however, be \nfacilitated by the Project\u2019s emphasis on participatory management, which will be the focus of \ncapacity  building,  training,  and  awareness-building  consultations  and  workshops.  These \nactivities  will  contribute  to  the  growth  of  forest  and  agroforestry  SMEs  and  the  long-term \nsustainability of project outcomes. \n \n74.  Business  or  technical  risks  exist  if  householders  and  enterprises  do  not  attain  the \nrequired  skills  to  achieve  the  returns  expected  from  improved  forest  utilization  and \nmanagement. The Project\u2019s investment in long-term capacity building in the forest sector will \nhelp to mitigate this risk. \n \n75.  Failure to provide adequate income-earning opportunities to absorb labor affected by the \nrestructuring of SFEs may increase poverty and illegal felling in the project area. To mitigate this \nrisk, SFE restructuring will include retraining for job opportunities created by increased forestry \nand processing activities in the non-state sector. \n \n76.  A risk exists that worsening supply deficits and poverty will increase illegal logging, \nmaking sustainable forest management less attractive and profitable in the short run. This risk \nwill be managed by increasing the access and stake of households, communities, and the state \nsector in the forests, so that they see the long-term benefits of sustainable forestry. The Project \nwill  also  involve  the  Ministry  of  Industry  in  sector  discussions  so  that  developing  forest \nprocessing enterprises stays in line with supplies of raw materials. ", "19 \n77.  Potential  environmental  risks  include  (i)  soil  erosion  during  forest  harvesting  and \nplanting, (ii) water contamination from fertilizer and pesticide use, (iii) the use of lands suitable \nfor natural forests for plantations, and (iv) minor impacts from constructing village infrastructure. \nThe Project recommends the necessary mitigation measures together with specific staff and \nbudgetary resources for implementing internationally recognized, sustainable forestry and risk \nmanagement  regimes  to  avoid  or  minimize  these  impacts.  Environmental  assessment  and \nreview  procedures  have  been  prepared  to  ensure  environmental  compliance  in  subproject \nselection. A sector environmental analysis was carried out, and the findings suggest that long-\nterm and cumulative impacts are largely beneficial. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n78.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  MARD  will  give  the \nfollowing assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n(i)  Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, MARD will approve a detailed project \nimplementation  manual  with  clear  definitions  of  roles  and  responsibilities  of \ndifferent line agencies and stakeholders and guidelines on technical, operational, \nand financial administration and management of the Project. \n(ii)  The central and provincial authorities will ensure to make timely requests for \ncounterpart funds to be appropriated in the central and provincial budget for \nactivities for the first and subsequent project years. \n(iii)  By  30  June  2008,  harvesting  and  transit  rules  governing  wood  and  wood \nproducts as stipulated in Decision No. 40/2005/QD-BNN dated 7 July 2005 will \nbe reviewed and if necessary revised to ensure unhindered access to markets for \nwood  and  wood  products  harvested  by  villages  and  communes  under  the \napproved management plans set up under the Project. \n(iv)  By 31 December 2008, provincial timber harvesting quotas and harvesting plans \nwill  be  based  on  the  results  of  the  forestry  inventory  and  growth  and  yield \nassessments carried out under the Project. \n(v)  By 31 December 2008, SFE's role and functions in the project provinces will be \nbrought  in  line  with  the  sustainable  forest  management  administrative  and \nmanagement regimes developed by the Project. \n(vi)  By 30 June 2009, MARD and project provincial authorities will approve SFE's \nplans and submit respective proposals to the Government requesting permission \nto implement these plans. \n(vii)  The Government will ensure that adequate budget will be made available on an \nannual basis to the project provinces for the operation and maintenance of the \nproject facilities and government-employed staff at the provincial, district, and \ncommune level. \n(viii)  The Government, through MARD, will ensure that project activities comply with \napplicable laws and regulations of Viet Nam; ADB environment policies and \nregulations,  specifically  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002);  environment \nassessment  and  review  procedures,  the  summary  initial  environmental \nexamination; and environmental monitoring plan as set out in the summary initial \nenvironmental examination for preparing initial environmental examination for the \nremaining project provinces. \n(ix)  The Government will ensure the implementation of the livelihood improvement \nand ethnic minority development plan prepared for the Project in accordance with \napplicable government policies and procedures and ADB policies, specifically \n ", "20 \nADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998).  This  includes  ensuring  equal \nopportunities for ethnic minority communities and staff in training, and integrating \ncultural sensitivities in project implementation. \n(x)  In the unforeseen event of involuntary resettlement as defined by ADB\u2019s policy \non involuntary resettlement, MARD will inform ADB and, prior to proceeding with \nthe particular activity, prepare resettlement planning documents for review and \napproval by ADB. \n(xi)  The Government will ensure that the Project\u2019s gender action plan is implemented \nand that equal access to project and training opportunities are provided for men \nand women. Women will make up at least a quarter of commune-level project \nstaff. Forestland allocation certificates will be for women and men with joint titles \nas per the Land Law of 2003. \n(xii)  The Government will ensure that forestland tenure rights are consistent with \nforest and plantation harvesting cycles to ensure project primary stakeholders \nrights to harvest wood and non-wood forest products at maturity. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n79.  The following are specified as additional conditions to the effectiveness of this Loan \nAgreement for the purposes of Section 9.01(f) of the Loan Regulations: (i) MARD and relevant \nGovernment  authorities  will  have  issued  decisions  providing  clear  guidelines  for  Project \nimplementation and financial allocations; (ii) the Borrower will have established the CPMU and \nPPMUs in a manner satisfactory to ADB, with necessary staffing including full time qualified \naccountants; and (iii) the Borrower will have received the confirmation of the Trust Fund for \nForests that the TFF Grant will be made available for the purpose of the Project. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n80.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n(i)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 30,486,000 to \nthe Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Forests for Livelihood Improvement in \nthe Central Highlands Sector Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with \nan interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and \nsuch other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board; \n(ii)  the administration by ADB of grant not exceeding the equivalent of $8,000,000 to \nthe Socialist Republic of Viet Nam to be provided by the Trust Fund for Forests; \n(iii)  the administration by ADB of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent \nof $7,570,000 to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Forests for Livelihood \nImprovement in the Central Highlands Sector Project to be provided by the Trust \nFund for Forests on a grant basis; and \n(iv)  If the Board approves the proposals, I, acting under the authority delegated by \nthe Board, will approve ADB providing the balance of the technical assistance not \nexceeding the equivalent of $250,000 for the Project. \n \n \n                Haruhiko Kuroda \n                President \n \n5 October 2006 ", "Appendix 1  21 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE FORESTRY SECTOR \n \n1.  Current external assistance to the forestry sector is estimated at over $400 million \nequivalent, and there are at least 21 development partners contributing over $1 million. Among \nthese,  the  most  prominent  are  Asian  Development  Bank,  Australia,  Canada,  Denmark, \nEuropean Union, Finland, Global Environment Facility, Germany, International Development \nAssociation of the World Bank, Japan, The Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland. \n \nA.  Forest Sector Support Program and Partnership \n \n2.  The Forest Sector Support Program and Partnership (FSSP) is a broad framework for \ncollaboration between the Government of Viet Nam and over 24 international development \npartners now working in the forestry sector. The FSSP memorandum of agreement includes 15 \nbasic principles of collaboration agreed among the partners and a program framework that \nspecifies indicative performance standards for the broad goal, focused objective, and purpose, \nas well as specific activities under nine result areas. \n \nTable A1.1: Forest Sector Support Program Result Areas \n \nResult Area  Specific Activities \n1  Collaborative planning and monitoring of strategic developments \n2  Policy, legal, and institutional frameworks \n3 and 4  Macro and micro land-use planning \n5  State forest enterprise reform \n6  Sustainable forest management planning and implementation \n7  Sustainable use and conservation of indigenous flora and fauna \n8  Research, training, and extension \n9  Marketing and processing \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n3.  The FSSP program framework, with its nine result areas, will likely be replaced by the \nforthcoming national forest strategy (NFS, 2006\u20132020), as the key document for collaborative \nsupport and implementation by both national and international partners. \n \nB.  Trust Fund for Forests \n \n4.  Viet Nam\u2019s Trust Fund for Forests (TFF) is a grant facility established in June 2004 to \nsupport pro-poor and sustainable approaches to forest management, and a transition towards a \ncomprehensive sector-wide approach for development and cooperation in the forest sector. By \npooling  resources  from  several  funding  agencies  into  one  fund,  TFF  will  provide  a  more \neffective means of supporting key sectoral priorities, which are agreed and updated annually by \nthe FSSP partnership. \n \n5.  Finland, The Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland have pledged to contribute around \n$28 million to the fund in 2004\u20132007. Moreover, the German Government has provided MARD \nwith technical assistance to help manage the fund through the project Reform of the Forestry \nAdministration System. \n \n ", "22  Appendix 1 \nTable A1.2: Trust Fund for Forests Funding \n($) \n \nFunding Source  Earmarked  General  Total \nThe Netherlands  6,019,047  4,815,238  10,834,285 \nSwitzerland     1,203,809  1,203,809 \nFinland  5,000,000  7,307,020  12,307,020 \nSweden    3,800,000  3,800,000 \nGermany (GTZ)  In kind     \nGTZ = Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) (German Agency for Technical Cooperation). \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n6.  Two technical advisors have worked with the FSSP coordination office and relevant \nministries since November 2004 to develop TFF regulations and operational procedures, launch \noperations, and build capacity to manage the fund. In 2004, the FSSP Technical Executive \nCommittee  approved  five  small  TFF  grants  totalling  \u20ac200,000.  Currently,  the  committee  is \nappraising  two  proposals  for  full  projects.  Work  will  commence  in  2005  on  developing \nbenchmarks for sectoral budget support. \n \nC.  Past Investment Levels in the Sector \n \n7.  Total investment in the sector, according to the Forestry Development Strategy (FDS) in \n1999, was around D1.185 trillion, equivalent to around $76.5 million, of which 85%, or around \n$65 million, was for silviculture. However, an ADB-funded study (TA 3255\u2013VIE) on Forest Policy \nand Institutional Framework suggests that expenditure in 1999 was only D314 billion, or $22 \nmillion. Table A1.3 below summarizes the current relationship between planned targets, actual \nareas planted, and expenditure. \n \nTable A1.3: Targets, Actual Areas Planted, and Expenditure on Plantations \n \nTarget Area to be  Reported Area  Reported/Required  Average Cost per \nYear  Planted Annually  Planted Annually  Annual Expenditure  Ha \n(ha)  (ha)  ($\u2019000)  ($) \nPlanned 1999\u20132005  500,000    300,000  600a  \n(FDS) \nActual 1999 (FDS)    311,000  65,000  209 \nActual 1999 (TA    311,000  22,000  70 \n3255\u2013VIE) \nFDS = Forestry Development Strategy, ha = hectare, TA = technical assistance. \na Based on current cost norms for plantations establishment. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n8.  The funds provided for investment are insufficient to achieve the planted area targets set \nin the 661 Program and the FDS. The apparent actual investment for planting 1 hectare (ha) is \n12\u201330% of the current cost norm for plantation establishment. Part of this difference may that \nsome of the labor is provided unpaid in return for a share of future benefits and is not being \nvalued. However, low investment is almost certainly a major contributory factor to the poor \nperformance of the plantations established. Only about 3% of the value of current output from \nthe forestry sector is being invested in maintaining this important economic resource. \n ", "Appendix 2  23 \nPROBLEM TREE ANALYSIS \n \n

Introduction \n \n1.  The overarching goal of the Forests for Livelihood Improvement in the Central Highlands \nSector Project (the Project) is to improve the livelihoods of isolated upland rural communities \nliving  in  and  adjacent  to  forestland  in  a  sustainable  manner  that  will  also  facilitate  forest \nimprovement and natural resource management. Villages of the Central Highlands are largely \npopulated by indigenous or other minority groups. The livelihoods development and ethnic \nminorities development plan (LIEMDP) is formulated as a time-bound program to ensure that \nethnic minority groups living in 60 communes in the six provinces of the Central Highlands will \nbenefit from project interventions, which aim to improve forestland allocation and management \nto reduce poverty and improve livelihoods in the area. The LIEMDP is based on detailed \nanalyses of poverty, ethnicity, and livelihoods in the project area in general and in sample \ncommunes in particular. It is expected to have beneficial impacts upon approximately 65,000 \nmembers of ethnic minorities and other poor households in approximately 6,000 villages in the \n60 communes selected. \n \n  1.  Poverty, Ethnicity, and Forests in the Central Highlands \n \n2.  Taken as a whole, the northwest and the Central Highlands are the poorest regions in \nthe country. According to the Vietnam Development Report 2004,1 the Central Highlands stand \nout because of their limited progress in poverty reduction over the past 4 years and because \nfood poverty in this central region has remained unchanged for the past decade. The report \ngoes on to predict that the overall poverty rate for Viet Nam in 2010 will be 21%, and that 37% \nof that figure will be ethnic minority people. Indeed, more recent times have seen an increase in \nthe Central Highlands poverty rate due to the collapse of coffee prices, a sharp drop in pepper \nprices, and the lack of a diversified local production base. The LIEMDP is a central document \nfor  project  design,  presenting  the  strategy  that  will  drive  poverty  reduction  in  targeted \ncommunities  throughout  the  Central  Highlands.  The  LIEMDP  is  based  upon  extensive \nparticipatory beneficiary consultations in the target provinces. In terms of its replicability, the \nLIEMDP is generic and the main strategies will remain the same. Only the specific income-\ngenerating  activities  adopted  by  different  communities  are  expected  to  vary,  as  will  some \ninternal implementation arrangements. \n \n3.  The objective of the LIEMDP is to provide an enabling environment in which a suitable \nstrategy  and  appropriate  mechanisms\u2014replicable  in  most  if  not  all  of  the  137  poor  forest \ncommunes in the Central Highlands\u2014to ensure sustainable livelihood improvement and access \nto  benefits  for  the  target  communities.  The  LIEMDP  has  been  formulated  such  that  most \nbeneficiaries belong to indigenous and other minority groups. \n \n4.  Poverty in Viet Nam is measured in a variety of ways, depending upon the agency \nconcerned. The Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs (MOLISA) uses a measure of \nhousehold income per capita as follows for 2001\u20132005: \n(i)  in highland and mountainous areas, per capita income of less than D80,000 per \nmonth or D960,000 per year; \n(ii)  in  flat  rural  areas,  per  capita  income  of  less  than  D100,000  per  month  or \nD1,200,000 per year; and, \n                                                 \n1 2003. Joint Donor Report to the Vietnam Consultative Group Meeting. Ha Noi. \n ", "38  Appendix 8 \n(iii)  in urban and peri-urban areas, per capita income of less than D150,000 per \nmonth or D1,800,000 per year. \n \n5.  The Government Statistics Office published a comparative view of the spatial incidence \nof poverty in 1993, 1998, and 2002. All regions of Viet Nam are compared against three poverty \nmeasures: overall poverty rate, food poverty rate, and poverty gap. According to this report, the \nCentral Highlands region has the second worst incidence of overall and food poverty and the \nsecond highest poverty gap of all regions. In fact, the figures suggest that poverty reduction in \nthe Central Highlands has lagged behind that of other regions, as it declined from third to \nsecond worst ranking for overall poverty between 1993 and 2002. A recent study\u2014funded by \nNew Zealand\u2019s International Aid and Development Agency (NZAID) in collaboration with the \nInter-Ministerial  Poverty  Mapping  Task  Force, International  Food  Policy  Research  Institute, \nInformation  Center  for  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development,  and  Institute  of  Development \nStudies\u2014used combined data from the 1998 Vietnam Living Standards Survey and the 1999 \nPopulation and Housing Census to map national poverty by commune. Although the analysis \ndiffers significantly from MOLISA estimates of poverty, the study confirms that the poorest \nregions are the remote areas of the northwest, upland areas of the north-central coast and the \nnorthern part of the Central Highlands.2 \n \n6.  According to this analysis, Dak Lak, Lam Dong, and Phu Yen are among the better-off \nprovinces in the country, while Gia Lai and Kon Tum are among the poorest. Phu Yen and Lam \nDong are not generally regarded as Central Highlands provinces, but both are contiguous to the \nproject area and have some districts in the upland and highland areas. Again, these upland and \nhighland areas are inhabited mainly by minority communities, and their socioeconomic well-\nbeing is significantly worse than conditions in lowland areas. Although there are undoubtedly \nmany poor Kinh (mainstream Vietnamese) households in the Central Highlands, ethnic minority \nhouseholds are more likely than Kinh to be poor. Poverty in the selected areas of the Central \nHighlands is marked by landlessness, periods of food and cash deficit, illiteracy, and lack of \naccess to forestland and forest resource exploitation. The poor suffer high illiteracy among \npeople above school age, particularly in indigenous communities. People lack savings or capital \nfor investing in better production technology and also lack awareness and knowledge of the \noptions available. Population growth in the Central Highlands has been dramatic, mainly due to \nthe migration of Kinh into the area. In 1998 only 4% of Viet Nam\u2019s population lived in the Central \nHighlands, but by 2002 this figure had risen to 6% and, over the same period, the percentage of \nethnic minorities in this population decreased from 45% to 39%. This in-migration can also help \nexplain the rise in poverty in the Central Highlands over recent years, as poor and perhaps \nlandless Kinh migrate into the area hoping to obtain cheap or government-allocated land. \n \n  2.  Poverty and Forest Resource Decline \n \n7.  Although the Central Highlands are the richest region in terms of forest resources, only \n3% of the income of Central Highlands dwellers comes from forestry. Local households\u2019 forestry \nactivities have been limited mainly to forest planting and care under contract. Also interesting is \nthat  the  Central  Highlands  contain  almost  50%  of  the  national  area  of  destroyed  forest, \npresumably due to slash-and-burn, shifting cultivation. Although now illegal, it is still practiced by \nthose  with  no  other  land  resources.  Field  studies  confirmed  that  most  of  the  forestland, \nespecially areas with good forest reserves in the Central Highlands, is owned by state forest \nenterprises (SFEs). All the forest area that has been allocated to the villagers is poor. The \n                                                 \n2  Minot, N., Baulch, B., and Epprecht, M.

Washington, DC: \nInternational Food Policy Research Institute. \n ", "Appendix 8  39 \nsurvey clearly shows that the forest\u2019s potential to benefit those living nearby has not been \nproperly exploited. The issuance of land-use certificates is still very limited, and this slow \nprogress has affected households\u2019 capital mobilization for production. \n \n8.  The Government has promulgated many different policies and regulations to facilitate \nrural development and poverty reduction, but they have been implemented with varying degrees \nof success. The Government has also made serious attempts to create an appropriate legal \nenvironment to facilitate implementation of its policies and programs. The Land Law of 2003 \nprovides for allocating long-term land-use rights to individuals, households, and communities of \nVietnamese living in the same villages and hamlets, or with similar customs and practices, or \nwith the same descents.3 This would allow assigning long-term land-use rights to ethnic minority \nand indigenous tribal communities. \n \n9.  The 2001\u20132005 Five-Year Plan and Fundamental Solutions for the Socioeconomic \nDevelopment  of  the  Central  Highlands.  This  plan  was  approved  through  Decision \n168/2001/QD on 30 October 2001 and is particularly relevant to the Project. It applies to the \nCentral Highlands provinces Dak Lak, Gia Lai, Kon Tum, and Lam Dong, seeking to facilitate \ndynamic development with a high but sustainable growth rate while protecting ecological and \nenvironmental resources. It aims to raise living standards and the quality of life in remote areas \ninhabited by ethnic minorities and other areas that encounter significant difficulties. It also hopes \nto build a strong and transparent political system and an equitable society. \n \n  3.  Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy \n \n10.  Specific mention is made of the need to improve and stabilize the living standards of \nethnic minorities in a manner that is compatible with their customs. The Comprehensive Poverty \nReduction  and  Growth  Strategy  aims  to  reduce  poverty  by  creating  new  and  improved \nopportunities for poor people to take part more fully in, and gain more benefit from, ongoing \nsocioeconomic reform and development. \n \n4.  Government of Viet Nam Agencies Responsible for Poverty Reduction and \nEthnic Minority Development \n \n11.  The most immediately relevant agencies involved in rural community and ethnic minority \ndevelopment are the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Committee for Ethnic and \nMinority Affairs, MOLISA, Vietnamese Women\u2019s Union, education, and health. \n \nB.  Community Forestry and Forest Land Allocation, Experiences, and Issues \n \n12.  In recent years, some community-based forestry initiatives have been piloted through \nfunding agency assistance programs such as the German Agency for Technical Cooperation \n(GTZ) Dak Lak project. These experiences indicate that conditions required for successful \ncommunity-based management include the following: \n(i)  Land allocation processes should be decided by the community. These need to \ntake  into  account  community  traditions,  traditional  boundaries,  village  social \ncomposition, earlier experiences with social forestry, and access to markets. \n(ii)  Benefit realization is fundamental to providing incentives for protecting forests. \nBenefits should be available to those receiving forestland and to others in the \ncommunity.  Benefit-sharing  policies  that  result  in  uniform  sharing  of  benefits \nneed to be developed within the community. \n                                                 \n3 Official Gazette Nos. 228\u2013229 (28/12/2003). \n ", "40  Appendix 8 \n(iii)   Community forest rules need to be developed and agreed by all members of the \ncommunity (and adjacent communities) and include penalties for noncompliance. \n(iv)  Access  to  capital  and  technical  and  marketing  advice  is  needed  to  ensure \nmaximum benefits are realized from the allocated forestland and that incentives \nto protect it are also maximized. \n \n  1.  Results of Participatory Appraisals Carried out in Sample Communes \n \n13.  Based  on  the  lessons  above,  the  LIEMDP  has  been  developed  on  the  basis  of \nparticipatory enquiries held with the indigenous and other ethnic minorities in the course of \nproject preparation. \n \n14.  Overall Conclusions from Field Studies. Poverty in the areas studied is patterned \nthematically across communities such that effectively tackling poverty reduction and livelihood \nimprovement requires addressing these thematic issues in a strategic manner. To prescribe a \nlist  of  investments  without  building  a  mechanism  within  the  target  communities  to  build \nempowerment and the capacity to address poverty reduction needs locally would be a design \noversight. \n \n15.  Access to Forests, Forest Land, and Agricultural Lowland. Ethnic minority groups \ntraditionally live in or on the borders of forested areas and survive by hunting, collecting non-\ntimber  forest  products,  and  cultivating  various  crops.  They  were  denied  access  to  these \nlivelihood resources when forested land was passed to SFEs. In reality, they have received very \nlittle land. The allocation of agricultural land to households and forested land to communities \nmust take place.  \n \n16.  Cultures, Traditions, and Religious and Behavioral Differences. These must be \ntaken into consideration when designing interventions and their implementation to ensure that \nthey are appropriate.  \n \n17.  Access  to  Services,  Technology,  and  Capital.  These  communities\u2019  access  to \ntechnology  or  services  is  constrained  by  their  geographic  isolation,  poor  roads  and \ncommunications, illiteracy, and lack of cash and savings for investment. Heads of household, \nparticularly  in  middle  and  lower  socioeconomic  groups,  are  generally  illiterate  in  the  Kinh \nlanguage. The community suffers from poor delivery of education and health services. \n \n18.  Minority communities hold very few assets or farming tools and are inexperienced in \nintensive agriculture, which is necessary on small flatland plots and home gardens. Agricultural \nextension services are ineffective. \n \n19.  Farming systems are very basic and extensive, with low inputs. Yields are low, and no \nprocessing  is  done  to  add  value.  Most  ethic  minority  members  are  basically  subsistence \nfarmers, and some still engage in slash-and-burn, shifting cultivation, although this is illegal. \nLivelihood insecurity is a big problem. \n \n20.  Ethnic Minority Participation. The goal of the LIEMDP is to reduce the incidence of \npoverty and improve food security among ethnic minority communities who form the poorest \nsections of the population in the project area. \n \n21.  The immediate objective is to increase the benefits of forest management and use by \ngrassroots communities, in partnership with state and other agencies, to improve the livelihoods \n ", "Appendix 8  41 \nof forest-dependent communes in the 60 target communes in the selected provinces. These \ncommunes are taken from the MOLISA list of the 137 poorest communes in the six provinces. \nEthnic  minorities  occupy  shares  of  the  population  of  these  communes  ranging  from \napproximately 50% to 100% and suffer poverty rates of 40\u201360% and higher. These communes \nalso have productive forestlands available for allocation under the Project. \n \n22.  The intended beneficiaries are ethnic minority and other poor households, communities, \nand village and commune forest protection boards. \n \n  2.  Components and Outputs \n \n    a.  Sustainable Forest Resource Development and Management \n \n23.  Forestland Management Planning. Using a participatory approach involving multiple \nstakeholders, the Project will support upgrading provincial land and forestland use strategies in \naccordance  with  the  new  Land  and  Forest  Protection  laws.  This  will  include  rationalizing \nforestland use objectives and management regimes in provinces, districts, and communes. The \nProject will provide the enabling governance and incentive framework for sustainable natural \nforest and plantation development and management, the restructuring of SFEs, and accelerated \nand equitable forestland allocation. \n \n24.  Covering over 3 million ha of production forests, the Project will support the following \nactivities under this component: \n(i)  Regarding  forest  zoning  and  identifying  production  clusters,  the  Project  will \nsupport provincial, district, and commune forest resource management planning \nand zoning based on geographic information systems (GIS). \n(ii)  It will lead the delineation, surveying, and demarcation of forests to clearly and \npermanently  define  forest  boundaries,  irrespective  of  land  ownership  and/or \nmanagement regimes. \n(iii)  Regarding forest inventory and management planning, the Project will support \nthe preparation of detailed forest management plans for over 3 million ha, in \nconsultation with participating stakeholders. This will minimize forestland use and \nmanagement  conflicts  and  achieve  economies  of  scale  in  terms  of  project \nmanagement,  as  well  as  of  production  and  marketing.  Sustainable  forest \nmanagement  plans  will  be  approved  by  provincial  people\u2019s  committees  and \nbecome the business plan for provincial forestry. \n \n25.  The Project will address one of the fundamental issues of both forest management and \npoverty reduction in the Central Highlands: forest boundary demarcation and land allocation. \nLocal communities and all stakeholders will be involved in this process. The Project will support \nspecial measures to enable the participation of hitherto excluded sections of local communities, \nespecially ethnic minorities and women, by building their literacy in the Vietnamese language \nand increasing their access to information, training, and extension programs. Empowerment via \nfunctionality in different languages will develop in tandem with local communities\u2019 rediscovering \ntheir indigenous knowledge, especially regarding forest-related activities. \n \n26.  The Project will also build the capacity of state agencies to implement ethnic minority\u2013\nsensitive participatory planning and implementation in forestry. These measures are expected to \nbring under the management of the 60 selected communes approximately 180,000\u2013480,000 ha, \nincreasing the forest resources available for livelihood improvement. Local communities and all \nstakeholders will be involved in surveying to ensure consensus on forest boundaries. In areas \n ", "42  Appendix 8 \nwhere demarcation cannot be done by natural features, permanent markers such as concrete \nposts will ideally be used. However, permanent colored markings on trees and rocks can be \nused,  with  their  positions  recorded  on  the  map  record  using  global  positioning  systems. \nTraditional leaders of ethnic minority communities will participate in the process, along with \ncommune people\u2019s committees, to include consideration of traditional boundaries of village \nforestlands in boundary demarcation. \n \n27.  Small and Fragmented Forest Tracts. Small forest tracts will generally be allocated to \ncommunities to manage. A similar set of activities will be undertaken for these blocks as part of \npreparing commune investment plans (CIPs), but procedures will be simplified as much as \npossible to keep paperwork to a minimum. \n \n28.  The  management  of  forest  areas  will  be  achieved  by  implementing  participatory \nrehabilitation and management of protected forests by protected forest management boards, \nand of special-use forests by (i) participatory protection of protected forest areas with usufruct \nsharing, (ii) planting indigenous tree species, and (iii) enrichment planting in degraded areas. \n \n29.  The Project will see community forest planting by communes and village communities, \nimproved  forest  management,  and  increased  valuation  of  forest  resources  under  village \ncommunity ownership or tenure in at least 60 selected communes covering a total area between \n180,000 and 480,000 ha. Participatory protection of forests shall also be done over the area \nplanted by communes and areas for which they enter into contractual obligations with state \nagencies. The proposed community forestry activities for the selected 60 communes will include \n(i)  planting indigenous species; \n(ii)  forest restoration and enrichment planting in degraded natural forests; \n(iii)  creating village woodlots with fast-growing tree species to meet local fuel wood \nand small timber needs, as well as for commercial purposes; \n(iv)  agroforestry practices; \n(v)  farm forestry and homestead planting, especially for fruit trees; \n(vi)  participatory protection of natural forest; and \n(vii)  developing basic infrastructure for the overall development of the commune. \n \n30.  Business Development. The Project will support (i) the promotion of small and medium \nenterprises  and  household  economic  development  opportunities  to  support  the  productive \nsector\u2019s adding value to forest-derived goods and services in the Central Highlands, (ii) SFE \nrestructuring to set up efficient forest-related enterprises and to release land for community use, \nand  (iii)  pilot  measures  to  promote  the  clean  development  mechanism,  ecotourism,  and \nrenewable energy in the Central Highlands. \n \n    b.  Livelihood Improvement (Community Support) \n \n31.  The  Project  will  support  livelihood  improvement  and  income  generation  in  the  60 \ncommunes by establishing a commune development fund (CDF) in each of the 60 communes \nwith seed capital of $20,000 per CDF. These will be revolving funds, each CDF handling its own \nincome generation and project investment funds on a sustainable basis. \n \n32.  Commune investment plans for small-scale infrastructure and forestry activities in the 60 \ntarget communes, covering about 400,000 people in over 80,000 households, will be prepared \nand implemented by the beneficiaries and supported with functioning and sustainable CDFs. \nThe main objective of the livelihood-improvement, or community support, component of the \nProject is to have functioning CDFs in place in the 60 selected communes of the project area to \n ", "Appendix 8  43 \nsupport  income-generating  activities  and  develop  and  maintain  small-scale  commune \ninfrastructure. \n \n33.  Commune  investment  plans  (CIPs)  will  be  drawn  up  in  the  communes,  and  their \nimplementation  by  beneficiaries  will  be  supported  by  functioning  and  sustainable  CDFs. \nLivelihood  improvement  under  the  Project  will  focus  on  two  sub-components,  namely \n(i) establishing CDFs for undertaking income-generating activities and (ii) rural infrastructure \nsupport. \n \n34.  The CDF scheme is a self-funding mechanism to distribute the benefits of forestland and \nforest resource allocation throughout the beneficiary community and will actively drive local \npoverty reduction. It will not be just a project account for channeling project funds to communes, \nbut  should  be  an  active  fund  through  which  beneficiaries  receive  project  funds  under \nGovernment programs and other income or revenue that the community beneficiaries may \ngenerate  through  various  economic  activities,  including  selling  products  gathered  from  the \ncommunity forest. CDFs should not be drawn down by expenditures on project activities, but \ncontinue as revolving funds for the commune with two accounts as described below. \n \n35.  Technical assistance (TA) grant support will help communes build capacity to manage \ntheir CDF, provide farming systems advice, and carry out planning and monitoring. CDFs will \nhave  \n(i)  a  project  account,  in  which  project  loan  funds  will  be  disbursed  for  project \nactivities, and. \n(ii)  a  commune  revenue  account,  which  can  receive  seed  money  to  establish \nlivelihood  improvement  activities  identified  by  the  producer  groups  in  the \ncommune, as well as funds from the Trust Fund for Forests (TFF). \nAll  interest accrued  from  the  project  account will  be  transferred  to  the  commune  revenue \naccount for the commune to use for livelihood improvement. \n \n36.  Small-Scale Community Infrastructure Support. The Project will support the funding \nof  small-scale  rural  infrastructure  to  help  communes  improve  (i)  such  social  amenities  as \ndrinking water supply, school rooms, and health clinics; (ii) access to roads and markets by \nrepairing and improving village access roads; and (iii) small-scale irrigation by constructing \nsmall dams and irrigation channels. \n \n37.  Each  commune  selected  under  the  Project  for  community  support  will  receive \ninvestment funds of up to $275,000 from the loan, of which up to 30% can be invested in small \ninfrastructure. The remaining 70% must be invested in forest-related activities. Adjustments can \nbe made freely between activities within each category, as the beneficiaries see fit, by using \nannual work plans to adjust proposals and targets already laid down in a CIP approved by \ndistrict and provincial authorities. \n \n    c.  Capacity Development \n \n38.  Capacity development includes strengthening institutional capacity in communes and \ndistricts through staff training and providing equipment for extension and enterprise support \nservices to communities, households, and small and medium enterprises. \n \n39.  Capacity building for ethnic minority groups in village communities is essential, as is \ncapacity building for commune and village officials for establishing CDFs, handling finances, \nand producing simple financial statements and physical target monitoring reports. Other training \n ", "44  Appendix 8 \nneeds include improved functional literacy and language proficiency; poverty reduction through \nextension with a focus on ethnic minorities; information and communications technology for \nselected  communes;  enterprise  development;  training  for  project  implementation  staff  in \ndistricts, provinces, and the central Government; and training for GIS and database utilization \nand for monitoring and evaluation (M&E). \n \n  3.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n40.  The LIEMDP will be monitored as part of overall monitoring of project implementation. \nImpact  assessment  of  the  LIEMDP  will  form  part  of  the  overall  M&E  process.  It  will  be \nnecessary to create an enabling environment in which sub-commune residents can develop \nindicators to evaluate. All progress reports prepared by the executing agency (EA) will address \nthe LIEMDP goal, objectives, and components and report on achievements, problems, and \nfuture strategies. At midterm review and project completion, external monitoring will be carried \nout by an external institution engaged by the EA with ADB approval. External monitoring will be \nboth quantitative and qualitative. Participatory research will be carried out to fully involve ethnic \nminority communities and women in assessing how well the strategies visualized under the \nLIEMDP and the Project have delivered benefits. \n \n41.  Some  indicators  for  measuring  the  achievement  of  this  goal  relate  to  income \nimprovement, others to better health outcomes, and others to a greater degree of informed \nparticipation in community decision making by marginalized residents. Still others relate to \nintangibles such as self esteem, sense of vulnerability, sense of control, and social inclusion. \nMany indicators will be locally determined according to the outlook of ethnic groups. Broadly \nspeaking, however, a list of indicators including both quantitative and qualitative ones may \ninclude increased \n(i)  numbers of beneficiary households; \n(ii)  average forest-based incomes; \n(iii)  employment; \n(iv)  wages and incomes of forest enterprise workers; \n(v)  forest areas legally owned or managed by households; \n(vi)  food  security  in  terms  of  food  availability  in  households  year-round,  food \nallocation within households, and nutritional adequacy; \n(vii)  value of social infrastructure in rural communities; \n(viii)  household forestry enterprises, \n(ix)  savings in households and communities; \n(x)  percentage  of  communities  and  households  with  access  to  safe  water  and \nsanitation; \n(xi)  capacity of workers in forest-related industries; \n(xii)  participation of ethnic minority women and men in community-based decision \nmaking on forestland demarcation, allocation, and utilization; and \n(xiii)  use of non-timber forest products by communities. \n \nC.  Conclusion \n \n42.  It must be noted that the LIEMDP is a generic document, which can be adapted to a \nvariety of commune situations. Although it represents a sum of community choices for project \nimplementation, community validation of the LIEMDP during implementation will heighten local \nownership, thereby improving its effectiveness. Careful calibration of the LIEMDP with other \nproject  components  will  likely  bring  to  communities  significantly  improved  livelihood,  both \nmaterial and not, even for the poorest and most vulnerable groups in the Central Highlands. \n ", "Appendix 9  45 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nA.

The Central Highlands have biodiversity of high \nnational and international importance. All indigenous ethnic minority groups have traditionally derived a significant \nportion of their livelihood by harvesting timber and non-timber forest products (NTFPs) for household use. Upland rice \nand other crops were grown in forest clearings with long fallows. However, ethnic minorities\u2019 traditional use of the \nforests has gradually waned on account of Government policies restricting access to forest areas. The Government \nhas, until recently, allocated large forest areas to state forest enterprises (SFEs), leading to a net reduction in \nproductive forest areas available to people. In addition, the role of communities in forests has been reduced to \nprotection and maintenance functions contracted by SFEs and highly restricted access to NTFPs. All these factors \nhave contributed to worsening poverty among ethnic minority communities over the years. The Forestry Sector Project \nassisted by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other projects have facilitated the development of new thinking \nwith regard to the likely contribution of the forestry sector to poverty reduction. The denuded condition of many \nforestlands has also brought about the realization that joint management of forests with communities in partnership \nwith government can provide greater protection and sustainable use of the resources for reducing poverty among rural \ncommunities in the Central Highlands, as well as facilitate reforestation and environmental improvements. The \nGovernment\u2019s new approach is to provide communities with rights to use forests to improve their livelihood and to \nprotect forests with conservation and sustainable management. The proposed Forests for Livelihood Improvement in \nthe Central Highlands Sector Project (the Project) will aim to develop this further by providing capacity building, \ntechnical assistance (TA), and financial resources to government agencies and communities so that they can better \nwork together for the common good. \n \nB.

Introduction \n \n1.  This gender action plan (GAP) ensures that poor rural women benefit equitably with men \n(with emphasis on the indigenous communities of the Central Highlands) from investments \nmade under the Forests for Livelihood Improvement in the Central Highlands Sector Project (the \nProject). The GAP is based upon participatory research and consultations carried out in the six \nprovinces covered by the Project as part of project preparation. The GAP is based on two \npremises, one of which involves the return of forestland use to women and men living in \ncommunities  and  households  located  in  and  around  forested  areas,  for  their  livelihood \ndevelopment and sustainable management. However, returning forestlands without technical \nsupport and other opportunities for livelihood diversification will not lead to many improved \nconditions. Therefore, the GAP includes setting up commune funds that can be accessed by \ncommunities for improving their income-earning opportunities. These funds can also generate \nrevenues  to  support  forest-based  activities  and  improvements  to  social  and  physical \ninfrastructure and services. All of these interventions are based on gender analyses of the \nlivelihoods,  priorities,  and  needs  of  poor  rural  communities,  particularly  ethnic  minorities, \ninhabiting  these  areas.  Gender-sensitive  strategies  to  augment  access  to  resources  and \nlivelihoods are expected to improve the lives in particular of ethnic minority women and men in \nthe project areas. \n \n2.  The people who are the subjects of this GAP lack access to commune resources. Most \nof the women and many of the men are illiterate and lack mainstream Kinh language skills and \nso  cannot  make  their  needs  felt  by  commune  authorities.  While  the  commune  is  the \nadministrative unit, it is important to include planning and implementation of livelihoods activities \nin villages or hamlets to include the most vulnerable and poorest members of local communities \nin the Project. Traditional leaders of ethnic minority villages, including elders\u2019 groups and groups \nof women, will be among those who need to be mobilized to bring their voices into the planning \nprocess. \n \n  1.  Gender Issues \n \n3.  The analysis of gender issues is based on a review of the situation of ethnic minority \ncommunities in particular, as well as the gender concerns of Kinh women in the project area. \nThe Project potentially affects approximately 400,000 people in 80,000 households in the 60 \ncommunes of the six project provinces, of which five are in the Central Highlands. The other \nprovince, Phu Yen, adjoins the Central Highlands. Poverty is high in these provinces1 and in \nparticular in the communes inhabited by ethnic minorities (where poverty rates are 50\u201360% and \nhigher) on account of their loss of traditional forest-based livelihoods without compensation. \nEthnic minorities indigenous to the Central Highlands are of the Mon Khmer ethno-linguistic \ngroup. They have suffered of the most from the loss of access to productive forests because \ntheir livelihoods were the most dependent upon forests. The 10 Mon Khmer ethno-linguistic \ngroups in the Central Highlands include the relatively large Ro Mam and Ba Na, each with \napproximately 215,000 people. The other ethno-linguistic group partly indigenous to the Central \nHighlands is the Malayo Polynesian group, which includes the Ede, numbering approximately \n350,000, and the Chu Ru, who are few in number. Non-indigenous ethnic minority groups \ninclude the Hmong, Tay, Thai, Nung, Lu, and Dao. Ethnic minorities constitute approximately \n50% of the population in Kon Tum, 43% in Gia Lai, 29% in Dak Lak, 22% in Lam Dong, and 5% \n                                                 \n1  As per the report New Zealand Aid. 2003. Poverty and Inequality in Vietnam. The percentage of rural population in \npoverty in Gia Lai is approximately 63%, Kon Tum 65%, Dak Lak 50%, Lam Dong 46%, and Phu Yen 46%. \n ", "48  Appendix 10 \nin Phu Yen. The kinship system of most of the upland indigenous ethnic minority groups \n(UIEMGs) has a clear matrilineal bias, particularly regarding the ownership and inheritance of \nland, including forestland. Traditional ownership systems define the kinds of reciprocal relations \nthat exist within lineage groups and the extent of mutual exchange permitted with others. The \nnew Land Law, approved in 2003, accords equal rights to women and men for having property \nregistered in their name. As the allocation of land titles has not proceeded apace in the Central \nHighlands,  its  impact  on  women\u2019s  customary  land  rights  in  unclear.  However,  vestiges  of \ntraditional matrilineal land-holding systems will be relevant when forestlands are about to be \nallocated, particularly if customary rights are to be included, as is essential for empowering \nethnic minority communities to improve their livelihoods. \n \n4.  The social position of women in UIEMGs is supposed to be superior to that of Kinh \nwomen  and  other  lowland  ethnic  groups.  Most  of  the  latter  groups  are  characterized  by \npatriarchal norms underpinning family and community relations and functions. These include \nsubstantial  deference  toward  men  in  most  matters,  both  domestic  and  public.  Among  the \nUIEMGs, women did not in theory have to deal with such patriarchal systems of deference and \ncontrol, as the matriarchal systems tilted in their favor. Men came to live in the homes of their \nwives after marriage, preserving women\u2019s support from their own families and kin groups. \nAccess to land for men was mediated by their relations with women. However, given the \nsignificant responsibilities of women in food production and domestic roles, men were supposed \nto  deal  with  external  forces,  giving  them  substantial  roles  in  public  decision  making  and \nmediation  with  the  state.  Women  of  UIEMGs  have  lost  out  through  the  gradual  loss  of \nforestlands to the state.2 \n \n5.  Today, the situation of UIEMG women is characterized by pressure on account of a \nnumber of factors. As the communities lost access to forestlands, both women and men came \nunder pressure to grow sufficient food to meet household requirements. Among the UIEMG, \nwomen collected forest foods to supplement upland agriculture, in which women played an \nequal role. As there was no plowing involved in upland farming, women were quite self-sufficient \nin producing crops in temporary fields, after they were first cleared by men. In addition to \nclearing land, men hunted and harvested timber. However, the loss of forestlands drastically \nreduced the scope for such activities. As forest foods provided sustenance in periods of rice \nshortage, as well as supplementing families\u2019 diets at all times, women tried to sell forest produce \nand handicrafts to procure food in times of shortage. Women bear full responsibility for domestic \nwork, which lengthens their workday by several hours beyond that of men. The lack of culturally \nappropriate reproductive health options and inadequate water supply and sanitation systems \ncause reproductive health problems. The lack of safe water increases women\u2019s workload, as \ndoes family ill health. The improved availability of basic amenities in these communes will go a \nlong way toward reducing women\u2019s vulnerabilities and improving the health and well-being of \nthe entire community. \n \n6.  While women are clearly more hard pressed than men under the shrinkage of livelihoods \nresources, traditional patterns of decision making also appears to be changing in response to \nchanging circumstances. While decision making on a range of domestic issues is shared, \nincreased  contact  with  mainstream  lowland  communities  has  increased  men\u2019s  personal \nexpenditures on alcohol and tobacco and claim, over which women have no control (as is true in \nmainstream society). \n                                                 \n2  From the 1970s, state enterprises for developing plantations of coffee, tea, and rubber, as well as agro-industries, \ncontrolled approximately 70\u201380% of the natural forest area of the Central Highlands provinces. In 1993, the Land \nCode severely restricted communities\u2019 access to NTFPs from forestlands under state control. \n ", "Appendix 10  49 \n7.  Then again, women\u2019s traditional knowledge of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) and \nupland agriculture without chemical inputs is increasingly regarded as useless, such that men, \nwho know somewhat more about intensive lowland rice and other crops, appear to be gaining \nthe upper hand. This is particularly so regarding new crops and farming techniques. When \nethnic minority communities relocate and receive land for cash cropping, men tend to take over \ncritical decisions on crop production. They are the ones to negotiate with officials and others \nregarding  cash  cropping  and  appear  to  make  decisions  regarding  land-use  changes  and \ninvestment in chemical fertilizers, which increases investments in agriculture. While women\u2019s \ntraditional knowledge increasingly comes to be regarded as irrelevant, women are also losing \ntheir decision-making position with regard to land and resource allocation. This, along with \nreduced access to land, does not augur well for women\u2019s position. The new Land Law does deal \nwith the issue of land titles for both spouses, but its implementation goes back only to 2001. A \nlot remains to be done in granting equal land rights to men and women. The Project is expected \nto  do  much  by  providing  equal  land  rights  to  productive  forestlands  to  women  and  men. \nGranting legal, secure access to productive forestlands will benefit not only women but entire \nUIEMGs. \n \n8.  Women\u2019s traditional knowledge of livestock rearing commands respect in communities. \nWomen are responsible for rearing and maintaining small and large livestock but prefer smaller \nlivestock because of disease problems with larger ones. Men are generally responsible for \nselling and buying larger livestock. During participatory consultations, women revealed their \npreference for increased livestock resources for livelihoods improvement. The Project will help \nwomen to acquire additional livestock resources through the commune-based funds to be set up \nfor livelihoods and building social infrastructure. \n \n9.  Women of UIEMGs lack literacy and numerical skills. They usually do not speak or \nunderstand the Kinh language and thereby are excluded from officially disseminated information \nand training and extension services, among other aspects of mainstream economic and political \nlife. This gap needs to be addressed to improve women\u2019s capability to participate in activities \nunder the Project in particular and in the development process in general. The Project will aim to \nprovide  an  enabling  environment  for  local  women  to  participate  effectively  in  all  levels  of \ngovernance. \n \n  2.  Gender Interventions Required \n \n10.  The following are some of the gender-related interventions that the Government must \nput  in  place,  working  with  the  Vietnamese  Women\u2019s  Union  (VWU),  nongovernment \norganizations  (NGOs)  working  on  gender  issues,  and  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  to \nmaximize  the  positive  outcomes  of  development  on  ethnic  minority  women  in  the  Central \nHighlands. These include \n(i)  training in adding value to existing and potential NTFPs and ensuring marketing \narrangements; \n(ii)  using women\u2019s indigenous knowledge, especially of forests, to add more value to \nforest-based activities; \n(iii)  diversifying women\u2019s access to higher value commodities (the Japan Fund for \nPoverty  Reduction\u2013assisted  project  for  developing  eri  silk  production  among \nethnic minority women will provide valuable experience for replication); \n(iv)  increasing the availability of affordable credit for women, with improved targeting \nof UIEMG women; \n(v)  gender-sensitization training including UIEMG perspectives for upland women \nand men as well as others; \n ", "50  Appendix 10 \n(vi)  literacy empowerment programs for UIEMG women and men; \n(vii)  designing culturally appropriate health programs; and \n(viii)  incorporating  key  components  of  Gender  Strategy  in  Agriculture  and  Rural \nDevelopment to the Year 2010 (Decision No. 4776QD-BNN/TCCB, 28 January \n2003) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) in programs \nto monitor and evaluate the changing status of ethnic minority women in forest-\nbased livelihoods improvement. \n \nB.  Draft Gender Strategy \n \n11.  MARD\u2019s gender strategy is designed to improve gender equity, promote women\u2019s status \nin  agriculture  and  rural  development,  and  strengthen  the  institutionalization  of  gender-\nresponsive planning in the sector. One of the key objectives is to increase women\u2019s access to \nresources, in particular land, including forestlands. Another is to increase gender awareness, \ninclude gender-disaggregated indicators in monitoring, and increase gender-sensitive planning \nand implementation of programs and projects, particularly with regard to training and extension \nservices. All in all, the gender strategy aims to empower women and increase their participation \nin decision making at all levels. \n \n12.  This GAP is designed specifically to meet the needs of project communes in the Central \nHighlands. It stands together with the ethnic minorities development plan (EMDP) prepared for \nthe Project and needs to be understood and implemented in conjunction with the EMDP so that \ngender issues are properly addressed. \n \n13.  The principles upon which the GAP is based include  \n(i)  equal project opportunity and benefit-sharing between women and men, \n(ii)  systematic  measures  to  reduce  gender  inequality  in  project  areas  regarding \nforest-related interventions, \n(iii)  a targeted approach for poor women lacking livelihoods, \n(iv)  collecting gender-disaggregated data including stakeholder-designed monitoring \nand evaluation (M&E), \n(v)  facilitating an enabling environment to support women\u2019s capacity building and \nparticipation in all phases of project activities and mainstream gender beyond the \nEMDP, and \n(vi)  increased representation of women in decision-making bodies at all levels. \n \n14.  The GAP has the overall goal of reducing poverty in approximately 600 villages in the 60 \ncommunes in the project area. More specifically, the aim is to reduce the incidence of food-poor \nhouseholds and increase the incomes of poor households, with a particular focus on UIEMG \nwomen. The Project will contribute to this goal by introducing sustainable forest management \nand biodiversity conservation by communities, the state and other entities. \n \n15.  Women are likely to benefit from investments in forestry-related activities and improved \naccess to social infrastructure, as well as from measures to build their capacity and reduce \ndrudgery, according to consultations with women in the project areas and the priorities they \nidentified.  \n \n16.  Benefits for women will arise primarily from the return of forestlands to communities and \nhouseholds. While this is a step in the right direction, returning forestlands will not itself reduce \npoverty in the short run. Immediate sources of income will be required, so it will be important to \ninclude non-forest activities such as livestock rearing, which has been prioritized by women and \n ", "Appendix 10  51 \ncommune people\u2019s committee (CPC) officials. Particular livelihoods chosen will relate to the \nresource base of individual communes. However, the fundamental need is to ensure women\u2019s \nequal  access  to  resources  and  provide  special  capacity-building  efforts  to  facilitate  their \ninformed participation. \n \n17.  Capacity building for gender-responsive planning, implementation, and M&E will need to \nbe provided by the executing agency (EA) nationally, provincially, and in districts. There are no \nwomen employed in provincial DARD planning and management. While competent women work \nin  VWU  at  the  provincial  level,  female  staff  are  needed  with  technical  training  in  forest \nmanagement. In most areas, VWU has acquired sufficient experience in working with ethnic \nminority communities, but it often has difficulty targeting UIEMG women. The Project will need \nto work with VWU to develop training programs for them for NTFP processing and value \naddition, which can become important income-earning activities. VWU may need external help \nin designing culturally appropriate literacy programs or supporting culturally acceptable health \nprograms. GAP recommends using external facilitators from Tay Ngyuen University in Pleiku or \nNGOs with demonstrated experience in Viet Nam. \n \n18.  Low  literacy  among  older  women  is  recognized  as  weakening  their  capacity  to \nparticipate and absorb learning and information disseminated by government agencies. Among \nyounger  women,  literacy  rates  are  close  to  national  averages.  Wherever  possible,  project \ninformation will need to be translated into different ethnic minority languages. However, younger \nwomen who are bilingual can play valuable roles in project implementation. The GAP rests on \nthe premise that, unless UIEMG women are enabled to participate fully, the project outcomes \nwill not be sustainable from a gender perspective. Younger, bilingual ethnic minority women can \nbe employed as facilitators and trained to work with other women\u2019s groups. \n \n19.  As decision making in villages will focus on the role of traditional councils of elders, \nwhere women are not represented, gender sensitizing these councils will be undertaken so that \nwomen\u2019s interests are considered in deliberations and decisions. Women will make up 40% of \nthe membership of community development funds (CDFs) set up under the Project. Through \ntheir participation in CDFs, as well as during participatory land-use planning and land allocation \n(PLUPLA), women will be provided with the enabling environment they require to participate and \nforward their interests. Besides, all forest and other land will be allocated to women and men \nwith joint title under the Land Law of 2003. \n \n20.  As project activities in forestry and infrastructure development are community based, \nsafeguards are required to ensure that women do not provide free labor. Women\u2019s existing \nworkloads need to be considered, and their labor must be compensated at the same rate as for \nmen for similar activities. As far as agroforestry with individual households is concerned, the \ninitial payment from loan should be made to household members who actually provide the labor \nand not to the putative household head. Women\u2019s preferences for activities should be assessed \nthrough household surveys assisted by CDFs. \n \n21.  An important aspect of the Project will be joint ventures between restructured state forest \nenterprises (SFEs) and the newly constituted CDFs. The gender profile of most SFEs is not very \ngood, particularly at senior levels.

Economic Rationale for Investment in Forestry in Central Highlands \n1.  The  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy  (CPRGS)  of  the \nGovernment of Viet Nam aims to reduce poverty rapidly and ensure that all Vietnamese benefit \nfrom economic growth. Specific mention is made in the CPRGS about the need to improve and \nstabilize the living standards of ethnic minorities in a manner that is compatible with their \ncustoms. The Government\u2019s Forest Development Strategy (2001\u20132010) and sector plans call \nfor  making  forestry  an  important  economic  sector  by  (i)  protecting  and  developing  forest \nresources and increasing forest cover from 32% to 43% by 2010, (ii) achieving an annual \ngrowth  rate  in  the  forestry  sector  of  over  3.5%  during  2006\u20132010,  (iii)  accelerating  and \ncompleting forestland allocation under the Land Law and the revised forest protection and \ndevelopment law; (iv) using forestry to improve livelihoods and reduce poverty in chronically \npoor mountainous and ethnic minority\u2013dominated areas, and (iv) increasing the efficiency and \nvalue of the country\u2019s wood-processing industry. \n2.  Recent poverty assessments highlighted that progress in poverty reduction has been \nslow in the Central Highlands, where significant numbers of ethnic minorities live. This finding \npoints out the requirement for continued targeted investment for poverty reduction in this area. \nForestry remains the major potential economic activity in the Central Highlands. In the overall \npolicy framework of poverty reduction, a sub-objective exists to increase the share of benefits to \nhouseholds involved in forest protection, forest management, and reforestation. Implementation \nof this benefit-sharing policy lags behind expectations due to a number of constraints. The \nemphasis on socially inclusive development and a geographic focus on the central region in the \ncountry strategy and program of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) further justify the proposed \ninvestments under this Project. \n3.  The forestry sector in Viet Nam is mainly concerned with forest-resource protection and \nmanagement and the associated harvesting of timber, mainly from natural forests. Available \ninformation indicates an annual wood deficit of around 5\u20136 million cubic meters (m3) roundwood \nequivalent. The Government's drive to expand the economy includes promoting exports of wood \nproducts, particularly wooden furniture. The value of wood exports was $530 million in 2002 and \nincreased to about $1.5 billion in 2005. Most of the wood inputs for the processing industry \ncome from imports and illegal sources. The Central Highlands region is the most important in \nViet Nam for forestry, as it has almost 30% of the country\u2019s total forest area and contributes \nmore than 60% of the total hardwood supplies from natural forests. The region also assumes \nunique significance in view of its including biodiversity hotspots and important watersheds. \nThere are currently about 3.17 million hectares (ha) of forestland in the Central Highland, \nincluding about 3.03 million ha of natural forest and 0.14 million ha of forest plantations. The \nProject proposes to establish scientifically sound management regimes for these forestlands in \nthe central region. It will undertake forest resource development and management activities \nsupported by capacity development and project management support. It will also undertake \nrural infrastructure improvement to ensure that all the necessary types of capital are in place to \nmake investment in the sector effective. \n4.  The proposed Project will address a number of market and other failures. First and \nforemost,  it  will  remedy  the  issue  of  forestland  tenure  rights.  The  existing  land  tenure  of \nforestlands in the Central Highlands does not provide adequate incentive for investment, nor \ndoes it guarantee benefits accruing to the local communities. Despite the availability of vast \nforest resources in the region, the current contribution of forestry to household income remains \n ", "Appendix 11  55 \nvery low at less than 5%. Forestland definition, delineation, demarcation, and allocation will \nprovide well-defined property right to forestlands. These activities will generate substantial rural \nemployment opportunities. The proposed Project will augment tree cover, rehabilitating and \nrestoring  natural  forests  in  sensitive  ecosystems  and  reversing  forest  degradation.  These \nactivities will internalize the environmental externalities associated with forestland degradation. \nThat project area is a nationally important watershed signifies the correction of this market \nfailure. The enhanced management of natural forest will augment the supply of environmentally \nrelated public goods. The project will also address the information coordination failures, which \nprevent private sector investment in the forestry sector, by identifying suitable forestlands and \nmaking this information available to the private sector. It will also address the capacity and \ntechnological  failures  of  the  Government  that  result  in  unproductive  and  economically \nunattractive forestry activities in the vast forestlands of the Central Highlands. \nB.  Project Benefits \n5.  Poverty  Reduction.  The  project directly  and  indirectly  helps  reduce  poverty  in  the \nCentral Highlands. It will directly address poverty through its assistance regarding fast-growing \ntree species using an equity model. In the first round of livelihood plantations, 5,200 households \nwill be permanently lifted out of poverty by project investments. A financing mechanism will be \ninstitutionalized  by  establishing  commune  development  funds  to  scale  up  the  livelihood \nplantation model. After the first harvest, a similar number of households will be supported to \nestablish livelihood plantations. The project will provide a lot of employment (23 million person-\ndays) covering 80,000 households in the targeted local communities through its forestland \nmanagement planning activities. In addition, the vibrant forestry sector envisaged by the Project \nis expected to generate a variety of secondary economic opportunities for local communities. \n6.  Natural Forest Management. The Project will arrest forest degradation and develop \nand  implement  sustainable  forest  management  plans  for  about  1.5  million  ha  of  natural \nproduction forestlands in the Central Highlands. Employing certain plausible assumptions, with- \nand without-project revenue streams from sustainable timber harvesting were calculated. The \ntotal forest stock under the project management regimes is expected to increase significantly as \n(i) the forest area stabilizes at the baseline area and (ii) the stock is allowed to grow under \ninitially low rates of harvesting. The predicted yield difference with and without the project was \nvalued at $40/m3. The stumpage value of hardwood timber was taken at $76/m3, and $36 was \ndeducted from this stumpage to account for the cost of state forest enterprise (SFE) forest \nmanagement over and above the direct project investment. Incremental wood yield due to \nproposed  better  management  will  generate  $44  million  worth  of  net  present  value  for  the \nGovernment at a 10% discount rate. \n7.  Plantation  Forestry.  The  Project  will  support  establishing  44,000  ha  of  forest \nplantations,  30,000  ha  by  small  holders,  9,550  ha  by  SFEs,  and  5,200  ha  by  small-  and \nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The livelihood plantation is supported through an equity \nmodel.1 The bulk of project investments, $21 million (over 26%), are allocated for this activity. A \nnumber of fast-growing plantation models were developed and subjected to financial analysis. \nThe results indicate that returns are attractive for fast-growing species on short rotations, with \nfinancial internal rates of return (FIRRs) of 12\u201317%. Models based on longer rotations have \nFIRRs of 9\u201315%. All plantation models are moderately sensitive to the cost of labor, which \nconstitutes a significant proportion of the cost of plantation establishment. Short rotation models \nare also sensitive to the output price of wood. All models show significantly better returns than \n                                                 \n1  See Supplementary Appendix H for details. \n ", "56  Appendix 11 \nthose  earned  from  comparable  models  based  upon  existing  activities  and  cost  and  price \nparameters, for which FIRRs are 2\u201311%. The analyses thus show that the proposed Project will \ngenerate adequate financial incentive for smallholders, SFEs, and SMEs to engage in forest \nplantation.  Moreover,  the  analyses  show  that  the  Project  has  potential  for  significantly \nimprovements over the baseline situation. The weighted average cost of capital for the Project \nwas estimated to be 4.6, and the indicative FIRR values of revenue-generating components are \nmuch  above  that  figure.  This  clearly  demonstrates  the  financial  viability  of  the  revenue-\ngenerating components of the Project. \n \n8.  The plantation component of the proposed Project is expected to generate over 2 million \nm3 of pulpwood and 72,500 m3 of saw logs during the first 8 year rotation. In addition, if the \nprojected area of 6,850 ha of indigenous hardwoods and 2,700 ha of enrichment planting goes \nto a full rotation of 40 years, around 1.5 million m3 of hardwood timber will become available in \nthe future. The smallholder labor contribution to the project is expected to amount to 6.5 million \nperson-days over 8 years, and SFEs and SMEs are expected to require 1.6 million person-days \nof input from workers in their areas. At current wage rates, this is valued at almost D32 billion \n($2 million). Much of this demand for labor is likely to be met by poor households. \n \n9.  If the anticipate private sector investment materializes, forest plantations are expected to \nexpand by about 50,000 ha per year over a decade, beginning from 2010. This expectation is \nconsistent with the target in the National Forestry Development Strategy and demand for wood \nas an industrial raw material. The plantations will take about 10 years to come into production \nand start to generating revenue, allowing a few years to begin investment, complete land \nallocation,  and  attract  private  investment.  With  a  conservatively  estimated  yield  of  about \n15m3/ha/year, annual government revenue would be around $6 million. This is based on a 4% \nnatural resources tax and a log value of $20 per m3. The present value of future annual income \nof  $6  million,  starting  in  10  years  time  at  10%  discount,  is  around  $20  million,  which  is \nsubstantially more than the proposed investment in sector strengthening. \n \n10.  Economic Feasibility of Core Subproject. One of the core subprojects, the Lam Dong \ncore  subproject,  was  subjected  to  economic  analysis.  Timber  benefits  from  natural  forest \nmanagement  and  forest  plantations  and  non-timber  forest  product  (NTFP)  benefits  were \nquantified. Among the environmental benefits, watershed protection benefits were assessed \nusing  benefit-transfer  methods.  Only  conservative  environmental  values  were  used  in \ncalculations. Appropriate conversion factors were used to convert financial costs and benefits to \neconomic costs and benefits. The analysis shows an economic internal rate of return of 14%, \nindicating that the overall project generates benefits in excess of costs. As the Lam Dong \nsubproject is representative, this analysis is indicative of the economic feasibility of the entire \nProject. \n \n11.  Environmental Benefits. The Project will define, allocate, and enhance management of \n1  million  ha  of  special-use  and  protected  forests,  mostly  in  important  watershed  areas. \nWatersheds provide many environmental services such as smoothing flows for flood protection \nand  the  provision  of  dry  season  water  flows,  as  well  as  water  filtration  and  protection. \nWatersheds  also  support  downstream  economic  activities  such  as  fisheries  by  protecting \nhabitats and nursery grounds, as well as water-supply schemes. Very conservative assumptions \non benefits from NTFPs and such environmental services as preventing soil erosion generate \nbenefits worth $5 million per annum. The present value of this benefit stream, at 10% discount \nrate for 40 years, is about $49 million, far exceeding expenditure. The ecological importance of \nthe natural forests for conserving biodiversity, the extent to which the water resources are used \n ", "Appendix 11  57 \nfor hydro-power generation and irrigation, and the negative impact of flood damage would \nsuggest a much higher economic value. \nC.  Financial Sustainability \n12.  Sustainability of financing for livelihood plantation has been guaranteed by the proposed \nequity  model.  While  contributing  to  poverty  reduction  significantly,  commune  development \nfunds, created to finance this component, recover adequate funds (30% of revenue) to allow \nrepeating  support  for  other  farmers.  Revenue  from  sustainable  natural  production  forest \nmanagement  and  natural  resource  taxes  from  plantation  activities  will  generate  adequate \nrevenues for the Government to repay the loan and continue to support the forest management \nregimes put in place by the Project. Tax revenues (the 4% natural resources tax) from natural \nand plantation forestry components will be $1.86 million in 2006\u20132010 and $2 million in 2011\u2013\n2015. Fiscal affordability analysis shows that the revenue stream from the natural resource tax \nalone is adequate to repay the loan. If private sector development takes place as envisaged, it \nwill generate an additional $6 million in annual Government revenues. The expected expansion \nof the forestry sector will lead to parallel expansion of processing activities. The Government \ncharges 22% percent sales tax on processed wood products. The incremental increase in sales \ntax due to project intervention will be substantial. These extra revenues, which come at the later \npart of project implementation, and surplus from the natural resource tax after paying the debt \nservices, is more than adequate to sustain financial support for forestry sector activities after the \nproject implementation period. \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20061102115022+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20061004111435+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - RRP FLITCH final_4Oct.doc", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "ZBO", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)"}}
