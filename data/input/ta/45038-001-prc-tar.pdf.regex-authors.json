INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  During  the  country  programming  mission  in  2010,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested capacity development technical assistance (TA) for carbon \nmarket development in Tianjin.1 It was agreed with the Tianjin municipal government (TMG) and \nthe Ministry of Finance that the scope of the TA would be to develop the pilot Tianjin emission \ntrading system (TETS) and the associated market infrastructure. Based on this understanding, \nthe name of the TA was changed to Developing Tianjin Emission Trading System and the \nconcept paper for the TA was approved on 21 October 2011.2 \n \n2.  During the TA fact-finding, an agreement was reached on the overall design, impact, \noutcome, and outputs of the TA; and the outline terms of reference for consultants, including the \nimplementation  arrangements,  cost  details,  and financing  plan. The design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  During the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, 2006\u20132010, the PRC achieved a reduction of about \n19.1% in the energy intensity of its economy.3 Since it relies heavily on coal, the energy intensity \nreduction in the PRC proportionately reduced carbon emissions. The energy intensity reduction \nrecorded in the eleventh plan was accompanied by an increase in the share of non-fossil fuel \nsources of energy (i.e., renewable and nuclear) and low-carbon fossil fuel (i.e., natural gas). \nThis energy intensity reduction was achieved primarily through a set of administrative measures \nthat included (i) targeted energy efficiency improvement in the country\u2019s largest energy-intensive \nindustries, (ii) incentives for energy efficiency improvements for bulk users, and (iii) phasing out \nof obsolete and inefficient industrial capacity.  \n \n4.  The PRC has committed to reduce its carbon intensity by 40%\u201345% in 2020 compared \nwith 2005 and to increase the share of non-fossil fuel in the primary energy supply to 15% by \n2020. 4 In line with this, the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015 has set targets for reduction in \nenergy intensity (16%) and carbon intensity (17%) by 2015 compared with 2010 and to increase \nthe non-fossil contribution in primary energy supply to 11.8% by 2015 compared with 8.6% in \n2010. In addition, the twelfth plan set specific targets to improve the urban air quality through \nemission reduction as the urban areas of the PRC are suffering from poor air quality.  \n \n5.  While administrative measures achieved substantial energy efficiency savings during the \neleventh plan, these measures need to be complemented by more market-oriented approaches \nto provide economic incentives for emission reduction. One such approach is to enable the \ntrading of emission reductions between enterprises that have obligations for emission reduction. \nThis would provide incentives for emission reduction to be achieved in economic sectors that \nhave the least cost for emission reduction. The government has proposed to pilot test cap-and-\ntrade of carbon dioxide emissions in selected industry sectors and regions during the twelfth \nplan by establishing provincial emission trading systems (ETSs). The carbon dioxide trading can \nalso provide co-benefits such as reduction in local pollutants. This would improve the urban air \n                                                \n1  The TA was included as Supporting Domestic Carbon Market in the PRC in the country operations business plan. \nADB. 2011. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2011\u20132013. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) website on 14 \nNovember 2011. \n3  Energy intensity is a measure of the energy efficiency of a nation\u2019s economy. It is calculated as units of energy per \nunit of gross domestic product. \n4  Carbon intensity is the amount of carbon dioxide equivalent emitted per unit of gross domestic product. \n ", "2   \nquality and will result in indirect socioeconomic benefits in terms of reduction in respiratory \ndiseases.  \n \n6.  The emission trading markets have evolved since 2005 in many developed countries \nwith mixed results. The evolving emission trading markets can be broadly classified into cap-\nand-trade5 and  baseline  and  credit  markets.6 Both  of  these  market  structures  transform \nemission savings into a tradable commodity. When the market participants voluntarily set a cap \non their emissions, it is referred to as a voluntary cap-and-trade market, and when a regulator \nsets a cap on emission from certain economic sectors, it is referred to as a mandatory cap-and-\ntrade market. A cap-and-trade-based market is usually referred to as ETS; the European ETS is \nthe best known mandatory cap-and-trade market.  \n \n7.  The  baseline  and  credit  and  cap-and-trade  markets  can  be  linked  through  offset \nmechanisms. In offsetting, credits generated through baseline and credit markets, in economic \nsectors or regions not covered in the cap-and-trade market, are used to offset emissions within \nthe capped regions. The cap-and-trade market regulators usually stipulate the type and quantity \nof offsets that can be used in lieu of emission allowances. The European ETS (i.e., cap-and-\ntrade  market)  accepts  the  certified  emission  reductions  under  the  Clean  Development \nMechanism (i.e., baseline and credit market) as an offset subject to certain limitations.  \n \n8.  Given  the  complexities  and  potential  economic  impacts  of  emission  trading,  the \ngovernment has decided to pilot test cap-and-trade-based emission trading at the provincial \nlevel. This would enable useful lessons to be learned on the challenges of designing a national \nETS in a rapidly growing developing economy, as international experience, with respect to \nemission trading, is limited to more mature moderately growing economies.  \n \n9.  Tianjin had been designated a low-carbon city by the government, and has been invited \nby the National Development and Reform Commission to submit proposals for establishing a \npilot ETS (other cities and provinces that were identified for pilot testing ETS are Beijing and \nShanghai, Chongqing municipalities, Guangdong and Hubei provinces). TMG has approved the \noverall plan for establishing the Tianjin emission trading market and formally submitted the \nproposal to establish a pilot cap-and-trade-based TETS in August 2011. It was proposed that \nthe (i) feasibility study for emission trading would be approved by the National Development and \nReform Commission before the end of 2011, (ii) pre-conditions for emission trading would be \nestablished by the end of 2012, and (iii) TETS would commence operations in 2013. This would \nenable the government authorities to gather useful lessons from the TETS to be incorporated in \nthe national ETS, which is expected to be established in 2015. \n \n10.  As a first step toward establishing a carbon market in Tianjin, TMG, in collaboration with \nPetro China, established the Tianjin Climate Exchange (TCX) in 2008. TCX has undertaken \n                                                \n5  A cap-and-trade market is created when the market participants within a certain jurisdiction receive an overall cap \non the emissions they can emit over the trading period. The individual market participants receive an emission \nallowance that would contribute to the overall cap on emissions. The market participants need to match their actual \nemissions with the emission allowances possessed by them at the end of trading period. The cap-and-trade market \nenables the market participants to trade the emission allowances among each other if the actual emissions exceed \nor fall short of their allowance. \n6 In the baseline and credit markets, the carbon credits are defined as the difference in emissions between \nemissions after mitigations measures in comparison to the baseline (i.e., the emissions trajectory under the \nbusiness-as-usual scenario). Well-defined standards and methodologies are required for quantifying the emission \nreduction from mitigation measures and institutional arrangements for measuring, validating, and issuing emission \nreductions  in  baseline  and  credit  markets.  The  Clean  Development  Mechanism  under  the  United  Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change is the most well-known example of baseline and credit market. ", "3 \nseveral  pioneering  initiatives  and  research  studies  on  carbon  markets.  These  include \n(i) structuring carbon neutrality products, (ii) attempting to establish a voluntary emission trading \nmechanism  among  several  industrial  establishments,  (iii)  establishing  an  electronic  trading \nplatform for major pollutants (sulfur dioxide), and (iv) conceptualizing the reduction of energy \nintensity in civil building sector using market-based approaches.  \n \n11.  TMG, in consultation with the government, will have to decide several key strategic \nissues prior to establishing the TETS. These include the following:  \n(i)  Whether the emission trading system would be based on intensity-based \ntargets or absolute targets? Although the intensity-based target is consistent \nwith the stated pledge of the PRC for emission reduction, the monitoring and \nverification requirements are more complex for intensity-based ETS. \n(ii)  How  the  emission  trading  system  interacts  with  other  administrative \npolicies  aimed  at  reducing  carbon  and  energy  intensity?  These  include \nenergy  conservation  performance targets for key  enterprises,  phasing  out  of \nobsolete  technologies  and  industrial  capacities,  and  fiscal  incentives  and \npenalties for inefficient industries. The ETS should be designed to complement \nthese policies. \n(iii)  Sector scope of the emission trading system. The economic sectors to be \nincluded in the ETS need to be decided based on the (a) likely economic impact \nof emission caps on the sector, including competitiveness; (b) ability of the sector \nto  reduce  emissions  through  technological  innovation;  (c)  contribution  of  the \nsector to the overall emissions in the province; (d) feasibility of implementing \nmeasurements and verification of emissions of the sector; and (e) readiness of \nsector entities to participate in the ETS. \n(iv)  Determination of the emission target. The amount of emission reduction to be \nachieved and the cost of compliance for the participants need to be examined. A \nstringent target would have more severe economic implications, including carbon \nleakage to provinces with less stringent emission requirements. \n(v)  Price control mechanisms. It is necessary to decide whether to allow flexible \ncaps or other forms of safety valves, such as additional emission allowances, if \nthe market price exceeds a predefined level.  \n(vi)  Allocation methodology of allowances. The emission allocation methodology \nneeds to be determined at the outset. Free allocation wins the support of market \nparticipants,  but  it  may  result  in  windfall  profits,  while  the  auctioning  of \nallowances would provide a more market-oriented allocation of allowances.  \n(vii)  Offsets and linkages with other markets, including voluntary markets. The \noffsets provide an avenue to link the proposed ETS with the voluntary market for \ndomestically issued verified emission reduction. The linkages with other ETS in \nthe PRC would enable emission allowances to be traded across several ETSs \nand therefore increase the market liquidity. The types and amount of offsets to be \nallowed need to be determined as part of the design of the TETS.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The impact will be the establishment of a national cap-and-trade-based ETS in the PRC \nto contribute to emission reduction. The national ETS is expected to provide adequate market-\nbased price signals for emission reduction and play a key role in reducing the carbon intensity of \nthe PRC\u2019s economy. The outcome will be successfully pilot testing the TETS to provide useful ", "4   \nlessons for the establishment of a national ETS. The TETS will also provide market-based \nincentives for emission reduction to enterprises from economic sectors covered in the TETS.  \n   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The TA is expected to deliver the following outputs.  \n \n14.  Output 1: Provide strategic policy advice on the overall design of the Tianjin \nemission trading system. The TA consultants will undertake an analytical study of the key \npolicy and strategic issues pertaining to the design of an ETS, such as: (i) identifying the key \ncriteria for the different economic sectors to be included in the ETS, (ii) setting the level of \nemission  cap  for  the  economic  sectors  included  in  the  ETS,  and  (iii)  examining  how  the \nemission allowances should be allocated to market participant. The TA consultants will take into \naccount the experience and lessons from ETSs established in other parts of the world. The TA \nconsultants will also undertake econometric modeling to ascertain the economic impacts of the \nintroduction of ETS and to estimate the financial impacts on market participants.  \n \n15.  Output  2:  Prepare  detailed  design  of  the  Tianjin  emission  trading  system, \nincluding the trading rules and regulatory systems. Upon finalization of the broad design \nparameters of the TETS by the policy makers, the TA consultants will undertake detailed design \nof the ETS, including trading rules such as eligibility of offsets, price control mechanism and \nmonitoring, and verification protocols for settlement of emission allowances. This will include \nrecommendations on institutional and legal frameworks for market regulation.  \n \n16.  Output 3: Commission the trading platform and registry for the Tianjin emission \ntrading system. The consultant will prepare detailed technical specifications for the trading \nplatform and registry, for recording the property rights of emission allowances held by market \nparticipants. Based on the specifications prepared, the TA consultants will assist the TCX in \nprocuring and developing the hardware and software systems required for the trading platform \nand registry from third parties and software vendors.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000 equivalent,7 of which (i) $200,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF\u2014other sources) and (ii) $550,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Climate \nChange Fund.8 TMG, through the implementing agency, will provide in-kind contribution in the \nform of office accommodation, logistic facilities, and remuneration of counterpart staff. The \ndetailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  Tianjin  Finance  Bureau  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  TA.  TCX  will  be  the \nimplementing agency. The TA will commence on 15 March 2012 and will be completed on \n31 December 2013. The TA consultants will work under the guidance of the leading group \nappointed by TMG to establish the TETS under the leadership of Tianjin Development and \nReform Commission. The TA will be carried out by a team of international (6 person-months) \nand national consultants (18 person-months) having extensive knowledge and expertise in \n                                                \n7  This includes the software and hardware systems required for trading platform and registry. \n8  Established by ADB.

The detailed tasks under this output include the following: \n(i)  Providing in-depth review of existing and planned ETSs in Australia, Canada, \nEurope, Japan, New Zealand, and the United States. Based on this, draw useful \nlessons relevant to the design of Tianjin ETS (TETS), taking into account the \nspecific circumstances of the PRC and Tianjin. \n(ii)  Reviewing ongoing progress and system choices made, related to ETSs (policy \nand practices), including but not limited to the six ETS pilot provinces and cities \nof Beijing, Chongqing, Guangdong, Hubei, Shanghai, and Tianjin, as well as the \nguidelines provided by the Government of the PRC for establishing pilot ETSs. \n(iii)  Reviewing the energy and climate policies and targets under the Twelfth Five-\nYear Plan, 2011\u20132015 and other related policies in Tianjin, analyze the impact of \nemission trading on existing policies, and estimate the cost of compliance with \nemission reduction targets with and without emission trading for key economic \nsectors.  \n(iv)  Analyzing these existing or planned climate and energy policies at national and \nsubnational levels regarding their likely interactions with ETSs. \n(v)  Preparing a policy paper addressing the following issues: \n(a)  How to translate the intensity-based emission targets of the PRC to an \nabsolute emission cap for the purpose of trading? \n(b)  How  emission  trading  systems  interact  with  other  administrative \npolicies  aimed  at  reducing  carbon  and  energy  intensity?  These \ninclude  energy  conservation  performance  targets  for  key  enterprises, \nphasing out of obsolete technologies and industrial capacities, and fiscal \nincentives  and  penalties for  inefficient  industries. The  ETS  should  be \ndesigned to complement these policies. \n(c)  Sector scope of the emission trading system. The economic sectors \nto be included in the ETS need to be decided based on the (i) likely \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \neconomic  impact  of  emission  caps  on  the  sector,  including \ncompetitiveness;  (ii)  ability  of  the  sector to  reduce  emissions through \ntechnological  innovation;  (iii)  contribution  of  the  sector  to  the  overall \nemissions in the province; (iv) feasibility of implementing, measuring, and \nverifying emissions of the sector; and (v) preparedness of sector entities \nto participate in the ETS. \n(d)  Determination  of  the  emission  target.  This  would  determine  the \namount of emission reduction to be achieved and the cost of compliance \nfor the participants. A more stringent target would also have more severe \neconomic implications, including carbon leakage to provinces with less \nstringent emission requirements. \n(vi)  Undertaking econometric modeling to assess the likely economic impact of the \nproposed ETS on economic sectors to be covered in the ETS. Based on the \nmodeling, it will undertake the following: \n(a)  Propose the emission caps to be set and the likely emission allowance \nprices. \n(b)  Given  the  announced  national  and  regional  targets,  analyze  the \nstringency of the targets in terms of abatement cost for different sectors \nand regions that might be covered by the ETS.   \n(c)  Identify  key  challenges  and  opportunities  and  analyze  the  risks  and \neffects of carbon leakage. \n \n2.  Output 2: Prepare Detailed Design of the Tianjin Emission Trading System, \nincluding the Trading Rules and Regulatory Systems \n \n4.  This task will be undertaken by an ETS expert (international, 2.5 person-months), carbon \nmarket expert (national, 4 person-months), and market regulation expert (national, 4 person-\nmonths). The detailed tasks under this output include: \n(i)  Undertaking structured consultations with the market participants to obtain their \nviews on the design aspects of the TETS. \n(ii)  Proposing the necessary legal and policy framework, including draft decrees, to \nenable the establishment of TETS. \n(iii)  Proposing institutional arrangements for market regulation, taking into account \nthe existing arrangements for financial market regulation in Tianjin. \n(iv)  Proposing procedures for issuing emission allowances to the participants of the \nETS and managing the allocation of emission allowances to market participants. \n(v)  Proposing the monitoring and verification procedures and protocols for the ETS \nsystem  and  making  recommendation  for  capacity  building  of  third-party \nverification agencies.  \n(vi)  Making recommendations on whether to allow flexible caps or other forms of \nsafety  valves,  such  as  additional  emission  allowances,  if  the  market  price \nexceeds a predefined level.  \n(vii)  Making recommendations regarding the length of the trading period, taking into \naccount the time frames for pilot testing of the TETS. \n(viii)  Making recommendations regarding the allocation methodology of allowances.1  \n(ix)  Making recommendations regarding the eligibility of offsets and linkages with \nother markets, including voluntary markets. The offsets provide an avenue to link \nthe proposed ETS with the voluntary market for domestically issued voluntary \n                                                \n1  While free allocation wins the support of market participants, it may result in windfall profits, while auctioning of \nallowances would provide more market-oriented allocation of allowances. ", "Appendix 3  11 \nemission  reductions.  Linkages  with  other  ETSs  in  the  PRC  would  enable \nemission allowances to be traded across several ETSs and increase the market \nliquidity. \n(x)  Proposing how the property rights for emission allowances would be recorded \nand how they would be retired at the end of the trading period. \n(xi)  Undertaking information dissemination.  \n \n3.
