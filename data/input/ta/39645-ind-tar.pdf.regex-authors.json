The Government of India (Government) has undertaken several initiatives to encourage \nsustainable urban development in the country, including the recent declaration of a national \nincentive-linked fund, the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM). The \nJNNURM  is  expected  to  invest  approximately  $11  billion  equivalent  for  urban  infrastructure \ndevelopment in 63 of the largest cities in India. The Ministry of Urban Development (MUD) has \nbeen designated as Executing Agency (EA) for the infrastructure and governance component of \nthe  JNNURM.1 The  Government  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  to  the  MUD  Mission  Directorate  to  successfully  implement  the \nJNNURM.2  \n \n2.  The ADB Mission visited India on 6\u201313 December to discuss with the Government the \nproposed TA. The Mission met with MUD and the Department of Economic Affairs, and also held \na workshop with senior MUD officials to develop the scope, implementation arrangements, terms \nof reference for consulting services, and financing arrangements of the TA. The project design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  According to India\u2019s 2001 population census, more than 285 million people (27.8% of the \ntotal population) live in urban areas. With this large base, which is growing at the rate of around \n2.7% annually, India has the world\u2019s second largest urban population. Given the current trends in \npopulation growth and migration, India\u2019s urban population is estimated to reach 575 million by \n2030.3 The importance of India\u2019s urban sector is indisputable. The urban sector contribution to \nIndia\u2019s net domestic product is estimated to be 50\u201352%. In India, 64.7%  of employment in trade, \ncommerce, and financial services; 65% in manufacturing; and 68% in the transport sector are \nconcentrated in urban areas.4  \n \n4.  Despite the significance of India\u2019s urban sector, however, India\u2019s cities are characterized \nby widespread poverty, inadequate urban infrastructure, and environmental degradation. The \n2001 population census found that although 91% of India\u2019s urban dwellers had access to drinking \nwater,  only 49.7% of households had tap water on their premises. Similarly, only 57.4% of urban \nhouseholds had sanitation facilities on their premises. It must be noted that existence of the \nservice does not imply its adequacy or quality, so the effective situation may be worse. Slums, \nanother highly visible manifestation of urban poverty, housed approximately 40 million people, \nrepresenting around 14.12% of the total urban population in India in 2001. Urban poverty in urban \nareas  has  declined  from  52%  in  1972\u20131973  to  23.6%  in  1999\u20132000,  but  this  percentage \nrepresents  65  million  people  who  live  in  absolute  poverty.5 Poor  urban  development  and \nmanagement is not only undermining India\u2019s ability to deliver quality of life to its citizens, but also \nconstraining potential local and national economic growth. The need for a strong focus and \naccelerated investment in urban development is clear. \n                                                 \n1  MUD, Government of India, has been designated as Executing Agency (EA) for the \u201cinfrastructure and governance\u201d \nsubcomponent under the JNNURM, and the Ministry of Urban Employment and Poverty Alleviation has been \ndesignated EA for the \u201cbasic services to the poor\u201d subcomponent. Both ministries will be setting up their own mission \ndirectorates.  \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 3 January 2006. \n3  United Nations. 2002.

In recognition of the critical importance of rapid urban development, India\u2019s Prime Minister \nlaunched the JNNURM on 3 December 2005.6 The JNNURM is a \u201creforms driven, fast track, \nplanned development of identified cities with focus on efficiency in urban infrastructure/services \ndelivery  mechanism,  community  participation  and  accountability  of  Urban  Local \nBodies/Parastatals towards citizens.\u201d7 The JNNURM will be for 7 years, starting in 2005\u20132006, \nand includes a central outlay of approximately $11 billion.8 Sixty-three cities are designated as \neligible  for  investments  through  the  JNNURM.  Each  city  will  enter  into  a  memorandum  of \nagreement (MOA) with the Government and the parent state and commit itself to a range of \nmandatory and optional reforms related to urban governance. City development plans (CDPs) will \nbe developed. They will consider each city\u2019s unique needs in an integrated and participatory \nmanner, and prioritize investments that need to be made during the JNNURM period and beyond. \nFrom the prioritization in the CDPs, the cities will prepare detailed project reports (DPRs) for \ninvestments seeking JNNURM funding. Funding for physical improvements will be based on an \nappraisal  of  the  DPRs.  Five  percent  of  the  overall  JNNURM  funding  will  finance  consulting \nservices and technical assistance to urban local bodies (ULBs) and state governments to prepare \ntheir CDPs and DPRs. The JNNURM will finance, on a grant basis, between 35% and 90% of the \ncosts associated with urban infrastructure investments, depending on the classification of the \ncity.9 Part  of  the  remaining  financing  will  be  provided  through  state  governments,  and  the \nremainder is expected to be financed through external funding agencies, the private sector, and \nIndia\u2019s capital market.  \n \n6.  MUD has been designated as the ministry to launch the JNNURM; it will also be the EA for \nthe infrastructure and governance subcomponent under the JNNURM. The Ministry of Urban \nEmployment and Poverty Alleviation has been designated as EA for the basic services to the poor \nsubcomponent. The Government of India is in the process of establishing a Mission Directorate \nwithin MUD to spearhead all efforts under the infrastructure and governance component of the \nJNNURM.  \n \n7.  While significant staff are being assigned to the Mission Directorate,10 their capacity to \nindependently manage and implement the complex array of tasks associated with the JNNURM, \nespecially in the initial stages where many of the technical details and procedures need to be \nrefined,  is of  concern.  Guidelines  for  developing  and  appraising  CDPs  and  DPRs,  although \noutlined, need significant refinement to ensure that JNNURM resources are allocated efficiently \nand transparently. Systems to track JNNURM funding commitments and expected project cash \nflows, and monitor individual project indicators and overall JNNURM performance need to be put \nin place. Significant support is also needed to enable MUD to effectively guide state and city \ngovernments through the process of defining individual reform agendas; preparing CDPs, DPRs, \nand other reports necessary to access JNNURM funds; attracting private sector participation in \nthe development efforts; and setting up means to transparently account for and monitor individual \nproject investments among others. The proposed TA is designed to provide MUD with the support \nit needs to ensure effective ramping up and implementation of the JNNURM, and transfer of \nknowledge to MUD staff for efficient management of the JNNURM.  \n \n                                                 \n6  The Cabinet approved the JNNURM on 17 November 2005. \n7  JNNURM mission statement, guidelines for JNNURM, Government of India, December 2005. \n8  An equal amount would be contributed by the states as well. The total outlay is for Rs100,000 crores, (1 crore=Rs10 \nmillion). \n9  Financing will be 35% for cities with 4 million population and over, 50% for cities between 1 and 4 million population, \n90% for cities in northeastern states and Jammu and Kashmir, and 80% for select cities other than those included  \nabove.  \n10 See implementation arrangements. \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The proposed TA will provide technical assistance to the MUD Mission Directorate for \neffective implementation of the JNNURM and technical support to ULBs for accessing JNNURM \nfunds. The underlying goal of the TA is to leverage and mobilize the substantial resources \nallocated by the Government for urban development through the JNNURM, and to help ensure \nmaximum impact of the program in terms of reforms at the state and local level,11 as well as in \nterms of physical development of urban infrastructure. As such, the primary impact of the TA will \nbe  the  effective  management  and  disbursement  of  JNNURM  funds,  significant  governance \nreforms at the state and ULB levels, efficient processing and implementation of JNNURM-funded \ninterventions at the ULB level, and overall improvement in the urban environment of India\u2019s major \ncities.  \n \n9.  The specific outcomes of the TA will be (i) a well-staffed project cell set up within MUD to \nhelp ramp up and implement the JNNURM effectively and efficiently; (ii) significantly enhanced \ncapacity of MUD to evaluate and appraise CDPs, DPRs, and related policy reforms; (iii) enhanced \ncapacity within MUD to provide technical and advisory support to state and ULB governments in \nimplementing and managing integrated urban development and governance reform programs \nfunded  through  the  JNNURM;  (iv)  increased  awareness  at  state  and  ULB  levels  about  the \nresources  available  through  the  JNNURM  and  the  procedures  to  access  such  funds;  (v) \nsignificantly  enhanced  reach  and  effectiveness  of  the  JNNURM  through  close  monitoring  of \noverall performance and technical support to ULB and state governments in implementing reforms \nand project interventions; (vi) decreased urban poverty due to improved urban infrastructure and \naccess to basic services in India\u2019s largest cities; and (vii) a significant increase in private sector \nparticipation in urban infrastructure development and management throughout India.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will primarily comprise consulting support to enable MUD to effectively manage \nand implement the JNNURM, and maximize its policy reform and urban development impacts. \nThe consulting team will form part of the project cell within the JNNURM Project Directorate at \nMUD, which will spearhead JNNURM implementation. Consulting inputs at the early stages of the \nTA will help MUD refine the guidelines and processes for project preparation, appraisal, and \nevaluation; and assist city and state governments in meeting such requirements. The TA will also \nassist MUD in setting up systems and procedures to monitor the progress of project, city, or state \ninvestments individually, and of the JNNURM as a whole. The consulting team will work closely \nwith  MUD  staff  assigned  to  the  JNNURM.  Significant  transfer  of  expertise  in  financial \nmanagement, project management, monitoring, and implementation to MUD over the TA period is \nexpected.  Key activities under the TA will include the following: \n(i)  Support the setup of the JNNURM project cell within the Project Directorate of MUD \nand assist MUD in the overall management and implementation of the JNNURM. \n(ii)  Assist  MUD  in  promoting  the  JNNURM  at  the  state  and  local  levels,  refine  the \nrequirements and guidelines for accessing funds, and provide close support to state \n                                                 \n11 A memorandum of agreement between each of the ULBs, states, and JNNURM will outline a series of required and \noptional reforms aimed at greater transparency and efficiency, and creating an enabling regulatory environment for \nprivate sector investment. The TA will support states/ULBs in defining their individual reform agendas, in managing \nassociated change processes, and in monitoring performance.  \n ", "4   \nand city governments at all stages in the process to ensure efficient disbursements \nand smooth implementation. \n(iii)  Conduct a baseline survey of the infrastructure and regulatory environments in ULBs \nslated for JNNURM investment, assist states and cities to define their reform agendas \nand to enter into MOAs with the Government, and monitor their progress over time. \n(iv)  Refine guidelines for preparing and appraising CDPs and DPRs, advise city and/or \nstate governments on CDP and DPR preparation requirements/methods, and build \nMUD capacity to check compliance, ensure quality, and evaluate the appraisals of \nCDPs and DPRs.  \n(v)  Monitor the progress of project and governance reform interventions funded through \nthe  JNNURM,  conduct  physical  and  financial  audits  of  projects  to  ensure  full \naccountability, and assist state and city governments to resolve any issues in project \nimplementation. \n(vi)  Create  a  management  information  system  (MIS)  that  will  allow  city  and  state \ngovernments  to  update  project  indicators  on-line  and  allow  MUD  to  track  overall \nperformance of the JNNURM, forecast funding requirements, and monitor individual \nproject performance efficiently. \n(vii)  Advise the cities in accessing other funds to supplement JNNURM grants, and ensure \nthat  the  JNNURM  catalyses  greater  investment  in  urban  infrastructure  from  other \nsources\u2014especially the private sector.  \n \n11.  Further details on the expertise to be provided through the TA and the specific tasks to be \ncarried out are included in the outline terms of reference for consulting services.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The total cost of \nthe TA is $2.5 million equivalent, comprising foreign exchange of $.005 million and local currency \nequivalent of $2.495 million. The entire foreign exchange cost and $1.995 million in local currency \nequivalent  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB.  The  Government  will  contribute  the \nremaining  local  currency  equivalent  of  $0.5  million  for  counterpart  staff  support,  office \naccommodation, facilities for meetings and workshops, and other administrative expenses. The \nGovernment will also provide all information and logistical support required for the TA activities. \nThe detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  MUD will be the EA and will be responsible for overall coordination of all TA activities. The \nconsultants will report directly to the designated mission director of the JNNURM who will be \nappointed by MUD. The Government will appoint counterpart staff12 to be part of the JNNURM \nproject cell, who will work directly with the TA consultants. The TA will be implemented over 3 \nyears beginning about March 2006. \n  \n                                                 \n12  Counterpart staff will include a mission director, three coordinators, three directors, two deputy secretaries, three \nundersecretaries, four section officers, four data entry officers, and three accounts officers.  \n ", "  5\n14.

A consulting firm will be engaged using the \nquality- and cost-based selection method and a simplified technical proposal, in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nselection and engagement of domestic consultants. The outline terms of reference for consulting \nservices is in Appendix 3. \n \n15.  The consultants will produce an inception report within 30 days of TA commencement. \nThe report will include a detailed work plan and implementation strategy for all TA activities. The \ninception report and work plan will be developed in close collaboration with MUD, and will also \nindicate a projected schedule of all workshops and training sessions to be conducted through the \nTA. Brief quarterly reports will be submitted, summarizing progress of the TA and the JNNURM, \nhighlighting any issues to be addressed. More detailed annual reports will document overall \nperformance of the TA and the JNNURM, milestones achieved, and constraints faced. A final \nreport due at the end of the TA will document the overall impacts achieved through the JNNURM \nand the effectiveness of the TA. During implementation, other reports or documents may be \nprepared by the consultants, as required, based on the needs of MUD or ADB.  \n \n16.  The  Government  will  provide  office  space,  furniture,  logistical  and  all  administrative \nsupport necessary to coordinate TA activities with state and city governments, as well as with \nother government agencies as required.
