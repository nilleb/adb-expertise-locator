During  the  2004  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) confirmed its request for technical assistance (TA) from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to assist the State Grid Corporation (SGC) to strengthen its system \nplanning capacity.1 In July 2004, a Fact-Finding Mission was fielded to assess the results of \navailable studies and determine the scope of the TA. The Mission held discussions with \nrepresentatives from the Government and SGC. An understanding was reached on the TA goals, \npurpose,  scope,  cost  estimates,  financing  and  implementation  arrangements,  and  the \nconsultants\u2019 terms of reference. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The PRC is the second largest electricity producer in the world after the United States. \nBy the end of 2003, the installed capacity was about 385 gigawatts and annual electricity \ngeneration was about 1,900 terawatt-hours. The PRC has experienced large power shortages \nand surpluses in its history. In the 1950s, demand and supply were in balance. In the 1960s, the \nPRC started to experience a long power shortage that reached more than 20% of capacity in \n1986. Demand and supply again reached balance in 1997, and by 1999, there was a power \nsurplus of about 10%. However,  power shortage has again become  serious in 2003, with \n21 provincial power grids experiencing power shortage.2 With about 8% to 8.5% gross domestic \nproduct growth, the power demand growth was as low as 2.8% in 1998 and as high as 15.4% in \n2003, depending on the fluctuating demand of power-intensive industries. Large surplus and \nshortage have created substantial costs to the economy and indicate weak capacity for power \nplanning. Small power shortage is manageable and cost of small surplus is acceptable to \nsupport stable growth. However, the past planning practices of chasing short-run fluctuations \nled to overreaction to shortage and surplus, and put the economy in situations of larger power \nsurplus and shortage. In a fast-growing economy with rapid power demand changes, it is \nimportant  to  have  effective  system  planning  to  accommodate  demand  fluctuations.  Good \nsystem planning will not eliminate surplus or shortage, but will reduce the chances of having \nlarge surplus and shortage, and therefore minimize the costs of both.  \n \n3.  Given the size of the PRC, good grid system planning is also important for improving \nsector efficiency. Large resources for power generation in the PRC are located far from major \nload  centers.  Coal  mines  are  in  the  north  and  northwestern  parts  of  the  country,  and \nhydropower resources are in the western parts, whereas the major load centers are in the \neastern and coastal areas. Regional and provincial interconnections are needed to transport \npower instead of fuel. Although rich in energy resources such as hydropower, gas, and coal, \nprovinces in the western region are the poorest in the PRC. The resources have only been \nexploited to a limited extent because of the low economic development in the western provinces \n(consequently limited local market), lack of capital, and poor infrastructure. To support economic \ndevelopment in the western provinces, facilities such as roads, pipelines, and transmission \ninterconnection are needed  to transport resources to markets in the east. However, power \nnetwork  development  has  not  kept  pace  with  generation  growth  due  to  the  low  level  of \ninvestment and barriers to interconnection. Inadequate transmission interconnection can create \na power imbalance, with surplus in some regions but shortage in others. The power networks \nneed to be improved to make possible power flow among provinces and regions, and to \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 24 July 2004. \n2  Overall, the power sector developed rapidly; it took 7 years for the installed capacity to increase from 100 gigawatts \n(GW) to 200 GW in 1994, and 5 years from 200 GW to 300 GW in 1999, and is expected to take less than 5 years \nto reach 400 GW by 2004. ", "2 \n \noptimize existing power generation. Network development requires effective system planning \nthat can optimize resources and ensure efficiency and sustainability. \n \n4.  In  December  2002,  the  former  State  Power  Corporation  (SP)  was  unbundled  and \nreorganized  into  two  new  grid  corporations:  (i)  SGC,  and  (ii)  China  Southern  Power  Grid \nCorporation, and five generation corporations, namely (a)  China  Huaneng  Group,  (b) China \nDatang  Corporation,  (c)  China  Huadian  Corporation,  (d)  China  Guodian  Corporation,  and \n(e) China Power Investment Corporation. Restructuring also established the State Electricity \nRegulatory Commission (SERC). SGC is now responsible for investment in and operation of the \npower network, and security and reliable operation of the power system except in five provinces \ncovered by  China Southern Power Grid Corporation.3 Earlier,  SP was responsible for both \ngeneration and grid system planning and expansion. Coordination and optimization of generation \nand grid system planning, and expansion could all be done within SP. In the newly restructured \nsector, SGC will have to develop new system planning procedures, criteria, and methodologies, \nand closely coordinate with generation companies to ensure timely grid system planning. \n \n5.  In  a  restructured  power  sector,  all  market  players  including  generators  and  grid \ncompanies, tend to maximize their own profits. Coordinated system planning (generation and \ngrid) to optimize overall power supply costs and system reliability requires new procedures, \ncriteria, and methodologies. In countries where the power sector was restructured, considerable \neffort was made by the government and the regulatory agency to (i) ensure new effective grid \nsystem planning procedures, criteria, and methodologies are in place, (ii) optimize generation \nand grid system planning, (iii) prevent major power shortage, and (iv) ensure system reliability. \nOtherwise, the cost savings of restructuring could not be realized and the system would be \nprone to major disturbances. The August 2003 massive power outage in the eastern grid of the \nUnited States that left millions of people without power for 2 days was attributable to inadequate \nplanning and upgrading of the power grids. As power markets in the PRC develop further and \npower trading opportunities increase, timely system planning for power grids will be essential to \nensure  effective  and  efficient  operation  of  the  power  markets.  More  power  trading  and \nexchanges among various power grids will in turn create more stress on the transmission \ninterconnection networks, and increase the possibility of major power disturbances. Therefore, \nSGC\u2019s role and responsibilities for grid planning and expansion in a restructured power sector \nare  more  challenging,  complicated,  and  demanding  than  those  in  the  previous  vertically \nintegrated power sector. System planning and efficient grid management in a restructured power \nsector require related capacity building for SGC. \n \n6.  The  rapid  growth  of  power  demand  and  high  dependence  on  coal  for  electricity \ngeneration have made environmental impact a matter of great concern to the PRC. The \nenvironmental  impact  from  thermal  power  generation  is  a  major  source  of  the  PRC\u2019s \nenvironmental  problem.4  Proper  grid  system  planning  will  result  in  transmission  of  more \neconomical and efficient power in one region or province to replace more costly and less \nefficient  power  in  other  regions  or  provinces.  More  efficient  power  plants  have  lower  air \nemissions.  Optimal  system  planning  will  also  reduce  transmission  congestion  and  energy \nlosses. Another key objective of SGC\u2019s system planning is to transport clean and renewable \nhydropower from western PRC to reduce the use of thermal power in eastern PRC. Improved \nsystem planning will optimize power resources, improve energy efficiency, and reduce air \nemissions.  System  planning  should  be  carried  out  taking  into  account  energy  efficiency, \ndemand-side management options, environmental protection, and clean energy development. \n                                                 \n3  The five provinces are Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hainan, and Yunnan. \n4  At present, at least 75% of the power generation capacity in the PRC uses fossil fuels, and power generation is \nresponsible for about 45% of air pollution. ", "    3 \n \n \n7.  SGC is making substantial efforts to  improve its network to  optimize existing power \ngeneration and accommodate future power generation development. ADB's operational strategy \nin the PRC is aimed at helping the country achieve economic growth in an efficient, equitable, \nand sustainable manner. ADB\u2019s energy sector strategy in the PRC includes (i) developing \ncleaner energy sources, (ii) renovating and retrofitting existing facilities to improve efficiency \nand  reduce  emissions,  (iii)  promoting  corporatization  and  commercialization  of  energy \nutilities, and (iv) pricing and tariff reforms. The current power shortage has encouraged a large \nincrease in generation capacity. However, power network development attracts lesser attention \nand could become \u201cbottlenecks\u201d of power supply if not improved in the next few years. SGC is \ncommitted to provide adequate, affordable, and cleaner electricity by improving power networks. \nThe TA is a major part of the effort. The TA, by strengthening grid system planning capacity, \nmaking a priority list of least-cost projects for the 11th Five-Year Plan (11FYP),5 and active \npolicy dialogue, is consistent with the Government\u2019s development objectives, and ADB\u2019s energy \nsector strategy. \n \n8.  ADB provided TA in 2000 to help SP optimize power generation through regional \ninterconnection  and  promote  substantial  power  development  by  formulating  a  regional \ntransmission  interconnection  strategy.6  That  TA  analyzed  the  key  barriers  to  interregional \nconnections, recommended reform measures, and developed an interregional transmission \nstrategy. Full implementation of the interregional transmission strategy will help resolve the \ncurrent energy imbalance and result in substantial savings of power supply costs (through \ntransport of cheaper power to the load centers, reduced reserve capacity requirements in the \ninterconnected power systems, and reduced environmental costs). To effectively implement the \nregional interconnection strategy, several areas of capacity building and further assistance were \nidentified, including a system planning to incorporate the strategy. The present TA will enable \nADB to assist in the implementation of the interconnection strategy, thus promoting economic \ngrowth of the western region and contributing to reducing poverty, addressing power shortages \nin the east and coastal regions, protecting the environment, and improving the quality of life of \nthe population. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n9.  The TA will help SGC improve  network development to  optimize the use of existing \npower  generation  capacity  and  accommodate  future  power  generation  development  by \nstrengthening its grid system planning capacity and identifying a priority list of least-cost projects \nfor the 11FYP. \n \n10.  The TA will (i) examine key issues related to grid system planning; (ii) assess the current \ngrid  development  planning  and  management  capacity  of  SGC;  (iii)  survey  and  analyze \ninternational best practices in grid system planning and management in a restructured power \nmarket; (iv) assist SGC to establish guidelines on grid system planning procedures, criteria, and \nmethodologies suitable for the PRC\u2019s power sector; (v) strengthen SGC\u2019s capacity in grid \ndevelopment  planning  and  management;  (vi)  assist  SGC  to  implement  the  regional \ninterconnection strategy recommended in the earlier TA; (vii) carry out grid system planning for \nthe selected pilot regional or provincial power networks; (viii) assist SGC in identifying a priority \n                                                 \n5  The 11FYP is the key economic development plan for the PRC that covers the period 2006\u20132010. \n6  ADB. 2000.

", "4 \n \nlist of least-cost projects for 11FYP; (ix) make a preliminary assessment of the identified least-\ncost projects; (x) establish an effective monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system to monitor the \nimpact  of  the  TA;  (xi) conduct  an  international  seminar;  (xii)  carry  out  a  field  study;  and \n(xiii) conduct a consultation workshop with main stakeholders. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  in  close  consultation  with  stakeholders,  targeted \nconsumers, and potential private sector investors. The TA will be in three phases. In phase 1, the \nconsultants will do a detailed background study and provide a thorough understanding of the \nissues. During phase 2, the consultants will undertake data gathering and preliminary analysis. \nThey will identify the main issues to be addressed to achieve the TA objectives and conduct an \ninternational seminar to introduce international best practices that are suitable for the PRC\u2019s \npower sector, and required reform measures. In phase 3, the consultants will analyze in detail the \nissues relating to grid system and grid development planning and carry out grid system planning \nfor the pilot regional and provincial power grids. The consultants will also carry out impact \nassessments from the technical, institutional, economic, social, financial, pricing, environmental, \nand  poverty  impact  viewpoints.  The  consultants  will  organize  a  workshop  with  the  main \nstakeholders  to  disseminate  the  TA  findings  and  recommendations.  The  outline  terms  of \nreference for consultants are in Appendix 2. \n \n12.  The TA will include an international seminar on grid system planning in phase 2. The \nseminar will evaluate international experience in related areas and their relevance to the PRC, \nto be incorporated in grid system planning in phases 2 and 3. Consultants will help organize this \nseminar. International and domestic experts will be invited to present papers and participate in \nthe  discussions.  The  consultants  will  prepare  a  report  summarizing  the  discussions  and \nidentifying issues relevant to the PRC. The TA includes an international field study to expose \nselected PRC personnel to the latest trends and international best practices in grid system \nplanning and management. Personnel from SGC and other governmental agencies involved in \npolicymaking and implementation of  grid system planning will undertake the 2-week study. The \nconsultants will consider the particular needs of the study participants and prepare a detailed \nproposal for ADB approval, specifying the (i) objectives of the field study, (ii) institutions to be \nvisited, (iii) agenda for discussion and training, (iv) name and job description of each nominee, \nand (v) costs. Selection procedures for the international field study must be acceptable to ADB, \ntaking into account economy and efficiency. At the end of the field study, the participants will \nsubmit to ADB a report summarizing their findings and recommendations. \n \n13.  The  major  assumptions  and  risks  in  successful  implementation  of  the  TA  include \ncounterpart support, adequate and timely provision of data, delay in submission of required \nstudies,  delay  in  consultant  selection,  and  poor  consultant  performance.  In  addition,  the \nGovernment\u2019s  continuing  commitment  to  power  sector  reforms,  tariff  rationalization,  and \ntransparent regulation is necessary. Efforts will be made for timely recruitment of competent \nconsultants.  SGC  is  committed  to  necessary  reforms  and  agreed  to  provide  adequate \ncounterpart  support  and  data  when  needed.  Close  coordination  among  the  consultants, \nexecuting and implementing agencies, and ADB will further mitigate the risks. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $700,000  equivalent  comprising  $362,000  in  foreign \nexchange and $338,000 in local currency equivalent (Appendix 3). ADB will provide $500,000 \nequivalent to finance $322,000 of the foreign exchange cost and $178,000 equivalent of the \nlocal currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. ", "    5 \n \nSGC will contribute $200,000 equivalent representing about 29% of the TA cost, to finance the \nremaining foreign exchange cost of $40,0007 and local currency cost of $160,000 equivalent. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  SGC will be the Executing Agency for the TA. ADB will select and engage the services of \ninternational and domestic consultants according to its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB for selecting and engaging domestic consultants. The \ninternational consultants will have expertise in grid system planning and network management, \npower sector restructuring and institutional reforms, power economics, and environmental and \npoverty  assessment.  The  domestic  consultants  will  have  similar  expertise.  An  estimated \n29 person-months  of  consulting  services  will  be  required,  including  8  person-months  of \ninternational and 21 person-months of domestic consulting services. The services of consultants \nwill be provided through a consulting firm selected after the submission of simplified technical \nproposals and the use of the quality- and cost-based selection method. The consultants\u2019 terms \nof reference are in Appendix 2. The TA is expected to commence on 25 January 2005 and be \ncompleted by 30 May 2006 \n \n16.  SGC will establish a counterpart team with representatives from SGC and the provinces \nand regions selected for pilot studies.8 The counterpart team will interact with the consultants \nduring TA implementation. SGC will establish a steering committee comprising senior officials \nfrom SGC and  the five generating companies  and representatives from other government \norganizations and agencies involved in formulating and implementing policies for power system \nplanning and development, including the national development and reform commission and \nSERC.  The  steering  committee  will  be  the  apex  body  that  will  convey  and  interpret  the \ngovernment\u2019s views on policy issues and generally oversee TA implementation. The counterpart \nteam members will interact  with members of the steering committee to seek clarification on \nissues and matters that fall outside the purview of SGC. SGC will provide interpreters, local \ntransportation, and office space with suitable facilities in Beijing. Some office equipment to be \nfinanced under the TA will be procured by the international consultants in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The consultants will establish an effective M&E system to \nmonitor the impact of the TA and  provide the basis for SGC\u2019s impact monitoring after TA \ncompletion. The M&E system will include specific and measurable targets, and identify key risks \nand institutional arrangement for effective monitoring. The consultants will give the necessary \ntraining in monitoring. The established  M&E system will be shared with SERC, which, as the \npower sector regulatory body, closely monitors power sector development. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Capacity Strengthening of Power Planning \nProcess, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n7  To finance part of the 2-week field study by personnel from SGC and other government agencies. \n8  The pilot region and province will be selected by SGC, and ADB in phase 1.

The technical assistance (TA) will be carried out by a consulting firm with experience in \ngrid system planning; institutional, economic, financial, environmental, and social analyses; and \nimpact assessment in the power subsector. The international consultants will be a system \nplanning specialist, a power or environmental economist, a social impact analyst, a financial \nanalyst,  and  an  institutional  specialist.  The  study  will  require  about  8  person-months  of \ninternational  and  21  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services.  To  ensure  effective \nassistance  to  the  international  consultants,  the  domestic  consultants  will  have  the  same \nexpertise. The consultants will work closely with the State Grid Corporation (SGC) and ensure \neffective transfer of know-how. The international consultants will be recruited in accordance with \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The consultants \nwill evaluate international experience in related areas and its relevance to the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC) and tailor the recommendations to reflect PRC\u2019s situation so that these can be \neffectively implemented. The recommendations should focus on how to go from the current grid \nsystem planning to an efficient stage of system planning using international best practices. \n \nA.  Terms of Reference \n \n2.  The terms of reference of the consulting services will include, but will not be limited to \nthe following: \n \n1.  Phase 1:  Background Study and Assessment \n \n3.  At the start of the TA, the consultants will do a detailed background study to gain a \nthorough understanding of the issues related to power grid system planning in the PRC. The \nconsultants will review relevant reports and studies, including those of SGC and international \nagencies such as ADB, World Bank, and other funding agencies, and will have discussions with \nmembers of the steering committee and counterpart team to obtain a good understanding of the \nGovernment's reform directions and establish a sound basis for the TA work. An inception report \nwill be submitted after the phase 1 study. The report should trace the history of grid system \nplanning in the PRC, discuss significant changes and their impact, and present a clear picture of \ngrid system and development planning in the PRC covering (i) the current grid system and \ndevelopment planning in different regions and provinces; (ii) the procedures in grid system \nplanning  approval;  (iii)  the  relationship  among  the  institutions  involved;  (iv)  roles  and \nresponsibilities of central and provincial governments in grid system and development planning; \n(v) financial position and financial governance of power grid utilities; (vi) affordability of power to \nconsumers; (vii) objectives of grid system and development planning, i.e. the overall objective \nand the objective at each development stage; and (viii) past reform measures including those \nfor grid system and development planning at  each development stage. \n \n2.
