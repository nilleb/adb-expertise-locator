At the request of the Government of Pakistan, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nfielded a Fact-Finding Mission from 28 September to 9 October 2004 to develop a technical \nassistance (TA) proposal for the Sindh Coastal and Inland Community Development Project \n(SCICDP).1 The Mission discussed the relevant issues with the federal Government and the \ngovernment of Sindh (GOS). The preliminary project framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Pakistan's coastline has two provinces: Balochistan and Sindh. A total of 350 kilometers \n(km)  of  coastline  extends  along  the  province  of  Sindh.  A  combination  of  the  subtropical \nenvironment and the riverine flow into the Indus delta has resulted in a highly productive coastal \nzone of significant biodiversity2 and economic value. Recent estimates indicate that of the total \nmarine resource production for Pakistan, 71% is derived from Sindh.3 The average annual \nincome from marine commodity exports amount to PRs2.2 billion, of which 60% is attributable to \nshrimp and 40% to fish.4 Similarly, coastal agriculture (including livestock) continues to be an \nimportant contributor to the local economy in Sindh. The economies of the local coastal/deltaic \ncommunity? with approximately 2.3 million people, the majority of whom are poor? are thus \nprincipally based on the fisheries industry and coastal agriculture; and for coastal communities, \nmarine and coastal resources provide a primary source of nutrition.  \n \n3.  However, as a result of water shortage issues and degradation of both groundwater and \nsurface freshwater resources, which have been severely affected by seawater intrusion, potable \nwater sources are scarce, with severe implications particularly for coastal farming. Severe water \nshortage has also affected the natural vegetation of the area, which is under environmental \nstress as a result of increasing hypersalinity and evidenced by a reduction in mangrove cover \nand concomitant reduction in breeding grounds for many commercially important species of fish \nand crustaceans. At the same time, land use practices such as the building of bunds and shrimp \nponds has interfered with water flow and hydrological processes. In some areas in the Indus \ndelta, excessive water abstraction and interference with upstream hydrology? such as urban \nwater  pumpage,  irrigation  and  hydropower? have  had  devastating  effects  on  downstream \ncoastal ecosystems by reducing the quantity and regularity of freshwater flows. \n \n4.  The situation is further exacerbated by property rights conflicts between the farming and \nfishing  communities  in  the  area  over  the  distribution  of  water  from  the  Indus  River.  The \navailability and use of freshwater within Sindh also appear to be problematic between agrarian \nupper  Sindh  and  coastal  lower  Sindh  since  both  groups  rely  heavily  on  freshwater  for \nsustainable cultivation of crops as well as to prevent sea intrusion into the deltoid region. Lower \nfreshwater flows downstream consequently translate into disincentives for farmers to cultivate \ncrops and for fishermen to invest in fishing technologies. Reduced freshwater traversing lower \nSindh severely retards mangrove cultivation and also has a detrimental impact on the fishing \nindustry, and thus negatively impacts the livelihood of the coastal population.5 \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 6 February 2004.   \n2  The Indus delta is classified as a Global 200 Ecoregion by the World Wide Fund for Nature and includes Ramsar \nwetlands sites. \n3  Data from Fisheries wing, Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries Department, Government of Sindh.   \n4  Economic Survey of Pakistan, 2000-2001.  \n5  Documented evidence indicates that between 2000 and 2002, the outflow of water released downstream of the \nKotri Barrage declined significantly, resulting in massive sea intrusion in the coastal areas of Badin and Thatta \ndistricts. This intrusion not only wreaked havoc on the human and fish populations, but also severely degraded \nagricultural land.   \n ", "2  \n \n5.  A combination of all these factors, including mismanagement of marine resources and \nlack of enforcement of environmental laws, has led to an unsustainable situation. An analysis of \nthe current situation and apparent trends in Sindh suggests that a downward spiral of coastal \nand  marine  resource  degradation,  livelihood  loss,  and  worsening  poverty  are  occurring \n(Appendix 2). There is evidence, both anecdotal and documented, to suggest that fish stocks \nare declining, and commercially important marine species are fast disappearing. Similarly, \nwater, air, and land are being contaminated by both on-site and off-site sectoral activities, \nleading  to  the  pollution  of  marine  and  coastal  environments.  Levels  of  urbanization  and \nindustrialization  upstream  of  coastal  and  marine  areas  are  high  and  land  in  this  belt  is \nintensively used, especially in Karachi district. For the most part, development activities are \ncarried out with scant regard to environmental concerns, and pay little attention to possible \nimpacts  on  marine  and  coastal  environments.  Water,  air,  and  land  pollution  arising  from \nactivities in agricultural, industrial, urban, and shipping sectors all give increasing cause for \nconcern because of their impacts on the natural environment, as well as on the living conditions \nand livelihood base of upper and lowland communities. \n \n6.  The magnitude of problems in the coastal areas of Sindh requires that an assistance \nprogram be developed to follow an ecosystem-management approach so as to benefit a larger \npopulation. The proposed SCICDP will cover the coastal districts of Badin and Thatta, and the \ncoastal areas of Karachi. The SCICDP will build on previous coastal fisheries and other related \nresource management initiatives by replicating successful approaches for implementing policies \nand effective use of management interventions. A significant and related component of the \nrecently concluded ADB regional technical assistance (RETA) Coastal and Marine Resources \nManagement and Poverty Reduction in South Asia6 was the development of integrated coastal \nzone management (ICZM)7 strategies and plans for selected high priority areas (HPAs).8 The \nICZM strategy and plan for HPAs was developed in a period spanning 5 years, with the goal to \n\u201cfoster  integrated  and  sustainable  coastal  and  marine  zone  management  practices  and \nequitable use of marine resources.\" Key objectives are to (i) work at the policy level to ensure \nthat integrated approaches to coastal and marine management are adopted; (ii) work toward \nsustainable  management  of  coastal  and  marine  resources;  (iii)  facilitate  sustainable \ndevelopment and poverty reduction in the HPAs; (iv) promote the equitable sharing and use of \ncoastal and marine resources; and (v) mitigate the negative impact of economic activities in \nhinterlands, in particular the distribution of water resources of the Indus River. The management \nplan was developed in considerable detail, including pilot testing the implementation of the \ninterventions and the staffing levels required. \n \n7.  Recognizing the deteriorating water flows and upstream obstructions, the SCICDP will \nattempt to coordinate with the approved ADB TA on  Water Sector Irrigation Development,9 \nwhich  aims  to  develop  the  capacity  for  water  resources  management,  and  investment \npreparation at the provincial and federal levels, and will help establish a permanent body to \nprovide strategic planning at the federal level. This effort is expected to strengthen the capacity \nof relevant water resources management institutions to address sustainable water flow issues to \nthe benefit of downstream communities in the Indus River delta. It is important to note, however, \n                                                 \n6 ADB. 2001.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The goal of the SCICDP is to support GOS strategies and initiatives to reduce pervasive \npoverty  by  improving  livelihood  opportunities  and  facilitating  sustainable  natural  resource \nmanagement in the project area. The purpose of the TA is to help the Government prepare the \nSCICDP, which will (i) improve the condition of coastal and marine fisheries and related \nresources by improved management of  coastal resources and ecosystems, and minimizing \nthreats to their ecological integrity; and (ii) increase incomes of coastal communities through \nimproved  coastal  resources  and  provision  of  supplementary  and/or  alternative  livelihood \nopportunities.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will formulate an investment project with the following possible components: (i) \npolicy  and  institutional  strengthening  for  integrated  coastal  resource  management;  (ii) \nmanagement of coastal fisheries resources, including rehabilitation and protection of fisheries \nresources and related ecosystems (including mangroves) through district government planning; \n(iii) provision of sustainable livelihood assistancefor income generation in coastal communities; \n \nand  (iv)  small-scale  infrastructure  development,  including  fish  landing  facilities  to  reduce \nproduction  losses  and  provide  environmental  and  social  investments  in  environmental \nprotection, provision of social services, and marketing facilities and infrastructure. The project \nframework will be developed as part of the process to facilitate project design.  \n \n10.  A key intervention that could result in improved sustainable livelihood projects and \nenhanced natural resources management for poor coastal communities  include community-\nbased programs to restore and rehabilitate saltwater-tolerant mangrove, most notably along the \nThatta coastline. Such programs would seek to demonstrate the current level of dependence on \nmangrove key communities and target specific user groups such as mangrove fodder and \nfuelwood  collectors  and  developers.  A  series  of  supplementary  or  alternative  sources  of \nsustainable  income  and  livelihood  enhancement  opportunities  will  also  be  developed:  (i) \nreinvestigation of aquaculture potential including a comprehensive analysis and feasibility study \nof the ecological and economic viability of this industry;10 (ii) development of saline agriculture \nand livestock production, which remain key livelihood enterprises for coastal communities in \nBadin and Thatta districts, as well as supporting infrastructure; (iii) development of codes of \nconduct for fishing in coastal and inland areas; (iv) post-harvest handling and marketing of fish \ncatch, including microenterprise development initiatives and training; (v) community mobilization \nschemes including specific assistance to fishing communities; (vi) targeted communications, \neducation, and awareness building incorporated into long-term management programs; and (vii) \nformulation of ICZM plans and strategies for all three coastal districts based on the findings and \n                                                 \n10 One of the lessons from previous ADB aquaculture projects in Pakistan was that the Indus River delta and coastal \narea (at that time) were unsuited to shrimp aquaculture due to fluctuating salinity levels and inadequate supplies of \nboth fresh and salt water, and the lack of a source of fry for commercially valuable species.

The  TA  will  follow  a  participatory  and  consultative  approach  to  involve  potential \nbeneficiaries and stakeholders. Specifically, participatory rapid appraisal, poverty analysis, and \nsocioeconomic assessment will be conducted in defined coastal areas of the three districts, and \nstakeholder workshops will be organized and conducted to discuss the project design and \nimplementation arrangements. The TA will review and update the status of marine and coastal \nfisheries resources in the project area, determine major problems, and identify opportunities and \nstrategies to achieve sustainable management of coastal resources.  Relevant information, \ndata, technical approaches, and policy recommendations from the RETA, and lessons learned \nfrom  projects  funded  by  ADB  and  other  sources  will  be  key  inputs  in  the  TA  study.  An \ninstitutional assessment will be conducted and will include an analysis of roles, responsibilities, \nand capabilities of provincial agencies, district governments, coastal communities, and private \nsector/nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  in  the  project  area.  The  TA  will  also  assess \nproposed project activities and formulate technical guidelines and methods for implementing the \nactivities, taking into consideration technical, environmental, and ecological conditions, and local \ninitiatives. The TA will identify economically viable and environmentally sound supplementary \nand  alternative  livelihood  interventions  by  community-based  organizations  and  the  private \nsector, as appropriate, incorporating relevant gender aspects. The output will be  a range of \noptions from which people can select and design the system that most effectively meets their \nneeds and best fits the opportunities and constraints of the local environment.  \n \n12.  The TA will be implemented in two phases. The diagnostic phase will focus on key \nconstraints to improved coastal livelihoods and natural resource management, and priority \nproblems requiring public intervention; the second phase will focus on preparing the feasibility \nstudy. The TA will (i) analyze relevant economic information, estimate costs and benefits for the \nproposed project and components; (ii) estimate economic rates of return and financial benefits; \n(iii) conduct economic valuation of environmental impacts and analyze the financial viability and \nsustainability  of  proposed  project  activities;  (iv)  analyze  project  risks;  (v)  review  the \nmanagement mechanisms for public funds and recommend suitable financial arrangements in \naccordance with policies and guidelines on decentralization for the project; (vi) assess the \nfinancial capacity of participating provincial and district governments; and (vii) conduct an \nappropriate marketing study for the livelihood products. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $814,000 equivalent, consisting of $424,000 in \nforeign exchange and $390,000 equivalent in local currency. ADB will cover the entire foreign \nexchange costs as well as $226,000 equivalent of the local currency cost for a total of $650,000 \nequivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment  of  Japan.  The  Government  will  provide  the  remaining  local  currency  cost  of \n$164,000  equivalent  to  cover  expenses  for  office  accommodation,  counterpart  staff,  etc. \nDetailed cost estimates are found in Appendix 3. The Government has been informed that \napproval of the TA does not constitute a commitment by ADB to finance an ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB will engage a firm or consortia of firms to undertake the TA in accordance with its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants using the quality- and cost-based selection procedures \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The TA will \nrequire a total of 61 person-months of consulting services: 20 international and 41 domestic. ", "  5\nConsultant expertise will be in the following areas: policy and institutional development, natural \nresource  economics,  coastal  resources  management,  coastal  fisheries  infrastructure \ndevelopment,  rural sociology/community development, gender issues, coastal environmental \nassessments for improved management, rural infrastructure, enterprise development, farming \nsystems/crop development, fisheries and aquaculture development, and financial management. \nThe outline terms of reference for consulting services are in Appendix 4. Simplified technical \nproposals will be required from short-listed consulting firms. All procurement under the TA will \nbe in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 7 months (excluding the 1 month break), starting in \nMay 2005 and ending in January 2006. The lead consultant will submit an inception report \nwithin 4 weeks of the start of the TA, a midterm report within 3 months (at the end of phase 1), a \ndraft final report (including a detailed feasibility study for the proposed project) within 6 months, \nand a final report within 1 month of receiving comments on the draft final report from ADB and \nthe GOS. Workshops will be arranged to seek formal consultations and present the findings and \nreports of the TA. Tripartite meetings of the Government, ADB, and the consultants will be held \nfollowing the submission of the inception, interim, and draft final reports. \n \n16.  The provincial Planning and Development Board will be the TA Executing Agency, and \nwill establish a project management office (PMO) in Karachi to coordinate TA implementation. A \nproject coordinator will head the PMO and provide technical and logistical support to the \nconsultant team. Technical personnel from the Coastal Development Authority; Department of \nAgriculture,  Fisheries  and  Livestock;  Department  of  Forest  and  Wildlife;  Department  of \nEnvironment and Alternative Energy; and Department of Irrigation will be appointed as TA \ncounterpart staff. In addition, the TA will establish a committee comprising International Union \nfor Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, the Pakistan Fisher Folk Forum, and World \nWide Fund for Nature to provide independent advisory support to the TA. A project steering \ncommittee (PSC) will be established to provide overall guidance to the TA and to decide on all \ntechnical and design aspects of the project. The PSC will be headed by the Planning and \nDevelopment  Department,  additional  chief  secretary,  and  will  comprise  director-level \nrepresentation from the aforementioned departments, as well as the Department of Finance, \nDepartment of Local Government, and representatives of the three district governments.  \n \nIV.

Information on the poverty \nhead count, based on the household income and expenditure surveys data, indicates that poverty in Sindh Province \ndeclined marginally during FY1993\u2013FY1997, but increased sharply (by 41%) in FY1999. In the province's rural areas, \npoverty increased from 34.7% in FY1999 to 52.2% in FY2001.a The coastal districts of Sindh?s pecifically Badin and \nThatta?and the coastal areas of Karachi are identified as \"less developed areas\" of the province. b No poverty profile \nhas been developed: neither has there been any comprehensive assessment or analysis dealing with the specific \naspect of poverty in the coastal communities of Sindh. However, it is evident from available data that the coastal \ncommunities experience a severely reduced quality of life in terms of access to education, health, sanitation, civic \ninfrastructure, public utilities, economic and employment opportunities, housing, and landownership. The coastal \npopulation depends on fisheries, agriculture, and forestry for livelihoods. With the degradation of the natural resource \nbase, there has been a corresponding decline in the socioeconomic condition of the local communities. The loss of \nlivelihood opportunities has caused an increase in poverty levels, malnutrition, and general deterioration in the health \nof the population. \na   Government of Sindh Planning and Development Department. 2003.

Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nWomen\u2019s roles are segregated from that of their male counterparts. Women are confined to household-related work \nincluding looking after the house, children, and animals, and other related duties. They are, however, important \nresource users in terms of timber collection. Mangrove wood is used for fuel, construction, and other purposes. The \nindiscriminate use of this resource base poses a serious threat to the deltaic mangrove forests. Previously, women \nhad been employed in making fishing nets. This activity has now been reduced due to the availability and use of \nready-made nylon nets. Women in some places, however, engage in activities such as processing/sorting fish/ \nshrimps. The Sindh Government\u2019s PRSP identified the following strategy to address gender considerations: promoting \nthe participation of women in decision-making processes, policy changes to facilitate increased female participation, \ncapacity building and skills development, reducing gender disparity, ensuring access to gender-disaggregated data, \nand providing improved access to social services.  \n \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes     No \nThe project design will incorporate a strategy in which women are seen not just as project beneficiaries but as a key \npartner in the development process. The gender strategy and plan will be based on a prior assessment of gender \nissues in the selected project sites and will include specific interventions and activities aimed at addressing identified \ngender issues. The plan also include a mechanism to improve women\u2019s participation in training and other capacity- \nbuilding initiatives, as well as ways to initiate their access to services and information under the proposed project. \n \nE.
