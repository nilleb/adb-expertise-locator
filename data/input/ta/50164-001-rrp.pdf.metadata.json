I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof up to $250,000,000 equivalent in US dollars and yuan, comprising (i) an A loan of up to \n$150,000,000  equivalent  in  US  dollars  and  yuan,  and  (ii)  a  complementary  loan  of  up  to \n$100,000,000  equivalent  in  US  dollars  and  yuan,  to  China  Water  Environment  Group \nInvestment  (CWEI)  and  Xinkai  Water  Environment  Investment  (XWE)  for  the  Integrated \nWastewater Management Project in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n2.  Project identification. Restoring the health of river and lake ecosystems and improving \nresilience to water-related disasters are increasingly important priorities of the Government of \nthe PRC. According to the Ministry of Environmental Protection, 28% of the available surface \nwater of the country\u2019s seven major rivers and 31% of the water of key lakes and reservoirs are \nunfit  for  human  consumption.1 Once  polluted  to  this  degree,  traditional  pollution  mitigation \nmeasures, such as standalone wastewater treatment facilities, are usually insufficient to recover \nthe water ecosystem. \n \n3.  The  government  has  announced  an  aggressive  action  plan  to  develop  water \ninfrastructure, enforce strict pollution controls, and rehabilitate degraded water resources.2 To \nsupport  these  efforts,  the  government  is  also  encouraging  new  forms  of  public\u2013private \npartnership  (PPP)  to  promote  waterbody  pollution  control  and  rehabilitation.3 Through  an \nintegrated, coordinated approach to planning, an increasing number of local governments are \nengaging  private  operators  to  mitigate  pollution  and  restore  the  health  of  river  and  lake \necosystems  through  multiple,  interlocking  subprojects  tendered  under  a  single  basin-wide \nconcession. Openness to this comprehensive approach, involving wider participation of the \nprivate sector, reflects a growing expectation that PPP will enhance operational efficiency, \nfinancing capacity, and technical expertise, and thereby address the country\u2019s water pollution \nissues more effectively. \n \n4.  Through discussion with stakeholders in the PRC\u2019s water and sanitation sectors and the \nongoing screening of project opportunities, the project team identified China Water Environment \nGroup (CWE), a leading integrated water infrastructure provider, as having specialized expertise \nin river and lake restoration projects. CWE acknowledged the strong experience of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in sovereign and nonsovereign water sector operations, and asked \nADB to lead the arrangement of a dual currency financing package. \n \n5.  Project design. The project is designed to support the implementation of integrated \nwastewater management concessions targeting environmental services for rivers and lakes. \nThe ADB loan would support CWE in designing, constructing, and operating a series of facilities \nspanning several components, including (i) wastewater treatment plants; (ii) sludge treatment \nplants; (iii) sewage conveyance and interception pipelines; (iv) other civil works, such as the \n                                                \n1  Ministry of Environmental Protection. 2015.

", "2  \ndredging of rivers and lakes, riverbank reinforcements, odor treatment, and landscaping; and \n(vi) the development of wetlands. \n \n6.  CWE will select subprojects located in urban sections of key rivers and lakes designated \nas  government  priority  areas  for  environmental  protection.  For  each  subproject,  CWE  will \ndevelop  and  operate  the  component  facilities  as  PPPs  to  be  governed  under  concession \nagreements  signed  with  city  or  county  governments. The  agreements  will  (i)  state  CWE\u2019s \nresponsibilities  for  construction  and  operation,  (ii)  convey  rights  of  service  exclusivity,  (iii) \nidentify  performance  standards  and  other  output  requirements,  and  (iv)  set  forth  payment \nmechanisms. The subprojects will be located in the central and western provinces of the PRC.4 \n \n7.  The sponsor and borrowers. CWE is the project\u2019s sponsor and guarantor. With a \ntreatment capacity of 1.8 million tons per day in 2015, CWE is one of the world\u2019s 50 largest \nwastewater  treatment  companies  by  operating  scale.5 The  company  is  the  PRC\u2019s  most \nexperienced  player  in  integrated  river  and  lake  pollution  control  projects,  and  features \nprominently in national PPP initiatives. In 2014, CWE successfully implemented two greenfield \nnational PPP demonstration projects out of the Ministry of Finance\u2019s first batch of eight, and is \ncurrently developing four projects from the second batch.6  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n8.  Two wholly owned subsidiaries of CWE will serve as ADB\u2019s borrowers: (i) CWEI will be \nthe borrower for the US dollar and offshore yuan tranches, and (ii) XWE will be the borrower for \nthe onshore yuan tranche. Both companies are investment holding companies of CWE, and do \nnot have managerial or financial autonomy. CWE will guarantee the ADB loans. \n \n9.  The requisite integrity due diligence was conducted during project preparation, and no \nsignificant integrity issues were discovered. \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n10.  Impact. The impact will be mitigated water pollution in rivers and lakes in the PRC, \nconsistent with the goals of the PRC\u2019s State Council (footnote 3). \n \n11.  Outcome. The outcome will be the expanded provision of wastewater management \nservices under integrated concessions in selected central and western provinces of the PRC. \n \n12.   Output.  The  output  will  be  the  construction  of  wastewater  treatment  plants  and \nassociated civil works for the improvement of river and lake water quality. By 2024, river or lake \nrehabilitation  subprojects  will  be  developed  with  the  capacity  to  treat  2.3  million  tons  of \n                                                \n4  The designation of \u201ccentral\u201d and \u201cwestern\u201d here includes the provinces and provincial areas of Chongqing, Gansu, \nGuangxi, Guizhou, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Ningxia, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Xinjiang, and Yunnan. \n5  Global Water Intelligence. 2015. China Shakes up Private Water Power List. July. \n6  One example of a PPP undertaken by CWE is the Erhai Lake Public\u2013Private Partnership Project in Dali, Yunnan, \nwhere CWE is in charge of designing, building and operating an interception sewer pipeline network, water \npumping stations, wastewater treatment plants, upstream reservoirs, and artificial wetlands to supply water for \nfarming and irrigation. Another such example is the Nanming River Rehabilitation Project in Guiyang, Guizhou \nProvince, the first phase of which involved wastewater and sludge facilities, river dredging, sewage pipelines, and \nriverway development. The project benefitted from strategic work undertaken by ADB\u2019s East Asia Department \nunder technical assistance to the Guiyang Municipal Government to develop a strategy for integrated water \nresource management.  ", "  3\nwastewater and 2,900 tons of sludge per day, as well as 190 kilometers of sewage pipeline \nnetworks and other infrastructure. The facilities will comply with ADB safeguard requirements \nand technical and financial eligibility criteria.7 \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n13.  Consistency with ADB strategy. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review \nof Strategy 2020, which identifies infrastructure and the environment as two of ADB\u2019s four \nstrategic priorities.8 With regard to infrastructure, the project is aligned with the strategy\u2019s focus \non water, sanitation, and waste management, as well as its emphasis on PPP. With regard to \nthe  environment,  the  project  mitigates  water  pollution  and  health  threats  and  promotes \nenvironmentally sustainable growth. \n \n14.  Consistency  with  the  country  strategy.  By  supporting  a  new  form  of  PPP, \nenvironment  management,  and  inclusive  growth,  the  project  addresses  three  of  the  five \nstrategic priorities of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC: managing climate change \nand the environment, supporting inclusive economic growth, and supporting institutional and \ngovernance  reform.9 In  particular,  the  project  aligns  with  this  strategy\u2019s  sector  focus  on \nenvironmental protection, and strongly complements ADB\u2019s initiatives in the management of \nwater-based  natural  resources,  including  flood  management,  wetland  conservation,  water \nresources development, and the protection of biodiversity and ecosystems.10 \n \n15.  Consistency with the water sector strategy. The project aligns with ADB\u2019s water \npolicy aims to reverse the degradation of water resources caused by agricultural, industrial, and \nmunicipal effluents.11 ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020 also identifies wastewater \nmanagement as a key operational focus in rapidly industrializing countries like the PRC.12 The \nproject is an example of the type of intervention envisaged by the plan, which promotes water \nas a core investment area and raises ADB\u2019s water investment target to $2.0 billion\u2013$2.5 billion \neach year by 2020, with an additional $500 million per year targeted in private sector lending. \n \n                                                \n7  The eligibility criteria shall include (i) a concession agreement with service exclusivity, (ii) location, (iii) compliance \nwith the PRC\u2019s environmental standards, and (iv) the exclusion of category A projects. \n8  ADB. 2014.

Table 2 summarizes the implementation arrangements. \n \nTable 2: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory framework  For each  ADB-funded subproject, CWE will enter  into an  overarching \nconcession  framework  agreement  with  the  host  government.  The \nframework agreement will lay out the concession\u2019s components, which \nmay consist of separate detailed BOT, TOT, or DBFO sub-agreements. \nEach subproject will be implemented in accordance with granted approvals \nand  during  construction  and  operation  be  subject  to  government \ninspections for various aspects, including environment, land acquisition, \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  ethnic  minorities,  labor,  safety,  quality,  and \nsanitation. \nManagement  CWE will centralize subproject development, procurement, and financing \narrangements across its operations. CWE will establish project companies \nfor each subproject. \nImplementation period  January 2017\u2013December 2020  \nConstruction arrangements  CWE will centrally coordinate the construction of each subproject, which \nwill be managed by a dedicated team. Various construction components, \nprimarily  civil  works,  equipment  procurement,  and  installation  will  be \noutsourced to subcontractors. Goods and services will be procured from \nADB  member  countries  in  a  transparent  manner  through  competitive \nbidding. \nOperations arrangements   \nRevenue structure  Under BOT and TOT, CWE will charge wastewater tariffs based on the \nvolume of treated wastewater, subject to a minimum volume of offtake \nguaranteed by the host government. Tariffs will be set to ensure an agreed \nreturn on investment and indexed to operating costs and inflation. Under \nDBFO,  payments  to  CWE  are  made  in  installments  based  on  the \nachievement  of  construction  milestones  and  provision  of  operational \nservices on an agreed schedule. \nMajor cost structure  Major  operational  costs  include  electricity,  materials,  labor,  and \nadministrative and maintenance expenses. \nOperation and  Operation and maintenance will generally be handled by each subproject \nmaintenance  company\u2019s staff, who will be either transferred from CWE or recruited \nexternally. \nPerformance monitoring  Key performance indicators, including output and outcome measures, will \nbe reported by CWE and monitored by ADB throughout the life of the \nproject. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, BOT = build-operate-transfer, CWE = China Water Environment Group, DBFO = \ndesign-build-finance-operate, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, TOT = transfer-own-transfer. \nSource: ADB. \n \nF.  Projected Financial and Economic Performance \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n ", "  5\nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n17.  ADB\u2019s proposed assistance to CWE consists of (i) an A loan of up to $150 million \nequivalent  in  US  dollars  and  yuan,  and  (ii)  a  complementary  loan  of  up  to  $100  million \nequivalent in US dollars and yuan. ADB will fund the A loan from its ordinary capital resources \nand the complementary loan from participating banks with ADB acting as lender of record.  \n  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n18.  ADB involvement in the project is justified by the following: \n(i)  The project will have a significant demonstration impact as the first ADB private \nsector intervention to support an emerging PPP model for integrated wastewater \nmanagement,  wherein  a  single  concessionaire  designs  and  implements  a \ncomprehensive lake and river pollution prevention and rehabilitation program that \ninvolves multiple environmental interlocking facilities and services. \n(ii)  The project will build on ADB\u2019s long-standing public sector interventions and \nstrong nonsovereign track record in wastewater treatment and water supply in \nthe PRC, especially in less developed regions. \n(iii)  ADB\u2019s requirements will ensure that CWE implements high quality environmental \nand  social  management,  commercial  best  practice,  and  strong  corporate \ngovernance. \n(iv)  ADB will act as a catalyst to mobilize commercial cofinance by linking river and \nlake rehabilitation in the PRC, a new area of private participation, with the bank \nfinancing community. \n \nC.  Risks \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n27.  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (SPS),  2009,  the  project  is \nclassified as category B for environment, category B for involuntary resettlement, and category \nC for indigenous peoples. The project team conducted environmental and social safeguards due \ndiligence to assess the potential impacts and risks associated with CWE\u2019s operations. This \nrevealed that each subproject\u2019s potential environmental impacts during civil construction works \ninclude the generation of dust, air emissions, noise, wastes, soil erosion, and water pollution. \nHowever, these are expected to be short-term and localized. During the operations phase, key \nenvironmental impacts could include (i) noise impacts due to plant operations; (ii) water quality \nimpacts due to poor effluent quality; (iii) odor and health risks due to poor sludge management; \nand  (iv)  health  and  safety  risks  due  to  the  buildup  of  gases,  particularly  in  underground \nwastewater treatment facilities. Potential environmental impacts associated with construction \nand  operation  can  be  mitigated  by  following  international  engineering  best  practices  and \nimplementing  an  appropriate  environmental  management  plan.  Initial  environmental \nexaminations will be prepared for ADB-funded subprojects in accordance with ADB\u2019s SPS. Prior \n ", "6  \nto the first disbursement, CWE will update its environmental and social management system \n(ESMS) to include screening procedures to avoid subprojects with the potential to be classified \nas category A for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \n28.  A corporate audit of CWE and four of its existing subprojects, which are currently not \ncandidates  for  ADB  financing,  found  in  place  environmental  and  social  safeguards \ncommensurate  with  the  impacts  and  risks  of  each. 13 Where  gaps  were  found,  CWE  was \ninformed of corrective actions which ADB recommends are addressed and reflected in the \nupdated ESMS. CWE\u2019s institutional capacity and commitment to manage the project\u2019s social \nand environmental impacts are deemed adequate, but will be enhanced through company-wide \ncapacity development (covering both CWEI and XWE) in the implementation of the updated \nESMS. \n \n29.  Similarly, the audit found that land required for existing projects had been acquired in \naccordance with local laws and to a standard consistent with ADB\u2019s SPS. No subproject impacts \non distinct and vulnerable ethnic minority groups were detected in past subprojects, and none \nare expected from future subprojects. New facilities are expected to be constructed in sparsely \npopulated suburban areas classified as development zones or reserved land.14 This will reduce \nthe impacts on local populations from the acquisition of land and rights-of-way. If the reserved \nstate-owned  land  is  insufficient  for  future  subprojects,  collective  land  will  be  acquired. \nUnderground pipelines are laid along roads and rivers, which induce temporary land occupation \nimpacts only. CWE will work with government agencies to ensure that subprojects avoid or \nminimize  the  need  for  residential  or  arable  land,  but,  where  displacement  impacts  are \nunavoidable, CWE will put in place action plans commensurate with impacts, in accordance with \nADB\u2019s SPS requirements. CWE will implement the audit\u2019s recommendations and submit an \nannual performance report on ESMS implementation to ADB. \n \n30.  CWE will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection \nStrategy (2001), will take measures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor \nstandards.15 The borrower will report regularly to ADB on (i) its (and its contractors\u2019) compliance \nwith  such  laws,  and  (ii)  the  measures  taken.  Information  disclosure  and  consultation  with \naffected people will be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n31.  CWE was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n32.  The proposed direct A loan is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and \nsingle-project exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \n                                                \n13 The corporate and subproject audits were undertaken by AECOM, a qualified and experienced external expert. \n14 Two types of land can be acquired for future subprojects: (i) state-owned, unused land reserved by local \ngovernments for future development activities; and (ii) collective land within the city planning area that can be \nacquired according to the local development plan. \n15 ADB. 2003.
