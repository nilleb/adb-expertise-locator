INTRODUCTION\n1. Eight of the 12 Pacific developing member countries (PDMCs)1 are undertaking\neconomic, governance, and public sector reform programs with the assistance of the\nAsian Development Bank (ADB).  East Timor as it prepares for nationhood is also faced\nwith similar challenges.2  A critical variable to the success of these reform programs is\nthe ability of senior government officials, including parliamentarians, to manage and\nsustain the reform process.  This regional technical assistance (RETA) project seeks to\nstrengthen these skills by providing opportunities, in conferences and training courses,\nfor senior officials and parliamentarians to meet, exchange views and experiences, and\nreinforce their commitment for the ongoing reform programs.3  The inclusion of the\ntechnical assistance (TA) in ADB\u2019s 2000 RETA Program was granted by the RETA\nScreening Committee in November 1999.4\n2. In line with ADB\u2019s objective of regional cooperation, the proposed programs have\nbeen designed and developed in close collaboration and partnership with the Asian\nDevelopment Bank Institute (ADBI), Colombo Plan Secretariat, Economic and Social\nCommission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) Operations Centre, and United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP).\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n3. In its recent assessment of the status of public sector reforms in the Pacific\nisland states, ADB has determined that many of the reforms proposed or undertaken,\nrest fundamentally on the management capacity of the public sector. That is, reform\ngoals and policies, while moving in the right direction, require managerial skills to be\nimplemented consistently and effectively over the long term. These skills are not well\ndeveloped in the Pacific  states.  While  macroeconomic  frameworks  can  provide  the\ndirection and focus of reforms, in other words, it is the management of institutions and\nagencies  determines  whether  the  reform  process  actually  unfolds  as  intended  and\nachieves the policy goals set.  Likewise, national  legislatures  need  the  capacity  to\nformulate and process legislation in support of the reforms.  This gap in management\nand legislative skills provides the rationale for the RETA.5\n4. The purpose of the RETA is to address, in a systematic and focused way, the\ndevelopment of the managerial and legislative competencies requisite to and demanded\nby public sector reforms in the island states. Such competencies are in great need of\nstrengthening, which offers the most potential for making a real difference to the reform\nprocess. The RETA , moreover, will not be a lone effort at capacity building. It will focus\n                                               \n1  ADB\u2019s PDMCs are Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, Kiribati, Republic of the Marshall Islands, Federated States\nof Micronesia, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, and Samoa.\n2  Although not an ADB member country, East Timor is eligible to receive TA from the ADB.\n3  The TA was first listed in the ADB Business Opportunities on 17 February 2000.\n4  See memorandum dated 25 November 1999 from Vice-Presidents (East and West) to the members of\nthe RETA Screening Committee. The title of the RETA has changed from the original \u201cManagement\nTraining for Senior Public Sector Managers.\u201d\n5  Although all 12 PDMCs and East Timor are eligible to participate in the RETA activities, each country\nhas the option to decide at any time whether or not to participate in any of the RETA conference and\ntraining activities.  For this reason, it was deemed unnecessary to request the prior concurrence of each\nPDMC or East Timor to its inclusion in the RETA.", "2\non  concerted,  outcome-based  development  of  managerial  skills,  over  an  extended\nperiod of time, leading to the continued enhancement  of  capacity  for  management\ndevelopment  in  the  island  states.  Public  sector  reform  takes  time  as  does  the\ndevelopment of managerial skills. The TA framework is presented in Appendix 1.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objective\n5.   The  primary  objective  is  to  build  capacities  of  senior  government  officials\n(including parliamentarians) to manage and support the reform processes in PDMCs\nand East Timor.\n \nB. Scope\n6. The  has  three  components:    (i)  a  governance  conference  for  Pacific\nparliamentarians organized in partnership with ESCAP Pacific Operations Centre and\nthe UNDP; (ii) the first offering of a four-module course on public sector management\nfor senior government officials from various PDMCs and East Timor, organized in close\ncollaboration with ADBI, the Colombo Plan Secretariat, and UNDP; and (iii) follow-up in-\ncountry seminars on public sector management.\n7. Governance Conference for Parliamentaries. The Governance Conference\nfor Parliamentarians will be held in Nadi,  Fiji  on  27-31  March  2000.    Appendix  2\nprovides an outline of the conference program.  Participants will include the speakers of\nall of the parliaments and congresses in the Pacific region (except Nauru).6  Five PDMC\nheads of state will address the conference.  Other participants include at least two\nother  members  of  parliament,  clerks  of  parliament,  constitutional  and  other\nofficeholders responsible for implementing and monitoring sound governance practices,\nrepresentatives  of  civil  society  organizations,  and  donor  representatives.    The\nconference will provide the opportunity for dialogue, debate and discussion on the roles\nand responsibilities of parliaments, parliament officers, committees, and constitutional\noffice  holders  with  respect  to  issues  of  accountability.    Through  this  process  of\nexchanging ideas and sharing experiences, that the importance of accountability for\nsound economic management and good governance will be reinforced, and the priority\nneeds for building the capacities of Pacific island parliaments and congresses to deal\nwith  reform-  and  governance-related  issues  will  be  identified.    The  conference\nrepresents an initial effort by ADB and UNDP to work closely with legislators to facilitate\nreform objectives; if the conference proves successful in promoting good governance\nand accountability, external assistance could be mobilized to replicate the conference\nin selected PDMCs.\n8. ADBI Course on Public Sector Management. The TA will co-finance the first\noffering by ADBI of a four-module course on public sector management for senior\ngovernment officials.  The key objectives of the course are to (i) build managerial\ncapacities and competencies to underpin the process of public sector reform in the\nPacific islands; (ii) develop the awareness and understanding by Pacific public sector\nmanagers of current international themes, issues, and promising practices in public\n                                               \n6  Nauru declined to participate , mainly due to the approaching national elections.", "3\nsector management and reform; and (iii) provide a forum in which participating public\nsector managers in the Pacific can critically examine their management and leadership\nstyles, share ideas, build on experience, and collaborate on public sector renewal. The\ncourse will be two years in duration involving four modules, each of approximately 7-10\ndays duration. The modules cover the following subject areas: (i) managing policy,\nstrategy, and performance; (ii) managing quality services;  (iii)  managing  programs,\nprojects, and systems; and (iv) leading people, innovation, and change.  The modules\nwill be spaced six months apart, with the first module to be conducted from 9-17 May\n2000 in Suva, Fiji.  The course will involve interactive learning and self-study via the\nInternet in between the modules.7 Appendix 2 provides a detailed description of each of\nthe four modules.\n9. The course will be targeted at 35 individuals who are from PDMCs and East\nTimor and are in leadership positions or have demonstrated leadership potential. The\ndistribution of spaces in the program will consider the relative size of the states in the\nregion. Clear criteria for admission to the course will be established jointly by ADB and\nADB.  Although seniority will be a consideration, admission to the course will not be\ndetermined  by  position  level  within  the  organization.    The  course  will  be  clearly\nestablished as an intellectually challenging and demanding experience requiring active\ncommitment for a two-year period. As such, ADBI Institute will grant an Advanced\nCertificate Attendance on of Public Sector Leadership upon successful completion of\nthe four modules.  To maintain academic standards, ADB and the ADBI will reserve the\nright to require participants who fail to meet the required commitment or performance to\nexit the course. The course is expected  to become a regular offering of ADBI, in\npartnership with other organizations such as Colombo Plan Secretariat and the UNDP.\n10. Public Sector Management. The TA will also finance in-country replication of\nentire modules (or selected portions of course modules) on public sector management,\nin response to requests from participants or governments. This  will permit specific\ncourse sessions, of particular relevance to a PDMC or East Timor, to be offered to a\nlarger group of participants in the country concerned, and therefore to have a wider\nimpact. The RETA is expected to finance three follow-up seminars in particular PDMCs\nplus, possibly, East Timor, each with about 20-25 participants.\n C. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n \n11. The total cost of the RETA is estimated at about $1.0 million equivalent. ADB\nwill finance $300,000 equivalent on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA program.\nThe remaining balance will be cofinanced by ADBI, the Colombo Plan Secretariat,  and\nESCAP, and UNDP. The detailed cost estimates are presented in Appendix 3.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n \n 12. ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. ADB\u2019s Office of Pacific Operations\n(OPO) will be responsible for processing and supervising the TA. The TA will finance\nthe travel and per diem of ADB staff participating as resource persons or speakers in\nthe conference and course modules. The TA is expected to begin in March 2000 and to\n                                               \n7  This approach to executive education has been tested by Massey University (New Zealand) in several\nPDMCs with positive results.", "4\nbe completed by the end of 2002, after about two and a half years.\n \n1. Governance Conference for Parliamentarians\n13. UNDP will handle organizational and logistical arrangements for the conference,\nincluding arrangements for the resource speakers.  The ESCAP Regional Centre will\nalso provide resource speakers at the conference.  ADB will finance the travel and per\ndiem of about half of the regional participants, up to a total of $60,000.  UNDP will meet\nall other costs, and will furnish ADB with periodic reports on progress and a final report\non completion of the activity.\n2. Public Sector Management for Senior Executives\n14. ADBI will be responsible for the overall design, coordination, and management\nof the course, including the evaluation of course impact and effectiveness, as part of its\napproved work program. ADBI and ADB will prepare periodic reports on progress and a\nfinal report on the completion of the entire four-module course. OPO staff will contribute\nto the course design, participate in the assessment and selection of participants, and\nserve as resource speakers in particular course modules.  In addition, ADB will finance\nthe travel and per diem of course participants, up to a total of $150,000.  The Colombo\nPlan Secretariat will also contribute the travel expenses of participants from Papua New\nGuinea and Fiji. UNDP will assist with logistical arrangements in Fiji and contribute the\nservices of a resource speaker. Other costs, including the Internet interactive distance\nlearning, will be covered by ADBI.\n3. Follow-up In-country Seminars on Public Sector Management\n15. The OPO will be responsible for implementing this component of the TA.  In\nresponse to requests from PDMC governments and/or East Timor, ADB will work with\nand/or UNDP, to design and organize an in-country replication of selected portions of\nthe course modules on public sector management.  As appropriate, ADB staff may\nserve as resource persons in these seminars. Participants are likely to be middle to\nsenior-level  officials  from  the  finance  and  planning  ministries  of  the  countries\nconcerned. Three person-months of international consulting services are expected to\nbe required for follow-up seminar. The consultants, who will serve as resource persons,\nwill  be  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants. The terms of reference for the international consultants are in Appendix 4.\n16. For all components of the TA, post-training questionnaires will be administered\nto participants, and results analyzed to assess the effectiveness of the courses in\nmeeting  participants\u2019  expectations  and  needs.  OPO  staff  will  be  responsible  for\nmonitoring and reporting on the implementation of the TA; progress and results will be\nreflected in the quarterly reports on ongoing RETAs.", "5\nIV.

ADBI Course on Public Sector Management for Senior Executives: General\nDescription of Course Modules\n1. Module One: Managing Policy, Strategy, and Performance\n2. This module focuses upon four elements. The first is the management of\npolicy development, design, analysis, implementation, and evaluation within a public\nsector context. Particular attention is paid to the development and management of policy\nwith crosscutting impact and resource requirements. The second element centers on the\nframework  and  tools  of  strategic  management  within  the  public  sector,  as  the  link\nbetween policy and resources. The third element introduces the models and practical\nuses of scenario planning as a tool to assist both in policy formulation and strategic\nmanagement. The fourth component concentrates on performance management at all\nlevels within the organization and techniques and tools for linking policies and strategies\nto performance outcomes.\n2. Module Two: Managing Quality Service\n3. This  module  introduces  participants  to  institutional  analysis  as  a\nframework within which to understand the dynamics of contemporary public sector\ninstitutions and organizations. The module directs participants\u2019 attention to the central\ntask of improving quality within all dimensions of public service and, in particular, to the\nservices rendered by the government to citizens, stakeholders, and business. Specific\nquality improvement designs and tools are presented with detailed case studies of their\napplications in governments around the world. Examples drawn from the private sector\nare also utilized to expand the participants\u2019 awareness of the importance and value of\nproviding  quality  service  on  a  continuous  basis.  The  module  also  introduces\nparticipants to activity-based management systems and tools that provide the structure\nupon which quality-driven process redesign rests. The use of a balanced scorecard\nframework and methodology for enhancing the strategic performance of public sector\norganizations is also stressed.\n4. Module Three: Managing Programs, Projects, and Systems\n5. This  module  introduces  participants  to  sector  analysis  and  logical\nframework analysis as an analytical and practical tool for designing and managing\nprograms and projects.The module also gives a detailed focus to the core function of\nmanaging programs within the public sector including the processes of program review,\nrevision, partnering, outsourcing, and termination. The second element in the module\nfocuses  on  frameworks  and  tools  for  effective  project  management,  including  the\nmanagement of financial and technical assistance. A third component of the module\nintroduces  strategies  for  the  management  of  crosscutting  and  government-wide\ninitiatives that entail interagency collaboration. The fourth compoent addresses the\nmanagement of moves toward decentralization in the public sector and the strengths\nand weaknesses of various designs. A fifth focus is given within this module to the\nways in which a strategic application of information technology can enhance quality and\nthe planning and management frameworks necessary for the application of information", "10 Appendix 2, page 3\ntechnology to  public  sector  service  and  decision  making.  The  last  element  of  the\nmodule centers on strategies for building an evaluation capacity in the public sector as\na key element in strengthening decision making, policy formulation, budgeting, and\nprogram review and assessment.\n6. Module Four: Leading People, Innovation, and Change\n7. This module examines the human element in public sector management\nwith a concentration on effective management of human resources and strategies for\nincreasing human and systems performance and productivity. This module centers on\nthe process of making change and fostering innovation within the context of the pubic\nsector. The module places particular stress on the development of leadership skills\nand, in that context, provides a  guided  self-assessment  of  participants\u2019  leadership\nstyles and the opportunity to develop an action plan for improvement. It uses the\nprocess of public sector reform in the Pacific as the context. The module also places\nemphasis on ways of enhancing public participation in the change process, of involving\nstakeholders in consultation and implementation, and in techniques for using the media\nand other  channels  of  communication  to  communicate  the  direction,  process,  and\nresults of change. Case examples of successful and failed approaches to change\nwithin the Pacific context are to be developed and presented by the participants as well\nas by international experts. The participants are to be introduced to the latest in proven\nchange technologies: futures search conferences, learning organizations, knowledge\nmanagement,  participatory  planning,  strategic  fora,  fast  cycle  change,  dialogue,\nappreciative inquiry, and complex systems modelling.", "11\n   Appendix 3\n00 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n00 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nP 00 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nD 83 0 1 0 4 1 7 2\nUN 3 6 1 11 88\n           \n0 0 0\nP 0 0 0\nCA 100 70 170\nS\nE\nS\nST 00 00\nO S 0 0\nL C CP 12 12\nTOTA ADBI 12000030000 169000 10000 10000 22000 75000 436000 Costs ns, including\n0000 00 00 00  00 00 00 ect  utio\nADB 540160 1890 50 50 10 300 3000 Total Proj cted contrib\ne\n  00 0 0 0 0 0 Proj\nAN Follow-upSeminars ADB 54001600 500 500 100 900 9000 contributions. \nCING PL UNDP 20000 5000 2000 27000 e in-kind \nCOST ESTIMATE AND FINAN$ Governance ConferencePublic Sector Mgt.for Senior Executivesfor Parliamentarians  ADBESCAPUNDPADBADBICPSItem 1.
