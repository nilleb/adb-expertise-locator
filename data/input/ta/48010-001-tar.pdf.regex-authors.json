INTRODUCTION \n1.  During  the  2013  country  programming  mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide technical \nassistance  (TA)  for  a  Study  on  Local  Financial  Market  Development  and  Supervisory \nFramework.1 Following a fact-finding mission in June 2014, ADB and the government reached \nan understanding on the objectives, scope, implementation arrangements, costs, and terms of \nreference for the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The PRC\u2019s successful transition to a market-based economy has resulted in remarkable \neconomic  growth.  The  country\u2019s  financial  system  contributed  to  this  growth;  its  rapid \ndevelopment  was  attributed  to  various  successful  financial  sector  reforms  by  the  central \ngovernment. However, the national financial system of the PRC is still dominated by banks\u2014\ntotal credit provided by the banking system reached 160% of gross domestic product (GDP) in \n2012, whereas the stock market\u2019s overall capitalization was 45% of GDP and insurance sector \nassets accounted for less than 10% of GDP. The government\u2019s recent policy shift to quality, \nbalanced, and sustainable economic growth called for the development of regional and local \neconomies across different provinces, and the role of provincial and local governments has \nbecome more important. Regional3 or local financial institutions developed to meet local needs, \nespecially micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises and rural households. The local financial \nmarkets  have  become  more  diversified  thanks  to  city  commercial  banks,  rural  credit \ncooperatives, village and township banks, microcredit companies, guarantee companies, and \nregional  over-the-counter  (OTC)  equity  markets.  However,  no  concrete  studies  have  been \ncarried out to assess the local and regional financial markets development and to define an \neffective  regulatory  and  supervisory  framework  promoting  more  locally  diversified  financial \nmarkets. \n \n3.  Despite the rapid economic growth of the country as a whole, the uneven economic \ngrowth in different regions and provinces has been a major concern for policymakers and \nacademic researchers. Research was conducted to determine the factors that contribute to \nprovincial and regional economic growth. Although empirical literature had been pointing to \nvarious factors for some time, the disparity in financial sector development and its effects across \nthe provinces and regions has become more highlighted in recent studies.4 The PRC\u2019s financial \nsystem  is  still  dominated  by  major  state-owned  and  large  nationwide  commercial  banks, \ntransferring the deposited funds from underdeveloped inland regions to more developed coastal \nprovinces. In contrast, smaller and more locally focused financial institutions that form part of \nprovincial and regional financial markets have more efficiently channeled funds to individuals \nand industries in the region. As a consequence, policymakers are now trying to determine the \ncorrelations between local and regional financial market development and local and regional \n                                                \n1  The TA is included in ADB. 2014. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2014\u20132016. \nManila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 1 October 2014. \n3  In this report, \u201cregion\u201d refers to an area that  consists of geographically neighboring provinces with similar \nagricultural or industrial base and characteristics. The distinction is made between local, provincial, regional, and \nnational financial markets, since financial markets and systems often develop at different levels to support local, \nprovincial, regional, and national economic activities. \n4  Peng, Jing, Li, and Yu. 2008. Regional Finance and Regional Disparities in China, China Economic Review; and C. \nHao. 2006., Development of Financial Intermediation and Economic Growth: The Chinese Experience. China \nEconomic Review. \n ", "2   \neconomic development, and the preconditions and specific policy measures taken to promote \nthe regional financial markets. This will enable them to formulate an appropriate development \nstrategy and policies. Liaoning Province is ideally suited to a case study, given its unique \nindustrial development history and relatively well-diversified financial markets, which include \nstate-owned banks, local commercial banks, securities and insurance companies, rural financial \ninstitutions, and OTC stock markets. Lessons from the case study in Liaoning Province could be \napplied to other local and regional financial markets in the PRC. \n \n4.  The PRC lacks a policy stance on how supervisory and regulatory authority should be \nassigned to central and provincial regulators, and this, too, requires a systematic study. The \ncurrent financial regulatory structure in the PRC is subsector-based; as the central bank, the \nPeople\u2019s Bank of China is responsible for monetary policy and the stability of the financial \nsystem  in general,  while  the  China  Banking  Regulatory  Commission, the  China  Securities \nRegulatory  Commission,  and  the  China  Insurance  Regulatory  Commission  are  central \nauthorities responsible for regulating the banking, securities, and insurance subsectors. Since \n2008, the decentralization of financial supervision has gradually begun. This was reinforced by \nthe PRC\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u201320155, which set out the goal of improving local \nfinancial management systems and strengthening the responsibility of provincial governments \nfor managing the local small and medium-sized financial institutions. In 2012, former Premier \nWen  Jiabao  also  proposed  to  strengthen  the  provincial  governments\u2019  awareness  of  and \nresponsibility for financial supervision. As a result, the provincial governments were empowered \nwith supervising authority for microcredit companies, new rural financial institutions, and credit \nguarantee companies based on the China Banking Regulatory Commission\u2019s regulations. In \n2012, the State Council and the China Securities Regulatory Commission vested provincial \ngovernments with the authority to oversee regional OTC markets. However, the absence of \nsystematic research on how to decentralize financial regulation and supervision in the PRC, and \nthe lack of in-depth analysis and a clear plan to assign these responsibilities among central and \nprovincial authorities have created uncertainty and the need for strategic directions. \n \n5.   Aligned with the PRC\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year Plan, ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, \n2011\u20132015 for the PRC identifies inclusive growth as one of the strategic pillars. The TA \nsupports inclusive growth by improving access to finance through the development of local \nfinancial markets and by enhancing the supervisory and regulatory framework. This TA builds \non the findings and lessons from the continuous ADB supports on this area such as TAs to \nimprove capacity of the statistical competence of local financial institutions6 and development of \nrural financial system and supervision. 7  \n \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The impact will be the development of more effective and sustainable local financial \nsystems. The outcome will be the successful implementation of local and regional financial \nsector and regulatory reforms based on the study outputs of the TA. \n \n                                                \n5 Approved in March 2011 by National People\u2019s Congress \n6 ADB. 2012.

The TA consulting team will prepare a main report on local financial market development \nand a supervisory framework. The report will include (i) an overview of the PRC\u2019s local and \nregional financial markets with clear definitions and data as general background, (ii) an analysis \nof the history and conditions of local and regional financial market development based on the \nsurvey conducted among locally or regionally focused financial institutions in Liaoning Province, \n(iii) in-depth analysis of the impact of the local financial industry on the economic and social \ndevelopment in Liaoning Province, (iv) lessons from exploring international case studies and \ngood practices through desk studies and an international study tour in two selected countries \nthat have successfully decentralized regulatory authority, and (v) recommendations and a road \nmap for reforms needed to promote local and regional financial market development with a \nmore efficient and decentralized regulatory system. Outputs for (i), (iii), and (iv) of the main \nreport will be separately published as sub-reports, and as knowledge products and services \n(policy briefs) for policymakers. \n \n8.  The TA consulting team will also prepare a report with policy recommendations for \nformulating a road map and business strategy for Liaoning Province\u2019s regional OTC market. The \nreport will (i) review the role and regulatory structure of the regional OTC markets in the PRC, (ii) \ndefine an efficient regulatory and supervisory regime, and (iii) provide a clear business and \npolicy road map to promote a regional OTC market in Liaoning Province. \n \n9.  The TA will help strengthen the capacity of provincial regulatory authorities. A study tour, \nseminars, and workshops will be organized to also boost the Liaoning provincial government\u2019s \ncapacity  to  handle  the  issues  that  arise  from  local  financial  market  development  and  a \ndecentralized supervisory and regulatory system. Market participants and central and provincial \nsupervisory authorities will be invited as well. A final dissemination workshop will allow industry \nexperts, government officials, and regulators to share their views and provide feedback on the \nreports. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.  The TA is estimated to cost $440,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of staff time, access to data sources, assistance to field \ntrips  and  meetings,  use  of  office  space  and  facilities,  logistical  support,  and  other  in-kind \ncontributions. \n \nD.
