The Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam (the Government) requested \nassistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the capacity building of the Ministry \nof Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE) and Electricity of Viet Nam (EVN) for the \nstrategic  environmental  assessment  (SEA)  of  the  hydropower  sector.  The  Management \ncleared the TA concept paper on 16 September 2005. A fact-finding mission visited Viet \nNam and reached an understanding with the Government on the objective, scope, costs, \nfinancing, and implementation arrangements for the technical assistance (TA).1 The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n2.   The TA focuses on building the capacity of MONRE and EVN in the hydropower \nsector to achieve sustainable energy development in Viet Nam. The sector, theme, and \ntargeting classification of the TA is in Appendix 2. The TA is targeted at building the SEA \ncapacity of MONRE and EVN in hydropower project development. It is in line with MONRE\u2019s \ncurrent  policy  to  amend  its  legislative  requirements  to  include  the  SEA  mandate. \nAdditionally,  the  TA  is  consistent  with  an  ADB-led  donors\u2019  effort  to  harmonize  the \nenvironmental safeguard requirement to reflect the country system in Viet Nam, and other \ndocuments.2  \n \n3.  The implementation of the proposed TA is linked to the processing of the proposed \nNorthern Power Transmission Expansion Sector Project (NPTESP) and the Song Bung 4 \nHydropower  Project.  Capacity  for  SEA  review  and  monitoring  in  MONRE  will  help  the \nGovernment understand and manage better the impact of the hydropower sector. EVN \ncapacity in SEA preparation can also be extended to other power projects in Viet Nam. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.   Electricity demand in Viet Nam has grown at an annual rate of 15% between 2000 \nand 2005 and will continue to grow at this rate until 2010, and at 12% until 2015. To meet \nthis demand for electricity, the Government expects to double currently installed generating \ncapacity from 10,871 megawatt (MW) in 2004 to 22,600 MW by 2010. In addition, the \ncapacity of high-voltage and medium-voltage transmission and distribution systems needs to \nbe improved to address transmission bottlenecks and reduce losses. The power sector \nmaster plan of EVN for 2000\u20132010 emphasizes the importance of developing hydropower \nalong with other generation technologies, mainly because of the country\u2019s abundant water \nresources potential and the cheaper generation cost. However, large hydropower projects \nlike  the  Son  La  and  Son  Bung  4  hydropower  plants  are  expected  to  have  significant \nenvironmental and social impacts, including cumulative impacts downstream.  \n \n5.    ADB\u2019s  past  involvement  in  the  power  sector  in  Viet  Nam  has  focused  on  the \nextension and rehabilitation of substations and distribution networks. To support EVN\u2019s long-\nterm need for growth in generation and distribution capacity, ADB approved the $120 million \nNorthern Power Transmission Sector Project to improve the reliability and quality of supply \nof a high-voltage transmission network in the Northern Region. A follow-up project, the \nNPTESP, is being prepared to further strengthen the transmission network and enable the \nevacuation of power from generation projects now being constructed, improve North\u2013South \ntransmission, and reduce system losses. Further ADB assistance to the sector will be for \npower generation projects like the Song Bung 4 Hydropower Project. Since ADB\u2019s focus in \nthepowersector over the next 5\u201310 years will be in power generation, there is a need to \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 18 September 2005. \n2  ADB. 2005 Country Strategy Program Update (2006\u20132008): Viet Nam. Manila \n ", "2   \nassist the country in building its capacity to understand and address comprehensively the \nimpact of such projects, and support sustainable power sector development. MONRE has \nindicated strong interest in capacity building in cumulative impact assessment (CIA) as part \nof overall strategic environmental assessment, especially in the hydropower sector. EVN has \nalso acknowledged its limited capacity in CIA preparation and requested assistance.  \n \n6.  A discussion paper on CIA was circulated within ADB in March 2005 and shared with \nother development partner. CIA, as part of SEA, can be defined as examining the aggregate \nindirect, induced, synergistic, and trans-boundary impact on the environment of planned and \nidentified development projects in the same geographic region within a specified time frame. \nA  CIA  can  be  both  evaluative  (for  a  project  or  series  of  projects)  and  advisory  (for \ncomprehensive development purposes). For a region like a watershed area, it is beneficial to \nunderstand the overall cumulative impact of the major planned interventions and use the \nresults to guide future planning. The SEA, as an overarching assessment approach, focuses \non examining the impact of either sector-wide or program-/policy-based development by \nusing tools like CIA and other assessment methods. The outcome of an SEA generally \nprovides policy makers with insights into the overall environmental impact, alternatives, and \nrisks of the sector (e.g., hydropower) or program development at the policy level.  \n \n7.  Both EVN and MONRE have requested assistance from ADB in SEA and CIA, \nespecially for projects that are directly financed by ADB and other donors or linked to \nprojects (such as transmission lines) financed by them. The hydropower sector was selected \nfor  the  SEA/CIA  exercise  because  EVN  aims  to  develop  its  capacity  through  active \ninvolvement in this sector in the next 5 years, given the sector\u2019s identified importance in the \nGovernment\u2019s Master Plan V (2000\u20132010) and the National Hydropower Plan. In addition, \nADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy  recognizes  the  value  of  hydropower  as  a  renewable  resource \nappropriate for ADB support, provided safeguard requirements are addressed. Building the \ncapacity  of  EVN  in  SEA/CIA  will  help  it  to  plan  sounder  projects  with  comprehensive \nconsideration of risk and impact. In the case of MONRE, capacity building will help the \nministry make strategic policy decisions on mitigation and project review/approval. The pilot \nSEA/CIA studies in the TA could become showcases for the planning and development of \nfuture power projects. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The purpose of the TA is to (i) build the capacity of relevant Vietnamese agencies \n(chiefly MONRE and EVN and its related agencies) to enhance their performance in SEA \npreparation, review, approval, and implementation; (ii) ensure that the capacity building is \nsustainable  so  that  future  projects  and  development  programs  may  benefit  from  the \naccumulated experience of MONRE and EVN; and (iii) share the lessons learned with other \ndevelopment  partners  including  donors,  civil  society,  and  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs). The overall purpose is to support a long-term hydropower development scheme \nthat is sustainable, environmentally sound, and sensitive to the overall impact and risks. This \nTA will complement the proposed ADB TA for the implementation of an environmental \nmanagement plan for the Song La Hydropower Project. \n \n9.  The proposed TA project will focus on the following outputs: (i) assessment of the \nneed for CIA/SEA capacity; (ii) capacity-building activities, including on-the job training and a \nstudy tour; (iii) common understanding of the methods, coverage, and directions of the pilot \nCIAs/SEAs through the collection and analysis of such practices in the hydropower sector; \n(iv)  pilot  CIA/SEA  studies  for  targeted  areas  and  projects;  (v)  review  workshops; \n ", "  3\n(vi) dissemination of information and public disclosure of adequately prepared reports; and \n(vii) regular follow-up of the staff\u2019s capacity-building results. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  Various methods such as desk reviews, field surveys, workshops, policy dialogues, \nand consultations will be used to achieve the intended TA outputs. Since the pilot CIA/SEA \nstudies  are  considered  case  studies,  specific  case  study  methods  will  be  used.  The \nparticipatory approach will be given priority when developing mitigation programs and policy \nrecommendations as part of the CIA/SEA results. The TA will be implemented over 12 \nmonths, with its first activity being the establishment of a steering committee. The committee \nmembers will come from MONRE, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Planning and Investment \n(MPI),  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development,  Ministry  of  Fisheries,  provincial \ndepartments of agriculture and rural development and natural resources and environment, \nprovincial and district people\u2019s committees, and EVN. \n11.  A team of consultants will provide technical assistance services to implement the \nProject. One out of two areas now being considered will be chosen as pilot area for the \nCIA/SEA capacity-building activities. The first is the Da River basin in Northern Viet Nam; the \nother is the Vu-Gia Thu Bon River basin in Central Viet Nam. The Da River basin is being \nconsidered not only because many donors (including ADB) have planned or committed \ninterventions in the basin and need to understand the cumulative impact of each intervention \non overall development, but also because the river basin contains many environmentally \nsensitive  protected  areas  with  high  biodiversity  values.  The  largest  hydropower  station \nplanned for the country, the Son La Hydropower Project (SLHPP), is in that basin as part of \nthe master plan for the hydropower development cascades of the Da River. The Vu-Gia Thu \nBon River basin, on the other hand, could also be a pilot area because ADB is considering \nfinancing the Song Bung 4 Hydropower Project, one of several hydropower projects in the \nriver basin that could have comprehensive impact downstream of the dam site. The river \nbasin is also in a biodiversity conservation corridor with high ecological values that was \nendorsed by the GMS summit in June 2005. \n \n12.  The TA activities will specifically involve (i) assessing the weaknesses and needs of \nboth  MONRE  and  EVN  in  CIA/SEA  capacity  (including  a  review  of  existing  studies); \n(ii) reviewing relevant policies and legislation (and recent studies on them) to identify gaps \nand opportunities in conducting CIAs/SEAs in the current Vietnamese institutional context; \n(iii) reaching common understanding on the specific pilot area, methods, coverage, and \ndirections of the pilot CIAs/SEAs through the collection and analysis of such practices in the \nhydropower  sector;  (iv)  conducting  pilot  CIA/SEA  studies  in  the  identified  pilot  area; \n(v) identifying appropriate roles for the MONRE and EVN organization and staff in CIA/SEA, \nand suggesting opportunities to strengthen those roles with the involvement of the provincial \ndepartments of natural resources and environment (DONREs); (vi) training MONRE/EVN \nstaff, with emphasis on practical on-the-job experience; (vii) organizing workshops to review \nthe pilot study reports and disseminate the results; (viii) organizing a regional study tour for \nselected staff of MONRE, EVN, and relevant agencies such as DONREs (for maximum \nvalue and complementarity, the study tour will be integrated with the study tour for another \nTA for EVN\u2019s Son La environmental management plan); (ix) procuring key project equipment \nincluding  relevant  geographical  information  system  (GIS)  and  other  facilities;  and \n(x) providing recommendations for ADB\u2019s operations in Viet Nam, and outreach to partners \n(including donors and civil society) to disseminate the policy recommendations. \n \n13.  An  updated  list  of  planned  and  committed  interventions  from  donors  and  the \nGovernment will be compiled and the relevant documents will be reviewed against the \n   ", "4   \noverall development scenario. The pilot study will be done in one of the two river basins now \nbeing considered, and its coverage will be up to 2025. The study will include (i) an overall \nassessment of the cumulative impact of all interventions planned and committed; (ii) an \nassessment of the specific contribution of the ADB\u2019s proposed interventions; (iii) policy \nrecommendations to MPI and donors; and (iv) consultations with relevant stakeholders and \nNGOs. The interventions referred to will be selected at the start of the TA and the selections \nwill be confirmed by ADB. Policy recommendations will involve specific statements on the \npotential impact of the identified projects and the needed mitigation measures. Consultations \nwill be held in selected provinces and Hanoi, and will be documented. As part of the efforts \nto reach a common understanding on CIA/SEA approaches, ADB in 2004 started a pilot CIA \nexercise, one of its first, for the Nam Theun II Hydropower project in the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, with particular focus on hydrology, conservation, fishery, transport, \nand urban development. The lessons learned from that exercise will be used in the proposed \npilot activities under the TA. The extensive SEA experiences of the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina can also very well be shared during the TA. \n \n14.  The consultants will provide interim and final reports, and disseminate summary \nreports (in both Vietnamese and English) to stakeholders through workshops and Web sites \nafter approval by ADB, as part of the public communication and disclosure process. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA total cost is estimated at $650,000 equivalent\u2014$400,000 in foreign exchange \ncost and $250,000 in local currency cost. The Government has requested ADB to finance \n$475,000 equivalent, comprising the entire foreign exchange cost and a portion of the local \ncurrency cost. This amount will be financed on a grant basis by the Government of Finland \nand administered by ADB. The Government of Viet Nam will finance the remaining $175,000 \nequivalent in local currency cost through in-kind contributions. Detailed cost estimates and a \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be MONRE, and EVN will co-chair the steering \ncommittee to be formed for the TA. The TA, to be implemented over 12 months, from \nDecember 2005 to December 2006, will require 25 person-months of consulting services\u2014\n13 person-months of international consulting services and 12 person-months of domestic \nconsulting services. The consultants will be recruited according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the \nUse of Consultants and other arrangements acceptable to ADB for engaging domestic \nconsultants. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \nIV. THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $475,000  to  the \nGovernment of Viet Nam to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of Finland, for \nCapacity Building in the Strategic Environmental Assessment of the Hydropower Sector, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "      \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \n       \nDesign Summary  Performance Indicators/Targets  Monitoring  Assumptions   \n  Mechanisms  and Risks \n   \nImpact  Five years after the TA:     \n       \nEnvironmentally sensitive power  SEA/CIA of hydropower projects has  Regulations of the   \ngeneration development with  been systematically adopted, and the  Government of Viet \nemphasis on sustainable  review and approval process is  Nam on hydropower \ndevelopment  established in MONRE  generation projects and \n  environmental \n  assessment for SEA \n     \nOutcome  After the TA:     \n      Assumptions \nBest SEA/CIA practice is  The SEA/CIA best practice is  Consultants\u2019 reports,  The Government is committed to implementing the \ndelivered and monitored  recognized and accepted by  monitoring reports, and  SEA/CIA on a pilot basis  \n  MONRE/EVN.    feedback from the   \nAdequate SEA/CIA capacity is    steering committee, and  Steering committee participates fully  \nbuilt in MONRE/EVN.
