The microfinance risk participation and guarantee program (MFP), approved in 2010, fills \na market gap by sharing risks with accredited partner financial institutions (PFIs) to facilitate local \ncurrency lending to the microfinance sector. Due to the program\u2019s success and increased market \ndemand, the ADB\u2019s Board of Directors removed the program expiration date and included it into \nADB\u2019s mainstream operations in 2015. An additional program limit of $100 million (bringing the \nprogram\u2019s overall limit to $340 million) and major change in scope for the program was approved \nby ADB\u2019s Board of Directors on 13 December 2017.1 To expand the program into different \ncountries with microfinance sectors at varying levels of maturity and to continue to facilitate \nfunding to MFIs in existing countries varying strategies and broader product offerings are required.  \nPrimarily this will be through supporting microfinance institutions (MFIs) (i) to access domestic \ncapital markets and (i) to increase their financial services range. It will also require broadening \nthe type of PFIs to work with. As of end December 2017, the program has supported $638 million \nof  new  local  currency  loans  (including  cofinancing  of  $336  million),  reaching  3.49  million \nborrowers, mostly women.  \n \n2.  With the increased limit and the introduction of new products, ADB plans to expand further \nin the region and support MFIs in diversifying their funding sources and product offerings to reach \nmore of the unbanked population in Asia and the Pacific. ADB recently accredited Maybank as a \nnew PFI for Myanmar and is in the process to accredit a new PFI for Sri Lanka. The program is \nalso looking to expand to Pakistan in 2018.  To support these ongoing initiatives, a transaction \ntechnical assistance cluster (TRTA) in the amount of $2.0 million was approved in December \n2017. The first subproject in the amount of $500,000 was also approved in December 2017. \nSeveral consultant positions to support the expansion and the MFP team have been advertised. \nGuarantee and capital markets experts will start in April 2018 and a transaction support analyst \nwill start in May 2018. The expansion and implementation of new products will be further \nsupported through the technical assistance (TA), Subproject 2. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUBPROJECT \n \nA.  Overall Progress of the Technical Assistance Cluster \n \n3.  This is the second subproject under the Microfinance Risk Participation and Guarantee \nProgram Transaction Support for Expansion. \n \nB.  Subproject Scope  \n \n4.  The cluster TA has as its overall outcome: sustainable financial inclusion increased. \nThrough a combination of funding instruments, MFIs will receive more financing for lending to the \nlower income people who are predominately women, and PFIs will be more comfortable to lend \ndirectly to this market segment. To enable MFIs to diversify their funding sources and product \nofferings, this subproject will support guarantee and risk participation product readiness to credit \nenhance  bonds  and  securitizations  issued  by  MFIs.  It  will  also  support  identification  and \nonboarding of new MFIs on a needs basis, and evaluation of potential new PFIs.

Manila  \n \n ", "2   \nwill also include some contingency consulting budget to flexibly address upcoming needs during \nimplementation. \n \nC.  Subproject Outputs and Activities  \n \n5.  Output 1: Identification, evaluation and preparation of potential new PFIs and MFIs to be \naccredited under the MFP, including capacity building as needed. This will include legal support \nfor (i) analysis of legal and regulatory environments in a new country, (ii) support to the MFP in \nthe onboarding process of a new PFI, (iii) preparation of legal documentation and agreements, \nand  (iv)  international  legal  expertise  for  capital  market  transactions.  In  addition,  it  will  be \nnecessary to support the MFP in the evaluation of potential new MFIs for the program.  It is \nestimated that ADB will include 10-15 more MFIs in the program in the next two years. The \nincreased number of transactions and volume will also require support in integrity due diligence, \nportfolio  monitoring  and  reporting,  program  administration  and  communications.  One  legal \nconsultant, one financial analyst, one transactions support analyst and one legal firm on a retainer \nbasis will be needed. If necessary, the input will be complemented by an MFI and banking expert \nto assist in due diligence preparation and capacity building of PFIs.  \n \n5.  Output  2:  Identification,  evaluation,  structuring  and  preparation  of  capital  market \ninstruments and other guarantee/risk participation products to be guaranteed under the MFP. \nAssist in the identification, evaluation, structuring and preparation of capital market instruments \nand other guarantee/risk participation products to be guaranteed under the MFP.  To further \ncomplement  and  support  the  implementation  readiness  of  the  new  guarantee  and  risk \nparticipation products, it will be necessary to identify suitable loss estimation models that are \napplicable for securitization transactions. Initially, there will be a small number of securitizations.  \nADB may therefore rely on a few external providers (such as a rating agency) for estimation of \nlosses and subsequent ratings of the underlying portfolio. A firm will be required to evaluate the \ndifferent tools and validate 1 to 2 options. As necessary, the guarantee or capital market experts \ninput might have to be extended. \n \n6.  Output 3: Disseminating sector information and other knowledge products to a broader \naudience. With the expansion of the MFP it will be important to apprise stakeholders on expansion \nactivities, sector information and performance highlights. This will be achieved through a range of \nactivities, such as website updates, blogs and other media promotions. Awareness activities for \nthe program and particularly for the new guarantee products (structures, evaluations techniques, \nrisk assessments) will be disseminated to a broader audience, such as ADB\u2019s financial sector \ngroup and other external stakeholders2 through a series of workshops. \n \nD.  Subproject Cost and Financing \n7.  The TA subproject is estimated to cost $1,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Others). The funds will cover remuneration, \ntravel,  and  per  diem  for  international  consultants,  conference  related  expenditures,  and \nmiscellaneous expenses.  \n \nE.  Subproject Implementation Arrangements \n8.  ADB will administer Subproject 2 and its Private Sector Operations Department, Financial \nInstitutions Division, will select, supervise and evaluate consultants.  \n                                                \n2  For example, for expansion to new countries ADB will conduct in-country workshops on the program. \n ", "3 \n \nTable 1: Subproject 2 Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative implementation  June 2018 \u2013 December 2020 \nperiod \nExecuting agency  ADB \nImplementing agencies  PSOD, PSFI \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nLegal Expert (national)  Individual selection  ADB, Subproject 2 \nLegal Expert  Firm on retainer basis  ADB, Subproject 2 \n(international) \nMFI Financial Analyst  Individual selection  ADB, Subproject 2 \n(Indian national) \nTransaction Support  Individual selection  ADB, Subproject 2 \nAnalyst (IDD) \n(national) \nValidation Expert  Firm service contract  ADB, Subproject 2 \n(international) \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n9.
