INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the implementation of \nthe Government of India\u2019s national health protection mission Ayushman Bharat, and particularly \nits component Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY), to accelerate the achievement of \nuniversal health coverage (UHC) in the country. The TA will also provide short-term support for \nmanaging the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic through private sector engagement, \nand strengthen the preparedness and resilience of the health system to tackle future exigencies. \n \n2.  The TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 Operational Plan for Priority 1\u2014addressing \nremaining poverty and reducing inequalities\u2014because its support for the government's UHC \nefforts will help improve the quality and coverage of public and private health care services, and \nensure that the poor and vulnerable are not left behind.1 The TA will also help the government \nmeet its commitments to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 3.8, which \nentails achieving UHC.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  India has experienced robust growth since the 1980s, adding on average 7.5% to its gross \ndomestic product since 2011 and making it one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies. This \ngrowth has been inclusive\u2014India more than halved its poverty rate since 1993, and achieved \nmost of the Millennium Development Goals. It made significant strides in the health sector. Life \nexpectancy exceeds 68 years, and the infant and under-five mortality rates are declining, as is \nthe rate of disease incidence. Many diseases such as polio, guinea worm disease and tetanus \nhave been eradicated.2 The government\u2019s health spending has steadily risen to 30% of the \ncountry\u2019s total health expenditure, 10% higher than in 2005.3  \n \n4.  Despite these achievements, India still faces significant challenges. Health indicators are \nshowing gradual progress toward meeting the SDGs. The maternal mortality ratio and infant \nmortality rate are still unacceptably high. Communicable diseases remain a major public health \nproblem, while noncommunicable diseases are the leading cause of death. Inequalities in access \nto health services still exist, translating into significant disparities in health indicators within and \nacross states. Public health infrastructure and services are overburdened. More than 60% of the \npopulation relies on private sector services because of a lack of high-quality care, shortage of \ndrugs, and poor service delivery in public hospitals. Although the private hospitals are easily \naccessible, the costs for their services are high, resulting in catastrophic out-of-pocket health \nexpenditure that imposes a disproportionate burden on the poor.  \n \n5.  To overcome health inequalities and improve health outcomes, India is pursuing a multi-\nstakeholder engagement in the design and delivery of an inclusive and pluralistic UHC-driven \nhealth care system. In 2011, a high-level expert group's report emphasized that the government \nshould act as the guarantor and enabler and not as the sole provider of services.4 In 2017, India \n \n1 ADB. 2018.

New \nDelhihttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3354908/ (accessed 04 May 2020). \n ", "2 \nformulated the National Health Policy, clearly outlining the intent of achieving UHC.5 Focused on \nincreasing government health financing to 2.5% of gross domestic product by 2025, the policy \nhighlights the need to (i) increase public health infrastructure; (ii) expand free access to essential \ndrugs, diagnostics, and emergency services; (iii) encourage private sector participation for service \ndelivery; (iv) strengthen the health information system; and (v) develop the capacity for health \ntechnology assessments.6  \n \n6.  The recommendations of the National Health Policy led to the establishment of Ayushman \nBharat in 2018 with the aim to provide equitable access to quality health services. Ayushman \nBharat is designed to target and eliminate service delivery gaps in a dual pronged approach. First, \nin  April  2018,  it  began  providing  comprehensive  primary  health  care  services  (ambulatory \ndiagnostic, curative, rehabilitative, and palliative) through health and wellness centers close to \nthe people. Second, in September 2018, it launched PM-JAY to deliver inpatient health care \nservices and health financing for the vulnerable through the implementation and expansion of \nstrategic purchasing instruments of government-sponsored health insurance programs. PM-JAY \nprovides  financial  protection  for  secondary  and  tertiary  care  to  about  40%  of India's  poor \nhouseholds.7 This initiative has become pivotal in living up to the promise of UHC. Within the first \nyear of PM-JAY implementation, more than five million Indians benefited from the scheme, \nwhereby  hospitalized  care  is  delivered  through  nearly  18,000  health  care  establishments \nempanelled under PM-JAY.8 This sudden surge in demand, however, is stretching the fragile \nhealth system and is likely to affect the quality of service delivery.  \n \n7.  The  outbreak  of  the  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19),  which  the  World  Health \nOrganization declared as a pandemic on 11 March 2020, underscored the need for stronger \npreparedness of India's health system. India\u2019s capacity in the key areas of early disease detection, \nwhich is crucial to arresting disease transmission, ranks lower than that of its peers. As the scale \nof the pandemic increased, the need for involving the private sector more strategically in the \noverall health management became acute.9  \n \n8.  PM-JAY  has  evolved  as  a  key  pillar  for  achieving  UHC,  particularly for the  overall \nmanagement of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the health system is being challenged by the \nextent of the pandemic. For one, while millions of test kits were imported from overseas, not \nenough government laboratories exist to test for the presence of the virus. Given the increasing \ndemand for COVID-19 care, engaging the private sector in the provision of services is imperative. \nThrough PM-JAY, more than 500 million beneficiaries are now entitled to free COVID-19 testing \nand  treatment  at  designated  private  and  public  health facilities.  This support  needs to  be \nexpanded to more beneficiaries and more private hospitals.  \n \n9.  The TA aims to sustain the efforts under PM-JAY to redefine India's health care system \nby drawing from global best practices in digital solutions and financing, including experiences in \nhealth system reforms of developed countries such as the Republic of Korea; and strengthening \n \n5 Government of India. 2018.

Ayushman Bharat will strengthen India's efforts toward achieving Universal Health Coverage. \n9  As of 19 April 2020, according to the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, India had reported 16,116 COVID-19 cases \nnationwide (also affecting 77 foreign nationals). Of these, 2,301 people were cured and discharged, 1 patient was \nmigrated, and 519 died. Hospital isolation of all confirmed cases, and tracing and home quarantine of the contacts \nwere ongoing. \n ", "3 \nthe capacity for developing and managing an integrated, efficient, and modern health care system \nthat is capable of handling pandemics and securing better and more equitable access.10 The TA \naims to help bridge gaps in the implementation of PM-JAY and India's efforts to achieve UHC. It \nwill enable ADB to undertake analytical studies on key operational and regulatory issues, which \nwill in turn underpin the operational efficiency of PM-JAY and the attainment of UHC.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA will have the following outcome: strengthened UHC for better access to quality \nsecondary and tertiary health care services, and improved preparedness for the COVID-19 \npandemic. The TA will be aligned with the following impact: universal access to equitable, \naffordable, and responsive quality health care attained. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  The TA has four outputs:  \n \n12.  Output  1:  Recommendations  for  digital  solutions  to  improve  the  operational \nefficiency  of  PM-JAY  implementation  formulated.  The  TA  team  will  take  a  multisector \napproach to progress toward UHC. The solutions will be driven by demand since ADB will be \nworking closely with India's National Health Authority (NHA) and other stakeholders. Specifically, \nthe TA will (i) assess information technology gaps and develop digital systems to enable effective \nand  operationally  efficient  health  care  administration  (including  claims  management,  fraud \ndetection, and purchasing); (ii) propose ways for purchasing digital solutions; (iii) develop legal \nguidelines; and (iv) recommend policy and regulatory adjustments to enable the proposed digital \nsolutions. The TA will also provide training to staff and officials (including women) at the NHA and \nnational health entities to enhance their capacity for using and managing digital solutions. The \noutput has two key components:  \n(a) Claims management and fraud detection processes improved. PM-JAY has a critical \ncomponent  of  claims  processing  using  a  digital  platform.  The  TA  will  support  the \nformulation of solutions for digital medical auditing tools in claims management, and the \nintegration of a medico-legal framework in the overall system flow for better monitoring \nand greater accountability.  \n(b) Strategic  purchasing  through  digital  interventions  supported.  The  TA  will  help \ndevelop digital solutions for the strategic purchasing of care, particularly by leveraging \neconomies of scale to increase affordability, and by drawing from global best practices. \nThe purchasing solutions can be mainstreamed to support the large-scale negotiations \nrequired  for  the  procurement  of  consumables  and  drugs.  The  TA  will  also  assist \nknowledge exchange activities to adopt best practices from other systems based on the \nnational health insurance model, with a focus on the Republic of Korea.   \n \n13.  Output 2: Innovative models of financing and service delivery developed. Although \nthe start-up ecosystem in India is growing rapidly and attracting significant investments, the \necosystem for health innovations is still at a nascent stage. This output will explore and propose \n \n10 ADB provided support to the NHA under small-scale technical assistance totaling $225,000\u2014ADB. 2019. Technical \nAssistance to India for Supporting the National Health Authority. Manila\u2014by strengthening NHA processes and \ninstitutional arrangements and enabling access to innovation financing for health service providers that are partnering \nwith the NHA in implementing PM-JAY. The new TA incorporates lessons from the earlier TA, such as putting in \nplace digital health tools and systems to improve access to financing and the overall implementation of PM-JAY.    \n ", "4 \ninnovative health financing models to fill supply-side gaps and meet the increasing demand. The \nTA team will explore approaches to mobilizing resources for the development and rehabilitation \nof facilities. It will also help build an innovation-focused ecosystem to fill gaps in service delivery, \ndevelop a network of partnerships, support expert forums, and provide a platform for knowledge \nexchange. Data disaggregated by gender, age groups, and social groups will be collected, \ncompiled, and analyzed for the end beneficiaries, such as patients. \n \n14.  Output 3: Framework and strategies developed to strengthen states\u2019 capacity for \nimplementation. PM-JAY is designed as a sophisticated model for the provision of insurance \ncoverage; however, it gives states the flexibility to modify it depending on their available expertise \nand capacity. Engaging with the end beneficiaries and providing opportunities for patient-reported \noutcomes are likely to enhance the quality of service delivery and improve citizen engagement, \nas is the case in the Republic of Korea. This output will strengthen the states\u2019 capacity for \nimproved implementation, including better monitoring and evaluation. The TA team will design a \nstrategy for stronger capacity and engagement across the spectrum of stakeholders, as well as a \nstrategy for last-mile beneficiary awareness, and develop a comprehensive framework for internal \nknowledge management. The TA will also support information, education, and communication \nactivities for more informed decision making on the part of the PM-JAY beneficiaries. \n \n15.  Output  4:  Framework  and  strategies  developed  to  strengthen  private  sector \nresponse to COVID-19 pandemic. PM-JAY is designed as a health care program involving both \npublic and private service providers. Its current network includes more than 21,000 empaneled \nhospitals, of which about 50% are private. In events like the COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial for \nthe entire health system to participate in the overall response. PM-JAY indeed mobilized the \nparticipation  of  private  entities  in  providing  COVID-19  testing  and  treatment  to  more  than \n500 million PM-JAY beneficiaries. The TA will strengthen this partnership by installing a system \nfor efficient communication and robust private sector network management. PM-JAY beneficiaries \nwill be given free access to COVID-19 testing and treatment, and key information will be \ndisseminated especially to the poor and vulnerable groups such as women, disadvantaged social \ngroups, and residents of underserved areas. The TA team will develop an implementation \nframework that ensures COVID-19 testing and treatment as well as monitoring and evaluation \nacross all geographic areas, including those now underserved.11  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, of which (i) $200,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources), and (ii) $500,000 will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund \nand administered by ADB.12 Appendix 2 lists the key expenditure items. \n \n17.  The government will provide counterpart support of $50,000 in the form of counterpart \nstaff, workshop venues, office accommodation, office supplies, secretarial assistance, domestic \ntransportation, capacity building of private hospitals, and other in-kind contributions. \n \n \n11  The PM-JAY empanelment criteria for hospitals include compliance with India\u2019s Bio-Medical Waste Management \nAct. Periodic checks will ensure that the hospitals strictly follow the requirements, including those relating to COVID-\n19. Capacity building of private hospitals participating in the management of the COVID-19 pandemic will be financed \nthrough counterpart funding. \n12 The government of the Republic of Korea already approved on 22 January 2020 the $500,000 funding. \n ", "5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  ADB will administer the TA. It will supervise and communicate with consultants and \nstakeholders. The NHA, as the executing agency, will implement the TA and be accountable for \nthe outputs.  \n \n19.
