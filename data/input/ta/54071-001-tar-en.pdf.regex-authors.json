INTRODUCTION \n  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will help Pacific developing member \ncountries (DMCs) implement safeguards by (i) developing a region-wide strategy and plan for \nsustainable environment and involuntary resettlement safeguards capacity strengthening, and \n(ii) providing targeted training and sector and/or project-specific consulting services in the 14 \nPacific DMCs.1 It will take into consideration the recommendations of the Independent Evaluation \nDepartment\u2019s performance evaluation report Strengthening Safeguard Capacity in the Pacific.2 \nThe TA is in the Pacific Regional Operations Business Plan, 2020\u20132022 and management-\napproved work program of the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Pacific Department (PARD).3  \nII.  ISSUES \n  There are significant challenges in the Pacific, not least the number of fragile and conflict-\naffected situations and small island developing states, as well as the frequency of disasters and \nthe increasing fragility caused by climate change. Limited and often expensive air and marine \ntransportation presents additional challenges. Each of the drivers described below compound the \ncomplexity of implementing safeguards in the region. \n  Constrained administrative and technical capacity, and limited country safeguard \nsystems. Environmental and social government agencies typically are understaffed. Existing staff \n(and local consultants) have limited familiarity with international standards and practices and \nsometimes lack authority and/or resources. For the environment, all but one Pacific DMC (Nauru) \nhas in place environmental impact assessment and/or environmental protection legislation.4 \nFor land matters and resettlement, land laws in some Pacific DMCs focus more on acquisition \nand alienation of land and less on protection of landowners or their assets.5 \n  Diversity of indigenous and social structures, and complex land tenure. The Pacific \nDMCs have varying histories of colonization and conflict, along with differing local traditions and \ncustoms, which have left legacies that affect and shape institutional and regulatory arrangements \nfor land and marine tenure. All Pacific DMCs, except for Tonga, legally recognize customary land \nownership, although land rights are managed according to unique processes linked to each \nsociety\u2019s social and traditional belief systems.6  \n  Varying forms of customary tenure, coupled with land scarcity and parallel use of both \nformal and customary systems, frequently complicate the process of obtaining access to land for \ndevelopment projects.  \n \n1  The Safeguard Policy Statement 2009 (SPS) is currently under review and revision. A future TA will address \napplication of indigenous peoples safeguard in the Pacific following the new guidance. The 14 Pacific DMCs are the \nCook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, \nSamoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. \n2  Independent Evaluation Department. 2019. Performance Evaluation Report: Strengthening Safeguard Capacity in \nthe Pacific. Manila: ADB. \n3  ADB. 2019. Pacific: Regional Operations Business Plan, 2020\u20132022. Manila. The TA first appeared in the business \nopportunities section of the website of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on 26 August 2020.  \n4  Nauru does have Wild Birds Preservation Act, 1937, which legislates for the protection of wild birds, but it does not \nyet have environmental impact assessment legislation.  A draft environmental management bill has been presented \nto Cabinet in 2019 for consideration. \n5   An evaluation of the country safeguards system (CSS) for equivalence with the 70 key principles of the environment \nsafeguard requirement in the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) indicates that Pacific DMCs range from 2%\u201346% \nfor full equivalence with the key principles, 7%\u201349% for partial equivalence, and 17%\u201387% for no equivalence (Table \n1 in Country Safeguards Systems: Strengthening Needs, accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n3).  It also presents key gaps with the involuntary resettlement safeguard. \n6  Tonga practices a feudal system, with land belonging to the King and land granted to chiefs. \n ", " 2 \n  Customary matters and indigenous structures are typically addressed within land law \nframeworks and within the application of involuntary resettlement safeguards. In terms of the \ninvoluntary  resettlement  safeguard  requirement.  All  Pacific  DMCs,  except  Nauru,  permit \nexpropriation by the government for public purpose development projects, but to date only the \ngovernments of Papua New Guinea and Samoa are known to regularly exercise expropriation \nlaws. Most expropriation laws were enacted during colonial times to provide for eminent domain, \ncompulsory  acquisition,  and  alienation  of custom  land  and,  post-colonialism,  are  often  not \nexercised because of a range of reasons. The use of negotiated settlements for development \nprojects is common in Pacific DMCs. Such arrangements can enhance human rights and security \nof land tenure for customary landowners but necessitate complex due diligence requirements to \navoid and reduce social risks. \n  Safeguard implementation issues and challenges. Weak capacity of government \nagencies,  inadequate  legal  frameworks,  lack  of  coordination,  and  weak  enforcement  of \nregulations where they do exist are the key constraints on safeguard implementation in Pacific \nDMCs. There are gaps in country safeguards systems (CSS), compounded by shortages of \ncomprehensive guidance products and implementing regulations, despite past positive efforts in \nthis area. An evaluation of the CSS for equivalence with the 70 key principles of the environment \nsafeguard requirement in the Safeguard Policy Statement 2009 (SPS) indicates that 59% of \nPacific DMC domestic laws and regulations overall were fully or partially equivalent with the \nenvironment policies. The equivalence assessment results for involuntary resettlement policies \nshowed that domestic laws and regulations had no equivalence with more than two-thirds of the \nSPS policy principles and key elements.7 The differing demands of development partners relating \nto safeguards further complicates implementation in Pacific DMCs.  \n  Symptoms  of  these  key  constraints.  In  the  Pacific,  the  CSS  focus  on \ndevelopment/project  approval  and  less  on  implementation.  Assessments  conducted  at  the \nfeasibility study stage are often not updated, and in turn bidding documents are released and \nconstruction activities commence with weak environmental management plans, affected persons \nare not fully compensated, and at times national approvals are not obtained. Contractors lack \ncapacity and/or experience in environmental management, and health and safety matters are not \nuniformly addressed, leading to increased risks on projects.  \n  Need to continue working with partners. Pacific DMCs\u2019 challenges and constraints \nrequire continued collaboration between development partners through mechanisms such as the \nPacific Learning Partnership for Environmental and Social Sustainability (PLP-ESS), which was \nestablished by ADB, World Bank, University of the South Pacific, and the Secretariat of the Pacific \nRegional Environment Programme (SPREP) in April 2019 to foster training, knowledge exchange, \nand coordinated capacity development activities. ADB\u2019s PARD also is an active member of the \nPacific Regional Infrastructure Facility (PRIF) Safeguards Working Group to help Pacific DMCs \nimplement more efficiently their respective environment and social requirements. The PRIF \nSafeguards Working Group has also made significant progress in developing a framework for \ndevelopment partners to use that seeks to promote common terminology and approaches to \nsafeguards, in a publication titled The Shared Approach. The SPREP plays an important role by \nhelping the Pacific DMCs strengthen and implement their CSS; however, SPREP has focused on \nthe implementation of environmental impact assessment legislation and has not yet moved into \nsocial impact aspects (as they relate to EIA) or post-approval environmental management \nrequirements. In the Pacific region, there is no equivalent to SPREP for social safeguards.  \n \n7 Country Safeguards Systems: Strengthening Needs (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "3 \n  The PLP-ESS is looking to help develop social safeguard training and provide resources \nto SPREP to deliver social safeguards-focused training, in addition to SPREP\u2019s comprehensive \nprogram of environmental safeguards training. Also, the PLP-ESS has helped the University of \nthe South Pacific develop a post-graduate diploma program. The Postgraduate Diploma in Islands \nand Oceans Stewardship will be one way to effectively support the needs of the region in further \ndeveloping capacity for environmental and social safeguards and further embed and expand \nenvironmental and social management learning opportunities already offered by the university to \nboth existing and future practitioners.   \n  Lessons learned.8 The lessons learned from projects and implementing capacity building \nactivities during the previous TA, as well as the findings from an independent evaluation of \nPARD\u2019s TA projects, provide direction for future safeguards capacity development.9 Key lessons \nlearned include the need to: (i) consider alternatives to standard approaches for safeguards \nimplementation and capacity development (including technologies and different outsourcing \nmodalities);  (ii)  repeat  capacity  development  efforts  over  time  to  address  understaffing, \nunderfunding, and high staff turnover in regulatory agencies; (iii) address limited knowledge of \ngovernment  staff  of  their  own  CSS  requirements  and  complex  issues  of  safeguards \nimplementation; and (iv) address findings on access to land including (a) the limited role of \nnegotiated settlements, especially in situations where customary ownership prevails, (b) the \nmisunderstandings that may occur during implementation based on differing understandings of \ncustomary roles and responsibilities, and (c) balancing land access for development projects with \nthe need to support customary land ownership tenure and associated traditions, beliefs, and \npractices.  The  recommendations  from  the  Independent  Evaluation  Department\u2019s  Pacific \nsafeguards TA performance evaluation (footnote 9) included: (i) developing a long-term vision \nand  strategy  for  capacity  strengthening  in  the  Pacific,  (ii)  addressing  gaps  in  regulatory \nframeworks, (iii) furthering current partnerships, and (iv) conducting follow-up assessments on \nland issues.  \n  This TA initiates a multiyear process to deliver on lessons learned and recommendations. \nPhase 1 will implement short-term actions. The strategy and lessons learned during phase 1 will \nidentify medium- and longer-term needs and actions, which will drive a planned phase 2 TA. \n  Sustainable approach. A TA output will be a strategy for capacity development, which \nwill provide a road map that all development partners can use as basis for capacity development \nefforts. This will support sustainable outcomes because all development partners can contribute \nto the overall effort in a coordinated manner. The TA will update training needs assessments \ncompleted in previous TA. In addition, the PLP-ESS has recently been working on a training needs \nassessments plan to ensure coordinated efforts from the partners\u2014the strategy to be developed \nunder the TA will incorporate this plan, consulting closely with PLP-ESS members should \nadjustments be needed. A sustained, long-term effort in capacity development with inputs from \nmultiple partners will be required in the region to ensure that learnings and achievements are \nembedded and retained. The more coordinated the approach among partners, the more likely the \nefforts will be sustainable. \n \n8  Further detail is provided in Delivering on Lessons Learned (accessible from list of linked documents - Appendix 3). \n9  PARD\u2019s projects include TA projects for 8217-SOL, 8737-SOL, 9073-VAN, 8428-KIR; and four subprojects delivered \nunder TA 7566-REG (2 in Timor-Leste, 1 in Papua New Guinea and 1 in Vanuatu).

Impact and Outcome \n  The TA is aligned with the following impact: safeguards implementation in Pacific DMCs \nis improved.10 The TA will have the following outcome: a coordinated and sustainable approach \nto safeguards strengthening is developed and implemented.11  \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n  Output  1:  Region-wide  safeguards  capacity  development  strategy  and  plan \nprepared, and short-term capacity development activities implemented. The TA team and \nconsultants will identify gaps in safeguards capacity and implementation across Pacific DMCs \nand develop a regional strategy and plan, with short-, medium-, and long-term actions for each \nPacific DMC through which development partner support can be coordinated.12 The consultants \nand firm will implement short-term actions identified in the strategy and plan, such as targeted \nworkshops and training and development of guidelines and/or manuals to support institutional \nstrengthening in safeguards application.13  \n  The plan will include actions that aim to deliver sustainable impacts by: (i) targeting \npositive changes in safeguards implementation that will be continued in the long-term (such as \ntraining combined with development of manuals), and (ii) supporting Pacific-led capacity building \nactivities and working towards the goal that these activities will be able to continue independent \nof development partner support in the future (such as train-the-trainer courses for new staff within \nregulatory agencies). The strategy will support and complement the efforts and plans of existing \npartnerships and working groups. For instance, the strategy will build upon PLP-ESS efforts to \nestablish new postgraduate and diploma courses in safeguards at University of the South Pacific \n(with existing funding by the World Bank). The strategy will also be informed by, and seek to \nenhance, activities being implemented and planned by SPREP. Towards the end of the TA, the \nstrategy will be updated based on lessons learned from delivery of the selected short-term actions \nand as required, in line with proposed changes to the ADB safeguards policies. \n  Output 2: Targeted safeguards support delivered. A pool of national and international \nenvironment and social safeguard consultants with relevant and suitable experience will be \nengaged under the TA to provide project and/or sector specific responses on demand to issues \nas they arise. Where possible, implementing agencies will be requested to nominate a safeguards \nfocal or counterpart(s) to foster transfer of knowledge and experience in practical settings. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund ($600,000 under TASF 6, and $150,000 under TASF-other \nsources). The key expenditure items are in Appendix 2. \n \n10 ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila; ADB. 2016. Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020. Manila; and ADB. 2009. Safeguard Policy Statement. Manila. \n11 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n12  The strategy will be updated following any changes to ADB\u2019s safeguards policies that occur during the TA \nimplementation period. \n13  Short-term training will be consistent with the objectives of PLP-ESS (a capacity development collaboration signed \nby ADB, World Bank, SPREP, and the University of the South Pacific in April 2019). The strategy will also (i) identify \nwhat legal reforms are required to strengthen the regulatory framework of CSS, and (ii) achieve the buy-in necessary \nfor implementable reforms to be undertaken in subsequent TA phases.  \n ", "5 \n  Governments will provide counterpart support in the form of government staff as focal \npoints  for  the  TA  and  participants  in  training  and  capacity  development  delivery,  office \naccommodation, and other in-kind contributions.  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n  ADB will administer the TA through PARD\u2019s Portfolio, Results, and Quality Control Unit, \nwhich will also provide information and updates to ADB\u2019s Sustainable Development and Climate \nChange Department and relevant sector and thematic groups. The TA will be delivered through \na  phased  approach.  The  first  phase  ($750,000)  will  be  delivered  from  November  2020 to \nDecember 2022. PARD will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants; organize workshops; and \nprovide  staff  to  act  as  resource  persons  in  some  of  the  workshops  or  training  activities. \nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in the table. \n  The planned second phase TA will implement medium-term actions identified in the \nstrategy.14 The second  phase  (and  possibly  additional  subsequent  phases)  with  separate \nfinancing will be implemented from August 2023 to at least December 2025 (and possibly longer).   \nImplementation Arrangements for Phase 1 \nAspect  Arrangements \nImplementation period  November 2020\u2013December 2022 \nExecuting and \nPacific Department of the Asian Development Bank  \nimplementing agency \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \n  Contract modality  Consultant  Costa \nIndividual: Individual   Safeguards and Institutional Specialists  $105,500 \nConsultant Selection  (international, 6 person-month) \nIndividual: Framework  Environment Specialist   $140,000 \nAgreement  (international, 8 person-month) \nIndividual: Framework  Resettlement Specialist   $140,000 \nAgreement  (international, 8 person-month) \nFirm: Quality- and cost- Training/capacity building delivery,  $165,000 \nbased selection  institutional strengthening  \nProcurement  Not applicable     \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from time to time). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, TA = technical assistance. a Fees and/or remuneration only, excludes per diem, travel \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n  Consulting services.
