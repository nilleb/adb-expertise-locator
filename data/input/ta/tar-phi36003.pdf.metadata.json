The Government of the Philippines has requested technical assistance (TA) from the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  support  the  implementation  of  an  effective  anti-money \nlaundering regime.1  A fact-finding mission fielded in February 2002 held discussions with \nofficials  from  the  Anti-Money  Laundering  Council  (AMLC),2 Central  Bank,  Securities  and \nExchange  Commission,  Insurance  Commission,  Department  of  Justice,  and  industry \nassociations. The mission reached an understanding with the Government on the objective, \nscope, cost estimates, and implementation arrangements for the TA.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The need for an effective anti-money laundering regime is crucial and pressing for at \nleast two sets of reasons: \n \n(i)  Money laundering activities have their origins in graft, corruption, and other forms \nof criminal activity.4  These activities undermine the Government\u2019s legitimacy as \nwell  as  investor  confidence.  The  development  of  an  effective  anti-money \nlaundering  regime  is  fundamental  to  strengthening  market  governance  and \ninvestor confidence. It is likewise fundamental to supporting a broad range of \nreforms in the context of ADB\u2019s core policies on governance and anticorruption, \nand the 2002-2004 Country Strategy and Program Update specifically promotes \ngood governance through \u201cimproving transparency\u2026and tackling corruption.\u201d \n \n(ii)  The Philippines has been included in the Financial Action Task Force on Money \nLaundering\u2019s (FATF)5 list of noncooperative countries and territories (NCCTs), \nand  it  needs  to  substantially  comply  with  FATF  recommendations  to  avoid \ncountermeasures. The countermeasures would significantly impede the ability of \nfinancial  institutions  located  in  the  Philippines  and  of  Philippine  financial \ninstitutions located abroad to conduct international transactions. Imposition of \ncountermeasures would have a disastrous impact on the country\u2019s economic \nrecovery. \n \n3.  As  a  fundamental  first  step  towards  the  establishment  of  an  effective  anti-money \nlaundering regime, an anti-money laundering law (Republic Act 9160) was enacted on 29 \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet Edition) in January 2002. \n2  AMLC was established under the newly enacted anti-money laundering law (Republic Act 9160) and is the lead \nmonitoring and investigative agency in this area (i.e. the financial intelligence unit).  Its chair is the Central Bank \nGovernor and its secretariat is drawn from the staffs of the Central Bank, Securities and Exchange Commission, \nand Insurance Commission. \n3 The TA will draw and build upon the country-specific legal and institutional analysis provided by TA 5967-REG: \nCountering Money Laundering in the Asian and Pacific Region, for $650,000, approved on 20 December 2000.  A \nsimilar TA to provide country-specific implementation support to Indonesia is also currently under processing (TA-\n35498-INO: Development of an Anti-Money Laundering Regime, for $1,500,000, financed from the Asian Currency \nCrisis Support Facility, expected approval in March 2002). \n4  By nature, money laundering activities are difficult to observe and measure, but the Government estimates that \nthey amount to billions of pesos a year, with drug trafficking, graft, and corruption constituting the largest sources of \nlaundered money. \n5  FATF is the principal international body concerned with money laundering issues. It has issued a set of 40 \nrecommendations that establish a basic framework for anti-money-laundering efforts and now constitute a standard \nin the field.  In 1999-2000, FATF began the process of identifying jurisdictions with serious deficiencies in their anti-\nmoney laundering regime.  The Philippines was placed on the list of noncooperative countries and territories in \nJune 2000 as a result of this exercise. ", "  2   \nSeptember 2001.  A subsequent assessment of the law by FATF, however, identified several \nserious deficiencies, notably \n \n(i)  the threshold for triggering suspicious transaction reports is too high to constitute \na meaningful deterrent to money laundering; 6 \n \n(ii)  the scope of predicate crimes covered by the law is too narrow; and \n \n(iii)  provisions in the law hinder rather than strengthen the Government\u2019s power to \ncarry out effective investigations. \n \nFATF thus decided to keep the Philippines on its NCCT list. \n \n4.  The  Government  has  argued  that  most  of  the  noted  deficiencies  can  be  remedied \nthrough  implementing  rules  and  regulations  (IRRs)  and  is  currently  in  the  process  of \npromulgating these.  Should the IRRs prove unable to adequately address FATF concerns, the \nGovernment has indicated that it will take necessary steps to amend the law.  In either case, the \nGovernment has signaled its commitment to establishing an effective anti-money laundering \nregime.  \n \n5.  Establishment of an adequate legal framework is, however, only the first step in the \ndevelopment of an effective anti-money laundering regime.  An institutional structure will have to \nbe created and institutional capacity built to effectively implement the law.  Development of an \nanti-money laundering institutional structure in the Philippines has involved the creation of \nAMLC as the lead agency in this area, but it will also involve the designation of special anti-\nmoney laundering courts and the formulation and formalization of the various interinstitutional \nrelationships needed to make an anti-money laundering regime function.  These changes are \nnot seen as particularly problematic, but they will take time to implement. \n \n6.  The development of adequate institutional capacity to implement the law, on the other \nhand, is an area that will require significant resources including technical support.  Specialized \ncapacity will have to be built across a wide range of institutions in order to implement the law \neffectively.  Support will need to be particularly intensive in the case of AMLC, where prior \noperational experience does not exist domestically.7 \n \n7.  Finally, as previously indicated, implementation of an effective anti-money laundering \nregime  will  take  time,  as  an  institutional  structure  needs  to  be  established  and  adequate \ncapacity needs to be developed.  A successful outcome will require the sustained involvement \nand  support  of  a  wide  range  of  government  agencies,  industry  associations,  and  other \nconstituencies. \n \n                                                 \n6 The threshold is set at approximately $80,000. \n7 This will include the design and implementation of specialized training programs for AMLC staff, as well as a study \ntour (organized in close consultation with the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering) to familiarize key officials \nwith the practical aspects of financial intelligence unit operations through visits to jurisdictions where such units are \ncurrently functioning. ", "  3   \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The TA will support the implementation of an effective anti-money-laundering regime in \nthe Philippines. In particular, it will (i) draft a time-bound plan for the implementation of an \neffective anti-money laundering regime, and (ii) provide support to facilitate execution of that \nplan.  The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n9.  The major outputs expected from the TA are \n \n(i)  time-bound  plan  with  milestones  for  the  implementation  of  an  effective  anti-\nmoney laundering regime;  the establishment of a time-bound plan is one of the \nnecessary steps outlined by FATF for removal from its NCCT list; \n \n(ii)  blueprint  detailing  the  design  and  requirements  for  a  suspicious  transaction \nmonitoring system;  an effective monitoring system is crucial for the operation of \nAMLC, and the blueprint will enable the Government to take the necessary steps \nto establish such a system; \n \n(iii)  provision of specialized training across a wide range of key institutions;8  this will \nbe the main output (measured in terms of consultant inputs) of the TA and is \nessential in order to develop adequate capacity to implement an effective anti-\nmoney-laundering regime; and \n \n(iv)  background study undertaken and disseminated;  implementation of an effective \nanti-money laundering regime will require the sustained involvement and support \nof  a  wide  range  of  government  agencies,  industry  associations,  and  other \nconstituencies;  to strengthen and maintain such support, a background study will \nbe  undertaken  that  clearly  and  concretely  identifies  the  costs  to  key \nconstituencies of not establishing an effective anti-money laundering regime.9 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.   The  time-bound  plan  will  be  instrumental  for  coordinating,  documenting,  and \nmaintaining the momentum of efforts towards the establishment of an effective anti-money \nlaundering regime.  It will need to be both sufficiently realistic (to adequately reflect existing \nconstraints)  as  well  as  sufficiently  rigorous  (to  show  meaningful  progress  towards  the \nestablishment of an effective anti-money laundering regime).  To help achieve this balance, it \nwill be developed in close consultation with individual implementing agencies as well as with the \nAsia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG).10  Consultation with APG on the plan will also \nhelp facilitate the development of a regional approach to anti-money laundering issues.  \n \n11.  An effective system for monitoring suspicious transactions is crucial for the operation of \nAMLC.  To enable the Government to begin taking steps to acquire and establish such a system \n                                                 \n8 Key institutions include the executing and implementing agencies under this TA (para. 16) as well as financial-\nsector industry associations (whose members have responsibility for reporting functions under the anti-money \nlaundering regime). \n9 The study is different in content and purpose from the country-specific legal and institutional analysis undertaken by \nTA 5967-REG. \n10 APG is a regional body that is similar in purpose to FATF and shares a close working relationship with it. ", "  4   \nas early as possible, the blueprint and requirements for the system will be developed by a small \nteam of international and domestic consultants ahead of the rest of the TA. \n \n12.  Orientation and specialized training programs for the staff of key institutions will be \ndesigned  based  on  detailed  needs  assessments.    Training  will  be  conducted,  where \nappropriate, by consultants engaged under this TA, but additional resource persons may also \nbe brought in, as necessary, to conduct targeted workshops on special areas.  The training \nprograms will be designed and implemented in close consultation, wherever possible, with \nexisting training institutions. \n \n13.  The background study is intended to strengthen and maintain support for implementation \nof an effective anti-money laundering regime.  To be effective, it should (i) clearly and concretely \ncommunicate  the  costs  to  key  constituencies  of  not  implementing  an  effective  anti-money \nlaundering  regime,  (ii)  convincingly  address  concerns  expressed  during  congressional \ndeliberations  on  the  anti-money  laundering  law,  and  (iii)  be  effectively  communicated  to \nstrategic audiences. \n \n14.  Implementation  of  an  effective  anti-money  laundering  regime  will  require  resources \nsignificantly in excess of what will be available under this TA.  It is anticipated, however, that \nadditional support will be forthcoming from other agencies.11  This TA will facilitate the effective \ncoordination  and  timely  mobilization  of  government  and  external  resources  through \nestablishment of two key tools: (i) the time-bound plan, which will provide a common reference \nfor what needs to be done and when, and (ii) regular Government-aid agency meetings, which \nwill  provide  a  forum  for  tracking  who  is  doing  what,  updating  progress  on  the  plan,  and \naddressing needs and constraints as they arise.12  Key aid agencies have been consulted on \nthe formulation of this TA, and these mechanisms will help ensure that that close coordination is \nmaintained during TA implementation. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.45 million equivalent, comprising $742,000 in foreign \nexchange  costs  and  $708,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs.    The  Government  has \nrequested ADB to finance $1 million equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$258,000 equivalent of local currency costs.  The TA will be provided on a grant basis from the \nAsian Currency Crisis Support Facility, financed by the Government of Japan.  The Government \nwill provide facilities and counterpart support valued at $450,000 equivalent.  The cost estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  AMLC  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA.    It  will  establish  an  interagency \ncoordination committee chaired by its executive director and including representatives from \neach of the implementing agencies.  Implementing agencies will include the Central Bank, \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, Insurance Commission, Department of Justice (including \nthe National Bureau of Investigation and the Solicitor General\u2019s Office), and the judiciary. The \ncommittee will meet, as needed, to coordinate and facilitate effective implementation of the TA.  \n                                                 \n11  The United States Agency for International Development has already provided support for the drafting of the anti-\nmoney-laundering law and IRRs and plans to provide additional support for their implementation. \n12  It is proposed that the meetings include all interested aid agencies rather than just those currently active in this \narea.  This is intended to allow the Government to maximize the potential for support in this area as well as to \neffectively and efficiently communicate the progress it is achieving to a key audience. ", "  5   \nThe TA will be implemented over 18 months and is expected to commence in May 2002 and be \ncompleted by October 2003.13  To avoid overlap and maximize synergies, TA implementation \nwill be closely coordinated with key aid agencies involved in this area using the mechanisms \noutlined in paragraph 14. \n \n17.  It is estimated that the TA will require a total of 44 person-months of consulting services, \nconsisting of 19 person-months of international and 25 person-months of domestic consulting \nservices.  There will be three separate contracts for consulting services.  The first two will be for \nindividual consultants who will work together to develop the blueprint and requirements for a \nsuspicious transaction monitoring system for AMLC.  This component of the TA will require 2 \nperson-months  each  of  international  and  domestic  consulting  services.  The  international \nconsultant will be a financial intelligence unit/information technology expert, and the domestic \nconsultant will be a financial sector expert.  The remaining 17 person-months of international \nand  23  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  will  be  contracted  to  a  firm.  \nRequirements for international consulting services under this contract include (i) an anti-money \nlaundering expert, (ii) a financial sector expert, (iii) a forensic accounting/financial intelligence \nunit expert, and (iv) a law enforcement expert.  Requirements for domestic consulting services \ninclude (i) an institutional change expert, (ii) a banking expert, (iii) a securities expert, (iv) an \ninsurance expert, (v) a law enforcement expert, (vi) a judicial expert, and (vii) an economist.  \nThe consultant team under the firm contract will be responsible for identifying and recruiting \n(with ADB concurrence) additional resource persons, as needed, for the implementation of \nspecialized training programs under the TA.  The team leader will also be responsible for \norganizing  and  overseeing  a  study  tour  designed  to  familiarize  key  officials  with  practical \naspects of financial intelligence unit operations.  All consultants will be recruited in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB \nfor the engagement of domestic consultants.  Consultants will be engaged using the simplified \ntechnical proposal method.  The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. \n  \n18.  The consultants engaged under the firm contract will prepare four reports: inception, \ninterim,  draft  final,  and  final  report.  Tripartite  reviews  will  be  conducted  by  ADB,  the \nGovernment, and the consultants to consider the reports. The consultants will conduct two \nseminars for stakeholders to discuss the TA. The first seminar will be conducted on inception of \nthe TA and will present the TA concept and solicit feedback on its design.  The second will \npresent and discuss the content of the draft final report.  Computers and other equipment to \nsupport the implementation of the TA will be procured by direct purchase in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance on a grant basis to the Government of the Republic of the \nPhilippines in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 for Strengthening the Anti-\nMoney Laundering Regime, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n                                                 \n13 The start date refers to the fielding of individual consultants for design of the suspicious transactions monitoring \nsystem (para. 17).
