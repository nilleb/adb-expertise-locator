INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) cluster will support the preparation \nof economic diagnostic studies to assist developing member countries (DMCs) enhance national \ndevelopment plans and strategies for achieving sustained and inclusive growth.1 The studies will \nutilize the latest tools, methodologies, and data to help identify macroeconomic, sector, and \nthematic constraints to growth and inclusion; and recommend policy actions for relaxing these \nconstraints, paying careful attention to the costs and benefits of alternative interventions. The TA \nwill also support capacity building for DMCs to undertake an economic diagnostic approach \ntoward development planning. \n \n2.  The TA cluster is included in the Management-approved 2021 Economic Research and \nRegional Cooperation Department (ERCD) work program.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES  \n \n3.  Many  countries  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  have  made  significant  strides  in  achieving \nsustained economic growth and poverty reduction in the last 5 decades. However, a lot still needs \nto be done to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially when these \nachievements are tested by external shocks such as the ongoing coronavirus disease pandemic \nor the 2007\u20132008 global financial crisis, which led to large contractions in most economies. \nBeyond the immediate human and economic impacts of the coronavirus disease crisis, the \npandemic has also exacerbated the development challenges that countries in the region had \nalready  faced  and  has  further  highlighted  the  importance  of  well-functioning  markets  and \nevidence-based  policy  interventions  to  recover  from  shocks.  The  crisis  also  provides  an \nopportunity for economic policy to correct market failures and regulatory distortions that may \notherwise have been difficult to unwind.3 Thus the need to carry out diagnostic studies has \nbecome even more important, as the studies can assist DMC governments in addressing the \nmost pressing challenges faced by their economies for achieving inclusive and sustainable \ngrowth.   \n \n4.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) introduced diagnostic studies in 2007 under the \nStrengthening Country Diagnosis and Analysis of Binding Development Constraints in Selected \nDeveloping Member Countries TA project, with the objective of improving DMCs\u2019 capacity to plan, \nimplement, and account for the outcomes of the policies, program, and projects they implement.4 \nUnder this 2007 TA project and succeeding TA projects, ADB was able to collaborate with DMC \n \n1  The term \u201ceconomic\u201d is used to distinguish other diagnostic-related studies published by the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) on different issues such as disaster risk management and long-term care. Economic diagnostic studies \nare aimed at understanding the most binding constraints to achieving broad-based economic growth through in-\ndepth assessments of macroeconomic, sector, and thematic issues, the removal of which could yield the highest \nwelfare gains for individual DMCs. \n2  The concept paper for the TA cluster was approved on 10 May 2021 and first appeared in the business opportunities \nsection of ADB\u2019s website on 13 May 2021. \n3  The crisis has highlighted the importance of reforms in a diverse range of sectors, including social, infrastructure, \npublic sector management, etc. For example, the pandemic has led to a renewed focus on environmental resilience \nand sustainability as well as the inclusiveness of growth, the importance of financial considerations and market \nmotives in driving private investment in green and social finance, and the role that governments will have to play in \nshaping markets. ADB. 2021. Asian Development Outlook 2021: Financing a Green and Inclusive Recovery. Manila.  \n4  ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance for Strengthening Country Diagnostic and Analysis of Binding Development \nConstraints in Selected Developing Member Countries. Manila (TA 6397-REG).  \n \n ", "2 \ngovernments and various development partners in conducting country diagnostic studies.5 These \nstudies utilized diagnostic approaches and quantitative methodologies to identify constraints to \ninclusive and sustainable growth at the macroeconomic, sector, and thematic levels. \n \n5.  Whereas some upper middle-income countries in the region may have the expertise, most \nDMCs lack the analytical and planning capacity to undertake high-quality diagnostic analysis. The \nconduct of diagnostic studies will help low- and middle-income DMCs identify the most pressing \nchallenges in the medium and long term and focus their limited resources toward addressing the \nmost critical constraints at the macroeconomic, sector, and thematic levels. Under Strategy 2030, \nADB is enhancing its role as a knowledge provider by developing knowledge that is tailored to \nlocal contexts and helping replicate lessons and good practices across the region to help achieve \nthe Sustainable Development Goal.6 The diagnostic studies will undertake analyses in priority \nareas that can deliver useful inputs to prepare national development plans; sector and thematic \ndevelopment strategies; and ADB interventions, including country partnership strategy (CPS) \ndocuments. With the overarching objective of identifying constraints to high growth that is \ninclusive and sustainable, the diagnostic studies will directly or indirectly be aligned with all the \noperational priorities (OP) of Strategy 2030. \n  \n6.  To ensure that these diagnostic studies cater to the needs of the DMCs, the studies will \nfollow Strategy 2030 principles on adopting a country-focused approach. Individual studies will \nuse a differentiated approach since DMCs face different challenges given their various stages of \ndevelopment.7  The diagnostic studies will also help identify and quantify, where possible, the \npotential costs and benefits of tailored recommended policy and other related actions. The \ndiagnostic studies will be aligned with the objectives of the Knowledge Management Action Plan, \n2021\u20132025,8 which  aims  to  improve  country  knowledge  programming  efforts  and  better \nunderstand DMCs\u2019 knowledge needs. \n   \n7.  While the frameworks utilized for the conduct of earlier diagnostic studies remain relevant, \nthe availability of newer methodologies and the use of big data can help improve the reliability of \nstudy findings.9  Likewise, DMCs prefer real-time and flexible support through studies that can be \ncompleted quickly. This can be accomplished by shifting the focus of the studies from the \npublication of one large, edited volume covering a range of topics to shorter and more focused \nreports. Finally, a greater focus on sector and thematic issues can allow for more in-depth analysis \nand, if undertaken for several countries, can also enable comparative analyses across countries \nto highlight lessons and best practices. \n \n \n5  ADB. 2020. Technical Assistance for Diagnosing Critical Constraints to Growth and Structural Transformation in \nSelected Developing Member Countries. Manila (TA 7686-REG); and ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance for Country \nDiagnostic Studies in Selected Developing Member Countries. Manila (C-TA 0011-REG). \n6  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n7  Adopting a differentiated approach is particularly important to small island developing states, i.e., 16 ADB DMCs in \nthe Pacific, where data availability and data processing capacity constraints are prevalent. Further, other ongoing \nERCD TA projects, especially those focused on statistics capacity building and big data methods, can be tapped to \nhelp conduct the studies and improve evidence-based policy making. \n8  ADB. 2021. Knowledge Management Action Plan 2021\u20132025: Knowledge for a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and \nSustainable Asia and Pacific. Manila. \n9  In particular, the emergence of big data can also aid development planning of DMCs. This is the case for the ongoing \nstudy on urbanization and growth in India, being funded by Technical Assistance for Country Diagnostic Studies in \nSelected Developing Member Countries (Subproject 4). Manila (TA 9508-REG).   \n ", "3 \nIII.  JUSTIFICATION FOR CLUSTER MODALITY \n \n8.  The TA cluster and its subprojects are strategically linked to one common overall objective \nand adopting a cluster modality enables ADB to cater to the demand for diagnostic studies in a \nmore systematic way and over a longer period without tying down TA resource requirements \nentirely at the onset. Moreover, experience with the first TA cluster on the conduct of diagnostic \nstudies suggests that adopting a cluster modality allows the TA to be more responsive to the \nneeds and timing of DMCs\u2019 planning cycles and ADB\u2019s CPSs given the flexibility in the design \nand its implementation arrangements. Finally, processing the TA as a cluster reduces the \nresources that would otherwise be associated with processing individual subprojects as stand-\nalone TA interventions. \n \nIV.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLUSTER \n \nA.  Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n9.  The TA cluster is aligned with the following impact: critical constraints to ADB\u2019s DMCs\u2019 \ninclusive and sustainable economic growth addressed. The TA cluster will have the following \noutcome: diagnostic approaches and methodologies in the development planning processes of \nDMCs adopted and/or improved.10  \n      \n10.  The TA cluster will comprise three subprojects, each of which will provide technical and \nanalytical as well as capacity building support to DMCs to enable the identification of policy actions \nand investments that can help address development constraints. The three subprojects under the \nTA cluster will comprise two main outputs: (i) diagnostic studies conducted and/or published, and \n(ii)  the  capacity  of  developing  member  country  officials  to  employ  diagnostic  approaches, \nmethodologies and tools to conduct economic and policy analysis developed and enhanced. The \ndesign of subsequent subprojects will benefit from lessons learned from the implementation of \nsubproject 1. \n \n11.  Output 1: Diagnostic studies conducted and/or published. This will support the \nconduct of 6\u20138 studies per subproject across three different categories of diagnostics. The study \ncategories are described as follows: \n (i)       Diagnostic study on the growth and inclusion performance of developing member \ncountries. Two types of studies are envisaged. The first is a narrative style diagnostic \nreport of about 30 pages that will provide a broad overview of the economic performance \nof a selected DMC including the policy drivers of the growth and inclusion experience, and \nthe types of interventions that are most promising for promoting high, sustained, and \ninclusive. The study will rely mainly on existing literature and readily available descriptive \nstatistics.11 The second, which is more technical in nature, will rely more on original \nquantitative analysis and delve deeper into selected aspects of the growth process. The \nfirst  type  will  feed  directly  into  the  inclusive  sustainable  growth  assessment  linked \ndocument of the DMC\u2019s CPS, while the second type will be carried out upon request by \nthe CPS team, with its specific contents decided based on findings of the first study and/or \ndiscussions with ADB resident missions and regional departments in line with the recent \n \n10 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n11 For example, possible analyses may include (i) sectoral decompositions of growth and employment and a scenario \nanalysis for the evolution of growth and employment over the next 10\u201320 years, (ii) assessment of potential growth \nand the balance-of-payments constraint, and (iii) product space analysis and/or global value chain analysis and \nprospects for diversification. \n ", "4 \nCountry  Partnership  Strategy  and  Results  Framework  Review,  which  calls  for  CPS \npreparation to explore a strategic engagement with ERCD (and the ADB Institute).12 \n(ii)      Diagnostic study on the country\u2019s critical constraints. The report will be like earlier \ncountry diagnostic studies undertaken, as it will identify constraints to growth and inclusion \nbased on an assessment of macroeconomic, sector, and thematic issues. Such studies, \nwhich take at least a year to produce, will be undertaken in case of strong demand by a \nDMC or regional department. \n (iii)    Diagnostic study on a sector or thematic area. These reports will be single or multi-\ncountry studies, with the latter allowing comparative policy analysis. These studies are not \nlimited by theme or sector, but priority will be given to those aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2030 priorities.13 New and emerging topics such as technological and digital change will \nalso be considered in a forward-looking manner. The topics will be determined by ADB\u2019s \nEconomic Analysis and Operational Support Division (EREA) considering inputs and \nsuggestions from sector and thematic groups and regional departments. \n \n12.  The publications will be widely disseminated in collaboration with ADB\u2019s Department of \nCommunications  and  participating  regional  department  or  resident  missions.  In-country  or \nregional launches will be organized to disseminate the studies. Dissemination events will include \npresentations of study findings and analytical discussions of the study recommendations in \npartnership with academic institutions, think tanks, and/or development partners. The studies will \nbe disseminated mainly as electronic files on the ADB website.14  \n \n13.   Output  2:  The  capacity  of  developing  member  country  officials  to  employ \ndiagnostic approaches, methodologies and tools to conduct economic and policy analysis \ndeveloped and enhanced. The output will include training workshops to help create awareness \nand improve the capacity of DMC officials and think tanks involved in the preparation of national, \nregional, sector, and thematic development plans and policies.15 It will also produce knowledge \nproducts on the application of the analytical tools that can be used to undertake policy analysis, \nincluding relevant regional perspectives. Adopting a demonstration approach can help build the \ncapacity of DMC planning agencies in integrating economic diagnostic methodologies in their own \nplanning activities, including with regard to their participation in subregional programs.16 \n \nB.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA cluster is estimated to cost $5,000,000, of which (i) $2,500,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 7) and (ii) $2,500,000 will \nbe financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). \nThe  three  subprojects  under  the  cluster  will  have  the  following  allocation:  subproject  1: \n$2,000,000, subproject 2: $1,500,000, and subproject 3: $1,500,000 (Appendix 2). Detailed cost \n \n12 ADB. 2021. Country Partnership Strategy and Results Framework Review. Manila. \n13 Topics under sector and thematic studies can include: economics of climate change, incorporating climate resilience \nand enhancing environmental sustainability in policy formation; making cities more livable; strengthening governance \nand institutional capacity to support development planning and regional cooperation and integration as a driver of \ngrowth. \n14 Printed copies will be limited and will be on demand basis in compliance with the administrative order on energy, \nenvironment, health, and safety management system.

Manila. \n15 Training workshops and/or seminars on diagnostic approaches will be conducted for each DMC, as needed.  \n16 The TA cluster will explore and include as part of its implementation various approaches to assess the capacity \nbuilding efforts under each of the subprojects. \n ", "5 \nestimates  and  financing  arrangements  will  be  presented  in  each  TA  subproject  proposal \nsubmitted for approval. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will administer the TA cluster. EREA will directly handle TA cluster administration \nand supervision, management of consultants, procurement, and accomplishment of outputs. \nAdopting the One ADB approach in knowledge solutions, EREA will collaborate with regional \ndepartments (including resident missions), other knowledge departments, and relevant sector and \nthematic groups for the activities under each subproject. Each TA subproject proposal will be \nsubmitted for approval to the ERCD chief economist and director general, following the business \nprocess for knowledge and support TA cluster processing.17 Subproject activities will start only \n  \nafter approval of each TA subproject proposal. Implementation arrangements are summarized in \nTable 1.18 \n \n16.  EREA will adopt multiple approaches in the identification of studies under output 1, \nincluding the following: \n(i)  EREA will issue a call for proposals to regional departments and respective resident \nmissions, and sector and thematic groups. The proposed topics will be selected or \nprioritized based on ERCD\u2019s capacity and expertise, sector or thematic priorities, and \nrelevant country knowledge plans. \n(ii)  EREA will tap the Regional Economic Outlook Task Force, which comprises ERCD \nand regional department staff responsible for analysis of DMC economic prospects, to \nhelp identify issues especially relevant to medium-term prospects for economic growth \nand diversification and/or the growth assessments associated with CPS preparation. \n(iii)  EREA will discuss with the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department \nand regional departments to provide support for selected studies in the country \nknowledge plans of DMCs that match with subproject sector or thematic priorities. \n(iv)  EREA will accommodate direct requests from DMCs for any follow-up or new study \nfollowing similar diagnostic studies already conducted. \n(v)  EREA will partner with international financial and research institutions, including the \nADB Institute, on topics that are of common interest and relevant to ADB DMCs. \n \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements for the Technical Assistance Cluster \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation  August 2021\u2013July 2030 \nperiod for the TA cluster \nExecuting agency  ADB \nImplementing agencies  Economic Analysis and Operational Support Division, Economic \nResearch and Regional Cooperation Department \nConsultantsa  Package title  Selection method  Engaged by  \nFirms: CQS and/or direct  International (76  ADB \ncontracting (single-source  person-months) and \nselection)  national (66 person-\nmonths) \n \n17 ADB. 2019.

Subprojects. The TA cluster will be implemented through three subprojects (Appendix 2). \nEach subproject will be designed to support the achievement of the cluster outputs (paras. 11\u2013\n13) as and when needed during the implementation period. The indicative implementation period \nand the budget allocation for the subprojects are summarized in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Indicative Implementation Period and Budget Allocation for Subprojects \nBudget \nItem  Subproject Title  Implementation Period  ($\u2019000) \nSubproject 1  Economic Diagnostic Studies in Asia and  August 2021\u2013July 2024  2,000 \n the Pacific \nSubproject 2  Economic Diagnostic Studies in Asia and  August 2024\u2013July 2027   1,500 \n the Pacific \nSubproject 3  Economic Diagnostic Studies in Asia and  August 2027\u2013July 2030  1,500 \nthe Pacific \n  Source: Asian Development Bank. \n \n18.  Consulting services. The TA cluster will require the services of a mix of individual \nconsultants and firms. Requisite fields of expertise and person-months of consulting services in \nthe Terms of Reference for Consultants linked document are indicative, and will be finalized upon \nfurther assessment of the resource needs and availability of qualified consultants.19 Firms may \nbe recruited especially if study requires (i) unique expertise; (ii) a team of experts that need to \ncollaborate to prepare the study; and (iii) need to access proprietary data platforms and/or conduct \nof sophisticated modelling techniques. The firm/s will be selected through consultant qualification \nselection or direct contracting method. Individual consultants will also be recruited to prepare \nbackground papers, diagnostic analyses, and chapter/s of the study report/s on topic/s or areas \nidentified.  Aside  from  economists,  sector  specialists,  econometrics  specialists  or modelers, \nindividual experts to provide economic advisory and economic editing and communications and \npublications related expertise will be engaged. National consultants and research assistants will \nlikewise be engaged to provide technical support for data gathering and analysis. National \nconsultants will also be needed for the desktop publishing and graphic design of the publication. \nResource persons will be engaged to provide advice on study scope, undertake review and \nprovide comments on the draft reports. Contracts for consulting services will consist of output-\nbased (lump-sum), time-based or framework contracts, as appropriate, and the consultants and \nresource persons will be recruited based on requisite experience and qualifications. Inasmuch as \nthe subprojects will cover a wide range of topics, highly qualified consultants with relevant \nexpertise will most likely be associated with specialized firms, research institutions, think tanks, \n \n19 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of supplementary documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "7 \nand universities. Further, the TA will require rapid mobilization of the publication specialist to \nfacilitate the publication process. All consultants will be engaged in accordance with the ADB \nProcurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the associated staff instructions.  \n \n19.  Knowledge  partnerships.  EREA  will  seek  to  collaborate  with  reputable  centers  of \nexcellence, and these may be engaged through knowledge partnership agreements (KPAs). \nSpecific entities will be identified during TA cluster implementation. A nomination proposal will be \nprepared for proposed knowledge partners, and the corresponding KPA will be finalized prior to \napproval of each TA subproject. Where knowledge partners are identified after TA subproject \napproval, EREA will prepare a minor change in implementation arrangements following the Staff \nInstruction on Business Processes for Knowledge Partnerships under Technical Assistance \nOperations.20 \n \n20.  ADB\u2019s procurement. The TA studies require both macro and micro data. The data sets \nwill be procured from government agencies, private data providers, and research institutes. \nEquipment  (e.g.,  laptop  computers,  handheld  devices,  sensors,  and  other  infrastructure \nmonitoring equipment) and software may also be procured for the TA where needed.21 Where \napplicable, the TA project team will coordinate with ADB\u2019s Procurement, Portfolio, and Financial \nManagement Department and its Office of the General Counsel before purchasing data sets and \nsigning data use agreements with DMC statistical agencies and third-party database providers. \nThe TA team will also consult ADB\u2019s Information Technology Department and its Corporate \nServices  Department  in  relation  to  the  purchase  of  information  communication  technology \nhardware and software. Procurement will follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time) and the associated staff instructions. Upon TA completion, any procured \nequipment  will  be  disposed  of  in  compliance  with  Administering  Grant-Financed  Technical \nAssistance Projects in the Project Administration Instructions.22  \n \n21.  Social media and websites. Knowledge product dissemination will be conducted through \nthe uploading of TA outputs onto ADB websites and social media, such as Twitter and blogs. This \nwill  be  coordinated  closely  with  the  Department  of  Communications  and  the  Information \nTechnology Department. \n \nV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $5,000,000 on a grant basis for \nEconomic Diagnostic Studies in Asia and the Pacific, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n20 ADB. 2017.

The first category is a report on the growth and \ninclusion performance of DMCs, where two types of studies are \nenvisaged. Under the first, the TA will support preparation of a \nshort narrative diagnostic that can provide a broad overview of \nthe economic performance of a selected DMC, discussing its \nexperience in achieving inclusive growth objective and the policy \ndrivers that may have contributed to this. The second under this \ncategory is a more technical report that will use quantitative \nanalysis to delve deeper into selected aspects of the growth \nprocess. \n \nThe second category of study is a diagnostic report on the \ncountry\u2019s critical constraints, which will be similar to earlier \ncountry diagnostic studies undertaken wherein the study will \nidentify constraints to growth and inclusion based on an \nassessment of macroeconomic, sector, and thematic issues.  \n \nThe third category of study is a diagnostic report on a sector or \nthematic area that can cover single or multi-country studies, with \nthe latter allowing comparative policy analysis. This study \ncategory will give priority to themes and/or sectors aligned with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.a New and emerging topics such as \ntechnological and digital change will also be considered in a \nforward-looking manner. \n \nOutput 2 will support development and enhancement of DMC \nofficials\u2019 capacity in employing diagnostic approaches and tools \nto conduct economic and policy analysis. The output will include \ntraining workshops to help create awareness and improve the \ncapacity of DMC officials and think tanks involved in the \npreparation of national, sector, and thematic development plans \nand policies. It will also produce knowledge products on the \napplication of the analytical tools that can be used to undertake \npolicy analysis.  \nIndicative implementation  ADB will administer subproject 1.
