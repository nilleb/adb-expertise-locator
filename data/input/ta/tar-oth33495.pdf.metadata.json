INTRODUCTION\n1. The 1995 Strategy for the Pacific1 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) identifies\nsupport for private sector development as one of the priority development areas. Following\ndiscussions with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), ADB approved regional technical\nassistance (TA)2 to support South Pacific Project Facility (SPPF) activities in ADB's Pacific\ndeveloping member countries (PDMCs) in line with ADB's objectives to facilitate private sector\ndevelopment in PDMCs. TA 5683-REG was completed in 1998. The TA was rated generally\nsuccessful, as the main objectives have been substantially met, and the work undertaken by the\nSPPF resulted in sizable private sector investments in PDMCs.  IFC has asked ADB to continue\ncofunding SPPF activities. Discussions have been held with IFC and SPPF on this matter during\n1999. These discussions included attendance by an ADB mission at the SPPF Annual Donors\nMeeting in Nadi, Fiji on 22-24 November 1999. This regional TA is the outcome of these\ndiscussions.3\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The Strategy for the Pacific noted that relatively high investment levels and large aid\nflows to PDMCs have not generated sustainable growth. Public sector investments have been\nineffective to a large extent, while private sector investments remained low. Given ADB's overall\nobjective  for  the  region  of  improving  living  standards  through  sustainable  economic\ndevelopment,  the focus of ADB's  work  is  on  improving productivity  and  on private  sector\ndevelopment.\n3. Furthermore, ADB has been providing extensive support to public sector reforms in\nPDMCs. Implementation of these reforms has led to reduced public sector employment. The\nexpectation has been that the private sector would make up for this reduction. However, in\nsome PDMCs, this has not happened; thus, proactive support is needed to catalyze private\nsector development in PDMCs.\n4. In  the  earlier  years,  ADB provided  support  to private  sector development  activities\nthrough  state-owned  development  finance  institutions.  However,  the  success  rate  of  such\nprojects has been somewhat limited and, by the beginning of 1990s, ADB virtually stopped\nlending to development finance institutions. In recent years, ADB's support to private sector\ndevelopment  in  PDMCs  has  been  mainly  through  promoting  establishment  of  a  policy\nenvironment conducive to private sector development. ADB has sought other opportunities to\nprovide direct assistance to private sector development in PDMCs. Given the generally small\nsize (by the Bank standards) of potential projects, ADB has made only one private sector\ninvestment on a PDMC.4 Kula Fund provides equity and debt financing for the larger projects (in\nthe PDMC context) from $500,000. However, the development needs of smaller companies\ncharacteristic to PDMCs remain to be addressed.\n5. ADB wishes to expand its role in private sector development activities, to effectively\ncompliment its extensive involvement in public sector reforms. ADB has been supporting and\nextending its coverage of relevant regional institutions in this area, taking into account high\ncosts of delivering services to PDMCs and allowing for effective coordination of activities among\n                                               \n1 Asian Development Bank. 1996.

Thus the TA will seek to stimulate private sector investment and development\nusing the existing network, organizational, and managerial capabilities of SPPF.\n6. SPPF was established in 1990 by the International  Finance  Corporation  (IFC)  with\nadditional funding from Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and IFC. SPPF\u2019s mission is to\nassist and accelerate the development of productive, self-sustaining, small and medium-sized,\nprivate sector entrepreneurs in Pacific island countries. The principal activities of SPPF cover\nthe following areas: (i) evaluating business ideas and concepts on an objective and confidential\nbasis;  (ii)  developing  business  plans,  and,  where  appropriate,  engaging  expert  technical\nadvisers to carry out feasibility and market studies to fully evaluate the viability of business\nproposals; (iii) arranging and negotiating debt and equity finance on the best available terms;\n(iv)  identifying  technical  and  managerial  requirements  of  clients  and,  if  required,  sourcing\ntechnical partners, on equitable and fair terms; (v) assisting in the selection of business partners\nand investors; (vi) advising on the purchase of local companies from foreign shareholders or\nacquiring state-owned enterprises that member countries wish to privatize; and (vii) advising\nPacific  island  governments  on  private  sector  initiatives  and  privatization  of  public  sector\nenterprises.\n7. SPPF has a five-member advisory board, comprising representatives from developed\nand developing countries in the Pacific with extensive experience in business and economic\ndevelopment (Appendix 1). IFC provides technical and management support to SPPF. SPPF\noperates from a Sydney office with an IFC regional manager, together with six professional staff\nand three support staff. Consultants are employed to undertake specific project assignments. In\naddition, SPPF has local agents in most of the PDMCs, which allows it to maintain contact with\nlocal business and entrepreneurs. SPPF has provided most of its services free or at nominal\ncharge, with contributions by donors meeting virtually the full cost of SPPF operations. The\ninitial eight years of operations to 31 December 1998 were funded by a budget contributed by\nIFC and donors.\n8. During its eight years of operation, SPPF has completed 93 projects spread throughout\n10 Pacific island countries. The cumulative project value, for which financing has been arranged\nis about $84 million. Almost $61 million of financing was arranged for these projects, which are\nbroadly distributed by country and by sector (Appendix 2).\n9. Among these activities, ADB's  TA 5683-REG financed  over 70  separate  consulting\nassignments in nine PDMCs. Assignments in Papua New Guinea (19), Fiji (20), and Samoa (14)\naccounted for 75 percent of overall TA funding. While assignments in Federated States of\nMicronesia (5), Cook Islands (3), Solomon Islands (2), Tonga (3), Vanuatu (3), and Kiribati (1)\naccounted for the remaining 25 percent. Of these, the TA funded feasibility studies for 32\nprojects, which resulted in private sector investment of approximately $25 million.\n10. TA  5683-REG  was  generally  successful  (para.  1).  Feedback  from  private  sector\nrepresentatives during various missions in several PDMCs confirmed the high relevance of\nSPPF\u2019s  operations,  and  recent  external  review  concluded  that  SPPF  was  operating\nsatisfactorily.5  The  report  noted  that  \"in  most  dimensions,  SPPF  have  met  or  exceeded\nexpectations.\"\n11. In its initial eight years of operation, SPPF has established itself as a reputable regional\norganization.  It  enjoys  good  support  among  PDMCs,  and  its  activities  have  contributed\n                                               \n5 SPPF: Review of Effectiveness and Efficiency, Yeoman Ward International Limited, February 1998.", "substantially to private sector development. As a result of this support, Fiji, Kiribati, and Samoa\nhave also committed funding to SPPF. While SPPF\u2019s operating budget is being met by the\nexisting donors, funding for consultants is insufficient to meet the needs. SPPF is currently\nnearing the end of its second five-year budget cycle. IFC proposes to go to its board with a\nproposal for the third phase from January 2001 to December 2005, and is planning to seek\ndonor support for the third phase on a similar basis as that for the earlier phases.\n12. Given the comparative advantage enjoyed by SPPF, and the satisfactory record of TA\n5683-REG, ADB's assistance in financing SPPF's consulting budget can be an effective tool in\nstimulating private sector investment in PDMCs. Using the TA funds, ADB can capitalize on\nSPPF's established and demonstrated capabilities in developing viable private sector projects,\nwhich could then be referred for possible financing by ADB's Private Sector Group.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objective\n13. In accordance with ADB's overall objective in the Pacific region of improving  living\nstandards through sustainable economic development, the TA will stimulate productive private\nsector investment and business activities by enhancing the provision of business and technical\nadvice to private sector entrepreneurs and businesses.\nB.  Scope\n14. The TA will help meet the cost of consultants recruited by SPPF in undertaking its\nproject-related activities for private sector entrepreneurs and business in PDMCs. In accordance\nwith the pattern established by past SPPF operations, the consulting requirement is primarily for\nshort-term assignments involving both desk and field work. In line with this need, the TA is\nexpected to fund the costs of approximately 30 assignments totaling approximately 15 person-\nmonths (the TA Framework is in Appendix 3).\n15. SPPF services financed by the TA will be limited to ADB's PDMCs. With the exception of\nCook Islands, Nauru, Palau, and Tuvalu, ADB and IFC have common membership among\nPacific  developing  countries.  While  SPPF  services  are  directed  principally  to  IFC  Pacific\nmembers, they have also been extended to other countries. Accordingly, SPPF will include all\nADB PDMCs in the countries to which it will provide services.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n16. The TA is expected to be used over a period of 36 months, ending on 31 December\n2002. Over this period, SPPF total expenditures on consultants is projected at about $840,000,6\nof which $300,000 will be financed by the TA (Appendix 2). The TA will fund fees, airfares, and\ndaily  substinence  payments  relating to  short-term  consulting  assignments.  The  TA  will  be\nfinanced by ADB on a grant basis from ADB-funded TA program.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n17. SPPF will be the Executing Agency for the TA. In view of the large number of short-term\nassignments to be funded by the TA, it is proposed that SPPF undertake all matters relating to\n                                               \n6  Calculated on the basis of consulting expenses budget projection supplied by SPPF.", "the design of specific assignments, preparation of terms of reference, selection and recruitment\nof consultants, and administration of each assignment.\n18. SPPF  operates  according  to  IFC  consultant  selection  procedures,  and  consultant\ncontracts are in the name of IFC. Accordingly, IFC consultant selection procedures consistent\nwith ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants will be used for the selection of consultants\nfinanced  under  the  TA.  In  addition,  IFC  guidelines  for  payment  of  consultant  fees  and\nallowances will apply. However, specific procedures will be adopted to ensure that TA funds will\nbe applied only to meet costs relating to consultants recruited from ADB's member countries\nand will be formalized in an agreement between IFC and ADB on agreed procedures.\n19. The use of TA funds is further defined by the eligibility criteria and operation procedures\nset out in Appendix 4, including the requirement that only consulting assignments relating to\nprojects in ADB's PDMCs will be eligible for ADB financing.7 Eligibility criteria for the use of the\nfunds, initially elaborated in TA 5683-REG, have been amended to include the requirement to\nrefer potential viable projects developed using TA funds for possible financing by the Private\nSector Group. SPPF does not require advance or simultaneous payment from ADB at the time it\nmakes payment for consultant services. Accordingly, SPPF will seek reimbursement from ADB\non the basis of claims to be submitted quarterly for eligible expenditures under the TA. ADB will,\nhowever, retain the right of prior approval through the Office of Pacific Operations (i) to ensure\nadequate coordination of ADB and SPPF inputs with respect  to any assignment  involving\nprivatization of state-owned enterprises; and (ii) to be aware of any assignment expected to cost\nmore than $25,000 equivalent.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n20. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of\n$300,000 for the South Pacific Project Facility II: Private Sector Development Support, and\nhereby reports such action to the Board.\n                                               \n7 Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, Kiribati, Republic of Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Papua\nNew Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.
