INTRODUCTION \n1.  During  the  2009  country  programming  mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provide technical \nassistance (TA) for Capacity Development for Rural Pension Administration and Services. A \nfact-finding mission for this TA visited Beijing from 15 to 19 March 2010, during which an \nunderstanding  was  reached  on  the  objectives,  scope,  terms  of  reference,  cost  estimates, \nfinancing  plan,  and  implementation  arrangements  of  this  TA.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  A lack of social security coverage for the elderly in rural areas exacerbates rural\u2013urban \neconomic disparity and concern about social instability in the PRC. According to the National \nBureau of Statistics of China, over 55% of the country's population are rural residents, and \nalmost two-thirds of the workforce is employed in rural areas. However, only about 10% of this \nrural workforce is covered by current rural pension schemes.  \n \n3.   The  government  has  attempted  to  strengthen  old-age  protection  in  rural  areas  by \nintroducing a rural pension system. The Ministry of Civil Affairs (MOCA) was in charge of \nimplementation, promulgating a basic program for rural social security insurance at the county \nlevel in 1992. This program was established in more than 57% of townships, almost all counties, \na little less than 75% of prefectures, and slightly more than 87% of provinces by the end of 1997. \nHowever, the government decided to abolish it in 1999, declaring that there were insufficient \nconditions in rural areas to carry out an extensive pension scheme.2 In the same year, authority \nfor the rural pension system was also transferred from MOCA to the Ministry of Labor and \nSocial Security, which has been reorganized into the Ministry of Human Resources and Social \nSecurity (MOHRSS). \n \n4.  Since then, several pilot rural pension schemes were implemented by local governments, \nwhich differed among areas according to their financial capacities and policy purposes. In \ngeneral, these pilot systems were not very successful. Two major challenges were identified as \nobstacles to the establishment of effective rural pension systems in the PRC: (i) imperfect \ndesigns of rural pension systems,3 and (ii) lack of organizational capacity to conduct pension \nadministration and services. \n \n5.  Then, in 2009, toward achieving its goal of a harmonious society, the central government \nagain decided to improve old-age income security in rural areas. The State Council promulgated \nGuiding Principles on the Development of the New Rural Pension Pilot, and launched pilot \nprojects in 10% of the counties in the PRC.4  \n \n6.  For the successful implementation of the pilot projects and eventually the establishment \nof  an  effective  rural  pension  system,  ADB  launched  TA  for  Rural  Pension  Reform  and \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the ADB website on 5 May 2010. \n2  According to the government, major risks involved in the implementation of this scheme were (i) financial risks from \ntoo-generous benefits, (ii) operational risks from weak administrative capacity, (iii) misleading information given to \nfarmers, and (iv) social instability caused by the mismanagement of local governments. \n3  The most frequently mentioned problems are (i) insufficient pension benefits to protect post-retirement life, (ii) lack \nof portability of pension entitlement among different regions, and (iii) lack of government subsidies for pensioners. \n4  ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to the People's Republic of China for Rural Pension Reform and Development. \nManila (TA 7317-PRC, for $500,000, approved 24 July) provides the design details of the pilot scheme.  \n ", "2   \nDevelopment in 2009 (footnote 4). Through this TA, ADB is assisting the PRC in developing an \neffective institutional design for its rural pension system.5 However, for it to be successful, \nstrengthening  institutional  capacity  for  implementing  pension  services  is  critical.  This  is \nespecially the case for the PRC, since both the number of rural residents and the area that must \nbe covered by the rural pension system are large. \n \n7.  Related  to  strengthening  the  institutional  capacity,  some  of  the  most  urgent  issues \nrequiring policy makers' attention can be drawn from the implementation of the TA for Rural \nPension Reform and Development and a review of past reform efforts. \n(i)  The issue lies in the underdeveloped capacity and insufficient number of public \nservants who handle rural pension services. Since the authority responsible for \nrural pension administration in local governments has not been well established,6 \nstaff members have not had the opportunity to develop the necessary capacity. \nIn addition, in 2008, 2,860 county agencies had an average of five staff members \neach, while 41,040 agencies in townships had an average of one or two. \n(ii)  Operational standards are lacking, leading to increased management inefficiency \nas well as higher operational and investment risks. For example, there are no \nspecific  standards  for  what  kind  of  information  needs  to  be  collected  from \npension participants, when and how to collect it, how to transfer data and funds \nto different rural areas, and what information needs to be checked at pension \ndelivery.  \n(iii)  Systems for performance measurement and internal control are also absent. It is \nimportant to develop such systems not only because they help strengthen public \nconfidence in the rural pension system, but also because they can develop staff \ncapacity through monitoring and quality control. \n \n8.  Therefore,  for  the  successful  establishment  of  a  rural  pension  system  in  the  PRC, \ncapacity development for rural pension agencies needs to be addressed, including a better \nfinancing strategy and appropriate human resources allocation. In addition, strategies need to \nbe established for the integration of the segmented pension administration system by designing \nproper  operational  standards  and  setting  up  effective  mechanisms  for  performance \nmeasurement and internal control. This is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, \n2008\u20132010 to support social safety nets and a pension system in response to the demographic \nshift in the PRC.7 Furthermore, the TA will address inclusive growth and balanced development, \nas the better administration of the rural pension system will improve income security for elderly \nrural residents the majority of whom have been excluded from the pension coverage and help \nthem share the benefits of national economic growth. \n \n                                                 \n5  The TA aims to provide (i) an analysis of the sustainability of the rural pension system using a projection of its \nrevenue and expenditure; (ii) an overview of the policy, legal, regulatory, and administrative frameworks of the rural \npension system; and (iii) lessons in the areas of policy reform and formulation of operational procedures and \ntechnical parameters. \n6  Since  the  1998  institutional  reform  (para.  3),  rural  pension  administration  in  local  governments  has  been \ntransferred from the Civil Affairs Department, which corresponds to the Ministry of Civil Affairs in the central \ngovernment, to the Department of Human Resources and Social Security which corresponds to the Ministry of \nHuman Resources and Social Security in the central government. However, since the consolidation process has \nnot yet been completed, some counties have pension systems still under the Civil Affairs Department. \n7  ADB. 2008. Country Partnership Strategy: People's Republic of China, 2008\u20132010. Manila. \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the TA will be the establishment of a well-functioning rural pension system \nthat provides basic income protection for the elderly rural population. The achievement of this \nimpact will be demonstrated through the population's increased participation in the rural pension \nsystem. The TA's outcome will be the establishment of an efficient rural pension administration \nsystem with an appropriate level of resources, well-developed standards of practice, and well-\ndesigned  systems  for  performance  measurement  and  internal  control.  Success  will  be \nmeasured by increased staff and budget for rural pension agencies; consistent operational \nprocedure adopted by rural pension agencies; and improved quality of service delivery including \nshorter processing time and reduced incidents of mismanagement. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  Key activities of the TA will be comprised of two major parts. The first part will consist of \nthe formulation of proposals on how to integrate rural pension administration agencies and on \nhow to design a rural pension management and delivery system, including the setting up of \nagencies at township and village levels. The second part will consist of the identification of \nmanagerial issues that must be addressed, range of services that the system will deliver, \ndetailed operational flows, and internal control measures.  \n \n11.  The TA will involve extensive field surveys on the existing rural pension pilot projects to \ngather data on the current status of the rural pension system regarding its management, service \ndelivery, and operational flows. The data from these surveys will be used as inputs into the \nprocess of designing a better rural pension system for the PRC. Targeted workshops and \nseminars  will  then  be  conducted  for  different  stakeholders  at  various  stages  of  TA \nimplementation. In the initial stage, workshops will be held with the executing agency to discuss \nthe feasibility and viability of the TA implementation plan. After field studies of typical areas have \nbeen  completed,  workshops  will  be  organized  to  discuss  lessons  learned  and  to  identify \ndirections for next steps. Seminars will also be held for government officials and specialists in \nrelevant fields to gather their inputs on draft reports. \n \n12.  The TA outputs will be one overview report, two thematic reports, one draft policy \ndocument on standards of practice, and a series of policy notes as knowledge products. \n(i)  Report\u2014Developing capacity for the management and service delivery of \nrural pensions in the People's Republic of China. The components of this \nreport will include an overview of the historical development, current situation, \nand problems of the rural pension system; a discussion on strategies for its \norganizational structure, human resources allocation, and operational procedures; \na  discussion  on  designing  internal  control  mechanisms;  and  an  analysis  on \napplying different management and service delivery models in rural areas in \ndifferent  stages  of  economic  development.  The  report  will  also  provide \nrecommendations for policy, legal and regulatory, and administrative reforms in \nthe rural pension system in the PRC. \n(ii)  Thematic report I\u2014Capacity building for rural pension agencies. This report \nwill present the analyses and proposals for developing capacity in rural pension \nagencies. It will propose institutional designs, including sizes of organizations \nand allocation of human resources, and relevant policies for supporting their \noperation. It will consider the economic development stage of each area when \n ", "4   \nproposing policy recommendations and providing suitable solutions, as needed, \nfor their lack of human resources and funding. \n(iii)  Thematic report II\u2014Operational steps and business flows of rural pension \nadministration  in  the  People's  Republic  of  China.  This  report  will  be \ncomposed of four parts. The first part will identify the major activities at each \noperational stage of the rural pension system and propose standards on how to \nexecute those activities. The second part will develop concrete performance \nindicators  for  each  operational  stage  and  design  workflows  following  those \nindicators.  The  third  part  will  develop  protocols  for  the  efficient  transfer  of \npensioner rights among different rural areas. The fourth part will propose the \nmechanisms for checking fund flows among individual accounts, government \nsubsidies,  and  collective  subsidies  as  well  as  for  enhancing  the  security  of \naccounts. \n(iv)  Standards of practice on operational steps and business flows of rural \npension administration in the People's Republic of China. This document will \nbe the basis of the policy document. It will be drafted based on all of the above \nresearch outcomes. It will serve as specific guidelines for MOHRSS and rural \ngovernments to implement and monitor rural pension systems. \n(v)  A series of policy notes geared toward higher level policy and decision \nmakers. Based on the results from workshops and seminars sponsored by the \nTA, a series of policy notes on relevant issues such as setting up rural pension \nagencies and designing operational procedures will be produced.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $700,000 equivalent. The government has requested ADB \nto finance $500,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013Others). The government will provide in-kind contribution of \n$200,000, through the provision of miscellaneous expenses such as office accommodation, \ntransport, and office supplies. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The proposed executing agency is MOHRSS. An interdepartmental working group will \nbe  set  up  within  MOHRSS,  comprising  the  Information  Center,  International  Cooperation \nDepartment, Rural Pension Department, and Social Insurance Administration. Other ministries \nand agencies to be regularly consulted during the project implementation include the Ministry of \nFinance and the National Development and Reform Commission. The MOHRSS will provide the \nnecessary office space, counterpart staff, transport, and other services to the consultants and \nwill arrange appointments for the consultants with relevant agencies and organizations.  \n \n15.  The TA will engage one international consultant and four national consultants for a total \nof 30 person-months. The national rural pension administration and services specialist will be \nthe  team  leader.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  consultants  are  in  Appendix  3.  The \ninternational and national consultants will be selected and engaged on an individual basis in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime).  The  proceeds  of  the  TA  will  be  disbursed  in  line  with  the  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). For training seminars and \nconferences, an advance payment facility may be used. \n \n ", "  5\n16.  The TA is expected to begin in November 2010 and end in October 2011. The TA will be \nimplemented  in  four  phases.  The  first  phase  will  involve  implementation  planning  and \ndetermination of pilot locations in the central and western regions, and will be completed in 3 \nmonths. The second phase will involve the conduct of field studies, surveys, and workshops for \nreviewing the preliminary findings, to be completed in another 3 months. The third phase will be \npreparation of draft final reports, which will take another 3 months. The fourth and final phase, \nduring which the final workshop will be conducted and the TA outputs will be completed, will \ntake up the final 3-month period. \n \n17.  In  addition  to  the  main  outputs,  the  consultants  will  submit  to  both  ADB  and  the \nMOHRSS  (i)  inception  reports  2  weeks  after  commencement  of  their  services,  (ii)  interim \nprogress reports at appropriate stages during TA implementation, (iii) draft final reports before \nthe conclusion of the contract, and (iv) final reports 2 weeks after receiving comments from the \nMOHRSS and ADB. All reports must be submitted in English and Mandarin. Workshops will be \norganized  periodically  for  dissemination  of  consultant  findings  and  discussion  of  policy \nrecommendations. \n \n18.  Major project activities will be regularly monitored and reported on by the MOHRSS and \nADB missions. Consultant reports will be presented at workshops and seminars organized for \nthe validation of findings. Reports will be made available on the ADB website in English and \nMandarin, if appropriate, and published whenever appropriate. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.
