The road system of India can be grouped into four segments, viz., key national highway \nlinks under the jurisdiction of the National Highway Authority of India, other national highway \nlinks under the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, state highways and roads under the \nstate  public  works  departments  (PWDs),  and  rural  roads  under  the  Ministry  of  Rural \nDevelopment. India is undertaking a major upgrading program for the sector that will take 10 \nyears at a total cost of $13 billion. The Government of India (GOI) has requested the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to provide a series of loans to cover part of this program. Given the \npotential scale of the lending, ADB has developed a programmatic approach whereby projects \nare be developed in a sequential and progressive manner while fulfilling ADB\u2019s long-term policy \nobjectives of fostering an enabling environment for the efficient and sustainable development of \nthe road system so as to meet the needs of the public for increased mobility and efficient cargo \nmovement. Specific interventions in the road sector will differ, since each of the four segments \nfaces a different challenge.  \n \n2.  For the state highways and roads segment, the medium- to long-term objectives of \nADB\u2019s  operations  are  to  strengthen  financing  capability  through  a  variety  of  mechanisms \nincluding state-level road funds and adopting a public-private partnership approach as well as \nreengineering the current institutional arrangements for road development and maintenance. \nThe first state-level ADB intervention in the road sector was the Madhya Pradesh State Road \nSector Development Program, which is being  processed this year. The Chhattisgarh State \nRoads Sector Development1 will be the second intervention, and technical assistance (TA) is \nrequired to help design both the infrastructure investment component and a policy reform and \ninstitutional strengthening component. A Fact-Finding Mission visited Chhattisgarh on 3-7 June \n2002 and reached an understanding with the Government of Chhattisgarh (GOC) as well as \nwith  the  GOI  on  the  goals,  purpose,  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing \narrangements, and terms of reference for the TA. The TA is included in the 2002 TA program for \nIndia.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The State of Chhattisgarh was created following the bifurcation of the erstwhile Madhya \nPradesh State effective 1 November 2000. The new state is rich in natural resources including \nbauxite, iron ore, and coal, and has a large forest cover, but is comparatively poor in terms of \nincome levels and development indexes of the population. More than 40% of the population in \nthe rural areas and about 26% in the urban areas live below the GOI-defined poverty line. The \npoor road network in the state has hampered its overall socioeconomic development and is thus \na constraint in efforts to reduce poverty levels. The road network in the state, comprising about \n35,082 kilometers (km) \u2014 including 1,827 km of national highways, 3,611 km of state highways, \n2,118 km of district roads, and 27,526 km of village roads \u2014 is inadequate, as reflected in very \nlow road density in Chhattisgarh compared with India as a whole. The total state road density \nper hundred square kilometers is 26.2%: 17.8% for metalled roads and 8.4% for unmetalled \nroads. This density is below the overall national average of 74.9% for all roads: 42.4% and \n32.5%  for  metalled  and  unmetalled  roads,  respectively.  About  31%  of  the  total  length  in \n                                                 \n1 The current Country Strategy and Program states that both these loans are sector development program loans. \nHowever it is likely that the Chhattisgarh State Roads Development loan modality will be changed to a sector loan. \nThis will be determined during loan processing.  \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 21 January 2002.  ", " 2  \nChhattisgarh is unmetalled. The inadequate nature of the road network is also seen in the lack \nof rural connectivity by all-weather roads for 40% of the villages in the state.   \n \n4.  The state government envisages the development of the road sector in two north-south \nand  four  east-west  corridors,  improvement  of  connectivity  to  industrial  areas,  as  well  as \nenhanced rural road connectivity. The Chhattisgarh Infrastructure Development Corporation \n(CIDC) was established to promote infrastructure development in the state, including road \ninfrastructure improvements using a public-private partnership modality, as it was felt that the \ndecision-making  process  in  the  Chhattisgarh  PWD  was  very  slow  and  not  conducive  to \nattracting  private  sector  participation.  There  is  also  a  need  to  consider  the  policy  and \ninstitutional environment governing the road sector. The GOC has prepared a State Road Policy \nthat emphasizes a sustainable, dedicated funding mechanism for road sector development and \nmaintenance and the need for private sector participation. These policy objectives need to be \ncomplemented by an effective institutional mechanism so that they can be effectively and \nefficiently implemented. In particular, there is a need to put into place a realistic time-bound \naction plan that can help the GOC to operationalize the policies formulated. This will include \nidentifying the constraints that can hinder implementation as well as the policy, institutional, and \norganizational changes needed for effective implementation. The major institution in the road \nsector is the Chhattisgarh PWD. \n \n5.  The PWD structure is bureaucratic and because of historical reasons input-focused, and \nshould be reoriented to be output-focused. Staffing levels at professional levels are relatively \nlow,  while  that  at  other  levels  is  quite  high  considering  that  all  works  including  routine \nmaintenance works are contracted out. The number of employees in PWD is 8,745, of whom \napproximately 10% are temporary. Management of the road program is not linked to an overall \noptimal  resource  utilization  strategy.  The  financial  and  accounting  systems  need  to  be \nmodernized. Although data collection on traffic and road conditions is carried out, the data \nmanagement and utilization system needs to be modernized and computerized. Road planning \nand programming skills in the department could be enhanced by using modern computerized \ntools. PWD has outsourced technical designing to a great extent. Construction supervision is \nunderresourced  and  process-oriented.  There  needs  to  be  put  into  place  modern  project \nmanagement systems to help ensure better control of quality, progress, and cost. CIDC is a new \norganization designed to be very lean. At present it has only three professional staff, although \nmore are being recruited. It outsources its work to the private sector. Considering the remit of \nthe organization, there is a need to strengthen CIDC while maintaining its lean organizational \nstructure and mode of operation, i.e., using private sector outsourcing extensively. \n \n6.  Overloading is also a serious problem aggravating the already poor road conditions and \ninadequate maintenance. It is estimated that over 80% of trucks are overloaded to some \ndegree. This is actually a national problem, as the trucks involved are on interstate journeys, \nand there is a need to tackle it at the national level. The enforcement authorities in the state will \nneed to be properly equipped to enhance enforcement of regulations concerning overloaded \ntrucks in concert with efforts in neighboring states. Public transport services here are provided \nmainly by the private sector, although there is also a state-owned bus company. These services \nare inadequate in the outlying districts. The maximum fares that can be charged are regulated \nby the Chhattisgarh Transport Department. At present the maximum fare is set at Rs0.30/km. \nGoods transport is felt to be adequate in the state. The Transport Department does not control \nfreight transport charges. At present roads account for 80% of total freight movement and 80% \nof passenger movement. \n ", "    3\n7.  However considerable analysis has already been carried out on the problems facing the \nstate roads sector and possible ways to overcome them. The Strategic Options Study carried \nout by the World Bank, completed in 2000, carried out a comprehensive review of infrastructure \nand institutional needs in the state roads sector of erstwhile undivided Madhya Pradesh and it is \na valuable resource on the problems facing the state roads sector in Chhattisgarh. Similarly the \nTA currently being carried out by ADB for the Madhya Pradesh state roads sector is another \nvaluable  resource  that  can  be  utilized  for  this  current  TA.  This  is  because  the  solutions \nformulated for Madhya Pradesh are very relevant to Chhattisgarh, as the problems in the former \nare reflective of the situation in the latter as well, although the problems in Chhattisgarh are not \nas acute as those for Madhya Pradesh.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n8.  There will be two main components for this TA: the project preparation component and \nan institutional strengthening and policy reform component. It will be carried out in two phases. \nThe outputs for Phase I will be (i) a master plan showing the road sector infrastructure needs for \nthe next 10 years; (ii) prioritized investment needs for new roads, upgrading/major improvement \nof existing roads; (iii) feasibility studies, engineering studies, and preparation of bid documents \nfor  100  km  of  major  upgrading  works  (henceforth  called  Phase  I  core  roads);  (iv)  initial \nenvironmental impact analysis and social impact analysis for the Phase I core roads; (v) \nresettlement plans for the Phase I core roads and resettlement framework for the overall sector \ndevelopment program; (vi) action plan for the institutional strengthening of key sector institutions \nfocusing on the Chhattisgarh PWD; (vii) a private sector development plan to identify road \nprojects in the Phase I core roads suitable to attract private sector financing or public-private \npartnerships; (viii) sector plans and an action plan to encourage the development of road \ntransport services, e.g., public transport and freight transport, including reviewing relevant \nregulations;  (ix)  sector  plans  and  an  action  plan  to  improve  road  maintenance  including \nconsideration  of  different  financing  mechanisms  and  reviewing  relevant  legislation  and \nenforcement of axle load and weight restriction regulations; and (x) sector plans and an action \nplan to improve road safety. The sector plans will set out the incremental steps necessary to \nachieve measurable progress, while the action plans will cover the implementation necessary to \nachieve the first steps of the sector plans. The action plans will thus cover the measures that \ncould be implemented during the period to be covered by any possible investment project \narising from this TA.  \n \n9.  In Phase II the outputs will be (i) feasibility studies, engineering studies, and preparation \nof bid documents for 1000 km of major upgrading works and 500 km of district and rural roads \nunder the jurisdiction of PWD (henceforth called Phase II core roads), with priority to be given to \nstate roads that complement rural roads being constructed under the Pradhan Mantri Gram \nSadak Yojna or Prime Minister\u2019s Rural Road Program; (ii) initial environmental impact analysis \nand social impact analysis for the Phase II core roads; (iii) resettlement plans for the Phase II \ncore roads using the resettlement framework developed in Phase I; and (iv) a private sector \ndevelopment plan to identify road projects in the Phase II core roads suitable to attract private \nsector financing or public-private partnerships.  \n \n \n ", " 4  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  Traffic surveys, and road condition surveys need to be carried out to obtain latest traffic \ndata and a road condition profile for the state. These need to be combined with other data on \ncurrent and potential economic activities to estimate traffic patterns and volumes over the next \n10 years so that the road infrastructure expansion, upgrading, and maintenance needs over \nthose years can be identified after considering the capacity and condition of the existing network \nto carry the estimated volumes. These have to be supplemented with some environmental and \npopulation surveys (including interview surveys) to formulate the initial environmental impact \nand social impact assessments for the five ranking projects in each of the categories of new \nprojects, upgrading projects, and maintenance projects. Economic analysis of proposed projects \nwill be necessary to prioritize them, while financial analysis will be necessary to identify projects \nfor inclusion in the private sector development plan.  \n \n11.  A detailed institutional analysis of PWD and CIDC will need to be carried out so that an \ninstitutional strengthening action plan can be formulated. The action plan will need to address \nthe future institutional setup necessary for PWD to effectively manage the road sector; the \nstaffing needs of PWD to carry out its road sector functions; institutional strengthening for the \nCIDC to play its role in road sector development; a labor rationalization plan to right-size PWD; \nrecommendations for social safety nets to alleviate the negative impacts of labor rationalization; \nchanges in PWD\u2019s business processes to increase efficiency in internal resource utilization and \nmanagement; and introduction of modern management and planning tools to enable PWD to \ncarry  out  its  road  sector  management  functions  more  effectively,  including planning and \nprogramming  of  projects  for  new  investment  and  maintenance  as  well  as  more  effective \nmethods of contracting out works and of monitoring contracts and contract management.  \n \n12.  The activities that need to be carried out are data intensive, and adequate funds have \nbeen allocated for survey purposes. The time frame for the TA also takes into account the \npossibility that data might not be available in a timely fashion. The political will to push through \nthe required reforms is a key factor, and the consultants will need to provide options how the \nreform process can be managed effectively during the implementation phase.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The cost of the TA is $1,000,000 equivalent, comprising $600,000 in foreign exchange \ncosts and $400,000 equivalent in local currency costs. The entire foreign exchange cost of \n$600,000 and $200,000 equivalent of the local currency costs will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Government of the United Kingdom. The GOC will provide $200,000 equivalent for local \ncurrency  costs  in  the  form  of  services  and  facilities  including  counterpart  staff,  office \naccommodation, transport, and administrative resources. The budget includes provision for the \ntravel costs of two government representatives to Manila for contract negotiations. Details of the \ncost estimates and financing plan are shown in Appendix 1.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  CIDC will be the Executing Agency for the TA, as it reports directly to the additional chief \nsecretary and thus has greater bureaucratic clout to promote institutional reforms. A steering \ncommittee will be established; the GOC has identified the additional chief secretary-cum-finance \nsecretary as chairperson of the steering committee, who will provide  policy guidance to the \nstudy. In addition to the chairperson, the steering committee will consist of representatives of \nthe  Public  Works,  Transport,  Forest,  and  Industries  departments  and  CIDC.  The  steering ", "    5\ncommittee will meet monthly and the inception, draft final, and final reports of the consultants \nwill need to be approved by it. The chairperson of the steering committee in turn has identified \nthe secretary of public works to chair the two technical subcommittees that will be established to \nclosely monitor the progress of the TA and report back to the steering committee. The first \ntechnical subcommittee will oversee the project preparatory component of the TA and, in \naddition  to  the  chairperson,  will  consist  of  senior  officers  of  PWD.  The  second  technical \nsubcommittee will oversee the institutional development and policy reform component of the TA \nand, in addition to the chairperson, will consist of representatives of the Information Technology, \nFinance, and General Administration departments and CIDC. The technical subcommittees will \ndiscuss the working details of the study and provide overall coordination and support to the \nstudy. These subcommittees will meet at least once a month to consider the progress of the \nstudy. The GOC will also provide support in terms of office accommodation, counterpart staff, \nand transport free of charge. \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented in two segments: Part I including about 34 person-months of \nconsulting services for preparation of the investment component, and Part II of about 6 person-\nmonths for sector analysis and institutional improvement of PWD. Consulting services under \nPart  I  will  cover  tasks  for  both  Phase  I  and  Phase  II,  including  project  feasibility  study, \npreliminary  engineering  design,  economic  analysis  of  project  components,  social  and \nenvironmental impact assessments in accordance with requirements under ADB\u2019s safeguard \npolicies, and preparation of necessary procurement documents. The consultancy tasks for Part I \nwill be implemented by an international firm in association with domestic consultants with \nexpertise in (i) transport economics and traffic engineering (ii) highway engineering, (iii) geo-\ntech and topographical survey, (iv) road structures, (v) social impact analysis and resettlement, \n(vi)  environmental  impact  assessment,  and  (vii)  contracts.  Consulting  services  of  about  3 \nperson- months of international consultants and 3 person-months of domestic consultants under \nPart II will be implemented by a consultant to be engaged separately with specialized expertise \nin road sector analysis, institutional development and strengthening, labor rationalization and \npublic-private partnership in road sector.  Outline terms of reference for the consultants are \nattached as Appendix 2. The Summary Initial Poverty and Social Analysis (IPSA) is attached as \nAppendix 3.  \n \n16.  The TA is expected to be carried out over 8 months starting in February 2003 and \nending in October 2003. Advance action for the recruitment of consultants was approved by the \nPresident on 29 August 2002. Phase I will take 4 months and Phase II another 4 months. Three \nTripartite Review Meetings will be held, one to consider the Inception Report, the second the \nPhase I draft final report and the last the Phase II draft final report. In addition there will be an \nADB review mission one month after the inception report is approved. The consultants will also \nbe required to organize two workshops to which all stakeholders will be invited. The first will \nfocus on the infrastructure projects proposed, while the second will be on the institutional \nstrengthening and policy reform component. The purpose of two workshops will be to give an \nopportunity to all stakeholders to review the findings of the TA and to give comments on them. \nThe TA budget provides for these workshops and for the dissemination of information.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 to the Government \nof India to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom for preparing \nthe Chhattisgarh State Roads Sector Development, and hereby reports this action to the Board.

Introduction \n18.  The Government of India has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \ntechnical assistance (TA) for the formulation of projects suitable for financing by ADB in the \nChhattisgarh State Roads Sector Development Program. There will be two main components \nfor this TA: the project preparation component and an institutional strengthening and policy \nreform component. The objectives of the project preparatory component are to formulate a road \ninfrastructure master plan identifying the needs for new roads, upgrading/major improvements \nneeded for existing roads, and maintenance/minor improvement requirements of existing roads \nsufficient to cater to the socioeconomic development needs of Chhattisgarh State for the next \n10 years \u2014 suitable for consideration by ADB to be included as part of an investment loan for \nthe sector; and to prepare in sufficient detail core projects that can be considered for investment \nloans, i.e., potential projects. The objectives of the institutional strengthening and policy reform \ncomponent are to improve the efficiency of road sector institutions through the implementation \nof appropriate policy initiatives so that the road infrastructure asset base is sustained, and to \nensure that the institutions involved in the road sector are able to perform their functions \nefficiently and effectively by developing a sector plan that will enable the Government of \nChhattisgarh  (GOC)  to  achieve  the  medium-  and  long-term aims of fostering an enabling \nenvironment for efficient and sustainable development of the road system and reengineering the \ncurrent institutions responsible for road development and maintenance. It is estimated that 10 \nperson-months of international and 30 person\u2013months of domestic consulting services will be \nrequired.  \n \nB.  Phase I Requirements \n \n1.  Part A  \u2013 Sector Analysis to be Done by Individual Consultants During \nPhase I  \n19.
