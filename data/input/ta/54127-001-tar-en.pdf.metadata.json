INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Regional cooperation and integration (RCI) is one of the seven strategic operational \npriorities under Strategy 2030.1 The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) aims to \npromote innovations in implementing Strategy 2030 Operational Plan for Priority 7 (RCI-OP) by \n(i) supporting sector and/or subsector diversification in RCI, (ii) fostering systematic development \nof  nonsovereign  RCI,  (iii)  exploring  opportunities  in  intersubregional  cooperation,  and  (iv) \nsupporting developing member countries (DMCs) that have lagged in RCI.2 To the extent possible, \nthe TA will integrate considerations and measures to address the risks posed by the coronavirus \ndisease (COVID-19) pandemic and help Asian Development Bank (ADB) DMCs in post-pandemic \nrecovery.  \n \n2.  The TA is included in the 2020 Management-approved results-based work plan of ADB's \nSustainable Development and Climate Change Department.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Regional macroeconomic context. Asia and the Pacific has made steady progress in \ntrade and investment and has thereby become a powerhouse of world growth. Asia\u2019s share of \nintraregional trade by value reached 57% in 2019, comparable to the level in the European \nUnion.4 However, there are emerging risks that the region must address. Because of lower \ndemand from major industrialized economies, the trade tensions between the People\u2019s Republic \nof China and the United States, the rising protectionism in the world, and, more recently, the \nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, developing Asia\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP), \nwhich grew at 5.9% in 2018 and 5.1% in 2019, is expected to contract by 0.7% in 2020, the first \ncontraction since the early 1960s.5 Affected by declining business confidence, Asia\u2019s6 trade has \nalso been adversely affected. Against this background, enhancing regional cooperation is more \nimportant than ever for Asia and the Pacific to navigate through this difficult time and restore its \ngrowth momentum. \n \n4.   ADB\u2019s regional cooperation and integration operations. Under the previous RCI \noperational plan,7 ADB overall made steady progress toward achieving the RCI-related target set \nout in Strategy 2020.8 During 2017\u22122019, ADB approved 108 RCI projects totaling $15.8 billion, \naccounting for 25% in terms of project numbers and 24% by volume of ADB\u2019s total operations. \nHowever, a deeper analysis revealed several key issues that were persistent in the structure of \nand approach to ADB\u2019s RCI operations. Firstly, ADB\u2019s RCI portfolio had focused heavily on \ntransport connectivity (about 60%), which was dominated by road projects. While the focus on \ntransport (and road) connectivity has reflected DMCs\u2019 demands based on their development stage, \nADB  needs  to  expand  trade  and  investment  interventions,  building  on  improved  transport \nconnectivity. Within transport, not enough attention had been given to maritime transport (e.g., \ngreen ports development), the mode of ports, and the need for greater collaboration with the \n \n1   Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2018.

Secondly, some DMCs (especially \nthe small island developing states [SIDSs]), some areas (such as border areas) within DMCs, and \nsome segments of the economy and society in the DMCs (such as small and medium-sized \nenterprises [SMEs], women, and poor households) have lagged in terms of access to connectivity \nand trade and investment opportunities. Thirdly, though the share of RCI operations for regional \npublic goods (RPGs) saw some increase, it was still low relative to the magnitude of the risks \nfaced by DMCs, especially as environmental and health risks spread across subregions. Fourthly, \nas SMEs accelerate their internationalization (driven both by technological opportunities and the \nneed to look for new regional demand) and the direction of value chains change, strengthening \nintersubregional cooperation based on innovative analytical work will be crucial. Finally, given the \nbroad scope and complexity of RCI operations, it is imperative that multisector and cross-thematic \napproaches be adopted. All of these require innovation in the RCI portfolio. \n \n5.  The  new  RCI-OP  therefore  calls  for  special  efforts  in  innovating  RCI  operations. \nApplication of innovations defined by the RCI-OP will require prioritized actions to (i) diversify \nsectors or subsectors (e.g., by moving from road into other modes such as ports in the transport \nsector, with due attention to environmental sustainability), (ii) explore RCI opportunities for \nnonsovereign  investment  (e.g.,  by  promoting  private  sector  investments  in  environmentally \nsustainable transport, and generating opportunities for socially inclusive business, such as SMEs \nand services value chains, from cross-border trade or infrastructure connectivity to create wider \neconomic benefits in economic corridors), and (iii) increase intersubregional cooperation and \nmultisector  and  cross-thematic  approaches  (e.g.,  by  further  strengthening  RPG-related \noperations  to  address  the  increased  risks  caused  by  climate  change  and  transboundary \ncommunicable diseases, which have impact beyond individual subregions). \n \n6.  Impacts of the pandemic on regional cooperation and integration operations. The \nongoing COVID-19 pandemic has accentuated the above-noted need to innovate RCI operations. \nIt has created a regional (and global) health crisis which needs immediate responses from \ncountries, both individually and collectively. It is also having profound and dire social and \neconomic consequences at the regional level that may remain for some time. The pandemic has \ncaused  serious shocks  through  various  channels:  it  has  disconnected  countries  by  cutting \ntransport  links,  damaged  logistics  networks  that  serve  regional  production  and  trade,  and \ndisrupted regional services value chains (particularly tourism and business travel) by halting the \nmovement of people because of border closures and travel bans. The impact will likely fall more \nheavily on poorer countries with weaker institutional capacities and on the business segments, \npeople, and geographic areas that are already vulnerable\u2014especially SMEs, women, and the \npoor households involved in services trade\u2014and communities in remote areas. \n \n7.  Therefore, over the medium term, the COVID-19 pandemic will necessitate changes (even \na paradigm shift) in how RCI is approached under each pillar of the RCI-OP. Future RCI \noperations must incorporate health resilience to the extent possible through a multisector and  \ncross-thematic approach. In transport, given the crucial role of maritime connectivity for goods \ntrade, diversification into maritime connectivity should also consider aspects of cross-border \ncommunicable disease control. In trade and investment, the development of regional value chains \n(including service value chains) likewise needs to factor in health risks and adopt the latest \ntechnologies to facilitate safer movement of goods and people across borders, and SMEs \n(particularly those engaged in the internationalization process) need special support to recover \nfrom the shocks, including through enhanced regional financial cooperation. In RPGs, supporting \nthe SIDSs, which are among the most vulnerable and challenged DMCs, should be prioritized, \nespecially given the prevalence of concurrent compound risks of climate change threat and \npandemics such as COVID-19. \n ", "3 \n \n8.  It is in this context that the TA is designed. The TA will support implementation of the RCI-\nOP by addressing selectively some of the most pressing needs of DMCs for medium-term post-\nCOVID-19 recovery in the areas of (i) developing higher-quality connectivity, focusing on greening \nand improving the resilience of maritime transport; (ii) expanding regional and global trade and \ninvestment, focusing on developing resilient regional service value chains and supporting SMEs \nthrough regional financial cooperation; and (iii) supporting SIDSs in mitigating climate change and \ntransboundary health risks. While the TA is not intended to be an immediate response to the \nCOVID-19 crisis, due consideration has been given to the need for integrating health resilience in \nRCI operations over the medium term by mitigating accentuated risks to maritime goods trade \ngrowth recovery, promoting wider socially inclusive benefits from trade and investment, and \nreducing post-pandemic impacts on environmental sustainability.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA will be aligned with the following impact: inclusive, sustainable, and resilient intra- \nand intersubregional cooperation and integration in Asia and the Pacific supported (footnote 2). \nThe TA will have the following outcome: innovative RCI operations in the areas of connectivity, \ntrade and investment, and RPGs increased in selected DMCs.9  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Best practices and investment opportunities for green and resilient port \ndevelopment identified. This output aims to support diversification of the transport subsector \nunder the RCI-OP\u2019s connectivity pillar. Ports are essential for the global economy, as most trade \nhappens by sea. The People\u2019s Republic of China and Southeast Asia have seen the fastest \ngrowth in maritime traffic since 2010. However, economic recovery and future growth will require \nshipping and port operations that are clean and minimize water and air pollution, ecosystem \ndegradation, greenhouse gas emissions, and the threats from transboundary communicable \ndiseases as evidenced by the current COVID-19 pandemic. This output will strengthen the \nexisting efforts of the selected countries in Asia and the Pacific (involving all ADB\u2019s subregional \nprograms) in greening and enhancing the resilience of ports by reducing the environmental impact \nand increasing the emergency response preparedness of ports for major health and other disaster \nrisks.  The  output  will  also  strengthen  ADB\u2019s  collaboration  with  the  private  sector  in  port \ndevelopment. Development of green and resilient ports and other maritime transport infrastructure \nwill also help ensure the security of transport connectivity in case of any health-related crisis, and \nreduce risks from operations on surrounding cities and communities.  \n \n11.  A study will be conducted to (i) guide voluntary efforts by the selected regional ports in \nadopting standards and practices that are aligned with international norms; (ii) explore the \nfeasibility of and develop a business plan for setting up a facility to help port authorities and port \noperators improve infrastructure and practices for complying with improved standards; and (iii) \nidentify opportunities for ADB to work with port authority associations, private terminal operator \nassociations, and other parties in facilitating peer-to-peer dialogue and knowledge sharing on \nsound environmental, disaster, and health management practices and emergency preparedness; \ncoordinating  sovereign  policy  actions;  and  catalyzing  green  and  resilient  port  investments \n(including nonsovereign investments) in Asia and the Pacific.   \n \n9 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \n \n12.  Output 2: Knowledge on regional tourism value chains for recovery and resilience \nimproved. This output supports regional tourism and travel services value chain development \nunder the RCI-OP\u2019s trade and investment pillar. Tourism receipts and business travel are very \nimportant for developing Asia, accounting for more than 10% of GDP in almost half of ADB\u2019s \nmembers and more than 40% for some economies like Maldives and Palau. Tourism has been \none of the industries worst affected by COVID-19, with international tourism arrivals into Asia and \nthe Pacific dropping by 98% in April.10 Recovery of the tourism industry is expected to be slow. \nThis presents a challenge for Asia and the Pacific to reduce the immediate negative economic \nand social impacts, but also presents an opportunity to orientate recovery efforts to support long-\nterm sustainable development goals. It is therefore important for ADB, in the medium term, to \nstrengthen its support for the development of regional tourism value chains which contribute to \nresilient, inclusive, and sustainable growth.  \n  \n13.  This output will seek to identify initiatives that ADB can undertake with selected DMCs \n(including stakeholders from the public sector, private sector, and civil society) through its \nsubregional programs to strengthen the resilience of the regional tourism (and business travel) \nvalue  chains  against  transboundary  health  risks  and  support  post-COVID-19  recovery. \nSpecifically, this output will (i) increase knowledge on the contribution of tourism to resilient, \ninclusive, and sustainable trade and economic development within Asia and the Pacific; (ii) \nidentify  and  understand  key  intervention  areas  and  policy  recommendations  for  regional \ncooperation on tourism; (iii) conduct a scoping study for trialing an innovative solution in one key \nidentified intervention area; and (iv) understand and identify ADB\u2019s comparative advantage in \nproviding financing for regional cooperation on tourism after COVID-19 and leveraging multiple \nenabling  sectors,  such  as  urban  infrastructure  and  biodiversity,  as  well  as  private  sector \ninvestments. Emphasis will be on medium-term recommendations for the recovery of the tourism \nindustry (e.g., through opportunities offered by domestic tourism and travel bubbles) and its long-\nterm sustainability. Special attention will be paid to identifying measures that could mitigate health \nrisk impacts on the participation of vulnerable groups (e.g., enterprises led by women, and border \ncommunities) in the tourism value chains. \n \n14.  Output 3: Opportunities to cooperate for resilient and sustainable livelihoods in \natoll nations explored. This output responds to the priority that the RCI-OP places on supporting \nRPG-related operations, especially in the most vulnerable countries like SIDSs. The four low-lying \nnations of Kiribati, Maldives, Marshall Islands, and Tuvalu are facing the dual threats of climate \nchange (particularly sea-level rise) and health risks like COVID-19, which are often exacerbated \nby the weak institutional capacity in these atoll nations. The rapid spread of COVID-19 and the \nbreakdown of global supply chains aggravated their preexisting vulnerability, particularly given \ntheir dependence on imported food and medical supplies. In recent years, the leaders of atoll \nnations have started to establish platforms and fora to discuss and jointly address their shared \nrisks and challenges.11 \n \n15.  A study will be conducted to identify key opportunities for collaboration among the atolls \nin the Pacific and South Asia in designing integrated solutions to tackle their vulnerabilities. In line \nwith the priorities outlined by atoll nations, the study will identify opportunities and recommend \nactions for developing blue economies (such as sustainable tourism and fisheries) through \n \n10 Percentage decrease is year to date change.

The  study  will  support  ADB\u2019s  Action  Plan  for  Healthy  Oceans  and \nSustainable  Blue  Economies 12  and  will  build  on  ADB\u2019s  existing  knowledge  on  regional \napproaches to hazard surveillance, disaster risk finance, and sustainable use of marine resources. \nThe  findings  of  the  study  will  inform  the  design  of  future  investment  projects  (including \nnonsovereign projects) to be financed by ADB and development partners. This output will also \nstrengthen the institutional capacity in the atoll nations and improve the existing platforms for \ndialogue among them. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,500,000,13 of which (i) $2,000,000 for outputs 1 and 2 will \nbe  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  United  Kingdom  Fund  for  Asia  Regional  Trade  and \nConnectivity (ARTCF) under the Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing Partnership \nFacility and administered by ADB; and (ii) $500,000 for output 3 will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund.14 The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 2.  \n \n17.  For the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund, eligible expenditures for financing \ninclude (i) operational expenses of the TA in the form of consulting services, (ii) training and \ncapacity development for eligible DMCs, and (iii) minimal equipment and other goods which \nthough eligible are not expected to be incurred under this project. Civil works and procurement of \nlarge-scale equipment (such as machinery and other capital equipment) and salary for permanent \nstaff of TA executing and/or implementing agencies are typical noneligible expenditures. The \nARTCF will undertake TA activities in eligible countries as specified under the fund guidelines \nand/or as agreed with the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom \n(DFID). It will finance TA operational expenses in the form of consulting services; training events, \nconferences, and workshops; and related activities. It will not be used for civil works, procurement \nof large-scale equipment, and permanent staffing costs.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  ADB, through the Regional Cooperation and Integration Thematic Group, will administer \nthe TA during December 2020\u2212November 2023. A One ADB approach will be applied in TA \nimplementation as well as monitoring and evaluation of the outputs, with close collaboration with \nregional departments (including resident missions in the participating DMCs), the Economic \nResearch and Regional Cooperation Department, the Private Sector Operations Department, and \nrelevant sector and thematic groups. The TA will build on existing work in regional departments \nunder  ADB\u2019s  subregional  programs  and  focus  on  filling  the  gaps  and  strengthening  the \nintersubregional links in the areas covered. Selection of DMCs to participate in the TA will be done \nin consultation with regional departments. Government concurrence for country-level activities will \nbe secured before TA activities are implemented. Findings and recommendations and knowledge \ngenerated under the TA will be widely disseminated through multicountry forums, knowledge \nsharing events, web-based channels, and policy dialogues organized under ADB\u2019s subregional \n \n12 The Action Plan for Healthy Oceans and Sustainable Blue Economies was announced by ADB\u2019s President on 2 May \n2019 at the 52nd Annual Meeting of Board of Governors held in Fiji. The Action Plan aims to support the efforts of \nADB\u2019s DMCs to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 14 Life Below Water.  \n13 The scope of the TA may be expanded to include additional outputs on (i) supporting SMEs in mitigating the impact \nof the pandemic and improving their resilience to future health crises through regional financial cooperation and (ii) \npromoting knowledge and experience sharing among DMCs and across subregional programs on implementing the \nRCI-OP. Additional financing may be sought from other sources within the lifetime of the TA.  \n14 Established by ADB.
