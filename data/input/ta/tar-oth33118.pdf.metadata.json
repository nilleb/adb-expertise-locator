INTRODUCTION\n1. In 1981/82, a milestone study was undertaken by the Asian Development Bank (ADB)\nto comprehensively review its operations in previous years and develop strategies and policies\nfor operations in the 1980s. The study was guided by an external advisory group and financed\nby a regional technical assistance (TA) approved by the Board in March 1981.1 The staff\nupdated that study in 1986/87 to focus on ADB operations for the rest of the decade. Then in\nlate  1987,  in  response  to  suggestions  by  several  governors  from  both  developing  and\ndeveloped member countries, a study of ADB\u2019s role and operational strategies for the rest of\nthe century was initiated. The study was undertaken by an external panel of eminent persons\nand financed by a TA.2 The Panel Report The Asian Development Bank in the 1990s, also\nknown as the Okita Report, ushered the adoption of a formal strategic planning process by\nADB and the formulation of a long-term strategic framework that would guide its transformation\ninto a more broad-based development institution in the 1990s.\n2. In late 1997, ADB initiated the groundwork to review its vision for the start of the new\nmillenium and to update its long-term strategy. Aside from the increasingly complex challenges\nposed by  globalization  and  the  increasing  constraints  on  sources  of  official  development\nassistance, the causes and effects of the Asian crisis required a fundamental review of the key\nproblems of regional economies and an assessment of ADB\u2019s role in responding to those\nproblems. Realizing that it stood at an important crossroad in the fight against poverty in the\nregion where the majority of the world\u2019s poor lived, in 1999 ADB took another milestone\nstrategic step. It made poverty reduction its single, overarching objective. That sharpened\npoverty reduction mission underpins a long-term strategic framework (LTSF) that is under\npreparation by ADB. The LTSF will guide ADB\u2019s operations through the next half-a-generation,\ni.e., the period 2001-2015, taking into account the constraints on its own financial and human\nresources. In formulating the LTSF, ADB must engage its stakeholders in an open and candid\ndialogue on the relevance and responsiveness  of  the  directions,  priorities,  and  operating\nprinciples to be incorporated in the LTSF. Given its success as a feedback mechanism in the\npast,  a  high-level  external  panel  is  proposed  to  advise  ADB  on  strategic  issues  and\nimplications  as  ADB  completes  its  preparation  of  the  LTSF  for  2001-2015.  It  is  further\nproposed that such a panel be financed through a TA. The TA, for which a logical framework is\npresented  in  Appendix  1,  has  been  endorsed  by  the  Regional  TA  Screening  Committee\nchaired by the two Regional Vice Presidents.3\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n3. The  environment  for  development  and  poverty  reduction  in  the  Asian  and  Pacific\nRegion has changed dramatically in recent years, particularly after the onset of the Asian crisis\nin July 1997. That crisis must be placed in context: Asia, in particular East and Southeast Asia,\nentered the 1990s with a record of historically unprecedented developmental achievements\nover the past 30 years. Until the onset of the Asian crisis, the economies of the region had\nshown sustained high growth rates over an extended period. This growth was accompanied by\na dramatic decline in the incidence of absolute poverty (although, in absolute terms, poverty\n                                               \n1  R9-81: Revision 1: Technical Assistance for Study of the Bank\u2019s Operational Priorities and Plans for the 1980s,\n6 March.\n2  R118-87: Technical Assistance for Study of Role of the Bank in the 1990s, 23 September.\n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet Edition) in April 2000.", "2\nhas remained virtually stagnant), with significant increases in per capita incomes and dramatic\nimprovements in critical social indicators, including life expectancy, health, and education. The\nsocioeconomic progress of the East Asian economies was driven by private investment, both\ndomestic and foreign, supported by effective macroeconomic policies of governments. Over\nthe past two decades, an improved policy environment in South Asia has also led to higher\ngrowth and social development.\n4. Rapid growth was, however, accompanied by environmental  degradation,  resource\ndepletion, and an increasingly unequal distribution of income and wealth. Furthermore, not all\ncountries  shared  equally  in  the  benefits  of  the  region\u2019s  growth  and  development.  Some\ncountries were left outside of what was seen as a \u201cvirtuous circle of development,\u201d as were\nparticular groups within countries. Nevertheless, on balance, there has been a remarkable and\nhistorically  unmatched  record  of  sustained  development,  whose  significant  long-term\nachievements and implications cannot be erased or devalued by the recent crisis.\n5. The Asian crisis has unveiled crucial structural weaknesses in many of the region\u2019s\neconomies  and  has  set  back  poverty  reduction  by  many  years.  The  crisis  revealed  that\nsustained rapid growth in the region put overwhelming pressures on corporate management\nand performance, on the role of government, and on financial institutions. More fundamentally,\nthe crisis brought under scrutiny the \u201cAsian model\u201d of development: some strategies, policies,\nand programs that were only recently seen as driving the \u201cAsian miracle,\u201d are now seen by\nsome  as  having  contributed  to  the  Asian  crisis.  At  the  same  time,  population  growth,\nparticularly in South Asia, continues to frustrate poverty reduction efforts and the reversal of\nenvironmental degradation. Over the next decade, the region will inevitably face the challenge\nof  accelerating  globalization,  including  the  challenges  relating  to  the  rapid  spread  of\ninformation technology.\n6. In  summary,  new  regional  paradigms  for  pro-poor,  sustainable  growth  must  be\ndeveloped;  fundamentally  new  challenges  face  development  in  the  developing  member\ncountries (DMCs); new priorities in development strategies are called for; and, therefore, new\nways of doing business by ADB are expected, possibly including organization and process\nrestructuring, and definitely including new approaches, techniques, and modalities. Against this\ndramatic backdrop, country-specific poverty reduction strategies of the DMCs will have to be\nreassessed and ADB\u2019s own LTSF reformulated. The challenge for the DMCs is to reassess\npast and recent experience and consider \u201calternative futures,\u201d so as to identify the necessary\nfoundations for long-term, sustainable, and equitable growth\u2014anchored in the region\u2019s actual\nexperience and needs. The challenge for ADB is to define the developmental role that it can\nplay in the region, and to delineate how it can play that role more efficiently and effectively.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objective\n7. To deepen ADB\u2019s relevance and sustain its responsiveness to stakeholder needs,\nparticularly the needs of the poor, a broad consensus on ADB\u2019s strategic priorities over the\nlong term must be reached among DMCs, donor governments, nongovernment organizations,\nprivate sector representatives, civil society including the poor, and ADB\u2019s management and\nstaff. Sufficient stakeholder ownership of those priorities needs to be secured. It is particularly\nimportant that an effective merging, or reconciliation, of the views of DMCs and those of the", "3\ndonor governments be embodied in ADB\u2019s LTSF. It is proposed that an external advisory panel\nof distinguished public and private sector leaders who have played major roles in successful\nAsian  economies  where  poverty  was  reduced,  or  internationally  recognized  experts  in\ndevelopment management with hands-on experience in poverty reduction programs, assist\nADB in this process of reassessment, building consensus, and securing stakeholder ownership\nfor its long-term strategy.\n8. In this context, the objective of the proposed TA will be to fund the creation of such a\npanel and its advisory assistance to ADB in the development of the LTSF for 2001-2015. That\nassistance will consist of undertaking high-level stakeholder consultations for ADB in selected\ncountries; holding a series of feedback sessions with the management, staff, and the Board of\nADB; and reviewing progressive drafts of the LTSF. The panel will comprise nine persons to\nkeep  its  size  manageable  while  ensuring  balanced  representation  from  developing  and\ndeveloped member countries, and from regional and nonregional countries. All panel members\nwill possess in-depth knowledge of the Asian experience and will be expected to provide\npenetrating and wide-ranging insights of added value in the formulation of the LTSF.\nB.  Scope\n9. Specifically, the panel will assist in the preparation of the LTSF as follows:\n(i)  visit  selected  DMCs  and  donor  countries  to  exchange  views  on  long-term\nstrategic options and priorities with a range of stakeholders, from high-level\ngovernment officials to representatives of civil society;\n(ii)  advise ADB management and staff in a series of planning sessions on a range\nof strategic issues as specified in Appendix 2; and\n(iii)  comment on successive LTSF drafts to be provided by ADB.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n10. The TA is estimated at $700,000 (Appendix 3) and will be financed by ADB on a grant\nbasis from the ADB-funded TA Program.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n11. The TA will cover (i) consultation trips by teams of panel members  to  capitals  of\nselected DMCs and donor countries; (ii) three full panel sessions within the region with ADB\nmanagement/staff  and  other  specifically  invited  resource  persons,  as  necessary;  (iii)  an\ninternational consultant who will act as overall coordinator and facilitator of panel activities; and\n(iv)  a  domestic  consultant  to  help  the  latter  and  the  panel  as  a  whole  in  research  and\ndocument preparation.\n1.  Panel Sessions and Consultations\n12. The first panel session is planned in Manila after the ADB annual meeting in May 2000.\nThe panel will engage ADB management, staff, and the Board in an initial discussion of key\nissues addressed in the LTSF. The second session will be held in another DMC in June/July", "4\n2000. It will allow the panel to test out and receive direct feedback on an initial synthesis of the\npanel\u2019s  assessments  from  invited  stakeholder  representatives  from  DMCs  and  selected\nresource persons. The third, and concluding, panel session will be held again in Manila in\nSeptember/October 2000 with participation by selected DMC representatives. It will provide the\npanel an opportunity to present a final synthesis of its findings and advisory inputs to ADB, and\nthe Board of Directors. Each of the three panel sessions is planned to last two days. To ensure\neffective consideration of donor views, teams of Panel members will undertake consultation\nmissions to two European capitals, a North American capital, and Japan. These consultations\nwill take a full day each.\n2.  Consultants\n13. The international consultant will make detailed plans of the panel\u2019s activities and act as\nits overall coordinator, under the general supervision of the Strategy and Policy Department\n(SPD) of ADB. The international consultant will be expected to provide the informational and\nintellectual framework for the panel\u2019s work, and must have extensive advisory experience at\nthe policy level in the region as well as familiarity with ADB operations. The international\nconsultant will be expected to assist at key stages throughout TA implementation and serve for\n90 person-days. The international consultant and SPD  will be continuously assisted by a\ndomestic consultant (Philippines) throughout TA implementation. (The terms of reference for\nthe international consultant and the supporting domestic consultant are in Appendix 4.) The\nADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants will be followed.\n3.  Implementation Schedule and Executing Agency\n14. The TA is proposed to be implemented from April to October 2000. Inputs from the TA\nduring its implementation will be fed progressively into ADB\u2019s preparation of the LTSF and,\nupon  TA  completion,  into  finalization  of  the  LTSF.  The  LTSF  is  scheduled  for  Board\nconsideration in December 2000. The SPD will act as Executing Agency for the TA. Senior\nSPD staff, supported by other senior staff of ADB, will be assigned on a full-time basis to\ndefine the focus and priorities of the panel and its consultants.\nIV.
