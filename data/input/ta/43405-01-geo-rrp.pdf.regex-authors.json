THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to Georgia for the Urban Services Improvement Investment \nProgram.1 \n \n2.  The  proposed  investment  program  will  improve  water  supply  and  sanitation  (WSS) \nservices in six secondary towns of Georgia. It will (i) improve infrastructure by rehabilitating, \nreconstructing, and expanding WSS services; (ii) strengthen institutional effectiveness by (a) \nimproving the technical and management  capacities of the key WSS service provider,  the \nUnited Water Supply Company of Georgia Limited Liability Company (UWSCG), by procuring \nthe services of an internationally reputed water operator to act as a management contractor, \nenabling  it  to  provide  efficient  WSS  services;  and  (b)  developing  the  capacity  of  sector \nregulators to regulate tariffs, services standards, environmental protection, and drinking water \nquality in the long term; and (iii) support the investment program implementation.2 \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n1.  Socioeconomic Context \n3.  Georgia has a population of 4.43 million and serves as an important nodal point for \ninterregional trade flows connecting the South Caucasus and landlocked Central Asia with the \nBlack Sea and Mediterranean basins. The country\u2019s current gross domestic product is $10.5 \nbillion, with annual growth of 5.9% in 2004\u20132009. With global recovery taking hold, Georgia\u2019s \ngross domestic product grew by 6.6% in the first half of 2010 on account of high growth in \nmanufacturing, trade, and transportation.  \n \n4.  Foreign direct investment (FDI) in Georgia is one of the principal drivers of economic \ngrowth over the last 5 years and is a major balancing factor for a sizeable trade deficit. While \nFDI declined sharply in 2008-2009 due to global financial crisis, it was counterbalanced by \ngrowing remittances and current account surpluses in 2010. The service sector accounted \nconsistently for a predominant share of total FDI, averaging nearly 60%, and continues to create \nemployment in urban centers and secondary towns. Based on third quarter 2010 figures, the \ngovernment expects FDI to reach 2009 levels and improve over time. By creating employment \nin secondary towns, the government will reduce poverty and complement its targeted social \nassistance program to improve living standards for the poor.3 \n \n5.  New employment opportunities will bring further rural-to-urban migration and burden \ninfrastructure and municipal service provision, such as WSS, in cities and secondary towns, with \ngrowing environmental impact and concomitant public health implications.4  Improved municipal \nservices, and specifically WSS, are therefore a key government priority. This is highlighted in \nthe context of major urban centers, such as Kutaisi, Poti, Rustavi, Tbilisi, and Zugdidi where \nlarger  populations  increase  demand  for  municipal  services  and  apply  greater  pressure  on \nservice delivery. Urban centers in traditional tourist destinations such as Kobuleti, Batumi, and, \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to Georgia for Preparing a Multitranche Financing Facility for the Urban Services \nImprovement Investment Program. Manila (TA 7487-GEO, for $493,500, approved on 5 January).  \n3  Around 21% of the country\u2019s population live in poverty, including 8.8% in extreme poverty. \n4  About 2.34 million people, or 53% of total population, reside in urban centers. ", "2 \nmost recently, Mestia serve as important magnets for tourists and are expected to witness \nsimilar pressures on municipal service delivery in the medium term. \n \n2.  Sector Problems and Constraints \n6.  Institutional  arrangements.  The  State  Commission  on  Water  Supply  and  Energy \ndirects WSS policy, and the Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure (MRDI) is \nresponsible for developing infrastructure, guiding investment, and administering line agencies. \nSector regulatory bodies include the Georgia National Energy and Water Supply Regulatory \nCommission  (GNEWSRC)  for  service  standard  and  economic  regulation,  the  Ministry  of \nEnvironmental Protection and Natural Resources (MEPNR) for environmental monitoring, and \nthe Ministry of Agriculture (MA) for monitoring drinking water quality.  \n \n7.  Service  providers.  Following  reforms  and  consolidation  during  2008\u20132010,5 WSS \nservices across Georgia are now provided by (i) Georgia Water and Power Company (GWPC) \nserving Tbilisi and Rustavi,6 (ii) Batumi Water Company (BWC) and Kobuleti Water Company \n(KWC) serving the Adjara Autonomous Republic,7 and (iii) UWSCG8 serving the rest of the \ncountry.  Improving  WSS  services  delivered  by  UWSCG  is  central  to  the  government\u2019s \nassessment of investment needs in the sector because (i) UWSCG covers 90% of the country\u2019s \ngeographic area and 60% of  its population, especially in the economically strategic urban \ncenters,  and  (ii)  WSS  services  provided  by  GWPC  and  the  Adjara  water  companies  are \nseparately governed. The services provided by the privatized GWPC are governed through a \ncontract with the government, and services provided by the Adjara organizations are governed \nby the Adjara Autonomous Region. \n \n8.  Technical sustainability and environmental protection. While 88% of the country\u2019s \nurban population has access to piped water, only 70% of the urban population in the region \nserved by UWSCG has piped water supply. Only 15% of the urban population in that region has \naccess to a reticulated sewage disposal system. The absence of sewage treatment plants and \nnonfunctional sewage treatment plants in certain towns and cities harm the environment by \npolluting rivers and streams. \n \n9.  Financial sustainability. UWSCG is a fledgling organization and currently refining its \nbusiness processes with assistance from development partners. UWSCG\u2019s revenue budget for \n2010 was $19.5 million. Its financial management requires significant improvement, as revenue \ncollection stood at 72% (49% domestic and 94% other) in the first half of 2010, during which \nrevenue was $3.62 million and expenditure $6.65 million, thus requiring a 50% government \nsubsidy.9 The average domestic WSS tariff set by GNEWSRC since 2010 is $0.15 per cubic \nmeter, against a cost recovery tariff of $0.21 per cubic meter as estimated by UWSCG. With \npoor collection efficiency, the operating ratio (expenditures to revenue) is expected to increase \nover time if adequate revenue enhancement measures are not expeditiously pursued. \n                                                \n5  Reforms included amalgamating 66 local water companies across the country. \n6  GWPC manages the Gardabani, Mskheta, Rustavi, and Tbilisi water companies, which were privatized in 2008. \n7  WSS improvement in the Adjara Autonomous Republic is financed by German development cooperation through \nKfW.  BWC and KWC report to the Adjara Autonomous Region.  \n8  UWSCG is a public limited liability company established in 2010 and wholly owned by the government. While it has \nits own day-to-day management team, it is controlled by and reports to MRDI. Following reform and restructuring, \nUWSCG owns and operates a range of WSS sector assets located in the areas it services, many of which were \nformerly owned by local governments and water companies. Sector Assessment (Summary): Water Supply and \nSanitation (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n9  Revenue collection from domestic consumers is poor because consumers resist paying for poor service. \n ", "3 \n3.  Sector Policy, Strategy, and Road Map \n10.  Improved urban WSS service is a key priority of the government, as it is essential to \nimproving the quality of life, attracting investment, and raising productivity and competitiveness. \nRecognizing the need to overcome current problems and constraints, the government\u2019s urban \nWSS sector development plan (SDP) for 2011\u20132020, approved on 31 January 2011, aims to \nensure continuous and reliable water supply and safe sanitation services to all urban residents \nby 2020. The SDP\u2019s policy and institutional reform framework has a strong focus on technical \nsustainability of WSS services, environmental and natural resource protection, public-private \npartnerships,  tariff  rationalization,  prudent  financial  management,  and  improved  sector \nregulation through an enabling legislative and regulatory frameworks for WSS services.  \n \n11.  The long-term investment plan (2011\u20132020) under the SDP is estimated at $1.65 billion, \ncomprising physical10 and nonphysical investments to address medium-term (2011\u20132015) and \nlong-term (2016\u20132020) needs (Table 1).  \n \nTable 1: Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Investment Plan Estimates \n($ million) \nItem  2011\u20132015  2016\u20132020  Total  Share of Total (%) \nInfrastructure improvement  1,285.00  285.00  1,570.00  95.44 \nInstitutional effectiveness  15.00  5.00  20.00  1.22 \nProject management  45.00  10.00  55.00  3.34 \n  Total  1,345.00  300.00  1,645.00  100.00 \nSource: Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure estimates. \n \n12.  The SDP objectives are fully consistent with the approach agreed between Georgia and \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the purposes of ADB\u2019s assistance program in the \ncountry11 and in line with the principal elements of ADB\u2019s water policy12 and ADB\u2019s proposed \nwater operational framework 2020. \n \n4.  Development Partner Coordination \n13.  Development  partner  coordination  has  in  the  past  provided  the  government  with \nopportunities to synergize interventions and capitalize on available best practices. The World \nBank and ADB have provided  a significant portion of the funds invested in improving the \ncountry\u2019s WSS infrastructure.13 Lessons are that physical investment requirements exceed the \nfinancing  available  from  any  individual  institution  and  should  be  combined  with  significant \nreforms in the sector to improve the quality of WSS services. Regular consultations were held \nwith  the  European  Investment  Bank  and  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and \nDevelopment to coordinate interventions, identify synergies and cooperation opportunities, and \nexclude overlap and duplication. ADB will consider joint and parallel cofinancing partnerships \nduring subsequent tranches of the MFF and during investment program implementation. \n \n                                                \n10 Physical investments are identified for UWSCG alone, as GWPC, BWC, KWC, and Adjara local self-governments \nhave or will develop their own investment plans, given their autonomous management structures. \n11 ADB. 2007.

The investment program will improve the health of residents in the secondary towns of \nAnaklia, Kutaisi, Marneuli, Mestia, Poti, and Zugdidi. The outcome of the investment program is \nimproved WSS services in these secondary towns.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n1.  Component 1: Infrastructure Improvement \n15.  The first component will support infrastructure investments to rehabilitate, improve, and \nexpand WSS facilities in six secondary towns and benefit approximately 335,000 residents, or \n38% of urban residents in the region served by UWSCG (about 7.6% and 14.3% of the total and \nurban population, respectively, in Georgia).14 This includes system optimization and resource \nrationalization to improve service efficiency. It will provide vehicles and equipment for system \noperation and maintenance and for assessing system performance in these towns. It will also \nhelp Georgia reduce its carbon footprint by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and installing \nenergy efficient systems. \n \n2.  Component 2: Institutional Effectiveness \n16.  The second component will develop capacity in MRDI, MEPNR, MA, and GNEWSRC to \nsupport  more  effective  regulation  of  WSS  services.  It  will  finance  the  services  of  an \ninternationally  reputed  water  operator  as  a  management  contractor,  to  improve  UWSCG\u2019s \ntechnical, management, and financial performance, all fundamental for efficient WSS delivery. \nThrough these improvements, UWSCG will boost its revenues and creditworthiness. Over a 3-\nyear period, the management contractor will assist UWSCG in managing its operations and \nimproving the delivery of WSS services. By substituting for top and key management staff in the \nUWSCG head office and regional branches, the management contractor will undertake long-\nterm  capital  planning  and  asset  strengthening,  procurement,  the  supervision  of  capital \nimprovement works, system operation and maintenance, and improved financial management, \nincluding  improved  revenue  collection  efficiency  and  expenditure  management.  The \nmanagement contractor\u2019s fees will have fixed and variable components, with the latter linked to \nperformance  indicators  and  targets.  An  outline  scope  of  work  is  detailed  in  the  facility \nadministration manual (FAM).15 \n \n3.  Component 3: Project Implementation Support \n17.  The  third  component  will  support  project  implementation  with  focus  on  detailed \nengineering; construction supervision; procurement; safeguards compliance; preparation of the \nsubsequent tranches of the investment program; and a public awareness program on health, \nhygiene, sanitation, and water conservation. Consumer feedback through knowledge, attitude, \nand practice surveys will inform the design of the capacity-building programs. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n18.  Georgia has requested a MFF in an amount up to $500 million from ADB's ordinary \ncapital resources (OCR) and Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund (ADF)) to help \n                                                \n14 Kutaisi and Poti are being developed as special economic or free industrial zones, Marneuli and Zugdidi have agro-\nprocessing industries, and Mestia and Anaklia are being developed as tourist centers. \n15 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \nfinance the investment program, which will support in turn a slice of the SDP\u2019s medium-term \ninvestment requirement. The investment plan is summarized in Table 2.  \n \nTable 2: Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem    Investment Program  Project 1a \nA.  Base Costb      \n  1.

Interest during construction for Asian Development Bank \nloan(s) has  been  computed  at  the  5-year  forward London interbank offered  rate  plus a spread  of  0.4%. \nCommitment charges for an Asian Development Bank loan are 0.15% per year to be charged on the undisbursed \nloan amount.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n19.  Georgia\u2019s WSS SDP fits ADB\u2019s approach to infrastructure development in the country \nand allows ADB to enter into a long-term commitment with the government and development \npartners,  ensuring  a  comprehensive  approach to WSS  service  delivery.  On  account  of  its \nflexibility and ability to finance investments sequentially as each tranche becomes ready for \nimplementation,  the  MFF  allows  Georgia  to  focus  on  implementation  and  strengthen  the \ninstitutional and regulatory framework. By phasing investments over time, the MFF approach \nwould help Georgia manage its development financing more efficiently. With the certainty that \nthe basic investments will be covered, the MFF will also help Georgia focus on attracting greater \nprivate sector participation. For instance, the government is working with ADB to structure \nconstruction and management of sewage treatment plants on a design-build-operate basis. \n \n20.  The  MFF  is  anticipated  to  consist  of  four  tranches,  subject  to  the  government's \nsubmission of related periodic financing requests, execution of the related loan and project \nagreements for each tranche, and fulfillment of terms and conditions and undertakings set forth \nin the framework financing agreement. The OCR financing will follow the ordinary operations \nloan regulations applicable to London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based loans, subject to \npossible modifications under individual loan agreements. The ADF financing will follow the \nspecial  operations  loan  regulations,  subject  to  possible  modifications  under  individual  loan \nagreements.. \n \n21.  The first tranche, for $80 million equivalent, will be financed by the ADF and have a 32-\nyear term, including a grace period of 8 years, an annual interest rate of 1% per annum during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin the loan and project agreements for tranche 1. Interest during construction will be capitalized \nin the loan. For the first tranche, the government will relend part of the loan to UWSCG under \nthe same terms and conditions, and in dollars. Foreign exchange risk will be borne by UWSCG. \nThe remainder of the loan will be made available to MRDI. The government critically needs ADF \nresources to immediately invest in much-needed infrastructure and limit the financial burden on \nUWSCG.  Since the  investments  are  accompanied  by  reforms,  ADF resources  will  provide \nUWSCG the flexibility it requires to initially improve its financial management with limited debt \nburden and position it to absorb OCR resources in the later years. \n \n ", "6 \n22.  The government has specifically requested flexibility in the use of ADF resources for \nsubsequent tranches. It is understood that the provision of any such additional ADF financing \nwill entail a corresponding reduction in OCR financing available, so that total financing provided \nby  ADB  under  the  MFF  will  not  exceed  the  aggregate  principal  amount  of  $500  million \nequivalent. Any additional ADF allocation will be subject to (i) the general availability of ADF \nresources from time to time, (ii) Georgia\u2019s access to such resources pursuant to ADB\u2019s then \napplicable Graduation Policy16 and the requirements of ADF donors, and (iii) the availability of \nsuch resources to Georgia pursuant to ADB\u2019s then applicable policy on the performance-based \nallocation of ADF resources.17 The financing plan is summarized in Table 3. \n \nTable 3: Financing Plan \nGovernment\u2019s    Share \nInvestment  Share of  Investment  of  Share of \nPlan  Total  Program  Total  Project 1  Total \nSource  ($ million)  (%)  ($ million)  (%)  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank  500.00  30.40    500.00  80.00  80.00  76.19 \nCofinanciersa  300.00  18.24    \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026 \nGovernment  845.00  51.36    125.00  20.00  25.00  23.81 \n  Total  1,645.00  100.00    625.00  100.00  105.00  100.00 \n\u2026 = not available. \na  Under discussion. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n23.  MRDI will be the investment program's executing agency and the implementing agency \nfor component 2; UWSCG will be the implementing agency for components 1 and 3. Through \nthe investment program, MRDI will play an important role in implementing the nonphysical \ninvestments identified in the SDP and address its policy and institutional reform agenda. MRDI \nwill  oversee  the  management  contractor\u2019s  role  in  improving  UWSCG\u2019s  performance.  The \ngovernment will follow ADB\u2019s policies, including its Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time), Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time), and \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).

The outcomes of the management contract will provide the government a \nbasis and scope for enhancing and extending private sector participation in the sector. \n(iii)  Component 3: Project implementation support. Support provided to UWSCG for \ndetailed engineering; construction supervision; procurement; safeguards compliance; \npreparing subsequent projects of the investment program; and a public awareness \nprogram on health, hygiene, sanitation, and water conservation. \n \n25.  An ongoing ADB technical assistance to develop a geospatial WSS utility management \nsystem18 and consultants appointed for developing detailed engineering designs under advance \ncontracting actions will provide designs and cost estimates for WSS network rehabilitation or \nreconstruction,  and  parameters  for  constructing  treatment  plants  on  a  design-build-operate \nbasis.  Construction of WSS networks in all six investment program towns will be distributed \nacross subsequent projects planned over the next three years. Investments will be packaged \ninto distinct contracts based on hydraulic zones in each town and will include simultaneous \nconstruction of WSS systems. Sewage treatment plant construction will be staggered based on \nWSS network completion plans. Civil works contracts will combine construction and extended \ndefect-liability  periods  to  ensure  contractors  maintain  and  remain  accountable  for  system \nperformance for 3 years after the completion and commissioning of the system. The MFF is \ndesigned to include system operation and maintenance cost over the immediate 3-year period \nbeyond  the  completion  and  commissioning  of  infrastructure  to  provide  funds  for  service \nsustainability. \n                                                \n18 ADB. 2010.

Project 1 is financially viable, as the average financial internal rate \nof return  in  the  base case  is  7.6%,  which  exceeds the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital, \nestimated at 2.2%. Sensitivity analysis indicates that subprojects\u2019 financial internal rate of return \nis viable under stressed conditions, except for Zugdidi under a 20% increase in capital costs, \nillustrating  the  need  to  efficiently  estimate  market  rates  for  construction  items  to  reduce \nsubstantial  variance  in  capital  costs,  efficiently  implement  the  project,  and  rapidly  achieve \nphysical and financial targets. To achieve an operating ratio of less than unity, project 1 will \nensure (i) progressive tariff increases based on the principles of cost recovery and consumer \naffordability, and (ii) the availability of viability gap funding for service sustainability, including \ncounterpart funds and subventions for operation and maintenance and total debt service.19 \n \n27.  Economic analysis. Economic analysis was based on the results of a socioeconomic \nsurvey covering 1,600 randomly sampled households in six secondary towns and available \nnational  statistics,  especially  from  the  Department  of  Statistics.  Focus  group  discussions \nprovided further substantiation on service perception and demand for services. Project 1 is \neconomically viable, as the average economic internal rate of return in the base case is 19.5%, \nwhich exceeds the economic opportunity cost of capital, assumed at 12%. Sensitivity analysis \nfound economic viability stressed under various conditions, especially increased capital costs.20 \n \nB.  Governance \n28.  Public financial management reform is a priority for the government, and the Budget \nCode  adopted  in  2009  streamlined  the  budgeting  process.  The  basic  data  and  directions \ndocument  became  binding  with  the  legislation,  and  government  agencies\u2019  budgeting  and \nexpenditure management now follows the basic data and directions. A financial management \nassessment  of  UWSCG  indicated  that  significant  work  is  required  to  improve  its  financial \nmanagement,  accounting,  and  auditing,  which the  proposed management  contractor  under \ncomponent 2 will be tasked to improve. A procurement assessment indicated the need to build \nUWSCG staff capacity in ADB procurement procedures. Recognizing the requirement early in \nproject preparation, ADB supported UWSCG\u2019s procuring consulting services and goods through \nadvance  actions,  thereby  providing  on-the-job  training.  Civil  works  will  be  procured  with \nassistance from consulting firms. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government,  MRDI,  and  UWSCG.  Specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the FAM. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n29.  Project 1 will directly benefit 100,000 urban residents (4.3% of the country\u2019s urban \npopulation) and improve living conditions and the economic and urban environment of Anaklia, \nMarneuli, Mestia, and Zugdidi. Tourists in Anaklia and Mestia will benefit from improved water \nsupply. Specifically, beneficiaries will include (i) households affected when members become ill \nbecause of insufficient water or its poor quality and (ii) the poor, internally displaced, and \nhouseholds headed by women.20 The poverty and social assessment indicates that women \nstrongly  support  the  investment  program.  Women  perceive  that  it  will  improve  their  living \n                                                \n19 Analysis and Cash Flow Statements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nenvironment,  create  employment,  and  reduce  the  incidence  of  waterborne  illness.  Gender \nfeatures are integrated into the gender action plan that will include women in consultation and \nsurveys for developing a marketing campaign; women-focused customer care services; and \nawareness programs on health, hygiene, and consumer rights.21 \n \nD.  Safeguards \n30.  Environment.  Based  on  three  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs),  the \nenvironmental  classification  for  project  1  is  B,  as  it  will  not  have  significant  irreversible \nenvironmental  impacts  during  or  after  construction. 22  Consultation  was  undertaken  with \nstakeholders, and the IEE documents were translated in Georgian and displayed in each town. \nUWSCG will require the contractor to refine and implement the environmental management plan \nprepared  in  the  IEEs,  which  will  also  form  an  integral  part  of  construction  contracts.  The \ngovernment adopted an environmental assessment and review framework on 17 December \n2010, and environmental safeguards compliance for subsequent projects will be based on it.23 \nUWSCG does not meet certain legal requirements for environmental protection, as it discharges \ninto water bodies domestic sewage that does not meet environmental standards. Due to recent \nsector restructuring, it is not currently licensed to abstract  water as required. Through the \ninvestment program, UWSCG will construct sewage treatment plants and secure licenses for all \nwater abstraction sites in the six investment program towns, thereby ensuring environmental \nand natural resource protection. \n \n31.  Involuntary  resettlement.  Project  1  currently  includes  a  resettlement  plan  for  the \nMestia water intake and transmission facilities, with impact limited to temporary disturbance to \nland and lost hay within the pipeline corridor.24 As UWSCG will ensure that affected people are \ncompensated in line with detailed engineering design estimates confirming pipeline alignment, \nand prior to civil works commencement, project 1 is classified B. The government adopted on 17 \nDecember  2010  a  resettlement  framework  upon  which  social  safeguards  compliance  for \nsubsequent projects will be based.25 \n \n32.  Indigenous peoples. The investment program area does not include communities that \nmay be defined as indigenous peoples under ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The \nindigenous peoples' impact classification for all projects is C. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n33.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5. \n \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks    Mitigating Measures \nGovernment\u2019s inability to protect the    The investment program in the six towns will support the United \nenvironment and natural resources from  Water Supply Company of Georgia Limited Liability Company \nunregulated water abstraction and the  (UWSCG) in securing licenses for water abstraction and in \ndischarge of untreated sewage into water  constructing sewage treatment plants to meet sewage discharge \nbodies  standards compliant with national legislation. \nWeak capacity in UWSCG to improve access    The management contractor will support UWSCG in long-term \nto and the delivery of WSS services or  capital planning and asset strengthening, procurement, \nundertake business planning, tariff setting, or  supervising capital improvement works, operation and \n                                                \n21 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Initial Environmental Examinations (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nRisks    Mitigating Measures \nasset strengthening and management  maintenance, and financial management. \nLack of skilled  technical and managerial staff    The investment program will finance a WSS management \nin the country to deliver WSS services  program with technical assistance from Georgian universities \nefficiently  and develop the skills of UWSCG staff. \nInsufficient viability gap funding (VGF) for    In addition to determining VGF requirements during detailed \nfinancially sustainable service delivery from  engineering design and estimate preparation, UWSCG\u2019s prudent \nthe government to UWSCG early in the  financial management practices and revenue surplus generation \ninvestment program  plans will be programmed in the business plan to ensure that any \nVGF shortfalls are adequately managed. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n34.  The government and UWSCG have assured ADB that implementation of the investment \nprogram shall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the FAM and loan documents.  \n \n35.  The government and UWSCG have given ADB certain undertakings for the MFF, which \nare  set  forth  in  the  framework  financing  agreement.  Specific  covenants  agreed  by  the \ngovernment and UWSCG with respect to individual tranches under the MFF are set forth in the \nloan agreement and project agreement for the respective tranches. \n \n36.  No withdrawal will be made under the first tranche of the MFF until an agreement on \nimplementation of components 1 and 3, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, has been \nentered into by the government and UWSCG. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n37.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the provision of loans under the multitranche financing facility in an aggregate principal \namount  not  exceeding  $500,000,000  to  Georgia  for  the  Urban  Services  Improvement \nInvestment Program comprising: \n \n(i)  loans from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with interest and other terms to be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB's then applicable policies relating to Special \nFunds resources, subject to conditions set forth in paragraphs 20\u201322 of this report;
