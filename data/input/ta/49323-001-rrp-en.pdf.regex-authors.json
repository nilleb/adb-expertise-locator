THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof  up  to  $95,000,000  equivalent  in  yuan,  comprising  (i)  an  A  loan  of  up  to  $62,500,000 \nequivalent in yuan; and (ii) a complementary loan of up to $32,500,000 equivalent in yuan to the \nJiangsu Lihua Animal Husbandry Stock Company (Lihua) for the Inclusive and Sustainable \nLivestock Farming Project in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  Unfinished  modernization  of  agriculture.  Agriculture  has  developed  rapidly  and \ncontributed substantially to the PRC's overall economic development. However, the transition to \nmodern agriculture has not kept pace with urbanization and industrialization in the country. In \n2014, the per capita income of urban households was 2.75 times that of rural households.2 \nGiven  its  fundamental  contribution  to  food  security  and  improved  rural  livelihoods,  the \nGovernment  of  the  PRC  continues  to  prioritize  highly  the  modernization  of  agriculture, \nparticularly by encouraging stronger participation of private companies. \n \n3.  Increasing demand for animal proteins. The PRC is the world\u2019s largest consumer of \nmeat, with annual spending reaching $300 billion. Of all animal protein consumed in the PRC, \npork represents 50% and chicken 19%. Increasing demand for meat is driven by the rising \nmiddle class and changing diets associated with urbanization. The per capita consumption of \nchicken in the PRC (10 kilograms in 2015) is still only one third of that in Taipei, China, while the \nper capita consumption of pork (44 kilograms in 2015) is 35% less than in Hong Kong, China. \nThis indicates that the market will continue to grow significantly. \n \n4.  Animal disease and food safety issues. The growth of the livestock and meat industry \nhas been associated with serious animal disease and food safety issues, as demonstrated by \nthe repeated avian influenza outbreaks,3 the Huangpu River dead pig incident,4 and various fast \nfood poultry meat scandals5 during 2004\u20132015. The government has made significant progress \nin  animal  disease  prevention  and  food  safety  management,  but  ultimate  responsibility  for \nimplementing these measures remains with farmers and food producers. \n \n5.  Environmental concerns. If not properly managed, the development of the livestock \nindustry could harm the environment. Livestock farms produce waste with a high concentration \nof pollutants that is often discharged without proper treatment, polluting land and waterways and \ncausing  significant greenhouse gas  emissions.  Although the government  promotes  policies \nmandating waste treatment, most farms still lack proper waste treatment facilities.6 \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2016.  Transforming  Partnership:  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  Asian \nDevelopment Bank, 2016\u20132020. Manila. \n3  In 2004, 2006, and 2013. \n4  In March 2013, 16,000 dead pigs were found in the Huangpu River, which supplies Shanghai with drinking water. \n5  For example in December 2012, KFC was criticized for excessive antibiotic use by its poultry suppliers in the PRC. \n6  ADB.2015. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China for the Henan Sustainable Livestock Farming and Product Safety Demonstration Project. Manila. \n ", "2 \n6.  Livestock farming consolidation. To meet the growing demand for quality meat, the \ngovernment  is  supporting  the  development  of  modern  and  standardized  livestock  farms.7 \nLivestock  production  in  the  PRC  remains  highly  fragmented.  Large  pig  farms  (those  that \nproduce more than 500 pigs per year) represent only 35% of production; in contrast, in the \nUnited States large farms represent 84% of production.8 The involvement of medium- to large-\nscale private companies is necessary to facilitate the required investments and introduce best \npractices in livestock farming in terms of animal disease prevention, food safety, and animal \nwaste  management.  In  addition,  private  companies  are  able  to  work  in  partnership  with \nsmallholder  farmers  and  help  reduce  the  rural\u2013urban  income  gap  (another  government \nobjective), while retaining control of the critical steps of the production process to ensure the \nquality and safety of the final products. \n \n7.  Borrower\u2019s selection. Lihua is the second largest yellow chicken9 company in the PRC. \nIt is also involved in pig and goose farming. The project team identified Lihua as suitable for \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) support because of its (i) uniquely inclusive contract farming \nmodel, which offers smallholder farmers quality inputs, financial and technical assistance (TA), \nand guaranteed income; (ii) strong track record in poultry farming (since 1997) and pig farming \n(since 2011); and (iii) highly experienced management team led by Chairman Cheng Lili. Lihua \nis committed to adopting international best practices, including ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements, \nand to setting a benchmark for the livestock industry in the PRC.10 \n \n2.  Project Design \n8.  The project will promote a livestock farming business model that includes smallholder \nfarmers in a sustainable production process. ADB will support Lihua\u2019s $183 million investment \nplan during 2017\u20132019, including (i) breeder farm expansion, (ii) contract farming expansion, \n(iii) environmental capital expenditure, and (iv) animal health and food safety capital expenditure. \n \n9.  Breeder  farm  expansion.  Lihua\u2019s  breeder  farms  are  dedicated  to  the  in-house \nproduction of chicks and piglets, which are then provided to contract farmers for rearing into \ncommercial chickens and pigs. Chicks are produced by breeder or parent chickens. The parent \nchickens for the new breeder farms will be provided by the company\u2019s existing grandparent \nchicken farm in Jiangsu (Lihua has developed its own varieties of yellow chickens). Piglets are \nproduced by breeder sows and boars, which will be procured externally for the new breeder \nfarms from reputable international pig breeding stock companies such as the Pig Improvement \nCompany. \n \n10.  Contract farming expansion. The project will help Lihua develop new contract farming \narrangements  with  1,000  chicken  farmers  and  100  pig  farmers  (1,100  additional  farm \nhouseholds). Lihua has already been working with 4,400 chicken farmers and 100 pig farmers. \nLihua provides contract farmers with (i) quality inputs (chicks, piglets, feed, and veterinary \nproducts); and (ii) real-time TA (provided by 160 extension services agents employed by Lihua \nand trained in veterinary science), especially relating to disease control and prevention to \nensure the quality and safety of the final products. While chicken farmers have to invest in their \nown farms (supported by grants and subsidized loans provided by Lihua), pig contract farmers \n                                                \n7  Central  Committee  of  the  Communist  Party  of  China  and  Government  of  the  PRC.  2015.  Resolutions on \nAccelerating Agricultural Modernization by Enhancing Revolution and Innovation. Beijing. \n8  Guangdong Wen's Foodstuffs Group Company. 2013. Prospectus of the First Medium Term Note 2013. Beijing. \n9  Yellow-feather or yellow chicken is a breed of chicken traditionally raised for meat in the PRC, distinct from the \nmore common white-feather or white chicken (broiler). \n10 The term \u201clivestock\u201d is used to refer to all domesticated animals raised on farms, including poultry. \n ", "3 \nare provided space within the company\u2019s pig farm clusters (each cluster includes both a breeder \nfarm and farm space for around 50 contract farmers). Finally, to address farmers\u2019 vulnerability to \nnatural hazards and animal disease outbreaks, Lihua sets aside funds to create an insurance \npool that can cover up to 95% of the cost of dead animals. \n \n11.  Lihua\u2019s  unique  contract  farming  model  provides  an  attractive  and  stable  source  of \nincome for participating farmers. Lihua aims to set the annual farmer\u2019s income at a minimum of \n50% more than the average urban worker\u2019s salary  in the region.11 This means that Lihua \nguarantees an annual income of at least CNY100,000 per household, or around CNY24,400 per \ncapita, 26% more than the PRC\u2019s median per capita income of CNY19,281 in 2015.12 However, \nsince Lihua targets households in rural low-income segments, households typically more than \ndouble their income after joining Lihua\u2019s contract farming scheme. Previous occupations include \nfarming, factory work, construction work, and transportation services. According to ADB\u2019s due \ndiligence,  by  leaving  their  previous  occupations  and  partnering  with  Lihua,  farmers  obtain \nseveral benefits, including (i) a stable income, (ii) reduced and more flexible working hours, and \n(iii) the ability to live closer to their hometown to look after children and aging parents.13 \n \n12.  Environmental capital expenditure. To mitigate the risk of soil and water pollution \nassociated with large-scale livestock farms, the project will include investments in animal waste \ncollection, storage, and treatment. Chicken manure will be collected by conveyor belts under the \nchicken houses and pig manure will be collected by scraping solid floors, without using water for \nwashing. The manure will be sold to third party farmers living around Lihua\u2019s corporate farms for \nuse as organic fertilizer. Wastewater generated by pigs requires specific treatment in on-site \nwastewater treatment stations. The treated wastewater will be used to irrigate nearby farms. \nThe  proposed  capital  expenditure  will  help  Lihua  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009) requirements. \n \n13.  Animal health and food safety capital expenditure. High-quality feed is a key element \ncontributing  to  animal  health  and  food  safety.  High-quality  livestock  feed  improves  animal \nhealth, reduces the risk of disease and use of medicine (especially antibiotics), and increases \nthe quality of the finished products. The company will build its own feed processing plants on \nthe same sites as the company\u2019s chicken and pig breeding farms. As part of the project, the \ncompany will make other investments to ensure animal health and food safety (e.g., veterinary \nequipment,  testing  facilities,  temperature  and  humidity  control  systems,  and  information \nsystems). \n \n3.  The Borrower \n14.  Lihua is headquartered in Changzhou, Jiangsu. The company\u2019s existing poultry farms \nare located in the provinces of Anhui, Guangdong, Henan, Jiangsu, Shandong, and Zhejiang. \nThe company\u2019s pig farms are located in Jiangsu. As of 2015, Lihua\u2019s annual production was \naround 193 million yellow chickens and 192,500 pigs. Lihua was founded in 1997 by Cheng Lili, \nan animal health graduate and young entrepreneur at the time. In 1999, Lihua successfully \ndeveloped a new yellow chicken breed named \u201cSnow Mountain\u201d, and its yellow chicken farming \nbusiness started to grow quickly. In 2000, the company adopted the contract farming business \n                                                \n11 Lihua is able to achieve this by helping farmers invest in productive assets (chicken farms, chicks, and piglets) and \nby boosting farmers\u2019 productivity through high quality inputs and the TA provided. \n12 National Bureau of Statistics of China. 2016.

Beijing. \n ", "4 \nmodel to  accelerate  its  expansion.  In  2011, Lihua  began farming  pigs  as  a  diversification \nstrategy. In less than 20 years, Lihua has become one of the largest livestock companies in the \nPRC, with 3,000 employees as of 2015. \n \n15.  As of 2015, 91.4% of Lihua\u2019s revenue came from its chicken business, while 7.4% came \nfrom the pig business and 1.2% from the goose business. Lihua plans to ramp up its pig \nbusiness to further diversify its product base. At the same time, Lihua will continue to invest in \npoultry to safeguard its position in the market. In 2015, Lihua captured 5.2% of the PRC yellow-\nchicken market and 0.1% of the pig market. However, competitive pressure is limited since the \nchicken and pig sectors are both highly fragmented. \n \n16.  Lihua is a privately held company. Cheng Lili owns a 26.0% direct shareholding in the \ncompany, but controls 59.7% of the company\u2019s shares through his majority ownership in local \nprivate equity funds, which hold 33.7% of the company\u2019s shares. \n \nB.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n17.  Impacts. The project will set a benchmark in terms of smallholder farmer inclusion, \nenvironmental sustainability, animal health, and food safety practices for the livestock industry in \nthe  PRC.  The  project  is  fully  consistent  with  the  strategic  orientations  for  agricultural \nmodernization and rural development provided by the Central Committee of the Communist \n14\nParty of China and the State Council in its Document No. 1 in January 2016,  particularly its \ncalls  to  (i)  coordinate  agricultural  industry  chains  and  farmer  interests  more  closely,  (ii) \nstrengthen the governance of major agricultural environment problems, and (iii) implement a \nfood safety strategy. \n \n18.  Outcome. The  outcome  will  be  a  demonstrated  inclusive  and  sustainable  livestock \nfarming business model. The number of contract farmers will increase from 4,500 in 2015 to at \nleast 5,600 in 2020. New contract farming households will increase their annual income from \nCNY50,000\u2013CNY70,000  on  average  (before  joining  Lihua\u2019s  program)  to  CNY100,000\u2013\nCNY140,000.15 The project will also support job creation and preservation in rural areas. Lihua\u2019s \nworkforce is expected to increase from 3,000 (39% women) in 2015 to more than 4,500 (41% \nwomen) in 2020.16 Several of Lihua\u2019s existing and new farms are located in rural areas of some \nof the PRC\u2019s poorer provinces such as Anhui (25th out of 31 provinces in terms of gross \ndomestic product per capita), and Henan (22/31). Indicators as to waste treatment, animal \nhealth, and food safety are included in the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1. \n \n19.  Outputs.  The  outputs  will  be  (i)  constructed  breeder  farms,  (ii)  expanded  contract \nfarming, (iii) environmental capital expenditure, and (iv) animal health and food safety capital \nexpenditure.17 \n \n                                                \n14 Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council. 2016.

Beijing. \n15 Consultants were hired under Regional Technical Assistance 8809: Measuring the Development Effectiveness of \nPrivate Sector Operations (48909-001) to conduct an impact analysis to assess how the project will enhance the \nwelfare of contract farmers. Income and asset holding of new contract farmers before and after the project, and \nother potential project benefits, will be analyzed. \n16 The targeted increase in the proportion of women reflects Lihua\u2019s plans to hire and retain more women workers. \n17 Output indicators are in the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1. \n ", "5 \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n20.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is aligned with \nADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, which emphasizes the need to contribute to food \nsecurity and agricultural productivity, promote food safety and quality standards, and support \ninclusive  businesses  such  as  agribusinesses  that  connect  farmers  to  food  markets.18 The \nproject is also consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 for the PRC. To \nsupport  rural  development for  inclusive  economic growth,  ADB  will  help  the  PRC  develop \nsuitable methods to (i) modernize agriculture, (ii) promote circular agriculture, and (iii) improve \nfood safety. Through its private operations, ADB will support agribusiness projects that enhance \nproductivity, the inclusion of smallholder farmers in value chains, and food safety (footnote 2). \n \n21.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project fully \naligns with ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Agriculture and Natural Resources, which stresses that \nADB\u2019s private agribusiness investments \u201chave the potential to benefit millions of smallholder \nfarmers directly and contribute to public goods, such as food security, food safety, and reduced \nsoil and water pollution\u201d.19 The project builds on lessons from ADB\u2019s long history in the PRC\u2019s \nlivestock sector, particularly the need to achieve development impact through private agro-\nenterprises with sufficient scale and direct linkages with farmers.20 The project will complement \na PRC sovereign project approved in 2015, which will provide similar assistance to livestock \ncompanies in Henan (footnote 6). \n \nD.  Project Cost and Financing Plan \n[Redacted] \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  Table 3 summarizes the implementation arrangements. \n \nTable 3: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory  Lihua is subject to the general laws regulating private enterprises in the People\u2019s Republic of \nframework  China as they relate to large-scale livestock farming. In particular, Lihua is subject to (i) the \nAnimal Husbandry Law (2005); (ii) the Environmental Protection Law (2015); (iii) the Animal \nEpidemic Prevention Law (2007, amended in 2015); and (iv) the Food Safety Law (2009, \namended in 2015). \nManagement  Lihua is led by a management team with long experience in the livestock industry. Cheng Lili, \nLihua\u2019s chairperson, is an animal nutrition graduate with more than 30 years of experience in the \nlivestock industry. His management skills are a key factor driving Lihua\u2019s success. \nImplementation  It takes around 12 months to construct a feed mill, up to 24 months to set up a breeder chicken \nperiod  farm or pig farm cluster, and up 36 months to set up a breeder pig farm. \nConstruction  Equipment and civil works will be procured in line with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as \narrangements  amended from time to time) as they apply to private projects. ADB\u2019s technical consultant has \nreviewed the project costs (based on a sample of feasibility studies provided by the company), \nand found them to be in line with market standards. \nOperations  Lihua provides the chicks and piglets born on its breeding farms to contract farmers for rearing. \narrangements  The company provides contract farmers with financial and technical assistance, and buys back \n                                                \n18 ADB. 2014.

Chickens are sold to three types of customers: wet \nmarkets (the traditional sales channel), slaughterhouses, and frozen meat companies. Pigs are \nsold to traders (the traditional sales channel) or directly to pork-processing companies. \nPerformance  Lihua will report on key performance indicators, including financial, safeguard, gender, and \nmonitoring  development indicators (i.e., output and outcome targets), on at least an annual basis. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, Lihua = Jiangsu Lihua Animal Husbandry Stock Company. \nSources: Lihua; ADB. \n \nF.

The project is ADB\u2019s first inclusive business nonsovereign assistance to an agribusiness \ncompany  in  the  PRC.21 Lihua\u2019s  unique  contract  farming  model  will  provide  thousands  of \nsmallholder livestock farmers with a decent and stable income and serves as a model for the \nlivestock industry. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n24.  ADB proposes to provide a loan facility of up to $95.0 million equivalent in yuan to Lihua, \nconsisting of an A loan of up to $62.5 million equivalent in yuan and a complementary loan of up \nto $32.5 million equivalent in yuan. ADB will fund the A loan from its ordinary capital resources, \nand the complementary loan will be funded by commercial banks, with ADB acting as the lender \nof record. Lihua will use the loan proceeds to finance those of its subsidiaries that will be \nimplementing different components of the project. The terms and conditions for the A loan have \nbeen agreed upon with Lihua. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n25.  ADB assistance will add value on two fronts: \n(i)  Demonstration effect. ADB will help Lihua set a benchmark in terms of small \nholder farmer inclusion and sustainability in the PRC\u2019s livestock industry. ADB \nwill  enhance  Lihua\u2019s  standards  through  (a)  the  application  of  international \nsafeguard standards, and (b) the welfare impact analysis that will be conducted \nduring project implementation. ADB will increase the visibility of Lihua\u2019s business \nmodel, enabling other large- and medium-scale companies to learn from it. \n(ii)  Long-term  finance  mobilization.  So  far,  the  company  has  financed  its \nexpansion  through  equity  and  short-term  loans.  However,  the  investments \nincluded in the project have payback periods of 5\u201310 years. ADB will provide \nLihua with the required long-term financing and, through the complementary loan, \nencourage commercial banks to provide such long-term financing as well. \n \n                                                \n21 The project is an inclusive business assistance because (i) it provides income opportunities to low-income people \n(the per capita income of contract farmers before working with Lihua is CNY10,000\u2013CNY17,000 (lower than the \nPRC\u2019s median per capita income of CNY19,281 in 2015); (ii) it will, on average, more than double their income; \nand (iii) it includes innovative features (e.g., extension services and insurance), increasing farmers\u2019 resilience. \n ", "7 \nC.  Risks \n[Redacted] \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n26.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \ncategory  B  for  environment  and  involuntary  resettlement,  and  category  C  for  indigenous \npeoples. Since the proposed ADB assistance is a corporate loan that will finance general \nbusiness expansion and is not earmarked for financing specific subprojects, the requirements \nfor general corporate finance projects will apply. The project\u2019s potential environmental and \nsocial impacts have been identified, and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and \ncompensate for adverse impacts are incorporated in the safeguard reports and plans.22 The \nlivestock farms will be sited in coordination with the local government to ensure that they \nconform to local land use plans and avoid legally protected areas. Potential risks and impacts \nduring construction are mostly site-specific and short-term, and can be effectively managed by \ngood engineering construction and housekeeping practices implemented through a construction \nenvironmental management plan. During operation, the new animal waste treatment facilities \nwill mitigate concerns as to solid waste, including animal manure and wastewater treatment and \ndisposal, which have the potential to pollute soil, and surface and groundwater. Since the farms \nwill be located away from inhabited areas, nuisance, noise, and odor impacts will be mitigated. \nThe audit noted that the livestock farms visited fully comply with applicable regulations from the \nAnimal Epidemic Prevention Law of the PRC.23 \n \n27.  Lihua will either lease unused or abandoned lands on a willing lessor\u2013willing lessee \nbasis,  or  procure  state-owned  land  from  the  local  government.  In  case  of  unavoidable \ndisplacement, such as relocation related to a sanitation buffer zone set by local regulations, \nLihua will discuss and coordinate measures with the government to address any identified gaps. \nAny of Lihua\u2019s investment transactions entailing significant involuntary resettlement impacts will \nbe excluded from ADB financing. As the farms are expected to be developed in non-ethnic \nminority-concentrated provinces, impacts on indigenous peoples are unlikely. \n \n28.  Lihua engaged a qualified and experienced external expert to conduct a corporate audit \nof the company\u2019s existing environmental and social policy, procedures, and operations. The \naudit recommended corrective action to ensure that procedures and operations are adequate \nand comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and other social requirements. Lihua will \nadopt an environmental and social management system satisfactory to ADB before the first \nADB disbursement. Lihua will also enhance its institutional capacity, establish environment and \nsocial units at both corporate and farm levels, and train staff on the environmental and social \nmanagement system. \n \n29.  Lihua and its contractors will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s \nSocial  Protection  Strategy  (2001),  will  take  measures  to  comply  with  the  internationally \nrecognized  core  labor  standards.24 Lihua  will  report  regularly  to  ADB  on  (i)  its  and  its \n                                                \n22 Farms visited during the audit prepared the necessary safeguard reports and plans (environmental impact \nassessment registration forms), and approvals were obtained prior to operations. \n23 Farms visited during the audit have obtained Certificates for Meeting Animal Epidemic Prevention Conditions \ndemonstrating compliance with the Animal Epidemic Prevention Law. \n24 ADB. 2003.

Lihua will increase the percentage of its female staff from \n39% in 2015 to 41% in 2020, and will prioritize women applicants in the areas of finance, human \nresources, and laboratory work. Information disclosure and consultations with affected people \nwill be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n30.  Lihua was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n31.  The proposed loan is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and single-\nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n32.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the \nCharter), 25  ADB  will  proceed  with  the  proposed  assistance  upon  establishing  that  the \ngovernment has no objection to the proposed assistance to Lihua. ADB will enter into suitable \nfinance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the \nproposed assistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n33.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan facility would comply with the Articles of Agreement \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of up to \n$95,000,000 equivalent in yuan, comprising (i) an A loan of up to $62,500,000 equivalent in \nyuan from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources; and (ii) a complementary loan of up to $32,500,000 \nequivalent in yuan to the Jiangsu Lihua Animal Husbandry Stock Company for the Inclusive and \nSustainable Livestock Farming Project in the People\u2019s Republic of China, with such terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be \nreported to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n17 November 2016 \n                                                \n25 ADB. 1966.
