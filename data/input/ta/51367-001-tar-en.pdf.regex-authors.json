INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  proposed  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  assess  key \nsustainable infrastructure development issues and expand potential infrastructure investment \nopportunities for developing member countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).1 \nIt aligns with (i) the midterm review of ADB\u2019s Financial Sector Operational Plan (FSOP),2 which \naffirms ADB\u2019s role in infrastructure finance; and (ii) ADB\u2019s commitment to host the 2018 Global \nInfrastructure  Forum.3 Furthermore,  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs)  and  the \nagreement at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change (COP21)4 underline the importance of infrastructure finance, particularly the \nroles of the public and private sectors and multilateral development banks (MDBs). MDBs are \nincreasingly being called upon to play a role in the SDGs and COP21 agenda and are, along with \nother institutions, governments, and entities, advancing numerous related initiatives. ADB must \nrespond to these expectations and ensure that it continues to remain relevant and engaged in \nthese infrastructure finance initiatives. \n \n2.  The TA is an endorsed corporate priority TA.5 Strategy 2020 addresses the importance of \ninfrastructure  finance  as  a  core  specialization.6 The  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  20207 \nreconfirmed the focus areas of ADB\u2019s strategic support, which include finance.8  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Infrastructure  investment  is  a  key  component  of  the  2030  Agenda  for  Sustainable \nDevelopment and is recognized as a crucial driver of economic development.9 Because the \nquality, quantity, and accessibility of economic infrastructure in developing countries lag behind \nthose in advanced economies,10 scaling up infrastructure investment is a key pillar in many \nnational development strategies.11 After agreements on the SDGs and on climate change in 2015, \nmany developing countries have been scaling up green, inclusive, resilient, and technology-driven \ninfrastructure investments, mostly through public spending but also with growing private sector \n                                                \n1  ADB defines sustainable infrastructure as infrastructure that is designed, built, and operated to be durable, in ways \nthat are socially equitable and economically viable, while protecting the environment. \n2  ADB. 2017. Review of 2011 Financial Sector Operational Plan. Manila. The review draws findings, makes \nrecommendations up to 2020, and provides a platform to continue the Financial Sector Operational Plan (FSOP) \nbeyond 2020 to ensure its relevance with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.  \n3  The Global Infrastructure Forum is jointly organized on an annual basis by 10 multilateral development banks (MDBs) \nin close partnership with the United Nations (UN). The World Bank Group led the first Global Infrastructure Forum in \n2016, and the Inter-American Development Bank and the European Investment Bank jointly led the second forum in \n2017. Heads of the MDBs, as well as the UN secretary general, participate in the forum. \n4  The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is the UN body that deals with climate change issues and is \nbased in Bonn, Germany. The Conference of the Parties meets each year to take decisions that further the \nimplementation of the convention and to combat climate change. \n5  ADB heads of departments endorsed the TA at the Corporate Priority Framework Meeting held on 23 October 2017. \n6  ADB. 2008.

Enhancing infrastructure is a key component of \nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and is mentioned explicitly in SDG 6, SDG 7, and SDG 9. \n10  Confirmed by firm-level data compiled by the World Bank as part of the Enterprise Surveys indicating that such gaps \nare an actual constraint on real economic activity. \n11 IMF.  2017.

US. \nhttp://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2017/11/07/Trends-and-Challenges-in-Infrastructure-Investment-in-\nLow-Income-Developing-Countries-45339 \n ", "2 \nparticipation. However, many challenges lie ahead. The inability of sovereign and sub-sovereign \nagencies at DMCs to prepare a consistent supply of structured projects offering a standardized \nrisk transfer regime and satisfactory investment return remains a hurdle in channeling project \nsponsors  and  available  finance  into  infrastructure  development  activities.  The  high  costs \nassociated with the preparation of bid proposals for infrastructure projects are difficult to justify \nwhen the underlying projects themselves suffer from poor preparation, delays, and a lack of \ntransparency in the bid process. Bridging large infrastructure gaps will require tackling several \nproblems  in  terms  of  project  preparation,  additional  financing,  project  selection  and \nimplementation, the profile of cash flows, and the perception of high risks throughout the project \nlife cycle, which contribute to making private investment difficult to justify and costly to achieve. \nAn ADB study, Meeting Asia\u2019s Infrastructure Needs, highlighted that developing Asia will need to \ninvest $26.0 trillion from 2016 to 2030\u2014or $1.7 trillion per year, of which $200 billion relates to \nclimate change and climate adaptation costs\u2014for it to maintain its growth momentum, eradicate \npoverty, and respond to climate change.12 Of the total investment needs in 2016\u20132030, $14.7 \ntrillion will be for power and $8.4 trillion for transport. Investments in telecommunications will reach \n$2.3 trillion, with water and sanitation costs at $800 billion. Of the 25 economies that capture 96% \nof Developing Asia's population, the estimated gap between infrastructure investment needs and \ncurrent infrastructure investment levels is about 2.4% of projected gross domestic product over \n2016\u20132020. Without the People\u2019s Republic of China, the gap for the remaining economies rises \nto about 5% of their projected gross domestic product. \n \n4.  The inability to properly use available financing modalities to bridge the financing gap for \nsustainable infrastructure is a challenge. Similarly, there is a need to identify and develop \nalternative sources of investment finance. Mobilizing the necessary funds to satisfy the growing \ndemand for infrastructure investment will require new sources and instruments of finance. 13 The \nbanking system has traditionally played a major role in infrastructure development financed by \nthe private sector, which will continue to remain an important financier, particularly in the early \nstages of new projects. The private sector has been deleveraging since the global financial crisis \nin 2007\u20132008 and the European sovereign debt crisis that began in late 2009. Banks, which are \nsubject to greater regulatory controls under iterations of Basel capital control frameworks, are no \nlonger  best  placed  to  support  long-term  infrastructure  debt  commitments  on  their  balance \nsheets.14 More stringent banking capital regulation has led to a significantly diminished pool of \npotential lenders and a significantly higher cost of debt. At the same time, institutional investors \nallocate only a small fraction of their investments to infrastructure assets in developed and \ndeveloping countries. \n \n5.  Weak, undeveloped, or inconsistently applied regulatory environments and institutional \nframeworks for implementing infrastructure projects, including public\u2013private partnerships, in \nsustainable and efficient ways are challenges as well. Creating a pipeline of infrastructure projects \nthat  will  attract  broad-based  interest  from  the  private  sector,  including  pension  funds  and \ninsurance companies, requires a coherent and trusted legal framework in addition to a consistent \nand stable project implementation framework. In some countries, those frameworks do not exist \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2017. Meeting Asia\u2019s Infrastructure Needs. Manila. \n13 Financing sources include green, social, and sustainability bonds; blended finance; and green Islamic finance. The \nTA will also catalyze green finance and credit guarantees. Examples of infrastructure technology include smart cities \nand/or grids, drones, autonomous vehicles, internet of things (a system of interconnected devices that can exchange \ndata without interacting with people and computers), big data analytics (voluminous amounts of structured or \nunstructured data that organizations can potentially mine and analyze for business gains), artificial intelligence, and \nremote device management. \n14 Bank  for  International  Settlements.  Basel  III:  International  Regulatory  Frameworks  for  Banks. \nhttps://www.bis.org/bcbs/basel3.htm. \n ", "3 \nor are applied in an inconsistent manner. Political risk is also a concern of private investors and \ncan affect a project through its entire life cycle. \n \n6.  Another challenge is the insufficient capacity and capability of governments and public \ninvestment management institutions to identify, evaluate, prepare, and execute infrastructure \nprojects that comply with international best practices and/or integrate new technologies for \nsustainable  infrastructure  in,  for  example,  third-party  platforms  for  infrastructure  project \npreparation such as Source.15 This includes the selection of legal and financial expertise for the \ndevelopment and documentation of structured infrastructure investments. Such investments \nentail complex legal and financial arrangements, and require the provision of significant advisory \nsupport and internal management and administrative expenses. Gaining access to necessary \nexpertise is costly, and investors are more likely to incur such costs if there is a sufficient and \npredictable pipeline of infrastructure investment opportunities that are fixed and can be delivered \nover a predictable time frame. This issue of necessary expertise also includes weak public \ninvestment management institutions as well as the limited capacity of the public and private \nsectors to integrate new technologies for sustainable infrastructure. Currently, infrastructure such \nas transport, energy, and water accounts for about 70% of ADB operations. ADB will scale up \nannual infrastructure investments to at least $20 billion by 2020. ADB has also committed to raise \nprivate sector development and operations to 50% of total operations by 2020. To meet these \ntargets, the proposed TA will aim to expand investment opportunities in sustainable infrastructure. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: pipeline of sustainable infrastructure projects \naddressing SDG targets increased.16 The TA will have the following outcome: capacity of key \nstakeholders for the development of sustainable infrastructure improved.17 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  Output  1:  Project  preparation  to  better  develop  sustainable  infrastructure  for \ndeveloping member countries enhanced. This output will deliver two components. First is the \n2018 Global Infrastructure Forum. The forum is mandated by the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on \nFinancing for Development and is a flagship event on collaborative financing for infrastructure \ndevelopment in support of the SDGs.18 The Global Infrastructure Forum (i) aims to enhance \ncoordination  among  MDBs  and  their  development  partners  to  better  develop  sustainable, \naccessible, resilient, and quality infrastructure for developing countries; and (ii) focuses on how \ngovernments and their working partners can attract more resources for infrastructure. It will also \naddress measures that support a green, sustainable, resilient and inclusive technology driven \ninfrastructure. It is held annually and the responsibility for hosting the forum rotates among the \nMDBs. ADB will host the third Global Infrastructure Forum, which will be held in Bali, Indonesia in \n                                                \n15 Source is a cloud-based digital platform for infrastructure project preparation and can be accessed through http://sif-\nsource.org. It presents all aspects of development of an infrastructure project in a transparent, consistent, and \nefficient manner, using sector-specific sets of questions or templates.

Manila. \n ", "4 \nOctober 2018 on the sidelines of the World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund annual \nmeetings. \n \n9.  The second component of this output is to support better project preparation using Source \n(footnote 15), which is designed to (i) help public sector agencies prepare, manage, and publish \ntheir infrastructure projects; (ii) provide sovereign and nonsovereign projects with a standardized \napproach for preparing projects; and (iii) play a catalytic role in crowding in private sector \ninvestment  and  for  developing  a  pipeline  of  bankable  projects,  including  public\u2013private \npartnerships.  \n \n10.  Subscribing to the Source platform provides ADB and other stakeholders that use Source, \nsuch as other MDBs, development finance institutions, infrastructure investors, consultancy firms, \ncontractors and lenders, with access to (i) an online, scalable, collaborative, and secure working \nenvironment for data gathering and project management; (ii) a high-quality project preparation \nmethodology  for  38  infrastructure  subsectors;  (iii)  an  effective  communication  platform  for \nfeedback between the public and the private sector; and (iv) an efficient management of key data \nthroughout an infrastructure project\u2019s life cycle. The Government of Australia will work with ADB \nto support the platform. Source will be featured as a global platform for preparing infrastructure \nprojects at the third Global Infrastructure Forum. \n \n11.  Output 2: Analytical studies supporting sustainable, green, inclusive, resilient, and \ntechnology-driven infrastructure produced. In collaboration with operations departments, \nsector and thematic groups, and other relevant ADB departments, the TA will develop at least \nthree studies on key sustainable infrastructure issues faced by DMCs. It will explore a broader \nmix  of  financial  instruments  for  infrastructure  projects  as  well  as  support  the  collection  of \nsystematic and comparable international data on infrastructure projects through, for example, the \nfurther development of Source. At least one study will be featured at the third Global Infrastructure \nForum.19 \n \n12.  Output  3:  Investment  opportunities  supporting  sustainable,  green,  inclusive, \nresilient, and technology-driven infrastructure developed. In collaboration with operations \ndepartments and sector and thematic groups, the TA will develop at least one small-scale \nfeasibility study for an infrastructure pilot project to (i) evaluate the feasibility, timeline, cost, and \nthe possibility of adverse effects; and (ii) improve upon the study design prior to implementation \nof  a  full-scale  project.  The  feasibility  study  will  (i)  include  cross-sector  support,  innovative \nfinancing, and integration of technology solutions; (ii) identify an investment opportunity for a pilot \nproject in at least one DMC; and (iii) support capacity building of governments and public \ninvestment management institutions to prepare and execute infrastructure projects that comply \nwith international best practices and that integrate new technologies with a proven record for \nsustainable infrastructure. 20 \n \n                                                \n19 The development of analytical studies will be done in coordination with the Economic Research and Regional \nCooperation Department and the Strategy, Policy and Review Department. \n20 Financing sources include green, social, and sustainability bonds: blended finance; and green Islamic finance. The \nTA will also catalyze green finance and credit guarantees. Examples of infrastructure technology include smart cities \nand/or grids, drones, autonomous vehicles, internet of things (a system of interconnected devices that can exchange \ndata without interacting with people and computers), big data analytics (voluminous amounts of structured or \nunstructured data that organizations can potentially mine and analyze for business gains), artificial intelligence, and \nremote device management. \n ", "5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,750,000, of which (i) $1,500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6) and (ii) $250,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by the Government of Australia and administered by ADB. Key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB will administer the TA. The Sector Advisory Service Cluster of ADB\u2019s Sustainable \nDevelopment  and  Climate  Change  Department  will  implement  the  TA  and  carry  out  TA \nadministration and supervision, implementation oversight, accountability for the outputs, and \ncommunication with consultants and stakeholders in coordination with the Finance Sector Group \nand operations departments.

ADB will \nengage the consultants following the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to \ntime) and its associated project administration instructions and/or staff instructions.21 \n \n16.  Pilot testing of project approach. Pilot projects should add value to ongoing or pipeline \nprojects and be carried out in coordination with operations departments. ADB will develop the \nselection  criteria  to  identify  target  DMCs  that  will  participate  in  pilot  projects  during  TA \nimplementation and will confirm them during due diligence. Pilot projects are expected to take a \nparticipatory (cost-sharing) approach wherein partnering financial institutions will bear a portion \nof the project cost, including licensing fees and costs for maintenance. ADB will conduct due \ndiligence  on  the  pilot  projects. 22  The  activities  will  not  result  in  any  potential  adverse \nenvironmental and/or social impacts. \n \n17.  ADB\u2019s procurement. The procurement method to be used for goods and/or works is open \ncompetitive bidding or limited competitive bidding, as appropriate. ADB will subscribe to the \nSource platform for at least 3 years. Procurement will follow the ADB Procurement Policy and \nProcurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time).23 \n \n18.  Cofinancier requirements. ADB will invite the Government of Australia (the \u201cDonor\u201d) to \njoin TA review missions during the implementation of the TA and upon its completion. The Donor \nwill be responsible for its own costs with respect to any participation in TA review missions. ADB \nwill also provide the Donor the following reports in relation to the TA: (i) quarterly progress reports \non the implementation of the project; (ii) final report on the implementation of the project (which \nincludes the cofinanced activity) within 2 weeks of ADB\u2019s receipt. \n \nE.
