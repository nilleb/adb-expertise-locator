The transaction technical assistance (TA) facility will provide preparation support to four \nensuing projects in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): (i) Guangxi Wuzhou Healthy City \nDevelopment Program; (ii) Jilin Songhua Lake Ecological and Environmental Improvement; \n(iii) Shaanxi Xi\u2019an Preschool Education Quality Improvement; and (iv) Shandong Jining Water \nSupply and Drainage Integration. The ensuing projects will be investments in urban services, \ngreen infrastructure, environmental improvement, and human capital development; these are well \naligned  with  operational  and  strategic  priorities  of  both  the  government  and  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB).1 The ensuing projects, all in the urban and social sectors, will require \na similar set of safeguards, financial management, and economic assessments. This transaction \nTA facility is listed in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for the PRC, 2019\u20132021.2  \n \n2.  A strong track record of economic growth and poverty reduction has significantly improved \nquality of life in the PRC, but considerable economic, social, environmental, and institutional \nchallenges  pose  obstacles  to  further  inclusive  and  sustainable  development.  ADB  support \ncombines finance, knowledge, and partnerships to maximize development impact. In the PRC, \nADB promotes innovative demonstration projects, knowledge sharing, institutional reform efforts, \nand private sector participation. The government looks to ADB to introduce innovative approaches, \ntechnology, and policies. Local governments prepare initial project proposals with the support of \ndesign institutes, but current country systems still need support for economic and financial due \ndiligence\u2014especially economic analysis and financial management assessment\u2014environment \nand social safeguards due diligence, and sector assessments including sector governance.3 \n \n3.  Project preparation activities in the PRC include (i) reviewing the feasibility study reports \nprepared by design institutes; (ii) conducting economic and financial due diligence and assessing \nprocurement capacity; (iii) undertaking safeguards due diligence; (iv) analyzing poverty, social, \nand gender issues; and (v) preparing standard ADB documents and other requirements. Domestic \ncapacity in engineering design is of a high standard so ADB-financed project preparation activities \nwill not duplicate such efforts. With the aim of increasing efficiency, preparing projects faster, \nimproving  project  readiness,  and  strengthening  responsiveness  to  government  priorities, \ntransaction TA facilities allow ADB to engage experts to work on multiple projects. The TA facility \nwill also support exploration of innovative financing modalities and approaches, including results-\nbased lending, during the development of the ensuing projects. \n \n4.  The ensuing projects. The proposed ensuing projects are aligned with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020 and several of ADB Strategy 2030 operational \npriorities:  addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities;  accelerating  progress  in \ngender equality; tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing \nenvironmental sustainability; and making cities more livable (footnote 1). All ensuing projects will \nstrive for the effective gender mainstreaming category or higher. The TA facility is classified as \n                                                \n1 ADB. 2016.

Guangxi Wuzhou Healthy City Development Program. The proposed results-based \nlending (RBL) program will transform Wuzhou in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region into \nan integrated and inclusive city. The program will reflect Strategy 2030\u2019s emphasis on cross-\nsectoral support to address complex development challenges and will adopt the healthy city \napproach anchored in the Healthy China 2030 plan.4 It will support (i) clean urban environment \nand infrastructure, (ii) improved quality of health services for urban residents including the elderly, \n(iii) health sector human resource development, (iv) healthy lifestyles, and (v) stronger and more \nintegrated  urban  planning  and  governance.  Digital  technology  will  be  introduced  for  city \nmanagement and social services. The program is expected to have a strong demonstration effect \nboth within the PRC and in the region. The risk category is low because the loan amount does \nnot exceed $200 million and safeguard categorization is other than A.  \n \n6.  Jilin Songhua Lake Integrated Ecological and Environmental Improvement. The \nproposed project will improve ecological and environmental protection and management in \nSonghua Lake Area in Jilin City. This will be achieved through an integrated approach to (i) restore \nand protect the ecology in Songhua Lake and 12 rivers running into the lake; (ii) comprehensively \nmanage pollution sources in towns and villages in the Songhua Lake Area through investment in \nwastewater, sanitation, and domestic and agriculture solid waste management infrastructure and \nservices; (iii) control agriculture nonpoint source pollution in Songhua Lake Area by introducing \ncultivation modality with stronger soil stabilization capacity, reduced use of farm chemicals, and \nhigher production value; and (iv) improve rural livelihood through business development service \nlinked with environment protection. The project will also strengthen the city government\u2019s capacity \nin environmental management with innovations such as comprehensive environmental monitoring \nand management system in Songhua Lake Area and researches supporting future environmental \nand ecological protection plan for Songhua Lake. The risk category is complex because safeguard \ncategorization for environment is expected to be A.  \n \n7.  Shaanxi  Xi\u2019an  Preschool  Education  Quality  Improvement.  To  strengthen  human \ncapital, the proposed RBL program will increase access to high quality and inclusive early \nchildhood education (ECE) by constructing new kindergartens, upgrading existing ones, and \ncreating an enabling environment for the recruitment and retention of teachers in Xi\u2019an City. It will \n(i) construct, upgrade, and equip modern and inclusive kindergarten facilities; (ii) build capacity \nthrough  pre-  and  in-service  kindergarten teacher  training  using  innovative  methods  and  in \npartnership with local teacher training universities; and (iii) support research and pilot activities to \ninform and strengthen ECE in the PRC and beyond, including information and communication \ntechnology platforms for early childhood learning. The program will be aligned with the ambitious \n                                                \n4 Government of the PRC, State Council. 2016. The Healthy China 2030.

Shandong Jining Water Supply and Drainage Integration. The proposed project will \ncontribute  to  enhanced  livability  in  Jiaxiang  County  in  Jining  City,  Shandong  Province  by \nimproving water supply and sanitation infrastructure and delivering sustainable services. The \nproject will expand the water supply network and sewage collection and treatment systems, and \nintroduce appropriate innovations. The project will ensure the safety of potable water, protect the \nrural environment, and promote rural vitalization. It will also include capacity building for project \nimplementation and systems operations and maintenance. The risk categorization is complex \nbecause safeguard categorization for both environment and involuntary resettlement is expected \nto be A. \n  \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n9.
