During the visit of a Bank Reconnaissance Mission to Burma in May 1987,\nthe Government requested project preparatory technical assistance from the Bank\nfor the Oil and Gas Developnent Project. The Government subsequently reiterated\nits request for technical assistance to a Country Consultation Mission during its\nvisit to Burma in August 1987.  Fact-Finding Mission visited Burma in October\nA \n1987 to prepare the technical assistance proposal. Detailed discussions were held\nby the Mission with the Energy Planning Department (EPD) of the Ministry of Energy\n()E), the Myanma Oil Corporation (MOC), the Petrochemical Industries Corporation\n(PlC), the Petroleum Products Supply Corporation (PPSC), and the United Nations\nDevelopnent Program (UNDP), Rangoon, and agreement was reached with MOC and EPD on\nthe scope and terms of reference of the proposed technical assistance. UNDP,\nRangoon, has also agreed in principle to co-finance the technical assistance with\nthe Bank. The technical assistance was first listed in the Bank's Operational\nInformation on Proposed Projects in September 1987.\nII.\nA. Energy Sector\n2. Burma's domestic energy resources are characterized by sizeable reserves\nof oil and natural gas, substantial hydropower and some sub-bituminous coal. At\npresent, it is estimated that only about 14 per cent of the total energy\nrequirements in the country are met by commercial energy supply with the rest\nbeing met from traditional sources of energy such as fuelwood, charcoal and other\nbiomass residues. Oil, currently the largest commercial energy source of the\ncountry, provided about 42 per cent of the total primary commercial energy supply\nin FY1986/87. As sources of primary commercial energy supply for the country, oil\nis followed by natural gas (37 per cent), hydropower (20 per cent), and coal (1\nper cent). Per capita consumption of commercial energy in Burma during FY1986/87,\nestimated at 0.07 tons of oil equivalent (TOE), was much lower than the average\nper capita energy consumption, of about 0.37 TOE, in the Bank's developing member\ncountries. In the past, commercial energy in Burma was supplied almost entirely\nfrom domestic resources, with a small amount of imported coal. The Government's\npast policy was to rely entirely on local production of commercial energy to meet\ncoufltry \nthe  s needs.\n3. Despite Burma's abundant energy resources, local production of\ncommercial energy is below realizable potential and very much short of demand with\nthe result that there is a high level of suppressed demand particularly for oil\nproducts, which are administratively allocated. The commercial energy supply and\ndemand gap is expected to widen substantially in the coming years unless ininediate\naction is taken to increase domestic commercial energy supply and to supplement it\nwith imported energy. The scarcity of commercial energy supply, particularly\nliquid fuels, is at present severely constraining economic growth. As an interim\nmeasure, the Government is now considering the importation of crude oil for\nrefining in the local refineries so as to increase the supply of oil products to\nreduce the critical shortages of such products in the country. Importation of\ncrude oil will also help Burma improve the capacity utilization of its refineries\nand lower its refining costs.\n4. In 1984, a team from the World Bank and the Bank carried out a joint\nreview of the issues and options in the energy sector in Burma under the Energy\nDisclaimer : the PDF file attachment may not contain the complete text index.

A number of issues\nwere identified and presented in the report entitled \"Burma: Issues and Options\nin the Energy Sector\" for the Government to take action toward increasing domestic\ncoounercial energy supply. This proposed technical assistance study forms part of\nthe Government's overall effort directed toward achieving that goal.\nB. Oil and Gas Subsectors\n1. Reserves and Production\n(a) Reserves\n(i) Oil Reserves\n5. Burma has a long history of oil exploration, dating back to 1887 when\nthe Burma Oil Company made its first discovery at Yenangyaung. Up till now, 20\noil fields have been discovered, mainly in central Burma and in the Upper Delta\nBasin. The oil in-place reserves including condensates are estimated at 2 billion\nbarrels, of which 30 per cent are proven. More than half of these reserves are,\nhowever, highly waxy with low recovery rates. These reserves are equivalent to\nmore than 200 years of supply at the current rates of production.\n(ii) Gas Reserves\n6. Most of the non-associated gas reserves are located in southern Burma,\nsome of which are located offshore. Associated gas reserves are found in\noil-bearing reservoirs in central Burma and the Upper Delta Basin. Total gas\nreserves are estimated at 13.5 trillion cubic feet (TCF), of which two-thirds are\nproven and about 7 TCF of reserves are located offshore in the Gulf of Martaban.\nPresent gas consumption is very low at 0.5 per cent of the total reserves per\nyear.\n(b) Production\n(i) a\n7. Despite its large reserves, oil production over the past several years\nwas low and had declined. Total crude oil production fluctuates considerably,\nreaching a high of 11.2 million barrels (r4lB) in FY1984/85 but averaging an\noverall 8.6 per cent per annum decline since then to 8.3 MMB in FY1986/87, with\nthe rate of decrease accelerating to 19 per cent in FY1986/87. The geology of\nBurma's oil fields is complex. Many of the fields are affected by major and minor\nfaults, which result in the formation of different oil pools of varying size in\neach field. To complicate matters further, the majority of the reservoir rocks\nare interbedded with shale and the crude oils produced are waxy, causing blockage\nor reduction in fluid flow during oil production. Because of these factors, the\nmaintenance of a given output from an oil field in Burma requires continuous\ninvestments in servicing existing wells, in drilling new wells and in installing\nsecondary and enhanced recovery facilities so as to allow the oil to be extracted\nefficiently. The fall in oil production in Burma over the past several years\ncould be attributed to: (i) under-investment in the workover of existing wells\nand drilling of new wells, some of which would be needed to replace those wells\nwhich have suffered declining production; (ii) detrimental operational policies\nwhich have focused more on exploration to the detriment of field production; and\nDisclaimer : the PDF file attachment may not contain the complete text index.

The decline in oil production has caused the country to\nsuffer from serious energy shortages. The Government, however, is now taking\naction by way of: (1) the enhanced oil recovery study for two oil fields, Cha1c\nand Tetma, financed by UNDP under the World Bank-financed Gas Development and\nUtilization Project;!j and (ii) the proposed technical assistance study for\nrehabilitating and further developing the Mann and lltaukshabin fields arid the\nensuing Project to reverse the trend of falling crude oil production and to\nprevent the oil suppiy shortages from getting worse.\n(ii) Gas\n8. Gas production in Burma to date has been mainly in the form of\nassociated gas, which at present forms about 70 per cent of the total amount of\ngas produced in Burma. The remaining 30 per cent was produced as free gas by the\nonshore Payagon gas field. Gas production over the past five years has increased\nby 15 per cent a year from 23 billion cubic feet (BCF) in FY1982/83 to 40 BCF in\nFY1986/87. Present Government efforts are directed toward increasing gas supply\nfor use by power and industrial plants and households. In this connection, the\nGovernment is now implementing the World Bank-financed Gas Development and\nUtilization Project to increase gas supply from the Payagon field and to transmit\nthe gas to major consuming areas in Pangoon and elsewhere.\n2. Pricing\n(a)\n9. Present petroleum product end-consumer prices were fixed in 1982 and\nhave not been adjusted since then. These prices, however, include a high\ncommodity tax of about 40 per cent \u2022 At present, the end-consumer prices of\ngasoline, kerosene, diesel and fuel oil are respectively about 120 per cent, 70\nper cent, 65 per cent and 70 per cent of their equivalent international prices.\nCurrent welihead prices of oil at $6.6 per barrel are low and inadequate to allow\nthe producer, )C, to reinvest adequately in drilling and maintenance of the oil\nfields as needed for maintaining oil production from the existing fields at an\nadequate level. Part of the proposed technical assistance study will determine\nthe full costs of oil production from the two largest oil fields in Burma, the\nMann and Htaukshabin fields, refining and distribution so as to guide the\nGovernment in setting appropriate prices for the producer, JC, the refiner, PlC,\nand the distributor, PPSC. The Government is aware of the deficiencies of the\npresent oil pricing structure and the need to revise oil prices upwards. The\nGovernment has indicated to the Bank its intention to increase oil prices to\nlevels which will enable all the petroleum sector companies to recover their full\ncosts and to accumulate adequate reserves to overcome the present problem of\nunder-investment in the sector.\nA loan of $63 million equivalent was approved by the World Bank in\nJuly 1987.\nDisclaimer : the PDF file attachment may not contain the complete text index.

The existing gas tariff is low. It was originally set in the mid-1970s\nto reflect only the incremental production costs of separating associated gas,\nwhich is a by-product in the production of crude oil. For free gas produced from\nthe Payagon field, however, the Government has agreed in 1987 with the World Bank\nunder the Gas Development and Utilization Project to raise gas prices from the\nPayagon field to a level which would enable MOC to cover the long-run marginal\ncosts of production, transmission arid distribution. Under the agreement reached\nby the Government with the World Bank, the Government in April 1987 increased the\nprice of Payagon gas from K2.0 per thousand cubic feet (F) to K7.5 per MCF. The\nGovernment also undertook to further raise the price of Payagon gas to K8. 5 per\nMOF when the World Bank-financed Gas Development and Utilization Project comes on\nstream in 1990. Part of the proposed technical assistance study will also\ndetermine the long-run marginal cost of associated gas production, transmission\nand distribution from the Mann and Htaukshabin fields.\n3. Myanma Oil Corporation\n11. MOC, a wholly Government-owned corporation, was established in 1963,\nunder the supervision of the Ministry of Mines to take over the functions of\npetroleum exploration, development, production and marketing of oil and natural\ngas in Burma. In 1977, MOC was transferred to the Ministry of Industry No. 2 and\nin 1985 to MOE, which currently supervises its operations. MOC operates under a\n1976 charter which gives it adequate financial autonomy, authority to hire and\ndismiss employees and prescribe wage rates, and revise prices of oil and gas. Its\ncharter also stipulates that MOC should be run along commercial lines. MOC is run\nby a Board of Directors, which is chaired by its Managing Director and includes\nfive representatives from its management and two from its staff. Its Board is\ndirectly responsible to MDE. It is organized into eight departments, each headed\nby a Director, for planning, exploration, drilling, engineering, field operations,\nadministration, finance and offshore operations. Its present organizational\nset-up is shown in Appendix 1. As part of the former Burmah Oil Company and since\nindependence, MOC has over 40 years of experience in drilling and in management of\noil and gas fields. Its organization is staffed with a competent top level\nmanagement. Many of its managers arid senior executives have received training\nabroad under various bilateral training schemes. With such overseas and many\nyears of on-the-job training, many of MOC's staff especially at the middle\nmanagement level have become reasonably competent in their own fields of\nexpertise. For the past several years, MOC has been operating at a loss as it was\nnot able to generate sufficient revenues to cover its operating costs because of\nlow oil and gas prices. Under the World Bank-financed Gas Development and\nUtilization Project, the Government has agreed with the World Bank: (i) to carry\nout a study to identify measures to improve MOC's financial viability;  and (ii) to\nconsider implementation of the reconmiended measures to move MOC into financial\nself-reliance as soon as possible.\n4 \u2022 Government's Develonent Strategy\n12. Faced with ever worsening export earnings under the Fifth Four-Year Plan\n(FY1986/87-FY1989/90), the Government is now reviewing its overall development\nstrategy so as to ease the pressures on imports, investment and growth.\nConsequently, the Government's development strategy for the petroleum sector, a\nkey sector in the economy of Burma, is directed toward giving priority to projects\nDisclaimer : the PDF file attachment may not contain the complete text index.

This\ndevelorinent strategy is generally in line with the recommendations of the Energy\nSector Assessment Study prepared jointly by the World Bank and the Bank in 1984.\nThe Project ensuing from the proposed technical assistance would have such\ncharacteristics. The Project would essentially involve rehabilitation and\ndrilling works at the existing producing Mann and Htaukshabin fields and would be\nconsistent with the Government's strategy for the petroleum sector which is aimed\nat rehabilitating existing facilities and installing additional facilities to\nenable a fuller utilization of existing assets.\n5. Bank's Operational Strategy for Burma\n13. In view of the present critical need for Burma to increase its domestic\ncommercial energy supply so as to enable the economy to recover and grow in the\nfuture, the Bank can play a vital role in helping to rehabilitate Burma's oil and\ngas industries. In the short term, Bank support to Burma for boosting recovery\nrates from existing oil and gas producing fields through the repair of existing\nwells and other production facilities, drilling of new wells, installation of new\nsurface and sub-surface facilitiesjJ and expansion of oil and gas pipeline\nnetworks would be appropriate. Bank involvement in these areas would enable the\nBank to continue its efforts to promote policy reforms in the energy sector, which\nstarted when the Bank approved an advisory technical assistanceJfor the\ninstitutional stregnthenign of !13E. The Bank's past assistance to Burma for the\noil and gas sectors was for the provision of a program loan for the rehabilitation\nof the Chauk and Syriam refineriea./\nC. Project Area\n14. Both the Mann and Htaukshabin fields are located in central Burma (see\nMap 1). The Mann field is located at the northern end of the Minbu anticline4J\nwhile the Htaukshabin field is located at the southern end of the same anticline.\nBoth fields are characterized by a large number of reservoir layers and the\npresence of cross faults that divide their structures into different fault blocks,\nresulting in the occurrence of many different oil pools in each field. Apart from\nthe presence of faults in both fields, their reservoir rocks are also interbedded\nwith shale layers, which create difficulties during drilling and in the extraction\nof oil from these two fields. Because of the geologic complexities of the\nreservoirs, extraction of oil from them would require the drilling of a large\nnumber of wells to drain the oil from the different reservoirs. Further, because\n] Such facilities include oil and gas gathering lines, sucker rods,\nproduction tubing, pumps, lift equipnent, and wellhead,\ncompression, water flooding, gas processing and other facilities.\n/ TA No. 886 for Institutional Strengthening within the Ministry of\nEnergy approved on 29 June 1987.\nJ Loan No. 491-BUR(SF) for $5.0 million for the Petroleum Refining\nIndustry Program approved by the Bank on 11 December 1980.\nThe upward geological fold in rock strata in which the beds or\n4J \nlayers dip in opposite direction from the crest, permitting\npossible entrapnent of oil nd gas against impermeable cap rocks.\nDisclaimer : the PDF file attachment may not contain the complete text index.

As a result, although some limited primary\nrecovery of oil through the initial expansion of oil and gas can be achieved,\nwater and/or gas need to be injected into each reservoir, as part of the secondary\nrecovery phase, to support reservoir pressure and to move the oil to the producing\nwells. In these two fields, lift equipuent has to be installed to pump the oil out\nof the reservoirs during both the primary and secondary recovery phases. The last\nstage of oil extraction from these two fields, the tertiary recovery phase, would\ninvolve the use of enhanced recovery techniques such as thermal, chemical and\nother methods to extract some of the remaining oil in the reservoirs. At the\npresent stage of development, oil recovery from these two fields employs only a\ncombination of primary and secondary recovery techniques. The use of enhanced\nrecovery techniques to extract oil from the two fields will be needed in the\nlonger term.\n15. At present, the Ma in and the Htaukshabin fields are the largest oil\nproducing fields in Burma. The Mann field was discovered in 1970. Its production\nhas declined from 6.6 41B in FY1982/83 to 3.3 1+IB in FY1986/87. It is now\nproducing 7,300 barrels of oil a day from 257 wells out of 600 wells drilled. The\ndepths of these wells vary from 1,000 ft to 7,000 ft. The Htaukshabin field was\ndiscovered in 1978. Its production has increased from 0.7 MMB in Ff1982183 to 3.7\n!4,IB in FY1985186 and declined to 3.1 lIMB in FY1986/87. It is now producing 5,000\nbarrels of oil a day from 360 wells out of 650 wells drilled. The depths of these\nwells vary from 1,000 ft to 5,000 ft. Crude oil produced from these two fields is\nprocessed in the nearby Mann refinery and in the Syriam refinery located at\nRangoon. Part of the crude oil production from these two fields is transferred to\nthe Syriant refinery by the 470 kin, 10-inch diameter Mann/Syriani crude oil transfer\npipeline. The refineries are at present operating at only 30 per cent of their\ntotal designed capacities because of the shortage of crude oil.\n16. Due to the shortage of foreign exchange resources, JC has not been\nable, since the early 1980s, to procure the necessary equipment, materials and\nspares to repair the drilling rigs, the existing wells and the surface and\nsub-surface facilities and to drill sufficient new wells so as to arrest the\ndecline in oil production. Several well servicing, workover and development\ndrillign rigs, although urgently required for servicing existing wells and\ndrilling new wells, are currently idle for lack of spares. Up to about 250\nwellsjJ in each field are either shut-in or producing below the level of their\nproduction potential because of the shortage of equipment and materials to\nrehabilitate them for efficient oil/gas production. The poor mechanical condition\nof many of the producing wells needs to be improved through the replacement of\ntheir production tubings, sucker rods J and pumps. Such improvements will lead\nto the reduction of the frequency of having to service the wells. Further, the\noil and gas gathering lines have to be upgraded with the installation of\nappropriate valves and lines so as to reduce back pressure on the producing wells\nso that oil can flow without undue hindrance to the crude oil storage tanks.

With regard to the\nMann/Syriarn crude oil pipeline, it was installed in 1974 with no cathodic\nprotection facilities. Consequently, due to the pipeline having to handle crude\noil containing saline water, the pipeline has suffered corrosion in several\nplaces. Thus there is a need to repair this line and to install cathodic\nprotection facilities to prevent further corrosion of this line.\n17. The Mann and Htaukshabin fields have the potential to produce much\nhigher levels of crude oil than at present. As at 1 April 1986, the Mann field\nhad proven reserves of 174 1?4B and the Htaukshabin field 317 41B. To arrest the\ndecline in oil production from the Mann and the Htaukshabin fields, an appropriate\nprogram has to be worked out to repair the existing wells, rehabilitate the\nexisting surface and sub-surface facilities including the associated Mann/Syriam\ncrude oil pipeline, drill new wells and install new surface and sub-surface\nfacilities. The work program will have to be prioritized and formulated on the\nbasis of giving priority th repair those existing wells which have the highest\nproduction potential and to drill new wells in those areas which have the largest\noil pools. The Government and MDC requested Bank assistance to formulate such a\nprogram. A suitable program covering a period of three years of rehabilitation\nand drilling works is expected to result in an additional averga e crude oil\nproduction of 1.5 million barrels a year from the two fields over a 20-year\nperiod. In addition, another 2 BCF of associated gas a year could be produced\nfrom the two fields over the same period. The rehabilitation and developiient\nprogram to be prepared under the proposed technical assistance will also help\nBurma improve the capacity utilization of its refineries, particularly the Syriaxn\nrefinery which had been rehabilitated under the Bank-financed Petroleum Refining\nIndustry Program. Shortage of crude oil supply is a major factor which is\naffecting adversely the performance of this and other refineries in Burma.\nIII. ThE HJRJS TE11NICAL ASSIA1XE\nA. Objectives\n18. The objectives of the technical assistance are to carry out a study to\nrehabilitate and further develop the Mann and Htaukshabin oil/gas fields and to\ndetermine the full financial and economic costs of oil and gas production from\nthese two fields, the delivery of oil to the refineries, the refining and\ndistribution of oil in Burma and the transmission and distribution of gas from\nthese two fields. The study will prepare a three-year field rehabilitation and\ndeveloj.uient program covering production of oil and gas, repair of well servicing,\nworkover and developnent drilling rigs, repair of existing wells, surface and\nsub-surface facilities and the associated Mann/Syriam pipeline, drilling of new\nwells, and installation of new surface and sub-surface facilities. The proposed\ntechnical assistance is consistent with the Government's policy of developing its\nindigenous oil and gas resources to help improve the local availability of\ncommercial energy to arrest the growing shortages of oil, to increase gas\nproduction and to spur economic growth.\nDisclaimer : the PDF file attachment may not contain the complete text index.
