It will contribute to the economic \nintegration of selected rural communities, which make up about 10% of \nthe total rural population, by improving high-priority rural feeder roads \ntotaling  about  220  kilometers  (km)  connected  to  the  national  road \nnetwork.  It  will  also  strengthen  transport  sector  management.  The \nproposed  supplementary  loan  will  finance  cost  overruns  for  the \nconstruction of rural feeder roads. \n   \nRationale  The Government of Armenia is committed to the development of road \ntransport, which currently services 98% of passenger traffic and 66% of \nfreight traffic. The Project is a Government priority and will improve the \nsocioeconomic conditions of the rural population by rehabilitating rural \nroads in line with the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy paper.\nThe Project will also help the Government to meet its plans to complete \nthe rehabilitation of secondary roads and bridges by 2015.  \n \nThe  Project  was  approved  on  28  September  2007  and  procurement \nactivities started in early 2008 as scheduled. The invitation for bid for \npackage 1 (10 lots totaling about 109 km) was issued on 23 April 2008 \nunder international competitive bidding procedures (single-stage, one-\nenvelope), following ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time) and standard bidding documents. On 6 June 2008, the \nbids were received by the Executing Agency and were evaluated. The bid \nevaluation report was submitted to ADB for approval on 24 June 2008. \nThe total bid amount for the 10 lots was about $23.57 million, 45% higher \nthan the cost estimated at appraisal in 2006. The contracts have been \nsigned and are under implementation. Package 2 (about 118 km) is being \nfinalized and will be ready for bidding at the end of October 2008.  \n \nThe Project would face further implementation delays if the cost overruns \nin the civil works components are not redressed soon. A sharp price \nescalation in material costs, the depreciation of the US dollar against the \nArmenian dram, and domestic inflation were the main factors contributing \n ", "ii   \nto the Project\u2019s cost overruns.  \n \nImpact and  The Project scope remains the same. The impact and outcome of the \nOutcome  proposed supplementary loan will be consistent with the Project. Its impact \nwill be an improvement in the income and non-income dimensions of \npoverty in rural areas in four project regions, serving about 10% of the \ncountry\u2019s total rural population. The outcome will be increased mobility \nand better access to basic social service delivery institutions, employment \nopportunities,  and  domestic  and international  markets  for  communities \nand enterprises in the four regions. The feeder roads improved under the \nProject will lead to (i) higher-quality and more frequent road transport \nservices; (ii) more business opportunities for the private sector in general, \nparticularly agriculture (including agro-processing), industry, and services; \nand (iii) benefits from close partnerships with other donors in the road and \nother sectors relevant to the Project.  \n \nRevised Project  The revised investment cost of the Project is estimated at $64.84 million \nInvestment Plan  equivalent, including taxes and duties, physical and price contingencies, \n  interest and other charges. \n   \nRevised Financing  Revised Project Financing Plan \nPlan  ($ million) \n  Amounts \n    Proposed     \nSource  Basea  Financing  Total  % \nAsian Development Bank  30.60  17.32  47.92  73.9 \nGovernment of Armenia  10.80  6.12  16.92  26.1 \nTotal  41.40  23.44  64.84  100.0 \na  Base = as stated in Asian Development Bank. 2007.

Manila  (Loan  2351-ARM, \napproved on 28 September). \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nIt is proposed that ADB provide a loan in various currencies equivalent to \nSpecial Drawing Rights 11,201,000 ($17.32 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources. The loan will have a 31-year term, including a \ngrace period of 7 years, an interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the \ngrace period, and 1.5% per annum thereafter. As the original loan and \nproposed  supplementary  loan  are  from  the  Asian  Development  Fund \n(ADF),  repayments  of  the  proposed  supplementary  loan  will  be \nsynchronized with those of the original loan. \n \nAs part of the performance-based allocations for ADF, Armenia is able to \navail  of  additional  ADF  resources  in  the  amount  of  SDR11,201,000 \n($17.32  million  equivalent).  The  Government  has  requested  ADB  to \nprovide additional resources to finance the increased costs of the original \nproject scope. As the Project is a Government priority, there is a strong \njustification for the proposed supplementary loan. \n \n \n ", "  iii\nPeriod of  Until 30 June 2011 \nUtilization \n   \nEstimated  Project  31 December 2010 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Transport and Communications (the Executing Agency for the \nRural Road Sector Project). \n   \nImplementation  The  Armenian  Roads  Directorate  is  the  Implementing  Agency. \nArrangements  The existing project management unit is providing support for the day-to-\nday coordination and implementation of the Project. \n \nProcurement  The  existing  procurement  plan  was  updated  with  the  revised  contract \nvalues. The ADB-financed contracts (package 2) under the Project will be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. Package 2 \n(civil works contracts) will be carried out by using international competitive \nbidding procedures and the post-qualification method as described in the \nprocurement plan for the original project. \n \nAdvance  There is no need for advance contracting or retroactive financing. \nContracting and \nRetroactive \nFinancing \n \nConsulting  The negotiation for the construction supervision consultant\u2019s contract took \nServices  place in April 2008. The supervision consulting contract approved by the \nGovernment funded by the original loan covers all necessary tasks and \ngoals  of  supervision.  Therefore,  no  supplementary  consulting  services \n(known  in  Armenia  as  \u2018\u2019supervision  by  the  author\u2019\u2019)  are  needed  or \nenvisaged under the proposed supplementary loan. \n \nProject Benefits  The Project will provide long-term sustainable savings in vehicle operating \nand Beneficiaries  costs  and  travel  time  stemming  from  the  physical  improvements,  and \ndevelopment of improved transport and road management systems in the \nrural areas covering four regions. \n \nRisks and  The  major  risks  identified  in  the  original  loan  (project  implementation \nAssumptions  delays and low quality of works) still apply to the proposed supplementary \nloan.  The  ongoing  packages  are  experiencing  implementation  delays \nbecause  of  the  Project\u2019s  cost  overruns  and  the  prolonged  approval \nprocess for contracts by the Government. The proposed supplementary \nloan will help expedite the implementation of the Project. However, if \nthere are any further increase in prices of commodities, the Government \nmight  reduce  some  subprojects  through  a  change  in  scope,  or  will \nfinance the additional cost from its own resources. \n \n ", "44 o 00'E 46 o 00'E\nREPUBLIC OF ARMENIA\nRURAL ROAD SECTOR PROJECT\nG E O R G I A\nTashir Alaverdi Debed R.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nsupplementary loan to Armenia for the Rural Road Sector Project. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  THE APPROVED PROJECT \nA.  Project Rationale \n2.  In response to the challenges created by deficiencies in the road infrastructure, the \nGovernment of Armenia has developed a road policy to 2015, focusing on rehabilitation and \nmaintenance of existing roads in line with the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy paper \n(PRSP).1 The Government adopted three strategic goals for road infrastructure development for \n2006\u20132015:  (i)  maintenance  and  improvement  of  the  main  road  network  to  enhance  the \ncountry\u2019s  business  competitiveness  and  support  the  economy,  (ii)  improvement  to  the \nsocioeconomic conditions of the rural population through the rehabilitation of rural roads, and \n(iii) improvement to traffic safety. The Government plans to (i) complete the rehabilitation of old \nbridges  and  other  ancillary  facilities  along  the  main  highways  by  2010,  (ii)  complete  the \nrehabilitation of secondary roads and bridges by 2015, (iii) meet rural road transport demands in \na cost-effective manner, and (iv) ensure road safety throughout all road categories. \n \n3.  Inefficient infrastructure is one of the main causes of poverty, so rural infrastructure \ndevelopment  is  a  cornerstone  of  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  paper.  The \nGovernment has also prepared a rural infrastructure investment program. With World Bank \nassistance, the Government launched a Lifeline Road Network Program (LRNP) in 2004 to \nimprove the access of rural communities to the national highway system throughout the country. \nThe Project targets improving 784 high-priority rural feeder roads (secondary and local roads) \ntotaling about 2,700 kilometers (km). The Project is a Government priority.  \n \nB.  Objectives and Scope \n4.  In July 2007, the Government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) reached an \nagreement  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan,  and \nimplementation arrangements of the Rural Road Sector Project (the Project) and on the original \nloan for the Project.2  The Project will upgrade up to about 220 km of high-priority asphalt \nconcrete roads. The main project outcome will be increased mobility and more access to basic \nsocial  services,  employment  opportunities,  and  domestic  and  international  markets  for \ncommunities and enterprises in rural and urban areas of the four regions. The Project consists \nof (i) a road connectivity improvement component; and (ii) a road infrastructure management \ncomponent, comprising (a) road design, subproject preparation, and construction supervision; \nand (b) project management. The feeder roads improved under the Project will lead to (i) higher-\nquality and more frequent road transport services; (ii) more business opportunities for the \nprivate sector, particularly agriculture (including agro-processing), industry, and services; and \n(iii) benefits from close partnerships with other donors in the road and other sectors relevant to \nthe Project.  \n \n \n                                                 \n1  World Bank \u2013 Yerevan. 2003.

On  28  September  2007,  ADB  approved  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSpecial Drawing Rights 20.075 million ($30.6 million equivalent) from Special Funds resources \nto help finance the Project. The Loan Agreement was signed on 15 November 2007 and \nbecame  effective  on  7  March  2008,  with  an  original  closing  date  of  30  June  2011. \nThe Government will finance the remaining project cost of $10.8 million equivalent.

Status and Progress of Project Implementation \n7.  The Project is being implemented largely as scheduled. The project management unit \n(PMU) in the Executing Agency, the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC), has \nbeen established and is fully operational. Procurement started in early 2008. The invitation for \nbid  for  package  1  (10  lots  totaling  about  109  km)  was  issued  on  23  April  2008  under \ninternational  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures  (single-stage,  one-envelope),  following \n ", "  3\nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007 as amended from time to time) and standard bidding \ndocuments. On 6 June 2008, the bids were received by the Executing Agency and were \nevaluated. The bid evaluation report was submitted to ADB for approval on 24 June 2008. The \ntotal bid amount for the 10 lots was about $23.57 million, 45% higher than the cost estimated at \nappraisal in 2006. The contracts have been signed and are being implemented. Package 2 (13 \nlots totaling about 118 km) is being finalized and will be ready for bidding at the end of October \n2008.  The  contract  negotiation  for  the  construction  supervision  consultant  (for  subproject \npreparation  including  design  and  technical,  environmental,  economic,  and  social  and \nresettlement due diligence) took place in April 2008. The contract has been approved by the \nGovernment and is being funded by the original loan. The consultant has commenced its \nservices. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY LOAN \nA.  Cost Overruns \n8.  The proposed supplementary loan will finance the increase in the project costs resulting \nfrom (i) price increases; (ii) domestic inflation; and (iii) the appreciation of the Armenian dram \n(see Appendix 2). \n \n9.  The total bid amount for package 1 (10 lots) is about $23.57 million, 45% higher than the \ncost estimated at appraisal in 2006 and about 1.1% less than the revised cost estimate made in \nFebruary 2008. Package 2 (13 lots totaling about 118 km) is being finalized and is expected to \nbe ready for bidding at the end of October 2008. As of 9 July 2008, the first cost estimate was \n98% higher than that at appraisal, principally because of increases in the cost of raw materials \nand oil. The cost estimate will be reassessed and known before package 2 bidding process \nstarts. Details of packages 1 and 2 are given in Appendix 3. Since appraisal (December 2006) \nthe cost of the following items has increased substantially: (i) bitumen by 41%, (ii) aggregate \nstones by 55%, (iii) diesel and fuel by 81%, (iv) reinforcing steel by 111%, (v) cement by 36%, \nand (vi) labor per man-hour by 91%. \n \n10.  The  increase  in  project  costs  has  also  resulted  from  domestic  inflation  and  an \nappreciation of the Armenian dram. Inflation is expected to grow to over 6% in 2008, compared \nwith 4.4% in 2007. As of the time of writing, the annual average inflation rate was 9%. The dram \nhas appreciated by about 16% since December 2006 (the time of appraisal), from AMD364.84 \nto $1 to AMD307.13 to $1 in May 2008. \n \nB.  Impact on the Project \n11.  The cost overruns have posed a major risk to the timely and successful completion of \nthe Project. The proposed supplementary loan will support the achievement of the original \nproject objectives, outcomes, and main outputs, which are to rehabilitate about 220 km of \nrural roads.  \n \nC.  Rationale \n12.  The  proposed  supplementary  loan  is  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  for \nsupplementary  financing.3 The  proposed  supplementary  loan  is  to  cover  the  project  cost \noverrun. The Project is in line with the Government priority to improve the socioeconomic \n                                                 \n3 ADB. 2005.

Manila \n(R303-05, 7 November). \n ", "4   \nconditions of the rural population by rehabilitating rural roads in line with its poverty reduction \nstrategy  paper.  The  Project  will  support  the  Government  to  complete  the  rehabilitation  of \nsecondary roads and bridges by 2015. However, the cost overrun has jeopardized the Project, \nincreasing the risk of delays in implementation. This is a strong need for ADB to provide \nsupplementary financial assistance to the Government to ensure that the Project is completed \non time and successfully. \n \n13.  MOTC (the Executing Agency), and the Armenian Roads Directorate4 (the Implementing \nAgency) are in place and fully operational. Package 1 was procured through ICB procedures \nwith post-qualification, as described in the Project\u2019s procurement plan. The contracts have been \nsigned and implementation has started. The supervision consultant has commenced its services. \nThe ongoing activities are in compliance with ADB\u2019s safeguards requirements. \n \nD.  Revised Cost Estimate \n14.  The revised project cost is estimated at $64.84 million, including taxes and duties, \nphysical and price contingencies, interest and other charges. This is an increase of 56.6% over \nthe original cost estimate. The revised project investment plan is in Table 3.

The  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  a  supplementary  loan5 in  various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR11,201,000 ($17.32 million equivalent), from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources. The loan will have a 31-year term, including a grace period of 7 years, an interest \ncharge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period, and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The \nGovernment will provide $6.12 million equivalent in counterpart funds. As the original loan and \nproposed supplementary loan are from the Asian Development Fund (ADF), repayments of the \nproposed supplementary loan will be synchronized with those of the original loan. The total \nfinancing percentages are the same as those in the original loan. The revised project financing \nplan is in Table 4. \n                                                 \n4  A  noncommercial  state  organization  responsible  for  planning  and  management  of  road  construction  and \nmaintenance work for the road assets under MOTC\u2019s purview. \n5 As part of the performance-based allocations for the Asian Development Fund, Armenia is able to avail of \nadditional ADF resources in the amount of SDR11.201 million (about $17.32 million equivalent). \n ", "  5\nTable 4: Revised Project Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \n  Amounts   \nSource  Basea  Sup  Total  % \nAsian Development Bank  30.60  17.32  47.92  73.9 \nGovernment of Armeniab  10.80  6.12  16.92  26.1 \nTotal  41.40  23.44  64.84  100.0 \nBase = original loan, Sup = Supplementary loan. \na  ADB. 2007.

However if there are any further increases in prices \nof commodities, the Government might reduce some subprojects through a change in scope \nor finance the cost increase.  \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n17.  As for the original loan, MOTC is the Executing Agency and Armenian Roads Directorate \n(ARD) is the Implementing Agency responsible for planning, implementation, and supervision of \nthe Project. Within ARD, a PMU has been established to manage the day-to-day coordination, \nimplementation, and administration of the Project, including (i) selection and assessment of \nsubprojects, (ii) maintenance of project accounts, (iii) support for the procurement of equipment \nand materials, (iv) monitoring and reporting on subproject implementation, (v) facilitation of \nenvironmental  and  social  protection  measures,  (vi)  detailed  design  supervision,  and  (vii) \nconstruction supervision. The PMU will, on a quarterly basis or more often as required, meet \nwith  each  organization, 6 which  it  considers  appropriate,  to  discuss  and  coordinate  the \nimplementation of the Project. The PMU will further discuss all issues to be addressed with such \nother entities in accordance with the terms of the project administration memorandum agreed to \nbetween the Borrower and ADB. The PMU will be maintained until project completion.  \n \n18.  In  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  requirements  for  externally  funded  projects,7  \nMOTC is assisted by a project governing council (PGC). The PGC is an interministerial and \ninterdepartmental body consisting of representatives from the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of \nJustice, MOTC, Ministry of Territorial Administration, and civil society representatives of the \nproject beneficiaries. The PGC is chaired by the minister of MOTC. The PGC operates in \n                                                 \n6  Such as the Millennium Challenge Organization, the Lincy Foundation, ASIF (Armenia Social Investment Fund, \nfinanced by the World Bank), JICA [Japan International Cooperation Agency, concessional loan operations of \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) were integrated into the operations of Japan International Agency \n(JICA) on 1 October 2008], UNAIDS (Joined United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS), USAID (United States \nAgency for International Development), and UNDP (United Nations Development Programme). \n7  Armenia. 1999. On the Activities of Project Implementation with the Proceeds of Loans and Grants Provided to the \nRepublic of Armenia by Foreign States and International Lending Organizations. Resolution No. 765 dated 22 \nDecember 1999. Yerevan. \n ", "6   \naccordance with the Government\u2019s requirements (footnote 7) and is responsible for (i) guiding \nthe overall policy and strategic direction of the Project, (ii) reviewing and evaluating project and \nsubproject performance, and (iii) assisting with the coordination among other funding agency \nprojects relating to the project roads. The PGC will be maintained until project completion.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n19.  The Project will be implemented over 3 years, with an estimated project completion date \non 31 December 2010.  \n \n3.  Procurement \n20  Package 1 was procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines, using ADB \nstandard bidding documents under ICB procedures with post-qualification, as described in the \noriginal Project\u2019s procurement plan. Package 2 will be procured under the same procedures. \nThe procurement plan was revised because of increases in costs and a minor difference in \nlength8 (km) of certain rural roads (lots). The revised plan is in Appendix 5. \n \n21.  The Government currently imports bitumen required for road improvement from non-\nADB  member  countries.  Restricting  bitumen  procurement  to  ADB  member  countries  may \npreclude civil works contractors under the Project from obtaining the best economic terms, and \nmay seriously erode economic efficiency. The Board of Directors of ADB has approved the \nproposal that bitumen procured from non-member countries of ADB for civil works be eligible for \nfinancing under the Project during the consideration of the original loan. It is proposed that \nbitumen procured from non-member countries of ADB for civil works under the Project be also \neligible for financing from the proposed supplementary loan. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n22.  The supervision consultant was engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The consultant is funded under the \noriginal loan and has commenced its services. \n \n5.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n23.  Advance contracting and retroactive financing are not necessary under the proposed \nsupplementary loan. \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n24.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  including  the  Executing  Agency  and  the  Implementing  Agency  and \nincluded  in  the  bidding  documents.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project have included provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency, and all contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n                                                 \n8  Increases or decreases in length are due to the difference between the first designs (undertaken at time of \nappraisal) and the detailed final designs used for the bidding process and the implementation. \n ", "  7\n7.  Financial Management \n25.  ARD, which is responsible for the flow of funds, accounting, reporting, and auditing, is \nmanaging  project  finances.  ARD  has  acceptable  financial  management  arrangements:  \n(i) accounting and reporting are performed with the use of appropriate software, which supports \na reliable and flexible system of recording and reporting with the required details and formats;  \n(ii) the bookkeeping system allows systematic storing of all supporting financial documentation \nrelating to the Project; (iii) the internal control system is adequate; and (iv) accounting staff have \nextensive experience of World Bank procedures for disbursement and financial management \nunder  the  two  road  projects  financed  by  the  World  Bank,  including  financial  management \nreports.  \n \n8.  Disbursement Arrangements \n26.  There were four conditions for disbursements under the original loan. These have been \ncomplied  with.  The  proceeds  from  the  proposed  supplementary  loan  will  be  disbursed  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time) \nand in accordance with the arrangements for the original loan. ARD manages the imprest \naccount, which was opened at a bank9 acceptable to ADB and is exclusively used to finance \nADB\u2019s share of eligible expenditures as stipulated in the original loan. \n \n9.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n27.  ARD will submit quarterly and annual progress reports to ADB, through MOTC. These \nreports will indicate progress made and problems encountered during the review periods, steps \ntaken to remedy the problems or  proposed countermeasures, the proposed activities, and \nexpected progress during the following periods. Within 3 months of physical completion of the \nProject,  MOTC  will  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report  providing  details  on \nimplementation, costs, benefits, and other information that ADB may request. \n \n28.  ARD is maintaining separate accounts and financial statements for the Project, which \nwill be audited annually by international independent auditors acceptable to ADB. Auditors will \nbe selected and engaged by quality- and cost-based selection or the consultants\u2019 qualifications \nselection method, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Annual audit \nreports will include an opinion on the use of the loan proceeds and compliance with the financial \ncovenants included in the loan agreements, if any, including the use of imprest accounts and \nstatement of expenditures procedures. ARD will provide ADB with audit reports in English, \ntogether with audited accounts and financial statements, no later than 6 months after the end of \neach fiscal year. \n \n29.  The Government was informed of ADB\u2019s policy on submission of audited accounts, \nwhich  covers  failure  to  submit  audited  accounts  and  financial  statements  by  due  dates.  \nIf submission of a financial statement is delayed by more than 6 months (i) no commitment letter \nwill be issued, if applicable; and (ii) ADB may not approve new contact awards. If the delay is \nmore than 12 months, loan disbursements may be suspended or the loans may be canceled. \n \n10.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n30.  The  PMU,  assisted  by  the  consultant  for  subproject  preparation  and  construction \nsupervision, will establish a systematic project performance monitoring system to monitor and \n                                                 \n9  ARDSHININVESBANK \u201cCJSC\u201d, Yerevan Branch, 4 Vazgen Sargsyan St. 0010 Yerevan, Republic of Armenia. \n ", "8   \nevaluate  the  impacts,  outcomes,  outputs,  and  activities  in  relation  to  the  targets  and \nbenchmarks set for each subproject and the Project. \n \n11.  Stakeholder Participation and Consultations \n31.  MOTC and ARD have conducted public consultations with nongovernment organizations \nand local governments in the region of Armavir and in Yerevan, to which all others regions were \ninvited. The stakeholders involved in the consultations have expressed strong support for the \nproposed supplementary loan. \n \n12.  Project Reviews \n32.  In addition to regular reviews by ADB, a midterm review of project implementation will be \ncarried out during 2009. Representatives of ADB and the Government will take part in the \nreview,  which  is  designed  to  focus  on  impacts\u2014particularly  those  relating  to  institutional, \nadministrative,  organizational,  technical,  environmental,  and  social  aspects\u2014and  poverty \nreduction.  Other  parameters  that  might  negatively  affect  the  economic  viability  and  other \naspects of the Project will be assessed during the review, which will allow for any necessary \nmidterm adjustments. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic Benefits \n33.  The economic internal rates of return (EIRR) were recalculated for each rural road \nsubproject. Each subproject EIRR was subjected to a sensitivity analysis and risk analysis of \nkey adverse variables. Four subprojects (2 under package 1 and 2 under package 2) have \nEIRRs ranging from 4% to 8%. The subprojects under package 1 are committed. For package \n2, the concerned 2 subprojects will be closely reviewed on the basis of their economic viability.  \nThe combined EIRR was revised to 34% from the original estimated 43%. As a result, the \nProject\u2019s EIRR is highly robust, despite a large increase in the economic investment cost. This \nvalidates earlier sensitivity analyses under the original loan, which estimated ample switching \nvalues  required  to  reduce  the  Project\u2019s  net  present  value  to  zero.  The  revised  economic \nanalysis is in Appendix 6.  \n \nB.  Project Sustainability \n34.  The Government has increased road budgets and is committed to providing adequate \nfunds to maintain the roads after the improvements.  \n \nC.  Social and Poverty Impacts \n \n35.  The Project will improve income and non-income dimensions of poverty in rural areas. \nThe Project\u2019s impact on poverty has been quantified by examining the share of total project net \nbenefits that would accrue to the poor and the very poor. About 32% of road users within the \nproject areas are poor and 6% are classified very poor. Project benefits will accrue to about \n40,500 poor beneficiaries, of whom roughly 7,000 are very poor. A distribution analysis indicates \nthat the Project will yield a poverty impact ratio of 0.28. Total net benefits accruing to the poor in \nthe project areas are estimated to amount to about $24 million, of which the very poor will \nreceive about $4 million. Improved road infrastructure will provide rural communities with better \naccess to social service institutions, including hospitals, clinics, and schools. This will help to \naddress the non-income-related causes of poverty.  \n \n ", "  9\nD.  Indigenous People \n36.  An initial social assessment was carried out during project processing, covering all \npotential subprojects. A detailed socioeconomic evaluation of 15 communities10 was conducted \nand more than six consultation meetings were held in these communities. Extensive research \non the remaining project area was also conducted. The assessment concluded that there are no \nindigenous people living in the project area.  \n \nE.  Internally Displaced Persons and Refugees \n37.  A total of nearly 19,000 internally displaced persons and refugees (IDPRs) live in the \nproject area, which constitute about 15% of the total community population. Of 19,000 IDPRs, \nabout 18,000 are refugees, while the remainders are internally displaced persons. The Project \nwill  provide  the  IDPRs  with  better  access  to  markets,  job  opportunities,  and  basic  social \nservices. The IDPRs do not live near the road alignments, so there will be no negative impact \non the IDPRs during construction. Surveys carried out during project preparation concluded that \nnegative impacts on IDPRs will be limited. As the Project is funded by a sector loan, an \ninternally displaced persons and refugees\u2019 development framework has been prepared under \nthe original loan. The consulting services for subproject preparation and project supervision will \nreview potential negative impacts on IDPRs, and prepare specific actions and development \nplans, if necessary. \n \nF.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n38.  Rehabilitation work under the Project follows the existing carriageway widths, which are \nabout half of the right-of-way widths. No resettlement will be required even though the lengths of \nsome subprojects slightly decreased or increased when the detailed designs were finalized for \nthe bid documents for packages 1 and 2. It was concluded during the detailed design that there \nis no encroachment on the subprojects. Since this is a sector loan, a resettlement framework \nwas prepared at appraisal of the original loan. The resettlement framework is in Supplementary \nAppendix A. \n \nG.  Environmental Impacts  \n39.  The Project is category B and is expected to have insignificant environmental impacts \nduring both construction and operation stages, even if the length of some subprojects has \nslightly changed (para. 38). All the subprojects are more than 1 km from protected areas \n(national  parks  or  state  reserves).  No  ecological  or  biodiversity  impacts  are  expected. \nThe environmental assessment and review procedures included in an initial environmental \nexamination (IEE) covered the screening and selection process and criteria for packages 1 and \n2,  following  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines \n(2003). The environmental management plan (EMP) prepared under the IEE included mitigation \nmeasures, monitoring programs, and capacity-building programs. Environmental impact was \nassessed during subproject preparation, and will be monitored and evaluated during project \nimplementation. EMPs and IEEs have been prepared for the subprojects (packages 1 and 2) \nbased on the detailed designs and were included in the contract documents. This process will \nbe supported and monitored by the consulting firm for subproject preparation and construction \nsupervision.  \n \n                                                 \n10 The communities have a total population of about 25,820 persons (about 20% of the total people living within the \nproject areas) along four subprojects in Gegharkunik (road link no. 2), Ararat (road link no. 17), and Kotayk (road \nlink nos. 14 and 27). \n ", "10  \nH.  Risks \n40.  The major risks identified in the original loan (project implementation delays and low \nquality of works) still apply to the proposed supplementary loan. The ongoing packages are \nexperiencing implementation delays because of the Project\u2019s cost overruns and the prolonged \napproval process for contracts by the Government. The proposed supplementary loan will help \nexpedite the implementation of the Project. However, if there are any further increase in prices \nof commodities, the Government might reduce some subprojects through a change in scope, \nor will finance the additional cost from its own resources.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n41.  In  addition to  the standard  assurances,  the Government  has assured  its  continued \ncompliance with the covenants set forth in the Loan Agreement (Special Operations) dated 15 \nNovember 2007. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATIONS \n42.  I am satisfied that the proposed supplementary loan would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nsupplementary loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 11,201,000 to \nArmenia for the Rural Sector Road Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an \ninterest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter; a term of 31 years, including a grace period of 7 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement \npresented to the Board; and \n \n43.  I recommend that the Board approve the proposal set forth in para. 21 of this report that \nbitumen procured from non-member countries of ADB for civil works under the Rural Road \nSector Project be eligible for financing from the proposed supplementary loan. If the requisite \naffirmative votes of directors representing not less than two thirds of the total voting power of \nADB member countries, pursuant to Article 14 (ix) of the Agreement Establishing the Asian \nDevelopment Bank, is not obtained for this recommendation and the Board only approves the \nrecommendation in para. 42, then only bitumen for civil works procured from member countries \nof ADB will be eligible for financing under the Rural Road Sector Project. \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n \n15 October 2008\n ", "Appendix 1  11\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n    Data Sources and/or   \nDesign  Performance Targets and/or  Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nPoverty  Reduced poverty levels in the  National statistics  The Government continues to \nreduction in the  project area from 29.8% in 2007 to    accord high priority to the \nproject area  13.0% in 2017, using a national  Asian Development  Poverty Reduction Strategy \n  poverty line based on annual  Bank (ADB) project  Paper and the Lifeline Road \nhousehold surveys prepared by the  performance audit  Network Program \nNational Statistics Services  report  \n \nOutcome       Assumptions \nImproved  Level of motorized traffic on  Direct measures of  \u2022 Continued political stability \naccess of rural  improved roads increased by  traffic volume, road  and economic growth in \npopulations in  average of 40% from 2007 within  roughness, and travel  Armenia and the region \nthe project area  2 years of project completion  time through periodic  \u2022 Effective implementation of \nto jobs, markets,    surveys conducted by  the Poverty Reduction and \nand social  Value of goods carried on improved  the Armenian Roads  Strategy Paper \nservices, and  roads increased by an average of  Directorate   \u2022 Adequate government \nthe major trunk  20% from 2007 within 2 years of    funding for the road sector \nroad networks  project completion  Periodic household  \u2022 Sufficient capacity of \nthrough    surveys in the project  domestic road construction \nreduction in    area  and maintenance \nroad transport  Reduction in travel time by more    companies \ncosts  than 40% on average for the whole  Project progress   \nRisk \n  Project after project completion  reports \nInadequate maintenance of \nfrom the appraisal time in 2006   \nthe project road after \n  ADB review missions \ncompletion because of \n   \ninsufficient funding  \n  ADB project \n \n  completion report \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \nImprovement to  Complete rehabilitation of rural  Consultant\u2019s contract  \u2022 Continued high priority \nhigh-priority  roads totaling about 220 kilometers  milestones  given by the Government to \nroads  (km)     the Project \n      \u2022 The Government\u2019s \n  Average surface roughness for the  Project progress  continued cooperation \nsubprojects reduced from an  reports  during project \n \ninternational roughness index of    implementation \n \n10.9 m/km in 2007 to no more than  ADB review missions  \u2022 Availability of key statistics \n  4.0 m/km after project completion    and information relating to \n    ADB project  the Project \n  Reduction in vehicle operating  completion report  \u2022 High-quality consulting \ncosts by more than 40% on    services for subproject \n \naverage for the whole Project after    preparation and \n  project completion   construction supervision  \n \n    Risks \n    \u2022 Project implementation \n     delay \n \n\u2022 Poor quality of civil works \n \n\u2022 Price increases of oil  and \n \nother road construction \n \nmaterials  \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "12  Appendix 1 \n Activities with Milestones  Inputs \n 1.

Introduction \n1.  The  original  Rural  Road  Sector  Project1 funded  specific  physical  and  nonphysical \ninvestments in four regions of Armenia. The expected outputs of the investment components \ncontinue to be: (i) improvements to about 220 kilometers (km) of high-priority roads, (ii) an \nimprovement  to  the  transport  management  capability  of  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and \nCommunications (MOTC), and (iii) an improvement to the road asset management capability of \nthe Armenian Roads Directorate. \n \n2.  An economic analysis was undertaken for the physical investment component for each \nrural road section (subproject). \n \nB.  Methodology \n3.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) and the net present value (NPV) were \ncalculated by comparing the with- and without-project scenarios for 2008\u20132029, including a 3-\nyear construction period. The highway development and management model 4 was used as the \nbasis for the analysis. Seasonal adjustments were made to the traffic counts, based on an \nassessment  of  the  local  situations.  No  salvage  value  was  considered  at  the  end  of  each \nsubproject\u2019s  economic  life.  All  costs  and  benefits  were  valued  in  constant  2008  prices \nexpressed in US dollars. \n \n4.  The economic analysis used the world price numeraire, excluding all taxes and duties. \nThe  economic  costs  of  nontraded  goods  were  converted  to  the  world  price  level  using  a \nstandard conversion factor of 0.80.  \n \n5.  The economic costs are derived from the actual bidding price received by the project \nmanagement unit for package 1 and the projected package 2 bid prices, excluding taxes and \nduties, interest and other charges during construction. The construction period was based on \nthe implementation schedule. For the without-project case, a continued worsening of the surface \ncondition is assumed to reach the standard maximum international roughness index (IRI) values \nby  pavement  type  before  receiving  pavement  overlay  and/or  re-graveling  treatment.  The \nmaintenance cost for each road section was assumed at regular intervals. \n \n6.  The original economic benefits in the Rural Road Sector Project were assumed to be \nvalid. With the Project, access to rural areas will be improved, providing savings in road user \ntime and vehicle operating costs. Traffic counts in December 2006 were assumed to be valid. \nCombined generated and induced traffic were assumed conservatively to be 20% of normal \ntraffic.  Generated  and  induced  benefits  are  typically  evaluated  at  50%  of  normal  traffic \nbenefits\u2014equivalent to a normal traffic increase of 10%.

Conclusion. The results of the economic analysis presented in Tables A6.2 and A6.3 \nshow that the estimated EIRRs for the subprojects range from 4% to 79% and the EIRR for the \nProject  as  a  whole  is  estimated  at  34%.  These  results  indicate  that  the  Project  can  be \nconsidered robust, as they are greater than the economic opportunity cost of capital of 12%. \nThese values are conservative as the economic evaluation has only considered quantifiable \nincremental benefits, as in the original Project.  \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20081016143704+08'00'", "Subject": "Proposed Supplementary Loan", "Author": "ncb", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Keywords": "rural road sector project, adb proposed supplementary loan, armenia social investment fund, lifeline road network program, transport and communications, road connectivity improvement, road infrastructure management, adb loan 2467, adb project 40610", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20081112155757+08'00'", "Title": "Rural Road Sector Project"}}
