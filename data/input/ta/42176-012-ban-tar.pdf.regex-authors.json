INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Bangladesh asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for policy \nand advisory technical assistance (TA) to establish a regulatory framework for urban water \nsupply and sanitation. ADB included the TA in the 2013 program of the country operations \nbusiness plan, 2013\u20132015 for Bangladesh.1  \n \n2.  The ADB fact-finding mission during 18\u201321 November 2012 reached an understanding \nwith the government on the TA impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, \nfinancing arrangements, and outline terms of reference.2 The design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  In 2010, 81% of the Bangladesh population was supplied with water, compared with the \nglobal  average  of  89%  and the  South  Asia regional  average  of  90%.3 Although  coverage \nreached 85% in urban areas, access to piped water supply in household premises is provided to \nonly 20% of the urban population, requiring significant improvement in service. Of the total 316 \nmunicipalities, only 102 have piped water supply systems, which generally provide intermittent \ndaily supply of less than 10 hours.4 Sanitation coverage is lower, with only 57% of the urban \npopulation  having  access  to  improved  sanitation  facilities  in  2010.  In  the  whole  country, \nwastewater treatment is provided to only a small part of Dhaka. The water supply and sanitation \n(WSS) subsector is plagued with high unaccounted for water (averaging about 25% or more),5 \ninadequate  cost  recovery  caused  by  low  tariffs,  limited  utility  autonomy,  and  operating \ninefficiency, resulting in poor service delivery in many urban areas of the country. \n \n4.  The Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives has statutory \nresponsibility for WSS, including policy decisions, sectoral budgetary allocation, and evaluation \nand monitoring of policies and projects. The Department of Public Health Engineering and water \nsupply and sewerage authorities (WASAs) function under the administrative control of the Local \nGovernment  Division  (LGD)  of  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government,  Rural  Development  and \nCooperatives. WASAs are responsible for WSS service provision in Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna, \nand Rajshahi, and municipalities (pourashavas) and city corporations (except for the four cities) \nprovide WSS services in their jurisdictions, with technical support from the Department of Public \nHealth Engineering. The Policy Support Unit (PSU) was established in 1999 in LGD to lead \npolicy development for WSS. \n \n5.  Reforms are needed in two areas: (i) institutional development of water utilities, including \nWASAs, city corporations, and municipalities; and (ii) establishment of a regulatory framework. \nThese are heavily intertwined because a regulatory framework cannot usually succeed without \ninstitutionally developed and more autonomous utilities, and the sustainability of institutionally \ndeveloped utilities will be difficult without an independent regulator. The primary objective of \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2012. Country Operations Business Plan: Bangladesh, 2013\u20132015. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 15 October 2012. \n3  World Health Organization and United Nations Children\u2019s Fund. 2012.

Benchmarking for \nImproving Water Supply Delivery. Dhaka. \n5  Preliminary results from the benchmarking study undertaken for 33 utilities in 2010\u20132011 presented at the meeting \nof the Water Supply and Sanitation Sub-Group of the Local Consultative Group on 2 October 2012 (to be \npublished).  \n ", "2   \nestablishing an economic regulatory framework is to ensure the provision of WSS services in an \nefficient,  transparent,  and  equitable  manner  by  (i)  protecting  the  interests  of  customers,  \n(ii)  ensuring  that  customers  receive  the  expected  services,  (iii)  ensuring  that  services  are \ndelivered at fair and reasonable tariffs, (iv) ensuring financial sustainability of utilities while \nproviding incentives for efficiency, and (v) providing certainty for private sector investments. \n \n6.  The government recognizes the need for a WSS regulator, and a policy condition was \nincorporated in the ongoing ADB-financed sector development program.6 In accordance with the \ncondition, the government undertook a study on the most appropriate form for an independent \nwater regulator. The study, supported by ADB TA (footnote 6), concluded that the creation of a \nfully mandated regulatory body would be premature because water utilities do not have enough \nautonomy and resources, and their commercial and financial systems are not strong. Instead, \nthe regulatory framework can be established in two stages, by first creating a water cell in LGD \nand then an independent water economic regulatory commission (WERC) after 3\u20135 years. The \nwater cell will lead reform initiatives for utilities and prepare sector conditions for establishing the \nWERC  as  outlined  in  the  government\u2019s  Sector  Development  Plan  (FY2011\u2013FY2025).7 In \nJanuary 2011, the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives issued a \nnotification to establish a water cell in the PSU. The water cell needs to be made fully functional \nwith  clear  mandates  to  achieve  the  intended  objectives,  for  which  the  government  has \nrequested additional support from ADB.8    \n \n7.  The TA supports an important government reform agenda for WSS as elaborated in the \nSector  Development  Plan  (footnote  7).  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2011\u20132015  for \nBangladesh recognizes WSS, included in the urban sector, as one of six priority sectors, and \nhighlights improvement of the legal and regulatory framework of the urban water subsector.9 \nThe TA is a follow-on from the ongoing loan and past TA, and is linked with the planned Khilkhet \nWater  Treatment  Plant  Project  in  Dhaka.10 The  establishment  of  an  economic  regulatory \nframework will improve the enabling environment for enhancing public\u2013private partnerships, \nwhich is being considered in the project. Danida, Denmark\u2019s development cooperation under the \nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, is supporting institutional development of the PSU, including sector \ncoordination and policy implementation and monitoring, which complements the TA activities.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact will be a strengthened policy and institutional environment for improved \nurban water supply in Bangladesh. The outcome will be a fully operating water cell with clear \nmandates and necessary tools.  \n \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2007.

Output 1: Developing adequate rules and standards for regulating and monitoring \nwater  utilities  in  the  urban  sector.  This  output  will  support  formulation  of  a  regulatory \nframework for urban water supply and sanitation; the initial focus will be on water supply. Tasks \ninclude (i) draft financial management regulation, including billing and collection systems, and \npreparation of financial statement; (ii) draft service standards and key performance indicators \nthat will be reported by the water utilities and monitored by the water cell; (iii) draft tariff-setting \nand review methodologies to enable independent, transparent, and predictable tariff-setting \ncommensurate with service offered, while ensuring financial sustainability of water utilities; (iv) \ndraft customer service regulations to protect the interests of customers; (v) develop finance and \noperating reporting requirements for water utilities to the water cell; (vi) recommend, if deemed \nnecessary, legislative changes to make water utilities more autonomous to provide an incentive \nfor them to improve operating efficiency; and (vii) undertake a study of subsidies to water \nutilities  for  capital  and  operating  expenditures,  resulting  in  recommendations  on  subsidy \nrationalization and an appropriate subsidy mechanism. Service standards and key performance \nindicators define the service obligation of water utilities relating to the provision of water supply \nand sewerage services: they may include hours of supply, residual pressure, drinking water \nquality standards, nonrevenue water, number of staff per 1,000 connections, and operating \nratios. The water quality monitoring framework, including the scope, parameters to be analyzed, \nand  sampling  and  analysis  methodologies,  will  be  included  to  particularly  address \nmicrobiological and residual chlorine requirements.   \n \n10.  Output 2: Monitoring performance of water utilities. This output will assist the water \ncell in commencing performance monitoring of water utilities by using the rules, regulations, and \nstandards  drafted  under  output  1  and  approved  by  the  government.  Tasks  include  \n(i) communicate the regulatory framework and reporting requirements to major water utilities, \nsuch as the WASAs in Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna, and Rajshahi, and other city corporations \nand large municipalities; (ii) ensure the major water utilities (initial target: five) submit reports in \nconformity  with  the  reporting  requirements;  (iii)  establish  a  database  for  monitoring  the \nperformance of utilities; and (iv) prepare the first monitoring report by reviewing and verifying \nsubmissions  made  by  the  major  water  utilities.  Major  water  utilities  will  be  provided  with \nnecessary guidance and advice to ensure the reports submitted are of satisfactory quality. \n \n11.  Output  3:  Initiating  preparation  for  establishing  a  water  economic  regulatory \ncommission. Based on an assessment of the progress and achievements made in outputs 1 \nand 2, a feasible road map for establishing the full-fledged independent commission will be \ndrafted. The organization structure, clear mandates and responsibilities, staff requirements, and \ntime-bound actions, among others, will be proposed. The work will involve close consultation \nwith all relevant government agencies and other stakeholders.  \n \n12.  Output 4: Strengthening the capacity of relevant agencies for implementing the \nregulatory functions. This output will strengthen the capacity of government officers in line \nwith their responsibilities. Tasks include (i) assess capacity requirements in accordance with the \nfunctions of the water cell; (ii) prepare a capacity development program; and (iii) implement the \ncapacity development program through classroom training, workshops and seminars, on-the-job \ntraining, and an exposure visit to a country in Asia where a similar regulatory framework is \nalready being practiced successfully. While the main targets of the capacity strengthening will \nbe the staff of the water cell, officers of other relevant government agencies and major water \nutilities may also participate in the capacity development program. Resource persons may be \ninvited to participate in the programs as needed, with financing from the training budget. \n ", "4   \n \n13.  Assumptions and risks. The government\u2019s continued commitment to reform is a major \nrisk. While it has already approved the establishment of the water cell, advancement of the \nreform may encounter delays in the government\u2019s approval process. An effective regulatory \nframework  requires  higher  autonomy  for  water  utilities,  which  may  be  possible  only  with \nlegislative changes. However, the government\u2019s commitment is currently strong. For example, \nLGD  issued  a  circular  in  2009  to  municipalities  to  improve  their  financial  and  accounting \nsystems, including establishment of a separate account for revenue from water supply and \nintroduction of a double-entry bookkeeping system for water supply sections. This risk can be \nmitigated to a manageable level by engaging the government closely in TA implementation. \nWhile the government requested 4\u20135 years of ADB support, the TA will cover the initial 2 years \nto confirm the government\u2019s renewed commitment. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $820,000, of which (i) $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV); and (ii) $250,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by the Netherlands Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership Facility, \nand administered by ADB. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of (i) any \nrelevant  documents,  data,  statistics,  information,  or  maps  that  the  government  has  at  its \ndisposal; (ii) adequate number of qualified counterpart staff in the water cell, including their field \nper diem and field transportation; (iii) office accommodation and office equipment, including \ndesks, chairs, and local communication (but excluding computers, printers, and photocopiers); \n(iv) logistical assistance for the workshops and seminars, including venue provision and sending \ninvitations to participants; and (v) other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The PSU under LGD will be the executing agency. It will appoint qualified counterpart \nstaff to take the lead in supervising all tasks performed by the consultants and coordinating the \nactivities with relevant organizations. A national steering committee (NSC) will be established to \nmonitor TA implementation. The LGD secretary will chair the NSC, which will comprise senior \nrepresentatives from the Planning Commission, Dhaka WASA, the Department of Public Health \nEngineering,  the  Economic  Relations  Division,  the  Finance  Division,  existing  regulatory \ncommission(s), LGD, the Local Government Engineering Department, the Municipal Association \nof Bangladesh, and the PSU.11 The head of the PSU will be a member and the convener of the \nNSC.  The  NSC  will  meet  at  least  biannually  to  discuss  overall  TA  progress,  strengthen \ninterministerial coordination, and provide policy guidance for TA implementation. Under the \noverall guidance of the NSC, the existing monitoring committee chaired by the LGD additional \nsecretary will meet at least quarterly to discuss detailed progress of the TA. Progress will be \nregularly reported to the Water Supply and Sanitation Sub-Group of the Local Consultative \nGroup.  \n \n16.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  from  June  2013  to  June  2015.  The  outline  terms  of \nreference for consultants are in Appendix 3. International expertise (15 person-months) will be \nobtained in the areas of financial regulation and water sector policy reform. National consultants \n(41  person-months)  will  have  expertise  in  water  sector  policy  reform,  financial  regulation, \n                                                \n11 An existing NSC, which was previously established for Danida support to the PSU, will be used with necessary \nadjustments. \n ", "  5 \ninstitutional development, and legal issues. ADB will engage the consultants in accordance with \nits Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). A team of \nconsultants will be recruited through a firm under one package using the quality- and cost-based \nmethod of selection with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10. This ratio is justified due to the expertise \nand quality required in the assignment. A simplified technical proposal will be used for the \nselection of the consultant firm. In addition to the team described in Appendix 3, a few individual \nconsultants may be engaged to address specific TA needs. Disbursement under the TA will be \nmade  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as \namended from time to time). Some equipment, such as computers and printers, will be procured \nusing  the  shopping  method,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as \namended from time to time). All equipment, including software, purchased under the TA will be \nprovided to the PSU after TA completion. ADB will undertake a TA review, in collaboration with \nLGD, at least twice a year during TA implementation. \n \n17.  The  consultants  will  assist  the  government  in  organizing  workshops  during  TA \nimplementation. Consultation workshops with major water utilities and other stakeholders will be \nheld to seek their inputs in the drafts and disseminate the final documents. The workshops will \nalso serve as a venue to share good practices and lessons identified during TA implementation. \nThe consultants will ensure coordination with related programs of other development partners, \nincluding those by Danida and the Water and Sanitation Program funded by the World Bank, to \nmaximize complementarities and avoid duplication. Orientation training for counterpart staff in \nthe water cell and other relevant officers in the PSU and LGD will be held within the first 2 \nmonths. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $250,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Netherlands Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership \nFacility; and (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant \nbasis, to the Government of Bangladesh for Establishing a Regulatory Framework for Urban \nWater Supply and Sanitation, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \nand Indicators with  Reporting \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nStrengthened policy  WERC established by  Government gazette  Government grants higher \nand institutional  2018  autonomy to water utilities  \nenvironment for  Water utilities exercise their \nimproved urban water  power to improve their \nsupply in Bangladesh  performance and operating \nefficiency \nOutcome  By the end of 2015    Assumption \nWater cell operating  Urban water utilities  Performance  Water utilities collaborate \nwith clear mandates  reporting their  evaluation reports  with the new framework \nand necessary tools  issued by water cell   \nperformance to the \nwater cell (target: five)    Risks \n    Government does not \nTariff approval  Notification issued  provide enough budget for \nmechanism endorsed by  by the Ministry of  the water cell \nthe government and  Local Government,  Government is reluctant to \napplied in two cases  Rural Development  dismiss its control over tariff \nand Cooperatives  setting \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
