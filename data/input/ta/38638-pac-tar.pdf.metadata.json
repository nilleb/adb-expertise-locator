The Asian Development Bank (ADB) recognizes the critical importance of civil society and civil \nsociety organizations (CSOs1) to sustainable development and poverty reduction in the Pacific region. \nLegitimizing and enlarging civil society\u2019s operational environment and strengthening the influence and \ncapacity of CSOs are considered prerequisites for achieving the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs) and reducing hardship and poverty in the region. The need for improved governance as the \ncornerstone  of  poverty  alleviation  and  sustainable  economic  growth  also  justifies  the  greater \nparticipation of civil society in development. \n \n2.  Over the past several years ADB has supported various efforts to strengthen civil society\u2019s \nparticipation  in  development  in  the  Pacific,  including  the  formulation  of  national  development \nstrategies, and the holding of round-table meetings and informal, confidential retreats with external \nfunding agencies.2 ADB has consulted with civil society in formulating country strategies, programs, \nand  projects.  Its  renewed  emphasis  on  enhanced  external  funding  agency  coordination, \nharmonization, and regional cooperation among external funding agencies further reinforces the need \nfor a joint effort by external funding agencies to strengthen civil society at the local, national, and \nregional  levels.  ADB\u2019s  previous  and  ongoing  involvement  with  CSOs  has  shown  that  effective \nengagement  requires  a  strategic,  multidimensional,  demand-driven  approach  modeled  on  the \nprinciples of partnership and best practice. \n \n3.  In May and June 2005, ADB missions3 met with representatives of regional and national CSOs \nin Fiji at the Pacific Islands Association of Non-Governmental Organisations (PIANGO) office to \ndiscuss  possible  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  help  implement  the  Pacific  strategy4  and  further \nstrengthen the participation of civil society in development. Participants at the meetings discussed \ndevelopment lessons learned, prioritized the capacity-building needs of CSOs, and reviewed current \ninitiatives and priority areas of potential collaboration among external funding agencies. The TA \ndesign was further developed by a staff consultant in correspondence with external funding agencies \nwith a major presence in the region. CSO stakeholders concur with the overall goals, purpose, and \nscope of the TA.5 The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n \n                                                 \n1 The term \u201ccivil society organization\u201d refers to a broad range of non-state actors including nongovernment organizations, \ncommunity-based organizations, faith-based organizations, public institutions, and associations with diverse interests that \nprovide both support and a counterweight to government. This paper also takes an inclusive view by including the private \nbusiness sector and the voluntary sector. \n2  ADB. 2001.

CSOs also made a substantial contribution to the development of this strategy. \n5  The TA project first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 6 May 2005. ", "2     \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  CSOs in the Pacific region continue to struggle to meet the growing needs and demands of \nmarginalized  people  (including  women  and  youth)  and  underserved  communities,  both  in  direct \nservices delivery and in the more indirect CSO responsibility of advocacy. Because of their limited \nsize and resource base, most CSOs do their work with minimal training and technical support, and \nhave difficulty attracting and retaining suitably qualified personnel to meet the complex demands on \nCSOs. The need to provide TA for Pacific CSOs in a wide range of operational and strategic areas \nhas been well documented. In addition to the Pacific strategy, the training needs analysis in 2005 for \nthe ADB Leadership Enhancement and Advancement Program (LEAP) summarized the following \npriority learning needs of CSOs: (i) policy analysis and issue identification, (ii) advocacy techniques, \n(iii) engagement with the government and business, (iv) community development, and (v) resource \ngeneration and mobilization.6  \n \n5.  For  the  most  part,  CSOs  receive  little financial  support from  governments.  They  can  be \ndismissed as \u201ctroublemakers\u201d and seen as competition for aid resources. Most Pacific developing \nmember countries (PDMCs) moreover lack the legal and regulatory frameworks needed to support the \ngrowth and development of the sector. Without clearly defined and well-enforced legal structures, the \nrights of CSOs are unprotected, making it difficult for advocacy-oriented organizations to function \nwithout untoward interference. Given the low level of political and economic literacy in many PDMCs, \nCSOs are instrumental in educating people about democratic and human rights and promoting good \ngovernance. \n \n6.  CSOs often compete for scarce resources and may maintain, if not deepen, the factions in \nsociety.  Regional  CSO  networks  like  the  Pacific  Regional  Non-Governmental  Organizations \n(PRNGOs)7 are in the formative stage and have had only limited success in coordinating CSOs and \ninfluencing national and regional plans and policies. The summary findings of the special evaluation \nstudy of the role of NGOs and community-based organizations (CBOs)8 revealed that several key \nfactors underpin effective NGO or CBO involvement in ADB projects. These factors include (i) the \noverall environment, (ii) government-NGO working relations, (iii) the nature of consultations, and \n(iv) current  NGO  capacity.  This  research  concluded  that  \u201csuccessful  NGO  or  CBO  involvement \nrequires an enabling environment and effective working relations between partners.\u201d  \n \n7.  According to the 2004 study on ADB-NGO relations in the Pacific,9 CSOs expected ADB to be \nmore involved in strengthening and legitimizing civil society and increasing civic engagement in \ndevelopment processes at the national and regional levels. As such, the study urged ADB to take the \nfollowing actions to enhance engagement with CSOs: (i) promote an enabling environment for civic \nengagement; (ii) build the capacity of civil society; (iii) ensure the full participation of CSOs and the \nintegration  of  civil  society  issues  in  the  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP);  (iv)  enhance  the \nparticipation of CSOs in project preparation, implementation, and evaluation; and (v) address internal \noperational constraints on effective engagement with the CSO sector. The study also recommended \nthat  ADB  work  through  CSO  networks  to  optimize  multiplier  effects  and  strengthen  sector-wide \ncommunication and collective action. The review further stated that in some countries \u201cADB is ideally \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2005.

ADB\u2019s  comparative \nadvantage  may  therefore  rest  in  its  ability  to  serve  as  a  catalyst  and  broker  in  bringing  key \nstakeholders together around a common agenda, i.e., poverty reduction and the achievement of the \nMDGs. \n \n8.  One  of  the  three  strategic  objectives  of  ADB\u2019s  Pacific  strategy  is  to  promote  effective \ndevelopment processes. The key result areas for this objective include (i) increased community \nparticipation  and  ownership  in  development  programs;  (ii)  increased  public  demand  for  good \ngovernance and effective markets and services; (iii) increased dialogue and cooperation among civil \nsociety  organizations,  private  sector  groups,  and  governments;  (iv)  improved  availability  and \ndissemination of good-quality data and information on development issues; and (v) strengthened \ncapacity of PDMC governments, civil society, and private sector groups to plan and manage for \ndevelopment results. \n \n9.  During  TA  design  consultations,  Pacific  CSO  representatives  recommended  the  following \nseven  capacity-building  objectives:  (i)  strengthen  national  laws,  regulations,  and  other  legal \nframeworks  that  enable  CSOs  to  operate  transparently  and  independently  of  the  state;10 \n(ii) strengthen the ability of CSOs to promote and advocate social, environmental, good governance, \nand other public concerns, with ADB possibly operating as a broker for improved relations between \ngovernments and CSOs; (iii) continue ADB\u2019s program of assistance to strengthen CSO understanding \nand  participation  in  budgeting  processes,  including  gender  budgeting;  (iv)  strengthen  CSO \nparticipation in the full cycle of development assistance strategy, including project design and loan \nimplementation, TA design, and monitoring and evaluation activities for ADB and other agencies as \nappropriate; (v) secure continuity of funding for CSO programs to sustain, expand, and improve \nservice delivery, with ADB possibly facilitating government outsourcing of public funds and services to \nCSOs on a pilot basis; (vi) better meet people\u2019s right to information through improved CSO databases \nand through modern information and communications technology (internet, satellite, teleconferencing, \nand videoconferencing) and more traditional media; and (vii) strengthen CSO evaluation, analysis, \nand reporting capacities. Gender mainstreaming is seen as central to objectives (ii), (iii), and (iv). \n \n10.  Other  external  funding  agencies  (principally  the  Australian  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment [AusAID], the European Union, the New Zealand Agency for International Development \n[NZAID], and the United Nations Development Programme and other UN agencies) have long been \nworking with Pacific CSOs in strengthening both service delivery and advocacy. In addition to the \ndirect financing of CSO programs, these external funding agencies plan to continue to help build CSO \ncapacity,  strengthen  legitimacy,  and  improve  advocacy  and  policy-making  skills.  In  response  to \nserious concerns regarding the limitations of one-off financial and technical assistance, many of these \nexternal funding agencies are now moving away from the project-by-project approach and toward \nlong-term \u201cstrategic partnerships\u201d with national and regional NGOs. Details of other external funding \nagency support to Pacific CSOs are presented in Appendix 3. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome  \n11.  The pilot TA is designed to build on and complement ongoing and planned ADB and other \nexternal funding agency assistance to civil society in the Pacific. It proposes to strengthen CSO \nunderstanding of development policy and directly engage CSOs with their governments and external \n                                                 \n10  PDMC government executives working with CSOs have subsequently suggested that CSO \u201clegitimacy\u201d could be better \nstrengthened through proven practical engagement rather than through legislation. ", "4     \nfunding agencies in the design, formulation, and implementation of ADB\u2019s own country strategies, \nprograms,  and projects as an example to all development programs.11 The expected outcomes \ninclude (i) a more developmentally aware and effective (less factionalized) civil society as CSOs gain \nsignificantly greater understanding and influence in the formulation, implementation, and evaluation of \ngovernment  and  external  funding  agency  policies  and  they  ensure  that  development  plans  are \nconstituent-directed and publicly accountable; (ii) establishment of the means and best practices for \ncivil society participation in development; (iii) actual increased civil society participation in advocacy, \nplanning and policy making, and possibly also in the subsequent delivery of some services, at least in \nthe  case  of  ADB-financed  programs;  (iv)  a  consequent  heightened  demand  by  civil  society  for \nimproved public services and responsive markets; (v) consequent improved collaboration between \nPDMC governments, external funding agencies, and CSOs; and (vi) greater acceptance of the role \n(legitimacy) of civil society in development.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA focuses on legitimizing and mainstreaming civil society participation in development \nprocesses and strengthening relations between CSOs, PDMC governments, the private sector, and \nexternal  funding  agencies  through  training  and  direct  engagement  in  the  ADB  development \nassistance cycle. To achieve this, the TA focuses not only on introducing formal processes for \ninvolvement by CSOs, but also on enhancing the competence and capacity of CSOs to be effective in \nthis involvement. This will be achieved through two major components. \n \n13.  The first component focuses on enhancing the competence of Pacific CSO staff to better \nunderstand and comment on the region\u2019s broad development policy agendas. This component will \nprovide high-level advice and training in broad development policy, as well as direct engagement in \ndiscussions with relevant government officials and with ADB and other external funding agencies on \ncountry strategy, program, and project formulation. This component will build on the work completed \nunder  other  regional  TAs  to  produce  a  summary  of  \u201cwhat  works,\u201d  or  the  development  policy \nconsensus.12 This component will help relevant CSOs to produce development policy comment on \neach specific country strategy or project to be covered by the pilot TA and in support of general policy \ndialogue in each PDMC. This component will also help regional CSOs to prepare policy inputs for \nregional meetings and develop the capacity of CSOs for informed engagement in regional forums. \n \n14.  The  second  component  consists  of  formal  training  for  CSO  and  government  staff  in  the \nplanning of participatory processes, together with practical engagement with ADB, other external \nfunding agencies, and other members of civil society and government in the participatory formulation \nof the next two ADB country strategies and programs (CSPs) in 2007 (for Fiji and Samoa), and two \nloan designs (PNG Health Sector Support and FSM Waste Management) also scheduled for 2007.13 \nKey tasks include (i) formal training in participatory processes, using the ADB project cycle as a case \nstudy; (ii) inclusion in ADB missions of formal consultations with sector, national, and regional CSOs \nin CSP preparation and loan design, including opportunities to give views on issues and options, \n                                                 \n11 Other external funding agencies are concerned more with assisting CSOs in service delivery and building general      \ncapacity. Also, \u201clegitimacy\u201d or an enabling environment might indeed be better constructed through proven practical \nengagement rather than through legislation. This picks up on the recommendations of LEAP (para. 4, items i, ii, and iii); \nthe Special Evaluation Study (para. 6, items ii and iii); the 2004 study on ADB-NGO relations in the Pacific (para. 7, items \niii and iv); and TA design consultations (para. 9, items ii and iv). \n12 ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance for the Strengthening Pro-Poor Policy in the Pacific. Manila. Produced under this TA, \nthis consensus is based on the 16 criteria used by the World Bank for its country performance and institutional \nassessment. \n13 Selected CSPs and loans will serve as examples for the Pacific region. Representatives from CSOs and Governments \nfrom the other 10 PDMCs will be invited to attend the formal training sessions. The selection might change as the TA is \nimplemented. \n ", "      5\ncontribute position papers, and endorse the final programs; and (iii) research, development, and \npromulgation of best practices and a framework for value-added involvement by CSOs in CSP and \nloan  preparation,  implementation,  and  evaluation,  including  formal  consultation  processes.  The \nimplementation of this component will improve CSP and loan performance; enhance ADB visibility \nand transparency; foster improved dialogue and cooperation between governments, external funding \nagencies, private sector groups, and CSOs; and address ADB internal operational constraints on \neffective engagement with CSOs.14\n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $565,000. The amount of $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis  from  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  Relevant  regional  and  national  CSOs  will  provide  the \nremaining $65,000 by covering local counterpart staffing, office facilities, funds for local travel for CSO \nstaff, and support with the preparation of national reports and with communications and national \ndissemination. Cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The  Executing  Agency  (EA)  for  the  two  CSPs  shall  be  the  Pacific  Centre  for  Resource \nConcerns (PCRC), and the EA for the two  project preparatory TAs shall be PIANGO. Steering \ncommittees with broad but relevant representation from NGOs, churches, women\u2019s groups, media \ngroups, trade unions, and chambers of commerce will be established for each activity, with the chair \nto be determined locally. The EAs will collaborate with the national steering committees. Country desk \nofficers  and  project  officers  at  the  Pacific  Department  headquarters  and  resident  missions  will \ncoordinate their work programs with each steering committee as appropriate.  \n \n17.  A team of international and local consultants will be recruited under the management of a \nconsulting firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, using simplified \ntechnical proposal and quality- and cost-based selection. A total of 24 person-months (12 international \nand 12 local) will be required for this TA. The consulting team will consist of an international team \nleader  and  participatory  processes  planning  expert  (5  person-months),  international  participatory \nprocesses trainers (3 person-months), an international development economist and development \npolicy expert (4 person-months), and local social development analysts (total 12 person-months). A \nresearch economist (12 person-months) will also be engaged by ADB in Manila, in accordance with \nthe  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the \nengagement of local consultants, to help collate, summarize, and present relevant development policy \ninformation for each PDMC. Outline terms of reference are provided in Appendix 4. The pilot TA is \nexpected to start in mid-2006 and to be completed late in 2007. Depending on the progress of this TA, \nfurther funding will be sought to cover the remaining PDMCs. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the provision \nof technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to the governments \nof  Fiji,  the  Federated  States  of  Micronesia,  Papua  New  Guinea,  and  Samoa  for  the  Pilot \nStrengthening of Civil Society Participation in Development in the Pacific and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n                                                 \n14 The methodology and activities will build on earlier consultations and participatory processes successfully employed in the \nADB country program in the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the joint AusAID and ADB assistance to Nauru for the \nformulation of a national sustainable development strategy.

The New Zealand Agency for International Development has developed a strategic \npartnership with the Pacific Islands Association of Non-Governmental Organizations (PIANGO), \nan umbrella group of nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and other select regional and \nnational bodies. Long-term assistance is premised on an initial assessment of institutional-\nstrengthening needs and development priorities of beneficiaries.  \n \n2.  The  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID)  also  supports  some \nstrategic partnerships and has indicated that this approach is likely to expand in coming years. \nIn particular, AusAID has provided successful multi-year funding support to the Fiji Women\u2019s \nCrisis Center and the regional network for violence against women. \n \n3.  The European Union Cotonou Agreement provides up to 15% of the Ninth European \nDevelopment Fund (10% in the case of Kiribati and Tuvalu; 15% for Fiji) for NGO program \nfunding. Areas funded will depend on the priorities set by each recipient country. Under the \nAgreement, a national body from the Pacific developing member country concerned will set \nfunding criteria and select the NGOs to be supported. Within the framework of the Lom\u00e9 \nConvention,  the  European  Centre  on  Pacific  Issues  is  working  on  decentralized  capacity \nbuilding in strategic partnership with regional organizations like the Pacific Centre for Resource \nConcerns.  \n \n4.  Until  recently,  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  and  the  Canadian \nInternational Development Agency jointly supported a regional NGO-strengthening project with \na dedicated TA aimed at enhancing the capabilities of regional and national NGO umbrella \nbodies, principally PIANGO and its national liaison units (NLUs), and creating linkages between \nexternal funding agencies and NGOs throughout the region. This project was also responsible \nfor  orchestrating  coordination  meetings  among  the  various  external  funding  agencies  and \ninitiating the PIANGO/UNITEC  International Technology New Zealand Graduate Diploma in \nNon profit Management.  \n \n5.  Other multilateral funding agencies like the Commonwealth Foundation have supported \nNGO  capacity-building  initiatives  in  the  Pacific.  The  United  Nations  Volunteers  Special \nVoluntary Fund Project, supporting the strengthening of civil society in Fiji, Tonga, and Vanuatu, \nmay also be extended. Some European church-based organizations like Bread for the World, \nCatholic Committee Against Hunger and for Development and Interchurch Organization for \nDevelopment Cooperation provide core funding support for the institutional strengthening of \nselected NGOs and their networks in the Pacific. \n \n \n \n \n ", "10  Appendix 4 \nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTANTS \n \n1.  The pilot technical assistance (TA) is intended to legitimize and mainstream civil society \nparticipation  in  development  processes  and  strengthen  relations  between  Civil  Society \nOrganization (CSOs), Pacific developing member country (PDMC) governments, and the private \nsector by direct example, that is, by direct engagement of civil society in the development cycle \nof Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance.
