The Government of India (the Government) has emphasized the need for public\u2013private \npartnerships (PPPs) in addressing the enormous infrastructure gaps in the country. The Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  is  supporting  the  mainstreaming  of  PPPs  through  lending  and \nnonlending projects in India.1 With a view to bridging the infrastructure deficit in the rural sector, \nthe Government and ADB agreed on the objective, scope, implementation arrangements, and \nfinancing plan for capacity development technical assistance (TA) for a flagship government \nscheme, Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas (PURA). Fact-finding missions were fielded \nin November 2008 and January 2009. The TA is in line with (i) ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and \nProgram Update 2006\u20132008, (ii) ADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy \n2020) expectations for greater ADB involvement in private sector development, and (iii) Country \nOperations Business Plan 2008\u20132010.2 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  India\u2019s impressive economic growth rates, averaging close to 9% between fiscal year \n(FY) 2005 and FY2009, have considerably improved the population\u2019s economic circumstances. \nThe country\u2019s per capita income has been growing at an average annual rate of around 7.3% \nbetween FY2003 and FY2008.3 The latest per capita income (FY2008) at nominal exchange \nrate is estimated at $1,021, and the proportion of those below the poverty line is estimated to \nhave declined from around 36% of population in 1994 to 28% in 2004\u20132005.4  \n \n3.  Over 70% of the country\u2019s population of over 1 billion people live in rural areas, and the \nrural sector has a strong impact on India\u2019s economic growth, with agriculture and allied activities \naveraging 5.0% growth (2004\u20132008) (footnote 4). Although this growth rate has fallen sharply in \nFY2009, rural non-farm sector (i.e., rural services, manufacturing, utilities, and construction) \ngrowth is still significantly contributing to the gross domestic product. In fact, agriculture and \nallied activities together accounted for 17.8% of India's gross domestic product in 2007\u20132008. \nBenefits of economic growth in rural India are evidenced by a reduced gap in urban and rural \nincome levels, from around $82 per person in 1990 to around $56 in 2006\u20132007.5 The number \nof rural households with annual incomes greater than $2,000 in 2006\u20132007 was estimated at 56 \nmillion compared with 51 million of urban households. However, over 250 million people in rural \nareas still live below the poverty line, and poor-quality infrastructure in these areas inhibits \noverall  growth  of  India\u2019s  economy.  Accordingly,  rural  development  initiatives  for  inclusive \neconomic growth and sustainable poverty alleviation are key policy priorities of the Government.  \n \n4.  Several  government  schemes  have  focused  on  bridging  rural  infrastructure  gaps \nincluding (i) Bharat Nirman for upgrading rural infrastructure, (ii) Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak \nYojna for rural road connectivity, (iii) Indira Awas Yojna for rural housing, and (iv) the Rural \nElectrification Program. While these schemes have had a positive impact, rural India still suffers \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

Poor rural infrastructure and limited employment opportunities are major impediments to \ninclusive and sustainable rural sector growth7  as well as poverty reduction.8 Negative impacts \nare especially felt in the Ministry of Rural Development (MORD)-defined \u201curban amenities for \nrural areas\u201d in which, despite several schemes, investment requirements remain staggeringly \nhigh  and  levels  of  rural  road  density,  access  to  water,  sanitation,  electricity,  health  care, \neducation, and skills development remain far behind urban and peri-urban areas.9 Moreover, \nunsatisfactory implementation of some schemes has led to poorly maintained and operated \nassets.  Under  the  83rd  amendment  of  the  Constitution,  responsibility  for  PURA  lies  with \npanchayati raj institutions (PRIs),10 which also manage implementation of government schemes. \nHowever, existing capacity constraints at PRIs have led to wide variance in implementation and \nsustainability of assets created under such schemes.  \n \n6.  PPPs  are  recognized  by  MORD  and  the  Government  as  crucial  for  meeting  large \ninfrastructure investment requirements, effective project implementation, and sustainability of \nassets  and  operations.  A  rural  infrastructure  report11  has  identified,  however,  that  major \nobstacles remain to PPPs, including pricing of services, enabling factors for ensuring private \nsector returns on investments, and a proper regulatory regime. In addition, weak capacity at a \nproject sponsor level such as PRIs, lack of economies due to spread of villages, and lack of \ngood models for PPPs have deterred effective PPPs from emerging in the rural sector.  \n \n7.  To address these challenges, MORD revised the PURA scheme in early 2009 to focus \non effective implementation of sustainable project models in the rural sector through PPPs. The \nscheme aims at improved rural connectivity through packaging development of integrated rural \ninfrastructure clusters with livelihood development projects, both implemented through PPPs. \nCore  financing  will  remain  accessible  through  various  government  rural  schemes,  though \nimplemented more effectively by private parties with strong participation from user communities, \nPRIs, and MORD. MORD believes that the combination of critical mass infrastructure with \nlivelihood development will be economically attractive for both rural users and private sector \ncommercial interests.  \n \n8.  For effective implementation of the revised PURA scheme, MORD requires assistance \nfor (i) development of a PURA framework, integrating funds from various rural sector schemes \nthrough a PPP implementation model; (ii) PPP capacity building of MORD and local PRIs; (iii) \ndevelopment  of  scheme  rollout  systems;  (iv)  awareness  building  for  the  private  sector, \ncommercial institutions, and end-users of the PURA scheme; and (v) development of PURA \n                                                 \n6  UNDP India  2009..

The TA is a continuation of the series of \nefforts being made by ADB to mainstream PPPs in India. (footnote 2) \n \n  III.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA will support the Government in developing a PPP implementation modality for \nthe rural sector, the impacts of which will be improved coverage and sustainability of rural \ninfrastructure facilities and rural employment generation.12  \n \n10.  The outcome of the TA will be increased acceptance for, and involvement of, the private \nsector  in  providing  rural  infrastructure  in  selected  areas,  consistent  with  MORD's  PURA \nframework. This includes (i) enhanced acceptance of PPP models in the rural sector; (ii) greater \navailability  of  competitive  funds  for  rural  projects;  and  (iii)  improved  PPP  implementation, \ndevelopment, and monitoring capacities in MORD and local governments. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA proposes an integrated value chain of support including (i) supporting MORD in \ncreating an effective PURA framework; (ii) assisting PRIs in using the PURA scheme; (iii) \ncapacity building of stakeholders on the PURA scheme, including through a communication and \nadvocacy strategy; and (iv) developing bankable, replicable pilot PPP projects. \n \n12.  The TA will comprise four specific components which will be directed to support the \nMORD in New Delhi. Any support to PRIs and state governments under the TA will be limited to \nthose states benefiting from previous ADB assistance for mainstreaming PPPs:13  \n \n(i)  Component 1: Policy framework development (6 months). Development of \nthe overall PURA framework at MORD will include (a) defining sector policy \nobjectives  with  PPP  implementation  modalities  and  well-defined  scheme \nparameters; (b) defining cluster infrastructure asset classes to be funded through \nthe  PURA  scheme14  as  different  to  assets  being  developed  through  other \ngovernment schemes;15 (c) identifying existing government funding schemes \nrelevant to PURA asset classes, and developing a policy framework for these \nfunds to be integrated into the PURA framework for PPP implementation; (d) \ndeveloping  generic  PPP  models  and  related  contract  documents  for  PURA \nclusters to be incorporated as guidelines; (e) identifying viability gap funds, if \nrequired; (f) consulting with local governments, PRIs, and the private sector on \nthe PURA framework and PPP implementation modality; (g) identifying key risks \nand their mitigation for implementation; and (h) developing a communication and \nadvocacy strategy.  \n(ii)  Component 2: Development of PPP unit and scheme rollout procedures (12 \nmonths). Initially, this component will assist MORD in establishing a PURA PPP \n                                                 \n12 This will include better infrastructure in rural areas, rural employment generation, skills upgrading, and slowing \ndown the pattern of rural to urban migration. \n13 These states comprise Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, \nKarnataka,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Maharashtra,  Orissa,  Punjab,  Rajasthan,  Tamil  Nadu,  Uttaranchal,  and  Uttar \nPradesh. \n14 Cluster infrastructure to be developed under a PPP PURA will include essential urban amenities infrastructure (e.g., \nvillage streets, sewage, drainage, and end distribution of water supply) and add-on or livelihood infrastructure (e.g., \nmarketing centers, industrial parks for village industries, and technical and vocational training institutions). \n15 Expected to be core infrastructure (e.g., major roads, electricity, and bulk water supply to villages). \n ", "4 \nunit  to  house  the  PURA  framework  and  to  establish  systems  for  funds \ndisbursement and scheme and project monitoring. Subsequent transition period \nsupport will be provided to operationalize this unit, including capacity building of \nofficials. Activities will include (a) providing training on PURA scheme parameters \nand systems; (b) providing training on PPP modules such as value for money \nanalysis;  financial,  legal,  and  regulatory  structuring;  and  international  best \npractices;  (c)  developing  a  dynamic  monitoring  and  evaluation  management \ninformation system; and (d) developing rural sector-specific PPP guidelines and \nmanuals. \n(iii)  Component 3: Capacity building in local governments (15 months)16. PPP \nbest practices and PURA scheme awareness will be institutionalized through \ncapacity development workshops aimed at selected PRIs and other local and \nstate governments. \n(iv)  Component 4: Pilot project development (15 months). In consultation with the \nMORD  and  the  PURA  PPP  unit,  three  or  four  project  clusters  (i.e.,  urban \namenities infrastructure combined with add-on infrastructure) will be identified \nand capacity building assistance provided to the relevant PRIs in structuring \nthese  from  concept  to  final  bid  process.  This  will  demonstrate  the  practical \napplication of the PPP modality developed under the PURA framework. Financial \nclosure can also be facilitated through the process. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $1.875 million equivalent, of which $1.5 million \nequivalent  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the \nGovernment of Japan. The Government of India will provide $375,000 equivalent to finance the \nlocal currency cost to cover counterpart staff, office facilities, administrative support, facilitation \nfor  meetings,  and  other  expenses.  The  detailed  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan  are  in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) PPP Cell will be the Executing Agency. \nMORD  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency.  A  steering  committee,  to  be  chaired  by  a  joint \nsecretary at DEA, will be established and have representatives from ADB, DEA, and MORD. \nOne person from the private sector, to be selected by DEA, will also be invited to steering \ncommittee meetings, to be held at least once every 6 months, with the mandate of providing \nimplementation guidance and oversight to TA implementation. An implementation committee, to \nbe chaired by a joint secretary at MORD, will also be established and have representatives from \nparticipating state governments, related departments, and selected developers of pilot projects. \nIt will hold review meetings at least once every quarter. The TA will support MORD at the central \nlevel by providing consulting teams to undertake components 1\u20133 and separate teams for \ncomponent 4 projects. Component 4 will aim to support the development of PURA pilot projects \nin selected PRIs. These will be selected in conjunction with MORD and DEA and limited to \nthose states participating in previous ADB PPP assistance programs as noted in paragraph 12 \nabove.  Disbursements  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook.17 \n \n15.  Components 1\u20133 will be supported through the engagement of one team or association \nof consultants with expertise in rural sector program and management information system \n                                                 \n16 This activity is expected to commence at the same time as component 2. \n17 ADB. 2008.

While an individual international PPP \nsector expert will be engaged to incorporate international best practices into policy, an individual \nnational communications specialist will assist MORD in developing a communication and public \nawareness strategy, and another individual national project management specialist will assist \nADB in coordinating project management and assessing the progress achieved. Component 4 \naims  at  developing  four  PPP  pilot  projects  in  selected  PRIs  for  which  separate  teams  of \nconsultants  with  specific  experience  in  PPP  transaction  structuring  will  be  engaged.  An \ninception report will be required within 1 month of the start of each assignment. Interim progress \nreports on milestones achieved will be prepared every 6 months. A draft final report for the \nassignment covering components 1\u20134 will be prepared within 2 months prior to completion of \nassignment. Interim project reports, laying out the intended PPPs and financial structure for \napproval; draft project information memoranda; and related bid documents will be submitted for \neach of the pilot projects under component 4.  \n \n16.  Recruitment of teams of consultants will be undertaken through the engagement of \nindividual consultants or a firm (or association of firms) for components 1\u20133 such that specialist \nskills required for the component activities are attained. These will include (i) financial and \ncommercial  structuring  expertise,  (ii)  legal  skills,  (iii)  policy  development  experience,  (iv) \nmanagement information system expertise, (v) training and project management skills, and (vi) \nsocial safeguard expertise. One or more consulting firms may be chosen for component 4, \ndepending upon the depth of consultant expertise in this specialist sector in India. A PPP sector \nexpert,  communications  specialist,  and  project  management  specialist  will  be  recruited \nindividually.  All  procurement  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time), and any selection of consulting firms will be \nthrough  a  simplified  technical  proposal  or  a  biodata  technical  proposal  and  quality-  and  \ncost-based  selection.  A  fixed  quality  cost  ratio  of  80:20  will  be  applied  to  consulting  firm \nselection.  Lump  sum  payments  will  be  made  per  milestones  achieved.  Recruitment  of \nconsultants will be done by ADB in consultation with the Government. \n \n17.  The Government and participating state governments will provide office space, furniture, \nand all administrative support necessary to implement the TA. Equipment and materials to be \nfinanced  by  the  TA  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). At the end of the TA, the procured equipment will belong to the \nlocal bodies using them. Implementation will last 36 months, from October 2009 to September \n2012. The steering committee will disseminate TA results, and TA evaluation results will be \nmade publicly available on the ADB website. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n18.
