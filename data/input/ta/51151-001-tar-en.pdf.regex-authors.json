INTRODUCTION \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) will strengthen health cooperation in the Greater Mekong \nSubregion (GMS).1 Many GMS countries prioritize limited resources for national investments, \nrather than integrating regional components into national programs, and fail to collaborate for the \ncommon  good.  This  is  partly  because  existing  cooperation  mechanisms 2  are  not  fully \ninstitutionalized, there is a paucity of integrated strategies for health cooperation, and countries \nhave weak knowledge of, and insufficient experience in, cooperation. To address these issues, \nthe TA supports a working group on health cooperation (WGHC), which will develop, endorse, \nand implement a GMS health cooperation strategy. The TA also promotes knowledge exchange \nand capacity development.3 \n \n2.  The TA is aligned with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Operational Plan for Regional \nCooperation and Integration (2016\u20132020),4 the GMS Strategic Framework, 2012\u20132022,5 and the \nOperational Plan for Health, 2015\u20132020.6  \n3.  The TA serves as a common platform for the GMS health portfolio. It will synergize with \nthe GMS Health Security Project7 and other ADB projects on disease control and regional \ncollaboration supporting Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Myanmar, \nand Viet Nam.8 This TA broadens the scope beyond disease control and expands the range of \nstakeholders to  include Thailand  and  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  development \npartners, and nongovernment organizations. This increases opportunities for member countries \nto draw upon multiple funding sources to finance commonly agreed-upon projects, publicly \ndocumented in the regional investment framework.9 Whereas existing regional networks are not \nnecessarily government-led and focus on specific diseases, and has limited implementation \ncapacity,  this  TA  supports  exploration  and  implementation  of  any  health  agenda  requiring \ncooperation, including issues raised by non-health sectors. The TA follows recommendations \nmade under earlier TA (supporting a working group on human resource development)10 to form a \nworking  group  for  health  only, 11  given  demonstrated  experience  and  potential  from \ncollaboration.12 Compared with other donors, ADB\u2019s long involvement in GMS and expertise in \n                                                \n1  GMS countries are Cambodia; the People's Republic of China (PRC), specifically Yunnan Province and Guangxi \nZhuang Autonomous Region; the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR); Myanmar; Thailand; and Viet Nam. \n2  Existing Regional Networks and Their Complementarity with the Working Group on Health Cooperation (accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 3) gives an overview of existing regional mechanisms, their focus areas, \nand complementarity with the working group on health cooperation. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 6 September 2017. \n4  ADB. 2016.

Manila. \n ", "2 \nmultisector development lends a comparative and first-mover advantage to the coordination of a \nregional public goods framework that deals with public health threats. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  High communicable disease incidence and drug resistance hamper achievement of \nSustainable Development Goals. Economic development in the GMS has resulted in improved \nhealth outcomes, as measured by the Sustainable Development Goals. Between 2000 and 2015, \nunder-5 deaths (per 1,000 live births) were reduced by 73% in Cambodia, 43% in the Lao PDR, \n39% in Myanmar, and 35% in Viet Nam. Maternal mortality dropped by 67% in Cambodia and by \n20%  in  Thailand.13 However,  the  incidence  of  communicable  diseases  (especially  malaria, \ntuberculosis, and dengue) remains significant. About 71% of the population in Myanmar and half \nthe population of the Lao PDR still live in malaria risk areas, and border zones such as the western \npart of Yunnan province remain vulnerable.14 Drug resistance threatens the regional goal of \neliminating malaria by 2030. Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam also appear on the \nWorld Health Organization (WHO) list of countries with a high tuberculosis burden.15 Moreover, \nSoutheast Asia has 35% of the global burden of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.16 \n5.  Health systems lack synergies and economies of scope. Countries currently do not \nmaximize  economic  and  social  benefits  from  regional  cooperation.  By  working  together, \neconomies of scope could be realized, such as through patient referrals across borders. This is \nespecially important in the GMS, where increasingly interconnected economies aid mobility17 and \nmigrants need continuity of treatment to avoid complications and worsening drug resistance. \nSimilarly,  controlling  infectious  outbreaks  calls  for  stronger  communication  and  information \nsharing, as well as proactive and reactive rapid response involving multiple actors. Finding \ncommon solutions for common problems can lead to innovations, effective technology transfer, \nincreased fundraising leverage, stronger regional identity, and positive externalities. \n \n6.  Limited resources for health do not prioritize regional components. Spending for \nhealth from the domestic envelope is limited, and external sources decrease as countries \ngraduate into a higher-income category. Since countries rationally prioritize national investments \nfor  health,  public  goods  provision  diminishes.  One  study  finds  that  of  the  total  overseas \ndevelopment assistance on research and development for diseases of poverty provided by the \nGroup of Seven (G7) in 2013, only 21% was spent on regional functions, while the rest financed \nnational health priorities.18 Such figures are also reflected in the WHO\u2019s core budget for outbreak \nand crisis response, which halved between 2012\u20132013 and 2014\u20132015, and contributed to its \nslow response to the Ebola crisis.19 \n7.  Collective  action  problem  deters  regional  health  investments.  Communicable \ndisease control (CDC) is classed as a public good, characterized by non-excludability and non-\nrivalry. Non-excludability means that, once CDC is provided, no country can be excluded from \n                                                \n13 ADB. 2017. Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific, 2017.

These characteristics give rise \nto free-riding effects, where countries do not want to invest individually and bear the cost while \nothers reap \u201cfree\u201d benefits. Consequently, public goods such as CDC are undersupplied.  \n8.  Lack  of  strategy  and  work  plans  for  regional  health  cooperation.  Still  little  is \ndocumented and strategized on how best to work together for the common good. While countries \nhave signed up to strategies such as the Asian Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases and \nInternational Health Regulations, these are solely related to CDC, and countries require more \nsupport to achieve cross-country policy coherence and synchronization across the health system. \nAn integrated regional strategy, which uses as its base national health strategies, would assist in \nthis endeavor. National health strategies serve as an entry point in formulating regional work plans \nand sustainable financing proposals. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: healthy lives ensured and well-being for all \nat all ages promoted (Sustainable Development Goal 3).20 The TA will have the following outcome: \nregional health cooperation in GMS strengthened.21 \n10.  Output  1:  GMS  working  group  on  health  cooperation  functioning.  This  output \nsupports the functioning of a GMS WGHC to provide a governance platform to address the \ncollective action problem. The WGHC agrees on a singular vision, and terms of reference, scope \nof work, membership, and reporting agreements.22 The WGHC core group is formed of project \ndirectors from the existing GMS Health Security Project and senior officials from key Ministry of \nHealth departments. WGHC members are nominated for 3 years, with any changes in nomination \nendorsed by other members. Noncore members may include members from other ministries and \ndevelopment partners. The WGHC will explore ways to institutionalize regional cooperation (for \nexample, a permanent government staff position to carry out regional cooperation work) and \ndevelop a memorandum of understanding on areas of collaboration. High-level WGHC activities \nwill be supplemented by evidence-generating national or regional workshops and joint simulation \nexercises, especially at border areas, with a view to systemizing cooperation in the event of an \noutbreak. The TA will provide secretariat support based in GMS countries to streamline regional \ncooperation\u2014including effective information exchange\u2014into the daily work of health ministries. \nWhere relevant, links with existing GMS working groups such as those on Transport and Trade \n(cross-border movement), Agriculture (zoonosis), and Environment (climate change) will be \nforged through extensive consultation and possibly joint projects. \n11.  Output 2: GMS health cooperation strategy developed and implemented. This output \nwill use the WGHC to finalize a 5-year country-endorsed health cooperation strategy documenting \nthe shared challenges, common vision, and strategic pillars (footnote 22). Mainstreaming gender \nwill be central to the strategy to establish a regional public health agenda that ensures active \nparticipation by and benefits for women. The WGHC will formulate time-bound work plans to \nimprove service delivery and increase access for vulnerable groups, including a monitoring and \nevaluation section. To optimize current portfolios and serve as a medium-term regional framework \n                                                \n20 United Nations. 2015.

Manila (TA 9416-REG). \n ", "4 \nfor future assistance, including cofinancing, the strategy will comprise a costed investment \npipeline, also reflected in the Regional Investment Framework 2022 (footnote 9). \n12.  Output 3: Knowledge development and exchange promoted. This output will build \ncapacity of policymakers and encourage countries to share best practices on topics of common \ninterest. Knowledge outputs will directly link to strategic pillars contained in the health cooperation \nstrategy. During implementation, the WGHC and ADB will explore partnerships, especially with \nacademic institutions based in the GMS, to produce high-quality research pieces for evidence-\nbased policymaking. The WGHC secretariat will provide technical support, and in conjunction with \nthe GMS Secretariat based in Regional Cooperation and Operations Coordination Division \n(SERC), upload learning portals on the GMS website.23 \n13.  While the secretariat and WGHC will invite development partners to work together, \ninsufficient development partner financing for health coordination is outside the control of the TA. \n \nB.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1 million, of which (i) $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6); and (ii) $500,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund.24 The Regional Cooperation \nand Integration Fund will finance TA operational expenses in the form of consulting services and \nrelated goods and activities. It will not be used for civil works, procurement of large-scale \nequipment, and permanent staffing costs. Key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  ADB will administer the TA and select, supervise, and evaluate consultants, and help \norganize workshops.25 ADB staff will act as resource persons at workshops, with travel costs \ncharged to the TA.26 In each country, one or more departments of the respective health ministry \nwill act as implementing agency or agencies, as shown in the table below.
