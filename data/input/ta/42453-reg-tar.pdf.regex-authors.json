INTRODUCTION \n1.  Most of the water service providers in many South Asian cities place greater focus on \naugmentation  and  creation  of  new  assets  than  rehabilitation  of  existing  systems.  Routine \noperations do not include regular systemic analyses needed to evaluate performance in an \nurban area, such as assessments of operational efficiency, quality, service level, or consumer \nsatisfaction.  The  supply  of  water  is  often  intermittent,  with  no  strategies  to  make  water \ncontinuously available (24 hours per day, 7 days per week), which is one of the most important \nobjectives in any urban water management system. Intermittent water supplies are the norm \nrather  than  the  exception,  and  problems  associated  with  the  intermittent  supply  of  water \nundermine  urban  water  security  (resulting  in  problems  such  as  water  contamination  and \nwastage at all stages, unreliable metering, and possibly burst pipes due to the development of \nhydraulic water hammers). Many service providers in South Asian cities report high per capita \nlevels of water consumption (over 200 liters per capita per day), despite restricted supply hours, \nindicating the fundamental problem is inefficient management of available water, rather than raw \nwater shortages. \n \n2.  Proper assessment, planning, and management of water-related issues requires reliable \ndata on critical factors related to urban water security. Adequate monitoring of the impact or \ndevelopment results of water-related interventions (including policies, programs, or projects) is \nmade difficult, however, by inconsistent and biased results stemming from the use of differing (i) \ndefinitions and formats for gathering data; and (ii) processes for collection, aggregation, and \nanalysis of data. To improve the performance of urban water management, water security in \nSouth Asian urban centers needs to be properly assessed, and reliable information shared. \n \n1\n3.  The proposed technical assistance (TA) on Achieving Urban Water Security for South \nAsia is included in the regional cooperation operations business plan  2009\u20132010.2. The TA is \nclassified as category B. Critical issues and the necessary information have been identified \nbased on (i) the experience of Asian Development Bank (ADB)-financed projects in the past \nseveral years, (ii) recommendations of the Asian Water Development Outlook 2007 (AWDO \n2007),3 and (iii) continuous consultations with various executing and/or implementing agencies \ninvolved in the implementation of ADB financed urban water supply projects in South Asia. \nSufficient information was collected to allow TA processing to proceed without fielding a fact-\nfinding mission.4  The TA recipient countries (India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka) were consulted in \nwriting and the recipient governments' no objection on the TA are obtained. The TA design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  One of the fundamental constraints to economic development and better livelihoods for \ncitizens of urban centers in South Asia is the inadequate and intermittent supply of safe drinking \nwater. In recent years many developing countries in South Asia have come to understand this \nconstraint and begun placing greater emphasis on urban water security, which is defined as the \nprovision of safe, sustainable, equitable, and adequate drinking water to all urban citizens. \nSpecifically, this involves:  \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 17 March 2009. \n2  ADB. 2008.

Manila.  \n4  Memo (27 February 2009) endorsed by DG/SARD \n ", "2   \n \n(i)  providing reliable, continuously available piped water supply through household \nconnections; \n(ii)  ensuring drinking water conforms to acceptable quality standards; \n(iii)  maximizing  operational  efficiencies  and  have  a  proper  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) system in place; \n(iv)  having an economically viable, rational, and affordable tariff structure; \n(v)  protecting and managing ground and/or surface water sources effectively; \n(vi)  managing demand for drinking water efficiently; \n(vii)  enforcing  accountability,  stakeholder  participation,  and  transparency  in \noperations; \n(viii)  ensuring waste water management as it affects downstream waterbodies and \naquifers; \n(ix)  using alternate methods such as rainwater harvesting, groundwater recharge, \nused water recycling, and desalination wherever feasible; and \n(x)  coordinating with other water use requirements such as irrigation and industry, \nand energy, food, and environmental policies. \n \n5.  Massive capital investments are required to achieve urban water security, but the water \nsector in South Asian countries does not currently generate sufficient surpluses to allow for \nupgrading of ageing infrastructure or addition of new assets to meet increasing demand. For \nservice providers, the negative or low surpluses are coupled with a dependence on government \ntransfers, but are insufficient to sustain asset improvements, resulting in poor service delivery.  \n \n6.  Poor drinking water quality resulting from polluted water sources or intermittent water \nsupplies is a key concern in South Asian cities. Water source development in many South Asian \ncities  exhibits  a  common  pattern:  groundwater  is  overexploited,  thereby  lowering  the \ngroundwater table and causing cities to shift to surface water as an alternative water source. \nThis shift in source exacerbates the situation, as water resources become continuously depleted \nor polluted. At the same time, high levels of residue pesticides, heavy metals and other toxic \nchemicals resulting from agricultural and industrial practices have adversely affected the water \nquality of many South Asian cities. Failure to address water pollution at the source means that \nlarge-scale programs and action plans are ultimately needed to rehabilitate degraded streams \nand depleted aquifers, often at huge cost. Systemic quality monitoring of ground and surface \nwater sources is rarely undertaken, especially of those sources used as water supply intakes. \nMany local governments fail to recognize the importance of water quality, and transfer huge \neconomic costs from water pollution to the national economy. \n \n7.  In addition, systemic reduction of nonrevenue water (NRW) is not undertaken as a \nconscious strategy in many Asian urban areas, even though it is one of the most critical and \ndesirable interventions for improving water security. Deficiencies and lack of metering (bulk or \nindividual) make the proper assessment of water production and consumption and examination \nof NRW and operational efficiencies difficult. Regular O&M does not include leak detection and \nreplacement of leaking, worn-out, corroded, and polluted pipelines. Some electro-mechanical \nequipment (e.g., pumps and motors) is worn out and energy inefficient. Water operators rarely \nconduct asset inventories and there is an absence of accurate spatial (e.g., digital maps of \npipelines)  and  attribute  (e.g.,  characteristics  of  pipelines)  databases.  Water  audits  are  not \ngenerally used to assess NRW. \n \n8.  AWDO 2007 provides insights on achieving water security for Asia and the Pacific. One \nof its key findings is that sufficient knowledge, technology, and expertise is available in the \n ", "  3\nregion to mitigate future urban water crises, but that this should be supported by adequate and \nappropriate water governance, and proper management practices, institutional arrangements \nand sociopolitical conditions. AWDO 2007 recommends: (i) enhancement of skills and capacity \nand development of innovative approaches to foster new mindsets and new partnerships to \nimprove water sector governance; (ii) better management of water quality in connection with \nhealth, social and economic advancement; (iii) rationalization of tariffs, keeping in mind the \nrationale of economic viability and generation of sufficient surpluses to cover O&M costs; and (iv) \nimproved  availability  and  reliability  of  relevant  data  on  physical,  social,  economic,  and \nenvironmental  factors  and  composite  indicators.  Accelerating  urbanization  has  made \nmanagement of the entire water cycle in the urban context a priority.  \n \n9.  As pointed out in AWDO 2007, if a water crisis occurs in the future, it will probably not be \ncaused by an actual physical scarcity of water, as many predict at present, but because of \ncontinuing neglect of proper water management practices. Continuation of present trends will \nresult  in  increasing  contamination  of  available  water  sources,  and  will  increase  the  cost, \ncomplexity  and  management  difficulties  of  providing  clean  water.  Given  this  paramount \nchallenge, the proposed TA will focus on the important underpinnings of urban water security in \nselected South Asian urban centers by helping to (i) evaluate the current situation, (ii) generate \ninformation for policy decisions, (iii) formulate action plans, and (iv) implement such action plans \nfor better governance to achieve water security.  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the TA will be enhanced economic opportunities and reduced waterborne \ndiseases  in  South  Asian  urban  centers  through  improved  water  security,  such  as  better \nunderstanding of service areas and coverage, improved water quality, increased operational \nefficiency, and better O&M of drinking water supply systems.  The outcome of the TA will be (i) \nincreased  understanding  of  key  policy  parameters  for  water  security  and  water  sector \ngovernance; and (ii) reduced risks and vulnerabilities caused by lack of understanding in water-\nrelated knowledge; technology; and expertise in water sector governance and management in \nSouth Asian urban areas in India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  Urban water security is a broad concept, as defined in para. 4. Given the scale of water \nsecurity  challenges  in  South  Asia  and  the  limited  resources  available  under  the  TA,  it  is \nimportant to limit the scope of the TA to the most important and critical issues. The following key \nissues are identified for detailed study in a maximum of 30 selected urban centers under the TA: \n \n(i)  Coverage.  Extent  of  service  area  (geographical  and  population)  coverage, \nintermittent versus continuous (24 hour/day, 7 day/week) water supply coverage, \npiped water supply coverage, etc.  \n(ii)  Quality. Supply of drinking water conforming to acceptable quality standards, \nand  issues  of  wastewater  management  where  these  affect  the  quality  of \ngroundwater and/or downstream aquifers and/or waterbodies.  \n(iii)  NRW reduction, operational efficiencies, and O&M system. Assessment of \nthe level of NRW, of operational efficiencies, and of the O&M system (involving \nO&M costs, revenues from user charges, tariff structures, etc.).  \n ", "4   \n \n12.  Following key outputs are expected: \n \n(i)  The  status  of  and  problems  and/or  constraints  relating  to  the  three  issues \nidentified in para. 11 will be analyzed, and time-bound action plans prepared for \neach  urban  center,  which  specify  the  resources  required  to  achieve  desired \noutcomes. \n(ii)  Based on the studies of the selected urban centers, a generalized conceptual \nframework  will  be  developed  to  assess  and  evaluate  water  security  that  is \napplicable to any urban center.   \n(iii)  Based on the studies of the selected urban centers, monitorable indicators for \nwater security and vulnerability will be developed for use in assessment of water \nsecurity in any urban center. A model for intercity comparison with a composite \nindex (if possible) will also be developed. \n(iv)  A  detailed  case  study  report  for  selected  cities  will  be  prepared,  including \nphysical as well as social, economic, and environmental factors affecting efficient \nwater  planning  and  management.  The  impact  of  ADB  projects  on  the \nimprovement of water security will be examined and included in the report for the \nselected cities in which ADB-financed projects were or are being implemented.  \n(v)  Special consideration will be given to the measurement and management of \nwater quality, as past projects have typically emphasized quantity over quality. A \nreview of policies, regulations, and practices for water quality management will \nbe undertaken. \n(vi)  Synergy will be established with ongoing capacity-building programs under water \nsector projects in India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka to increase awareness of water \nsecurity and vulnerability assessment. \n(vii)  Multimedia  products  will  be  prepared  to  promote  experience  sharing  and \ndissemination of knowledge to subregional, national, local, and project levels.  \n(viii)  Detailed terms of reference and recommendations for future water supply and \nsanitation projects to be financed with ADB assistance will be formulated. The \nterms of reference will be included in the request for proposals for contractors \nthat  will  implement  NRW-reduction  and  water  quality-enhancement  programs \nunder ADB loan projects. \n   \n13.  The following key activities will be undertaken: \n \n(i)  Quality  assessments,  involving  taking  a  sufficient  number  of  samples,  with \ntesting performed at standard laboratories. \n(ii)  NRW assessments will be conducted in all the selected urban centers. \n(iii)  Equipment efficiency (e.g., of electro-mechanical machinery in drinking water \nsystems) will be assessed in all urban centers by expert agencies. \n(iv)  Vulnerability assessment studies will be undertaken that include collection of \nrelevant data, surveys, seminars, pilot project cases, trainings, and forums for \nsharing best practices, good pilot schemes, and knowledge. \n \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $850,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on \na grant basis by the Investment Climate Facilitation Fund5 under the Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration Financing Partnership Facility, and administered by ADB.  \n \nD.
