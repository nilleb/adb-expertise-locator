The transaction involves the administration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of an \nequity investment of up to $3,000,000, with an initial investment of up to $750,000 in a non-\noperating holding company called Financial Wellness Holdings Pte. Ltd. (Wagely) in Singapore \nto expand its operations in Indonesia (conducted through its operating Indonesian subsidiary, PT \nGaji Pintar Indonesia), to be provided by the ADB Ventures Investment Fund 11 under the ADB \nVentures Financing Partnership Facility. The balance of the approved equity amount may be \ninvested in subsequent fundraising rounds that Wagely is expected to undertake. Consistent with \nthe establishment arrangements for the fund, ADB will not invest its own capital alongside the \nfund.2 \n \n2.  Wagely is a financial technology (fintech) company with primary operations in Indonesia \nthat partners with employers to deliver financial wellness to employees by helping them overcome \nfinancial shortfalls between paychecks. Earned wage access enables employees to access their \nearned but unpaid wages, allowing them to be financially resilient when faced with income \nshocks.3 Wagely will also offer financial literacy training to raise awareness around financial risk \nmanagement and ways to deal with shocks, including climate-related shocks. Wagely\u2019s mission \nto increase the financial inclusion of low-and-middle-income workers in Indonesia aligns with \nADB\u2019s operational priorities of achieving greater financial inclusion and building climate and \ndisaster resilience in Asia and the Pacific.4  \n \n  THE INVESTMENT \n \n  Project Identification and Description \n \n3.  High financial exclusion and climate vulnerability. More than 50% of Indonesians are \nexcluded from the formal financial system and only 18% of Indonesian women have borrowed \nfrom a financial institution or used a credit card.5 This number includes many of the 140 million \nlow- and middle-income workers (72% of the Indonesian workforce) who live from paycheck to \npaycheck6 and are highly vulnerable to shocks, including climate-related shocks.7 Indonesia, \nparticularly the island of Java, is prone to a high frequency of floods every year.8 These risks are \nexpected to increase further because of climate change.9 Further, despite the expansion of \nIndonesia\u2019s social protection program, a significant portion of the population still suffer from limited \ncoverage, poor targeting, inadequate benefits, and a lack of integration with social security and \nsocial insurance schemes. Many Indonesians therefore are not covered by any social protection \n \n1  Financing partner: Clean Technology Fund, Nordic Development Fund, and the governments of Finland and the \nRepublic of Korea.

Low financial literacy rates heighten risks. A survey in 2019 found the financial literacy \nrate in Indonesia to be only 38%.11 Another survey in 2017 found that financial literacy rates are \nhigher among men (33% compared with 25% among women).12 Lack of financial experience and \nwithout access to formal credit providers, many Indonesians opt to take out loans from fast-cash \nlenders\u2014leaving them vulnerable to unreasonably high interest rates (1% per day) and predatory \ncollection practices that are detrimental to their long-term financial health. Low levels of financial \nliteracy make it difficult for the financially excluded to cope with income shocks, including climate-\nrelated shocks. Financial literacy, together with increased awareness and knowledge of climate \nrisk and resilience solutions, can play a critical role in influencing household decisions on investing \nin resilient assets and livelihoods, and improved preparedness planning.13  \n \n5.  Fintech industry in Indonesia. Indonesia\u2019s large and digitally savvy population, many of \nwhom are financially underserved, has accelerated the growth of the fintech industry. The \nemerging fintech industry has fostered innovations with the objective of increasing financial \ninclusion, but it has also made financial products and services that have heightened risks to \nconsumers.14 For example, the market has a high number of peer-to-peer and payday loan \nproducts, often charging high interest rates, that pose risks to consumers with low levels of \nfinancial literacy. The Financial Services Authority (OJK) of Indonesia is closely scrutinizing \nfintech lenders and promoting increased digital financial literacy, particularly for women, to \nmitigate consumer risks.15 \n \n6.  Business strategy and rationale. Wagely is a first mover in the $2.1 billion earned wage \naccess market in Indonesia. Its mission is to provide a sustainable solution for all employees by \nbreaking the cycle of debt caused by overdraft fees, high-interest credit, and payday loans; and \nto play a leading role in building financial wellness for low- and middle-income workers in \nIndonesia. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. Through partnerships with employers, \nWagely is designing a holistic platform that will help employees to overcome financial shortfalls \nbetween paychecks through on-demand access to earned wages, while offering financial literacy \neducation to promote healthy financial planning habits. Overtime increased financial literacy levels \nwill enable employees to access a broader range of financial product offerings, including saving \nand insurance, that will reduce their vulnerabilities to economic and climate shocks. Increased \nfinancial  wellness  of  employees  will  also  generate  financial  benefits  for  Wagely\u2019s  partner \nemployers  through  increased  productivity,  reduced  turnover  costs,  and  higher  retention  of \nworkers. Wagely\u2019s solution can be implemented by employers in 48 hours and allows employees \nto access earned wages within 24 hours of applying. Recognizing a gender gap, Wagely will \nintroduce tailored financial products for women that will be promoted through women-focused \nmarketing campaigns.  \n \n  Ownership and Management \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n10 ADB. 2020.

The management team consists of founders and other experienced and \nwell-qualified professionals; has a record of entrepreneurial success; and is well-connected in \nprime market segments for financial services, including fintech and e-commerce.

Sasanadi Ruka has over 15 years of software development experience in \nvarious technology and financial service companies in Indonesia. Kevin Hausburg co-founded a \ndigital marketing and design agency serving enterprise clients in over 10 countries. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n  THE ADB ASSISTANCE \n \n  The Assistance \n \n8.  ADB will administer the provision of assistance by the fund of up to $3,000,000, with an \ninitial investment of up to $750,000 through an equity investment in Financial Wellness Holdings \nPte. Ltd.  \n \n9.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. The balance of the approved equity amount \nmay be invested in subsequent fundraising rounds. ADB is expected to provide support to help \nstrengthen governance, improve environmental and social sustainability, incorporate measures \nto support gender equality in Wagely\u2019s business activities to narrow gender disparities, achieve \ngreater financial inclusion, strengthen awareness on climate and disaster risk, building climate \nand  disaster  resilience  and  help  in  building  financial  literacy  modules.  This  investment  is \ncomplimentary to ADB\u2019s sovereign operations and ADB aims to leverage its networks to help \nWagely connect with regulators and new customers, and gain traction in other Southeast Asian \nmarkets.16 In line with the ADB Ventures Financing Partnership Facility, the share purchase price \nwill be based on a valuation approved by the fund investment committee. \n \n  Implementation Arrangements \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n10.  Use of proceeds. Wagely will use the investment proceeds to finance its business growth \nin Indonesia by expanding its products suite and team to improve both engineering and sales \ncapabilities, including hiring for senior management to accelerate growth. \n \n \n  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n11.  Development of fintech industry in Indonesia. The investment will demonstrate ADB\u2019s \nsupport of innovative financial technologies  that strengthen financial inclusion in Indonesia. \nEarned wage access will provide a default pathway for emergency funding and help low- and \nmiddle-income people break out of the cycle induced by predatory lending. This is crucial as the \nexpected increase in climate and disaster risk has a disproportionate impact on low- and middle-\nincome people. Hence, financial literacy and climate awareness training will help vulnerable \npopulations to become financially resilient by providing them opportunities to save and insure. \n \n \n16 ADB. 2020.

ADB\u2019s shareholding is anticipated to have a significant signaling \neffect and is likely to increase market confidence in Wagely achieving its business goals. This will \nhelp Wagely in critical areas, such as launching new products and attracting future debt and \nequity. ADB\u2019s investment will also help catalyze more impact venture investments in Indonesia. \n \n13.  Progress to market-leading standards. As the first and only development finance \ninstitution shareholder, ADB will help develop and support Wagely\u2019s adherence to high corporate \ngovernance  and  integrity  standards,  as  well  as  its  adoption  of  market-leading  social  and \nenvironmental standards, with potential demonstration effects in the Indonesian fintech segment. \nADB will also add value to Wagely by helping to link climate change awareness to financial literacy \ntraining.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \n  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n14.  The investment is aligned with the Government of Indonesia\u2019s commitment to increase \nfinancial inclusion17 and achieve Sustainable Development Goals 1, 8 and 13.18 The investment\u2019s \nexpected outcome is increased financial inclusion and reduced climate vulnerabilities, among \nothers, for low- and middle-income workers, particularly for women due to increased availability \nof earned wage access. The expected outputs of the investment are (i) the expansion of Wagely\u2019s \nbusiness in a gender inclusive manner, (ii) increased availability of women-focused financial \nproducts and marketing, (iii) enhanced gender equality in decision-making, (iv) enhanced gender \nequality in staffing, and (v) enhanced gender equality in the workplace. \n \n  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n15.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The investment is compliant \nwith the fund\u2019s objectives, as set out in the relevant contractual documents.19 In addition, the \ninvestment will contribute to the following Strategy 2030 operational priorities and their operational \nplans: (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities (OP1); (ii) accelerating progress \nin gender equality (OP2); and (iii) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, \nand enhancing environmental sustainability (OP3).20 The investment is also aligned with the \nobjective of the ADB country partnership strategy and country operations business plan in \nIndonesia of addressing climate change, increasing climate resilience, and gender equality.21 \n \n \n17 Government of Indonesia. 2020.

ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009) as follows: environment (category C), involuntary resettlement (category C), \nand indigenous peoples (category C).22 \n \n17.  ADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social \nimpacts of the investment. Wagely\u2019s business operations and plan for using ADB proceeds are \nlikely  to  have  minimal  adverse  effects  to  the  environment  and  will  not  trigger  involuntary \nresettlement or indigenous people\u2019s safeguards. \n \n18.  As a digital business, Wagely\u2019s operations and activities are expected to consume \nelectricity and generate minimal waste. Energy consumption and waste generation could be \nmanaged through standard regulations and resource conservation measures. Wagely\u2019s current \npolicies and procedures may be strengthened to ensure that the company\u2019s current and future \nenvironmental and social impacts are managed, with a view to minimizing any potential harm. \nThe investment is expected to increase economic opportunities in Indonesia by creating 50 new \njobs in technical and nontechnical roles. Wagely commits to adhere to applicable labor laws and \ninternationally recognized core labor standards. Wagely will report to ADB annually on such \ncompliance.23 \n \n19.  Gender equity as a theme. Following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998), \nWagely has incorporated measures to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment in \nits business activities. Key features of the gender action plan are as follows: (i) increase the \nproportion of women using Wagely\u2019s services, (ii) introduce a financial product that addresses \nwomen\u2019s needs, (iii) develop and implement a women-focused marketing campaign, (iv) increase \nthe number of female board members or senior advisors, (v) increase the number of female \nemployees, (vi) increase the proportion of women in management, (vii) increase the proportion of \nwomen in technical roles, (viii) adopt an anti-sexual harassment policy, (ix) annually train staff on \nWagely\u2019s anti-sexual harassment policy, and (x) train women on climate change awareness, \nsavings  and  insurance.  Wagely  will  submit  periodic  reports  on  implementation  of  gender \nmeasures to ADB. \n \n  Anticorruption Policy \n \n20.  Wagely was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism.
