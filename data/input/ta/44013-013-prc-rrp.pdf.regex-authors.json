I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Shanxi Energy Efficiency and Environment \nImprovement Project.1 \n \n2.  The proposed project will improve energy efficiency and reduce emission of greenhouse \ngases and other pollutants in Shanxi province by introducing and expanding district heating in \nfive urban areas and expanding the coal-mine methane (CMM) gas supply and distribution \nnetwork  in  one  of  these  areas.  The  project  follows  and  complements  two  previous  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) projects in the province, which have been completed successfully. 2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The PRC\u2019s rapid economic growth and its reliance on coal, which provided about 70% of \nprimary  energy  in  2010,  are  causing  continued  rapid  growth  of  harmful  emissions.3  Coal \ncombustion  releases  large  amount  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO ),  the  main  greenhouse  gas \n2\nresponsible for causing climate change.4 Coal combustion also emits sulfur dioxide (SO ) and \n2\nnitrogen oxides (NO ), which are the main causes of acid rain, and total suspended particulates, \nx\nwhich cause serious respiratory diseases. The Government of the PRC has recognized the \nenvironmental challenges posed by the rapid increase in coal consumption and has committed \nto achieve a reduction in carbon intensity of 40%\u201345% by 2020, compared with 2005, primarily \nby targeting reductions in energy intensity.5 During the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, 2006\u20132010, \nthe energy intensity was reduced by 19.1% compared with a target of 20.0%. The Twelfth Five-\nYear Plan, 2011\u20132015 has set the target of reducing energy intensity by a further 16%, carbon \nintensity by 17%, and emissions of SO by 8% and NO  by 10%. Shanxi province has set a \n2  x\ncorresponding  target  of  reducing  energy  intensity  by  16%,  carbon  intensity  by  17%,  and \nemissions of SO  by 11.3% and NO  by 13.9%.6 \n2 x\n \n4.  About half of the PRC\u2019s CO  emissions come from the generation of electricity and heat. \n2\nDemand for centralized heating (or district heating) is growing rapidly along with economic \ndevelopment and urbanization. In 2010, the total quantity of heat supplied in the urban areas of \nthe PRC reached 2.9 billion gigajoules and the total area covered by district heating reached 4.4 \nbillion  square  meters  (m2),  compared  with  1.9  billion  m2  in  2003.  Beijing  and  Tianjin \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. Project preparatory technical assistance was approved on \n14 December 2010 for $550,000 (ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Preparing \nthe Shanxi Energy Efficiency and Environment Improvement Project. Manila [TA 7736-PRC]). \n2  ADB. 1999.

Manila (Loan \n1715-PRC and TA 3325-PRC); and ADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of \nDirectors: Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Coal Mine Methane Development Project. \nManila (Loan 2146-PRC). \n3  The PRC data in this document were taken from the National Bureau of Statistics and Shanxi Statistics Bureau, \nunless quoted otherwise. CO  emissions data were taken from the International Energy Association website while \n2\nthe other emissions data came from the Ministry of Environmental Protection 2011 Annual Report. During the \nEleventh Five-Year Plan period, CO  emissions increased by 60%; SO  and NO emissions rose by 10% and 21%; \n2 2 x \nand TSP emissions decreased by 29%. \n4  One ton of coal combustion on average releases more than 2.4 tons of CO . \n2\n5  Carbon intensity is the amount of greenhouse gas emitted per unit of gross domestic product (GDP), whereas \nenergy intensity is the amount of energy consumed per unit of GDP. \n6  Decree No. 26: Circular of the State Council on Issuing the Comprehensive Work Plan for Energy Conservation \nand Emission Reduction during the Twelfth Five-Year Plan period. ", "2 \nmunicipalities, and 19 provinces in the PRC have adopted district heating. Despite this, district \nheating in the PRC still covers only 30% of the total floor area, compared with about 60% \ncoverage in European countries. In the absence of district heating, inefficient and polluting coal-\nbased household stoves and small neighborhood boilers continue to be widely used. The \ngovernment plans to expand the coverage of district heating, which would allow to close the \nsmall, inefficient heat-only boilers, and increase the use of energy-efficient combined heat and \npower  (CHP)  plants  as  a  heat  source.  District  heating  also  allows  the  introduction  of \nconsumption-based  billing,  which  enables  consumers  to  regulate  the  amount  of  heat  they \nconsume. It avoids significant heat losses in the system, reinforcing the energy efficiency of \ndistrict heating. \n \n5.  Shanxi is an underdeveloped inland province in the PRC\u2019s north-central region. It covers \nan area of about 156,300 square kilometers. The heating season lasts for 5 months and \ntemperatures can fall below \u201320\u00b0C. Shanxi\u2019s gross domestic product per capita in 2010 was \n$4,107 equivalent, which is about 88% of the national average ($4,686). It ranks 18th among \nthe PRC\u2019s provinces. Shanxi is well known for its rich coal resources, estimated at about one-\nthird of the PRC\u2019s total coal reserves. In 2011, it produced 870 million tons of coal, about one-\nfourth of the PRC\u2019s total coal production and an increase of 17.7% over 2010 production. It \nfaces serious pollution and environmental problems that are closely related to the mining, use, \nand transport of coal.7 \n \n6.  The  underground  coal  mines  in  Shanxi  release  large  amounts  of  methane  during \noperation, commonly referred to as CMM.8 The capture and use of CMM not only helps avoid \nserious  mining  accidents  but  provides  large  environmental  and  climate  change  mitigation \nbenefits. ADB supported a CMM project in Jincheng, in one of the largest coal mines in the \nprovince (footnote 2). It was the first such project in the province that demonstrated the twin \nbenefits of greater coal-mine safety by capturing methane and of utilizing the captured methane \nfor electricity generation and as fuel for household consumption. In 2010, more than 2.8 billion \ncubic meters (m3) of CMM was extracted, of which the province utilized about 0.9 billion m3 \n(34%), mainly for residential cooking, transport, commercial and industrial use, and power \ngeneration. Its use for district heating and space cooling has been very limited. The project \nrectifies this by demonstrating CMM utilization for district heating and space cooling in one city. \nIt is also the first ADB initiative to use CMM for such purposes. \n \n7.  Like in many other provinces, Shanxi's rapid urbanization is fuelling demand for housing \nand  urban  infrastructure.9  Likewise,  strong  economic  growth,  higher  incomes,  and  the \nprivatization  of  housing  are  driving  demand  for  district  heating.  Thus,  Shanxi  has  rapidly \nexpanded its coverage of heat supply, from 71.1 million m2 in 2003 to 287.4 million m2 in 2010\u2014\nan annual growth rate of 21%, much higher than the national average of 12%. \n \n8.  Although the high growth rate of Shanxi's heat supply provides significant opportunities \nfor the private sector, private participation has been relatively slow because (i) initial investment \ncosts are high and financial returns low; (ii) local commercial finance institutions are reluctant to \nprovide  debt  financing,  particularly  in  remote  urban  areas  with  small  markets,  because  of \n                                                 \n7  In 2011, about 580 million tons, or about two-thirds of total coal production in Shanxi, were transported outside the \nprovince. \n8  CMM refers to methane released from the coal and surrounding rock strata during mining. Methane is a nontoxic \ncombustible greenhouse gas, about 21 times more potent than CO . In underground mines, the methane is drained \n2\nbefore the mining operation can take place to avoid explosions and injuries to miners. \n9  ADB extended support to Shanxi\u2019s urban sector development through ADB. 2009.

Manila (Loan 2606-PRC). \n ", "3 \nperceived high risks; and (iii) only a handful of private companies have the required technical \nand managerial capacity to operate such utilities, and these tend to focus on large urban areas. \nWhile some of the reforms that will remove most of these barriers are underway, district heating \nas an industry is still not commercially mature and requires public investment to meet growing \ndemand, and thus remains an essential public service in Shanxi. \n \n9.  Due to the abundance of locally produced coal, district heating in Shanxi relies primarily \non coal as a fuel source. Many of the heating systems in urban areas are old and inefficient and \nlack  proper  emission  control  equipment.  Environmental  impacts  from  these  systems  are \ndisproportionately high on the poor and on women. Urban pollution from small boilers worsens \noutdoor  air  quality  and  causes  significant  cumulative  harm  to  public  health.  Inadequate \ncoverage of district heating in low-income urban areas drives residents to use indoor coal \nstoves for heating, a major cause of respiratory diseases. Women and small children are \nparticularly vulnerable to high indoor pollution, as they tend to spend more time indoors. \n \n10.  The project will help solve the issues described above by extending and expanding \nenergy-efficient district heating to more than 270,000 residents in five highly polluted urban \nareas of Shanxi. It will replace small, inefficient, and polluting inner-city coal-fired boilers and \ncoal-fired household stoves with a highly energy-efficient CHP plant and large heat boilers, and \nwith CMM supply, thereby reducing the overall environmental footprints of district heating.10 \nLessons from previous ADB interventions of a similar type were taken into account in the project \ndesign.11 The project has a strong rationale as part of the ongoing energy intensity improvement \nin the PRC, its Energy Conservation Law, and its Energy Conservation Ordinance for Civil \nConstruction. The project is also in line with ADB's country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for \nthe PRC, and its Energy Policy, which prioritizes energy efficiency projects, including district \nheating, and promotes access to energy for all. 12 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The  impact  will  be  greater  energy  efficiency  and  a  cleaner  environment  in  Shanxi \nprovince. The outcome will be better air quality and reduced greenhouse gases emission in five \nurban areas in Shanxi province. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n12.  The project has three parts as described below: \n \n13.  Part  A:  District  heating.  This consists  of  four  district  heating  subprojects  that  will \nrehabilitate 2.9 million m2 of existing heating coverage and extend district heating to another \n3.9 million m2. It will install (i) five large, efficient coal-fired boilers with an aggregate capacity of \n261 megawatt thermal (MWt), which will allow the closure of 232 small, inefficient coal-fired \nboilers with an aggregate capacity of 340 MWt and of 4,000 household heating stoves with an \naggregate capacity of 60 MWt; (ii) a heat transmission and distribution network with 100 heat \n                                                 \n10 Small heat-only boilers operate at 50%\u201360% combustion efficiency compared with 80%\u201390% for new large boilers. \nHousehold heating stoves have an even lower combustion efficiency at only 35%\u201340%. \n11 Summarized  in  Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Energy:  District  Heating  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n12 ADB. 2012.

This will include consulting services, training, and \nequipment and will strengthen the capacity of the executing agency, the project management \noffice  (PMO),  and  the  five  subproject  implementing  agencies  to  supervise  and  manage \nimplementation of the project. This part has been included to incorporate lessons learned from \nprevious  ADB  projects  of  a  similar  type,  whereby  multicomponent  district  heating  projects \nrequire extensive support both for the PMO to manage the subprojects' implementation and \ncollate reports for all subprojects, and for the implementing agencies to ensure compliance with \nsafeguard policies and reporting requirements.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \n20.  Comprehensive due diligence of individual subprojects and the overall project has been \nundertaken.  \n \nA.  Technical \n \n21.  Several options of heat source were considered for the heat supply, including renewable \nenergy, gas-fired boilers, CHP plants, and coal-fired boilers. Technical due diligence showed \nthat renewable sources of heat are not feasible due to technical and/or financial limitations. \nWherever feasible, CHP plants and gas-fired boilers are the preferred heat source. A new CHP \nplant in Jinzhong, financed and built by other owners, has been selected as the source for \ndistrict heating in Jinzhong. The Liulin CMM subproject will use gas-fired boilers. For district \nheating in the cities of Licheng, Qin, and Zhongyang, CHP is not available and large, efficient \ncoal-fired boilers are the only feasible option.17 \n \n22.  Special features. To further boost energy savings and environmental benefits, several \ninnovative technical measures have been adopted for all district heating subprojects: (i) use of \npre-insulated bonded pipe to reduce heat loss, (ii) installation of state-of-the-art technology to \ntrap fly ash and of external flue gas desulfurization devices to remove SO , and (iii) use of \n2\nSCADA systems to monitor the operational parameters and prevent heat loss. In addition, the \nJinzhong district heating subproject will (i) install an energy management center to regulate heat \nsupply and demand, reduce water and electricity consumption, and assess the system\u2019s energy \nconservation  potential  and  suggest  options  to  save  energy;  and  (ii)  use  packaged  heat \nexchange stations, which are compact and more energy efficient than traditional heat exchange \nstations. Successful operation of these innovative, energy-saving measures under the project \ncan be replicated in other places in Shanxi province and the northern PRC. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n23.  Economic analyses of the subprojects indicate that the project is economically viable \nwith economic internal rates of return ranging from 14.4% to 24.6% for part A subprojects, and \n31.3% for the part B subproject, all higher than the 12.0% economic cost of capital. The  of the \nwhole project is 17.9%.18 Financial analyses of the part A subprojects indicate financial internal \nrates of return of between 6.0% and 7.2%, and 19.8% for the part B subproject, all substantially \nhigher than the corresponding weighted average costs of capital.19 The financial internal rate of \nreturn for the whole project is 8.2%, compared with the weighted average cost of capital of \n2.5%.  Sensitivity analysis shows that the project is economically and financially viable under \nvarious adverse scenarios. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n24.  The financial management capacity of the individual implementing agencies has been \nassessed and found to be adequate to ensure that loan funds are utilized for intended purposes. \nSome capacity strengthening is needed for the two newly created implementing agencies. The \nimplementing agencies are responsible for undertaking the procurement of goods and services \nwhile the PMO is responsible for reviewing and approving these procurement activities. The \nprocurement  capacity  assessment  indicates  that  the  PMO  has  experienced  staff  and  has \n                                                 \n17 The technical description of the subprojects is in Appendix 1 of the Project Administration Manual (accessible from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nprevious experience in administering ADB projects. Among the implementing agencies, only the \nJinzhong one has experience in dealing with an international finance organization and has \nexisting project management teams. Both the PMO and the Jinzhong implementing agency \nhave procedures and systems in place to manage procurement that is consistent with ADB \nrequirements. The other implementing agencies have little or no experience in conducting \ninternational competitive bidding and will be trained in various aspects of procurement and \nproject management (para. 15). \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, the Shanxi Provincial Government (SPG), and the implementing agencies. \nThe  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  PAM \n(footnote 16). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n26.  Access to reliable district heating and CMM supply will indirectly benefit more than \n710,000 urban residents in project districts, of which approximately 4.7% are poor.20 Direct \nbeneficiaries will be about 270,000 residents (83,300 households), of which 6.4% are poor; \n100,400 children studying in 51 schools; and patients and medical staff in 17 hospitals.21 The \nincreased use of CMM and the expanded district heating will reduce the use of raw coal, wood, \nand coal briquettes as fuels for indoor heating and cooking, and will benefit public health, \nparticularly the health of the poor and women, who spend most of the time indoors. About \n30,000 households, 2,400 of which are poor, will use CMM for cooking. The poor households, \nincluding  703  headed  by  women,  will  receive  a  70%  heating  tariff  subsidy  from  the  local \ngovernment, under the minimum living standard security program, and have the connection fees \nwaived. By providing cleaner and more reliable heating services, the project will (i) reduce cases \nof respiratory diseases and carbon monoxide poisoning through better quality of indoor and \noutdoor air; (ii) improve living, school, and hospital conditions during winter; (iii) reduce heating \ncosts by switching to centralized, energy-efficient heating systems; and (iv) create 1,758 full-\ntime  jobs  during  construction  and  942  full-time  jobs  during  operation.  The  local  poor  and \nvulnerable people will have more job opportunities and be given priority in hiring. \n \n27.  The project will benefit 339,300 women indirectly, and 133,000 women directly. The \ncentralized heating system will save women about 1 hour per day of the time spent for attending \nto  heating  needs  during  winter.  Women  will  have  equal  opportunities  for  employment  in \navailable positions and will be given priority when hiring heating bill collectors (at least 50%). \nAwareness campaigns focusing on health, safety, and energy conservation, and knowledge-\nsharing  sessions  will  be  organized  with  women\u2019s  federations  in  each  subproject  area,  in \naccordance with the gender action plan.22 \n \n28.  Closure of 275 small, heat-only boilers will affect 401 boiler workers (80 regular full-time \nemployees and 321 seasonal workers with contracts for a single heating season). A labor \nretrenchment plan has been prepared.23 The implementing agencies have agreed to ensure that \nall affected regular employees are reemployed in a timely manner and in accordance with the \nlabor  retrenchment  plan,  and  that  seasonal  workers  will  be  reemployed  where  possible. \nEmployment training will be arranged for all affected workers. \n                                                 \n20 Local residents who will use the district heating and CMM services provided by the subprojects are considered \ndirect beneficiaries, while other local residents, who will not be connected to the system but will benefit from better \nair quality resulting from the project, are considered indirect beneficiaries. \n21 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Labor Retrenchment Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n29.  The project has been classified as environmental category B, involuntary resettlement \ncategory B, and indigenous peoples category C. \n \n30.  Environmental. The project results in substantial environmental benefits by improving \nenergy efficiency and avoiding combustion of 85,390 tons of coal per year, resulting in emission \nreductions of 4,121 tons of SO , 16,234 tons of total suspended particulates, 1,942 tons of NO , \n2 x\nand 254,379 tons of CO .24 The potential adverse environmental impacts from the project \n2\ninclude (i) during construction: noise, soil erosion, and safety risks to community members and \nworkers, including fire and explosion risks posed by working with CMM; (ii) during operation: (a) \ninappropriate handling of waste when decommissioning small boilers; (b) untreated wastewater, \nsolid  and  hazardous  wastes;  (c)  noise  and  air  pollution  from  boiler  stacks  and  from  coal \nhandling, gas emissions and safety risks. The initial environmental examination (IEE) concludes \nthat the potential adverse environmental impacts can be adequately mitigated by measures \noutlined in the IEE, and the project will result in environmental and socioeconomic benefits that \nsignificantly  outweigh  potential  negative  impacts.25  The  project  fully  complies  with  ADB\u2019s \ninformation disclosure and consultation requirements.26 \n \n31.  SPG  and  the  implementing  agencies  shall  ensure  that  the  project  is  designed, \nconstructed,  and  operated  in  accordance  with  the  PRC\u2019s  relevant  national  and  local \nenvironmental  laws,  regulations,  procedures,  and  guidelines;  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009); and the project environmental management plan attached to the IEE. SPG \nwill  ensure  that  the  boilers  constructed  under  the  project  comply  with  PRC  gas  emission \nstandards stipulated in Emission Standard of Air Pollutants for Coal-burning, Oil-burning, Gas-\nfired Boilers (GB 13217-2001)27 and with the World Bank Group\u2019s Environmental, Health, and \nSafety  Guidelines  for  Thermal  Power  Plants.28  Environmental  monitoring  reports  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB twice a year during construction and annually during operation. Closures of \nsmall boilers will be reported annually. The environmental management plan will be updated \nduring  the  engineering  design  and  incorporated  in  the  bidding  documents  and  civil  works \ncontracts. \n \n32.  Land acquisition. Land acquisition under the Liulin CMM subproject will affect people \nand a resettlement plan has been prepared.29 The other subprojects entail no land acquisition, \nrestriction in land use, or structure demolition, as they will be implemented on government land \nor existing premises. The CMM subproject will permanently acquire 24.7 mu (a mu is a Chinese \nunit of measurement, e.g., 15 mu = 1 hectare), of which 15 mu is cultivated land and will affect \n17 people from four households. Of the remaining land, 7.7 mu is wasteland and 2 mu is \nforestry land and will not affect any people. SPG shall ensure that (i) all land and rights-of-way, \nand counterpart funds are provided in a timely manner; (ii) the resettlement plan is implemented \nin accordance with its terms and that compensation and entitlements for affected peoples are \n                                                 \n24 The capture of CMM for use in the project will avoid its release into the atmosphere. This is equivalent to an \nadditional 764,568 tons per year of CO  emissions. \n2\n25 The project IEE was prepared based on domestic environmental assessments for each subproject and supported \nby site visits, stakeholder consultations, and additional surveys by the environment specialists engaged under \nADB\u2019s project preparatory TA for Shanxi Energy Efficiency and Environment Improvement Project. \n26 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 State Environmental Protection Agency. 2001.
