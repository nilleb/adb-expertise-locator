The GMS Cross-Border Transport Agreement (CBTA) was ratified in 2003 by all GMS \ncountries to facilitate the cross-border movement of goods, vehicles, and people between and \namong them. It will enhance connectivity by maximizing the benefits derived from substantial \nsubregional transport infrastructure that is reaching completion. RETA 6307: Implementation of \nthe  GMS  Cross-Border  Transport  Agreement  was  approved  in  March  2006  for  $800,000 \n($400,000 from ADB\u2019s TA funding program, with $400,000 cofinanced by the People\u2019s Republic \nof  China  Regional  Cooperation  and  Poverty  Reduction  Fund).  The  demand  for  activities \nsupported by the RETA has increased and is well beyond the RETA resources. In recognition of \nthe  importance  of  the  CBTA  and  its  timely  implementation,  the  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational Development (AusAID), on behalf of the Government of Australia, has agreed to \ncontribute the equivalent of $1,000,000 supplementary financing for RETA 6307.  \n \n2.  The CBTA has 20 operational annexes and protocols. To date, 16 have been signed and \nthe remaining 4 are expected to be signed in March 2007. Bilateral time-bound Memorandum of \nUnderstanding (MOU) for initial implementation of the CBTA at 7 key border crossings, i.e. 14 \nborders in the GMS have also been signed or finalized (4 border crossings have signed MOUs, \nand 3 others have finalized MOUs). RETA 6307 is supporting the CBTA implementation at \nthese 7 border crossings, including facilitating preparation of the MOUs, and related bilateral \nroad  transport  agreements,  conducting  capacity  building  activities,  preparing  operational \nmanuals for border officials and providing basic information communications technology (ICT) \nequipment for one pilot border checkpoint. \n \n3.  The demand for activities supported by the RETA is well beyond the resources of the \nRETA, especially for ICT equipment. Most of the border crossing checkpoints in GMS countries \nare not equipped with the basic ICT equipment needed to undertake minimum border inspection \nand facilitation activities.  This constrains the effective and timely implementation of the CBTA \nacross  the  Mekong  subregion.  To  overcome  this  impediment,  the  GMS  countries  have \nrequested ADB to mobilize additional financial resources to accelerate the implementation of the \nCBTA while at the same time ensuring appropriate standards are achieved. \n \n4.  To accelerate the implementation of the CBTA at the first 4 borders, AusAID agreed to \nprovide supplementary funds for RETA 6307 and a joint ADB-AusAID mission was fielded in \nSeptember  2006  to  scope  the  activities  that  the  supplementary  funds  would  support.  The \nMission  met  the  chairmen  of  the  National  Transport  Facilitation  Committees  (NTFC)  of \nCambodia, Viet Nam and Lao PDR. The NTFC chairmen all warmly welcomed the AusAID ", "assistance for the CBTA.  The Mission also visited the four borders, namely Lao Bao (Viet \nNam), Dansavanh (Lao PDR), Bavet (Cambodia), and Moc Bai (Viet Nam), to assess the need \nfor ICT equipment and capacity building. The funding support from AusAID will be used to \nsupport  CBTA  activities  that  are not  currently  adequately  covered  by  the  RETA,  including \nincreasing budget for i) ICT equipment and ii) technical expertise for capacity building activities.   \n \n5.  In view of the above, and in accordance with Project Administration Instructions (PAI) No. \n5.11 paragraphs 31 and 39, the President has approved (i) an increase in the TA cost by $1,000, \n000 committed by AusAID on behalf of the Australian Government; and (ii) administration by \nADB of the supplementary grant fund from AusAID.
