It will improve\naccess to quality health services by upgrading health centers in rural\nareas and enhancing the skills of health care service providers. The\nProject will also strengthen the demand for health services through\ntargeted information, education and communication activities, improved\ncommunity  participation,  and  more  equitable  health  financing.  In\nparticular, the Project will support the Government\u2019s scheme to provide\nfree health cards to the poor. The Project will also support preventive\nhealth care by strengthening food safety infrastructure and behavior\nchange communication (BCC) centering on human immunodeficiency\nvirus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), prevention of\ninjuries  and  accidents,  tobacco  use,  malnutrition  and  reproductive\nhealth.  United  Nations  Population  Fund,  United  Nations  Children\u2019s\nFund, and World Health Organization will cofinance the Project on a\nparallel basis.\nClassification Primary objective: Poverty reduction\nSecondary objective: Human development\nEnvironmental Environmental category: C\nAssessment\nEnvironmental implications were reviewed, and no significant adverse\nenvironmental impacts were identified.\nRationale Despite impressive achievements in the health sector, health status\nand the use of health services in Viet Nam remain much poorer in rural\nareas than in urban areas. These inequities are even more stark in\npoor and remote rural areas and those inhabited by ethnic minorities.\nPoor health is both a cause and effect of poverty. Improving the health\nstatus of people in rural areas will substantially contribute to poverty\nreduction. This will require interventions that address both demand-\nand  supply-side  constraints.  More  appropriate  and  better  quality\nservices  need  to  be  provided  in  rural  areas.  Management  and\nsupervision of health services need to be improved. Financial barriers\nto access must also be addressed through supporting innovative health\nfinancing mechanisms. At the same time, there is an urgent need to\npay greater attention to prevention activities, generating demand for\nservices, and ensuring greater community participation in the provision\nof services.\nObjectives and The objective of the proposed Project is to improve the health status\nScope of the rural population, especially the poor and disadvantaged, in 13\nprovinces. The objective will be achieved by (i) promoting access to\nquality primary health care (PHC) services\u2014with special emphasis on", "iii\nimproving the quality of health services for women, children, the poor\nand ethnic minorities\u2014by upgrading preventive and curative health\nstructures, basic equipment, and staff skills; (ii) strengthening overall\nfinancial  management,  facilitating  government  policy  for  providing\nhealth care to the poor, and developing a pilot model for voluntary\nrural  health  insurance;  (iii) improving  the  Ministry  of  Health\u2019s\nmanagement  capacity  to  implement  PHC  programs;  and\n(iv) strengthening  communication  support  to  services\u2014especially\nthose focused on reproductive health, HIV/AIDS, injury prevention,\nsmoking, and nutrition\u2014through community participation.\nThe Project has three components: (i) improving access to quality\ncare;  (ii)  improving  the  health  system;  and  (iii) strengthening\nprevention and community participation.\nCost Estimates The  total  cost  of  the  Project  including  physical  and  price\ncontingencies, and taxes and duties is estimated at $98.7 million\nequivalent. Of this amount, $26.7 million equivalent, or 27 percent of\nthe  total  cost,  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost,  and  $72.0  million\nequivalent, or 73 percent of the total cost, is the local cost.\nFinancing Plan ______________________________________($ million equivalent)__\nSource Foreign Local Total Percent\nExchange Currency Cost\n_________________________________________________________\nADB 25.8 42.5 68.3 69.2\nUNICEF 0.5 0.5 1.0 1.0\nUNFPA 0.2 0.3 0.5 0.5\nWHO 0.2 0.1 0.3 0.3\nGovernment 0.0 28.6 28.6 29.0\n   Total 26.7 72.0 98.7 100.0\n_________________________________________________________\nADB = Asian Development Bank, UNFPA = United Nations Population Fund, UNICEF =\nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund, WHO = World Health Organization.\nLoan Amount The  equivalent  in  various  currencies  of  Special  Drawing  Rights\nand Terms 52,354,000  ($68.3  million  equivalent)  from  the  Asian  Development\nBank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Special Funds resources, with a term of 32 years,\nincluding a grace period of 8 years and an interest charge of 1 percent\nper  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  per  annum\nthereafter, and equal amortization.\nPeriod of Utilization Until 31 December 2006\nExecuting Agency Ministry of Health (MOH)\nImplementation The Project will be implemented by a central project management unit\nArrangements established within MOH and by provincial project management units", "iv\nestablished within the provincial departments of health in the 13 project\nprovinces.

Civil works under the Project are scattered\nthroughout  the  country  and  are  not  likely  to  attract  the  interest  of\ninternational contractors. Thus, it is proposed that civil work contracts\nbe awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures\nacceptable to ADB. Contracts for the supply of materials, equipment,\nand medical supplies in packages valued at $500,000 or more will be\nprocured through international bidding; contracts valued at less than\n$500,000  will  be  procured  through  international  shopping.  Some\nmedical equipment (e.g., hospital beds, delivery beds, and tables) that\nis locally produced and is unlikely to attract foreign suppliers will be\nprocured through LCB.

The Project will\nalso build capacity for preventive health and BCC at the provincial\nand district levels.", "I. THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Rural Health Project.\nII. INTRODUCTION\n2. As requested by the Government, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project\npreparatory technical assistance1 in 1999 to help prepare the Rural Health Project to improve\nthe health status of the rural population, especially the poor and disadvantaged, in 13 provinces\nof Viet Nam. The proposal was developed with the close participation of a wide range of\nstakeholders  including  representatives  from  the  related  government  ministries,  provincial\ngovernments, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), potential beneficiaries, service providers,\nand international development agencies. The Project will be cofinanced by the United Nations\nChildren\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF),  United  Nations  Population  Fund  (UNFPA),  and  World  Health\nOrganization (WHO) on a parallel basis. Fact-finding was carried out from 14 January to 2\nFebruary 2000. An Appraisal Mission2 was fielded 5-24 April 2000. The project framework is in\nAppendix 1.\nIII. BACKGROUND\nA.  The Health Sector\n3. Viet Nam has achieved a health status level beyond what is expected for a country at its\nstage of economic development. Life expectancy, for example, is 11 years longer than that of\nother countries at a similar stage of economic development. Infant mortality in the past 20 years\nhas been significantly reduced, from 90 per 1,000 live births in 1980 to 38 per 1,000 now.\nImmunization is almost universal and fertility rates have fallen by about 25 percent in the last\nfive years to 2.4 children per women. Compared with other economic development measures,\nmalnutrition is one of the few indicators in which Viet Nam may be lagging\u201339 percent of\nchildren are malnourished.\n1. General Health Patterns\n4. Viet  Nam  is  currently  facing  epidemiological  polarization  whereby  communicable\ndiseases coexist with noncommunicable diseases. While infectious, vector-borne and other\ncommunicable  diseases  still  account  for  a  large  percentage  of  mortality  and  morbidity,\nespecially in rural areas, the incidence of noncommunicable diseases is also rising rapidly. The\nrural population has three times as large a burden of disease per unit population as the urban\npopulation.  At  the  same  time,  the  rural  populations  have  a  substantial  burden  of\nnoncommunicable  diseases,  some  of  which  can  be  traced  to  injuries  and  chemical\ncontamination during the Indochina war of the 1960s and later.\n                                                \n1 TA 3077-VIE: Rural Health Project, for $600,000, approved on 25 September 1998.\n2 The Mission comprised I. Bhushan, Senior Project Economist/Mission Leader; T. Konishi, Young Professional;\nD.C. Jayasuriya, Consultant; and E. Whitney, Consultant.", "2\n5. The aging population, increasing trend towards urbanization, and unhealthy lifestyles are\nexpected to further increase the incidence of noncommunicable diseases and thereby add to\nthe disease burden. For example, mortality from coronary disease in Viet Nam is projected to\nincrease by 60 percent from 1995 to 2010. The rate could increase by even more if smoking\nbecomes more widespread. Similarly, increased hypertension and deaths from apoplexy will\nresult. Deaths caused by chronic pulmonary obstructive disease could increase due to aging,\npollution, and smoking. Cancers are expected to increase at similarly rapid rates. Diabetes\nmellitus and endocrinologic diseases have not been widely studied, but it is estimated that\ndiabetes afflicts 1-2 percent of the population.\n6. Since about 1990, accidents have become a leading cause of mortality and morbidity,\nparticularly for men aged 15-49. In 1990-1997, mortality caused by traffic accidents increased\nthree times. The prevalence of tuberculosis has been falling due to overall development, but\nmay have slightly increased in recent years, in part due to the growing HIV/AIDS3 problem. The\ndisease burden of malaria has been significantly reduced for the vast majority of the population.\nIn 1998, the Ministry of Health reported 383,000 cases with 183 deaths.\na. Health and Poverty\n7. Health status is closely associated with poverty in Viet Nam. Sickness and ill-health lead\nto poverty, and the health status of the poor tends to be worse than that of the nonpoor. The\noccurrence of illness\u2014leading to loss of labor resources and significant costs for curative health\ncare and associated expenditure\u2014is reportedly one of the prominent causes of poverty. Studies\nshow that once a household loses an adult member to sickness or disability, income levels\nsuddenly drop and the household slides into poverty. The burden of disease\u2014as measured by\nthe disability adjusted life years (DALYs)4 lost per thousand people\u2014among the poorest rural\nyoung children is more than 27 times the rate among those in urban areas. For the entire\npopulation, the poor rural population has a four fold greater disease burden than urban dwellers.\n8. Malnutrition among children less than 4 years is nearly three times greater for the rural\npoor than for urban dwellers. The average duration of illness restricting normal activity is greater\namong the poor than the well-off\u201417.5 percent greater in rural areas and 33 percent in urban\nareas. The infant mortality rate in 1998 in the rural poor areas of the country was nearly 50\npercent greater than that in all rural areas and fourfold greater than that in urban areas. This\ndifference partly reflects the relatively poor availability of maternal and child health services in\nrural areas. Similarly, in the mid-1990s, life expectancy was over 10 years greater in the more\nurban and relatively affluent Red River delta (70.8 years) than in the poorer and mountainous\ncentral highlands (60.5 years).\nb. Children and Women\n9. Infant mortality in rural areas is typically 50 percent higher than that in urban areas. In\naddition, there are pockets of poor and disadvantaged groups, such as ethnic minorities, where\nthe rate is 50 percent higher than that in the average rural area. The leading causes of infant\nmortality  in  areas  of  high  mortality  are  acute  respiratory  infection,  diarrhea,  malaria,  and\ndiseases preventable by immunization. Respiratory infections and diarrhea account for nearly\n60 percent of infant mortality. Neonatal mortality is mostly due to umbilical tetanus (about 40\n                                                \n3 Human immunodeficiency virus/Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\n4 Disability adjusted life year (DALY) is defined as the present value of the future years of disability-free life that are\nlost as the result of premature death or cases of disability occurring in a particular year.", "3\npercent), trauma at birth (about 30 percent), and pneumonia (about 15 percent). Malnutrition is\na major contributing factor in most infant deaths occurring in poor areas.\n10. Women of reproductive age bear more than 80 percent of the burden of communicable\ndiseases,  nutritional  deficiency,  and  perinatal  and  maternal  conditions  in  the  rural  areas.\nMaternal mortality in Viet Nam is estimated to be 110 for every 100,000 live births\u2014160 in rural\nareas and 200 among the poor. In the remote mountainous areas, maternal mortality is probably\nfour times that in the average rural area. This is because services to address sudden acute\nconditions that may occur during delivery are simply not available. The leading causes of\nmaternal  mortality  are  hemorrhaging,  postpartum  infection,  eclampsia,  tetanus,  and  uterus\nrupture. Thirty percent of women of reproductive age suffer from malnutrition, which is closely\nlinked with women's social status and stunting from chronic protein-energy malnutrition.  This\nimpacts on women's quality of life, productivity, stamina, and capacity for postnatal recovery.\nMost of these conditions can be prevented through regular prenatal examinations and medical\nsupervision during risky pregnancies.\n11. While the total fertility rate has fallen to 1.8 children per woman in urban areas, the rate\nis high in rural areas (2.9 children per woman), especially among ethnic minority groups (3.4\nchildren per woman). The contraceptive prevalence rate is 79.3 percent at the national level; the\nfigure is lower in rural areas (74.4 percent) and much lower in ethnic minority areas (66.4\npercent). Although no reliable figures are available, it is widely believed that the prevalence of\nreproductive tract infections is very high among women of reproductive age and contributes to\nsexually transmitted diseases. HIV/AIDS is a growing concern in the country, especially in areas\nbordering the People\u2019s Republic of China and Cambodia. A recent World Bank study indicates\nthat domestic violence, which affects women's mental and physical health status, is widely\nprevalent.\n2. Health System\n12. The public sector health system in Viet Nam is organized in four tiers. At the central\nlevel, the Ministry of Health (MOH) is responsible for formulating health policies and establishing\ntechnical  standards  for  the  health  system.  MOH  has  15  departments  divided  into  general\ndepartments (planning, personnel, finance, legislation, international cooperation and inspection\nboard) and specialty departments (therapy, preventive medicine, mother and child care and\nfamily planning, traditional medicine, medical equipment and construction, drug administration\nand food safety and hygiene). MOH also has a Health Strategy and Policy Center and a Health\nEducation Center. In addition, the central offices of MOH operate 10 specialty hospitals, 19\ninstitutes (typically involved in the vertical programs), 11 medical and pharmacy schools and\nstate-owned enterprises such as the health insurance company, a publishing corporation, and\nan equipment corporation. The organization of MOH is shown in Appendix 2.\n13. The country has a well-developed infrastructure of health services with a wide network of\nprovincial, district, intercommune, and commune health centers. On average, families are 4.4\nkilometers (km) from a commune health center and 10 km from a district health center.\n14. At the provincial level, the provincial People\u2019s Committee supervises the health service\nand is responsible for managing and directing health care. It is also responsible for preventive\nmedicine centers, provincial-level medical training schools, local production of medical supplies,\nand  operating  the  provincial  hospital.  The  provincial  health  service,  while  under  the\nadministrative control of the People\u2019s Committee, receives technical guidance and monitoring\nfrom MOH.", "4\n15. The district health center (DHC) is a unit of the provincial health service under the direct\ntechnical management of the director of Provincial Health Services, with guidance and policy\nprovided by the district People\u2019s Committee. The DHC manages the first-level referral curative\nservices and is responsible for formulating and implementing a district health plan; providing\ncurative, preventive, and family planning services in the district; and giving technical support to\nintercommune polyclinics (ICPs) and commune health centers (CHCs).\n16. The CHC is the first level of health care in the public health system. It is responsible for\nprimary-level curative care as well as preventive care, normal delivery, provision of essential\ndrugs, family planning, and overall health improvement in the community. It functions under the\nguidance of the DHC for technical matters and under the chairman of the commune People\u2019s\nCommittee for planning and supporting health development activities in the commune.\n17. The village health worker (VHW) is an integral part of the health system network. About\n40 percent of the 80,000 villages have a VHW. VHWs play a particularly significant role in\nextending health care services in poor and remote areas, in ethnic minority communities, and in\nthe highly populated communes. MOH policy is to increase the coverage of these workers.\n18. Private sector services have grown rapidly in recent years. The number of private health\nproviders has almost doubled since 1996. However, this growth is less visible in terms of health\nclinics than in the number of private pharmacies, which grew from an estimated 2,000 in 1990 to\naround 7,500 by end-1996.\n3. Health Care Utilization\n19. Coverage and utilization of maternal and child health services are adequate, except\namong ethnic minorities and poor people. About 89 percent of deliveries are supervised by a\ntrained service provider: 99 percent in urban areas and 87 percent in rural areas. However, the\nquality of service providers varies significantly. While 75 percent of deliveries are supervised by\na doctor in urban areas, only 19 percent of rural deliveries are so supervised.\n20. The  rural  poor  use  public  health  services  only  about  half  as  much  as  the  urban\npopulation do. The pattern of utilization is the most strikingly different for hospital outpatient\nservices, where the rural poor use only 25 percent of that by the urban population. Surveys\nshow that, once sick, the poor are less likely to use health facilities and more likely to self-\nmedicate.  Even  when  they  use  health  services,  they  are  more  likely  to  go  to  unqualified\nproviders and low-quality health facilities. This is a manifestation of both more limited physical\naccess to quality health services in rural areas and lower affordability of health services.\n21. Studies on the quality of health services point to the need for modernizing equipment,\nupgrading dilapidated facilities, improving staff skills and motivation, and increasing supervision\nand support. Ninety percent of the surveyed DHCs have difficulties in providing quality care due\nto limited equipment. District laboratory capability is extremely limited, and in most facilities, the\nX-ray equipment is very old. Referral services for emergencies, surgery, and obstetric and\ngynecological  services  can  also  be  significantly  improved  by  the  provision  of  the  basic\nequipment prescribed for these services by MOH standards. Staff are available at most districts,\nbut as services have not been available for some time, their skills have become outdated. Very\nfew ICPs have any diagnostic equipment.", "5\n4. Human Resources\n22. MOH, with a staff of approximately 213,000 employees, is the largest employer of health\npersonnel in Viet Nam. There are over 10,000 health workers in other ministries. The armed\nforces operate a medical service independently of the health sector.\n23. There  are  substantial  differences  in  access  to  qualified  health  personnel  between\nprovinces and even within provinces. Ho Chi Minh City, Hai Phong, and Quang Ninh, for\nexample, have at least 5 doctors per 10,000 population, while in provinces of the northern\nhighlands  and  Mekong  River  delta,  this  ratio  is  significantly  lower\u20142  doctors  per  10,000\npopulation. Within a province, health resources tend to be concentrated in the provincial capitals\nand, to a lesser extent in the districts.\n24. The Government has consistently placed high priority on the development of human\nresources  for  health.  In  the  early  part  of  the  transition  after doi moi,  as  the  number  of\ncommunity-supported  commune  health  workers  rapidly  declined,  the  Government  quickly\nadopted a policy of providing financial support for these workers directly from the Central\nGovernment budget. This reversed the decline in utilization of services at the CHC. The current\npolicy is to provide 40 percent of CHCs with a physician by the year 2000, the current coverage\nbeing 22.5 percent.\n25. Many health workers have not had sufficient opportunity to upgrade their skills and\ntechnical knowledge. Consequently, there is a need for retraining in the districts and communes\nto upgrade workers\u2019 skills and inform them of advances in medical science and new technology.\nIt is difficult to precisely assess the quality of health staff in the project provinces. However, the\nlow utilization of health services and high morbidity rates for some common diseases reflect the\npossibility that quality of care is an issue. In remote areas, the quality of the typical health staff\ncan be improved.\n26. The  formal  training  system  of  MOH  includes  a  network  of  university  and  technical\ntraining  schools  some  80  in  all  nationwide.  The  Department  of  Science  and  Training  is\nresponsible for the technical aspects of the training. Each province has a secondary medical\nschool (SMS), which trains mainly secondary-level personnel and, occasionally, elementary-\nlevel health workers. There are approximately 50 SMSs, 10 training centers, and 7 national\nschools  of  nursing,  pharmacy,  traditional  medicine,  and  medical  technicians  that  train\nsecondary-level workers. Provincial SMSs and training centers are under the control of the\nprovincial health service.\n5. Health Financing\n27. The health sector has grown rapidly in recent years. Per capita spending for health\nincreased from about $12 in 1993 to more than $19 in 1998. About one half of total health\nexpenditure was spent on publicly operated health facilities and related preventive programs.\nPrivately  provided  diagnostic  services  comprised  about  one  sixth  of  the  total,  with\npharmaceutical services making up about one third. Households remain the dominant source of\nfinancing health care services, accounting for about 80 percent of all health expenditures. The\nshare of health expenditures financed by health insurance is 2-2.6 percent. International aid\nagencies  finance  a  similarly  small  share.  User  charges  constitute  an  important  source  of\nrevenue  for  hospitals,  and  contribute  about  7  percent  of  total  health  expenditure.  The\nGovernment at all levels finances the remaining 11-15 percent from its general revenues. While\nprivate sector spending for health care services clearly dominates the sector, public sector", "6\nspending for health has increased significantly since 1986. Per capita government expenditure\non health increased 4.1 times between 1986 and 1998. However, it still represents only over 1.0\npercent of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and at less than $4 per capita remains\nmuch lower than the World Bank-recommended level of $12 to provide basic primary health\ncare (PHC) services.\n28. Health insurance, introduced in 1992, covers 9.8 million people\u2014about 15 percent of the\npopulation. There are two insurance programs operated by the same agency. A compulsory\nprogram  of  health  insurance  includes  all  government  employees,  workers  of  state-owned\nenterprises, foreign-owned firms, and international organizations and any private firm with more\nthan 10 employees. The voluntary health insurance scheme is intended to primarily cover family\nmembers of those insured under the compulsory scheme, farmers, other rural populations, school\nstudents, and informal sector workers. While the compulsory program has enrolled more than 75\npercent of its target population, the voluntary program has barely made a dent into its intended\ntarget group. This implies that the growth of health insurance in the future must focus on the\npopulation intended to be served by the voluntary program.\n6. Major Issues in the Sector\na. Equity and Quality of Care\n29. One of the biggest challenges facing policy makers in the health sector is the large\ninequities in health outcomes and utilization of health services. People in rural areas and the\npoor are at greater disadvantage than their urban and better-off counterparts. Analysis shows\nthat while the health care needs of women, children, and the poor are much greater than those\nof others, these groups do not adequately use health services. The major reason for low\nutilization of health services by the poor is the high cost. Other contributing factors are the poor\nquality of services in rural areas and the indifference of service providers. For ethnic minority\ncommunities, difficult geography and barriers of language and culture also play an important\nrole. These factors have contributed to increased use of self-treatment among disadvantaged\ngroups.\n30. Another priority issue for health services is the need for improved quality of care. The\neconomic transition, with general fiscal constraints and the disappearance of the agriculture\ncooperative system that supported CHCs, has resulted in marked deterioration of PHC services\nat all levels. This is manifested in dilapidated buildings, acute shortage of equipment and\nsupplies, inadequate retraining, and low productivity of service providers due to difficult working\nconditions and poor salaries. The experience of the Population and Family Health Project5\nshows that improvements in quality of care can be achieved by supporting services that are\nrequired to meet the most serious health needs at commune and district levels. These needs\ninclude complications from delivery, access to referral facilities for high-risk pregnancies, and\nimmediate referral services for childhood diseases and accidents. These services must be\nreadily available at district centers.\nb. Changing Disease Patterns and Emerging Challenges\n31. Viet  Nam  is  undergoing  an  epidemiological  transition:  the  pattern  of  diseases  is\nchanging  from  a  predominance  of  communicable  diseases  to  a  predominance  of  largely\nnoncommunicable  diseases.  A  significant  emerging  issue  for  the  health  system  is  how  to\n                                                \n5 Loan 1460-VIE: Population and Family Health, for $43 million, approved on 19 September 1996.", "7\nappropriately address the changing burden of disease. Evidence shows that this changing\npattern of disease is already affecting the health system in some rural areas. The challenges for\nthe health system are to provide the most appropriate cost-effective care, and to diagnose the\nearly signs of lifestyle diseases including cancer and cardiovascular conditions before they\nevolve into life-threatening conditions entailing costly treatments for the individuals and the\nhealth system. This will also require greater emphasis on health education and behavior change\ncommunication (BCC).\n32. The rapid increase of HIV/AIDS infection, growing illicit drug use, declining but still high\nlevels of tobacco use, a large increase in accident-related deaths, and persistently high levels of\nchild malnutrition require priority attention. In addition, the area of food hygiene and safety is\nemerging  as  a  major  public  health  challenge.  The  number  and  types  of  food  processing\nbusinesses and facilities are expanding at a phenomenal rate in response to increasing demand\nfor ready-to-eat food and the withdrawal of the government from such services. Many of these\nnew enterprises are using ingredients and chemicals that, if not efficiently monitored, can create\nmajor health hazards for the public. Chemical contamination caused during the Indo-China war\nis also believed to have affected the food chain and poses a threat to health of the population.\nThe  food  safety  inspection  program,  particularly  at  the  province  level,  needs  substantial\nstrengthening.\nc. Health Sector Financing\n33. The overall public financing of the health sector in Viet Nam is low by international\nstandards. Moreover, public financing remains concentrated on subsidizing curative services.\nOne unfortunate consequence of the low levels of public financing is that the poor have to bear\nthe burden of high user charges at public health facilities. These fees have discouraged use. In\naddition, there are large disparities in government health expenditure across provinces since\nricher provinces are able to spend more than poorer provinces. The situation also exacerbates\ninequities in provision of health services across the country. Pharmacies take a large share of\nspending  on  health.  Current  spending  patterns  show  inefficiency  due  to  poor  prescribing\npractices and overuse of antibiotics.\n34. User fee collection has increased dramatically in recent years\u2014increasing more than\nfour times from 1991 to 1998. In theory, the poor and disadvantaged should not be subject to\nuser charges. In practice, however, these guidelines rarely work, especially in the communes.\nStudies  have  found  a  weak  correlation  between  fee  exemptions  and  household  income.\nIdentification of the poor at public facilities is based on the subjective judgment of the health\nproviders.\n35. Health insurance primarily covers people working in the formal sector, thereby almost\ncompletely leaving out the poor. Comprehensive coverage through voluntary health insurance\ncan potentially make a significant contribution to health financing requirements and effectively\npool the health risks of the population. Appropriately designed health insurance programs can\nyield both efficiency and equity gains. Insurance policies can influence where people seek care\nand discourage inefficient use. The health care provider can be influenced by the design of the\npayment mechanism so that the most appropriate care is provided. The poor can also be\ntargeted by directly subsidizing their premiums.", "8\nd. Health Management\n36. The health system works under conditions dominated by the past culture of central\nplanning. This is manifested in two ways: first, significant amounts of funds and resources are\nallocated through the rigid structure of top-down vertical programs, which are not adequately\nresponsive to local needs. Second, previous processes have never offered opportunities for the\ndevelopment of capacity and initiative for program planning and implementation at the provincial\nand  district  levels.  There  is  a  strong  need  to  integrate  various  vertical  programs  and\ndecentralize the planning functions of MOH, while developing capacities at provincial and district\nlevels so that they can provide effective leadership in addressing local problems. Another\nmanagement  concern  relates  to  service  delivery.  Improvements  in  the  referral  system,\nsupportive supervision of health facilities in districts and communes, improved management\ninformation system (MIS) and more intensive community participation can significantly improve\nthe efficiency of services.\ne. Regulation of the Private Sector\n37. The national health policy encourages the development of the private sector. However,\nthe role of the private sector in the health system needs to be clarified and supervision and\nmonitoring of the quality of care provided by private practitioners strengthened, especially since\nmany providers operating in the private sector are also employed in the public sector. Also,\nrapid expansion of retail pharmaceutical outlets in recent years has encouraged self-treatment\nand overuse of drugs. This unsupervised and often irrational use of drugs has resulted in high\nlevels of antibiotic resistance, which poses a serious threat to the country\u2019s ability to control and\nprevent the spread of infectious diseases. Stronger efforts are required for controlling both\ndemand for and supply of pharmaceuticals.\n38. Another private sector issue that has direct impact on health is the safety and hygiene of\nfood items available in the market. The trend toward consumption of ready-to-eat food is rising\nand the number of private sector suppliers of processed food items shows a manifold increase.\nTherefore a major challenge for the public health system is to ensure a safe and hygienic food\nsupply. Current regulations on food adulteration remain ineffective and there are concerns about\nthe ability of provincial health services to enforce them.\nB. Government Policies and Plans\n39. Government policies in the health sector support the provision of health for all, with\nspecial emphasis on the health needs of the poor and disadvantaged. The Government policy,\nas articulated in the Law on Protection of People\u2019s Health 1989, recognizes the major role of the\ngovernment in managing, improving, and developing systems for preventing and controlling\nepidemics, medical examination and treatment, production and distribution of equipment and\ndrugs,  and  monitoring  the  implementation  of  all  regulations  on  professional  medicine  and\npharmaceutical practices. Specific programs and guidelines have been developed for specific\nhealth needs, including tuberculosis, malaria, immunization, malnutrition, diarrheal disease, and\nacute respiratory diseases.\n40. The MOH\u2019s 1996 policy statement\u2014The Strategy Orientation for People\u2019s Health Care\nand Protection from Now to the Year 2000 and 2020\u2014provides a medium-term vision for the\nhealth sector. The document lays down specific goals in terms of health status, organizational\nstructure, training, research, promotion of management, socialization strategies, and promotion\nof priority health programs, placing rural health at its center. The objectives of the strategy are to", "9\nexpand the health network, improve the quality and efficiency of health care provision, and\nimplement a policy to achieve social equity in health care. The key feature of the policy is\nstreamlining the organizational structure and developing a decentralized health care network.\n41. In addition to the basic law guiding health institutions and structures, other laws that\nhave been enacted add specificity to the strategy for achieving the basic goals. For example, for\nthe first time, the Ordinance on Private Medical and Pharmaceutical Practice6 provides the legal\nbasis for private medical practice both modern and traditional. The law outlines the types of\nprivate practice allowed and the criteria for licensing of practitioners.\n42. In  1989,  the  Government  established  well-defined  policies  and  procedures  for  cost\nrecovery for health services. The Government defined the types of services that could be\ncharged to the patient, patients that were provided exemptions, and the system for distribution\nand use of the collected fee. This decision was replaced in 1994 by a Decree7 providing more\nclarification on collection and use of fees by hospitals, including their relationship to health\ninsurance cardholders.\n43. Government policies that have evolved over the last decade pay more attention to the\nneeds of the poor and disadvantaged. The cost recovery policy promulgated in 1994 specifically\nprovides exemptions for the poor and disadvantaged groups. A particularly significant measure\nwas a decision8 on setting priorities for poor and remote communities. This decision identified\n1,715 communes that will have special priority for investment in all sectors. Particular attention\nis placed on 1,000 of these communes where poverty reduction and other social and economic\ngoals are specifically targeted. In addition, the Government has specific policies and guidelines\nfor addressing priority target groups such as children and women, in response to various United\nNations conventions. For example, the National Plan of Action for Child Survival is based on the\n1991 law on the Protection and Care of Children. This Law entitles all Vietnamese children\nunder six years of age to receive free medical examinations and immunizations. Recently, the\nGovernment also announced a new initiative of providing free health insurance coverage to 4\nmillion poor people in the country.\n44. The Government recognizes that, with the growing demand for processed foods and the\nexpansion of food service establishments, there is an urgent need to ensure a hygienic and safe\nfood supply for the population. Two recent regulations provide the policy direction and technical\nrequirement for MOH and other agencies to establish programs that will guarantee a safe food\nsupply.9 These regulations assign MOH as the main agency responsible for ensuring food\nsafety.  The  specific  responsibilities  include  dissemination  of  information  and  education,\ninspection and monitoring analysis, and reporting on food safety activities. The regulations\nfurther define inspection and control activities that will be carried out by the provincial food\nsafety units, including the specific tests to be performed.\n                                                \n6 Ordinance No. 26 L/CTN of October 13, 1993 on Private Medical and Pharmaceutical Practices.\n7 Decree No. 95/CP of August 27, 1994, of the Government on Collection of Hospital Fees.\n8  Decision  No.135/1998/QD-TTg,  July  31,  1998;  Socioeconomic  Development  in  Mountainous  and  Remote\nCommunes with Special Difficulties.\n9  Directive No. 08/1999 CT-TTg, dated 15 April 1999, of the Prime Minister outlines goals and the organization of the\nnational food safety program; Directive No. 14/1999 QD-TTg of the Prime Minster outlines the specific duties of the\nMinister of Health and provincial level in ensuring a safe food supply for the country.", "10\nC. External Assistance to the Sector\n45. Many external agencies have been involved in financing the health sector in Viet Nam.\nAbout 179 projects have been financed by international development agencies and NGOs since\n1991. However, most of the projects are small in size and scope. The details of total official\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) for the sector are in Appendix 3. The seven largest contributors\naccount for nearly 90 percent of total official ODA resources to the health sector. These are\nADB,  Australia,  Japan,  Sweden,  UNICEF,  European  Union,  and  World  Bank.  In  addition,\nUNFPA, WHO, and the Netherlands have played an important role in strengthening the health\nsector in Viet Nam.\n46. The annual financial flows into the health sector have almost doubled between 1991 and\n1998, with $75 million of external assistance disbursed in 1998. However, external assistance in\nthe last five years has remained almost constant in real terms. In fact, the share of ODA\nfinancing for the health sector has declined over time\u2013from 14 percent of total health sector\nspending in 1991 to 7 percent in 1996 and 9 percent in 1997. Grant assistance also shows a\ndeclining trend in absolute terms and is being gradually replaced with loan funds.\n47. The pattern of external assistance for health in Viet Nam has been lopsided, leaving\nseveral  geographic  areas  and  critical  sectors  underfunded.  Assistance  has  been  highly\nconcentrated among a few provinces. For example, a large proportion of total disbursements of\nODA over the period 1991-1998 has gone to Ho Chi Minh City, Da Nang, and Hanoi. Studies\nshow that more than 80 percent of ODA in this period went to provinces accounting for only\nabout 30 percent of the population. Targeting of external assistance to a few provinces may\nhave been justified if the selected provinces were the poorest in the country. However, analysis\nshows no systematic relationship between external assistance and the per capita GDP of the\nprovince, with the result that some of the neediest provinces have not benefited much from\nexternal assistance.\n48. The  focus  of  external  assistance  has  been  on  providing  support  to  vertical  health\nprograms of MOH. More than 60 percent of the committed funds between 1990 and 1998 were\nfor  nine  vertical  programs.  This  focus  is  probably  based  on  ease  of  implementation  and\ndisbursement,  since  vertical  programs  are  clearly  defined  programs  with  well-developed\nimplementation  structures.  Human  resource  development  (excluding  that  conducted  in  the\nvertical programs) has accounted for only about 4 percent of committed external support.\n49. Only recently has significant support gone into upgrading health facilities, mainly from\nthe recent projects supported by the World Bank and ADB. The Population and Family Health\nProject  supported  by  ADB  and  the  World  Bank,  and  the  National  Health  Support  Project\nsupported by the World Bank cover 36 of the 61 provinces of Viet Nam. In addition, the Health\nProject  financed  by  the  European  Union  will  upgrade  PHC  facilities  in  three  provinces.\nTherefore, not counting the three relatively well-off provinces of Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and Da\nNang, the remaining 19 provinces do not have any major support for upgrading the PHC\ninfrastructure.\n50. The presence of a large number of international agencies in the sector is a challenge for\nMOH. In last few years, MOH has gained valuable experience in coordinating the activities of\ndifferent  agencies.  Recently,  it  demonstrated  its  capacity  to  effectively  coordinate  external\nassistance  by  leading  a  health  sector  review  supported  by  all  the  major  international\ndevelopment agencies and NGOs in the sector. Different international agencies have made", "11\nincreasing efforts to coordinate their activities and leverage their interventions and projects\naround a common set of objectives and priorities.\nD. Lessons Learned\n51. MOH has implemented several externally funded health projects in the last decade.\nSome  lessons  learned  from  implementing  these  projects  and  from  ADB\u2019s  experience  in\nimplementing health projects in other countries are as follows:\n(i)  Aid  agency  coordination.  Lack  of  aid  agency  coordination  in  designing  and\nimplementing  projects  has  led  to  inefficient  and  wasteful  use  of  resources;\nconflicting philosophies about health system processes including training, MIS,\nand  information,  education  and  communication  (IEC);  and  delays  in  project\nimplementation. Smooth flow of information among the involved international\nagencies is essential for optimal outcomes from project investments, during both\nproject design and implementation.\n(ii)  Preproject  implementation  activities.  Early  establishment  of  the  project\nmanagement unit (PMU) and provincial PMUs and their close involvement in\nproject preparation are important for the success of a project. It is beneficial to\ntrain senior staff in competitive bidding and project implementation procedures,\nbefore commencing project implementation.\n(iii)  PMU staffing. It is important to have a critical pool of full-time staff for the PMU to\nensure continuity and adequate planning, support, and supervision. In general,\nprojects largely staffed by contracted personnel and headed by junior officials\nhave not performed well.\n(iv)  Involvement of community leaders. The quality of interventions and beneficiary\nownership of the project investments are better when community leaders are\ninvolved and consulted during planning and implementation.\n(v)  Decentralization.  Decentralization  of  appropriate  management  control  and\ndecision making by the PMU to the provinces increases operational efficiencies,\nboosts the morale of the provincial project teams, and reduces the management\nburdens of the central PMU.\n(vi)  Flexibility in project design. Assessment of the ongoing ADB-funded Population\nand Family Health Project highlights the need for keeping project design flexible.\nIn several communes with large populations, slightly different CHC designs were\nconsidered more appropriate. Similarly, centrally procured drugs, from a common\nlist of essential drugs were not found useful in many communes.\nE. ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n52. ADB\u2019s strategic objective for Viet Nam is poverty reduction through equitable growth,\nwith  special  emphasis  on  rural  development.  ADB\u2019s  operational  strategy  emphasizes  that\nsupport for human development activities should focus on improving the quality of the labor\nforce, including the health of disadvantaged groups. This approach recognizes that investments\nand creation of an appropriate enabling environment in Viet Nam\u2019s health sector are vital for\nreducing  the  vulnerability  of  the  poor  and  disadvantaged  to  ill  health,  increasing  their", "12\nproductivity, and expanding their choices. The operational strategy also meshes well with ADB\u2019s\nrecently adopted poverty reduction strategy based on the three pillars of (i) pro-poor growth,\n(ii) social development including development of human capital through investments in health\nand education, and (iii) good governance. The guiding principles for ADB activities in the health\nsector are elaborated in ADB\u2019s health sector policy10 and include (i) focus on improving the\nhealth of the poor, women, children, and indigenous peoples; (ii) encouraging governments of\ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) to take an appropriate and activist role in the health\nsector including increasing public investment in PHC health care, facilitating private sector\ninvolvement  in  health,  and  increasing  the  focus  on  public  goods;  and  (iii)  assisting  DMC\ngovernments in strengthening their managerial capacity and strengthening linkages with other\nsectors.\n53. These  strategic  considerations  are  generally  relevant  for  Viet  Nam.  Specifically,  a\nnumber of areas of concern have been instrumental in shaping ADB\u2019s health sector activities in\nViet  Nam,  including  (i)  deterioration  in  the  quality  of  publicly  provided  health  services;\n(ii) declining utilization of such services, particularly by disadvantaged groups including women\nand ethnic minorities; (iii) need for greater clarity on the government\u2019s role in the health sector;\n(iv) limited capacity for policy development and planning at the central level and need for skills\ndevelopment at the provincial, district, and commune levels; and (v) inadequate integration of\nthe implementation of health sector policies with policies in related sectors.\n54. Given these needs and areas of concern, ADB\u2019s main objectives in the health sector in\nViet Nam are to (i) help revitalize the quality of commune-level health services; (ii) help improve\nutilization  rates,  especially  in  rural  areas,  with  better  targeting  of  women,  children,  and\ndisadvantaged groups; (iii) encourage shift in emphasis of public spending toward preventive\nand primary health care; (iv) assist in repositioning the role of the government in the sector and\nstrengthen public-private partnership in health while ensuring equitable access to health care;\n(v) provide support for health policy development, strategic planning, and investment planning;\nand (vi) improve human resources in the health sector. In the family planning subsector, the\nobjectives are to (i) increase coverage of family planning services with an expanded supply of\ncontraceptive devices and methods; (ii) promote an integrated approach linking family planning\nwith  public  health  programs;  (iii)  improve  and  expand  Viet  Nam\u2019s  IEC  capability;  and\n(iv) increase the involvement of the private sector.\nF. Policy Dialogue\n55. A health sector review,11 supported by all major international development agencies,\nwas recently completed. The draft report shows that investments to upgrade and improve the\nquality  of  health  facilities  at  district  and  commune  levels  will  benefit  the  poor.  Moreover,\nincreasing the utilization of DHCs by improving the quality and coverage of their services and\npromoting community participation is a cost-effective approach. The findings from the draft\nreview formed the basis for policy dialogue with MOH. During project preparation, discussions\nwere held with senior officials from MOH and related ministries. In addition, a workshop of key\npolicy makers was organized to discuss the issues and options for financing health sector\nprograms in Viet Nam. The following issues were discussed and actions agreed upon.\n                                                \n10 Asian Development Bank. 1999. Policy for the Health Sector.\n11Ministry of Health. 1999. Viet Nam Health Sector Review.", "13\n1. Health Care for the Poor\n56. The Government is committed to improving the health status of the poor and increasing\ntheir access to quality health services. The recently introduced policy to provide free health\ncards to 4 million poor people demonstrates this commitment. However, the following related\nissues need further urgent consideration:\na. Coverage for All Poor People\n57. The free health card scheme covers 4 million people, whereas the total number of poor\nin the country is estimated to be 28 million (37 percent of population), with the extreme poor\nnumbering an estimated 11 million (15 percent).12 The Government does not have the financial\ncapacity to cover all poor people through the health card scheme at present, however, it\nrecognizes the need to develop and test various modalities for subsidizing health care for the\npoor. Piloting a compulsory health insurance system is one option. The Government has agreed\nto review the health card scheme within two years of loan effectiveness and will introduce\nappropriate revisions. Using the review as basis, the Government will develop options for\nexpanding the free health card scheme to cover a wider segment of the poor population.\nb. Sustainable Level of Premiums\n58. Under the free health card scheme, the Government will pay a premium of D30,000 per\ncapita for providing health insurance to the poor. There are concerns that this premium may not\nbe sufficient to cover the costs of health care, especially after the scheme matures. The level of\npremium will need to be constantly reviewed considering costs and trends in health service\nutilization by the cardholders. In conjunction with the review of the health card scheme, the\nGovernment  will  review  the  adequacy  of  the  premium  after  gaining  experience  from\nimplementation of the scheme.\nc. Information Dissemination\n59. Currently,  the  poor  lack  information  about  the  health  card  scheme.  Even  service\nproviders are not fully aware of the details of the scheme. For successful implementation, the\nGovernment has agreed to organize communication campaigns to disseminate information\nabout the scheme to potential beneficiaries, community leaders, and service providers.\nd. Reimbursement to CHCs\n60. More than 90 percent of the poor live in rural communes, where they are most likely to\nuse commune-level health services. However, the health insurance structure currently does not\nreimburse health care services at the commune level. The health insurance system deals with\nhigher level health institutions, since it does not have sufficient administrative capacity to deal\nwith the large number of CHCs. Since the inability of health cardholders to obtain free services\nfrom CHCs will defeat the basic objective of the scheme, a more effective system needs to be\ndeveloped whereby CHCs are reimbursed for health care provided to the poor either on a fee-\nfor-service basis or capitation basis. Since reimbursing CHCs on a fee-for-service basis may not\nbe administratively feasible, the Government will consider channeling part of the premium to\nCHCs on a capitation basis to cover all the PHC costs. The Government has agreed to develop,\n                                                \n12World Bank. 1999. Viet Nam Development Report 2000-Attacking Poverty. Washington, DC.", "14\nwithin  two  years  of  loan  effectiveness,  policy  guidelines  for  reimbursing  at  least  all  inter-\ncommune polyclinics for services provided to health cardholders.\n2. Essential Drugs\n61. An adequate supply of drugs and medicines is key to improving the quality of services\nand  raising  utilization  rates.  Within  three  years  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will\nestablish revolving funds for essential drugs in all CHCs in the project area, where there is no\nlicensed drug store. This will ensure an adequate supply of good-quality drugs at the commune\nlevel. To regulate the irrational use of drugs, especially antibiotics, the Government will aim to\ndevelop, implement, and enforce a new drug law within the next two years, which will include\ndetailed  regulations  on  prescriptions,  over-the-counter  sales,  and  division  of  medical  and\npharmaceutical practices.\n3. Project Sustainability\n62. The proposed additional investments at the province level have implications for the\noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  budget  for  health  facilities.  In  the  absence  of  a\ncorresponding increase in the budget, the project investment will not be effective in improving\nquality, and service delivery and project results will not be sustained. The Government has\nagreed to increase its health sector budget for the project provinces by 3 percent per annum in\nreal terms and the provincial governments have agreed to allocate sufficient budgets for O&M of\nhealth facilities.\n4. Food Safety\n63. Chemical  contamination  and  food  adulteration  are  emerging  as  major  public  health\nproblems in Viet Nam. Among the communicable diseases, diarrheal diseases contribute to the\nsecond highest burden of disease, next to influenza. The Government fully realizes the need to\nstrengthen the policy framework for food safety and is committed to carry out policy reforms in\nthis area. The Government will promulgate an ordinance laying down the standards for food\nsafety  and  establishing  procedures  and  role  and  responsibilities  at  different  levels  of\nadministration for ensuring the hygiene and safety of food for human consumption. ADB is\nproviding technical assistance13 to the Government to build the capacity for implementing the\nprovisions of the ordinance.\nIV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n64. Despite impressive achievements in the health sector, health status and the use of\nhealth services in Viet Nam remain much poorer in rural areas than in urban areas. These\ninequities are even more stark for poor and remote rural areas and those inhabited by ethnic\nminorities. Women suffer the most from such inequities. Evidence shows that the economic\ntransition has adversely affected the ability of the poor to seek access to quality health care.\nMalnutrition, especially among the poor, remains a challenge. In addition, there are emerging\nhealth problems related to smoking, injuries through automobile accidents, and HIV/AIDS.\n                                                \n13TA 3483-VIE: Capacity Building for Prevention of Food-borne Diseases, for $500,000, approved on 29 August\n2000.", "15\n65. Poor health is both a cause and effect of poverty. Improving the health status of people,\nespecially women and children, in rural areas will contribute substantially to poverty reduction.\nHowever, the situation will require interventions that address both demand- and supply-side\nconstraints. More appropriate and better quality health services need to be provided in the rural\nareas, and management and supervision need to be improved. Financial barriers to access\nmust also be addressed by supporting innovative health financing mechanisms. At the same\ntime, there is an urgent need to pay greater attention to prevention activities, generate demand\nfor services, and ensure greater community participation in the provision of services.\n66. Although many international agencies have contributed significantly to the health sector\nto date, there is still a substantial financing gap in the coverage of the PHC sector in the\ncountry. Several provinces require large investments for improving health infrastructure. ADB,\nwith the support of UNICEF, UNFPA, and WHO, is well-placed to supply and mobilize both\nfinancial and technical resources to fill this gap. The Project will support the Government\u2019s\npolicy to improve the health status of the poor, and is in line with ADB\u2019s overarching strategic\nobjective of poverty reduction. The Project is also in line with ADB\u2019s operational strategy for Viet\nNam, which emphasizes efficient economic growth with equity and poverty reduction.\n67. The Project will be implemented in 13 provinces over a five-year period. The project\nprovinces have a population of 15 million, comprising about 20 percent of the country\u2019s total.\nThe project provinces were selected on the basis of (i) financing needs and absence of any\nlarge externally funded project, (ii) poverty incidence, and (iii) health care needs. All have\nsubstantial financing needs for rehabilitating the PHC infrastructure. The project provinces have\na much larger proportion of the country\u2019s rural and poor population than the country as a whole.\nIn general, the health status of their people is among the poorest in the respective regions. The\ntotal proportion of the poor in the project area is 49 percent compared to a proportion of 37\npercent in the country as a whole. The Project will cover 1.4 million of the ethnic minority\npopulation.  Basic  information  about  the  project  provinces  and  the  selection  criteria  are  in\nAppendix 4.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n68. The Project\u2019s goal is to improve the health status of the rural population, especially the\npoor and disadvantaged in 13 provinces. The specific objectives are to\n(i)  promote access to quality PHC services\u2014with special emphasis on improving\nthe quality of health services for women and children, ethnic minority groups, and\nthe  poor\u2014by  upgrading  preventive  and  curative  health  structures,  basic\nequipment, and staff skills;\n(ii)  strengthen overall financial management by facilitating a government policy to\nprovide health care to the poor and developing a pilot model for voluntary rural\nhealth insurance;\n(iii)  improve  management  capacity  to  implement  PHC  programs  and  strengthen\nprevention programs at the provincial and district levels; and\n(iv)  strengthen community participation and support behavior change communication\n(BCC),  especially  focused  around  safe  motherhood,  child  survival,  nutrition,\nHIV/AIDS, injury prevention and smoking.", "16\n69. The  Project  has  three  components.  The  components  and  subcomponents  were\ndesigned in a participatory manner with the involvement of a wide range of stakeholders,\nincluding  potential  beneficiaries,  service  providers,  program  managers,  NGOs,  related\nministries, and international agencies. Several meetings and workshops were organized to\nobtain feedback on the Project design. An ethnic minority plan was developed under ADB-\nfinanced technical assistance14 with the participation of representatives from ethnic minorities.\nThe project components are described below.\n1. Improving Access and Quality of Care (Component A)\n70. This component will focus on improving access to and quality of health care by\n(i)  developing  and  mainstreaming  national  guidelines  for  integrated  and  quality\nhealth services,\n(ii)  upgrading health care facilities and equipment, and\n(iii)  training service providers.\na. Guidelines for Integrated and Quality Services (A.1)\n71. The  Project  will  develop  integrated  care  guidelines  that  provide  a  comprehensive\nframework for improving the health of the rural population, especially that of children and\nwomen, through prevention, cure, and care. The integrated approach requires health service\nproviders to have a broader understanding of care and not simply of treating the specific present\ncondition. The purpose of the integrated care guidelines is to (a) give health workers technical\nguidance on how to provide comprehensive care to women and children; and (b) provide a\nframework for design of services, and facilities and equipment needs.\n72. The guidelines will be based on in-country experience gained from implementing the\nMother-Baby  Package,  Integrated  Management  of  Childhood  Illness  strategies,  and  some\nadditional elements of reproductive health. A number of linkages with other parts of the health\nsystem are required to make the integrated care concept work. The linkages will be explicitly\ndefined for such activities as referral services, training, supervision, planning and organizing,\ninformation, support and general management. The Project will also assist in developing quality\nstandards for each service element based on the integrated care guidelines. Quality standards\nwill be classified in relation to input (human and material resources and organization), process\n(the actual practice of delivering care or prevention strategies), and output (the direct end result\nof input and process). Key indicators for each quality standard will be finalized and monitored.\nThe ongoing TA Capacity Building for Rural Health15 will also support the activities in this\nsubcomponent.\nb. Upgrading Health Facilities and Equipment (A.2)\n73. The  Project  will  strengthen  CHCs,  ICPs,  DHCs  and  regional  hospitals16  in  the  13\nprovinces to increase access and improve the quality of services. The Project will finance (i) civil\nworks; and (ii) medical equipment, furniture and essential drugs and supplies to enable the\n                                                \n14TA 5794-REG: Study of the Health and Education Needs of Ethnic Minorities, for $800,000 approved on 30 June\n1998.\n15TA 3337-VIE: Capacity Building for Rural Health, for $600,000 approved on 14 December 1999.\n16 Regional hospitals are upgraded DHCs in remote areas. They provide services similar to those of the DHCs, but\nhave larger capacity for both inpatient and outpatient services.", "17\ncenters to deliver the basic package of PHC. The Project will provide the inputs required to bring\neach facility up to the specified standard.\n74. Civil Works. The Project will upgrade or build approximately 99 ICPs, 74 DHCs, and 13\nregional hospitals. The requirements have been estimated on the basis of detailed surveys\nduring project preparation. However, the Project will update the requirements at inception to\naccount for potential changes due to conditions including the creation of new districts and\ncommunes, unforeseen contingencies such as floods, and construction of some buildings from\nother sources. All civil works will be completed within the first two years of the Project, so that\nsubsequent quality improvement measures may be institutionalized within the project period.\nThe  criteria  for  upgrading  health  facilities  are  given  in  Appendix  5.  The  Government  has\nprovided  assurances  that  these  criteria  will  be  strictly  followed.  Also,  all  health  facilities\nupgraded under the Project will be adequately maintained during and after the life of the Project,\naccording to the agreed upon guidelines (Appendix 5).\n75. For upgrading, the Project has carefully selected health facilities with good potential for\nbeing utilized. The Project may upgrade a small number of commune level health facilities in the\nproject area, primarily located in remote and poor areas, although its main focus will be on\nupgrading DHCs, which function as the first level of referral and are more likely to be used by\nthe poor. At the district level, the Project will strengthen surgery, emergency, obstetrical and\ngynecological services, and diagnostic activities. The Project will support the establishment of\nregional  hospitals  in  each  province.  These  centers,  located  in  remote  areas,  will  provide\nadditional and specialized services for more than one district and will serve the poor and ethnic\nminorities.\n76. The  designs  of  health  facilities  under  the  Project  will  conform  to  the  guidelines\ndeveloped by MOH and will be similar to those in similar externally aided projects. The designs\nwill provide adequate visual and auditory privacy to the patients. They will be simple and use\nindigenous materials for ease in local maintenance. All facilities will have adequate medical\nwaste disposal units. The Project will not cover communes under the Primary Health Care\nProject  funded  by  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID)  in  three\nprovinces.\n77. Equipment and Supplies. The Project will finance medical equipment, furniture, and\nsupplies at regional, district, commune and intercommune polyclinic levels. A standard package\nof inputs has been developed for all levels (Appendix 6). In addition, equipment will be supplied\nto village midwives and commune nurses. Procurement and supply of equipment will be closely\ncoordinated with civil works. The Project will ensure that health personnel are properly trained to\nuse the equipment and operational manuals are in Vietnamese. The Government has provided\nassurances  that  equipment  will  be  maintained  during  and  beyond  the  project  period  by\nadequate increases in O&M budgets.\n78. The Government will finance the essential drugs and supplies through its own budget or\nthrough  grant  financing  from  UNICEF  or  other  international  agencies.  Revolving  funds  for\nessential drugs will be established in all communes of the 13 provinces where there are no\nlicensed drug stores. The poor and disadvantaged will be exempted from user charges. These\nexemptions will be carefully monitored for proper targeting. The Government will appropriately\nreplenish revolving funds that get depleted, especially in communes of the poor and ethnic\nminorities.", "18\nc. Training of Health Service Providers (A.3)\n79. The Project will support two types of training activities. The first will strengthen the\ncommune health staff by training more than 5,500 workers in the delivery of integrated care.\nThe second will upgrade the technical skills of district staff by training about 500 doctors and\n1,400 other health care providers working at DHCs. Training activities will focus on improving\ntechnical skills competency in medicine, public health, and service quality improvement for\ncommune and district staff. Priority emphasis at the commune level is on learning to work with\nthe community. District and commune staff will be involved as partners in the process of\nlearning  to  work  more  effectively  with  the  community,  thereby  strengthening  an  important\nmanagement linkage between the two levels. WHO, UNICEF, and UNFPA will support the\ndevelopment of training modules and materials. Special training modules will be developed for\nservice providers working in ethnic minority areas. NGOs will be involved in training commune-\nlevel health workers. The Project will collaborate with the AusAID-funded Primary Health Care\nProject in three provinces.\n80. Training  activities  cut  across  all  Project  components.  Sixteen  types  of  training  are\nenvisaged (details are in Appendix 7). Recognizing the need for greater coordination between\ntraining activities within and outside the Project, each province will prepare an annual training\nplan. The annual plans will take into account the training needs of health providers in the\nprovince and available training resources in terms of trainers, facilities, and funds. Special\nattention will be paid to ensuring proper linkages between the different training programs,\nfacilitating  appropriate  scheduling,  and  avoiding  overlaps.  The  plans  will  also  provide  for\nmonitoring and evaluation of the training programs.\n2. Improving Health System (Component B)\n81. This component will increase the efficiency, equity, and sustainability of health services\nby  focusing  on  both  the  financing  and  management  aspects.  The  component  has  three\nsubcomponents:\na. Health Financing (B.1)\n82. The  financing  intervention  will  support  two  initiatives,  namely,  (i)  facilitating  the\nimplementation of the health cards for the poor, and (ii) piloting the development of a more\nsustainable rural health insurance.\n83. The Government has decided to make access to health services more equitable by\nproviding free health cards to the poor. The Project will assist the Government in implementing\nthe scheme by strengthening the capacity of the Viet Nam Health Insurance Authority (VHIA)\nand developing systems for effectively monitoring costs and use of services under the scheme.\nThe Government will provide free health cards to about 800,000 poor people17 in the project\narea. The free health card scheme will increase the workload of VHIA by 30 percent. The health\ninsurance management information system (HIMIS) will be improved to ensure close monitoring\nof membership, costs, and reimbursements. The Project will also support studies to establish a\nsustainable  level  of  premiums  for  health  cards,  benefit  package,  appropriate  targeting\n                                                \n17The poor people will be selected by the Ministry of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs based on criteria in\nNotification No. 1751/LDTBXH dated 20 May 1997. The guidelines are based on household income. The poor\nhouseholds will be further ranked according to the household and other assets. The approximately bottom 30\npercent of poor people will be eligible for free health cards.", "19\nmechanisms,  and  cost-effective  provider  payment  options.  This  subcomponent  will  be\nimplemented in collaboration with WHO, which will provide international consulting services and\nsupport capacity building for VHIA.\n84. The Project will pilot voluntary rural health insurance initiatives in two communes each in\nNinh Binh, Quang Binh, Khanh Hoa, and Long An provinces. The objective is to develop\neffective and sustainable models for community health insurance in rural areas. The Project will\nsubsidize health insurance premiums on a declining level during the project period. It will also\nsupport marketing of the scheme to people in the communes during the first two years of pilot\nimplementation.  The  pilots  will  be  carefully  documented  and  monitored  to  facilitate  future\nreplication. The Project will support the timely analysis of information related to enrollments,\npremiums paid, services used, and expenditure.\nb. Management (B.2)\n85. This  subcomponent  will  strengthen  management  and  planning  capabilities  at  the\nprovincial, district, and commune levels. A series of training workshops will be organized to\nupgrade planning and management skills at provincial and district levels with main emphasis on\nusing financial resources efficiently and directing services to priority target groups. Provincial-\nlevel management training will focus on overall planning of services including allocation and\nefficient use of resources and providing technical support to the districts. District-level training\nwill focus on supervision and monitoring.\n86. Recognizing the need for information for planning and management, the Project will\ninvest in improving the MIS. MOH is in the process of finalizing the software and detailed plans\nfor improved MIS in the country. A similar MIS will be implemented in the project area. It will be\nfully computerized at national, provincial, and district levels and linked through the Internet. The\nProject will support the costs of computers, associated software, other MIS office equipment,\nplanning and training workshops, and development of a homepage for each province. The\nProject will focus on improving the use of existing information. An attempt will be made to\nensure that information is not only routinely collected but adequately analyzed and that the\nresults of the analyses are shared at other levels within the organization.\n87. The Project will support the MOH initiative in community-based monitoring (CBM) as a\ntool to involve the community in planning and improving commune-level services. Pilot CBM\nmodels have been implemented in the last few years with the support of UNICEF. MOH has\ndeveloped guidelines to structure the involvement of communities in the activities of CHCs. The\nProject will replicate these models in collaboration with UNICEF, which will support development\nof prototype materials, training of key trainers, and monitoring and evaluation.\n88. The Project will support policy studies to fill existing information gaps. Some areas that\nrequire more research include province-level information about burden of disease, malnutrition,\nabortion, HIV/AIDS, and health status of ethnic minorities. Areas for policy research will be\nprioritized by provinces, and studies undertaken with the concurrence of ADB.\nc. Project Management (B.3)\n89. The Project will finance necessary equipment, furniture, and consulting services for\neffective  implementation,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  project  activities.  A  domestic\nconsultant will be engaged to supervise surveys and studies for the midterm review and prepare", "20\na background report. A household health survey will be undertaken in the last year of the project\nperiod to assess the impact of the Project.\n3. Strengthening Prevention and Community Participation (Component C)\n90. This component will strengthen the public health infrastructure\u2014especially that related to\nfood hygiene and BCC\u2014and community participation in the project area.\na. Preventive Care (C.1)\n91. The Project will strengthen the capacity of the provincial preventive centers to ensure the\nsafety of food for public consumption. The Project will finance laboratories for preventive health\ncare including food testing, training for epidemiologists working in provincial preventive centers,\nand development of policies and guidelines for routine testing of food items. This component\ndirectly responds to the urgent need for strict regulations for food safety.\nb. Behavior Change Communication (C.2)\n92. This subcomponent will (i) strengthen BCC planning and management capacity at the\nprovincial and district levels, and (ii) support and expand BCC programs and activities. The\nobjective is to achieve improved health knowledge among the rural population and to facilitate\ncommunity participation in improving their own health status. BCC can improve access to and\nquality of care. It can enhance access by providing families with knowledge about the availability\nof services, and improve the quality of care by improving knowledge about when care may be\nrequired and emphasizing the importance of continuing care.\n93. The Project will build the planning and management capacity of the newly established\nprovincial health education centers. The Project will finance communication equipment and\ntraining at provincial and district levels to build the capacity to plan, implement, and monitor\nBCC activities and campaigns. Counseling and interpersonal communication skills of health\ncare  providers  in  districts  and  communes  will  also  be  improved  by  training  and  providing\ndiscussion aids, such as flip charts. The design of communication material will pay special\nattention to the language and cultural needs of ethnic minorities. Training for health providers\nwill be part of the integrated care package and will be undertaken in collaboration with UNICEF\nand UNFPA. Health providers working in ethnic minority areas will be given specialized training,\nkeeping in view the special health conditions and cultural perceptions of modern medicine.\n94. Each province will make an annual BCC plan based on the priority health problems in\nthe province. The Project will focus on these areas: (i) malnutrition, (ii) reproductive health,\n(iii) HIV/AIDS, (iv) prevention of accidents/injuries, and (v) awareness about the adverse effects\nof smoking. The Project will finance special BCC campaigns focusing on the priority health\nissues. The campaigns will be organized in partnership with the Viet Nam Youth Union, Viet\nNam  Women\u2019s  Union,  and  NGOs.  The  BCC  plans  will  take  into  account  the  special\ncommunication needs and low reach and acceptability of media in the poor and ethnic minority\nareas, and will use local and culturally acceptable media channels and methods.\nc. Village Health Workers (C.3)\n95. The Project will support the Government\u2019s policy of expanding the VHW network in\nremote and disadvantaged areas. VHWs play a key role in facilitating community involvement in\nthese areas since they live in the same village and share the same culture and language. VHWs", "21\nact as an effective link between the health system and the community. The Project aims to have\none trained VHW in each remote and ethnic minority village by the end of the project period.\nThe Project will train or retrain (if already identified) VHWs in communication skills, effective use\nof IEC material, and basic PHC messages. Selected subcontractors will conduct the courses for\nVHWs.  The  VHW  training  program  will  be  the  same  as  that  currently  used  by  provinces\nincorporating the new activities of integrated care packages. VHWs will play a key role in\nimplementing the BCC strategy.\nC. Technical Justification\n96. The Project takes an integrated approach focusing on both supply- and demand-side\ninterventions. This approach ensures that improvements in the quality of services will proceed\nsimultaneously with improvements in supervision and management of services, generation of\ndemand for services, and improvements in affordability of services. Experience has shown that\nattention to only supply-side interventions does not lead to increased utilization of services or\nhealth improvements, especially by the poor who cannot afford services to begin with and do\nnot often have sufficient knowledge about the availability of and need for using the services. The\nProject will focus on improving the quality of services by improving facilities and the skills of\nhealth care providers. At the same time, the Project will improve the affordability of services\nthrough free health cards for the poor and generate demand for services through BCC activities.\n97. For both efficiency and equity reasons, the Project supports the strengthening of PHC\ninfrastructure and public health services as opposed to secondary and tertiary levels of health\ncare. PHC interventions have been found to be one of the most cost-effective strategies for\nimproving health. Public subsidies for PHC facilities are much more equitably captured than are\nthose  for  provincial  and  central-level  hospitals.  Hence,  increasing  the  resources  for  PHC\nfacilities will also have more than a proportionate positive effect on the poor.\n98. Within PHC, the Project will focus on district hospitals with special emphasis on maternal\nand child health services, diagnostics, surgery, and emergency services. The health sector\nreview has shown that increased use of district hospital services is highly cost-effective since\nthe marginal returns outweigh the marginal costs. Moreover, district hospitals are a first level of\nreferral system in rural areas largely inhabited by the poor. Therefore, increased use of district\nhospitals will lead to both increased efficiency and better health care for the poor.\n99. The emphasis on maternal and child health, and diagnostic, surgical, and emergency\nservices is justified on the ground that these services (i) cover most diseases, (ii) benefit the\nvulnerable population including women and children, (iii) help in reorienting the system for\nongoing epidemiological transition, and (iv) have positive externalities or are public goods. The\nBCC component will revolve around malnutrition, reproductive health, HIV/AIDS, prevention of\naccidents/injuries, and awareness of the adverse effects of smoking, which represent the major\nexisting and emerging challenges in the health sector in Viet Nam.\nD. Cost Estimates\n100. The total cost of the Project including physical and price contingencies, and taxes and\nduties is estimated at $98.7 million equivalent. Of this amount, $26.7 million equivalent, or\n27 percent of total cost, is the foreign exchange cost, and $72.0 million equivalent, or 73 percent\nof total cost, is the local currency cost. A summary of the cost estimates is given in Table 1 and\ndetailed estimates are in Appendix 8.", "22\nTable 1: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nComponent Foreign Local Total\nExchange Currency Cost\nA.

It is also assumed that the exchange rate will change to reflect purchasing power\nparity.\nc\nSome numbers do not exactly add up due to rounding.\nSource:  Staff estimates.\nE. Financing Plan\n101. The Project will be cofinanced with WHO, UNFPA, and UNICEF on a parallel basis. It is\nproposed that ADB provide a loan of $68.3 million equivalent from its Special Funds resources\nto finance 69.2 percent of the total project cost (Table 2). This covers $25.8 million of the foreign\nexchange cost (including interest on loan) and $42.5 million equivalent in the local currency\ncost, or 59 percent of the total local currency cost. ADB financing will be used to finance a\nportion  of  the  costs  relating  to  civil  works,  procurement  of  vehicles,  medical  and  office\nequipment, consulting services, training, research, and benefit monitoring and evaluation, but\nexcludes costs of land, salaries of regular project staff, rental of office space, and taxes and\nduties. The term of the proposed loan will be 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with\nan interest charge of 1.0 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum\nthereafter.", "23\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nSource Foreign Local Total Percent\nExchange Currency Cost\nADB 25.8 42.5 68.3 69.2\nUNICEF 0.5 0.5 1.0 1.0\nUNFPA 0.2 0.3 0.5 0.5\nWHO 0.2 0.1 0.3 0.3\nGovernment 0.0 28.6 28.6 29.0\nTotal 26.7 72.0 98.7 100.0\nADB = Asian Development Bank, UNFPA = United Nations Population Fund, UNICEF= United Nations\nChildren\u2019s Fund, WHO = World Health Organization.\nSource: Staff estimates.\n102. WHO  will  support  implementation  of  the  health  insurance  component  by  providing\ninternational consulting services and capacity building for VHIA. UNFPA will support training\nand BCC activities in three project provinces. UNICEF will support the implementation of CBM\nactivities and BCC activities. Support from UNFPA, UNICEF, and WHO will be on a grant basis.\n103. Financing for the local currency cost is considered justified under ADB\u2019s local currency\nfinancing policy.18 Viet Nam needs a large investment program to rehabilitate and upgrade\ndilapidated physical and social infrastructure. The need to generate domestic resources to\nfinance investments for sustaining economic growth is well recognized. However, it will take\nsome time before the country can develop the necessary resource base to adequately finance\nthe required level of investment without external finance. Under current circumstances, a large\ninvestment-savings gap will continue, hindering in particular programs that are aimed poverty\nreduction and human development with a large local currency content. Consistent with ADB\npolicy, a higher percentage of local cost financing for this poverty reduction project is justified.\nF. Implementation Arrangements\n1.  Project Management Structure\n104. A central project management unit (CPMU) with the assistance of provincial project\nmanagement units (PPMUs) in the 13 project provinces will be responsible for day-to-day\nimplementation of the Project. The organizational structure of project management is shown in\nAppendix 9. The province will be the principal unit in project implementation, while the CPMU\nwill provide technical, coordination, and logistics support. The CPMU will work under the overall\nguidance of a Project Steering Committee headed by the minister of health, or the vice-minister\nauthorized by the minister. The CPMU will be headed by a project director. It will have at least\nfour other full-time staff seconded from MOH and other contractual staff as needed to provide\nparticular technical expertise. Four technical groups dealing with (i) quality of services, (ii) health\ninsurance, (iii) health management and preventive health services, and (iv) BCC and community\nparticipation will support the CPMU and prepare annual action plans for submission to the\nproject director.\n105. The PPMU will work under the overall guidance of the vice-chairperson of the provincial\nPeople\u2019s Committee and will be headed by the director of provincial health services. The PPMU\n                                                \n18R1-95: A Review of Lending Foreign Exchange for Local Currency Expenditure on Projects, 3 January.", "24\nwill have at least two full-time staff seconded from the provincial health services and other\ncontractual staff as needed.\n2. Implementation Schedule\n106. The Project will be implemented over five years beginning in 2001 and ending in 2006.\nThe implementation schedule is in Appendix 10.\n3. Procurement of Goods and Services\n107. All  ADB-financed  procurement  under  the  Project  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement.  The  CPMU  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  carrying  out\nprocurement. In cases where procurement is done by PPMUs, the CPMU will ensure that the\nprocedure follows the ADB guidelines.\na.  Civil Works\n108. Under the Project, most civil works will consist of the construction of structures for\nDHCs, ICPs, regional hospitals, preventive health centers, and health education units. None of\nthe civil works will exceed $500,000. To allow for adequate supervision of construction, and due\nto the geographically dispersed locations of these structures, packages for all health units will\nneed to be limited to less than 20 each. Due to the small and scattered nature of the facilities to\nbe constructed, it is unlikely that the civil works will attract foreign bidders. Hence, it is proposed\nthat local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB be employed for these structures.\nTo rationalize design and construction specifications, detailed survey and design activities will\nbe required prior to tendering to assure that the facilities are appropriate for the population being\nserved and the level of service to be provided.\nb.  Equipment and Materials\n109. Medical equipment and supply packages for DHCs, ICPs, regional hospitals, CHCs,\npreventive  health  centers,  and  health  education  units  will  be  procured  under  international\ncompetitive bidding if the package exceeds $500,000. Packages for equipment costing less\nthan  $500,000  will  be  procured  using  international  shopping,  and  those  costing  less  than\n$100,000, through direct purchase. The CPMU and PPMUs will procure office equipment and\nvehicles under international shopping or direct purchase. Office furniture, motorcycles, and\nbicycles will be purchased using local competitive bidding procedures or direct purchase. To\nachieve economy and efficiency, goods of similar nature will be grouped into packages under\none or more tenders. Contracts may be awarded on a package basis, or on a least-cost\ncombination of packages basis.\nc. Consulting Services\n110. One international (8 person-months) and 98 domestic consultants (522 person-months)\nwill be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other\narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The consultants\nwill  (i)  prepare  and  adapt  integrated  care  guidelines  and  quality  of  care  guidelines\n(1 international and 2 domestic); (ii) prepare training modules for district and commune service\nproviders (12 domestic, including 3 for ethnic minority areas); (iii) undertake feasibility studies\nfor the rural health insurance pilots, design health insurance cards, develop the health insurance\nmanagement information system, and develop training programs for health insurance officials", "25\n(10  domestic);  (iv)  develop  training  modules  and  materials  for  management  training  for\nprovincial and district officials (10 domestic); (v) prepare and adapt guidelines for BCC planning\nand implementation and develop training modules and materials for training BCC officials (3\ndomestic);  and  (vi)  support  VHWs  (5  domestic).  In  addition,  domestic  consultants  will  be\nrecruited for (i) survey and design of health facilities (31 domestic); (ii) training health staff in\nusing MIS (4 domestic); (iii) undertaking the household survey and analyzing data to evaluate\nthe  impact  of  the  Project  (15  domestic);  and  (iv)  preparing  guidelines  for  bidding  and\nprocurement  of  equipment  (6 domestic).  This  level  of  consulting  services  is  the  minimum\nrequired to effectively carry out the Project. Consulting services requirements and brief terms of\nreference are outlined in Appendix 11.\n4. Advance Action\n111. MOH will take advance action to expedite project implementation. In particular, MOH will\n(i) issue a ministerial decree establishing the CPMU and PPMUs; (ii) shortlist firms to carry out\nengineering design and construction supervision; (iii) shortlist individual consultants for technical\nassignments in the project; and (iv) develop the roles, structure, and functions of CPMU and\nPPMUs.\n5. Disbursement Procedures\n112. Expenditures  for  procurement  contracts  and  other  payments  larger  than  $50,000\nequivalent will utilize direct payment and commitment procedures for withdrawing loan funds.\nExpenditures  valued  at  $50,000  or  less  will  utilize  statement-of-expenditure  procedures.\nDisbursement will follow the detailed guidelines established in interministerial circular number\n81. An imprest account will be established within three months of loan effectiveness. It will be\nliquidated and replenished according to the procedures in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.\nADB will reimburse the imprest account following the procedure in the Loan Disbursement\nHandbook. Second-generation imprest accounts will be opened in all provinces. They will be\nreimbursed  by  the  central  account  on  submission  of  full  supporting  documents  for  the\nexpenditure.\n6. Accounts and Auditing\n113. The Government, acting through MOH, will maintain records and accounts adequate to\nidentify goods and services financed from the loan proceeds. The CPMU will (i) maintain\nseparate accounts for the Project; (ii) ensure accounts and financial statements are audited\nannually, in accordance with sound accounting principles, by auditors acceptable to ADB; and\n(iii) submit to ADB, not later than 12 months after the close of each fiscal year, certified copies\nof audited accounts and financial statements, and the auditor\u2019s report on them.\n7. Reporting\n114. The CPMU will prepare project progress reports every six months and submit them to\nADB within six weeks after the end of the semi-annual period. The reports will be in a format\nacceptable to ADB, and will include (i) progress made against established targets, including\naspects of quality; (ii) delays and problems encountered, and actions taken to resolve issues;\n(iii) compliance with loan covenants; (iv) proposed program of activities to be undertaken during\nthe next six months; (v) expected progress during the succeeding period; and (vi) maintenance\nand  repair  activities  undertaken  on  the  health  facilities.  Within  three  months  of  physical", "26\ncompletion of the Project, the Government will prepare and submit to ADB a project completion\nreport on the execution of the Project, including costs and compliance with the loan covenants.\n8. Midterm Review of the Project\n115. While the Project will be continuously reviewed, the Government and ADB will also\njointly undertake a midterm review during the third year of implementation. The midterm review\nwill (i) review the scope, design, implementation arrangements, and other relevant issues in light\nof the Government\u2019s development strategies and the policy framework and strategic social\nconcerns of ADB; (ii) examine progress toward achieving the measurable objectives of the\nProject; (iii) identify changes since the time of appraisal relating to sector issues, resource\nmanagement  and  allocation,  etc.,  and  reassess  their  impact  with  regard  to  future  project\nimplementation and sustainability; (iv) assess implementation performance against appropriate\nprojections;  (v)  review  and  establish  compliance  with  various  loan  covenants;  (vi)  identify\nproblems  and  constraints;  and  (vii)  formulate  appropriate  recommendations  for  corrective\naction.\n9. Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation System\n116. In accordance with ADB\u2019s Handbook on Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation, the Project\nhas selected a short list of verifiable indicators for monitoring and evaluation (Appendix 12).\nBaseline values for these indicators will be estimated using data from the national health survey\nbeing undertaken in 2000. The final values of the indicators will be estimated from data from a\nhousehold survey planned under the Project in 2005.\n117. Analysis of the verifiable indicators will be disaggregated by income, sex, and ethnicity.\nThe analysis will include non-Project areas to allow comparison. The Project will monitor the\nenvironmental impact of the interventions by monitoring waste disposal and by checking the\nwater quality of randomly selected wells near the regional hospitals constructed under the\nProject. An independent firm under the supervision of MOH will carry out the final evaluation of\nthe Project. The Executing Agency will collect data but analysis and reporting will be the\nresponsibility of the independent firm. The evaluation will be financed with proceeds from the\nloan.  For  benefit  monitoring,  the  CPMU  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  data  collection,\nanalysis, and reporting to all interested parties, including ADB. Delivery of services to recipients,\nuse of services by recipients, and effects of services will be monitored through regular reports\nand routine data collected through the health MIS. Focus group discussion with beneficiaries will\nbe carried out at midterm and at the end of the Project.\nG. The Executing Agency\n118. The MOH will be the Executing Agency. MOH has gained useful experience in project\nimplementation from the existing National Health Support Project supported by the World Bank.\nNevertheless, MOH\u2019s implementation capacity needs to be strengthened, especially at the\nprovincial level. ADB is separately providing capacity building TA to improve the management\nand  financing  of  health  services.  The  Project  also  includes  interventions  to  strengthen\nmanagement capacity at central and provincial levels.", "27\nH. Environmental and Social Measures\n1. Environment\n119. The Project will have no significant adverse environmental effect. Most civil works entail\nrehabilitation  of  existing  structures.  The  location  of  all  new  facilities  and  the  design  and\nconstruction of all project facilities will cause minimal disturbance to the environment and natural\nresources.  Optimal  use  of  local  materials,  natural  light,  and  natural  ventilation  will  be\nconsidered. Handling of refuse and measures for disposing of hazardous medical waste, e.g.,\nsyringes and needles, will be specifically addressed in the design and operation of the health\ncenters.\n2. Social Analysis\n120. Forty nine percent of the population in the project area is poor and 10 percent belong to\nethnic minorities. The health status of these groups is significantly poorer than that of the better-\noff, urban, and ethnic majority (Kinh) communities, and is heavily influenced by communicable\nand infectious diseases, and morbidity and mortality associated with childbearing. During the\nproject preparation phase, communities were consulted to identify their health priorities and the\nbarriers that they face in seeking access to health services. Feedback from them was factored\ninto the project design to ensure that the poor and disadvantaged will adequately benefit from\nthe Project and actively participate in its implementation. The Project expects no negative social\nimpact such as that caused by land acquisition and resettlement. New structures will be built on\ngovernment land with existing health facilities.\na. Poverty\n121. Poverty incidence19 within the project area is 49 percent compared with 37 percent in the\ncountry.  Poverty  and  health  status  are  closely  associated  (Appendix  13  gives  a  detailed\ndiscussion). The occurrence of illness\u2014leading to loss of labor resources and significant costs\nfor curative health care and associated expenditure\u2014is reportedly one of the prominent causes\nof poverty. While the poor suffer from the heaviest disease burden, they are also less likely to\nseek health care. They also use poorer quality service providers than the nonpoor. The main\nreasons for the poor\u2019s lower utilization of health care services are (i) poor access to quality\nservices, (ii) unaffordability of such services, (iii) lack of knowledge about the need for and\navailability  of  services,  (iv)  less  than  encouraging  attitude  of  service  providers,  and\n(v) inadequate insurance coverage.\n122. The project design specifically addresses the constraints often faced by the poor in\nseeking health care services. First, the Project will improve access to quality services in poor\nareas. Second, it will support free health card schemes for the poor, thereby improving the\naffordability of services. Third, under the BCC component, the Project will generate a demand\nfor health services, especially among the poor. Fourth, training of health care providers will\nfocus not only on technical areas but also on the interpersonal communication skills to reduce\nthe social distance between them and their clients. Fifth, the Project will assist the Government\nin developing models for comprehensive health insurance, which would be helpful in providing\ninsurance coverage to all including the poor. Finally, the Project encourages participation of the\npoor in management of health services through CBM and VHWs.\n                                                \n19The poverty line in Viet Nam is defined as the minimum per capita expenditure required in consuming 2,100\ncalories and corresponding nonfood items. The poverty line was estimated to be $128 per capita per year in 1998.", "28\nb. Gender\n123. In all subcomponents, the Project will target women and girls, who will comprise the\nmajority of the project beneficiaries. Rural women, especially those of ethnic minority groups,\nare most affected by poverty, as they bear a disproportionate burden of coping with daily\nhardships due to their multiple roles in both productive and reproductive areas. They engage in\nheavy daily tasks for long hours, often at the cost of their own health. As women perceive the\nopportunity cost of using health services to be high, it is essential to bring health services closer\nto them through improved service quality and, where possible, reduced costs, as well as to\nattract them closer to services by generating demand. The Project will address poor women\u2019s\nneeds through all subcomponents, especially:\n(i)  improved  maternal  and  child  care  services  based  on  the  integrated  care\napproach and extended by better trained health staff; and\n(ii)  special counseling services for women as part of the BCC subcomponent, which\nwill enable women to deal with sensitive health issues including reproductive\nhealth and domestic violence.\n124. Furthermore, the community participation efforts of the Project will emphasize the role of\nwomen in planning and using community health services, in collaboration with the Viet Nam\nWomen\u2019s Union. Children will also benefit through the improved health services and improved\nhealth status and knowledge of mothers. The Viet Nam Youth Union will be engaged to facilitate\ncommune activities to strengthen the preventive programs.\nc. Ethnic Minorities\n125. Some project provinces, especially those in the northern highlands and central region,\nhave  a  significant  number  of  ethnic  minorities  (e.g.,  69  percent  in  Hoa  Binh).  The  ethnic\nminorities are the most challenging of all target groups, due to their general poverty, difficulties\nin reaching them, lack of health awareness combined with high illiteracy rate, and, in many\ncases, health services that do not address their culturally sensitive needs. Therefore, the Ethnic\nMinorities Development Plan (EMDP) was prepared in accordance with ADB policy and will be\nimplemented as part of the Project (Appendix 14).\n126. Under  the  EMDP,  the  health  needs  and  concerns  of  the  ethnic  minorities  were\nmainstreamed through training for district and commune health staff and VHWs and CBM. In\naddition, special activities are planned for implementation: training traditional birth attendants,\npreparing of an ethnic minorities health handbook, establishing commune-level herbal gardens,\nand translating IEC materials into ethnic languages, where possible. Much of the ethnic minority\npopulation will also benefit from the health cards for the poor, given the high incidence of\npoverty  among  them.  To  monitor  the  project  implementation,  communities  will  be  heavily\ninvolved and external assistance will be sought through NGOs, where necessary.\nd. Community Participation\n127. Community participation is a key strategy of the Project, given that the effectiveness of\nhealth programs, especially maternal and child health, reproductive health, and preventive care,\ndepends on the capacity of communities to address their specific needs and absorb improved\nhealth services. Through the CBM scheme developed by UNICEF, communities will be involved", "29\nin  planning,  implementing,  and  monitoring  commune-level  health  services.  Under  CBM,\ncommunity  representatives  will  consolidate  community  perceptions  of  the  quality  of  health\nservices, monitor behavior changes among community members, and provide feedback to\ncommune health staff and VHWs. The expansion of the VHW network will also encourage\ncommunity participation through their monthly household visit. The CBM and VHW network are\nespecially important among ethnic minority communities, many of whom are difficult to reach.\nWherever  possible,  the  Project  will  work  closely  with  NGOs  and  mass  organizations  (i.e.,\nWomen\u2019s  Union  and  Youth  Union)  in  training  commune-level  health  workers  and  VHWs,\nmonitoring the implementation of the EMDP, and CBM.\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA. Project Benefits\n128. There is a strong justification for investments proposed under the Project, both on equity\nand efficiency grounds (Appendix 15). In particular, the Project is justified on the following basis:\n(i)  The Project supports the government in taking a proactive stance on issues that\nexhibit significant market failure or strongly positive externalities or both. There\nare compelling reasons for an active role for the Government on these issues,\nsince left to normal market forces, investment in these interventions will be less\nthan optimal. The project intervention related to food safety and prevention of\ncommunicable diseases will have strong positive externalities, because the social\nbenefits of the interventions far outweigh the private benefits. Therefore, the\nprivate sector does not have sufficient incentive to invest in these interventions.\nSimilarly, the Project focuses on issues known to have significant market failure,\nsuch  as  health  insurance,  catastrophic  illnesses  and  information  asymmetry\nbetween  the  health  care  providers  and  patients.  In  the  absence  of  active\ngovernment interventions, the market outcomes on these issues will be non-\noptimal.\n(ii)  The Project will improve access to quality health services for 12.7 million people,\nthereby improving their health status. Improving the health status will lead to\nsubstantial economic gains in terms of improved productivity, better returns on\ninvestment in children, and savings in the direct and opportunity cost of treating\nprevented illnesses. For example, in 1997/98 the economic cost of people\u2019s\nillness in terms of foregone earnings in Viet Nam was estimated to be about 8.7\npercent of GDP.20 In addition, the total expenditure on health care amounts to\nabout $400 million every year. Even a 10 percent reduction in sickness in the\nproject provinces will translate into an additional annual productivity gain of $50\nmillion. It will also mean a saving of $40 million in the direct cost of health care,\nand much more if the indirect costs are included.\n(iii)  The proposed interventions are among the most cost-effective ones available,\nsuch as health education, reproductive health care, and immunization. The Project\nwill  yield  improvement  in  health  status  at  a  relatively  low  cost,  estimated  at\nbetween $12 and $24 per DALY saved. Interventions costing below $100 per\nDALY saved are considered to have high cost-effectiveness.\n                                                \n20  Ministry of Health. 1999. Viet Nam Health Sector Review.", "30\n(iv)  The current health system is already in place in the form of buildings, staff, and\nland, but is seriously underutilized. A modest investment for improving quality and\ngenerating demand is expected to substantially increase utilization, and thereby\nimprove efficiency. Econometric analysis in the Health Sector Review shows that\ndistrict hospitals have short- and long-run economies of scale. The results imply\nthat there will be gains from expanding the output at district hospitals.\n(v)  Finally, the Project will provide long-term benefits by strengthening the health\nsystem in terms of (a) developing and mainstreaming integrated care guidelines,\n(b) improving management and supervision of health services, (c) more rational\nand  equitable  health  financing,  (d)  improving  policies  and  capacity  for  food\nsafety, and (e) better capacity for planning and organizing BCC activities.\nB. Poverty Reduction\n129. The Project was designed as a core poverty project and will meet the health needs of\nthe remote rural poor and ethnic minorities (detailed discussion in Appendix 13). While the\nProject aims to provide curative and preventive health services to all segments of the population\nin  the  project  provinces,  the  majority  of  the  beneficiaries  will  be  the  poor.  Interventions\nsupported by the Project will be targeted toward the poor as a result of the specific design\nfeatures and through self-selection. The Project has also been designed to benefit women.\nWomen will constitute the majority of project beneficiaries, and there are specific interventions\naimed at improving their health.\n130. Self Targeting. Poverty incidence in the project area is 49 percent compared with the\ncountrywide  incidence  of  37  percent.  Because  of  this,  the  Project  will  yield  more  than\nproportionate benefits for the poor. In addition, almost all the project interventions target the\npoor. For example, the Project focuses on maternal and child health. Since the poor in Viet Nam\nhave higher fertility rates than the non-poor the majority of pregnant women, mothers of young\nchildren (aged one and under) and children (aged five and under) are poor. Interventions aimed\nat mothers and children will provide proportionately greater benefits to the poor. More than 70\npercent  of  malnourished  children  are  poor.  Therefore,  interventions  aimed  at  reducing\nmalnutrition will have poor beneficiaries as the majority. Another example is smoking and\ntobacco  use.  The  BCC  campaign  to  reduce  tobacco  use  will  have  the  poor  as  major\nbeneficiaries.\n131. Design Features. The Project has special features to specifically target the poor and will\nreduce poverty in several ways. First, it will focus on improving access to quality health services\nin remote areas, which will reduce the travel and opportunity costs of seeking health services.\nSecond, it will support the government scheme to provide free health cards to 800,000 poor\npersons, in effect reducing the financial barriers to their use of services. Third, the Project will\nsupport interventions to cure and prevent catastrophic and prolonged illnesses, which make\npeople  vulnerable  to  poverty.  Some  of  these  health  conditions  are  accidents  and  injuries,\nHIV/AIDS, TB and cancers. They not only have devastating and irreversible adverse impacts on\nthe poor, but also drag the nonpoor into deep poverty. Finally, the Project will assist the poor by\nhelping to create a financially sustainable, rural-based social health insurance program.", "31\nC. Sustainability\n132.  Since the Project entails a large investment to expand the availability and improve the\nquality of health service provision in 13 provinces, care has been taken to ensure that the\ninvestments are sustained during and after the project period. Most of the additional health\nfacilities will be provided at the district level by rehabilitating the existing DHCs or by enhancing\nthe supply of diagnostic or treatment-related equipment. Some project design features that will\nensure  sustainability  include  the  following:  (i)  wherever  possible,  existing  facilities  will  be\nrenovated rather than new facilities constructed; (ii) civil works, including renovation, will be\ndesigned  to  minimize  maintenance  costs;  (iii)  only  technologically  appropriate  and  locally\nserviceable equipment will be procured; (iv) maintenance programs and schedules for facilities\nand equipment will be developed and carefully monitored; and (v) the Project will involve\ncommunities  in  implementation,  which  will  ensure  community  ownership,  supervision,  and\noptimal use of the facilities.\n133. An analysis of likely scenarios relating to investment costs and estimated recurrent costs\nwas conducted. The results show that under all realistic scenarios, the project provinces will be\nable to obtain the necessary resources to finance the recurrent costs (Appendix 15). Financing\nfor the recurrent costs associated with the project investments will be met through the following\nsources:\n(i)  User charges. Historical trends show that hospital revenue from user charges\nhas increased at a compounded rate of 14 percent from 1991 to 1994 and at a\nrate of 40 percent between 1994 and 1997. Presently, user charges account for\nmore than a third of total hospital expenditure. It is estimated that about 30\npercent of the incremental recurrent costs related to project investments will be\nmet through this source.\n(ii)  Health insurance. Hospital revenues from health insurance reimbursements have\nincreased by an annual rate of more than 30 percent during 1994 and 1998.\nEven with a conservative projection of future growth in these revenues, health\ninsurance is estimated to account for more than 20 percent of hospital revenues\nin the next 10 years.\n(iii)  Free health cards. The new scheme of free health cards for the poor will yield\nadditional funds for the health system. Under the scheme, the Government will\nprovide a subsidy of D30,000 for each health cardholder. This will contribute an\nadditional $1.5 million for financing recurrent costs every year in the 13 project\nprovinces.\n(iv)  Government budget. It was assumed that government budgets would continue to\nincrease by an annual rate of 3 percent in real terms over the next 10 years. In\nview of the fact that provincial health budgets had increased by more than 12\npercent in real terms during the period 1991-1997, this assumption is on the\nconservative side.\nD. Risks\n134. The  project  interventions  involve  very  little  technical  risk.  The  technologies  and\ntechniques  for  providing  effective  PHC  are  well-understood  and  well-tested.  Viet  Nam\u2019s\nexperience in the sector is long and highly successful, demonstrating both implementation", "32\nability and sustained commitment. The major risk to the Project arises from the macroeconomic\nconditions. Sustainability of project investments is contingent on the provision of Government\nbudgets for the health sector. Although the Government has been able to increase health sector\nbudgets in the past, its ability to do so in the future critically depends on the macroeconomic and\nfiscal situation. Any future economic downturn will be a potential risk for the Project.\n135. The  other  project-related  risk  is  the  possible  implementation  delays  caused  by\n(i) inefficient project management structure, disbursement procedures, and fund flow system;\nand  (ii)  inefficient  procurement  procedures  for  civil  works,  drugs,  medical  equipment  and\nsupplies, and consulting services. The risk of delays in implementation has been minimized\nthrough (i) training of CPMU and PPMU officials in procurement and disbursement procedures\nand  project  management;  (ii) a  decentralized  project  management  structure  that  shifts  the\nresponsibility and authority from the central level to the provinces where essential activities such\nas training and supervision will be implemented; and (iii) procurement units of sufficient size at\nthe central and regional levels, staffed by qualified consultants using streamlined procurement\nprocedures.\nVI. ASSURANCES\n136. The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i)  MOH will ensure that, within six months of loan signing, the project management\nstructures will have been fully staffed in accordance with agreements reached at\nappraisal.\n(ii)  MOH will make data from the national health survey available to the CPMU for\nanalysis as soon as possible after completion of the survey. Baseline and target\nvalues  of  the  project  indicators  will  be  established  within  one  year  of  loan\neffectiveness.\n(iii)  Within three years of loan effectiveness, MOH will establish revolving funds for\ndrugs in all rural communes in the 13 provinces, where there is no licensed drug\nstore.\n(iv)  The  provinces  will  ensure  that  the  provincial  health  sector  budget  will  be\nincreased at least by 3 percent in real terms during the project period and that\nthey  allocate  sufficient  O&M  budget  funds  for  the  proposed  facilities  and\nequipment.\n(v)  Within two years from loan effectiveness, MOH will complete its ongoing review\nof  the  existing  drug  policy  and  submit  the  draft  Drug  Law  to  the  National\nAssembly for approval.\n(vi)  Within six months from loan effectiveness, MOH will submit to ADB for review\ndraft national regulations for regional hospitals and after taking into account the\ncomments of ADB, adopt the regulations within one year from loan effectiveness.", "33\n(vii)  Within  two  years  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  develop  policy\nguidelines to reimburse all intercommune polyclinics for services to the health\ncardholders.\n(viii)  After two years of loan effectiveness, the Government will review and revise, if\nappropriate and necessary, the scheme of health cards for the poor. The review\nwill  assess  the  operational  issues  of  the  scheme  including  the  targeting,\neffectiveness, and appropriateness of premium levels.\n(ix)  Within  two  years  from  loan  effectiveness,  MOH  will  review  the  existing\nmechanisms for cost-recovery exemptions for the poor, and after taking into\naccount  ADB\u2019s  views,  take  the  necessary  legal  and  administrative  steps  to\nensure that such mechanisms are implemented more effectively.\n(x)  Within three years of loan effectiveness, the Government will submit a draft\nhealth care policy to ADB for review. The draft policy will address, among other\nthings, improving access to and the cost of public health services to the rural\npoor.  Within four years of the effective date, the Government will have finalized\nthe policy.\n(xi)  Within one year from loan effectiveness, the Government will submit a draft\nordinance (the ordinance) specifying standards and procedures for ensuring food\nsafety to the National Assembly for approval.\n(xii)  Within  one  year  after  the  approval  of  the  ordinance,  MOH  will  develop\nimplementation  guidelines  and  an  action  plan  for  improving  the  capacity  to\nenforce laws on food safety.\nVII.

The objective of the Project is to improve the health status of the population in the\npoorest areas of the country and to provide experience on health development measures that\nmay be applied throughout the country. The project provinces were selected on the bases of\npoor health conditions, weak health infrastructure, relatively high incidence of poverty, and\nabsence of substantial external assistance.\nTable A4: Selected Characteristics of Project Provinces\nCommunes % GDP\nGDP/ Health Communes District\nWithout Growth Communes\nCapita Rural Budget/ Without Hospital Ethnic\nPPrroojveicntce PUerrbcaennat (D19\u201909070a) CGaDpiPta/b (CD1a9\u20190p90i8t0aa) D1o9%c9t8oar PMe1di9d%-9wO8ibafest M1G9irPn9o2uow/sp9t 2%hc BP1e0od0ps0a/ M(%in oProitpie)ds Diff(wincuiotlh.t)iese\nNorthern\nUpland\nHoa Binh 16.1 1,665 1,388 27.7 98 25 -0.6 .53 64.9 60\nPhu Tho 11.6 2,205 1,928 22.5 94 59 1.5 .40 9.4 48\nVinh Phuc 9.6 1,998 1,785 22.2 89 18 1.5 .40 9.4 2\nQuang Ninh 43.4 3,970 2,581 24.9 73 16 1.5 .79 10.7 32\nRed River\nDelta\nNinh Binh 11.5 1,773 1,552 22.1 87 25 1.9 .59 0.5 5\nNorth Central\nQuang Binh 11.8 1,892 1,650 23.1 96 51 -2.6 .57 1.6 25\nCentral Coast\nQuang Ngai 10.1 1,937 1,721 21.9 87 5 10.7 .68 10.8 40\nKhanh Hoa 37.9 4,094 2,785 24.8 75 5 2.7 .53 4.5 17\nSouth East\nBinh Phuoc 14.7 2,279 1,943 25.7 91 0 9.3 .97 8.0 18\nMekong River\nDelta\nLong An 12.8 3,669 3,116 20.2 85 22 10.4 .72 0.6 -\nTien Giang 12.1 3,202 2,784 18.4 85 0 1.8 .13 0.6 -\nBen Tre 7.9 3,142 2,862 19.4 87 15 0.1 .33 0.6 -\nCan Tho 19.9 3,452 2,769 22.1 6 0 2.3 .32 15.0 2\nCountry 21.1 3,568 -- 24.8 76 22 5.3 .54 12.7 249\nConversion rate: $1 =- D14,000.\nGDP = gross domestic product.\na Ministry of Health annual statistics, 1998.\nb Computed using ratio of rural and urban consumption levels from the 1998 Living Standard Survey.\nc National household survey, 1992/93.\nd National population census, 1989.\ne Decision 135/QD-TTg, July 1998 on 1715 Communes for Special Assistance.\n2. To avoid duplication of resources, the first step in selecting the project provinces was to\nexclude provinces that were covered by other major projects. Thirty-nine provinces are already\ncovered by other major projects, namely, the Population and Family Health Project, supported\nby the Asian Development Bank and World Bank, the World Bank-supported National Health\nSupport Project, and the European Union-supported Health Project. These projects are already\nproviding support similar to that envisaged under the present Project.", "42\nAppendix 4, page 2\n3. Of the remaining provinces, the neediest and the poorest were selected. Table A4\nshows that these provinces have greater needs than the country as a whole.  All the project\nprovinces have a proportionately larger rural population than does the country as a whole.\nQuang Ninh and Khanh Hoa show a high urban percentage because of the larger than average\nprovincial capitals in the two provinces. The average GDP/capita is lower than the national\naverage. Again the large city populations in Quang Ninh and Khanh Hoa provinces distort the\naverage for these two areas. However, the estimated income levels in rural areas of the two\nprovinces are significantly lower than the national average. The southern provinces would\nappear to be much better-off or nearly on par with national economic conditions; however, these\ndata are not corrected for a cost-of-living adjustment for higher prices in the south.\n4. Three provinces\u2014Ben Tre, Long An and Quang Ngai\u2014are covered by the Australian\nAgency for International Development-supported Primary Health Care project.  However, this\nproject does not cover all communes and all health areas. The proposed Project will provide\ncomplementary investments and focus on the remaining communes and uncovered health\nareas in these three provinces.\n5. The proportion of communes without doctors clearly shows that most of the project\nprovinces are below the national average in the level of rural resources for health. The most\nsignificant indicator of need and overall development status relative to a national norm is\nreflected in the 1992/93 indicator of rate of GDP growth minus population growth. This indicator\nreflects whether an area is developing at or below its ability to keep up with population growth.\nAs shown for the country as a whole, economic development significantly exceeded the growth\nin population. However, for the project provinces this indicator would reflect that, with the\nexception of three, the provinces are still struggling with their overall economic development.\nHoa Binh and Quang Binh are not only at a lower base than the country as a whole but are\ndropping further behind their neighboring provinces. The three provinces that are exceptions to\nthe rest of the project provinces are all starting from a low base.\n6. Table A4 further shows the status of the project provinces in relation to the government's\ncriterion for communes with needs for special development assistance. The government has\nidentified 1,715 communes in the country that meet this criterion. The project provinces include\n249 (14.5 percent) of the communes that are considered the most needy in the country.", "43\nAppendix 5, page 1\nDETAILS OF CIVIL WORKS\nA. Introduction\n1. The primary objective of the Project is to improve access and increase the quality of care\nfor the poor and disadvantaged in rural areas of the project provinces. One aspect of the\nstrategy to achieve this objective is to improve the physical appearance, functional capability,\nand hygienic conditions of the health facilities, especially at the district level. The civil works\nactivity will upgrade health facilities in the commune health centers, intercommune polyclinics,\nand district health centers to support the achievement of the project objective.\n2. The Project will support upgrading of new or existing facilities based on the following\nguidelines:\n(i)  the design is based on support for a health service need such as improving the\nefficiency  of  services,  improving  the  quality  of  care,  or  increasing  equity  of\nutilization of care;\n(ii)  the design will be financially viable; and\n(iii)  the design is based on a change in service structure that will yield effectiveness\nand efficiency improvements, such as with a new regional district center.\n3. Each facility upgrading plan prepared by the province will show how the civil works\ndesign addresses the above general criteria and meets the following specific criteria for each\ntype of facility.\nB. Intercommune Polyclinics\n4. Intercommune  polyclinics  will  be  strengthened  in  technical  areas,  based  on  needs\ncommon to a number of commune health centers such as:\n(i)  need for field supervision where effectiveness depends on coverage of more\nthan one commune,\n(ii)  need for laboratory and other diagnostic facilities that require higher volumes of\nwork for cost efficiency,\n(iii)  need  for  relatively  intensive  medical  services  to  manage  infectious  and\ncommunicable disease as well as for higher level competencies in maternal and\nchild health care, and\n(iv)  need  for  better  emergency  care  capabilities  for  management  of  common\ndiseases and facilities for patient transport.\n5. Investment  in  civil  works  will  be  targeted  to  support  new  equipment  and  improved\nhygienic conditions for the above functions, normally through modification of existing spaces. A\nwhole diagnostic and treatment block may be built if the design meets the general criteria noted\nabove for civil works not to exceed 150 square meters. Additional civil works may be considered\nbeyond the basic model for polyclinics in mountainous areas and those most remote from\nreferral centers. The polyclinic will have 10-15 beds with supporting equipment based on the\nabove functions. A new polyclinic may be constructed when rehabilitation would cost 60 percent\nor more of a new facility.", "44\nAppendix 5, page 2\nC. District Health Center and Regional Hospital\n6. District health centers will be a priority facility for civil works upgrading and will be\nstrengthened with regard to the following technical and managerial capabilities:\n(i)  improving  field  supervision  (technical  and  managerial)  for  commune  health\ncenters and polyclinics in its area;\n(ii)  providing laboratory and diagnostic services to support health conditions in its\narea;\n(iii)  providing  medical  and  surgical  services  for  managing  care  of  persons\nhospitalized  for  infectious  and  communicable  diseases,  as  well  as  higher\ncompetencies in maternal and child health care; and\n(iv)  providing emergency care for common conditions in the area.\n7. Investment in civil works will be targeted to support the district health centers technical\nand management capabilities for public health operations. District clinical capabilities as a\nhospital may be improved primarily because credible and effective leadership and supervision in\npreventive care are more effective when provided in tandem with reliable and quality curative\ncare. Investment will be made to support new equipment and improve hygienic conditions for\nthe above functions, normally through modification of existing space. A whole diagnostic and\ntreatment block not to exceed 1000 square meters, may be built if the design meets the general\ncivil works criteria noted above. Renovations may be required for proper X-ray, laboratory,\noperating, delivery, centered sterible obstetrics and gynecological services and emergency\nrooms. A district center will not be considered for civil works if it is within 30 minutes\u2019 normal\ntravel time of a provincial hospital.\n8. Special investment consideration will be given to district center proposals that are part of\na provincial regional district plan including the rationalization of current services, reducing some\nservices or providing for new services to meet a changing burden of disease in the community.\nDistrict hospitals, called regional hospitals, will be located in remote areas (at least 2 hours\u2019\ntravel time from the provincial health centers). The investment for the facility will be similar to\nthat for district health center, but with a larger capacity of up to 150 beds. The size of the\nbuilding including the diagnostics, treatment, and inpatient facilities will not exceed 4,000 square\nmeters.", "Appendix 6, page 1\n45\nINDICATIVE LIST OF EQUIPMENT\nA.

Poverty in Viet Nam\n1. Level and Trends. While living conditions in Viet Nam have been improving during the\n1990s, a significant proportion of the country\u2019s population remains poor. A recent World Bank\nstudy1 on poverty in Viet Nam reports that the population living below the poverty line dropped\nfrom 58 percent in 1993 to 37 percent in 1998. While Viet Nam\u2019s achievements in poverty\nreduction are impressive, the gains remain fragile. A significant number of the poor positioned a\nlittle below the poverty line in 1993 improved their living conditions to cross the poverty line and\nwere  clustered  just  above  the  poverty  line.  A  relatively  small  deterioration  in  their  living\nstandards\u2014triggered by community-wide, household or individual crises\u2014would be sufficient to\npush them below the poverty line again.\n2. Characteristics  of  the  Poor.  Poverty  in  Viet  Nam  is  closely  linked  to  access  to\neconomic opportunities, education levels, and ethnicity. Poverty is largely a rural phenomenon,\nwith 90 percent of the poor living in rural areas and about 45 percent of rural people living below\nthe poverty line. The income differential between rural and urban areas is significant and\nwidening. In 1998, the median household income in rural areas amounted to D2.3 million,\nwhereas  in  urban  areas  it  was  D5.1  million,  more  than  2  times  larger.  Not  surprisingly,\neducational status is one of the important determinants of poverty. In 1998, 57 percent of those\nwithout any education were poor, whereas only 25 percent of those who had attained an upper\nsecondary education were poor. Among the more educated, the percentage of the poor was\neven lower (4 percent among university graduates). Poverty is concentrated among small-scale\nagriculturists or those who are unemployed. Finally, over half (51 percent) of the poor live in\nmountainous or isolated areas of either the north or central highlands or the north coast regions.\nThese are the areas of the country where most of the ethnic minorities reside.\nB. Health Status and Poverty\n3. Poverty  and  health  status  are  closely  associated  in  Viet  Nam.  The  occurrence  of\nillness\u2014leading to loss of labor resources and significant costs for curative health care and\nassociated expenditure\u2014is reportedly one of the prominent causes of poverty. Studies show\nthat once a household loses an adult member to sickness or disability, income levels suddenly\ndrop  and  the  household  slides  into  poverty.  Most  of  the  poor  are  self-employed  in  small\nbusiness or agriculture, or depend on daily wages. Unlike people with fixed salaries, the self-\nemployed poor find the opportunity cost of sickness and treatment a heavy burden. The direct\ncost of treatment has in fact grown tremendously during the period after doi moi (transition from\nthe centrally planned economy to the market economy).\n4. While sickness and ill health lead to poverty, health indicators for the poor tend to be\nworse than those for the nonpoor. Some selected health indicators (Table A13.1) demonstrate\nthis link. The burden of disease\u2014as measured by the disability adjusted life years (DALYs) lost\nper thousand people\u2014among the poorest rural young children is more than 27 times the rate\nexperienced by those in urban areas. For the entire population, the poor rural population has a\nfourfold greater disease burden than do urban dwellers.\n                                                          \n1 World Bank. 1999. Vietnam Development Report 2000, Attacking Poverty: Country Economic Memorandum.\nReport No. 19914-VN. Washington D.C.: World Bank.", "Appendix 13, page 2\n60\n5. Malnutrition among children less than 4 years is nearly three times greater for the rural\npoor than for urban dwellers. Tobacco use\u2014an indicator of future chronic health problem\u2014is\ngreater among the poor than among the nonpoor. For example, about 58 percent men in the\npoorest quintile use tobacco products compared with 43 percent in the richest quintile. The\naverage duration of illness restricting normal activity is greater among the poor than among to\nthe well-off\u201417.5 percent greater in rural areas and 33 percent in urban areas.\n6. In 1998, the infant mortality rate (IMR) among the rural poor areas of the Project was\nnearly 54 percent greater than that in all rural areas and fourfold greater than that in urban\nareas. In part, this difference reflects the relative availability of MCH services. Similarly, in the\nmid-1990s, life expectancy was over 10 years longer in the more urban and relatively affluent\nRed River Delta region (70.8 years) than that in the poorer and mountainous central highlands\n(60.5 years).\nTable A13.1: Health Status and Poverty\nHealth Indicator Urban Rural Rural Poor\n1.

Economic Analysis of Proposed ADB/MOH Rural Health Project.\nC. Health Care Utilization\n7. While the poor suffer from the heaviest disease burden, they are also less likely to seek\nhealth care. They use poorer quality service providers compared with the nonpoor. Table A13.2\nshows that the affluent seek health care services 45 percent more frequently than do the\npoorest group. If contacts with drug vendors are excluded, this difference is further magnified.\nThe affluent seek care nearly twice as often as the poorest (4.6 times compared with 2.4 times\nper person per year).\n8. When sick, the poor often do not seek any health care, mainly due to the large direct and\nindirect costs. More than 30 percent of poor people in the project area reported that they did not\nseek health care when they last fell sick. When they did seek services, it was often from drug\nvendors and commune health centers, whereas the affluent went more often to public hospitals\nand private physician clinics. The personnel in health facilities where the poor tend to seek care\nare usually less trained and less capable of providing high-quality service. Hospital use is highly\nskewed toward the affluent, with the admission rate nearly twice as high for the affluent as for\nthe poorest group. The affluent also tend to have longer hospital stays, in part due to their\nhigher health insurance coverage.", "61\nAppendix 13, page 3\nTable A13.2: Health Service Use in Viet Nam,\nby Expenditure Quintile, 1998\nHealth Service Use Indicator Poorest Second Third Fourth Richest\nPer Capita Contacts with All Providers 7.9 10.5 11.3 10.6 11.4\nPer Capita Health Service Contacts (excluding 2.4 3.2 3.8 3.7 4.6\nDrug Vendors)\nShare of Contacts at Public Hospitals 3.2 3.8 4.6 7.2 9.6\nShare of Contacts at Commune Health Centers 7.4 6.8 6.9 5.6 1.7\nShare of Contacts at Private Clinics 15.8 15.4 22.8 18.5 24.2\nShare of Visits to Drug Vendors 69.3 69.7 66.6 64.8 59.4\nInpatient Admission Rate/1,000 person/year 33.9 43.5 49.3 61.9 63.3\nAverage Length of Stay 10.3 10.9 13.9 14.6 18.8\nD. Health Financing by the Poor and the Nonpoor\n9. Not only are the poor less healthy, seek care less frequently from health care providers\nand from poorer quality providers, they also spend considerable sums on the health care they\ndo use. This is partly because a smaller proportion of the poor have health insurance coverage\ncompared with the nonpoor (Table A13.3). Although, the poor spend a smaller amount on health\ncare,  the  expense  is  much  more  onerous  for  they  pay  a  larger  share  of  their  nonfood\nexpenditure for health care. Even a single contact with the public hospital represents as much\nas 22 percent of the annual nonfood expenditure for a person from the poorest quintile. Health\ninsurance coverage is also the lowest among the poorest groups\u2014with 1 in 20 covered in the\npoorest group as opposed to about 1 in 3 for the affluent. To assist the poor in gaining better\nfinancial  access  to  health  care,  their  health  insurance  coverage  needs  to  be  significantly\nincreased.\nTable A13.3: Fees, Relative Cost of Selected Health Services, and Health Insurance\nCoverage of the Poor and the Affluent in Viet Nam, 1998\nConsumption Quintile\nIndicator Poorest Second Third Fourth Richest\nPer Capita Expenditure (D\u2018000) 1.219 1.767 2.251 3.073 6.259\nShare of Nonfood Expenditure per Contact     22.0 21.8 17.6 12.2 4.6\nat Public Hospital (%)\nShare of Persons with Health Insurance 6.2 9.5 13.5 18.9 28.7\n(%)\nShare of rural population with health 5.8 9.3 11.8 16.4 19.5\ninsurance (%)\nE. Project Assistance to the Poor\n10. The Project will be implemented in 13 provinces, where 49 percent of the population are\npoor compared with the countrywide poverty incidence of 37 percent. Because of the high\nincidence of poverty in the project provinces, the Project will provide more than proportionate\nbenefits  to the poor. In addition, almost all the project interventions will self-target the poor. The\nmajority of the project beneficiaries will be poor. The Project has special features to assist the\npoor and has been designed to reduce poverty by (i) improving access to health services for the\npoor, (ii) improving the affordability of health services to the poor, (iii) investing in health issues\nthat disproportionately affect the poor, (iv) investing in prevention of health conditions that make", "Appendix 13, page 4\n62\nthe people vulnerable to poverty, and (v) developing model approaches for comprehensive\nhealth insurance.\n11. Improving Access. The Project will seek to enhance the health status of the poor by\nimproving services and ensuring that these are more accessible. The poor tend to live in more\nremote areas. They are also typically self-employed in small business enterprises or work for\ndaily wages. By reducing geographic distances to better health facilities at the commune,\nintercommune, and district levels, the project will mainly benefit the poor whose travel and\nopportunity costs in seeking health care will be reduced.\n12. Increasing Affordability. The Project will support the government scheme to provide\nfree health cards to the poor, which will benefit them by reducing the financial barriers to their\nuse of services. The approximately 800,000 free health cardholders in the project area will\ndirectly benefit from the project interventions.\n13. Supporting Health Issues Affecting the Poor. The Project will improve the quality of\nspecific  health  care  services,  including  those  related  to  maternal  and  child  health  and\ndiagnostics. In addition, the Project will focus on malnutrition, smoking, and reproductive health\nin its behavior change communication component. All these interventions will provide more than\nproportionate benefits to the poor, since they are more likely to be affected by these health\nconditions. For example, more than 50 percent of children and pregnant women in the project\narea are poor. The majority of beneficiaries from intervention for reproductive health or maternal\nand child health services are likely to be poor. Similarly, more than 70 percent of malnourished\nchildren are poor and the majority of tobacco users are poor. Clearly, interventions focusing on\nthese issues will be pro-poor.\n14. Prevention. Catastrophic and prolonged illnesses have been found to drag households\ninto  poverty.  Some  of  these  health  conditions  are  accidents  and  injuries,  HIV/AIDS,2\ntuberculosis,  and  cancers.  Project  interventions  for  emergency  services,  surgery,  and\ndiagnostics  will  assist  in  providing  timely  care  for  accident-related  and  other  emergency\nconditions and in timely identification and cure of long-term illnesses. At the same time, the\nbehavior change communication component of the Project will assist in preventing HIV/AIDS\nand injuries. These interventions will prevent the poor from becoming further marginalized, and\nthe nonpoor from sliding into poverty.\n15. Health Insurance. The Project will assist the poor by helping to create a financially\nsustainable rural-based social health insurance program, which over time might be extended to\nother parts of the country. This new social health insurance program will eventually cover all\nrural families, regardless of economic status. It will be partly financed in the short term by\nsupport from the Project as well as from a number of other sources, including public subsides\nfrom  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  other  ministries,  and  from  the  community.  The  targeted\nsubsidies from the project will facilitate the development of a sustainable health insurance\nmechanism through which the poor would gain access to the health care services they need to\nmaintain and improve health status.\n                                                          \n2 human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.", "Appendix 14, page 1\n63\nSUMMARY ETHNIC MINORITIES DEVELOPMENT PLAN1\nA. Socioeconomic Profile of Ethnic Minority Groups\n1.  The objective of the Ethnic Minority Development Plan (EMDP) is to ensure that the\nethnic minority population, especially women and children, in the 13 project provinces will have\nequal access to health benefits and community participation opportunities provided by the\nProject. In general, ethnic minority groups, especially those in rural remote and mountainous\nareas, are among the most disadvantaged subgroups of Vietnamese society. Their access to\neconomic resources and social services, and their capacity to absorb opportunities, are limited.\nPoverty incidence among them is 75 percent, much higher than the national average of 37\npercent.2 Social indicators show stark gaps between the ethnic minorities and the national\naverage. According to the 1997 Demographic and Health Survey, the percentage of women of\nreproductive age without formal education was 27.7 percent among ethnic minorities, much\nhigher than 2.0 percent for the urban population and 6.4 percent for the rural population. This\nfinding has the prevailing major implications for the health status of family members. These\nwomen are also far more disadvantaged in terms of their access to socioeconomic infrastructure\nand services.\n2. There are 53 ethnic minority groups in Viet Nam, comprising around 13 percent of the\ntotal national population. The main groups are Tay (1.8 percent), Thai (1.5 percent), Hoa (1.4\npercent), Khmer (1.3 percent), Muong (1.3 percent), and Nung (1.1 percent); they make up two\nthirds of the total ethnic minority population. Among the 13 project provinces, 3 have high\nconcentrations of ethnic minority groups: northern highlands (Hoa Binh, Phu Tho, and Quang\nNinh), Quang Ngai Province in central coast region, and Binh Phuoc Province in the southeast\nregion (see Table A14).\n3. The main ethnic minority groups in the northern mountainous project provinces are the\nMuong, Thai, Tay, Dao, and San Diu. Most of them belong to the Austrasiatic linguistic family,\nincluding the Viet-Muong linguistic group (e.g., Muong, Viet), H\u2019mong-Dao linguistic group (e.g.,\nH\u2019mong, Dao), and Tay-Thai linguistic group (e.g. Tay, Thai, Nung San Chay). The San Diu\nbelongs to the Chinese-descendent Han linguistic group together with the Hoa. The most typical\ncharacteristic  of  the  ethnic  groups  in  the  northern  mountainous  provinces  is  their  mixed\nresidence across ethnic groups, although topography determines a general locational pattern for\neach group. While there are employment opportunities in mining, hydroelectric power plants,\nand forestry enterprises in some of the northern mountainous provinces, the ethnic minorities\ndepend mainly on subsistence agriculture (rice and other food crops) and small-scale livestock\nraising, with some engaging in shifting cultivation. In some places, they also grow fruit crops or\nmedicinal herbs.\n4. The main ethnic minority groups in the central coastal project provinces are the Hre, Co,\nand Ra Glai. The Hre and Co belong to the Mon-Khmer linguistic group, while the Ra Glai\nbelong to the Malayo-Polynesian linguistic family. These groups are concentrated in the western\nhighlands of the provinces, which are difficult to access. Unlike the northern mountains ethnic\nminorities, the central ethnic minority groups tend to live in separate communities.

Living on the border with Cambodia, the majority of the ethnic minority groups in Binh\nPhuoc  Province  in  the  Southeast  belong  to  the  Mon-Khmer  linguistic  group,  including  the\nStieng, Kho Mu and M\u2019nong. These groups engage mainly in subsistence or shifting agriculture.\nSome (especially the Stieng) have had to adjust to the modern lifestyle that the migrating Kinh\nhave brought in.\nB. Health Status of Ethnic Minority Groups in the Project Provinces\n6. The health status of the ethnic minorities is the most challenging among all the target\ngroups, due to their general poverty, difficulties in outreach, their lack of awareness combined\nwith high illiteracy rates, and, in many cases, health services that do not address their culturally\nsensitive needs and constraints. Their most common health problems leading to morbidity and\nmortality are communicable diseases (e.g., malaria, goiter, helminthiasis), nutritional deficiency,\nand poor perinatal and maternal conditions. Women of reproductive age bear the heaviest\nburden of diseases. The estimated maternal mortality among ethnic minorities is four times\nhigher than the national average of 160-200 per 100,000 live births, and some data show even\nhigher  figures  for  some  ethnic  groups  (e.g.,  1,080  for  Stieng  in  Binh  Phuoc  Province).\nReproductive health problems are common among ethnic minority women. Their contraceptive\nprevalence rate is lower than the national average. Among children, those under five years of\nage  bear  the  heaviest  burden  of  ill  health.  Infant  mortality,  child  malnutrition,  respiratory\ninfections, and prevalence of diarrhea are all higher among ethnic minority groups than the\nnational average.", "Appendix 14, page 3\n65\n7. In general, the health needs of ethnic minority groups, especially women and children,\nare for more affordable, closer, and better quality services. However, there is wide variation in\nhealth seeking behavior between ethnic groups and even within the same group, depending on\ntheir economic status, the severity of the disease, distance to health care services, level of\nhealth and hygiene awareness, and culture and religious beliefs.  The utilization level of both\ntraditional and modern medicine also varies. A case-by-base approach is required to tackle\nsuch diverse needs. In addition, since these target groups belong to the low and very low\nsocioeconomic strata, they are inevitably preoccupied with the immediate needs of improving\nincome, and family health care is given lower priority. Therefore, raising their awareness about\nhygiene and primary health care is also important, to generate greater demand for health\nservices.\nC.  Project Strategy and Components\n8. The project EMDP will support and strengthen the ongoing Government strategy for\nethnic minorities in the health sector, including Program 135 and Program 133 as part of the\nHunger Eradication and Poverty Reduction (HEPR) Program, while adding new components\nthat are specific to the Project. To achieve the goal of the EMDP, the Project will (i) mainstream\nspecial cultural and socioeconomic needs and concerns of ethnic minority women and children\ninto all project activities, and (ii) provide ethnic minority-specific services and facilities.\n9. The mainstreaming strategy will be implemented through the following components:\n(i)  guidelines and training responsive to the special needs of ethnic minority women\nand children (components A.1, A.3);\n(ii)  upgraded  or  new  health  facilities  and  equipment  taking  into  account  easier\nphysical access by ethnic minority groups (A.2);\n(iii)  improved quality of health system and project management (B.2, B.3);\n(iv)  community-based  approach  responsive  to  diverse  needs  of  ethnic  minority\ncommunities (B.2, C.3);\n(v)  improved  awareness-raising  activities  on  primary  health  care  through\nstrengthened behavioral change communication (BCC) activities (C.2, C.3); and\n(vi)  more affordable access to public health care through free health cards for the\npoor (B.1).\n10. The  ethnic  minority-specific  strategy  will  be  implemented  through  the  following\ncomponents:\n(i)  establishment  of  herbal  gardens  at  commune  health  centers  where  relevant\n(A.2);\n(ii)  training of traditional birth attendants (A.3);\n(iii)  production  of  ethnic  minority  handbook  for  commune  and  village  health\nstaff/workers (C.2); and\n(iv)  translation of BCC materials into ethnic minority languages where possible (C.2).", "Appendix 15, page 1\n66\nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSES\nA. Rationale for Public Investment in Viet Nam\u2019s Rural Health Sector\n1. Economic Returns\n1. There is a strong economic rationale for public investment in the rural health sector.\nInvestment in the health status of people and prevention of diseases in the project area will yield\nthe following economic gains:\n(i)  Productivity. The project interventions are likely to save at least 1 million healthy\nlife years within 10 years of project completion. Improvements in health status\nwill lead to improved productivity. Data from the 1998 Viet Nam Living Standards\nSurvey show that the economic cost of the number of days lost due to sickness\namounts to about 8.7 percent of gross domestic product. If a healthy life year is\nvalued at per capita gross national product, the project interventions will lead to\naddition of at least $330 million to the national income over 10 years from project\ncompletion.\n(ii)  Savings. Prevention of diseases will result in substantial savings in the direct and\nopportunity costs of treating the prevented illness. The total private expenditure\non health care in the project provinces amounts to about $400 million every year.\nA 10 percent reduction in sickness will mean a saving of $40 million per annum in\nthe direct cost of health care, and much more if the indirect costs are included.\n(iii)  Intergenerational  benefits.  Benefits  from  the  Project  go  beyond  the  existing\ngeneration, since improvements in the health status of mothers and prevention of\nHIV/AIDS1 promise better health for the children. Studies show that a mother\u2019s\ndeath significantly reduces the survival probability and well-being of the child.\nThe Project interventions are likely to prevent at least 1,000 maternal deaths in\n10 years after project completion.\n(iv)  Healthy children. The project interventions are expected to prevent about 26,000\ninfant deaths and improve the health status of millions of children during and 10\nyears after the project period. Better health and nutritional status in childhood\nleads to better cognitive and learning abilities. Thus the project investments will\nmean better returns on investment in children. In addition, reduction in infant\nmortality will also lead to better population planning.\n2. Role of the Government\n2. The question arises as to why the Government should invest in the proposed services\nand not leave it to the market forces. There are clearly identified areas of market failures in\nproviding and financing rural health services in Viet Nam. In the absence of public investment,\nthe availability and use of these services will be inadequate. The main economic arguments for\na proactive role for the Government are as follows:\n(i)  Primary health services are mostly public goods or have large externalities and,\ntherefore, will not be adequately provided by the private sector;\n                                                          \n1 human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.", "Appendix 15, page 2\n67\n(ii)  Primary health services are marked by uncertainty and incomplete information\nleading to low levels of demand and poor supply response from the private\nsector; and\n(iii)  Failure of insurance markets puts the cure for catastrophic health conditions,\nsuch  as  delivery  complications  and  accidents,  out  of  the  reach  of  common\npeople, thus necessitating public intervention.\n3. Public Good and Externalities. Many of the planned interventions such as prevention\nof food adulteration, and behavior change communication to reduce tobacco use and prevent\naccidents are public goods. Since these services can be used by anyone without paying, the\nprivate  sector  does  not  have  any  incentive  to  provide  them.  In  the  absence  of  public\nintervention,  such  services  will  simply  not  exist.  Other  proposed  interventions  have  large\npositive externalities, i.e., the social benefits of using these services are far greater than the\nprivate benefits. For example, immunization against a communicable disease not only protects\nthe individual but also contributes toward creating herd immunity and breaking the infection\ntransmission chain, and thus protects the entire community. Similarly, improved reproductive\nhealth services lead to lower fertility, which may reduce expenditure and encourage higher\nsavings and investments, enhancing the overall standard of living. However, individuals would\nnot take into account these spin-off benefits when deciding to use or provide these services. In\nthe absence of public financing, therefore, the effective demand for and provision of these\nservices are likely to be below the socially optimal levels.\n4. Lack of Information. Communities and families in rural areas often lack information\nabout the availability of services and the need for using these services. They learn from their\nown experiences rather than through modern research findings. Lack of information about\nmodern medical practices leads to a poor demand for health services, especially among the\npoor and disadvantaged. This also results in a poor supply response from the private sector,\nsince it does not consider providing health services in rural areas sufficiently remunerative.\nClearly, the Government has a critical role to play in providing information, generating demand\nand demonstrating benefits from modern medical practices.\n5. Absence of Insurance Markets. Another type of market failure that affects the health\nstatus of people relates to the failure of the rural insurance system. The high cost of emergency\ncare  at  the  tertiary  level  is  a  major  constraint  to  utilization  of  these  services  in  case  of\nemergencies. Faced with such emergency cases, families cannot decide on the timely referral\nto a tertiary hospital before it is too late. These price constraints potentially affect all but the\nrichest families. Effective risk pooling mechanisms through insurance systems do not exist to\nprevent increasingly frequent and fatal cases that require emergency and expensive care. The\ngovernment provision of services is the only alternative in the absence of effective insurance\nsystems in the rural areas.\n3.  Poverty Reduction\n6. Perhaps the most important economic justification for the Project is the equity or want-of-\nmerit rationale. While the doi moi policy has expanded economic opportunities for many and has\nassisted in achieving rapid economic growth, it has not sufficiently benefited certain sections of\nthe population. The poor and people living in remote areas do not have sufficient human capital\nto benefit from the opportunities created by economic liberalization. While these groups have\ngained little from these policies, the declining investments in social sectors and introduction of\nuser fees have increased the inequities in access to health services. They have also stretched", "Appendix 15, page 3\n68\nthe social solidarity of the country to a breaking point. Today, rural people do not have the same\naccess as urban dwellers to either publicly operated or private health services. At the same\ntime,  rural  dwellers,  especially  the  poor,  generally  have  a  lower  health  status  than  urban\ndwellers. Moreover, the inequities in access to health services and health status have in fact\nwidened in the last few years. The Government has initiated several social safety net programs\nto provide a minimum floor of social services for all persons dwelling in Viet Nam, and, is\nseeking  to  rebuild  the  past  strong  sense  of  social  solidarity.  However,  without  external\nassistance, government resources will not be adequate to cover both demand- and supply-side\nconstraints faced by the poor. The Project will assist the government in reducing poverty by\nimproving the access of the poor to health services (a detailed discussion is in Appendix 13).\nB. Will the Proposed Project Crowd Out Private Spending?\n7. According  to  the  Health  Sector  Review,  health  sector  private  investment  has  not\ngenerally been located in rural areas, especially in the most impoverished areas2. Thus, to the\nextent that the project is targeting its investments to impoverished rural areas, it is not likely to\ncrowd  out  private  spending  in  the  health  sector.  The  majority  of  the  proposed  hospital\ninvestments will be in rural district facilities. The average rural per capita income is about 55\npercent lower than the urban income. So far, only three private hospitals have actually become\noperational  in  urban  areas  in  Viet  Nam.  Thus,  the  demand  for  hospital-based  care,  while\ngrowing, has not yet reached the point where private payments can fully support the financial\ncosts of operating a hospital facility, especially in a rural area. A recent study shows that, in Viet\nNam, investments in public facilities strengthen the private sector instead of crowding it out. It\nhappens because a large number of public health care providers also work for the private\nsector. Therefore, improving the skills of the public sector workers through training indirectly\nimproves  the  quality  of  private  sector  services.  Increased  competition  from  public  sector\nhospitals encourages the private sector to improve quality.\nC. Project Beneficiaries\n8. The 13 project provinces have a population of 15 million, of whom 12.7 million live in\nrural areas. The Project will improve access to quality health services for the rural population,\nthereby directly or indirectly improving their health status. Beneficiaries will include 3 million\nwomen in the reproductive age group, 1.3 million people from ethnic minorities, 6.2 million poor\npeople, 2 million children, and 1.5 million elderly. The Project will benefit about 1.5 million\npregnant women and 1.3 million newborn children during the project period. In addition, the\nproject interventions will directly benefit about 800,000 poor people through free health cards.\nD. Cost-Effectiveness  and  Benefit/Cost  Assessment  of  Proposed  Project\nInterventions\n9. The cost-effectiveness of project investments was analyzed with alternative scenarios\nfor the flow of benefits and costs. Project benefits and costs are going to accrue well beyond the\nproject period. This analysis takes a time horizon of 20 years, beyond which disease patterns\nand medical technologies can be assumed to significantly differ from the present situation.\nMoreover, any net flow from the period after 20 years will have only a very small net present\nvalue.\n                                                          \n2  See Chapter 5, Health Sector Review, op. cit., 1999.", "Appendix 15, page 4\n69\n10. Valuation of Benefits. In this analysis, the project outcomes of health improvements\nare assessed by quantifying the burden of disease by the number of disability adjusted life years\n(DALYs) lost due to premature illness, disability, and death. Reductions in the disease burden\u2014\nthe number of DALYs saved during and after the project period\u2014represent a direct estimate of\nthe project impact. The disease burden for Viet Nam for 1999 was estimated based on the\nrecent work of Western Pacific Region of the WHO3 and the earlier work of C. Murray and A\nLopez of WHO/Geneva4.\n11. It was assumed that without the project investments, the current rate of improvement in\nlife expectancy will decline over time to a level about one half the rate experienced over the\nprevious 25 years. This assumption is justified on the basis that earlier investments in the health\nsystem and social sectors would have already run their course. With the project investments,\nthree benefit scenarios were investigated.\n(i)  Low  scenario.  Since  the  Project  will  rehabilitate  the  old  primary  health  care\ninfrastructure, the rate of increase in life expectancy would equal the previous\ntrend rate. In other words, the past rate of reduction in DALYs will be maintained\nin the future.\n(ii)  Moderate Scenario. This scenario assumes that the rate of DALY reduction is 10\npercent greater than the previous trend rate.\n(iii)  High scenario. This scenario assumes that the rate of DALY reduction achieved\nby the project investments is 30 percent greater than the previous trend rate.\n12. Valuation of Cost. The costs considered in this analysis include the five-year project\ncapital and recurrent costs, plus an additional 15 years of recurrent costs to continue operating\neach project component that extends or refurbishes services, or improves service quality or\nmanagement. While the project capital costs are known, recurrent costs during and after the\nproject period are difficult to estimate with certainity. These recurrent costs will be substantially\ninfluenced by the change in utilization pattern of health services after the Project. For the\nanalysis, the relationship between project capital costs and subsequent recurrent costs, as\ndefined by the \u201cr\u201d coefficient, is assumed to be similar to what has occurred in other developing\ncountries.  The  \u201cr\u201d  coefficient  has  been  found  to  vary  between  0.2  and  0.4  in  most  other\ncountries for the types of investment envisioned in the Project.5\n13. Benefit-Cost  and  Cost-Effectiveness  Analyses.  Several  benefit-cost  and  cost-\neffectiveness analyses were conducted. These were based on the cost and burden of disease\n(BOD) reduction analyses defined above, assumptions regarding the rate of time preference (or\ndiscount rate), and the relationship between capital and subsequent recurrent costs. The results\nare summarized in Table A15.1.\n14. The cost-effectiveness of the project interventions is estimated in the range of $12-$45\nper  DALY  saved  depending  on  the  assumption.

The range of cost-effectiveness ratios\nfound in the analysis is well within the acceptable range considered by the World Bank in its\n1993 World Development Report of $20\u2013$30. The second part of Table A15.1 shows that the\nproposed investment will yield considerably greater returns in terms of economic growth than\nthe attendant costs. At the 3 percent discount rate, the benefits are expected to be greater than\nthe capital and recurrent costs by a factor of 11 to 21. The results suggest that, assessed in its\nentirety, the project is highly cost-effective relative to most investments not only outside, but\nalso within the health sector.\nTable A15.1: Summary of Benefit-Cost and Cost-Effectiveness Analyses\nAlternative Discount Rate\nScenario 3% 5% 7% 10%\nA.

Project Sustainability\n15. To financially sustain the project activities, the government and communities should be\nable to provide and allocate the necessary recurrent costs. An analysis was undertaken to\nassess the recurrent cost implications of the project activities and the capacity of the central and\nprovincial governments and communities for pay for such costs.\n                                                          \n6  Asian Development Bank. 1999. Handbook for the Economic Analysis of Health Sector Projects. Rep. RETA 5761.\nManila: ADB.", "71\nAppendix 15, page 6\n16. Estimation of Recurrent Costs. As discussed above, it is difficult to estimate with\nprecision the recurrent costs of facilities planned under the Project. Studies in other countries\nwith similar socioeconomic status have shown that recurrent costs in hospitals are typically 20-\n40 percent (r-value of 0.2 to 0.4) of the capital costs. Since the project investments relate to\nprimary health care and are located in poor areas of the country, it would be safe to assume that\nthe recurrent costs would be on the lower side of the observed range. Therefore, analysis was\nundertaken for r-value of 0.2 and 0.3. On these assumptions, the recurrent cost liabilities of the\nProject after the project period are shown in Table A15.2. The estimates show that the liabilities\nare relatively low in Tien Giang and high in Hoa Binh.\n17. Financing of Recurrent Costs. Four main sources for financing the recurrent cost\nassociated with the project investments were considered: (i) out-of-pocket expenditure through\nuser charges, (ii) health insurance, (iii) free health cards, and (iv) government budgets. Trend\ndata from 1992-1997 was used to predict the value of available resources during and after the\nproject period. The revenue from the various sources was estimated as follows:\n(i)  User charges. Revenue from user charges increased at a compounded rate of 14\npercent from 1991 to 1994 and at a rate of 40 percent between 1994 and 1997. It\naccounts for more than a third of total hospital expenditure. It was assumed that\nuser charges would continue to provide one third of the operating costs of the\nupgraded hospitals.\n(ii)  Health  insurance.  Hospitals  revenue  from  health  insurance  reimbursements\nincreased by an annual rate of more than 30 percent during 1994 and 1998. It\nwas assumed that these revenues would continue to grow by 20 percent in the\nnext 10 years. The assumption of reduced growth in reimbursement revenue is\nbased on the belief that enrollment of new members will not grow at the same\nrate as before due to market saturation.\n(iii)  Free health cards. The new scheme of free health cards for the poor will provide\nadditional funds for the health system. It was assumed that the entire subsidy of\nD30,000 per person would be used by the health system. This is plausible since\nthe average per capita reimbursement of the usual health insurance scheme is\nmore than D50,000.\n(iv)  Government budget. It was assumed that government budgets would continue to\nincrease by an annual rate of 3 percent in real terms over the next 10 years.\nSince the rate of increase has been more than 3 percent in the last few years,\nthis assumption is on the conservative side.\n18. Analysis shows that the Government has the capacity to sustain the project investments\nbeyond the project period. From the above projections, the recurrent cost estimates for r = 0.2\nwould constitute less than 1 percent of provincial GDP in all provinces and 3-10 percent of the\nhealth budget. Since the facilities to be upgraded under the Project cover about 90 percent of\nthe  population,  allocation  of  these  budget  amounts  for  maintaining  the  facilities  would  be\njustified. Moreover, if we assume that the health budgets will grow by more than 3 percent,\nwhich is a likely scenario, the proportion of the budget required to be allocated to sustain the\nproject inputs would be even less. Even with r =0.3, the recurrent cost liabilities range from 5 to\n15 percent, which is clearly affordable. However, the recurrent cost implications in Binh Phuoc\nand Hoa Binh are clearly much higher than in the other provinces. The two are among the\npoorest provinces and have relatively weaker health infrastructure. Therefore, special attention", "Appendix 15, page 7\n72\nwould need to be paid to ensuring that government budgets adequately increased in these\nprovinces to support the project inputs.\nTable A15.2: Recurrent Cost of the Project\nProject Recurrent Cost Recurrent Cost\nShare of Health\nProvince Liabilities in 2006 Liabilities After Cost Share of GDP\nBudget\n(D per Capita) Recovery (percent)\n(percent)\n(D per Capita)\nr = 0.2 r = 0.3 r = 0.2 r = 0.3 r = 0.2 r = 0.3 r = 0.2 r = 0.3\nHoa Binh 13,640 20460 9,548 14,322 0.39 0.59 10 15\nPhu Tho 7,645 11,468 5,352 8,028 0.19 0.28 5 8\nVinh Phuc 8,317 12,475 5,822 8,732 0.22 0.33 6 10\nQuang Ninh 8,319 12,478 5,823 8,735 0.12 0.18 5 7\nNinh Binh 9,847 14,770 6,893 10,339 0.27 0.40 6 10\nQuang Binh 8,424 12,637 5,897 8,846 0.24 0.36 6 9\nQuang Ngai 6,148 9,222 4,303 6,455 0.17 0.26 5 7\nKhanh Hoa 7,362 11,043 5,153 7,730 0.10 0.14 5 8\nBinh Phuoc 12,085 18,128 8,460 12,689 0.28 0.42 10 15\nLong An 6,375 9,562 4,462 6,694 0.09 0.13 5 7\nTien Giang 4,580 6,870 3,206 4,809 0.08 0.11 3 5\nBen Tre 7,070 10,605 4,949 7,424 0.13 0.20 6 8\nCan Tho 4,891 7,337 3,424 5,136 0.07 0.11 4 6"], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20001021094749", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Author": "jm9", "Creator": "ADOBEPS4.DRV Version 4.10", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R233-00rrp.doc", "ModDate": "D:20010109175816+08'00'"}}
