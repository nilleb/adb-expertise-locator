INTRODUCTION \n1.  Environmental  degradation  aggravates  poverty  and  makes  growth  unsustainable.1 \nRecognizing  the  links  between  health,  poverty,  and  polluted  environment,2 Strategy  20203 \nreiterates  the  need  to  assist  developing  member  countries  in  addressing  environmental \nproblems. Environmental damage not only reduces quality of life, but has significant costs for \npublic health\u2014with the poor most severely affected. Pollution-related morbidity and mortality, \nincluding  productivity  losses\u2014notably  among  infants,  young  children,  and  women\u2014are \npervasive in the region.  \n \n2.  The technical assistance (TA), Improving the Health Status of Vulnerable Communities \nThreatened  by  Legacy  or  Artisanal  Pollution,  will  focus  on  the  adverse  health  impacts  of \nindustrial  pollution  sites,  in  particular  those  in  which  the  polluter  responsible  is  either  not \navailable (legacy pollution) or too small (often of the artisanal variety) to be charged with the \ncosts of cleanup. These toxic sites are usually in poor neighborhoods; affect millions of people \n(especially children); and give rise to birth defects, genetic problems, mental retardation, and \ncancers. They often are not identified by health and environment officials and the public. The TA \naims to raise awareness of the problem and explore possible solutions to address these issues \nin the region. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Polluted sites can be found in all poor countries, and industrial areas with poor pollution \ncontrols can be found in many developing countries. Wastes from the chemical, metallurgical, \nand processing sectors frequently contain toxic substances such as heavy metals, solvents, and \norganic compounds. Illegal dump sites of various chemical toxins can be found in urban and \nsuburban areas; they frequently pollute local water supply and may enter the food chain. Many \nresidents of areas around tanneries and stainless steel factories must rely on groundwater \npolluted  with  cancer-causing  hexavalent  chromium  as  their  only  choice  for  drinking  water. \nInformal and unregulated battery processing facilities pollute urban areas with lead. These \npollutants affect the lives and health of people mainly in the developing world, where regulations \nare weak and enforcement difficult.  \n \n4.  The damaging health effects of toxic substances are well known: drastically shortened \nlife spans, retarded mental and physical development, cancers, respiratory diseases, stomach \nand  skin  lesions,  and  psychiatric  disorders.  The  adverse  impacts  of  toxic  pollution  are \nparticularly severe on children. They play outside and are exposed to larger doses of toxins than \nadults. Smaller bodies, coupled with maturing biological systems, also accumulate higher doses \nper unit of mass, causing greater harm. Certain pollutants can permanently damage brain cells \nand nervous systems in young bodies. The longer these problems are left unaddressed, the \nmore  children  are  harmed.  Toxic  pollution  seriously  stunts  the  economic  prospects  of \ndeveloping countries.4 \n \n5.  Toxic wastes\u2014postconflict and industrial toxic wastes\u2014are present across Asia, but the \nscale of the problem is unknown. Some international nongovernment organizations (NGOs) are \n                                                 \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2008. 2007 Development Effectiveness Review.

New Delhi. \n ", "2   \nlobbying  Asian  governments  to  recognize  the  problem,  assess  its  importance,  and  take \nappropriate action. Some donors and development partners have indicated possible interest in \nsupporting cleaning of toxic wastes in the region. The first step, however, is to better assess the \nimportance of the problem. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will join the Global Inventory \nProject, a global effort to eliminate toxic wastes.5 The project is a joint effort supported by Green \nCross Switzerland; the European Commission through United Nations Industrial Development \nOrganization; and the Blacksmith Institute, an international NGO that partners with governments, \nNGOs, and community groups to identify and assess sites in more than 80 countries where \npollution poses the greatest threat to human health, especially that of women and children. The \nmain  objective  is  to  provide  data  to  governments,  international  organizations,  and  local \ncommunities that will enable them to prioritize clean-up activities and programs. The next step \nwill be to identify appropriate mechanisms, including funding sources, to help clean up the toxic \nsites.  \n \n6.  ADB will partner with an international NGO to build up local capacity in selected Asian \ncountries. Local teams will follow a short training program, then will identify toxic waste in their \nrespective  countries  and  assess  the  importance  of  the  problem.  In  parallel,  financing \nmechanisms will be explored\u2014in particular the possible establishment of a regional fund\u2014to \nhelp countries clean toxic waste legacy sites in the region. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  ADB\u2019s goal is to ensure that people in the region live in a clean environment with no \ntoxic  waste  in  the  proximity  of  human  settlements.  This  implies  that  governments  and \ndevelopment partners join forces with affected communities to clean up the existing toxic sites \nwith active pollution or legacy pollution where the polluter is no longer available, and sites with \nartisanal pollution where the polluters are too small to take responsibility for the cleanup. This \nrequires increased awareness and political commitment to put pressure on the polluters to \nreduce pollution and clean up their operations. \n \n8.  The TA will finance the first necessary steps to develop and implement an actionable \nstrategy to clean up toxic sites in the region. The outcomes will be better information and \nawareness among policymakers, development partners, and the general public of (i) the scope \nof the problem: human and environmental damage caused by legacy and artisanal pollution in \nAsia and the Pacific (inventory) and preliminary cost estimates of cleaning up operations; and \n(ii) possible approaches to deal with the problem, including funding mechanisms (feasibility \nstudy for a health and pollution fund). \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The  TA  will  provide  better  information  on  the  scope  of  the  problem.  Applying \nmethodologies developed by the Blacksmith Institute, the TA will develop a regional inventory of \npolluted sites in Asia and the Pacific, with an estimate of the populations affected at these sites. \nWhile the health risks are relatively well-known, the costs of cleaning up will be preliminary \nestimates based on ongoing clean-up activities of legacy and artisanal toxic sites around the \nworld. As the clean-up techniques evolve, cost estimates will be revised and adapted. \n                                                 \n5  The  Blacksmith  Institute.  2009.  The  Global  Inventory  Project.  http://www.blacksmithinstitute.org/blacksmith-\ninstitute-to-lead-global-inventory-of-polluted-sites.html  \n ", "      3\n \n10.  To provide governments and international partners with data that will enable them to \nunderstand the scope of the problem and prioritize interventions, the Blacksmith Institute trains \nand supports a team of investigators in the targeted countries to conduct initial site assessments \nof  polluted  sites.  Working  in  collaboration  with  local  and  national  authorities,  the  site \nassessment process reviews and collects as much information as possible from all stakeholders, \nincluding  local  NGOs,  businesses,  technical  agencies,  and  governments.  The  initial  site \nassessment protocol developed by Blacksmith involves a visit to the site and a review of key \ntechnical and historical information. Samples are taken, where credible tests are not already \navailable, and information collected related to the population and pollutant. \n \n11.  A major challenge is to leverage the funds necessary to remediate the many polluted \nplaces where health is at risk. The envisaged mechanism for dealing with the sites identified \nthrough the inventory  process is a health and pollution fund (HPF). In October 2007, the \nRockefeller Foundation and Blacksmith Institute organized a meeting in Bellagio, Italy, where \ndonor agencies, international organizations, and developing country representatives discussed \nthe problem. The meeting supported the idea of an HPF as a central trust fund to be mobilized \nwith contributions from bilateral and multilateral aid agencies and private institutions. The trust \nfund could be housed at an existing multilateral agency, at an approved commercial bank, or \nother mutually acceptable host. \n \n12.  In discussions following the Bellagio meeting, some interested donors raised the idea of \nregional HPFs. In this context, the TA will support a team of consultants to explore options on \nfunding framework, organizational structure, and operating principles for an HPF in Asia and the \nPacific. Their proposals will be presented and discussed with all stakeholders in a regional \nworkshop to be organized by the Blacksmith Institute in mid-2010. The workshop will be held in \nAsia, to be finalized in agreement with ADB. The objectives of this regional workshop will be to \nreach an agreement on the establishment of an HPF, including operating principles, and if \npossible start mobilizing resources for a regional HPF. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The Global Inventory Project started operations in February 2009 with funding from the \nEuropean Commission and Green Cross of Switzerland; they pledged about $1.2 million over  \n2 years on a grant basis to cover about 80 countries. ADB will join the Global Inventory Project \nthrough the TA and provide $900,000 on a grant basis from the Technical Assistance Special \nFund (TASF-IV) to cover and expand activities in Asia and the Pacific. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA, with the Poverty Reduction, Gender, and \nSocial  Development  Division  of  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department, \nresponsible for TA implementation and administration. \n \n15.  The TA will cover Asia and the Pacific. However, activities funded by the TA will only \ncommence in a particular developing member country after ADB receives a no-objection in \nwriting from the government of the concerned country. \n \n16.  The TA will begin in December 2009 and be completed by December 2010. It will be \nimplemented through the Blacksmith Institute, which will be engaged through single-source \nselection in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \n ", "4   \ntime to time). Single-source selection is justified because ADB is joining the Global Inventory \nProject implemented by the Blacksmith Institute. Blacksmith will use the services of international \nand national experts on an intermittent basis: 19 person-months of international experts and 140 \nperson-months of national experts. \n \n17.  The Blacksmith Institute6 is a nonprofit organization committed to mitigating the human \nhealth effects of industrial wastes, air emissions, and hazardous materials in the developing \nworld. The organization's strategy brings resources and expertise to local groups and agencies \nin  developing  economies  to  solve  pollution  problems.  Its  Technical  Advisory  Board,  which \ncomprises a dozen experts in public health and environment, provides technical and operating \noversight. The Blacksmith Institute is implementing the Global Identification and Evaluation of \nPollution Sites project, started in January 2009 and financed by Green Cross Switzerland \n($447,426) and the European Commission through the United Nations Industrial Development \nOrganization (\u20ac495,140). By recruiting the Blacksmith Institute, ADB and the region will benefit \nfrom global experience and information from other regions. Blacksmith\u2019s contract with Green \nCross  Switzerland  (signed  on  10  December  2008)  and  the  United  Nations  Industrial \nDevelopment Organization (funded by the European Commission, signed on 21 January 2009) \nstipulates progress payments based on quarterly reports. The payments have  been made \naccordingly, reflecting Blacksmith\u2019s capacity to manage the funds. \n \n18.  Disbursement  under  the  TA  will  follow  ADB's  technical  assistance  disbursement \nhandbook. 7 Advance  payment  procedures  to  the  consultant  for  training,  seminars,  and \nconferences will allow timely implementation of activities. Progress payment will be made on the \nbasis of quarterly reports. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $900,000 on a grant basis for \nImproving the Health Status of Vulnerable Communities Threatened by Legacy or Artisanal \nPollution, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n                                                 \n6  The Blacksmith Institute. http://www.blacksmithinstitute.org/ \n7 ADB. 2008.
