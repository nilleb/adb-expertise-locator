INTRODUCTION\n1. During the 2001 Country Programming Mission, the Government of India requested\ntechnical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to prepare the Madhya\nPradesh State Road Sector Development Project which is included in the 2002-2004 lending\nprogram for India. The TA Fact-Finding Mission visited India from 19 to 23 June 2001 and\nreached an understanding with the Government on the scope and other aspects of the TA.1\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. ADB has taken a focal state approach for its state-level interventions giving high\npriority to the sound management of public finance, a prerequisite for sustainable investment\ninterventions in a state. Gujarat was the first state selected as a focal state, and Madhya\nPradesh (MP) the second. An essential element of the focal state approach is sequencing of\ninterventions, starting from a public resource management program loan and moving to\nindividual sector loans, such as those in the power and road sectors. The proposed road\nsector development project forms part of this sequential approach.\n3. Statewide Enterprise Reform Efforts Under a Program Loan. With per capita\nincome at less than $200 per year, MP is among the poorest states in India. MP\u2019s industrial\nbase is still predominantly agricultural; manufacturing and service sectors lag behind.2 MP\u2019s\nweak revenue base has been a major problem. In 1999 the fiscal deficit reached 5.4 percent\nof the gross state domestic product.  To address this problem, ADB agreed to extend a $250\nmillion loan to MP in December 1999 to help implement a public resource management\nprogram; a major aspect was the restructuring of public sector undertakings. As part of its\nrestructuring efforts, the Madhya Pradesh government (MPG) has taken a series of actions\nincluding: (i) introducing a voluntary retirement scheme designed to minimize the economic\nimpact of downsizing or closure of public sector undertakings, and (ii) instituting social safety\nnet programs to help displaced staff and workers reenter the labor markets. The proposed\nrestructuring of the Public Works Department (PWD) is in line with the overall reform efforts\nfor public sector undertakings.\n4. Road Sector.  MP has 67,205 kilometers (km) of roads, consisting of 4,717 km of\nnational highways, 7,459 km of state highways, 31,660 km of major district roads, and\n255,033 km of rural roads.3 MP\u2019s road sector has long suffered from a chronic shortage of\nfunds. This has resulted in premature deterioration of the road network. Many parts of state\nroads and major district roads have deteriorated to the point of needing the existing roads to\nbe rebuilt from the subbase to the pavement (i.e., full rehabilitation).\n5. Faced with this situation, the MPG has decided to launch a rapid rehabilitation and\nupgrading program for state roads. From its entire network, MPG has chosen 14 corridors\ntotaling 1,961 km as \u201chigh density corridors.\u201d Rehabilitation of these will be carried out\nthrough a new arrangement with maximum participation of the private sector. The new\narrangement includes the following main features:\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)\n1  The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities in July 2001.\n2  Due to the lack of information, all data included in the document is based on those before bifurcation into two\nstates.\n3  Public Works Department. 2001. Policy on Road Development in Madhya Pradesh. Government of Madhya\nPradesh.", "2\n(i)  The State Bridge Construction Corporation (SBCC) was revived, after its\nclosure in 1993, as an implementing agency. Staffed with a small number of\nnewly assigned professional staff (approximately 20), SBCC will carry out its\nentire role by contracting out to the private sector.\n(ii)  Private sector entities will be competitively selected and award will be to the\none  with  the  lowest  grant  amount  from  the  MPG.  Concessionaires  will\nrehabilitate and operate roads for 15 years and then transfer them to MPG.\n(iii)  Necessary  funds  for  these  grants  will  be  mobilized  through  bonds  to  be\nissued by the Infrastructure Investment Fund Board, created in early 2001.\n6. This  scheme  has  functioned  well.  Being  operationalized  only  in  February  2001,\nSBCC has already selected rehabilitate, operate, and transfer concessionaires for the first\nseven corridors. The second group of concessionaires will be selected by the end of October\n2001 for four corridors.  The relative success of the public-private partnership scheme in MP\npoints to the importance of considering some critical elements to be taken into account for\nfuture MP reforms:\n(i)  If adequately funded and efficiently organized, a small-sized implementation\nagency can deliver substantial road construction works in a relatively short\nperiod of time in MP.\n(ii)  If appropriately designed and underpinned by a proper level of public sector\nsupport, the state road subsector could attract a significant level of private\nsector participation.\n(iii)  The MPG has adequate institutional capability to carry out complicated and\ninnovative reforms.\n7. Given this background, the TA Fact-Finding Mission and the MPG agreed to address\nan even more difficult task, i.e., PWD restructuring, in the TA and ensuing project.\n8. Need to Restructure PWD. The PWD system has existed for more than a century\nwithout being subjected to any major organizational changes. India introduced the PWD\nsystem in all states in the mid-1850s with similarly mandated functions. Delivering all road-\nrelated services (including design, construction, operation, and maintenance) by its own\ncadre of engineers and labor has been the PWD core function. It was an efficient system a\ncentury ago under the force account system, but not now when most of the road works are\ncontracted out to the private sector. Typical problems facing PWDs include underfunding,\noverstaffing, and delayed delivery of road rehabilitation and maintenance services. State\ngovernments  understand  the  problems,  but  they  have  taken  little  action  because  of\ndifficulties likely to be encountered in restructuring the PWDs. Successful PWD reform in\none state would have a significant demonstration effect for the others.\n9. While  the  various  PWDs  experience  similar  problems,  the  seriousness  of  the\nproblems differs from state to state. The situation in MP is among the most difficult in India,\nwith road conditions generally poorer than those in neighboring states. This is largely due to\nthe insufficient budgetary allocation for road maintenance. In 2000, MP spent Rs22,500 per\nkm, which is only one fourth of that of Andhra Pradesh. The number of employees of MP\u2019s\nPWD exceeds 50,000. Salaries and wages spent for the employees account for about 50\npercent of the budgetary allocation to PWD (2000/01 nonplan allocation to PWD).", "3\n10. Cognizant  of  these  problems,  PWD  has  decided  to  launch  an  institutional\ndevelopment study for MP to be completed by an international consulting firm.4 In July 2001,\nthe  consultant  developed  a  broad-based  strategy,  following  international  best  practices.\nHowever, the strategy did not adequately address a fundamental issue associated with state\nroad management, i.e., inefficiency and overstaffing of PWD.\n11. In June 2001, ADB\u2019s TA Fact-Finding Mission visited MP and discussed state road\nmanagement issues with the MPG. The Mission has reached an agreement with the MPG to\naddress the organizational issue in the TA and in the proposed Project. Essential elements\nto be considered in this restructuring exercise are as follows:\n(i)  Separation of regulatory and operational functions: The current PWD\ncovers both aspects under its responsibilities, but these two functions have to\nbe separated. A possible approach would be to transform the PWD into (i) a\nhighway authority to focus on regulations, policy formulation, and planning\naspects; and (ii) an implementing agency, similar to SBCC, that would be\nresponsible  for  delivering  road  upgrading  and  maintenance  programs  by\ncontracting out.\n(ii)  Empowerment of implementing agencies. Implementation agencies should\nbe given adequate funds and decision-making authority so that they can\ndeliver their services in an efficient manner. A road fund or other similarly\ndesigned funding mechanism will be established for this purpose.\n(iii)  Minimization  of  adverse  impact  of  PWD  restructuring.  The smooth\nimplementation of social safety net programs including a voluntary retirement\nscheme  is  critically  important  to  facilitate  the  transition  of  employees;\nadequate support must be provided to redundant PWD employees wishing to\nestablish construction and maintenance companies.\n12. Recently, PWD formulated a new road sector development policy,5 emphasizing the\nneed  to  (i)  upgrade  the  existing  road  networks;  (ii)  strengthen  road  maintenance  by\nestablishing  a  road  maintenance  fund  and  developing  a  computer-based  pavement\nmanagement system; (iii) enhance the level of technology for highway construction and\nmaintenance,  and  develop  human  resources  for  this;  and  (iv)  facilitate  private  sector\nparticipation in road rehabilitation and maintenance. The new policy highlights the need for\nradical changes in the existing system.\n13. With these new developments, the reform agenda can now be consolidated and an\nintegrated plan needs to be developed with a clear focus on the fundamental issues. The\naction should be followed later by a series of consultations with a broad range of key\nstakeholders  including  those  directly  affected  by  plan  implementation,  legislature,  road\nusers, construction industries, and relevant nongovernment organizations.\n14. Concept  for  the  MP  State  Road  Sector  Development  Project.  The  primary\nobjective of the ensuing Project will be to establish an institutional arrangement to deliver\nstate road development and maintenance services in an efficient and transparent manner.\nThis  will  require  development  and  implementation  of  a  series  of  plans  and  strategies.\nAnother and equally important project objective is to remove capacity bottlenecks of the\nexisting road networks. The MPG has identified several high priority corridors which would\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)\n4 The study was financed by the State Road Infrastructure Development Technical Assistance Project of the\nWorld Bank. This technical assistance project was approved by the World Bank in December 1996, and the\nInternational Development Association credit of $51.5 million was made available to all qualified states.\n5  PWD. 2001. Draft Policy on Road Development in Madhya Pradesh.", "4\nsignificantly enhance the overall efficiency of the state road network. The feasibility study\nhas  been  prepared  for  these  priority  corridors  under  the  State  Road  Infrastructure\nDevelopment Technical Assistance Project of the World Bank, and preliminary design is\ncurrently underway. The focus of ADB\u2019s assistance is thus to ensure that PWD\u2019s project\npreparation efforts meet ADB\u2019s requirements for project processing, particularly in the areas\nof social assessment, environment, resettlement, poverty impact assessment, economic and\nfinancial analyses, design standards, and procurement, and carry out supplemental studies if\nnecessary.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objective\n15. The main purpose of the TA is to help the MPG prepare a sector development\nprogram for reengineering6 the state road management system by developing necessary\nreform and implementation plans. The TA will also assist the MPG in preparing investment\ncomponents for state road rehabilitation and upgrading.\nB. Scope\n16. The TA will have four components.\n17. Component A. Develop, as part of the systemwide reform exercises under the\nprogrammatic approach for India\u2019s highway sector, an overall plan for policy and institutional\nreforms of the state road subsector in India.\n18. Component B. Develop for MP (i) an overall plan for reengineering the state road\nmanagement system, (ii) a transition plan for PWD from the existing organization to a\nreengineered  structure,  and  (iii)  a  social  marketing  strategy  identifying  major  target\naudiences or key stakeholders and developing public campaign strategies.\n19. Component C. Develop (i) an overall financing strategy for the development of\nstate roads, and (ii) a plan for establishing a road fund to develop and maintain state roads\nand major district roads of MP.\n20. Component D. Provide support to PWD of MP for preparing the ensuing project,\ncovering (i) environmental and social assessment, (ii) economic and financial analysis, and\n(iii) preliminary engineering design and procurement support.  Prepare the logical framework\nfor that project.\nC. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n21. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $800,000 equivalent, consisting of $545,946\nin  foreign  exchange  and  $254,054  equivalent  in  local  currency  cost.  ADB  will  finance\n$600,000 equivalent from the ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund covering the full\nforeign  exchange  cost  and  $54,054  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The  MPG  will  finance\n$200,000 equivalent by providing office accommodation, support facilities, counterpart staff,\nvehicles, and other logistical support. The detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 1.\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)\n6  The term \u201creengineering\u201d indicates a fundamental change in the current way of doing business, in this case,\ndelivering road development and maintenance services to users. It is aimed at creating a result-oriented\norganization by revamping the processes.", "5\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n22.  PWD will be the Executing Agency and will establish a project preparation unit\nheaded by a chief engineer consisting of several full-time and part-time professional staff. A\nhigh-level steering committee will provide overall guidance to the unit, and comprise the\nminister (PWD) as chair, and representatives of the Finance Department, Law Department,\nPWD, SBCC, Infrastructure Investment Fund Board, chambers of commerce, road transport\nindustries, and nongovernment organizations representing the interest of road users.\n23. The TA consultants will be recruited by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the\nUse of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of\ndomestic consultants. Specific methods of engaging consultants will differ from component\nto component. For component A, individual consultants will be engaged. For components B,\nC and D, consulting firms will be engaged in accordance with simplified technical proposal\nselection procedures.\n24. Terms of reference for the consultants are outlined in Appendix 2.(cid:1)The consultants,\nboth individual and a firm, are expected to commence their services in December 2001 and\nfinish by August 2002.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION\n25. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance to the Government of India in an amount not exceeding the\nequivalent of $600,000 for the purpose of preparing the Madhya Pradesh State Road Sector\nDevelopment Project, and hereby reports such action to the Board. The technical assistance\nwill be financed initially as a grant, but will be subject to the reimbursement arrangements\nset forth in the Board papers on Technical Assistance Operations (Doc. R51-77, dated 20\nMay 1977) and Streamlining of Technical Assistance Operations (Doc. R44-88, dated 21\nMarch 1988), including the provision that, in the event of the technical assistance resulting in\na loan from ADB, ADB may charge against such loan, and recover from it, the portion of the\ninitial grant that exceeds $250,000 equivalent.", "6\nAppendix 1\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\n($)\nForeign Local Total\nItem Exchange Currency Cost\nA.
