The Southwest Area Integrated Water Resources Planning and Management Project\n(SAIWRPMP), implemented by the Government of Bangladesh (the government) and supported\nby the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Government of Netherlands, sought to enhance\nthe livelihood of the rural population by improving the productivity and sustainability of existing\nunderperforming  flood  control  and  drainage/irrigation  (FCD/I)  schemes through  holistic  and\nparticipatory planning, development, and management of water, and delivery of support services\nto address locally identified constraints on agriculture, fisheries, and livelihood development.1 The\nsuccess of SAIWRPMP encouraged the government to expand and replicate the interventions in\nnew project areas using additional financing of $45.0 million under SAIWRPMP Phase II (ongoing\nproject) and $71.0 million under Phase III (ensuing project), using concessional ordinary capital\nresources loan.2 Phase III will cover Tungipara and Kotalipara Upazilas of Gopalganj district, with\nan estimated $71.0 million ADB financing component, to (i) strengthen climate change- and\ndisaster- resilience of existing FCD/I schemes in Phase III areas; (ii) support capacity building of\nbeneficiaries and relevant stakeholders in operations and maintenance (O&M) of assets under\nthe ongoing and ensuing projects, increase productivity of agriculture and fisheries, livelihood\ndevelopment; and (iii) increase awareness of climate change impacts and management. The\nproject  will  have  a  strong  focus  on  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups  and  women  through\ncomprehensive study of the changing rural economic landscape in the country and targeted\nlivelihood interventions.\nA. Justification\n2. The  proposed  transaction  technical  assistance (TA)  will  support  the  government  in\n(i) project  preparatory  activities  for  the  ensuing  project,  and  (ii) additional  capacity  building\nactivities under the ongoing project. The TA will address some of the diverse, complex, and\ninterlinked  institutional  challenges  by  strengthening  the  sustainability  of  capacity  building\ninterventions under ongoing and ensuing projects as well as support project preparatory activities\nof ensuing project. Climate change- and disaster- resilience will be the key underlying principle\nfor all TA outputs. A One ADB approach will be adopted in framing and developing the rural\nlivelihoods study. Cohesiveness and strategic alignment of the TA scope will be ensured through\nconsultations with relevant sector divisions within ADB and with external stakeholders. As the\nloan funds under the ongoing project have already been allocated for planned interventions, TA\nfunds are being requested. The TA is included in the Bangladesh Indicative Country Pipeline and\nMonitoring  Report,  2022\u20132024.3 The  TA  is  aligned  with  ADB  Strategy  2030\u2019s  operational\npriorities.4\n3. Country context. No other highly populated country illustrates the centrality of water and\nthe  critical  need  for  managing  climate  change  impacts  towards  achieving  inclusive  and\nsustainable growth as Bangladesh has demonstrated in the past decade. The country is one of\nthe fastest growing economies in the world clocking an average 7.0% during financial year (FY)\n1  ADB. 2005.

The operational priorities (OPs) that the TA will support are (i) OP1: addressing remaining poverty and \nreducing inequalities; (ii) OP2: accelerating progress in gender equality; (iii) OP3: tackling climate change, building \nclimate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability; (iv) OP5: promoting rural development \nand food security; and (v) OP6: strengthening governance and institutional capacity. ", "2 \n2009\u20122019, with per capita income rising from $754 to $2,064, and poverty incidence falling from \n35.0% to 20.5% and extreme poverty rate from 18.0% to 10.5%, graduating from low-income \ncountry to a lower middle-income country in 2015.5 Economic structures have been transformed \nwith steadily decreasing share of agriculture in national gross domestic product (GDP) and in rural \neconomy and narrowing the urban-rural divide. What makes this change truly remarkable is that \nthis achievement came amidst the backdrop of being the seventh most vulnerable country in the \nworld to climate change risk incurring 0.4% GDP losses during 1999\u20122018,6 as well as ranking \namong the top five nations most at risk from natural hazards, particularly to cyclones and floods.7 \nThis has been possible largely due to a combination of inclusive development policies and \nfocused attention to managing climate change- and disaster- risks. Bangladesh has undertaken \na progressively comprehensive approach to management of water as an economic resource and \nbuilding risk resilience as an integral solution to inclusive economic growth.  \n4. Water  resource  management  in  ensuing  project  areas.  The  Ministry  of  Water\nResources (MOWR) is the apex water resource management body directing water-related policy\nand strategy in the country, while the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) is its\nprincipal agency. BWDB is notable for technical capacities in planning and development of water-\nrelated infrastructure. However, further capacity augmentation of BWDB in decentralized water\nmanagement  and  integrated  planning  that  is  flexible  and  adaptable  to  future  development\npathways is needed. This is particularly relevant for the low-lying areas of Tungipara and\nKotalipara Upazilas where flooding and drainage congestion affects 23,169 hectares of cultivable\narea. These regions are fraught with complex interlinked hydrological, hydraulic, environmental,\nsocial, and economic challenges that are addressed by the ensuing project through climate\nresilient FCD/I strengthening interventions, including river dredging, re-sectioning of embankment,\nrehabilitation of existing regulators and gates, re-excavation of khals, protective works, and\nconstruction of other structures and training centers for water management groups (WMGs) and\nwater management organizations (WMOs). The ensuing project will place special focus on the\nsustainability of the FCD/I interventions to negate similar issues observed under the ongoing\nproject due to the acute staffing shortage at the Office of Chief Water Management that affected\nWMO trainings in mobilizing and effective use of O&M funds and delayed WMO activities.\n5. The  ensuing  project  also  recognizes  that  structural  transformations  of  the  hitherto\npredominantly agricultural rural economic landscapes could intrinsically benefit the skilled and\neducated  to  capitalize  on  emerging  economic  opportunities  and  marginalize  the  poor  and\nvulnerable groups and women from the development narrative.8 Considering the high poverty and\nlow adult literacy levels (59.5%)9 and disparities (0.16\u20120.19 Gini coefficient in 2010)10 prevalent\nin project areas and the projected additional unemployment due to environmental vulnerabilities,11\n5  General Economics Division, Planning Commission, Government of the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh. 2020. \nEighth Five Year Plan (July 2020\u2012June 2025): Promoting Prosperity and Fostering Inclusiveness.

", "3 \na comprehensive study to map the nature and extent of causalities and determinants of the impact \non livelihoods and develop the strategies to improve rural household incomes and strengthen \ntheir economic resilience is necessary. \nB. Outputs and Activities\n6. Output 1: Technical design prepared, and due diligence completed for ensuing\nproject. The Bangladesh Delta Plan (BDP) 2100 identifies flooding, drainage congestion, water\nlogging, arsenic contamination of groundwater, and water deficits in dry season as the principal\nchallenges  affecting  areas  of  ensuing  project  (footnote  10).  The  ensuing  project  proposes\nstrengthening of FCD/I schemes for climate change- and disasters- risks that can protect about\n70% of the land while the rest are utilized for culture fishery. Considering that management of\nwater-related risk is identified as fundamental for economic growth and resilience, the TA will\nsupport BWDB in formulation of ensuing project, including strengthening measures for climate\nchange- and disaster- resilience of existing FCD/I schemes, due diligence for all technical,\neconomic, financial, procurement, gender, environmental and social safeguards aspects, and\nclimate  risk  vulnerability  assessments.12 The  TA  will  also  support  preparation  of  terms  of\nreference for consultancy packages to be procured under the ensuing project.\n7. Output 2: Rural Livelihoods Action Plan developed. Interventions under the ADB\u2019s\nongoing and ensuing projects (footnotes 1 and 2) will significantly impact livelihood patterns as\nflood protection works will increase cropping intensity, but also cause a net reduction in capture\nfishing productivity that will necessitate livelihood shift towards culture fishing and intensification\nof  agricultural  patterns,  both  of  which  require  knowledge  of  and  skills  to  adopt  modern\ntechnologies as well as access to support systems during the shift.13 In parallel, the ongoing\neconomic diversification and the proposed plans by the government to provide basic services\ncomparable to urban areas (under government\u2019s Amor Gaon Amor Shahar national flagship\nprogram)  will  significantly  alter  and  redistribute  livelihood  patterns  and  enhance  economic\ndevelopment.14 The TA will support a comprehensive analysis of the current socioeconomic\nstructures and livelihood patterns in the project areas, identify opportunities posed by emerging\nsectors, and suggest climate resilient livelihoods and specific actionable measures for addressing\nskills and capacity gaps among different socio-cultural and economic groups, particularly the poor\nand vulnerable groups and women, to ensure contextually appropriate, inclusive, sustainable,\nresilient, and vibrant development pathways and diverse rural livelihoods.\n8. Output 3: Capacity of Water Management Organizations and beneficiary groups\nstrengthened. The effectiveness of the FCD/I schemes depends on sustainability of O&M by the\nWMGs and WMOs. Therefore, besides extending support in establishing WMOs and WMGs and\ntheir  trainings  in  O&M,  the  TA  will  support  formulation  of  a resource  plan  for  sustainable\noperations  of the WMOs  under  ongoing and  ensuing  projects,  including  financing  options,\ninstruments and strategies to directly accrue contributions from BWDB and other government\n12 Indicative safeguard categorization for the TA is \u201cB\u201d for environment, \u201cB\u201d for involuntary resettlement and \u201cC\u201d for \nIndigenous Peoples as per ADB Safeguard Policy, 2009.  \n13 The Feasibility Study Reports for the subprojects of (i) Tarail-Pachuria, (ii) Ramshil-Kafulabari, and (iii) Rajoir-\nKotalipara, submitted by BWDB to ADB in February 2020, state that the project interventions will have an impact on \ncapture fisheries due to the elimination of annual floods and drainage congestion though productivity of capture \nfisheries is expected to increase leading to overall increase in fisheries productivity. Post-project productivity of \nculture fisheries is expected to decrease by 28.86 metric tons but will be compensated by the expected 8,141.70 \nmetric tons productivity from culture fisheries. \n14 My Village-My Town project is implemented by  Local Government Engineering Department Government of \nBangladesh, and aims to provide modern civic amenities and basic facilities in every village, including income-\ngenerating opportunities, infrastructural development, electricity, quality health services and education.  ", "4 \nsources to WMOs during the transition period, and for efficient and full cost recovery of O&M of \nwater-related assets in the longer term. The TA will support the Office of Chief Water Management \nin training WMOs to function as envisaged under the Participatory Water Management Rules, \n2014 (PWMR 2014). Implementation of select activities from the Rural Livelihood Action Plan will \nbe an important component supported under the TA, which will include use and establishment of \nextension centers for agriculture and soil development, pisciculture, feedstock, value added \nproducts, etc. Institutional collaboration and financing strategies for these extension centers will \nalso be developed using TA support. Livelihood generation activities and training programs will \nspecifically target the poor and vulnerable groups and women, considering the local contexts and \navailable capacities.15  \n9. Value addition. Considering the criticality of effective O&M for long term sustainability of\nFCD/I schemes developed under the project and other government schemes, the TA will support\nthe development of a resource plan for sustainable operations of WMOs and WMGs, as well as\nthe agriculture and fisheries interventions that will be established in collaboration with the line\ndepartments. The TA will also attempt to understand the implications of the current and future\ndevelopment trajectories in the project areas and impact on rural economies and help map the\ndifferent  causative  factors  and  quantify  dependencies.  The  livelihood  study  will  contribute\nsignificantly in generating critical evidence to support design and planning of climate resilient\ndevelopment pathways, and devise localized strategies for formulating inclusive and sustainable\nrural livelihoods. The study will also assist in evidence-based policy-making for adaptation\nmeasures, particularly water-related interventions, within the regional socioeconomic context.\nC. Cost and Financing\n10. The TA is estimated to cost $1,100,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant\nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 7). The key expenditures items are\nlisted in Appendix 1. The government will provide in-kind support in the form of data, staff time,\nand meeting and event venues; review of recommendations and tools provided by the consultants;\nand participation in trainings, workshops, and knowledge sessions. The government was informed\nthat approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. Entire TA funds is\nconsidered climate adaptation as (i) FCD/I strengthening proposed under Output 1, (ii) rural\nlivelihood study under Output 2 that will explore and suggest climate resilient livelihoods, and\n(iii) trainings and capacity building under Output 3 for O&M of flood protection infrastructure,\nindicate climate change adaptation as fundamental objective and principle for all TA activities.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n11. ADB will administer the TA, in consultation with the executing and implementing agencies.\nADB\u2019s South Asia Department will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants, and undertake\nprocurement of consulting services. The executing agency will provide overall direction, oversight,\npolicy advice, and necessary coordination among various agencies to avoid duplication and\nensure effective and timely delivery of outputs of the TA. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19)\npandemic is not expected to have any major impact on the TA implementation and a buffer has\nbeen incorporated in the cost estimates and implementation period to mitigate cost increases and\nimplementation delays due to COVID-19 pandemic. The TA will adopt appropriate occupational\nhealth and safety measures to safely engage with stakeholders during implementation period.\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in the table.\n15 The DMF of the ongoing project was updated to reflect the outputs and activities of the transaction TA. The updated \nversion is in the project administration manual.
