The Third Primary Education Development Project (PEDP3) is currently planned to close \non 31 December 2017 with the Supporting Fourth Primary Education Development Program \n(PEDP4) scheduled to start from 1 January 2018. Analysis that will be undertaken as part of the \nclosure of the PEDP3 must be integrated into the design of PEDP4 in a timely and effective \nmanner. Given the scope and scale of the program, it is vital that the program preparatory \ntechnical assistance (TA) support be engaged to ensure this analysis can be duly assimilated \ninto PEDP4\u2019s design.  \n \n2.  During the joint preparation of the design, a division of labor for the design of the \nprogram  was  established.  The  existing  joint  working  group  structure  set  up  to  support \nimplementation  of  PEDP3  was  fine-tuned  to  support  the  preparation  of  PEDP4.  The  joint \nworking groups will discuss the elements of the program under their mandate. Based on the \nprogram concept, over 20 focus areas were identified. For each focus area, a focal point to \nsupport development of this part of the program was assigned. An international team leader and \ndeputy team leader are already engaged by another development partner. For about half of the \nfocus areas support from the program preparatory TA was requested. It was agreed that all \nfocal points will report to the already engaged team leader and deputy team leaders.  \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n \n3.  The planning for PEDP4 will require a TA project to be engaged to ensure the program \nidentifies  appropriate  focus  areas  for  interventions  and  that  relevant  due  diligence  is \nundertaken. This TA project will support and collaborate with the TA and other preparation \nsupport provided by the development partners interested in PEDP4.  \n \n4.  The major outputs and activities are summarized in Table A3.1.  \n \nTable A3.1: Summary of Major Outputs and Activities \nExpected  Expected \nCompletion  Completion \nMajor Activities  Date  Major Outputs  Date \nIdentify activities for the PEDP4 to  30 Mar 2017  DN focused on institutionalization of  30 Mar 2017 \ninstitutionalize academic testing and  academic testing to inform PEDP4 \nimprove the use of subsequent data to  planning \ninform policy \nIdentify activities for PEDP4 to explore  31 May 2016  DN focused on exploration of  31 May 2016 \ninnovative modalities to enable more  equitable financing modalities to \nequitable education financing  inform PEDP4 planning \nIdentify scope of activities for PEDP4 to  31 May 2017  DN focused on strengthening IT  31 May 2017 \ndevelop IT system architecture that can  systems architecture to inform PEDP4 \nstrengthen data systems for decision  planning, including a time-bound \nmaking  action plan \nIdentify scope for PEDP4 to support  31 May 2017  Report including PEDP4 scope of  31 May 2017 \nfurther decentralization to the field level  decentralization, an action plan, and \na DN to inform PEDP4 planning \nUsing the national PPP framework as a  30 Apr 2017  A PPP framework adapted for use in  30 Apr 2017 \nbase, develop a framework for the  the primary education sub-sector and \nspecifics of primary education  a DN to inform PEDP4 planning \nReview preliminary costings by subject  31 May 2017  Document program costings including  31 May 2017 \nmethods of calculation \nspecialists for accuracy \nDevelop a program M&E matrix  30 Jun 2017  PEDP4 M&E matrix  30 Jun 2017 \n ", "Appendix 3  11 \n \n \n \nExpected  Expected \nCompletion  Completion \nMajor Activities  Date  Major Outputs  Date \nReview social and environmental  30 Apr 2017  Reports outline of the findings of their  30 Apr 2017 \nframeworks  due diligence assessment \nProgram implementation quality assurance  30 Jun 2017  Report on the appraisal mission  30 Jun 2017 \nassessment  highlighting PEDP4 design areas \nrequiring further strengthening \nIdentify and document the needs-based  30 Apr 2017  A DN to inform PEDP4 planning and  30 Apr 2017 \ninfrastructure (including water, sanitation,    any other additional documents \nand hygiene infrastructure) requirements  required to finalize the PEDP4 \nof PEDP4  program document \nDN = design note, IT = information technology, M&E = monitoring and evaluation, PEDP4 = Fourth Primary Education \nDevelopment Program, PPP = public\u2013private partnership.  \nSource: Post-PEDP3 Planning Identification Mission Aide Memoire, June 2016. \n \nC.
