The Government of Indonesia has requested project preparatory technical assistance \n(TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to prepare a project for Sustainable Aquaculture \nDevelopment for Food Security and Poverty Reduction. The TA Fact-Finding Mission visited \nIndonesia in March 2003 and discussed the project concept with representatives of Government \nagencies, regional governments and rural communities. The Mission  reached understanding \nwith the Government on the objectives, scope, implementation arrangements, cost estimates, \nand consultants\u2019 terms of reference  for the TA. The TA  is included in ADB\u2019s 2003 country \nassistance program for Indonesia.1  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Aquaculture contributes significantly to food availability, household food security, income \ngeneration, trade, and improved living standards in many developing countries in Asia. In poor \nrural communities, aquaculture can be an integral component of development contributing to \nsustainable livelihoods and enhancing social well-being. Since 1990 the gap between the \ndemand for and supply of food fish has been widening rapidly due to the decline of capture \nfisheries production and a continually growing population. Aquaculture is forecast to dominate, if \nnot surpass, the importance of marine capture fisheries in providing high-quality animal protein \nto lower income groups, employment, and export earnings.  \n3.   Indonesia harbors good fisheries and aquaculture potential. Because of its rich coastal \nresources and numerous inland water bodies suitable for aquaculture development, it is one \ncountry where aquaculture can contribute to economic and social development goals. The \npotential area for aquaculture is estimated at about 26 million hectares (ha) comprising 24.5 \nmillion ha of coastal waters suitable for mariculture; 1.1 million ha of rivers, lakes, ponds, and \npaddy fields; and 913,000 ha of brackish-water ponds. Actual area coverage of aquaculture is \ncurrently estimated at only 681,000 ha, less than 3% of the total potential area.  \n4.  Despite  declining  catches  from  capture  fisheries,  aquaculture  has  contributed \nsignificantly to the Indonesian economy in terms of fisheries production, employment, income \ngeneration, and exports. Aquaculture provides the required animal protein and other nutrients to \nthe poorer segments of the community.  Total aquaculture production in 2002 reached 1.14 \nmillion tons: half of that came from brackish-water ponds, and contributed 19% of total fishery \nproduction. Together with capture fisheries production, the gross value of output was estimated \nto reach $5 billion in 2000, or about 5% of the output of the agriculture sector and 2% of the total \neconomy.  The  fishery  sector  also  provides  two  thirds  of  the  supply  of  animal  protein  in \nIndonesia. There are an estimated 2 million fish farmers in the country, half of them fish on \nsmall scale and are in freshwater pond systems. The value of exports grew remarkably during \nthe 1980s at about 14% per year, mainly due to prawns. In 1997-2001, prawn exports averaged \n$800 million, contributing to half the value of the total for all fishery products.  \n 5.  Three main types of aquaculture are practiced in Indonesia: freshwater, brackish-water, \nand mariculture. The farmed species in freshwater systems are carp, tilapia, and gouramy. \nBrackish-water  culture  has  mainly  milkfish  and  prawns.  Mariculture  operations  using  rafts, \ncages,  and  pens  involve  species  such  as  grouper,  sea  perch  or  barramundi,  rabbit  fish, \nseaweeds, and pearl oysters. Most of the aquaculture systems are extensive to semi-intensive, \nrelying mostly on the natural elements for supply of seed, tidal exchange, and natural feeds.   \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in February 2003. ", "2 \n6.  Growth  in  aquaculture  was  not  sustained  because  of  several  problems,  notably \nenvironmental degradation; low growth and productivity due to poor management; lack of good \nquality seeds, credit facilities for poor fish farmers, and post-production facilities and marketing \ninfrastructure; conflict in water use in open water areas among fishers, fish farmers, and other \nusers; and, lastly, lack of social preparation for community participation and inefficient extension \nservice.  The  financial  crisis  further  aggravated  the  accessibility  of  credit  and  effectively \nincreased the prices of imported inputs such as feeds and chemicals.  \n7.  In 2002, poverty incidence in Indonesia was about 18% of the total population. The \nprovinces of North and South Sumatra, West Java, West Nusa Tenggara, Lampung, and \nSoutheast Sulawesi, the indicative sites for the proposed TA study, account for 33% of the rural \npoor.  Agriculture  employs  45%  of  the  total  labor  force  and  70%  of  the  poor.2 Within the \nagriculture, workers in fisheries are considered among the most poor. \n8.  Aquaculture has been identified as an important alternative livelihood for the poor rural \ncommunities.  In  the  last  5  years,  the  Government  has  given  emphasis  to  fisheries  and \naquaculture development and poverty reduction  through  a  number  of  measures. First, the \nMinistry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) was created in 2000 to better organize the \nGovernment\u2019s fisheries interventions. Second, the Directorate General of Aquaculture (DGA) is \nimplementing a Strategic Plan for Aquaculture Development  and Poverty Reduction (2000-\n2005) and a 5-point strategy (2001-2004) that focuses on aquaculture intensification, rural \naquaculture development, integrated aquaculture systems, culture-based fisheries, and eco-\nfriendly aquaculture development.  \n9.  To realize the goals of rural development, food security, and poverty reduction, and \nconsidering the limited capacity of the private sector for policy reform, technology transfer, and \nenvironmental  management  for  aquaculture,  the  Government  will  play  a  catalytic  role  in \naquaculture development; it proposes to develop effective policies for better water management \nand financial provision for smallholders, and harness the vast human resources, especially at \nthe community level, through social preparation, community organization, and localized training \non better culture technologies and  management practices such as  good farming systems, \ndisease  control  and  water  management,  sourcing  of  quality  seeds  and  other  inputs,  and \nimprovement of market and information channels.  \n10.  Since 1982, ADB has financed seven projects for aquaculture development in Indonesia. \nFour projects, 3 implemented before 1997, focused mainly on the development of shrimp culture \nin brackish-water to contribute to exports. Four ongoing projects,4 mainly for coastal resource \nmanagement and conservation, include  aquaculture development  as a strategy and support \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2000.

", "    3 \nactivity to supplement declining catches from marine fisheries and improve the poverty and food \nsecurity situation in target coastal communities. These projects covered very limited coastal \nareas. Before 1997, ADB\u2019s past exposure in the aquaculture sector, including projects with \nexplicit bias for smallholders, did not sufficiently contribute to poverty reduction due to the \ndifficulties in technology adaptation, lack of access to land and water resources, ineligibility for \ninstitutional credit, and aversion to risks. Lessons learned highlight the need for the  TA an \nappropriate policy environment and a rigorous assessment of the capacities of executing and \nparticipating agencies to deliver support services to the beneficiaries.  \n11.  The  proposed  project  will  facilitate  the  achievement  of  the  Millennium  Development \nGoals adopted by ADB as well as the government, particularly those related to eradication of \nextreme poverty and hunger, and environmental sustainability. The Project is in line with ADB's \noverarching goal of poverty reduction and the Country Strategy and Program (CSP 2003-2005), \nwhich  give  greater  emphasis  to  reducing  poverty  and  regional  inequalities,  ensuring  food \nsecurity, and promoting environmental management and sustainable use of natural resources. \nADB\u2019s fisheries policy also supports sustainable aquaculture development, and research and \ndevelopment and dissemination of environment-friendly aquaculture technologies for increased \nproduction. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n12.  The Project aims to contribute to the poverty reduction and food security goals of the \nGovernment, and protect the environment in inland and coastal water areas. The TA will help \nthe  Government  prepare  an  investment  project  for  the  sustainable  development  and \nmanagement of aquaculture through (i) increased fish production and products; (ii) improved \nemployment, income, and nutrition of poor fish farmers and coastal communities; and  (iii) \nadaptation of environmental sustainable technologies. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA will assess the status of aquaculture development in the country, identify major \nproblems, opportunities and strategies to achieve sustainable growth and reduce poverty. The \nTA will use the participatory and consultative approach as a basic strategy and techniques such \nas surveys, questionnaires, and focus group discussions to collect baseline data and develop \nprotocols for monitoring and evaluation. A participatory livelihood assessment will be carried out \nto determine the activities of men, women, and the poor to enable participation and ensure more \nfocused targeting of benefits. Consistent with lessons learned from past projects, the TA will \nexamine all risks faced by potential beneficiaries, design an innovative credit scheme, and \nensure compliance with environmental assessments and safeguards.  \n \n14.  The TA will formulate an investment project, which is envisaged to have the following \ncomponents: (i) empowerment of fisherfolk communities; (ii) rehabilitation and improvement of \nmanagement  systems  for  traditionally  cultured  freshwater  species  such  as  carp,  tilapia, \ngouramy, and catfish; and development of technologies for other high-value species such as \neels and turtles; (iii) rehabilitation and improvement of management systems for traditionally \ncultured brackish-water and marine species\u2014groupers, seabass, prawns, milkfish, aquarium \nfish, seaweeds, and shellfish\u2014and development of technologies for new species such as sea \nhorses, wrasses, etc.; and (iv) institutional strengthening and development support services. ", "4 \nBrackish-water  aquaculture  activities  will  involve  mainly  rehabilitating  and  enhancing  the \nproductivity of existing aquaculture facilities. It will not open up new areas through mangrove \nconversion. \n  \n15.  The TA will conduct  a study  to assess the policy framework for national aquaculture \ndevelopment and compliance with international protocols on sustainable aquaculture, address \ninstitutional credit and  property rights issues, review legislation vis-\u00e0-vis development of a \nregulatory framework for local governments, and identify specific pro-poor policy and strategy \nfor aquaculture development. The TA will also conduct institutional studies to assess the roles, \nresponsibilities,  and  capacities  of  national  and  local  government  agencies,  research \norganizations, extension agencies, and private  institutions/sector in aquaculture development \nand management, and develop an institutional strengthening program to support sustainable \naquaculture development and management for poverty reduction.   \n \n16.  The  TA  will  introduce  gender  sensitive  technical  guidelines  and  methods  for  each \nfeasible  aquaculture  activity  for  demonstration  and  replication  by  community-based \norganizations, the private sector, and, most importantly, the poor segments of the community. \nThe output will be a range of options from which communities including the poor can select  the \nsystem  that  meets  their  needs  and    fits  the  opportunities  and  constraints  of  the  local \nenvironment.  The  TA  will  assess  environmental  conditions  for  the  proposed  aquaculture \ndevelopment activities and project areas, identify any positive and  negative environmental \nimpacts of the investment project, and recommend measures to mitigate negative impacts and \nprotect the environment. \n \n17.  The TA will conduct a marketing study (international and domestic markets), which will \ninclude recommendations for the DGA, including the provincial and regency marine affairs and \nfisheries offices (Dinas), on sourcing, handling, and disseminating critical market information. \nThe TA will estimate costs and benefits for the proposed project components, conduct economic \nvaluation of  the environmental impacts of the proposed rehabilitation and management of \nexisting aquaculture systems, analyze the project risks, and prepare a cost recovery scheme for \ninfrastructure-related  activities.  The  financing  arrangement  should  be  consistent  with  the \nGovernment  Regulation  No.  107/2000,  and  in  accordance  with  the  policy  on  regional \ndevelopment and decentralization. \n \n18.  The TA will conduct comprehensive poverty impact assessment. The TA will conduct \nparticipatory rapid appraisals (PRAs), poverty analysis, and socioeconomic assessment in 7\u20138 \nidentified sites. The TA will organize and conduct three stakeholder workshops to discuss and \nagree on the project concept, design, and implementation arrangements. The TA will involve \npotential beneficiaries and stakeholders in preparing the investment project and will identify \nspecific strategies, approaches, and options  aimed at poverty  reduction and  environmental \nprotection. Sites for the feasibility study will be selected using the following parameters:  (i) \nhigher poverty, (ii) potential for aquaculture development and urgent needs for improvement of \nexisting systems to increase productivity and protect the environment; and (iii) local government, \nprivate sector and rural communities\u2019 initiatives and commitment to improve socioeconomic \nconditions. Indicative areas for the study are North and South Sumatra, Lampung, West Java, \nWest Nusa Tenggara, and Southeast Sulawesi, which are within ADB\u2019s geographic focus for \ninvestment and poverty reduction. \n ", "    5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.12 million equivalent, comprising $570,000 in \nforeign exchange and $550,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government of the United \nKingdom will finance $800,000 equivalent covering the entire foreign exchange cost of $570,000 \nand $230,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The Government will contribute the balance \nof the local currency cost of $320,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed as a grant from the \nDepartment for International Development (DFID). The Government has been advised that \napproval of the TA does not commit ADB to financing any ensuing project. Cost estimates and \nfinancing are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  DGA will be the Executing Agency for the TA. Interagency coordination will be ensured \nby a TA steering committee, to be chaired by the secretary of DGA. The committee will meet \nperiodically to review TA progress and provide guidance and feedback to the consultants. The \ncommittee  will  include  representatives  of  government  agencies  such  as  the  National \nDevelopment Planning Agency (BAPPENAS), Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Forestry,  DGA \nand relevant directorate generals in MMAF, as well as NGOs and the private sector. \n \n21.  The TA will be implemented over 7 months, with completion expected by March 2004. \nThe services of a team of international and domestic consultants totaling 51 person-months will \nbe recruited through a firm. The international consultants (20 person-months) will have expertise \nin policy and institutional development,  aquaculture development (mariculture and brackish-\nwater),  aquaculture  environment,  marketing,  and  economic  and  financial  analyses.  The \ndomestic consultants (31 person-months) will have expertise in policy and institutional analysis, \nfreshwater aquaculture, fisheries research and development, environmental impact assessment, \ncommunity and gender development, and information management and training. ADB will \nrecruit the consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants using the \nquality-and-cost-based  method,  based  on  a  simplified  technical  proposal  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The terms of reference for \nthe consultants and required reports are given in Appendix 3. Equipment will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n22.  The Government will provide counterpart staff to work with the team of consultants, and \nadequate office space. The counterpart staff will be drawn from MMAF, DGA, and relevant \nprovincial and district fisheries offices, and will work closely with the team of consultants to \nformulate  and  evaluate  strategies  and  project  components  and  identify  suitable  project \ninterventions. Active involvement of the stakeholders in designing the proposed project will be \nsought throughout the course of the TA, through workshops and focus group discussions. A \nsummary initial poverty and social analysis is given in Appendix 4. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n23.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national   Sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?      Yes  Priority in country poverty                    Yes \nPartnership agreement? \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Indonesia: \nThirty-six million people are estimated to be living below the poverty line in Indonesia, 75% of \nthem live in the rural areas (2000). The provinces of North and South Sumatra, West Java, Lampung, \nWest Nusa Tenggara and Southeast Sulawesi, which the Government of Indonesia has identified for \naquaculture development, comprise roughly 33% of the 27 million rural poor. Most of these poor people \nare  farm  workers  dependent  on  agriculture.  Aquaculture  can  supplement  farm  income,  provide \nadditional nutrition, or be a major livelihood source of rural folks. The long-term goal of the Project will \nbe to reduce poverty while making a significant contribution to strengthening national and regional food \nsecurity. The TA will  assist the Government  to  prepare an investment project for the sustainable \ndevelopment and management of aquaculture with the objectives of (i) increasing fish production and \nproducts; (ii) improving the income, nutritional, and employment status of poor fish farmers and coastal \ncommunities; and (iii) protecting the environment in inland and coastal water areas. \n \nB.   Poverty Analysis        Proposed Classification: Core Poverty \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n  The  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA) will assess the types of aquaculture \nactivities that are accessible and economically and technically feasible for widespread adaptation by \npoor segments of the community. The PPTA will also ensure that the project framework allows for \ninterventions  and  mechanisms  to  monitor  improvement  of  human  development  including  income, \nnutrition, and general social well-being. \n  Poverty analysis will be undertaken to estimate the expected impact of project interventions on \npoor communities, other stakeholders (including intermediaries and nongovernment organizations), \nand  government  (distinguishing  between  the  local  and  national  governments).  The  analysis  will \nexamine the distribution of project costs and financial and economic terms benefits allocated to the \nvarious stakeholders, and estimate the distribution of project effects to the poor to determine the \npoverty impact, as outlined in ADB\u2019s  Handbook for Integrating Poverty Impact Assessment in the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects. \n \nC.  Participation Process \nStakeholder analysis:  During the review of ongoing and completed schemes, the consultants will \nidentify and consult with all stakeholders and determine the roles and functions of the target groups. In \nparticular, the consultants will conduct a rapid rural appraisal or similar approach to gather background \ninformation on the study communities, meet with key individuals and the communities at large, and \nengage in dialogue to identify development needs and constraints. The outcome of this analysis will \nform the basis for proposing selection criteria and specific mechanisms for community inclusion, and \nidentifying target communities under the Project. \n \nParticipation strategy required: The TA will be implemented in a fully participatory manner, and the \nconsultants will organize at least two participatory stakeholder workshops at the national level and at \nleast one for each province selected, during TA implementation,  to discuss the approach and findings \nwith key central, provincial, and district agencies; representatives  of target communities, external \nagencies, NGOs, and research organizations; and other interested parties. \n \nD. Gender and Development \nStrategy  to  maximize  impacts  on  women:  Gender-disaggregated  data  including  benchmark \ninformation and performance indicators will be collected and analyzed using sample surveys and \nparticipatory techniques such as focus group discussions and interviews. The potential role of women \nin  aquaculture  development  will  be  given  ample  focus,  especially  their  potential  role  in  business \ndevelopment and management and strengthening of existing cooperatives and organization. The PPTA \n ", "16  Appendix 4 \nwill ensure that women are provided equal opportunities in trainings especially, in the area of fish \nrearing, marketing, and development of fish value-added products.  \n \nGender plan prepared? The PPTA will provide a full assessment of gender issues in selected sites \nand prepare a detailed plan to address said issues. \n \nE.
