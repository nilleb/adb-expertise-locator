INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in promoting the economic use of \ncustomary  land  in  Samoa  began  with  exploratory  work  under  component  4  of  the  Small \nBusiness Development Project1 (the Project) and the associated technical assistance (TA) for \nCapacity Building of Financial and Business Advisory Intermediaries.2 The Project explored \nways to improve the micro- and small enterprise sector\u2019s access to credit, including through \nstreamlining  leasehold  on  customary  land.  The  subsequent  standalone  TA  for  Promoting \nEconomic Use of Customary Land prepared a program implementation plan (PIP) for customary \nland reforms. 3  Cabinet endorsed the six priority areas identified in the PIP and the Government \nrequested  further  support  from  ADB  and  other  development  partners  to  implement  these \nreforms. ADB's support was initially programmed as a component of the proposed private sector \ndevelopment  cluster  TA  listed  in  the  Samoa  country  partnership  strategy  2008\u20132012. 4 \nSubsequently, the Government requested that ADB's continuing support for customary land \nreforms be a standalone TA project.  \n \n2.  An ADB Fact-Finding Mission was conducted in June 2009 to reach an understanding \nwith the Government on the objectives and scope of the TA, cost estimates, financing plan, \nimplementation arrangements, and the detailed terms of reference for consulting services of the \nTA. The proposed TA has been included in the country program for 2009 in the forthcoming \ncountry operations business plan 2009\u20132011 and is consistent with the strategic objectives of A \nPacific  Strategy  for  the  Asian  Development  Bank  2005\u20132009.5 The  design  and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.6 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  ADB's  country  partnership  strategy  for  Samoa  is  aligned  with  the  Strategy  for  the \nDevelopment  of  Samoa  (SDS)  2008\u201320127 and  supports  its  goals  through  interventions \ntargeting  (i)  improved  delivery  of  public  services,  including  the  removal  of  infrastructure \nconstraints; and (ii) promotion of private sector development. The need for reform to promote \nthe economic use of customary land has been, and continues to be, a high priority for the \nGovernment.  \n \n4.  The SDS provides strong evidence of the important role that customary land reform and \nthe reform of public administration generally play in the economic and social development of \nSamoa. According to the SDS, \n \nThere is a very limited economic use of customary land because property rights \ncannot be mortgaged, the status of leases as collateral for securing loans is \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2000.

Also, the approval process for a lease is cumbersome and prolonged, \ntaking  up  to  12  months.  Means  of  increasing  access  to  customary  land  for \ndevelopment purposes will continue to be investigated in light of the deliberations \nof the Lease of Customary Land Task Force, which was formed in mid-2007; and \nregistration of customary land for leasing will be encouraged. \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Assessment  in  20078 highlighted  that  one  of  the  remaining \nconstraints to private sector development is problematic property rights, in part because of \nuncertainties surrounding customary land issues. The findings of ADB's TA projects for Capacity \nBuilding  of  Financial  and  Business  Intermediaries  and  for  Promoting  Economic  Use  of \nCustomary Land confirmed the above analysis. Issues and concerns highlighted during the \nconsultations undertaken under the TA projects include (i) fears of alienation of customary \nownership of lands, (ii) the rights of titleholders and heirs, (iii) mortgaging of leaseholds, (iv) \nrights of access to leaseholds, (v) the role of the Government in the negotiation of leases, and \n(vi) the establishment of family trusts to either develop or lease the lands. The TA findings also \nconfirmed that the Government is fully committed to its policy of achieving greater economic use \nof customary land by providing the enabling environment to facilitate leasing of such land. High \npriority and emphasis are also placed on community consultations to engage stakeholders in \nthe reform process. The findings further confirmed that the issues surrounding the leasing of \ncustomary land for economic use have particular importance in Samoan culture, and thus there \nis a serious concern among stakeholders that they may not make the right changes. It is \ntherefore  not  surprising  that,  while  many  proposals  have  been  made  in  recent  years,  the \nprocess through which these need to be considered and then, if accepted, implemented, must \nprovide sufficient time for careful and wide discussion with all stakeholders. \n \n6.  The PIP, prepared under the TA for Promoting Economic Use of Customary Land and \nendorsed by Cabinet, recommended six priority areas for customary land reforms:  \n(i)  National  coordination  of  customary  land  stakeholders.  Through  the \nestablishment of a CLAC, a new government approach to customary land will be \ndeveloped and implemented. \n(ii)  Financing development on customary land. Options will be established for \nfinancing development on customary lands and landholders will be encouraged \nto take up those options.   \n(iii)  Legislative reforms. Legislative reforms aim to assist the Government and the \nCLAC in making the necessary legislative changes to allow the implementation of \nthe reforms.  \n(iv)  Capacity building to support customary land administration reforms. This \nwill support the streamlining of processes and strengthen the capacity of the staff \nof the key Government agencies to make the changes effectively and efficiently. \n(v)  Effective community advocacy. An ongoing public information and education \ncampaign will raise public awareness and facilitate community participation in the \nimplementation of the reforms. \n(vi)  Monitoring and evaluation. An approach to economic and financial analysis will \nbe developed to monitor and evaluate the impact of the changes to the economy, \nparticularly benefits derived from leasing customary land. \n \n7.  A number of key factors contributed to the success of the TA for Promoting Economic \nUse  of  Customary  Land  including  (i)  high  level  political  commitment,  (ii)  a  balanced \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2008.

Some key lessons include (i) an appreciation of the sensitivity of land issues, \nrequiring a gradual approach, (ii) the need for ongoing and effective community advocacy, and \n(iii) better clarity in the roles of the lead consulting firm, international and national consultants to \nensure coordinated support. All key success factors and lessons have been incorporated in the \ndesign of this TA project.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The  intended  impact  of  the  TA  is  private  sector  led  economic  growth  that  is  both \nequitable  and  sustainable,  as  prioritized  in  Samoa's  SDS  objectives.  The  impact  will  be \nmonitored through real gross domestic product growth and relevant SDS performance indicators. \nThe expected TA outcome is an improved customary land leasing framework. The achievement \nof the expected outcome will be reflected in an expansion in the types of collateral available, \nand the increase in the number of leases awarded and the amount of leasable customary land \navailable to be utilized for economic purposes. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The TA will support the economic development of customary land with a continued \nemphasis on leasing and exploring options for customary land development by landowners. The \nTA will support the implementation of three priority areas identified in the PIP: (i) national \ncoordination of customary land stakeholders, (ii) capacity building to support customary land \nadministration reforms, and (iii) effective community advocacy. The Government will implement \nreforms in the remaining PIP areas, either through budget support or in collaboration with other \ndevelopment partners. \n \n10.  The specific TA outputs and activities will be: \n(i)  The  establishment  of  the  CLAC  through  preparing  the  terms  of  reference, \nselecting commission members, preparing an operational strategy and providing \ninitial  technical  support.  The  TA  will  also  help  the  CLAC  select  appropriate \nmembers of the various working groups as required to advance the proposed \nreforms. \n(ii)  The establishment of the CLAC secretariat, through selecting secretariat staff, \npreparing the secretariat budget rules, preparing the annual work plans and \nreports, and supporting the customary land forums and WGs.  \n(iii)  The establishment of the one-stop shop to improve services to the community on \ncustomary land matters and to be the primary source of information on options \nfor economic development. As part of setting up the one-stop shop, appropriate \nresources will be allocated and support will be given to staff to develop an \noperational strategy for the unit. \n(iv)  The establishment of a functional database of leased and leasable land, through \ndeveloping a registry of customary land, collecting baseline data to populate the \ndatabase, establishing a depository for Lands and Titles Court documents and \nrecords, and training staff. \n(v)  Effective community advocacy through implementation of the communications \nstrategy already developed to raise awareness and understanding of the reform \n ", "4   \nprogram. The strategy will include the preparation and distribution of materials, \ncontinuing  with  awareness  programs  and  undertaking  regular  public \nconsultations  with  key  stakeholders,  including  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs) and civil society. \n \n11.  The  establishment  of  an  effective  CLAC  is  a  necessary  condition  to  achieving  the \noutcome of the reforms. In April 2009, Cabinet approved the establishment of a CLAC to (i) \nadvise the Government on customary land reforms, (ii) lead the implementation of activities that \npromote  the  economic  use  of  customary  land,  and  (iii)  coordinate  all  customary  land \nstakeholders. While the CLAC will be supported by a secretariat that is yet to be established, \nthe details on how the CLAC will become operational are set out in the PIP. The PIP also \nrecommends the setting up of working groups, which will identify ways to address customary \nland  matters  on  behalf  of  the  CLAC.  The  proposed  working  groups  will  address  various \ncustomary land issues relating to (i) financing and development, (ii) legislative reforms, (iii) \ninformation management, (iv) a one-stop-shop for customary land development, (v) capacity \nbuilding,  (vi)  community  advocacy,  (vii)  economic  and  finance  analysis,  and  (viii)  gender \nanalysis and framework. Details of the operations of CLAC are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n12.  The Government's commitment and willingness to undertake and implement necessary \nreform measures and proposals in the face of possible adverse reactions is essential. The \npossibility that the Government may fail to do so is a risk. Policy dialogue between ADB and the \nGovernment, an effective communication strategy and community participation will help mitigate \nthis risk. Another major risk to customary land reforms in general, as previously experienced, \ncan  be  public  opposition  to  proposed  changes.  The  TA  for  Promoting  Economic  Use  of \nCustomary Land prepared and implemented a successful communications strategy that focused \non continuing and widening community consultations throughout the whole process. Political \ncommitment to reforms can also be affected by domestic and global events like the current \nfinancial and economic crisis and the September 2009 tsunami which may require a change in \nimmediate priorities. Another identified risk would be the reluctance of financial institutions to \naccept leasehold mortgages. The Samoa Housing Corporation and the Development Bank of \nSamoa have expressed interest in piloting this initiative. It is hoped that commercial banks and \nother financial institutions will follow suit should the pilot prove successful. \n \n13.  Given the sensitive nature of customary land, it is envisaged that civil society and NGOs \nwill continue to have an interest in the proposed reforms as shown in their opposition to the \nLand Registrations Act. This highlights the need for continuing public awareness and community \nadvocacy. The Land Registrations Act proposes the use of the Torrens system to register land. \nAlthough the intention is for freehold land, the Act does not exclude customary land. Some 80% \nof land in Samoa is family-owned customary land under the stewardship of the matai or family \nchief. Many fear that if the land is registered under the name of the matai of the day, the rest of \nthe family risk losing their rights over the said land. The Government has continually assured \nthe public that customary land will not be registered under the Torrens system as required by \nthe  Act.  However,  the  Government  should  either  incorporate  such  assurances  through  an \namendment of the legislation, or propose an alternative registration mechanism like through a \nfamily trust arrangement. It is critical therefore that civil society and NGOs be engaged in \ndiscussions and consultations. It is also essential that the communications strategy convey the \nmessage that mobilizing customary land for economic purposes is designed to deliver benefits \nto customary landowners and will not deprive them of their rights. \n \n14.  The TA project will be coordinated very closely with relevant line ministries responsible \nfor customary land issues, particularly the Ministry of Natural Resources, Environment and \n ", "  5\nMeteorology, the Ministry of Justice and Courts Administration, the Ministry of Commerce, \nIndustry and Labour, and the Ministry of Women, Community Affairs and Social Development. \nThere is also a need for effective coordination through regular dialogue and information sharing \nwith other major development partners. The establishment of the joint ADB and World Bank \nfocal office in Samoa will help to further improve coordination among development partners and \nwith the Government. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at the equivalent of $625,000 of which ADB will \nfinance $500,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's TA funding \nprogram (Technical Assistance Special Fund-IV). The Government will finance the equivalent of \n$125,000 in kind through the provision of counterpart staff, office accommodation, and local \ncommunication services. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The Ministry of Finance will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will ensure that TA \nactivities are closely coordinated with the implementing agencies like the Ministry of Natural \nResources, Environment and Meteorology and the Ministry of Justice and Courts Administration \nas well as other key stakeholders. The CLAC will act as the steering committee for the TA and \nthe conduit to Cabinet when decisions require higher level endorsement. The CLAC will be \nsupported by a secretariat as well as a technical working committee selected from its own \nmembership.  \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 3 years, from January 2010 to December \n2012. The longer time frame will allow for proper reporting back and consideration by the CLAC, \nand in some cases Cabinet, of progress at various stages of implementation. ADB will engage \ninternational and domestic consultants through a firm using a quality- and-cost-based selection \nmethod, after seeking simplified technical proposals. The consultants will be engaged according \nto ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Central to \nthe consulting inputs will be the program coordinator/team leader, a national consultant position \nfor 15 person-months, intermittent, to work with the executing agency and the CLAC and \nsupport the agreed coordination process to ensure full implementation and careful monitoring of \nthe TA. This will be supplemented by a pool of short-term international and national experts in \nland information management, capacity building, and public administration. The proposed pool \nof consultants will provide 42 person-months of consulting services comprising 6 person-months \nof international and 21 person-months of national consultants (in addition to the 15 person-\nmonths for the team leader), to carry out the activities as defined in the terms of reference \n(Appendix 3). The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in line with ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook.9 \n \n18.  The team leader will produce a concise inception report outlining the work program and \nmilestones for the duration of the TA, and a final report summarizing the achievements, issues, \nlessons learned, and next steps. Throughout the TA, the team leader will submit (by e-mail) \nbrief monthly progress reports summarizing TA activities, progress, issues, and constraints. \nTeam members will produce outputs (reports) on their respective activities for the team leader's \nprogress and final reports. The team leader's final report will be submitted in draft form at least 5 \n                                                 \n9 ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.
