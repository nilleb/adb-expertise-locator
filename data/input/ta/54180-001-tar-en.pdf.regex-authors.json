The COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support (CARES) Program will support \ngovernment efforts in mitigating the severe economic and social impact of COVID-19. The \nprogram comprises (i) loans of $500 million to help the Government of Bangladesh to expand and \nstrengthen its social safety net for the vulnerable groups including women, as well as to support \nmajor export industries in order to protect jobs, and (ii) a transaction technical assistance (TRTA) \nof $1 million to facilitate the implementation of the program and to improve the overall efficiency \nof the social safety net program.  \n \n2.  The objective of the program is to support the government in mitigating the significant \nadverse social and economic impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and is aligned with \nBangladesh\u2019s Seventh Five Year Plan FY2016\u2013FY2020 goal on inequality and unemployment \nreduced1. Bangladesh\u2019s economy is likely to be severely affected by the slowdown and disruption \nof economic activities, as well as by the spillover effects of the recession in many of its major \ntrade partners. The government\u2019s planned fiscal stimulus program includes an enhanced social \nassistance to the vulnerable groups of the population and job protection programs to support \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and key export industries. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  Beyond the impact of the health crisis, the pandemic will have a severe negative impact \non the economy. Based on IMF projections, the country\u2019s economy growth will drop to 3.8%, the \nlowest growth since 2002. There are three main channels through which the pandemic will affect \nthe economy: (i) slowdown in domestic economy; (ii) sharp decline in exports; and (iii) reduction \nin remittances. To mitigate the negative impact on its economy and protect the affected people, \nthe government announced a fiscal stimulus program and requested ADB to provide a COVID-19 \nsupport and response program of $500 million to complement its implementation. \n \n4.  The program will support government efforts in mitigating the severe social and economic \nimpact of COVID-19. The pandemic is expected to have a lasting negative impact on the \nvulnerable groups including women. As of FY2019, 20.5% of the population live below the poverty \nline of which 10.5% suffer from extreme poverty.2 Almost half of the population live barely above \nthe poverty line\u201485% of the total workforce (for women, 92%) operate in the informal economy, \nliving hand to mouth.3 The livelihood of these small traders, day laborers, and other informal \nworkers is threatened by the nationwide lockdown and the ensuing economic downturn. Most \nwomen in the labor force are concentrated in the informal economy earning wages that barely \nmanage to lift them above the poverty line. Even under normal circumstances, the lack of secure \nemployment, low wages, and discriminatory practices place women in an especially vulnerable \nposition. The impact of COVID-19 further exacerbates this situation. ADB estimates the pandemic \nto put an additional 7.7% of the population (close to 13 million people) under the national poverty \nline.  With  social  distancing  measures  being  put  in  place  and  lockdown  measures  being \nimplemented, there has been a rise in domestic violence as women are forced to stay at home \nwith their abusive partners. The program complements government budget to provide targeted \n \n1  Government of Bangladesh. 2015. Seventh Five Year Plan FY2016-FY2020: Accelerating Growth, Empowering \nCitizens.

This support will be delivered through \nexisting channels for implementation efficiency, while capacity support will be provided through \nthe attached TRTA.  \n \n5.  The social safety net programs in the country have a total budget of Tk 642 billion in \nFY2019, which is equivalent to 2.5% of GDP. These programs comprise cash allowance, public \nworks, humanitarian relief, and education incentives for poor and vulnerable households. Cash \ntransfer programs cover old age allowance, vulnerable women, and persons with disabilities. \nSocial security for about 4.6 million women is ensured through programs for widows, women \noppressed by husbands, and distressed women and through elderly and disabled allowances, in \nwhich women\u2019s quota is set at 50% minimum. However, with only 6.4 million covered under three \nprograms and payment ranging from $2.0 to $8.5 a month, these programs are inadequate in \nterms of coverage and level of support even during normal times. Public work programs such as \nthe 100-day employment generation program pays up to $2.5 in daily wages for the 0.9 million \npoor to perform public work. Despite the broad array of programs available, there is significant \nroom for improvement in terms of efficiency of service delivery and governance to improve \nbeneficiary experience. Nevertheless, these programs provide the best suited channels to deliver \nservices in fighting the pandemic and to upgrade their capacity, will be critical in managing the \ncurrent crisis as well as to prepare for future calamities. \n  \n6.  The social safety net programs need to be further expanded both in terms of budget and \nnumber  of  beneficiaries  because  of  the  recent  impact  of  COVID-19  in  the  country.  The \ngovernment will offer cash aid to poor families that have been hit hard by the ongoing shutdown \namid coronavirus scare. The government has planned one-off transfer Tk 2,000 in cash to each \nof 2 million families, whose breadwinners have lost their jobs because of the lockdown, as part of \nits efforts to keep the most vulnerable segment of the society at home. The government has \nallocated $50 million for this group of people4. Government to Person (G2P) mobile banking \nchannels will be used to transfer this payment. With the government rolling out various pro-poor \nexpenditures through existing social safety net programs to combat the pandemic, more capacity \nsupport development and policy advisory on pandemic response for efficient coordination among \nthe government agencies and structural reforms will be needed. It will also require support for \nstronger monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework to ensure transparency and efficiency. \n  \n7.  In the FY 2019-2020, the government has targeted to include 11.3 million poor people \nunder 17 social protection and several other social safety net programs5. The government has \nplanned to gradually bring all cash transfers under the G2P system. Under this system, payments \nare processed from the government exchequer to the beneficiary\u2019s bank or mobile bank account.  \n   \n8.  The TRTA has the following outputs: (i) support the program implementation by providing \ncapacity support and development; (ii) provide direct support for the delivery of services through \nthe existing social safety net; (iii) introduce new tools and solutions to improve poverty and gender \ntargeting and service delivery, including digital financial services and banking channels; (iv) \ndevelop a gender-responsive plan to improve the social safety net in the country; and (v) improve \nthe monitoring and evaluation capacity and data collection.
