At the 12th Ministerial Conference of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Economic \nCooperation Program in September 2003, the ministers of the six participating countries\u2014\nCambodia, People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, \nThailand, and Viet Nam\u2014reiterated their commitment to pursue a shared vision of growth, \nequity, and prosperity. They also acknowledged that the socioeconomic environment in the \nsubregion had changed significantly since the GMS Program started in 1992. The GMS is now \nmore dynamic and progressive, with increased economic cooperation among the participating \ncountries.  However,  issues  and  challenges  have  also  multiplied,  requiring  even  greater \ncohesiveness and cooperation among the countries if they are to reap the full benefits of \nregional integration and succeed in an increasingly globalized environment.  \n \n2.  The  ministers  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide  continuing \nsupport to the GMS Program to attain these goals. The ministers specified that the support \nshould focus on coordinating, harmonizing, and consolidating the various GMS initiatives and \nactivities  as  well  as  mobilizing  the  corresponding  intellectual  and  financial  resources.  The \ntechnical assistance (TA) will enable ADB to respond to this request for the subregion.1 This TA \nwill allow ADB to not only support the GMS regional cooperation initiative as but also to facilitate \ninteraction among GMS Program stakeholders. The TA will provide the means by which ADB \ncan link all GMS Program initiatives and activities together and to address strategic issues. The \nTA  takes  into  account  corresponding  concerns  raised  in  the  GMS  strategy  and  program \ndocuments.2 \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND ISSUES \n \n3.  The vision of a dynamic and prosperous GMS, with a population substantially free from \npoverty,  can  be  best  pursued  through  a  well-thought-out  strategy  and  the  corresponding \nimplementation of a carefully crafted program. ADB\u2019s support for the GMS Program since 1992 \nhas  greatly  helped  achieve  coherence  and  momentum  in  the  GMS  regional  cooperation \ninitiative. The support framework must be continued. The Program was assessed in an impact \nevaluation study conducted in 1999\u20132000.3 The study\u2019s findings have been taken into account \nin the preparation of this TA paper. \n \n4.  The  key  objective  of  the  GMS  Program  is  to  reduce  poverty  through  enhanced \nconnectivity,  increased  competitiveness,  and  a  greater  sense  of  community.  Many  GMS \nprojects have focused on infrastructure development, aimed at increasing physical connectivity \namong the member countries. Reform and harmonization of policies and regulations have been \nincreasingly  emphasized,  as  has  the  enhancement  of  institutional  and  human  resource \ncapacities  required  to  fully  realize  the  benefits  of  such  connectivity,  and  thus  improve \ncompetitiveness. Programs are also being pursued to address key subregional environment and \nhealth concerns, thereby increasing the awareness of the degree of interdependence in the \nsubregion and the importance of promoting a greater sense of community. Concerns regarding \nthe  impact  of  infrastructure  development  and  enhanced  physical  connectivity  on  the \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet Edition) on 4 May 2004. \n2  ADB. 2004.

", "2    \nenvironment and lives of people, including indigenous peoples and ethnic minorities living in \nborder areas, are being addressed. \n \n5.  Much has been accomplished in the last decade in the broad areas of cooperation under \nthe GMS Program. A significant level of physical connectivity has been achieved, with most \nbasic transport routes already completed or under construction. In power development and \ntrade, several projects are either already operational or on-stream. The GMS countries have \nalso reached broad agreement on various areas of economic exchange, such as facilitating \ncross-border transport of goods and people, and promoting regional power trade.  \n \n6.  In terms of environmental protection and preservation, the GMS countries have laid the \nfoundation for a Strategic Environment Framework to guide investment decisions in critical \nsectors and areas, and to mitigate potentially adverse effects of economic development on the \nenvironment. As interrelated poverty and environmental concerns arise from development of the \nareas along the Mekong, an integrated basin-wide approach to such development underpins \nnatural resources management in the GMS Program, emphasizing the protection of livelihoods \nand prudent management of natural resources. Initiatives to strengthen human resources have \nbeen  undertaken,  such  as  the  implementation  of  the  Phnom  Penh  Plan  for  Development \nManagement4 and the mitigation of the cross-border spread of communicable diseases. \n \n7.  While  broad  agreements  have  been  forged  and  substantial  progress  in  physical \nconnectivity  has  been  made,  the  GMS  ministers  requested  accelerating  the  pace  of \ncooperation.  This  implies  increasing  the  pace  of  implementation  of  the  various  initiatives, \nimproving  the  policy  environment,  and  operationalizing  agreements.  Among  the  major \ncommitments  of  the  GMS  leaders  at  the  first  GMS  Summit  in  November  2002  were  the \ncompletion of the transport corridors and their development into economic corridors, with the \naccelerated implementation of software arrangements for infrastructure linkages, including the \npossible  introduction  of  a  GMS  visa;  acceleration  of  energy  development,  including  the \nimplementation of the Intergovernmental Agreement on Regional Power Trade; and formulation \nof an action plan on trade and investment facilitation. To deepen cooperation and flesh out the \nimplementation aspects of the various initiatives, substantial work will be needed at all levels \nwithin the GMS framework, including sector working groups (SWGs), senior officials\u2019 meetings \n(SOMs), ministerial meetings (MMs), and summit meetings.  \n \n8.  At the 12th Ministerial Conference in Dali, PRC, in September 2003, the GMS ministers \nemphasized the importance of expanding the dialogue with all GMS stakeholders. The ministers \ncalled  for  stronger  involvement  of  development  partners,  not  just  by  providing  financial \nresources,  but  also  by  sharing  their  development  experience  in  the  region.  The  GMS \ngovernments requested ADB to help mobilize strategic development partners and to ensure that \nthe resulting assistance is well coordinated. \n \n9.  Filling the major resource gap between the funding requirements to achieve the goals of \nthe  GMS  Program  and  the  amounts  available  from  ADB  as  well  as  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral development agencies has become a priority. Intensifying resource mobilization has, \ntherefore, become imperative, and the impact and leverage of development assistance that \nADB can provide should be maximized. Concurrently, recent economic reforms and the sound \neconomic growth of countries in the subregion have led to the gradual expansion of the local \n                                                 \n4  ADB approved the Phnom Penh Plan in October 2002. It seeks to build the capacity of middle- and senior-level \nprofessionals in GMS governments. It focuses on public policy and development management. ", "    3 \nbusiness sector and growing interest of foreign investors, thus opening new possibilities for \nprivate sector participation and financing in the GMS Program.  \n \n10.  Recent developments point to new challenges. The setting for regional cooperation has \nchanged significantly since the GMS Program started. Region-wide health concerns such as \nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome and avian flu or new international security threats require \ntimely and innovative responses or a recalibration of existing initiatives. As the facilitator/catalyst \nfor the GMS Program, ADB must be able to provide quick but carefully considered, sound \nguidance on these matters. The various mechanisms and forums of the GMS Program must be \nsufficiently innovative and flexible, providing effective venues for focused discussion of the \nissues and for formulation of timely solutions, thereby enabling the GMS countries to respond to \nthese threats and challenges in a coordinated manner. \n \n11.  The  GMS  Program  has  achieved  its  success  through  forums  and  mechanisms  to \nexchange ideas and agree on joint action. Now that the GMS Program has to address new \nneeds,  issues,  and  challenges,  these  forums,  mechanisms,  and  instruments  require \nstrengthening and streamlining to bring GMS efforts to the next level\u2014that of more intensive \nimplementation and operationalization. As the requirements of the GMS Program and, hence, \nthe focus of the TA through its various phases, evolved, so has the role of ADB in the GMS \nProgram. Starting with a simple role of major provider of financial and technical assistance, ADB \nnow  plays  multiple  roles  in  the  GMS  Program,  such  as  the  main  development  partner \ncoordinating  other  activities  of  other  external  funding  agency  in  the  region,  and  a  broker \ndevising and using means to balance relationships among the member countries. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n  \nA.   Purpose and Output \n \n12.  The TA\u2019s overall goal is to enhance cooperation among the GMS countries in addressing \nkey regional issues to achieve their shared vision of growth, equity, and prosperity in the \nsubregion. Its purposes are to (i) provide essential support for the GMS Program and strengthen \nits role as a key agent of regional cooperation, within the framework of the GMS Regional \nCooperation Strategy and Program; and (ii) sustain and accelerate the momentum of the GMS \nProgram.  Attaining  these  purposes  will  require  strengthening  the  role  and  operational \neffectiveness of the GMS Summit, MMs, SOMs, and SWGs in pursuing the thrusts of the GMS \nProgram. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n13.  The TA will have the following outputs: \n(i)  increased capacity of GMS governments in preparing and implementing GMS \nProgram activities through hands-on learning by the GMS national secretariats \nand concerned units of line agencies in member countries, \n(ii)  enhanced capability of the GMS Program to respond quickly to new demands \nand unforeseen problems and challenges, \n(iii)  increased involvement of stakeholders in the design and implementation of GMS \ninitiatives, \n(iv)  increased resource mobilization for the GMS Flagship Programs, and  \n(v)  improved  information  dissemination  and  awareness  of  the  GMS  Program\u2019s \nstrategic orientation and flagship initiatives. \n \n ", "4    \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n14.  Strengthening the Role of Various Forums. The work plans of the SWGs, SOMs, and \nMMs will be linked more closely to the GMS strategic thrusts and priority flagship programs. \nParticular attention will be paid to further structuring the SOMs and SWGs and ensuring regular \nconsultations. Refining sector strategies, prioritizing and programming projects and activities, \nresolving issues, and formulating action plans for adoption by the MMs, will remain a constant \nobjective  at  the  SWG  and  SOM  levels.  ADB  will  regularly  and  closely  monitor  the \nimplementation of flagship programs, in consultation with the national secretariats and GMS \nunits of line agencies of member countries. The capacities of these secretariats and units are \nthus being strengthened with ADB assistance.5 The output of the various GMS forums will be \nenhanced by the increased participation of development partners and the private sector. The \nwork of these forums will be dovetailed to ensure that key issues are addressed in the lead-up \nto the GMS Summit of Leaders in 2005. \n \n15.   Enhancing  Capacity  to  Respond  to  New  Demands,  Unforeseen  Issues,  and \nChallenges. To be able to effectively and promptly address specific new demands that, based \non recent experience, have arisen in the subregion, capability needs to be built within the GMS \nProgram to undertake quick, problem-specific, and policy-focused studies at the request of the \nGMS member countries. This can be done by providing for the engagement of experts on a \nneeds basis to quickly assess the problems, in coordination with local GMS authorities and ADB \nresident missions, and propose a coordinated response acceptable to the GMS countries and \nADB. The deliverables will be in the form of brief issue-specific and results-oriented reports and \naction plans.  \n \n16.  Increasing  Involvement  of  Civil  Society  and  Stakeholders  in  the  Design  and \nImplementation  of  GMS  Initiatives.  Channels  will  be  expanded  for  consulting  with  and \nobtaining inputs from community-based organizations and nongovernment organizations on \nmajor  GMS  initiatives.  The  output  of  these  engagements  will  be  used  to  enrich  and,  if \nnecessary, reorient the work of the various GMS mechanisms and forums so that they provide \nhighly effective guidance and inputs for the GMS Program.  \n \n17.  Increasing Financial Resource Mobilization for the GMS Flagship Programs. Given \nthe continuing large financial resource requirements of GMS projects and activities, resource \nmobilization will be further intensified in consultation with the GMS countries. Projects with \nsubstantial needs and prospects for cofinancing from development partners will be identified. \nThe development matrix will be used as an important tool in these efforts. \n  \n18.  Improving Information Dissemination and Awareness of the GMS Program. This \ncomponent will aim to generate a greater awareness and commitment to the GMS Program and \nits activities among stakeholders and various target groups. New media instruments will be \ntapped for this purpose, in consultation with the Office of External Relations, such as making the \ndevelopment  matrix  accessible  via  the  Internet,  developing  new  GMS  publications,  and \npreparing and promoting articles on the GMS Program for use by various media. The style and \ncontent of the GMS Web page will also be improved.  \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2001. Capacity Building for National Institutions Involved in the Greater Mekong Subregion Program. Manila \n(TA 6017, approved on 21 December 2001, for $500,000 financed from the Japan Special Fund). The main \nobjective of the TA is to strengthen national secretariats so that the GMS countries can assume greater roles and \nresponsibilities in planning, managing, and coordinating the GMS Program. ", "    5 \n19.  Strengthening the various GMS forums (para. 14) and thrusts and activities (paras. 15\u2013\n18) will be undertaken with the assistance of the TA consultants and utilizing the various \nmechanisms  and  instruments  under  the  GMS  Program.  In  undertaking  the  activities  and \nmeasures  to  improve  the  effectiveness  of  the  various  GMS  forums,  the  consultants  and \nconcerned ADB staff will work in close coordination with and active involvement of the national \nsecretariats and agencies concerned, so that the latter can in the process also enhance their \nskills  and  knowledge.  Within  ADB,  the  Mekong  Department  will  ensure  strengthened \ncoordination and cooperation with the Office of Cofinancing Operations, Office of External \nRelations, Private Sector Operations Department, and Regional and Sustainable Development \nDepartment.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.25 million equivalent, comprising a foreign exchange \ncomponent of $1.00 million and a local currency component of $250,000 equivalent. The foreign \ncurrency component will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The \nparticipating GMS governments will provide the remaining $250,000 equivalent in kind, including \nthe  contributions  for  hosting  the  GMS  Summit,  MM,  SOM,  and  SWG  meetings.  The  cost \nestimates and financing plan for the TA are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  ADB will be responsible for implementing and monitoring the TA in consultation with the \nGMS governments. GMS national coordinators will continue to serve as the focal point for \ncoordinating subregional activities in each member country. \n \n22.  The TA will finance about 80 person-months\u201426 international and 54 domestic\u2014of \nconsultancy  services.  A  core  group  of  consultants  will  provide  advisory,  technical,  and \nadministrative support services to assist in the overall management of the GMS Program. \nConsultants for private sector development and for communications and media affairs as well as \nshort-term consultants to address specific demands will also be engaged. The consultants will \nall be hired as individuals. They will be engaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The consultants\u2019 outline terms \nof reference are in Appendix 3. \n \n23.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months, from August 2004 to July 2005. \n \nIV.   THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis \nfor Strengthening the Greater Mekong Subregion Economic Cooperation Program and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n ", "6 Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \nDesign Summary  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions (A) and \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  Risks (R) \nGoal       \nEnhance cooperation  Statements of stronger  Joint ministerial  A: Political stability and \namong the GMS  commitment to the GMS  statement and joint  mutual trust exist \ncountries in addressing  Program by GMS  summit declaration.  between and among \nkey regional issues and  governments.
