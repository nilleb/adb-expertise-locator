A more secure and sustainable future for Indonesia is contingent on increased \naccess to clean energy. With annual gross domestic product growth averaging 5% during 2009\u20132014, the demand \nfor electricity is projected to rise by more than 8% per annum until 2029. Since Indonesia currently uses coal and oil \nto produce 65% of its electricity and fuel its economic growth, a failure to diversify into cleaner energy sources for \npower generation will magnify the country\u2019s reliance on fossil fuels, constrain its ability to meet rising electricity \ndemand, increase its contribution to global greenhouse gases (GHGs), and heighten exposure to commodity risk. \nThe Government of Indonesia recognizes the economic imperative of sustainable growth and aims to increase the \nshare of renewable energy in the country\u2019s primary energy supply from 5% in 2010 to 23% by 2025 as part of the \nNational Energy Policy. Furthermore, Indonesia recently strengthened its commitment by submitting the following \nintended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) for the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2015: \nan unconditional emission reduction of 29% by 2030 relative to business as usual solely based on domestic \nsupport, with a further reduction of up to 41% if given adequate international support.   \n \nIndonesian power sector overview. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR) is the main policy-\nmaking body for the power sector and thereby, a key driver behind the clean energy targets. It is responsible for \npreparing the laws and regulations for the sector, issuing business licenses, establishing tariff and subsidy policies, \nand guiding the development of the government\u2019s rolling 10-year national power development plans. MEMR plans \nmust be approved by Indonesia\u2019s president after consultations with parliament. However, MEMR\u2019s policies are \nlargely realized through the actions of Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), the state-owned electricity utility which \ncontrols 85% of the country\u2019s installed generating capacity of 51.3 gigawatts (GW), manages power distribution as \ntransmission system owner and operator, and remains the country\u2019s single wholesale purchaser of electricity.1 It \nfacilitates private sector participation in the power generation sector while maintaining control over system planning, \noperation, and pricing. Government approval of PLN tariffs takes the public\u2019s willingness and ability to pay into \naccount. As a result, the retail price of electricity in Indonesia is low and below the  PLN\u2019s average cost of \ngeneration.  The Ministry of Finance is obligated to provide funding to bridge this cost\u2013revenue gap under the \nsupport requirements of a law governing state-owned enterprises, known as the public services obligation (PSO).2  \n \nThe current legal and regulatory framework for the electricity sector is provided by an electricity law adopted in \n2009. The law made MEMR the primary regulatory body and effectively ended PLN\u2019s 60-year monopoly as the only \nelectricity  supplier  in  Indonesia.  PLN  retained  a  right  of  first  refusal  over  any  activity  in  the  power  sector. \nIndependent power producers (IPPs), provincial entities and cooperatives can only engage in power generation \nactivities  in  areas  unserved  by  PLN.  Nonetheless,  IPPs  now  represent  nearly  8GW  of  installed  capacity  in \nIndonesia (15.3% of national capacity) and continue to be an active means of renewable energy development. \n \nDeveloping a nascent wind energy sector. Indonesia is endowed with several renewable energy options that can \nhelp PLN and IPPs contribute to INDC and renewable energy targets, including wind, solar, geothermal, hydro and \nbiomass. Though hydropower and geothermal contribute to 7% and 5% of power generation, with 5.3 GW and 1.4 \nGW installed capacity, respectively, wind resources remain relatively unexplored with upwards of 10  GW of \npotential.3   Wind power has not benefited from extensive analysis in Indonesia over the past few years given the \nlow pressure air at the equator and the implied lower wind speeds. The quality of the resource varies across the \ncountry, with most of the resource reflecting low average wind speeds of 4-7 m/s. However, the development of low \nwind sites has recently gathered pace, driven by technology developments as manufacturers release updated \nproducts. The large majority of these sites are now increasingly economically and technically viable, revealing wind \npower to be a potential contributor to Indonesian sustainable growth. Indonesia\u2019s current pipeline of wind projects \nunder development (i.e. advancement of feasible studies, compilation of comprehensive wind resource data and \nacquisition of requisite permits) now exceeds 300 MW.4 Identified opportunities include 195 MW in South Sulawesi, \n60 MW in Java, and several smaller projects in West Timor and Sumba, among others. \n                                                \n1  Perusahaan Listrik Negara. 2015.

Jakarta (17 November 2015). \n4  Ibid. ", "The government has responded to the growing opportunity by establishing 2025 targets to increase the country\u2019s \ntotal installed wind capacity to 970 megawatts (MW).5 ADB sovereign operations is playing a key role in the \ndevelopment of associated wind tariff regulation, giving private developers, investors and policymakers necessary \nguidance on likely returns of wind projects across the country.  Based on a six-month study by ADB, the guidance \npromotes the principle that costs of wind power generation should not exceed the benefits to Indonesia. Such \nbenefits include the avoided economic cost of fossil fuel displaced by the renewable technology and the avoided \ncost of greenhouse gas emissions. Initial studies show that wind projects in Java, Sulawesi and the eastern islands \nare economic and significant capacity is achievable at or below the benefit caps in these regions. The wind projects \nin Western Indonesia and Sulawesi will likely receive tariffs closer to 15 US cents per kilowatt-hour (USc/kWh), \nwhile diesel-dominated Eastern Indonesian islands can support projects with tariffs greater than 20 USc/kWh.6  The \nissuance of a new pricing regime for wind is expected in 2016. \n \nThe varying tariff recommendations reflect the different benefits wind power can bring across Indonesia. For \nexample, as the largest grid, Java presents the highest capacity to absorb the intermittent power. Low-cost coal \nsupplies over 50% of Java power, so any additional wind capacity will make a tangible impact, improving the energy \nmix. Java also maintains close to 10GW in single- and combined-cycle gas-fired power installed capacity.7 Gas-\nfired power plants are fast responding and can absorb the intermittency usually accompanying renewable energy \npower generation, but the use of natural gas somewhat tempers the potential environmental benefits of wind for the \nJava grid. Nonetheless, applying the benefit cap method ensures that only the most competitive wind projects able \nto  achieve  viability  under  15  USc/kWh  advance.  Consequently,  the  initial  projects  in  Java  will  help  provide \ncompetitive benchmarks for national sector development. For the smaller grids like Nusa Tenggara Barat (NTB), the \ndrive for more sustainable energy comes together with strong economic rationale. NTB\u2019s grid comprises over 40% \ndiesel-power generation, with generation costs nearing 25-30 USc/kWh.  As such, not only does the integration of \nwind power contribute to a cleaner energy mix in NTB, but its potentially lower cost can also increase access to \nenergy while supporting broader PLN sustainability goals.  \n \nDespite these tangible benefits, wind development is slow to gain momentum across the country due to (i) residual \nregulatory risk associated with wind tariff reform and (ii) PLN\u2019s limited experience working with intermittent power. \nTwo power purchase agreements (PPAs) were signed with PLN for projects in Java and South Sulawesi, however, \nneither project has achieved financial close. Moreover, negotiations between other private developers and PLN are \nproceeding very slowly. Few wind developers are fully ready to pursue requisite feasibility assessments\u2014including \ntechnical, commercial, environmental and social analysis\u2014to establish project viability. Facilitating early stage \nreviews is a critical next step to reduce perceived challenges associated with the development and commissioning \nof the first generation of Indonesian wind power projects. \n \n8.  TA Description: The PPTA will support grid integration and environmental/social studies across three sites. The \ngrid integration studies will investigate the robustness of the grid structure and make specific recommendations \nfor grid upgrade in order to absorb the instability of electrical output for each site. Working with local PLN \ncounterparts and modeling local grid conditions is essential for the next generation of wind projects because \nPLN currently does not have the capacity or proper tools to manage standard integration of intermittent power. \nThe environmental and social assessments will include reviews of environmental constraints analyses, as well \nas biodiversity and socio-economic baseline studies required by the Indonesian government, international best \npractice and ADB safeguards for wind farm development.  \n \nThe PPTA will be implemented by PACE Energy (\u201cPACE\u201d or \u201cthe Sponsor\u201d), a joint-venture between leading \nFrench renewable energy independent power producer, EREN, and CWP Energy Asia. EREN has over 500MW \nof renewable energy projects in operation or under construction globally and was founded by the ex-CEO of \nEDF Energies Nouvelles. CWP Energy Asia was founded by the Directors and Management team of CWP \nRenewables, a wind development company that successfully developed more than 1,000 MW of wind power in \nAustralia, and Wind Prospect, a wind energy consultancy firm. PACE is focused on the development of wind \n                                                \n5 Meier, Peter, Pramod Jain, Paul Ridden, Djoko Prasetijo, Berliana Yusuf. 2015.

The Sponsor used internal wind flow modelling based on mesoscale and \nonsite wind data to identify sites with potential wind resource and suitable for the development of a wind farm.10  \n \na.  Link to Country Partnership Strategy/Regional Cooperation Strategy: ADB assistance for the Project is \naligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 which supports environmentally sustainable, private sector assisted \ndevelopment in meeting the growing energy demand in the region. The assistance is also aligned with \nthe CPS for Indonesia 2010-2014, interim COBP 2015-2017 and the new draft CPS, specifically the \nstrategy\u2019s second pillar of environmental sustainability through climate change mitigation.  \n \nThe Project will ultimately increase the renewable energy capacity in Indonesia, helping meet the \ncountry\u2019s rapidly growing demand for power in a more sustainable manner. In addition, ADB recognizes \nthat the Project is aligned with Indonesia\u2019s broader initiatives to achieve the national targets of (1) \nincreasing the use of renewable energy to 23% by 2025 and (2) reducing greenhouse gas emissions by \nat least 29% by 2030. The assistance maintains ADB\u2019s broad support for the first generation of credible \nwind developers in Indonesia and complements private sector development (PSD) elements of public \nsector wind policy assistance. The Project will also demonstrate the viability and sustainability of private \nsector wind developments in provinces across various grids with different size and demand profiles. \n \nb.  Impact: The impact of the PPTA is the increased power supply from renewable energy sources in the \nBanten and NTB regions of West and Central Indonesia. The development of three wind power farms \nproviding up to a total of 150 MW of installed capacity will contribute to generate and deliver to the grid \nmore than 300 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of wind power per annum once the project starts operations.  The \nProject\u2019s operations will help meet Indonesia\u2019s target of 23% of energy generation from renewable \nsources and lower GHG emissions by at least 29% by 2030 relative to business as usual solely based \non domestic support, with a further reduction of up to 41% if given adequate international support.   \n \nc.  Outcome: The outcome of the PPTA will lead to construction of at least one wind farm developed under \nthe PPTA by Q1 2018 and at least 50MW capacity commissioned by Q4 2018. \n \nd.  Outputs: Under the PPTA, consultants will prepare grid integration studies, environmental and social \nbaseline and red-flag assessments for two sites in Banten and one site in NTB, all specific to the \nproposed project sites, and completed by July 2017. \n \n9.  Assumptions and risks: The assumptions include in-kind support from the Sponsor and ongoing progress in \nwind tariff regulation. Risks are related to project implementation and include: project\u2019s construction, EPC, \ntechnology, wind resource, O&M, off-take and regulatory risks are customary for project financing of this nature. \nThese risks will be addressed through appropriate mitigating measures at the project financing stage. \n10.

POVERTY IMPACT AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS \nA.  Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nADB assistance for the Project is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 which supports environmentally sustainable, \nprivate sector assisted development in meeting the growing energy demand in the region. The assistance is also \naligned with the CPS for Indonesia 2010-2014, interim COBP 2015-2017 and the new draft CPS, specifically the \nstrategy\u2019s second pillar of environmental sustainability through climate change mitigation.  \n \nThe Project will ultimately increase the renewable energy capacity in Indonesia, helping meet the country\u2019s rapidly \ngrowing demand for power in a more sustainable manner. In addition, ADB recognizes that the Projects are aligned \nwith Indonesia\u2019s broader initiatives to achieve the national targets of (1) increasing the use of renewable energy to \n25% by 2025 and (2) reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 26% by 2020. The assistance maintains ADB\u2019s \nbroad support for the first generation of credible wind developers in Indonesia and complements private sector \ndevelopment (PSD) elements of public sector wind policy assistance. The Project will also demonstrate the viability \nand sustainability of private sector wind developments in provinces across various grids with different size and \ndemand profiles. \n \nThe PPTA will support grid integration and environmental/social feasibility/baseline studies across three sites. The \ngrid integration studies will investigate the robustness of the grid structure and make specific recommendations for \ngrid upgrade in order to absorb the instability of electrical output for 3 target sites in Western Java and West Nusa \nTenggara (NTB) regions in Indonesia. The development of these wind power farms will contribute to generate and \ndeliver power to the grid and help meet Indonesia\u2019s target of 25% of energy generation from renewable sources and \nlower GHG emissions by 26% by 2020.  \nB.
