The Asian Development Bank (ADB) first reviewed the agriculture sector of the Kyrgyz \nRepublic in 1995 as part of the feasibility study to prepare the Agriculture Sector Program \nLoan.1  The  project  performance  audit  report2  rated  the  program  loan  as  successful,  and \nrecommended a further review of the agriculture sector. The technical assistance (TA) was \nincluded in the country strategy and program for 2004\u20132006.3 An ADB fact-finding mission \nvisited the Kyrgyz Republic in June 2004 to hold discussions with key officials of relevant \ngovernment  agencies  and  reached  an  understanding  with  the  Government  on  the  TA's \nobjectives, scope, implementation arrangements, cost estimates, financing arrangements, and \nterms of reference for consultants. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Since independence in 1991, the Kyrgyz Republic has undertaken a comprehensive \nreform program particularly in the agriculture sector, which has helped the sector to recover \nfrom a rapid decline in performance immediately after its independence from the Soviet Union. \nThe sector has grown consistently since 1996 with an average annual growth rate of about \n7.4% (1996\u20132002) compared with 4.7% for the economy as a whole. The sector accounts for \n35% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP), employs about 52% of the total workforce, \nand accounts for about 11% of exports (2002).  \n \n3.  About 66% of the country\u2019s population live in rural areas and depend on agriculture for \ntheir livelihoods. In the Kyrgyz Republic in 2003, 40.8% of the population was living in absolute \npoverty, a decline from 44.4% in 2002. Nutrition-based poverty declined from 17.8% in 2000 to \n9.4% in 2003.4 The poverty incidence in rural areas declined in 1998\u20132003 largely due to the \nbetter performance of the agriculture sector and higher average real wages. However, poverty \nin rural areas continues to be significantly higher than in urban areas, with about three quarters \nof the poor people living in rural areas. There are significant regional differences in poverty and \nmuch of the population lives very close to the margin between poor and non-poor, thus creating \na significant degree (about 39% in 2001) of transient poverty. \n \n4.  Kyrgyz Republic is facing a serious debt situation (116% of GDP at the end of 2002) and \nthe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has required a reduction in the externally financed public \ninvestment  program  to  3%  in  2005.  This  will  substantially  reduce  lending  by  multilateral \nagencies. ADB is estimating a lending program of about $40 million over the next 3 years, \ncompared with about $70 million in previous years.  \n \n5.  The agriculture sector is key to the growth and poverty reduction objectives of the \nGovernment.  The  development  of  the  agriculture  sector  is  currently  guided  by  the \nComprehensive  Development  Framework  (to  2010)  and  the  National  Poverty  Reduction \nStrategy for 2003\u20132005. Further guidance is provided in Presidential Decree 142 of 17 April \n2004. The priority directions to 2010 are cooperative development; development of peasant \nfarms and  agribusiness entities; expansion of rural credit, mortgages, and insurance; land \nregistration;  seed  and  cattle  breeding;  research  and  marketing;  agriculture  extension  and \n                                                 \n1\n  ADB. 1995.

Efforts are currently in progress to provide more specific guidance to the development of \nthe agriculture sector. The Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources and Processing Industry \n(MAWRPI), with the assistance of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), \nhas recently finalized the Agrarian Policy Concept of the Kyrgyz Republic to 2010 (APC). The \nAPC was approved by Government Resolution 465 on 22 June 2004. The APC was prepared in \na participatory process including the establishment of interministerial technical working groups \nand stakeholder workshops bringing together government, private sector, civil society, and \nexternal  funding  agencies.  MAWRPI  has  also  commenced  preparation  of  a  Package  of \nMeasures for crop development, livestock development, water resources, marketing, agricultural \nprocessing, and other services. These matrixes reflect the importance MAWRPI is placing on \ndefining a more specific program of action to support agricultural development. \n \n7.  The APC and Package of Measures are important for developing country ownership and \nleadership  in  formulating  agricultural  policies  and  strategies  and  developing  participatory \nprocesses  to  seek  broad-based  stakeholder  involvement.  The  two  documents  give  a \ncomprehensive overview of the range of activities needed to increase agricultural productivity. \nHowever, they do not give clear guidance on key policy priorities that will determine where \nagriculture should be in 5\u201310 years, or strategies that will determine how the capacity and \nresources of government, private sector, civil society, and development partners can be most \nefficiently and effectively used for the development of the sector. \n \n8.  The agriculture sector is receiving substantial support from multilateral and bilateral \nagencies.  MAWRPI's  capacity  for  policy  and  strategy  development,  public  investment \nprogramming  and  management,  monitoring,  and  aid  coordination  is  developing  slowly  to \naccommodate  the  increasing  number  and  diversity  of  development  partner  activities. \nCoordination  among  development  partners  is  generally  increasing  and  is  being  formalized \nthrough  the  establishment  of  a  council  to  coordinate  aid,  comprising  representatives  of \ndevelopment agencies. The Kyrgyz Republic also has a national action plan on harmonization \nof aid agencies' procedures on financial management and procurement. Within the agriculture \nsector,  exchanges  of  information  and  discussion  of  various  project  activities  have  been \nincreasing.5  \n \n9.  The importance of agriculture to the economy, the diversified funding support, and the \nconstraints faced by the agriculture sector (including capacity in MAWRPI), place even greater \nemphasis on the need for the sector to have a well defined strategy based on sound policies \nand leading to development plans supported by coordinated aid support. The Government has \nrequested assistance to facilitate the formulation of a realistic and effective policy and strategy \nfor the development of the sector. \n \n10.  This TA will initiate a preprogram-based approach6 (PBA) for the further comprehensive \nand coordinated development of the agriculture sector. This pre-PBA will include a broad sector \n                                                 \n5\n For example, during the fact-finding mission for the TA, a separate donor\u2019s meeting was convened to discuss the \nTA and was attended by 10 donor partners and 6 representatives attended the joint wrap-up meeting with \nMAWRPI, Office of the President, the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, and MOF. \n6\n  \u201cA PBA is a way of engaging in development cooperation based on the principle of coordinated support for a locally \nowned program of development. The approach includes four key elements: leadership by the host country; a single \nprogram and budget framework; donor coordination and harmonization of procedures; and efforts to increase the \nuse of local procedures over time with regard to program design and implementation, financial management, and ", "3 \nreview as the basis for developing high priority policies and the legislation that will be needed to \nunderpin these and facilitate the preparation of a medium-term strategy that will effect those \npolicies, and time-bound plans of actions and financing to implement the strategy. The TA will \nalso pursue increased coordination and cooperation among development partners in strategies, \nprograms, and project activities.  In this process, the TA will build on MAWRPI's efforts in \nstakeholder  participation;  increase  ownership  of  the  policy  and  strategy;  and  enhance \npartnerships with the private sector, civil society, and multilateral and bilateral development \nagencies. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n11.  The goal of the TA is to facilitate the adoption of a PBA to develop a market-oriented \nagriculture sector. The purpose is to develop a policy, strategy, and action plan for agriculture to \n2015. To achieve these objectives the TA will have the following components and key outputs: \n(i) For policy development, the TA will support identification and elaboration by the Government \nof  its  vision  for  agriculture  and  the  priority  policy  areas,  drawing  on  the  Comprehensive \nDevelopment Framework, the National Poverty Reduction Strategy, and APC. (ii) For strategic \nplanning, the TA will support preparation of a medium-term strategy (2015), by means of which \nthe agreed policies can be effected. A series of action plans will provide the basis for the \nimplementation of the strategy and a mechanism for the monitoring and evaluation of the \nprogress of the plans will be developed. The action plan for each priority area will include \nobjectives, scope, time frame for implementation, responsibilities, costs (including capital and \nrecurrent), and financing arrangements from both the budget and donor programs. (iii) For aid \ncoordination and cooperation, aid agencies will seek to agree on a set of principles for their \nsupport to the sector and will seek endorsement of these by the Government so that they feed \ninto the setting of policy and strategy development. In addition, aid agencies will seek improved \ncoordination of their strategies, programs, and project activities. In the process, the Government \nofficials will acquire an enhanced understanding of policy and strategy formulation and will be \nultimately responsible for the preparation of policy statements, strategy, and action plans. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The  TA  will  support  the  formulation  of  policy,  strategy,  and  action  plans  by  the \nGovernment through a participatory process to ensure widespread agreement and ownership of \nthe expected outputs. In addition to extensive participation by MAWRPI, active participants in \nthe TA process will include key agencies (Office of the President, Prime Minister\u2019s Office, and \nMinistry of Finance), and representatives of parliament, oblast governments, private sector, \nacademia,  civil  society,  farmers\u2019  organizations,  and  multilateral  and  bilateral  development \norganizations.  The  participatory  approach  will  extend  staff  knowledge  and  experience  in \nparticipatory processes; formulation of policy, strategy, and actions plans; and dialogue and \nnegotiation  with  external  funding  agencies.  The  process  approach  will  involve  seminars, \nincluding some on-the-job training in policy and strategy formulation, national workshops and \nconferences involving broad coverage of stakeholders, and working groups focusing on specific \naspects of the strategy and action plans. \n \n13.  The TA will be conducted in two phases. Phase I will focus on two key outputs: the \nestablishment  of  a  Government  \"vision\"  and  enabling  policy  priorities,  and  agreement  on \n                                                 \nmonitoring and evaluation\u201d cited in Lavergne, R. and A. Alba. 2003. CIDA Primer on Program-Based Approaches. \nCanada: CIDA. ", "4 \nprinciples for partner support.  Only if the two outputs are fully attained will the TA proceed with \nphase II. A national conference will be held at the end of phase I to consolidate the agreements \nand review phase II outputs and activities. \n \n14.  Phase  II  will  build  on  the  two  outputs  of  phase  I  and  continue  consultations  with \nstakeholders  through  meetings,  focus  groups,  and  workshops  to  develop  a  medium-term \nstrategy  and  action  plans  for  further  policy  reform,  institutional  development,  and  public \ninvestment;  develop  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  assessing  the  progress  and \nachievements of the policy and strategy; reconcile funding partner strategies, programs, and \nproject  activities;  and  improve  the  effectiveness  of  stakeholder  participation.  Preliminary \nstrategy and action plans will be presented at a strategy and action plan workshop. Revisions \nwill be made and a final strategy and action plans presented to MAWRPI and key Government \nagencies for agreement. A national conference will present the final policy, strategy and action \nplans to all stakeholders. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $750,000 equivalent, comprising $446,200 in \nforeign exchange costs and $303,800 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will finance \n$600,000 equivalent comprising the entire foreign exchange costs and $153,800 equivalent of \nthe local currency costs. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding \nprogram.  The Government, through the provision of counterpart staff, office space and facilities, \nand miscellaneous administration and support costs, will finance in kind the remaining portion of \nthe  local  currency  costs  equivalent  to  $150,000.  The  TA  will  include  the  procurement  of \nequipment (computers, facsimile machine, and photocopier) primarily for the Department of \nAgrarian Policy and Investment in MAWRPI. The equipment will remain with MAWRPI at the \ncompletion of the TA.  More detailed cost estimates and financing plan are given in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  As the focus on phase I of the TA is on determining a Government vision and policy \npriorities and coordination of development partner principles, the Executing Agency will be the \nOffice of the Prime Minister. The head of the Department of Agricultural and Industrial Complex \nand Natural Resources Management will be the coordinator. MAWRPI  will be the Executing \nAgency for phase II. \n \n17.  An interministerial committee will be established for phase I to determine the vision and \npolicy priorities. The committee will be chaired by a senior official of the Office of the Prime \nMinister. A council of development partners will be established by MAWRPI and will comprise \nrepresentatives of all partners active in the sector. MAWRPI will form a steering committee to \nwork with the consultants in the preparation of the policy, strategy, and action plans. The \nsteering committee is to be chaired by the minister, with representatives of senior staff of \nMAWRPI, Office of the President, Office of the Prime Minister, Ministry of Finance, and other \nrelevant Government agencies. The steering committee will meet at least monthly, and more \noften if necessary. As required, working groups will be established to assist in the formulation of \nthe strategy and action plans. \n \n18.  MAWRPI will assign counterpart staff to work with the consultants to facilitate meetings \nand data collection within MAWRPI. The TA will commence in December 2004 and will be \nimplemented over a period of about 12 months, with phase I being 4 months and phase II 6 \nmonths. About 1\u20132 months may elapse between the phases, to review phase I and revise the \nrequirements for phase II, if necessary. ", "5 \n19.  A total of up to 16 person-months of international consulting services and 57 person-\nmonths of domestic consulting services will be required. Core international consultants will \ninclude a policy adviser (1.5 person-months in phase I) and an agriculture sector specialist-team \nleader  (4  person-months  in  phase  I  and  5  person-months  in  phase  II).  Core  domestic \nconsultants for both phases will include an agriculture sector specialist and deputy team leader \n(10  person-months),  institutional  specialist  (6  person-months),  legal  specialist  (8  person-\nmonths), and a public expenditure specialist (6 person-months). In addition, up to 5.5 person-\nmonths  of  international  consulting  services  and  27  person-months  of  domestic  consulting \nservices, as required, will be used after the policy priorities and key strategy areas are defined \nby the Government, for additional expertise required or to extend the services of the core \nconsultants,  if  necessary.  The  expertise  may  be  related  but  not  limited  to  institutional \ndevelopment, agribusiness, rural finance, public expenditure management, participation, social \nand  gender  issues,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  agricultural  legislation,  natural  resource \nmanagement, and/or technical expertise.  A consulting firm will be selected and engaged by \nADB for the whole period of the TA, in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. A \nsimplified technical proposal procedure using the quality- and cost-based selection procedure \nwill be adopted for recruiting the consulting firm. Equipment purchased under the TA will be \nprocured by the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Procurement. The team \nleader can use up to 5 person-months of domestic resource persons on specific topics to \nstrengthen the preparation of the strategy and actions plans.  Outline terms of reference for the \nstudy are provided in Appendix 3.  \n \n20.  An inception report will be prepared at the end of the first month. Government and aid \nagency representatives will meet to review the report. In phase I, a draft review of government \nand donor literature, an analytical framework to facilitate the development of the Government \n\"vision\" and policy statement, and a paper outlining a PBA mechanism for the Kyrgyz Republic \nwill be prepared, by the end of 10 weeks. Government and aid agency representatives will \ndiscuss the papers at a workshop. The phase 1 report will be prepared, after 3.5 months, for a \nnational conference, to obtain consensus on the policy priorities and development principles for \nimproved  coordination.    This  national  conference  will  be  held  at  the  end  of  phase  I  and \nproceedings prepared for subsequent discussion by Government and agency representatives \non if and how to proceed in phase II.  \n \n21.  In phase II, the preliminary strategy will be prepared by the end of 2 months after phase \nII commences. A workshop will be held to discuss the preliminary strategy at 2.5 months, and a \nfinal strategy prepared by the end of 3 months. Actions plans will be prepared in parallel with the \nstrategy,  and  the  preliminary  action  plan  draft  will  be  discussed  in  a  workshop  with  the \npresentation of the final strategy at 3.5 months. The final action plans will be presented at a \nworkshop at the end of 4.5 months. The draft final policy, strategy, and actions plans will be \nprepared by the end of 5 months and presented at a national conference at the end of 5.5 \nmonths. Following the conference and further discussion with Government and development \npartners,  the  final  report  will  be  presented  at  the  end  of  6  months.  Government  and \ndevelopment partner consultations and discussion will be held at regular intervals to monitor \nprogress, provide direction, and provide the necessary approvals for the TA to proceed. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  for  Agricultural  Strategy  Formulation,  and  hereby \nreports this action to the Board.
