The Asian Development Bank (ADB) 2003 Country Strategy and Program Update for the \nIslamic Republic of Pakistan1 includes the provision of an advisory technical assistance (TA) for \nCapacity Building of Sindh Devolved Social Services,2 proposed for ADB financing in 2004. \nDuring a review mission of the Sindh Devolved Social Services Program (DSSP)3 in March \n2004, the Sindh provincial government (SPG) indicated that it had adequate resources for \ncapacity building in the education and health sectors under the ADB-financed TA loan but still \nrequired  assistance  for  water  supply  and  sanitation  (WSS)  and  solid  waste  management \n(SWM),  referred  to  as  environmental  management.  The  TA  is  crucial,  as  it  will  help  the \nGovernment  improve  the  policy  framework  and  strategic  planning  in  environmental \nmanagement, which is a condition for the second and third tranche release of the DSSP. The \nTA will pave the way for ADB assistance of urban improvements in Sindh. The ADB Fact-\nFinding Mission visited Pakistan on 12\u201316 July 2004, reaching a preliminary understanding with \nthe  Government  on  the  goals,  scope,  terms  of  reference  of  the  TA,  implementation,  and \nfinancing arrangements.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Lack of Adequate WSS Schemes. Pakistan has over 141 million people, and one of its \nmost pressing needs over the next quarter century will be to manage a rapidly increasing \npopulation and to provide basic amenities: food, domestic water supply, waste management \nand power requirements. Significant disparities in average income levels for rural and urban \npopulations  exist  throughout  Sindh,4  as  well  as  the  rest  of  the  country;5  consequently, \ndifferences in the availability of services are also significant. Two thirds of Sindh lies either in the \nbrackish water zone or in the desert zone; only 17%  lies in the freshwater zone. Rainfall is low, \nand most rural people extract water from the Indus River and its irrigation system. In rural and \nurban areas, drinking water is often polluted and distributed without treatment. In rural areas, \npiped water supply covers 14% and hand pumps 41%; the remaining 45% of households rely on \nunsafe water such as uncovered wells, rivers, and rain- or canal-fed ponds. Karachi\u2019s bulk water \nsupply  is  only  sufficient  to  support  66%  of  its  population,  while  the  remaining  population \ndepends on water vendors.6 Water and sanitation infrastructure has often been developed \nwithout a master plan or an analysis of operation and maintenance (O&M) costs, so that several \nschemes  have  been  abandoned.  Sewage  treatment  is  generally  absent  throughout  Sindh, \nexcept in Karachi.7 In rural Sindh, 53% of the population lacks access to basic sanitation \nfacilities. The lowest-income groups, especially women and children, face serious problems in \nmeeting their water supply needs, and water-related diseases are common. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003 Country Strategy and Program Update (2003\u20132006): Pakistan. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 27 May 2004.  \n3  ADB. 2003 Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Program and \nTechnical Assistance Loans to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Sindh Devolved Social Services Program. \nManila. \n4  Sindh is one of Pakistan\u2019s four administrative provinces, covering 140,900 km2 (17.7% of the total area) and with a \npopulation of 32.3 million (22.9% of the total). \n5  Half of Sindh\u2019s population is urban, of which 35.2% is poor, living on less than a dollar a day, while 39.8% of the \nrural population is poor (ADB. 2001. Poverty Assessment Report. Manila).  \n6  Water supply is mostly from surface water sources, although groundwater supplies account for up to 0.2 million \ngallons a day. The estimated demand is 265\u2013300 million gallons per day, of which approximately 70% is treated in \nfiltration plants. Six water treatment plants exist and one more is planned. Water losses due to the deterioration of \npipelines have been estimated at 30\u201335% of the total water extracted.  \n7  An estimated 50\u201360% of the city\u2019s sewage is treated; the remainder is discharged to the sea untreated. Karachi\u2019s \nthree operating sewage treatment plants, with a capacity of 150 million gallons a day, suffer operational problems. \nKarachi has no dedicated treatment plant for industrial waste, which is disposed of untreated. \n ", " 2  \n \n3.  Poor SWM. Solid waste generated in Pakistan ranges from 0.283 to 0.612 kg per capita \nper day, with a reported growth rate of 2.4% per year. Despite marginal improvements reported \nby the United Nations Development Programme and Japan International Cooperation Agency \n(JICA),8 SWM is becoming an issue of growing concern throughout Pakistan, especially in \nSindh, where solid waste is randomly disposed of in open land and drains or burned in an \nuncontrolled manner. Informal recycling systems9 cover only certain types of waste10 and suffer \nfrom high inefficiencies, while hazardous pollutants are disposed of in a random and unsafe \nmanner. Karachi and Hyderabad have a substantial number of registered industries, but also \nmany smaller businesses operating without a license, which often generate industrial, toxic, and \nhazardous waste, potentially discharged into the sewage system with other domestic waste. \nSindh has a number of inpatient hospitals, clinics, and small hospitals. Except for a few hospital \nincinerators in Karachi,11 medical facilities are often not properly equipped; thus, up to 65% of \nhazardous clinical waste is disposed of in domestic landfill sites. The poor are more exposed \nthan others to health hazards arising from poor hygienic and toxic conditions, through living or \nworking in contaminated environments. \n \n4.  Weak Institutional Capacity and Regulatory and Policy Framework. Several federal \nand  Sindh  water  laws12  have  been  enacted,  including  the  National  Environmental  Quality \nStandards, but enforcement has been limited. The first comprehensive national water policy is \nto  be  presented  for  Cabinet  approval  in  2004.  The  Pakistan  water  sector  strategy  and \nassociated medium-term investment plan are in preparation. They will identify key issues and \nobjectives for the water sector and propose plans to develop and manage water resources in all \nwater subsectors at a national level. Despite efforts from various agencies, no national or \nprovincial  policies  or  standards  for  solid  waste  disposal  have  been  promulgated.13  Local \ninitiatives14 have generally been isolated efforts. Policies and strategies at national level may not \naddress provincial needs and conditions. The institutional context of SWM and WSS is in flux. \nUnder Pakistan\u2019s Devolution Plan, district governments headed by the taluka or town nazims \nare responsible for planning, investment, and control of municipal services, including water \nsupply, sanitation, and solid waste disposal. After devolution, the Public Health Engineering \nDepartment (PHED) merged with the Local Government Department, and responsibilities for \nplanning and operating schemes were devolved to the tehsil municipal administrations (TMAs). \nPartly  due  to  lack  of  funds  and  capacity  to  execute  these  new  responsibilities  and  partly \nbecause PHED, through its Hyderabad technical division and district support units, continues to \nexert influence and manage the technical, financial, and administrative aspects of WSS, the \nTMAs  have  not  properly  assumed  the  responsibilities  envisaged  under  the  Sindh  Local \n                                                 \n8  JICA and JBIC have started to support the SPG's efforts in SWM and WSS in Karachi, including proposals to build \nsolid waste transfer stations and conduct a study on industrial waste. \n9  These include large-scale waste dealers (1,000 are reported to operate in Karachi), and original initiatives taken by \nNGOs  such  as  Gul  Bahao  through  its  \u201cSafai  Kamai\u201d  garbage-purchasing  bank,  the  Pakistan  Environment \nRecycling Program, and Sheri\u2019s solid waste management public awareness activities. \n10 Urban Resource Centre. 2001. Pre-feasibility Study for the Sindh Governor\u2019s Task Force for the Improvement of \nMunicipal Services. Available: www.urckarachi.org/SWM%20karachi.htm. \n11 Approximately 500 to 600 public and private sector hospitals, maternity homes, and dispensaries are functioning in \nKarachi. Incineration facilities are few and only available at reputed hospitals such as the Agha Khan Hospital. \n12 Significant laws include (i) Indus River System Authority Ordinance 1992; (ii) Pakistan Environmental Protection \nAct,  1997;  (iii)  National  Environmental  Quality  Standards,  2002,  at  the  national  level;  (iv)  Karachi  Water \nManagement Board Ordinance 1981; and (v) Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) Act 1996 in Sindh. \n13 Within the context of a sustainable development strategy, efforts in Sindh have recently been initiated by the \nPlanning and Development Department and the World Conservation Union, which will address SWM in the context \nof a sustainable development strategy.  \n14 In 2002, KWSB prepared a draft water policy including development of alternative sources, wastewater recycling, \nreduction in water losses, asset renewal and expansion, improved services, revenue collection, and cost recovery.  \n ", "      3\nGovernment Ordinance (2001). The financial performance of institutions has been compromised \nby poor recovery of bills, overstaffing, and theft of water.  \n  \n5.  Lack of Private Sector Participation. Although the Sindh Local Government Ordinance \n(2001)  envisages  substantial  public-private  partnerships  for  improving  service  delivery  and \nstresses ways of involving communities, there is little evidence of practical implementation of \nthese principles to encourage private investors in the water utilities and SWM sectors.15 The \nwater  agencies  and  municipal  bodies  traditionally  charged  with  managing  water  supply, \nwastewater,  and  solid  waste  suffer  from  financial  weaknesses  that  prevent  them  from \ngenerating capital to rehabilitate, improve and expand infrastructure and facilities.16 So far, \nprivate sector participation in Sindh has been limited, with some WSS construction efforts by \nrural community-based organizations (CBOs) 17, a few community-level solid waste collection \nactivities, and a few private contracts for Karachi\u2019s larger treatment and disposal operations.18 \nThe Government recognizes that private sector resources are needed to meet the demands of \ngrowing urban and rural communities and  to safeguard the environment; yet, inadequate cost \nrecovery mechanisms may deter further involvement of the private sector.  \n \n6.   Lessons from Previous Experience. Lessons derived from previous ADB projects in \nthe sector in Sindh show that (i) urban upgrading should be designed from a plan that integrates \nall aspects of urban infrastructure and involves participation of beneficiaries, (ii) institutional \ncapacity must be present, and (iii) the financial framework must be in place to ensure long-term \nsustainability. This TA is intended to enhance ongoing institutional restructuring and formulate \ndevelopment policies, strategies, and action plans for WSS and SWM in Sindh. The TA will \nidentify planning principles to enhance community and stakeholder participation, options, and \nopportunities to increase cost recovery through an effective tariff system, improve financial \nmanagement and build private sector confidence for future investment, and identify technical \nand management choices for environmental sustainability. The TA supports Pakistan\u2019s Ten-\nYear Perspective Development Plan (2001-2011). 17 The TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s Country \nStrategy  and  Program  (2002-2006),19  which  emphasizes  supporting  governance  reform \nprograms and devolution, reducing rural poverty, providing basic urban services and water, and \nincreasing efforts toward sustainable environmental management.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n7.  The TA goal is to improve sustainable environmental management, health, and living \nconditions in Sindh. The TA aims to help the Government develop a participatory strategic \nplanning framework to improve rural and urban environmental conditions in Sindh. Specific \noutputs  designed  to  achieve  this  goal  and  purpose  are  (i)  a  cross-sectoral  review  of \ndevelopments, issues, and concerns in the SWM and WSS sectors; (ii) policies, strategies, and \naction plans for SWM and WSS sectors in the different districts of Sindh; and (iii) an appropriate \n                                                 \n15  Initiatives were taken under ADB\u2019s Decentralization Support Program. \n16 Tariffs, regulated by the SPG, are based on social and political factors rather than cost recovery. \n17 These efforts comprise UNICEF funded rural WSS project with community participation as well as Sindh Graduate \nAssociation community development schemes, then transferred to communities for operation and maintenance. \n18 Private sector participation in Karachi includes an operation-and-maintenance contract for Karachi\u2019s Mauripur \nSewage Treatment Plant and a proposed build-operate-own-transfer contract signed by KWSB for industrial \neffluent treatment, and the operation and maintenance of Karachi\u2019s hazardous waste incinerator, which have not \nbeen yet finalized. \n19  ADB. 2003 Country Strategy and Program (2002\u20132006): Pakistan. Manila. \n ", " 4  \ntariff methodology study for improved governance, adapted to local needs and conditions. The \nProject Framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  Sectoral Review and Development of SWM and WSS. Activities will comprise (i) \nmaking  a  comprehensive  analysis  of  practices,  activities,  stakeholders,  and  institutional \nregulatory setup; (ii) verifying data and gap analysis; (iii) developing a methodology for strategic \nplanning  through  consensus;  (iv)  preparing  a  participatory  issue  assessment;  and  (vi) \nformulating SWM and WSS policies for Sindh.  \n \n9.  Strategic Planning. The TA will set the stage for strategic planning in SWM and WSS \nsectors in Sindh over the medium term. Activities will include (i) developing strategic planning \nprinciples and options; (ii) preparing a framework for an efficient and responsive organizational \nstructure, and (iii) formulating strategies and action plans for SWM and WSS in Sindh, based on \nidentified needs of the TMAs. Policies and strategies will provide sectoral overall development \naims and frameworks for action, setting out the main principles surrounding development of \nselected practices. The TA envisages participatory development of policies and strategies at a \nprovincial level, where the TMAs will be instrumental in decision-making. The medium term \nplans for SWM and WSS will be developed for individual TMAs, according to their specific \nneeds and objectives, and collected into a single document for Sindh20. \n \n10.  Stakeholder Participation. To combine professional analysis with local knowledge to \nobtain  outputs  widely  accepted  among  stakeholders,  strategic  planning  will  (i)  identify  key \nstakeholders  and  assess  issues  in  consultation  with  towns  and  talukas,  and  (ii)  conduct \npreliminary technical and organizational workshops to encompass all aspects of SWM and WSS \nand  develop  good  understanding  of  and  agreement  over  outstanding  issues.  Stakeholder \nendorsement of draft SWM and WSS policies, strategies, and action plans will be sought \nfollowing consultation and stakeholder workshops. Schemes for beneficiary communities and \nCBOs will be identified  to encourage participation and ownership throughout planning, design, \nimplementation, and O&M. \n \n11.  Appropriate Tariff Selection. The Government recognizes that a sound tariff policy for \nSWM and WSS is integral to achieving sustainable schemes. A cost-effective and sustainable \nsystem is essential in Sindh, particularly in urban areas facing rapid deterioration of resources, \nyet poverty considerations must be incorporated into the study. Specific activities will include (i) \nstudying existing tariff and user charges, and reviewing data on social and financial objectives, \nbudgetary  constraints,  and  willingness  to  pay;  (ii)  conceptualizing  institutional  and  legal \nframeworks for the tariff approval process and the tariff collection and administration systems in \nrural and urban areas; and (iii) developing a tariff calculation methodology and associated \nguidelines to meet local needs and conditions.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 equivalent, comprising $262,000 in \nforeign exchange costs and $238,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will finance \n$400,000 equivalent, which will cover the entire foreign exchange cost, and $138,000 equivalent \nin local currency costs. The Government will contribute the remaining $100,000, which will \n                                                 \n20  JBIC has recently reported their intention to develop a Master Plan for WSS for Karachi. Subject to confirmation, \nevery effort will be made to coordinate TA activities and prevent any duplication in this city. \n ", "      5\ninclude office accommodation, transportation, counterpart staff, background reports, studies, \nand workshop facilities. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s funding program. \nThe detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The Finance Department of SPG, the Executing Agency for the DSSP, will be the \nExecuting Agency for the TA, while the Local Government Department (LGD) of SPG will be the \nImplementing Agency. The TA activities will be assisted by the DSSP support unit. LGD will \ndesignate a senior staff member to coordinate the TA, and assign counterpart staff to assist the \nconsultants. District governments will select focal points for this TA, coordinating activities with \ntowns and  talukas. These will liaise closely with the consultants and provide regular advice and \ninputs to the TA. Consistent with DSSP activities, the government will set up a TA advisory \ncommittee to periodically review TA progress and guide implementation. The committee will \ncomprise  senior  government  representatives  from  relevant  government  agencies,  including \ndistrict government and TMA officials, LGD, Planning and Development Department of SPG, \nSindh  Environmental  Protection  Agency,  Finance  Department,  Health  Department  of  SPG, \nPublic Health Engineering Department of LGD, and aid agencies. Suitably furnished office \nspace with utilities and telecommunications access, local transport for consultants, maps, data, \nand related documents required by the TA will be provided by LGD.  \n \n14.  The TA will be implemented over 6 months, from February 2005 to July 2005. A team of \ninternational and domestic consultants will be selected and engaged by ADB to provide a total \nof 37 person-months\u2019 consulting services\u201411 person-months\u2019 international and 26 person-\nmonths\u2019 domestic. The consultants will be selected and engaged by ADB in accordance with the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers (2002) \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The \noutline terms of reference for TA consultants and indicative scheduling are in Appendixes 3 and \n4, respectively. The international consultants will include experts in SWM, WSS, and financial \nand economic analysis. The domestic consultants will include experts in SWM, WSS, policies, \ntariff economics, institutional and legal aspects, socioeconomic analysis and environmental \nmanagement. ADB\u2019s simplified technical proposal approach will be used to select consultants.  \n \n15.  The consultants will submit four major reports: (i) an inception report no later than 4 \nweeks after services start; (ii) a midterm report no later than the end of the third month; (iii) a \ndraft final report at the end of the fifth month; and (iv) a final report within 3 weeks upon receipt \nof comments from the Government and ADB on the draft final report. The consultants will \nsubmit short monthly progress reports summarizing project activities, issues, and constraints. \nTripartite meetings will be held among ADB, the Government, and consultants to review the \ninception and draft final reports. Key deliverables from this TA will be translated by consultants \nto facilitate their review by Government and other stakeholders. On approval, SWM and WSS \npolicies, strategies and action plans for Sindh will be disseminated through official publication \nchannels and through print and electronic media. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Pakistan for Capacity Building for Environmental Management in Sindh, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nGoal       \n1.

The  consultants  will  perform  the  following  tasks  in  close  consultation  with  the \nresponsible government departments and agencies at the provincial, district, town and union \ncouncil  levels  to  ensure  full  acceptance  of  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  outcome.  The \nconsultants will undertake the following tasks: \n \nA.  Understanding Shortfalls and Constraints of Solid Waste Management and Water \nSupply and Sanitation in Sindh \n(i)  Review and analyze previous studies at national and provincial level: reports, \ndata, project and related information, including lessons learned from solid waste \nmanagement (SWM) and water supply and sanitation (WSS) projects. \n(ii)  Examine  socioeconomic  data  on  priority  areas  and  assess  the  major  social \nissues  and  constraints.  Review  social  aspects  related  to  SWM  and  WSS, \nincluding patterns of waste generation and handling of households and other \nusers, community-based waste management and participation, and the social \nconditions of waste workers and scavengers. Review the orientation of SWM and \nWSS  services  to  address  the  needs  and  demands  of  population;  public \nawareness  of  solid  waste  and  waterborne  problems  and  priorities;  working \nconditions (safety, sanitation, workload), sanitary and environmental conditions.  \n(iii)  Review studies determining solid waste and sewage quantities and composition \nin rural and urban areas (e.g., generation, transfer, waste disposal). \n(iv)  Determine the budget, scope, and coverage targets of ongoing and planned \nSWM and WSS projects financed by Government and provincial departments, \nvarious agencies and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) (service coverage; \nservice level, effectiveness, and efficiency of waste collection of street sweeping \nand  cleansing  services;  resource  recovery  efficiency  and  targets;  and \neffectiveness and efficiency of water distribution and sanitation system).  \n(v)  Review  solid  waste  and  WSS  operations  and  technologies  in  use  in  Sindh. \nAssess their positive impact on health and environment, capacity, and range of \nusers. \n(vi)  Review data leading to predictions of future capacity requirements and future \ndemand for Sindh SWM and WSS services, to include population predictions, \nsocioeconomic conditions, and projected service coverage.  \n(vii)  Review SWM- and WSS-related legislation and assess enforcement success and \nextent: laws, regulations, standards, and guidelines at the national, provincial, \ndistrict, and local levels. \n(viii)  Review private sector participation in SWM and WSS: type and nature of existing \ninvestments, tendering requirements, contract periods, etc. \n(ix)  Evaluate  to  date  and  ongoing  public  awareness  and  participation  to  include \npractices in supply, storage, and discharge; participation in primary, secondary \nand  tertiary  collection;  willingness  to  pay  fees;  complaints;  fines.  Evaluate \ndecision makers\u2019 awareness of key SWM and WSS issues, political priorities, \nand accountability. \n(x)  Analyze revenue and expenditure of existing SWM and WSS services: budget \nallocation, fee schedules, affordability and value, subsidy schemes, and tariffs. \n(xi)  Analyze existing SWM and WSS administrative support capability with respect to \nplanning, personnel administration, public relations, and health education. \n ", "12  Appendix 3 \n(xii)  Analyze the SWM and WSS sector institutional and organizational setup as well \nas coordination, if any, with local groups (local agencies, CBOs, NGOs, private \nsector, etc). \n(xiii)  Devise  hands-on  assessment  survey  questionnaire,  checklist,  and  any  other \nappropriate method for (a) filling gaps in data collection; and (b) verifying  data \n(willingness to pay surveys, operational setup, realistic data coverage in rural \nareas,  etc.).  Select  representative  sample  areas  and  guide  local  waste \nmanagement and SWM experts in conducting the task.  \n \nB.  Consensus Building  \n(i)  Identify  individuals  to  represent  the  various  stakeholder  groups.  Under  the \ndevolution process in Pakistan, towns and talukas are mandated to undertake \nSWM  and  WSS  design  and  implementation.  Stakeholder  selection  and \nconsultation will therefore ensure their participation. Allow the stakeholders to \nnominate their own representatives, and ensure that all major stakeholder groups \nare represented.  \n(ii)  Develop an issue assessment in consultation with all major stakeholder groups. \nIdentify major sectoral issues: where the stakeholders disagree and where they \nmay be able to find common ground. Explore issues that affect the formulation of \na sector strategy and the development of a project investment, and summarize \nviews in an issue matrix. Define the detailed methodology for the consensus-\nbuilding  efforts.  Circulate  the  draft  issue  assessment  to  all  participants  for \ncomments and translate the final version to be made available to all participants. \n(iii)  Coordinate a consensus group that includes all the stakeholders identified. The \nparticipants, wherever possible, should be high-level staff, capable of making \ncommitments on behalf of their organization. The gender balance of the group \nshould be considered. Establish a schedule and reserve a venue for a series of \nconsensus meetings, preferably in a neutral location. Prepare the agenda for \neach  meeting  to  focus  on  specific  issues,  with  specific  target  outputs.  The \nparticipants for each thematic session may be varied to focus the discussion, but \nthe outputs of each session will be shared with the entire consensus group. \n(iv)  Clearly lay out the ground rules for the process at the beginning of each meeting, \nthe basis for decision making, and the target output. A single text process will be \nused  to  document  the  proceedings.  All  participants  will  be  given  equal \nopportunity and encouragement to participate. All attempts will be made to reach \nconsensus  on  every  important  issue.  The  consultants  will  clearly  document, \nsummarize, and seek agreement on the output of each session. The summary of \nthe output of the meeting will be circulated to the entire group the day after each \nmeeting, and any final comments will be incorporated. \n(v)  Circulate the issue assessment together with draft policy at least 1 week before \nthe first consensus meeting. The issues to be discussed and resolved through \nthe consensus meetings will include (a) a realistic sector strategy and action plan \nfor  WSS  and  SWM  sectors,  based  on  actual  resources  available;  (b)  the \ninstitutional mechanisms most suitable for delivery schemes, clearly defining the \nroles of each stakeholder; (c) a strategy for effectively mobilizing communities, \nwith  focus  on  involving  women;  (d)  optimal  strategy  for  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M), addressing institutional and financial sustainability issues, \nas well as the need for major repairs; (f) sustainable mechanisms for monitoring \nand evaluation. Other factors may also be considered, based on the discussions \nof the group. In developing the solutions, the consultant or facilitator may use \n ", "  Appendix 3  13 \nproblem trees, logical frameworks, or other similar project design tools, to guide \nand focus the process. \n \nC.  Formulation of Provincial Policies, Strategies, and Action Plans for SWM and WSS \n(i)  Based on the review, views collected through a participatory approach, national \npolicies, and operational and institutional objectives for different areas in Sindh, \nidentify  collection  of  overall  objectives  for  SWM  and  WSS  for  Sindh  and \nformulate provincial policies. \n(ii)  Develop SWM and WSS strategies for the different districts in Sindh, assessing \nurban and rural needs and opportunities. The document should be presented as \na comprehensive document for Sindh, but the issues should address separately \nthe perceived needs. Special attention should be paid to the following: \n(a)  Compile  and  present  a  number  of  best-practice  cases,  identify  and \nevaluate appropriate technologies and affordable management options \nfor different scenarios (e.g., different opportunities for domestic, medical, \nindustrial, hazardous waste) for SWM and WSS, considering subsidiarity, \nenvironmental sustainability principles, and access to the poor. Consider \nO&M requirements as part of technology selection, and define carefully \nobjectives for site selection and coverage.  \n(b)  Recommend legal and institutional arrangements for SWM and WSS to \npromote  public  participation.  Review  the  impacts  of  policy \nrecommendations  on  the  poor  and  suggest  most  appropriate  coping \nmechanisms. Consider models for inter- and intra-municipal cooperation. \n(c)  Evaluate  financial  options  for  SWM  and  WSS,  considering  funding \nmodalities, affordability analysis, tariff coverage, waste taxes and disposal \nlevies, charge and rebate system, producer responsibility, subsidies for \nwaste  prevention  and  water  conservation,  tax  preferences,  liability \ninstruments,  cost  effectiveness  parameters  and  principles,  community \ncontribution and participation.  \n(d)  Formulate strategy for public awareness programs for SWM and WSS, \nidentifying  best  communication  means  and  practices.  Assess  health, \nhygiene,  and  sanitation  benefits  and  impact  of  waste  reduction  and \nseparation resulting from greater public awareness. \n(e)  Develop private sector participation options and opportunities for a variety \nof players (CBOs, small contractors, NGOs, suppliers, service contracts, \nmanagement  contracts,  leases,  concessions,  build-operate-transfer,  or \ndivestiture) as a function of size of the activities, presence or absence of \nparticipants, constraints, and local needs. Identify any legal or regulatory \nrestrictions, domestic or foreign, on private participation and suggestions \nfor overcoming. Develop objectives and parameters to promote private \nsector participation and investment.  \n \n(iii)  Develop detailed Sindh action plans for SWM and WSS,1 setting out measures to \nbe taken over the medium term (5\u20137 years). The action plans are to build upon \ndetailed  identification  and  evaluation  options  undertaken  during  review  and \n                                                 \n1  The consultants will undertake extensive consultation exercises throughout the province, in person, through the \nTMA focal point requested in each of the 16 districts, and through the sector experts\u2019 support, engaged in each of \nthe 16 districts\u2019 local support units, as part of DSSP. Consultation will consist of detailed surveys and thematic \nconsultations. The medium-term action plans will set specific options and arrangements needed to pursue the \nstrategy. They will reflect priorities established by the TMAs while receiving technical support from the consultants. \n ", "14  Appendix 3 \nstrategic planning stages and requirements of the agreed-on strategy are to \ninclude but not be limited to the following: \n(a)  Draw up a detailed technical action program including service coverage \nand  site  selection,  detailed  plans  for  SWM  (e.g.,  waste  storage  and \nprimary collection, street sweeping and bulk waste clearance, secondary \ncollection, transfer stations, transport systems, treatment disposal and \nvehicle maintenance) and WSS (e.g., community-operated and -managed \ndug wells and hand pumps; alternative options for addressing arsenic-\ncontaining groundwater sources; rainwater collection units; cost-effective \nwater  treatment  options  on  extraction;  swan-neck  type,  plunge-type \ncommunity toilets in rural areas). \n(b)  Draw  up  an  institution-strengthening  action  program  addressing \nresponsibilities and arrangements for all bodies involved in SWM and \nWSS,  private  sector  involvement,  capacity-building  requirements, \narrangements for licensing, etc.  \n(c)  Evaluate legal and regulatory requirements at various government levels \n(provincial,  town,  taluka,  union  councils);  explore  mechanisms  to \nformalize solid waste segregation and recycling practices; and formulate \nguidelines  for  municipal  waste  management  in  collaboration  with  the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. \n(d)  Assess  the  economics  of  alternative  strategies,  indicative  investment \nplan, indicative recurrent funding plan, sources and uses of funds (cash-\nflow  analysis  during  implementation  and  initial  years  of  operation), \nproposals for physical and financial indicators to measure performances \nduring and after strategy implementation. Assess budgetary requirements \nand financing and cost recovery options for recycling. \n(e)  Propose  a  detailed  public  awareness  and  education  program  and \nimplementation  schedule  to  inform  the  public  of  waste  management \nmethods  and  requirements,  gain  public  support  for  initiatives,  and \nimprove SWM and WSS profile. Design a capacity-building program for \ntowns, talukas, and union councils.  \n \nD.  Objectives and Methodology for SWM Tariff Administration Guidelines \n(i)  Review existing and past tariff structure and tariff user-fee levels for SWM and \nWSS services in various areas, and the system of billing being used. Conduct \nsocial surveys to determine affordability levels and the public\u2019s willingness to pay.  \n(ii)  Review social and financial objectives used to determine solid waste and WSS \ntariffs.  Specifically,  determine  suitable  levels  of  cross-subsidization  between \ncustomers.  \n(iii)  Review  and  present  to  stakeholders  a  number  of  international  best-practice \ncases. Assess, through discussions with stakeholders, the extent to which the \nbilling systems and financial management capabilities of cities may be used for \ncost recovery. \n(iv)  Assess the division of responsibilities among central, provincial, and municipal \ngovernment agencies for funding arrangements, in the preparation and review of \ntariff  setting  proposals,  and  compliance  monitoring.  Consider  budgetary \nconstraints and institutional capacities of agencies involved in the process. \n(v)  Develop social and financial objectives for the agencies and enterprises, NGOs, \nand CBOs responsible for collection and disposal of solid waste and for WSS.  \n ", "  Appendix 3  15 \n(vi)  Based on ADB\u2019s Economics Research Department (ERD) Technical notes 92 and \n10,3 develop methodology and guidelines to set appropriate solid waste and \nWSS  tariffs  and  user  fees,  considering,  among  others,  economic  efficiency, \nfinancial  sustainability,  affordability,  good  governance,  decentralization,  and \nparticipatory mechanisms.
