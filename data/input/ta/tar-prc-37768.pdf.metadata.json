A concept paper on farmers' income and sustainable development was included for \ntechnical assistance (TA) funding under the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund in the Country \nStrategy  and  Program  (CSP)  2004\u20132006  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). A Fact-Finding Mission from ADB visited the PRC from 17 \nMay to 1 June 2004 and formulated the TA. The Mission reached an understanding with the \nGovernment on the TA goal, purpose, scope, implementation arrangements, cost estimates, \nfinancing arrangements, and terms of reference. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  While there has been a significant decline in the overall incidence of income poverty in \nthe PRC in the past 25 years, poverty is still pervasive in the rural areas and addressing it \nremains an unfinished and complex agenda. In 2002, the number of rural poor in absolute \npoverty (annual official poverty line being CNY627 per capita) was 28.2 million, while the \nnumber of those with low income (CNY869 per capita) and are vulnerable to sliding back into \npoverty was 58.3 million. A large number of the poor are found in the western region. In 2002, \nmore than 62% of the absolute poor and 57% of the low-income poor reside in this region. Not \nonly is the poverty situation in the western region more pronounced than that in the eastern and \ncentral regions; income inequality between the rich and poor western provinces has also \nwidened. The worsening regional inequality has contributed in slowing down the pace of poverty \nreduction. A recent study showed that the growth factor as a contributor to reducing poverty in \nthe PRC has become less effective\u2014income in rich and poor provinces are becoming more \nunequal.2 \n3.  Poverty in the western region is not homogeneous as indicated by provincial absolute \npoverty incidence ranging from a low of 3% in Guangxi; to 5-10% in Gansu, Ningxia, Shaanxi, \nXinjiang, and Yunnan, and over 10% in Guizhou, Qinghai, and Tibet. More than one third of the \nabsolute  and  low-income  poor  are  found  in  Guizhou  and  Yunnan  provinces,  which  also \ncomprise the major areas of the Yungui Plateau\u2014the main karst area in the PRC.3 Although the \npopulation in the two provinces depend mainly on agriculture, which contributes a fourth of the \nprovincial gross domestic product, mountains and hills dominate the landscape leaving only 4% \nof the area as arable. Of the predominantly rural population of 131 million, 38% are from \nminority groups. Unlike in the past when the poor were concentrated in large administrative \nblocks like counties, the poor in the western region are more geographically dispersed, are \nlocated in very remote and upland villages, and are characterized by deficient natural and \nhuman resource endowments. More than 66% of the absolute and low-income poor depend on \nagriculture as their main source of income; this is in contrast to higher-income farmers in other \nregions whose income sources are more diversified (44% from farming and the rest from off-\nfarm income).4 Other income features of the absolute and low-income poor are (i) lower yield\u2014\ncereal outputs of the absolute and low-income poor were 216.9 and 223.8 kilograms (kg), \nrespectively, compared with 308.5 kg for higher income farmers; (ii) lower crop stock per capita \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 27 April 2004.  \n2  Using the head count poverty index as a measure of the incidence of poverty, poverty elasticity in 1985\u20131990 was \n\u20130.64; between 1995 and 2000, poverty elasticity was just \u20130.33 (Lin, Wanlong. 2003.  Economic Growth, Income \nInequality, and Poverty Reduction in People\u2019s Republic of China. Asian Development Review. Vol. 20. Manila: \nADB.) \n3  The Yungui Plateau covers the provinces of Guangxi, Guizhou, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, and Yunnan; and the \nmunicipal city of Chongqing. The PRC has the largest karst area in the world. The karst area in Guizhou and \nYunan comprises 33.5% of the Yungui Plateau. Sand and shale are brittle and have weak resistance to \nweathering, often lost layer by layer. Exposed tufts and basalt also have very weak weathering resistance causing \nlandslides and debris.  \n4  Lin  Wanlong.  2004.

Technical Assistance to the People's Republic of China \nfor Institutional Development. Manila. ", "2 \nat the end of the year (405.6 kg and 482.4 kg for absolute and low-income poor versus 600.4 kg \nfor other farmers); and (iii) lower per capita net income of CNY513.0 for the absolute poor and \nCNY813.1 for the low-income poor, contrasted with CNY2,733.9 for higher income farmers.  \n4.  The major causes of poverty are the low output from the poor\u2019s main income source, \nlimited livelihood opportunities, and lack of jobs from the nonfarm sector. Land degradation, \ndesertification, deforestation, improper and unsustainable agriculture practices, and increasing \npopulation have led to widespread soil erosion\u2014resulting in poor crop yields. Low private \ninvestments in forward and backward linkage activities related to the agriculture activities, \nlimited access to market infrastructure and rural finance, and low labor mobility have also \nrestricted the poor's income-generating activities. The remoteness of the poor villages coupled \nwith weak institutions that cannot effectively harness their growth potentials at village levels \nexacerbate the poverty situation. With limited economic activities, local governments in the poor \nvillages and western region in general lack the means to generate revenues, cannot undertake \npoverty reduction initiatives to serve as proactive catalysts of development, and thus help \nperpetuate the vicious circle of poverty.5  \n5.  The Government places emphasis on the development of the western region. The 2002 \nDevelopment Outline of Rural Poverty Reduction of China identified 592 poor counties, many of \nwhich are in the western region. In the 10th National People\u2019s Congress session (March 2004), \nthe Government reaffirmed its commitment to western region development and the need to \nprioritize programs that will increase rural incomes, expand agriculture production, and address \nenvironmental concerns to achieve poverty reduction and sustainable economic development. \nState poverty funds and other government projects for increasing rural incomes have been \nearmarked for development, especially for poor counties in the western region. However, aside \nfrom the problem of targeting (within the poor county, there are non-poor villages), only 10% of \nthe poverty funds reach the target beneficiaries (footnote 4). Realizing the changing nature of \nrural poverty and that its poverty reduction strategy may have become less effective in bridging \nthe gap between the rich and poor provinces, the Government is in search of new approaches \nto increasing rural income and reducing rural poverty. With the assistance of international \nsources of aid, some paradigm shifts are gradually being put in place or tested, such as (i) \nrecognition of the multidimensional feature of poverty, (ii) the need to bring the poor into the \nmainstream of development planning through the participatory process, (iii) the importance of \nvillage  planning,  and  (iv)  the  need  to  redefine  western  regional  development  in  terms  of \naddressing environmental problems and encouraging business investment. The Government \nnotes, however, that provinces in the western region will still need external support since (i) the \nregion is still particularly poor, (ii) poverty in the region is closely linked with the poor natural \nresource base for agricultural development and complex environmental concerns, and (iii) the \nregion remains unattractive for private sector development.6 \n6.  In  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  emphasis  on  increasing  income  and  reducing  rural \npoverty, ADB\u2019s CSP for 2004\u20132006 has identified four focal strategies: (i) promotion of equitable \nand inclusive growth, particularly in inland western and central provinces; (ii) development of \nmore  efficient  and  effective  markets;  (iii)  regional  cooperation;  and  (iv)  promotion  of \nenvironmental protection and management. Several lending and nonlending investments have \nbeen earmarked for the western region, especially to ensure pro-poor growth in poverty areas.7 \nInternational aid support has also moved toward assisting the poor western region. In 1995 to \n2001, the World Bank implemented the China Southwest Poverty Reduction Project (SWPRP) \n                                                 \n5  An ADB study identified key policy and institution-related challenges to cash-strapped local governments in \n  undertaking effective and efficient poverty reduction activities (ADB. 2003.

The  International  Foundation  of \nAgriculture Development has provided loan support to poor farmers in 18 provinces and more \nthan 140 counties in the region. The Department for International Development has targeted \nsustainable livelihood, environmental management, education, and health projects in Gansu, \nSichuan, and Yunnan. Other agencies8 have likewise provided grants for poverty reduction \ndemonstration  projects  and  strengthening  development  partner  cooperation.  Major  lessons \nlearned from these experiences especially from the SWPRP,9 from which this TA will build on \nand  will  pilot-test  in  Guizhou  and  Yunnan  follow:  (i)  community-driven  and  participatory \ninitiatives are appropriate and sustainable approaches for increasing rural income and reducing \nabsolute and low-income poverty in geographically dispersed, remotely located, and resource-\nconstrained poor areas\u2014the idea is to harness the growth potential of poor villages; (ii) village \nplanning based on a comprehensive and participatory analysis of the economic, social, and \npolitical context should take into consideration natural and human resource endowments of the \npoor and non-poor, women and men, and the local knowledge of minority groups; (iii) the poor \nin  the  village  must  be  provided  with  a  menu  of  sustainable  alternative  rural  livelihood \nopportunities that are  based on market and institutional analysis, and build on the forward, \nbackward, and horizontal linkage activities at the village level; (iv)  alternative rural livelihood \nactivities at the village level must develop  community-based organizations (CBOs) encourage \neffective mechanisms for delivering services from local and national governments, and provide \nan enabling policy environment; (v) least-cost and community-based monitoring and evaluation \n(M&E), and feedback mechanisms must be established during the planning phase; and (vi) \ninstitution building and coordination among agencies and within individual agencies responsible \nfor poverty reduction, agriculture and rural development, and environmental management are \nrequired.10   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n7.  The goal of the TA is to increase rural income in poor villages of Guizhou and Yunnan. \nIts purpose is to demonstrate sustainable alternative rural livelihood measures in a participatory \nmanner for those poor villages. Its outputs are (i) participatory action plans at the village level, \n(ii) pilots of key sustainable alternative rural livelihood projects, (iii) policy reforms on local and \nnational policies that directly impact on sustainable alternative rural livelihoods, (iv) capacity \ndevelopment and awareness program, and (v) community-based M&E system. A summary \ninitial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  With  the  use  of  participatory  quantitative  and  qualitative  approaches  in  phase  1, \nparticipating villages11 will be comprehensively assessed in terms of livelihoods, assets, and \nagro-ecological conditions. Geographic information system (GIS) maps will be produced as part \nof  the  inputs  to  the  assessments  to  show  the  poverty,  agro-ecological environment, and \nlivelihood and asset landscapes. A typology of diverse socio-agro-ecological conditions and \n                                                 \n8 These include the Food and Agriculture Organization, United Nations and Development Programme, and World \nFood Programme. \n9  Supplementary Appendix A. \n10 For example, divisions within the Ministry of Agriculture should have a venue to discuss each division\u2019s programs \nand policies (related to poverty reduction, agriculture and rural development, and environmental management) and \nbenefit from synergies among these and at the same time avoid conflicts and duplication. \n11  Low-income villages with a high number of core poor and have already undertaken the government\u2019s participatory \nplanning methodology will be selected. To the extent possible, villages receiving external assistance similar to TA \nactivities will not be selected. Where there is external assistance not directly related to TA activities, mechanisms \nfor complementation will be explored. Other criteria such as the presence of minority groups, and representative \nfeatures of the village for possible scaling up of good practices emanating from the TA will be taken into account \nand discussed during the inception of TA implementation. ", "4 \npoverty groupings, which are sensitive to gender and minority groups\u2019 concerns, and livelihood \nstrategies will be developed in participatory assessments. Institutional and policy evaluations \nthat directly impact on farmers\u2019 income, rural poverty, and sustainable development will likewise \nbe undertaken.  \n9.  Following the assessments, village stakeholders will develop sustainable alternative \nrural livelihood action plans, which will include a sustainable alternative rural livelihood matrix \nand investment requirements, funding methods, capacity-building requirements, and policy and \ninstitutional requirements. The plan will serve as the basis for phase 2, which include pilot \ntesting and demonstration of sustainable alternative rural livelihood projects in the villages. \nSome of the projects12 will be funded under the TA through mechanisms such as microfinance \nactivities  administered  by  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs).  The  M&E  and  feedback \nmechanisms will also be put in place. \n10.  From the policy and institutional assessments, a policy and institutional strengthening \nagenda will be developed and selected for TA implementation. About 6 policy studies (4 local-\nlevel  and  2  national),13  10  training  programs,  and  4  public  awareness  programs  will  be \nundertaken. Before the end of the TA, an exit strategy will be developed in consultation with \nvillage stakeholders. Lessons and experiences will be evaluated, and recommendations made \nto the Government for scaling up or adapting successful TA experiences at the provincial level, \nYungui  Plateau,  or  the  karst  area  for  dissemination.  The  Government  has  expressed  its \ncommitment to scaleup successful experiences that will ensure sustainable rural income in poor \nvillages.  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,125,000 equivalent, comprising $268,000 in \nforeign exchange and $857,000 equivalent in local currency. ADB will administer the TA, which \nwill finance $900,000 equivalent comprising the entire foreign exchange cost and $632,000 \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty \nReduction Cooperation Fund. The Government, through the provision of office accommodation \nand transport, remuneration and per diem of counterpart staff, and participation in project \nmanagement will finance in kind the remaining portion of the local currency costs equivalent to \n$225,000. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA). MOA will \nserve as the overall coordinator of the TA. It will liaise with ADB on TA-related matters; establish \nproject coordination functions in two provinces; provide regular feedback on the status and \nprogress of the TA to the steering committee;14 and advocate good practices, lessons learned, \nand policy and institutional reforms gained from the TA. MOA will appoint a senior staff member \nas full-time project director to serve as the focal point for the TA. Through the project director, \nMOA will establish project coordination units (PCUs) at the provincial level to be housed at the \nDepartment of International Cooperation of the provinces\u2019 Department of Agriculture (DOA). \nEach provincial PCU will develop advisory teams.15 The PCUs will coordinate and oversee TA \n                                                 \n12  Alternative livelihood projects can include processing of agricultural products, handicrafts for the tourism industry, \nand small-scale infrastructure for improving agricultural productivity such as water storage systems or improving \nenvironmental quality such as biogas applications. \n13 Examples of policy issues are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n14 The steering committee comprising directors of key departments in MOA and the Ministry of Finance will provide \noverall policy guidance in TA implementation; address coordination problems among departments in MOA and \nother ministries to improve delivery of related services; and provide mechanisms for advocating policy and \ninstitutional recommendations, and scaling up successful experiences to other low-income western provinces. \n15  The advisory team will comprise, on a needs basis, representatives from key departments of DOA; the Poverty \nAlleviation Office; the Environmental Protection Bureau; and farmers, women, and minority groups. PCUs will \ninitiate regular meetings with the advisory teams to update and discuss the progress of TA implementation at the \nvillage level, and provide quick resolutions that will improve their delivery of services to the village. ", "    5 \nactivities,  advocate  policy  and  institutional  recommendations,  and  disseminate  information.  \nPCUs will also provide logistical support to experts engaged, including adequately furnished \noffice space and access to communication facilities. ADB will field TA review missions to review \nand discuss the overall progress of implementation. \n \n13.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months and is anticipated to begin in November \n2004 and to be completed by December 2006. In phase 1, the first 8 months will be devoted to \nassessment and survey work, and the succeeding 2 months to action planning activities. The \nrest of the 14 months (phase 2) will be used for pilot-testing sustainable alternative rural \nlivelihood activities, capacity building and institutional strengthening, policy studies, advocacy, \nand public awareness programs.  \n \n14.  A team composed of an international consultant and domestic consultants will implement \nthe TA. Implementation will require 4 person-months of international and 44 person-months of \ndomestic  consultants  with  core  expertise  in  rural  development,  sustainable  livelihood, \ndevelopment economics, social development, agro-ecology, institutional strengthening, public \npolicy, and capacity  building  and  training.  An  unallocated  18  person-months of consulting \nservices will accommodate extension of experts for phase 2 and recruitment of experts (such as \ntechnical specialists in pilot projects to be undertaken) identified during the course of the \nassessment and planning. Details will be decided before the end of phase 1. Consultants will be \nrecruited  through  a  domestic  firm  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants using the quality- and cost-based selection method and full technical proposals. \nThe domestic firm will be engaged initially for phase 1. The requirement to engage the same \nfirm for phase 2 for continued progress of the achievements of phase 1 will be determined \ntoward  the  end  of  phase  1.  The  rural  development  specialist  and  sustainable  livelihood \nspecialist will act as team leader and deputy team leader, respectively. The team leader must \nhave  experience  in  undertaking  participatory  rapid  appraisal  and  other  community-based \nplanning and problem solving based on participatory methodologies. Integral to the assessment \nin the first phase will be GIS mapping. Because of its comparative advantage in this area, the \nChina Agriculture University (CAU) will be subcontracted to provide the GIS mapping inputs.16 \nPilot projects, policy studies, and training and coordination programs will be designed in phase 1 \nand will be subcontracted to domestic experts, academic institutions, or NGOs during phase 2. \nEquipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.  \n \n15.  The consultants will produce (i) an inception report, (ii) a midterm report, (iii) a draft final \nreport, and (iv) a final report. Each quarter, consultants will submit a progress report describing \nprogress to date against an agreed upon work timetable, problems encountered and action \ntaken, and anticipated problems or delays in the conduct of the TA. The outline terms of \nreference is in Appendix 4.17  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $900,000 to the Government \nof the People\u2019s Republic of China to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction \nCooperation Fund for the  Rural Income and Sustainable Development Project, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n16 Discussions have been held with the CAU for access to existing GIS systems and facilities for the TA. This will \nlower the cost of GIS mapping to the TA, resulting in large benefits in terms of livelihood assessment at a small \nincremental cost. Cofinancing options are also being explored. \n17 Indicative staffing and implementation schedules are given in Supplementary Appendixes B and C, respectively.

Yes  poverty partnership agreement?  Yes \n \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in the People's Republic of China (PRC): \n \nAddressing poverty through agricultural development and sustainable management of natural resources is a priority \nconcern in the western region where rural poverty persists. The Government places emphasis on the development of \nthe western region, particularly on issues related to increasing rural incomes, expanding agriculture production, and \naddressing environmental concerns. It also stresses the need to increase stakeholder participation in policymaking \nand governance. The sector can contribute substantially to poverty reduction provided that sustainable alternative \nrural livelihood assessments and participatory action plans lead to the demonstration of sustainable alternative rural \nlivelihood projects, policy studies lead to policy reforms on local and national policy that directly impact sustainable \nalternative rural livelihoods, and capacity building and awareness lead  to a strategy for scaling up sustainable \nalternative rural livelihood at provincial levels. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Proposed Poverty Classification:1 Poverty Intervention  \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nThe overall incidence of income poverty has significantly declined in the People's Republic of China (PRC) in the past \n25 years. The downward trend was the overall pattern regardless of what poverty line is used. Based on the PRC\u2019s \nofficial poverty line of CNY625 per person per annum, the number of the rural poor (often referred to as the absolute \npoor) declined from 250 million in 1978 to 28.2 million by 2002. It should be noted that, for the first time since 1990, \nthe number of those in absolute poverty rose to 29.0 million from 2002 to 2003. The proportion of the absolute poor to \ntotal rural population fell from 30.7% in 1978 to less than 3% in 2003. Assuming the Government\u2019s low income \ndefinition of CNY869 per capita per annum (which is almost equivalent to an income-based poverty line of $1 per \nperson a day), the number of the rural poor has gone down from about 250 million in 1990 to 86.5 million in 2002. If \nthe poverty threshold is the consumption-based $1 a day, the number of the poor would be about 300 million in 1988 \ndeclining to 161 million in 2002. Yet poverty remains pervasive in the rural areas and addressing it remains an \nunfinished and complex agenda. \n \nThe western region of the PRC experienced the highest levels of poverty. The proportion of the absolute poor \npopulation in the western rural region increased from 51% in 1993 to 61% in 2000. In contrast, poverty declined in the \neastern and central regions from 10% and 39%, respectively, in 1993 to 25% and 34%, respectively in 2000. In 2002, \npoverty incidence was 10.6%  in Guizhou and 8.7% in Yunnan, using the official poverty line of CNY627 per capita per \nyear. The two provinces are home to 37% of the western region\u2019s poor. There is a large proportion of those with low \nincome in the two provinces (those above the poverty line but with incomes less than CNY869 per capita per year). \nThe  vulnerable  low-income  population  in  the  two  provinces  constitute  17.4%  and  16.7%  of  the  population, \nrespectively. An estimated 34% of the western region\u2019s low-income population reside in the two provinces. Of 592 \nGovernment-identified poverty-stricken counties, eligible for state support, the largest number is in Yunnan (72) \nfollowed by Guizhou (50). Poverty analysis using quantitative and qualitative sustainable livelihood assessments will \nbe undertaken during implementation of the technical assistance (TA).  \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?  Yes  \n \nStakeholders include rural residents at the village level, village-level community-based organizations (CBOs), farmers\u2019, \nwomen\u2019s, minority, youth, and other groups; village, township, county, and province local governments; local-level \ngovernment  agencies  including  relevant  divisions  of  the  Poverty  Alleviation  Office,  Department  of  Agriculture, \nEnvironmental Protection Bureau, and other agencies; local and national policymakers; nongovernment organizations; \nMinistry of Agriculture; and the Ministry of Finance. Roles, responsibilities, and interests will be examined in detail \nduring TA implementation.  \n                                                 \n1  Following the Board approval of the R-paper, Review of ADB's Poverty Reduction Strategy, staff instructions to \n  replace the PI/CPI classification with a new tracking system are under preparation, in line with para. 83 of the R-\n  paper. \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \nduring TA implementation.  \nIs there a participation strategy?
