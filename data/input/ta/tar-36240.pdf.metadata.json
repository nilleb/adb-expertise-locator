Mongolia\u2019s population centers are connected by very poor roads, the result of extreme \nseasonal  weather  patterns,  difficult  terrain,  low  population  densities,  and  limited  financial \nresources. Ground travel from provincial centers to the capitol can take up to a week, and in \nwinter can be virtually impossible. In these conditions civil aviation should play a vital role in \neconomic  growth  by  providing  fast,  reliable  connections  between  population  centers  for \nGovernment, business, tourism, and ordinary citizens.  \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has a long history of involvement in civil aviation in \nMongolia. In 1993, ADB provided a loan to rehabilitate Ulaanbaatar\u2019s international airport1 and a \ntechnical assistance (TA) grant to help establish the Mongolia Civil Aviation Authority (MCAA) \nas a separate entity from the national airline, the Mongolia Civil Air Transport Company (MIAT), \noperating under the Ministry of Infrastructure. ADB provided a second loan in 1995 to establish \nan air navigation system that would permit international overflights, and additional TA to (i) \nfinalize  MCAA\u2019s  accounting  systems,  (ii)  provide  legal  advice  on  bilateral  agreements  for \noverflights, and (iii) provide further human resource development.2 All of these projects have \nbeen evaluated as successful, with MCAA now well established, Ulaanbaatar airport managing \nincreasing passenger loads, and international overflights generating substantial revenues for the \ncentral budget.  \n \n3.  Despite the positive impact of these activities, the role of civil aviation in the overall \neconomy remains limited. The sector is dominated by the state, which owns and manages \nnearly all civil aviation assets and services but does not have the resources for strategic \ndevelopment. In January 2001, the Government issued Privatization Guidelines for 2001-2004, \nwhich spells out the objectives, general principles, methods, and legal framework for a new \nprivatization  program  to  divest  of  valuable  assets,  including  MIAT.  MCAA  subsequently \norganized an aid agency roundtable to discuss MIAT\u2019s privatization in the context of the overall \ndevelopment of civil aviation. Further discussions between aid agencies and the Government \nled to a consensus that, prior to MIAT privatization, the Government needed to (i) develop a \nforward-looking policy and regulatory framework for civil aviation that facilitates private sector \nparticipation, (ii) prepare a priority investment plan identifying specific areas for public and  \nprivate investment,  and (iii) overhaul MIAT operations and management. The Government \nrequested  ADB  TA  on  the  policy  and  regulatory  side,  while  the  European  Bank  for \nReconstruction and Development agreed to finance the investment study and a management \ncontract for MIAT. The Country Programming Mission and the Country Strategy and Program \nUpdate  confirm  that  the  TA  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  goal  of  promoting  private  sector \ndevelopment  as  the  key  to  economic  growth  in  an  environment  marked  by  persistent \nunemployment, slow growth, and poverty.  The TA Framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1993.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to \nMongolia  for  the  National  Air  Navigation  Development  Project  and  Technical  Assistance  to  Mongolia  for \nInstitutional Strengthening of the Civil Aviation Sector. Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet version) on 25 June 2002. ", "2   \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Mongolia has traditionally relied on mineral resources, cashmere, and other animal \nproducts for economic growth. Overall growth plummeted during a decade of painful economic \ntransition as financial support from the former Soviet Union was withdrawn. Commodity exports \nalso remain vulnerable to domestic shocks, as amply illustrated by recent droughts and severe \nwinters, and to exogenous shocks, including the Asian economic crisis and the 2001 terrorist \nattacks\u2013both  of  which  had  a  negative  impact  on  prices  for  copper  and  cashmere,  two  of \nMongolia\u2019s most important exports. With its vast natural beauty and political stability, tourism \noffers an encouraging prospect for economic diversification. Tourism arrivals are increasing \nrapidly despite the events of 11 September 2001, and are projected to increase steadily for the \nforeseeable future. Long-term growth depends on the availability of reliable safe domestic air \ntransport. Apart from tourism, air transport also plays an important domestic socioeconomic \nfunction in Mongolia. Although ADB is investing in the improvement of a north-south road \ncorridor,  for  most  of  Mongolia  the  cost  of  developing  and  maintaining  a  surface  transport \nnetwork is prohibitive, and air transport offers the best and sometimes only quick link between \nrural areas and Ulaanbaatar. \n \n5.  As demand for air transport increases in Mongolia, so too does the burden on MCAA \nand the Government to service the sector. But with the economy still in transition and recovering \nfrom economic shocks, the Government does not have the resources to shoulder this burden \nalone. Although overflights now generate substantial revenues, to date the mechanism for \nchanneling a portion of these funds back into civil aviation development has not been clearly \ndefined, and revenues are often channeled to other sectors depending on short-term budget \nrequirements. Lack of investment in the air transport sector poses a constraint to tourism \ndevelopment, with limited domestic and international air transport options and flight schedules, \npublic perception of poor air safety, and an underdeveloped domestic airport system. Apart from \na few small charter operators, most domestic routes and travelers are served by MIAT\u2019s aging \nfleet of Antonov-24 and Antonov-26 airplanes, which must be retired by 2005. MIAT does not \nhave the financial capacity to replace the domestic fleet, partly because it is forced to serve low-\nvolume routes and operate all routes at a loss due to restrictions on tariffs. All but four domestic \nairports have limited passenger handling capacity, feature gravel or grass airstrips without \nlighting systems, and have primitive air traffic services.  \n \n6.  The future of MIAT is inextricably linked with more general issues in civil aviation, \nincluding competition policy and the entrance of private operators, tariffs and subsidy policy, \nbasic social requirements to serve remote provinces, domestic airport infrastructure, domestic \nair  navigation/air  traffic  services  infrastructure,  and  sources  of  financing  for  development \nincluding  use  of  overflight  revenues.  In  all  of  these  areas  there  is  scope  for  clarifying  or \ndeveloping government policies. Although MCAA has developed a set of investment priorities \nfor civil aviation, these do not derive from a comprehensive strategy for the sector based on \ncareful demand, financial, and economic analyses. Until the Government formulates a clear \nlong-term vision for the sector and enunciates a strategy for its development, including the \npotential role of the private sector in financing, managing, or owning air transport assets, it will \nbe difficult to attract investment in civil aviation, either for MIAT, for new air transport providers, \nor for infrastructure.  \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n7.   The overall sector goal is the development of civil aviation in Mongolia as a catalyst for \neconomic growth through greater private sector participation. The immediate objective of this \nadvisory TA is to assist the Government to develop a long-term vision for the sector and its role \nin the economy, and forward-looking aviation sector policies and a regulatory framework that will \nsupport private sector participation in the future in air transport services and infrastructure. Key \noutputs will include (i) assessment of the potential for private participation in civil aviation, \nincluding air transport, air traffic services, ground handling, airports and other infrastructure; (ii) \ndraft policy for the development of, and private sector participation in, civil aviation; (iii) strategic \nreform plan for addressing constraints to sector development, including capacity building, legal \nand regulatory reform, tariff and subsidy policy, and competition policy; and (iv) a series of \nworkshops to discuss project findings and proposals and to refine the draft policy and strategic \nplan.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n8.  Part  A\u2013Industry  Analysis.  Under  this  component,  the  TA  will  assess  the  market \ndemand for domestic air transport and the cost structure between Ulaanbaatar and regional \nairports to estimate the sustainable size of the domestic air transport industry over a 10-year \nplanning horizon and the potential for additional private operators. On this basis the TA will \nassist MCAA to develop scenarios for the evolution of the domestic and international fleet and \nroute network. Similar analysis will be completed for international flights to and from Mongolia.  \n \n9.  Part  B\u2013Aviation  Infrastructure  and  Services.  This  component  will  (i)  assess  the \neconomic potential for private participation in the operation of air navigation and air traffic \nservices,  and  in  domestic  airfield  services  such  as  fueling,  aircraft  maintenance,  ground \nhandling, and ticketing services; (ii) review existing regulatory and safety requirements (which \nwere developed specifically to facilitate MIAT operations) for their suitability for private entrants; \n(iii)  assess  MCAA\u2019s  role  and  capacity  for  regulating  private  operators;  (iv)  identify  legal \nconstraints to foreign and domestic investment in the sector; (v) develop draft policies for the \nplanning, financing, operation, management, and ownership of infrastructure and services that \nspell out the appropriate role of Government and the private sector;  and (vi) develop a strategic \nplan for addressing regulatory, legal, and other constraints. \n \n10.  Part C\u2013Air Transport. This component will identify constraints to private participation in \ndomestic air transport, including the legal and regulatory environment, tariff and subsidy policy, \nneed for and potential structure of an independent economic regulatory body, social objectives, \nand minimum service requirements for domestic routes. MCAA\u2019s role and capacity to ensure \nsafety  and  provide  oversight  will  be  reviewed,  and  on  the  basis  of  this  review  specific \nrecommendations on capacity building and human resource development will be prepared. On \nthe international side, the TA will (i) evaluate the potential for expanding scheduled and charter \npassenger and freight services to and from Mongolia; (ii) review the potential impact of existing \npolicies on competition, tariffs, and capacity entitlements; and (iii) advise the Government on \nbilateral  issues  such  as  fifth  freedom  rights,4  and  open  sky  agreements.  The  analyses \nconducted in Parts A through C will form the basis of draft policies to govern the development of \n                                                 \n4  Fifth freedom rights refers to the right of an airline of one country to carry traffic between two other countries \nproviding the flight originates or terminates in its own country. ", "4   \ndomestic  and  international  air  transport  and  services,  and  a  strategic  plan  for  addressing \nregulatory, legal, human, and financial resource constraints.  \n  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $353,000 equivalent, of which $267,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $86,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. The Government has \nrequested the Bank to finance $300,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost \nand $33,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant \nbasis from ADB's TA funding program. The Government will finance the balance of the local \ncurrency cost of $53,000 equivalent through provision of office space and support, information, \ndata, security,  counterpart staff salaries, and contingencies. The cost estimates and financing \nplan are included in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  MCAA will be the Executing Agency for the TA, and the director, Policy and Foreign \nRelations  Department  will  serve  as  the  project  director,  overseeing  all  aspects  of \nimplementation. MCAA will lead the policy development process by serving as the focal point for \nall stakeholders with responsibility for disseminating draft policy documents, hosting public \nhearings, and finalizing the civil aviation policy and development strategy. Key stakeholders \ninclude the State Property Committee, Ministry of Infrastructure, consumer groups, potential \ninvestors, private air transport operators, and  state employees in the sector. TA activities will \nneed  to  be  coordinated  closely  with  parallel  activities  financed  by  the  European  Bank  for \nReconstruction and Development. The TA will be implemented over a period of about 7 months, \nfrom November 2002 to May 2003. \n \n13.  The TA will require the services of international and domestic experts (for a total of 10 \nmonths and 8 months, respectively) in the fields of civil aviation policy, civil aviation legal and \nregulatory  arrangements,  air  transport  economics,  private  sector  development,  and \ninfrastructure development. The team of consultants, from an international consulting firm in \nassociation with domestic consultants, will be engaged using ADB\u2019s quality and cost-based \nselection procedures and according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The outline \nterms of reference are included in Appendix 3. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n14.

The overall purpose of the technical assistance (TA) is to assist the Government to \ndevelop a forward-looking policy environment to support the growth, sophistication, and safety \nof civil aviation in Mongolia so that the sector may better serve the social and economic needs \nof the economy. Such a policy needs to address (i) constraints to sector development; (ii) \neconomic and regulatory arrangements; (iii) division of regulatory and provider roles; and (iv) \nownership  and  management  structures,  including  corporatization,  commercialization,  and \neventual privatization where appropriate for domestic and international air carriers, airports, \ndomestic air traffic services, aviation support services such as maintenance, ground handling \nservices, catering, and training for pilots, cabin crew, maintenance engineering staff, and other \naviation personnel.  \n \n2.  In  each  set  of  tasks  described  here,  the  TA  will  consider  the  appropriate  roles  of \ngovernment  agencies  such  as  the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  (MOI),  Mongolia  Civil  Aviation \nAuthority (MCAA), Parliament, Ministry of Industry and Trade, and other bodies in the technical \nand economic regulation of the sector. \n \n3.  The TA will require 10 person-months of international consultants and 8 person-months \nof domestic consultants, working as a team over a period of roughly 7 months. The team will \nconsist of the following: (i) civil aviation policy specialist/team leader (international, 5 person-\nmonths); (ii) air transport economist (international, 2 person-months); (iii) civil aviation legal and \nregulatory expert (international, 2 person-months); (iv) private sector development specialist \n(international, 1 person-month); (v) air transport specialist (domestic, 4 person-months); and (vi) \ninfrastructure specialist (domestic, 4 person-months). The team will work together, under the \nguidance of the team leader and the supervision of MCAA and MOI, to complete the tasks \ndescribed here. \n \nA.  Part A\u2013Industry Analysis \n4.  Policy development for the aviation sector first requires a general understanding of \npassenger and freight demand within Mongolia and between Mongolia and other countries, and \nhow this demand is expected to evolve over time. The consultants will assist MCAA to do the \nfollowing: \n \n(i)  Make general aviation sector projections through estimates of market demand for \ndomestic  air  transport  (passenger  and  freight)  and  cost  structure  between \nUlaanbaatar and existing airports over a 10-year planning horizon, and price and \nincome elasticity of demand for national and international passengers. Identify \npotentially profitable domestic routes.  Where possible use disaggregated (by \ntype of passenger, such as tourism, business, personal, Government) and pair-\nwise demand models, and the findings of existing tourism studies and plans. \n \n(ii)  On the basis of (i), estimate the sustainable size of the domestic air transport \nindustry over the planning horizon and potential for additional private operators. \n \n(iii)  Develop scenarios for the future evolution of the domestic fleet, route network, \nand size of the industry, unconstrained by airport characteristics. \n \n ", "8  Appendix 3 \n(iv)  Analyze each scenario against agreed upon policy objectives and development \ncriteria, and develop a recommended strategic approach. \n \nB.  Part B\u2013Aviation Infrastructure and Services \n5.  MCAA has drafted a preliminary plan for upgrading seven domestic airfields with hard \nsurface  and  lighting,  and  will  be  developing  with  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and \nDevelopment (EBRD) assistance a long-term investment plan for domestic airports. Future \ninvestments, including selection of priority airports, should be driven by an overall policy for the \nsector  that  spells  out  needs  based  on  sound  demand  forecasts  and  achievable  industry \nstructure (including an economically sound airline fleet structure), and identifies sources of \nfinancing. Although currently these assets are owned and maintained by the Government, future \ndevelopment  may  be  of  interest  to  the  private  sector,  particularly  for  the  higher  volume \ndestinations. As an intermediate step, it might make sense to corporatize some assets such as \nairports. The main task of the consultants is to assess the potential for and constraints to private \nsector participation in the maintenance, development, operation, and partial or full ownership of \ndomestic airports and airfields as part of an overall policy for the development of domestic \naviation infrastructure and services. Specifically the consultants will assist the Government in \ndoing the following: \n \n(i)  Based  on  recent  passenger  statistics  and  demand  forecasts,  the  above \ndeveloped sector strategy, as well as the priority investment list for domestic \nairports developed under the forthcoming EBRD study, identify candidate airports \nwith the potential to attract private investors in operations. Based on existing \nairport runway infrastructure make recommendations on appropriate aircraft and \nanalyze costs and benefits of upgrading to surfaced runways to accommodate \ndifferent types of aircraft. \n \n(ii)  In conjunction with proposed reforms of Mongolia Civil Air Transport Company \n(MIAT) and unbundling of some of its ground services, assess the economic \npotential for private participation in the operation of domestic airfield services \nsuch as fueling, aircraft maintenance, ground handling, ticketing services, and \ncatering at individual airports or through concessions for groups of airports.  \n \n(iii)  Assess the economic potential for private investment to upgrade airport and \nairfield facilities, including air navigation and air traffic services, through joint \npublic-private  ventures,  build-operate-transfer  arrangements,  and  other \nmechanisms, either for individual airports or through concessions for groups of \nairports. Assess the potential for domestic and international airline operators to \ninvest in ground services. \n \n(iv)  Assess the potential for and desirability of devolution of MCAA management of \nairports to provincial governments. \n \n(v)  Review various financial mechanisms for private sector participation in domestic \nairports and services\u2013ranging from contracting out management, to leasing or \noutright private ownership\u2013commenting on the advantages and disadvantages of \neach, and their suitability in the Mongolian context.  Investigate the desirability of \ncorporatizing the management of airports and services as an intervening step \ntoward private participation. ", "  Appendix 3  9 \n(vi)  As  most  regulatory  measures  were  developed  specifically  to  facilitate  MIAT \noperations,  review  the  suitability  of  regulatory/safety  requirements  for  private \nparticipation in airports and airfield services, and MCAA\u2019s role and capacity for \nregulating private operators in these areas.  \n \n(vii)  In conjunction with (iv) and (v), review the current legal and regulatory framework \nfor foreign and domestic investment and its suitability for private investment in \nand/or operation of domestic air transport assets and services. \n \n(viii)  On the basis of (i) through (vi), draft a policy on the development of domestic \nairports, other aviation infrastructure, and services that spells out the approach to \nplanning,  development,  financing,  operation,  and  ownership;  identifies  the \nappropriate  role  of  the  Government  and  the  private  sector;  and  includes  a \nstrategic plan for addressing regulatory, legal, and other constraints. \n \nC.  Part C\u2013Air Transport  \n6.  Currently the vast majority of domestic air passengers and (limited) freight are carried by \nMIAT. Whether MIAT is sold in the future \u201cas is\u201d or first split between domestic and international \noperations, the Government needs to outline its development goals for domestic air transport \nand clarify a number of issues that will determine future private interest and investment in the \nsector.  On  the  international  front,  MCAA  needs  advice  on  competition  policy,  bilateral \nagreements, and policies to promote air freight consolidation and transshipment. To assist in the \nformation of a policy on domestic and international air transport development, the consultants \nwill assist MCAA in doing the following: \n \n(i)  On  the  basis  of  the  industry  analysis,  estimate  the  sustainable  size  of  the \ndomestic air transport industry over the planning horizon and the potential for \nadditional private operators. \n(ii)  Review  with  the  Government  its  social  objectives  in  civil  aviation,  and  the \nminimum service requirements on all domestic routes based on these objectives. \n(iii)  Review the tariff policy for domestic routes and the constraints of same to private \noperation of domestic air transport; make recommendations on an appropriate \ntariff policy that will encourage private operators while meeting social objectives. \n(iv)  Assess the legal and regulatory environment for foreign and domestic private \nprovision of air transport on domestic routes, and the constraints such as import \napprovals required for new aircraft, taxes and duties on aircraft, and taxes on \nfuel;  suggest  necessary  reforms  or  clarifications  of  the  legal  and  regulatory \nenvironment. \n(v)  Assess the safety and oversight requirements for increased private participation \nin  air  transport,  MCAA\u2019s  capacity  to  meet  these  requirements,  and  human \nresource development needs. \n(vi)  Evaluate various mechanisms for attracting domestic or foreign investors in air \ntransport to provide domestic scheduled or charter services, for example through \nthe  franchising  of  routes  or  packages  of  routes,  with  minimum  service \nrequirements specified, and the possibility of negative bids for unprofitable routes \nand cross-subsidies from profitable routes. \n(vii)  Identify alternative financing mechanisms to subsidize unprofitable routes, for \nexample through an aviation fund that comprises a share of fees from private \noperators, contributions from overflight revenue, and direct budget transfers. \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \n(viii)  Evaluate the potential for the expansion of international scheduled and short- and \nlong-haul charter services to and from Mongolia; the viability of the entrance of \nother  international  carriers;  and  existing  policies  on  competition,  tariffs,  and \ncapacity entitlements. \n(ix)  Advise MCAA on policy and strategy for international bilateral negotiations, such \nas maximization of the value of fifth freedom rights, and appropriateness of open \nsky  agreements,  and  the  potential  for  transshipment  arrangements  using \nUlaanbaatar as a transport/storage hub. \n(x)  Evaluate the potential for increasing international air freight consolidation and \ntransshipment and the constraints thereto. \n(xi)  On the basis of (i)\u2013(vii), draft a policy on the development of domestic and \ninternational air transport that spells out, inter alia,  the approach to tariff policy, \nsocial  objectives  and  minimum  service  requirements,  competition  policy  and \nmethod  of  entry  for  private  operators,  safety,  and  oversight,  and  includes  a \nstrategic plan for addressing regulatory, legal, and other constraints. \n \nD.
