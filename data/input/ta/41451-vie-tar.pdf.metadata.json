INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Viet Nam has requested technical assistance (TA) to support reform \nof its civil service administration. Assistance in this area is considered to be most effective if \nactivities are closely linked to the formulation and implementation of the new civil service law. \nThe country operations business plan 2008\u201320101 includes an advisory TA for supporting civil \nservice reform in the 2008 TA program.2 The November 2007 Fact-Finding Mission reached an \nunderstanding with the Government on the TA's impact and outcome, scope, cost and financing, \nimplementation arrangements, and terms of reference for consultants. Subsequently, some \nadjustments were made based on progress with formulating the new law. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Viet Nam\u2019s current civil service administration, developed under the centrally planned \neconomy system, needs substantial reform to meet requirements resulting from recent rapid \nsocioeconomic development. It needs to more effectively satisfy the needs of customers and \nfocus on results and outcomes. This requires a review of the entire civil service administration, \nfollowed by activities to improve organizational and individual performance. \n \n3.  By  the  end  of  2006,  of  the  approximately  1.8  million  civil  servants,3 240,000  were \nemployed by government agencies4 and 1.4 million by public service providers such as schools \nand health centers. The remaining 160,000 were employed by the National Assembly, the Office \nof the Government, people\u2019s courts, people\u2019s prosecutors, and party agencies. \n \n4.  The career employment system is one of the weaknesses of the current civil service. \nGuaranteed  lifetime  employment  and  seniority-based  promotion  systems  have  made  the \nGovernment\u2019s  human  resource  management  rigid  and  inflexible,  and  tend  to  lower  civil \nservants\u2019  motivation  to  improve  their  outputs.  Generic  and  unclear  job  descriptions  have \nresulted in recruitment difficulties, i.e., recruiting the most suitable person for the position. \nAmong various selection criteria, importance is attached to academic background rather than \nthe candidate\u2019s overall competence to pursue the specific task. Weak job descriptions create \ndifficulties for performance evaluation because the rater and the ratee often do not share a clear \nand common understanding of the required competence and tasks to be accomplished. Many \ngovernment agencies do not have an well-articulated human resource management plan based \non an overall organization-specific business plan. This inhibits effective staff recruitment and \npromotion, and development and provision of appropriate training programs. Existing training \ncourses are designed to meet general requirements. They tend to be similar to school classes \nand in many cases do not offer specific knowledge required for specific assignments. \n \n5.  One of the main objectives of the 2001\u20132010 Public Administration Reform Master \nProgram  is  to  build  a modern  and  professional  public  administration  by  improving quality, \ncompetence, and ethics of civil servants; and improving operating efficiency and effectiveness \nof  government  agencies  and  public  service  providers.  Several  initiatives  have  been \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2007. Country Operations Business Plan (2008\u20132010): Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. Manila. \n2  The concept clearance was given on 21 November 2007. The TA first appeared in the business opportunities \nsection of ADB\u2019s website on 30 January 2008.  \n3  The figure is indicated in the background paper attached to the draft civil service law submitted to the National \nAssembly in May 2008. It includes central and district civil servants; the 190,000 commune civil servants are not \nincluded. \n4  Central government agencies employ 48.5%. \n ", "2   \nimplemented to achieve this objective. The revision of the Ordinance of Public Officials and Civil \nServants  in  2003  promoted  decentralization  of  human  resource  management  of  technical \nofficials to line ministries and local governments. Salary reform increased minimum and average \nsalaries for civil servants. Basic training courses are now mandatory for all civil servants.  \n \n6.  To promote civil service reform, the Government decided to establish a civil service law. \nThe Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA) prepared a draft law and submitted it to the National \nAssembly in May 2008. The proposed law will address existing issues and problems, and \ninitiate substantial transformation of the all civil service institutions to meet emerging needs. \n \n7.  The draft law proposes introducing position-based management. This helps develop \nclear  and  specific  job  description  and  classify  civil  servants  by  qualifications,  tasks,  and \nresponsibilities. This is one of the conditions that enables fair and open performance evaluation, \nand a results-based civil service management system. The draft law proposes to distinguish civil \nservants employed by government agencies from those employed by public service providers. \nThis will contribute to the process of delegating authority to public service providers and improve \nthe quality of public service delivery. It is also expected to be an important step toward reform \nfor civil servants\u2019 salaries. \n \n8.  However, improvements are still needed in the draft civil service law. A shift from the \nsystems of lifetime employment and seniority-based ranking to the merit-based system must be \nclearly articulated in the law to ensure accountability in performance evaluation and promotion \nof civil servants. As the basis for recruitment, training, and performance evaluation, minimum \nstandards  of  qualifications  for  all  civil  service  positions  should  be  identified.  The  training \nprogram needs to be reformed to accommodate specific needs of different civil service positions. \nA mechanism to monitor the training programs should be introduced to maintain the quality of \ntraining. The National Assembly, considering the deficiencies in the draft law, asked MOHA to \nstrengthen the draft and resubmit it for approval at the Assembly\u2019s fall 2008 session.  \n \n9.  Civil service reform is a long-term process. Establishment of an action plan with clear \npriorities, timeline, responsibilities, and resources is recommended to support implementation of \nthe  proposed  civil  service  law.  Furthermore,  the  related  decrees  and  circulars  to  guide \nimplementation of the law should be issued promptly following approval of the law. The TA will \nhelp strengthen the contents of the draft law, and implement the law efficiently and thoroughly. \n \n10.  ADB has been involved in the early stages of development of the draft law. Under TA to \nsupport  implementation  of  training  reform, 5  ADB  facilitated  an  international  consultative \nworkshop in June 2006 for government officials to learn experiences and practices in civil \nservice reform in People\u2019s Republic of China, New Zealand, Thailand, and United Kingdom. \nSubsequently, ADB supported MOHA in organizing two consultation workshops in December \n2007 to discuss the draft law with various stakeholders. The United Nations Development \nProgramme and Swedish International Development Assistance have expressed willingness to \ncoordinate with ADB in helping prepare and implement the civil service law. \n \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2002.

The expected impact of the TA is enhanced quality of public service delivery as a result \nof simplifying administrative procedures of public agencies and improving efficiency of public \ninvestment. The TA is expected to develop an integrated civil service reform policy framework to \nfacilitate the introduction of results-based management in the civil service The policy framework \nwill help (i) introduce a merit-based system with clear and specific job descriptions and minimum \nqualification standards for all civil service positions; (ii) ensure fair and accountable recruitment, \nperformance evaluation, and promotion; and (iii) improve training programs to meet specific \nneeds of civil servants.  \n \n12.  The TA has three expected outputs: (i) strengthened draft civil service law, (ii) facilitation \nof implementation of the law, and (iii) capacity building. The first output will provide underlying \nprinciples and key directions for reforming current civil service management, and introduce \nthese principles in the revised draft law. The second output will contribute to the creation of an \nenabling environment for implementation of the new law; and the third output will help build \ncapacity to guide and monitor implementation of the law. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n \n13.  The activities to be covered by the TA include (i) consolidated diagnostic studies on \nexisting civil service management including review of related laws and regulations; (ii) analysis \nof experiences and lessons of other countries in reforming management of their civil service;  \n(iii) identification of areas that need improvement in existing civil service management and \npreparation of recommendations for improvements; (iv) formulation of a public service reform \npolicy framework; (v) review of the current draft civil service law and identification of deficiencies; \nand (vi) finalization of the draft law for submission to the National Assembly for approval at its \nfall  2008  session.  The  TA  will  assist  the  Government  in  implementing  the  law  through \ndevelopment of decrees and/or circulars to guide implementation of the law. An action plan \nidentifying specific actions to be taken with clear priorities, time frame, responsibilities, and \nresources will be developed and executed under the TA. \n \n14.  The TA will help the Government promote the understanding and commitment of civil \nservants to civil service reform. The TA will support the organization of dissemination workshops \nto  provide  key  central  and  provincial  stakeholders  with  information  on  (i)  the  importance, \nrationale, mandate, and key issues of the new law; and (ii) policies to reform civil service \nmanagement institution under the law. The TA will help with capacity development activities \nsuch as training courses for personnel managers, particularly for MOHA officials, focusing  \n(i)  human  resource  management,  (ii)  change  management,  and  (iii)  leadership  and \nmanagement.  Close  collaboration  with  the  national  training  institutions  in  designing  and \ndelivering training courses is needed to ensure sustainability of the training programs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,250,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $1,000,000 on a \ngrant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will finance $250,000 equivalent, \nmainly in kind, by providing counterpart staff, office space, furniture, administrative support \nservices, logistics, and necessary data. The details of the cost estimates and financing plan are \nin Appendix 2. \n ", "4   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  MOHA will be the Executing Agency for the TA and MOHA\u2019s Civil Service Department \nwill be the focal point for TA implementation. MOHA, through the Civil Service Department, will \nprovide overall guidance for TA implementation, ensure interagency coordination, and issue \nappropriate directives and decisions. MOHA will appoint a senior official as project director. The \nproject working group will comprise representatives from related MOHA departments and other \ngovernment agencies. To facilitate smooth TA implementation, the working group will meet \nquarterly and as required to monitor TA implementation progress and ensure the TA objectives \nare achieved. ADB will participate in the working group meetings.  \n \n17.  The TA will have two phases: (i) finalization of the draft civil service law for submission to \nthe 2008 fall session of the National Assembly (phase 1), and (ii) facilitation of implementation \nof the new law and capacity building (phase 2). Phase 1 will require 3.5 person-months of \ninternational and 7 person-months of national consulting services. The international consultants \nwill provide expertise in overall civil service management (2 person-months) and performance \nmanagement  and  competency-based  management  (1.5  person-months).  The  national \nconsultants  will  provide  expertise  in  legal  aspects  (3.5  person-months)  and  civil  service \nmanagement (3.5 person-months). They will be selected and contracted individually as they are \nneeded urgently to help the Government finalize the draft law and submit it to the National \nAssembly for its 2008 fall session. Phase 2 will require 13 person-months of international and \n30 person-months of national consulting. The international consultants will have expertise in \noverall  civil  service  management  (8 person-months),  performance  management  and \ncompetency-based management (3 person-months), and code of conduct (2 person-months). \nThe national consultants will provide expertise in legal aspects (8.5 person-months), civil service \nmanagement  (11.5  person-months),  capacity  building  (5  person-months),  and  advocacy  \n(5 person-months).

The TA will engage international \nand domestic resource persons who have expertise in civil service reform and capacity building. \nADB will engage consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in \nAppendix 3. Procurement of equipment for the TA will be undertaken in accordance with ADB's \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  equipment  will  be \ntransferred to MOHA upon TA completion. A study tour will be organized for senior officials \ndirectly involved in implementing the law. The objective of the study tour will be to share the \nbest practices and hands-on experiences in civil service reform in other countries, particularly \nthose with similar reform processes.  \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 3 years, from September 2008 to September 2011. \nEach individual consultant and the consulting firm are required to produce the following major \nreports:  (i)  an  inception  report  describing  the  detailed  work  program  3  weeks  after \ncommencement of the assignment, (ii) progress reports during the assignment, and (iii) a final \nreport describing the detailed findings and recommendations with regard to the specific tasks \nassigned  before  completion  of  the  assignment.  The  consultants  will  submit  reports  and \ndocuments to MOHA (in English and Vietnamese) and ADB (in English). ADB will conduct \ninception and review missions, and participate in tripartite meetings involving the Government, \nADB, and consultants to review TA progress.  \n \n ", "  5 \nIV.
